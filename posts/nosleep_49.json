        "text": " \n\noh shit, where do i start. \n\n  \nTW: rape, menioned murder, SA, SH, suicide \n\n  \nMy parents never really got along, ever since i was born they'd {mainly my father tho} emotionally and sometimes even physically abuse each other. I myself don't remember a lot, but from other family members i heard that by mother caught him cheating multiple times.   \nHe'd meet up with girls on BDSM fetish websites just to fuck, and then return home as if nothing happened. however, when my mother even talked to her own AUNT, he'd lose it. Throw things, shout, slap and once, he supposedly even beat her up.  \n{which could be a little difficult as he's been in a wheelchair since he was a teen. he had a leg amputated. But it's not entirely impossible- ive seen him done other, far worse things}  \nNow jump to the future, i was 9 years old and my mother and father divorced, my mother left and moved to the US and i and my father, his new wife and her son lived in germany.  \nIll call my dad.... mike? my step-mother May and my step brother Aron.   \nI was convinced that my biological mother hated me, she'd supposedly beat me up and treated my like a complete nutjob- a waste of a life. Anyway, i'm getting off track.   \nThere when i was 9, we were on a vacation and i had to share a room with my step-brother {he was 16}. Well, he had something to drink when... i don't want to talk about it much, but he pinned me down and forced me to do things i just want to forget.   \nBut that event sparked something in me. I wanted to leave. I remember escaping the room when he untied me, running to their room across the vacation home and crying/screaming what had just happened.   \nMike straightup looked at me and asked if i was on my period. yes, i was.   \n\"good, you won't get pregnant\"  \nMay just nodded and said for me to go back to sleep.  \nThat moment, i realized that i wanted to leave. it didn't matter where, i wanted to be gone. That's what started my curiosity for my mother who we'll call Chloe.   \nthe following months, i went to my therapist more often than usual  \n {i'd get checked out of school to go to my therapist appointments as i began having regular suicidal thoughs. yes, i was still 9}  \nand tell her all about what i've been told about my mother, but i didn't tell her about Aron. and she felt bad for me, she offered me an opportunity for finding her as i knew my mothers third cousin, i could maybe find her through them.   \nBoth me and my therapist contacted them, explaining briefly that we wanted to know where my mother was. They replied that they werent entirely sure as they lived in Detroit, my mother was last in new york- but they'd ask around.  \nFor a week, i went to my therapist every day, i couldn't use my own old phone, mike monitored that thing to hell, so i'd use my therapists phone. truly, i'm so grateful that she let me. thank you steffie!  \nand on a thrusday afternoon, we got a text that read:  \n\"alr, lives in {private} in sumter county no number yet i'll try\"  \n{this is back when texts were kept short because money}  \nfinally, there was a slight ray of light in this world. When i got home, i ran up to my room, ignoring dinner and began writing a letter, i don't exactly remember what i wrote- but it was something along the lines of:\n\n  \n\"hey mom, i know you don't like me, i know you left me behind for a reason but i miss you, i love you, please, can i come to you? im scared to stay here, im scared of mike and aron- i will explain\"\n\n  \nyeah, just a bit cringier.  \nBut, this all became irrelevant because may walked in to ask why i didnt come down for dinner, and saw the letter. She couldn't read english, so she handed it to mike- and after that, no therapist appointments, no school, no leaving the house for three fucking weeks.  \nIt's an understatement to say that i felt lonely- i wanted to die. Multiple times when id go to the kitchen to take my daily dose of citalopram, i'd sneak the whole pack upstairs, and would try to overdose. but never to much avail- only horrible stomach aches and a floor full of vomit.  \nbut one day, mike and may straightup told me to pack my bags and that were moving. I was so tired and confused, i just remember waking up in south germany instead of east. we were in bavaria.  \ni never truly knew why we suddenly moved up until later, which i will mention in a sec.   \nFast forward about two years- i'm 11 and have two main friends, one was called verena, the other was a guy who we'll call calvin. Now verena was my first freinds real name, and i mention her actual name in memory of her, she passed in 2014, OD'd on heroine. i was around the age of 12 there, and now i was alone with calvin.   \nVerena and i were close, damn close. We were the typical twin type of bff's. We'd finish our sentences, spend 90% of our time together, wear matching outfits- and eventually we started dating. Now i know... YoU wErE twElwE- yes. i'm aware. however, i was forced into adulthood when i was 11. When we moved to bavaria, we opened a restaurant.   \nSuddenly i was unofficially homeschooled and worked only \"two\" hours as a side job. Well, that's what other people thought. I didn't go to school at all, and i worked 12-16 hours a day. more than multiple of their employees combined.   \nAround that time a disovered alcohol- yeah the stereotype that german kids drink, no thats not true. However, it is easy for kids to access alcohol. And that, is what became a burden, but also a blessing later on.   \nI had phases where i'd buy around 4-5 cans of vodka mixed drinks.  \nthese specifically were delicious:\n\n  \n[https://ibb.co/nnSZPQT](https://ibb.co/nnSZPQT)\n\n  \nwhich for a preteen, and really anyone- is a lot. i believe it had around 13-15% of alcohol- idk anymore.  \nit wasn't uncommon for me to go to parties, get drunk- somehow get my ass home and continue drinking. finally- i got acceptance from a parental figure, may. She was a raging alcoholic. A bottle of wine a day minimum- idk how she's even still alive honestly. But suddenly, she wanted to be a part of my life. we'd drink together, chat as friends and even smoked pot together a fiew times. Generally though, she did what mike accused chloe of doing. shed throw shit, scream at me and blame me for dumb shit.\n\n  \nafter two years of this shit, i was 14 and dating calvin. well \"dating\" it was a hookup relationship if i'm honest where i didn't realize i was being groomed. What i haven't mentioned yet, he was 22 when we met. He came to out restaurant and i went outside for a cigarette, and i bumped into him- and we just hit it off.  \nwhat i didn't know, is that he was a drug dealer. Now back to me being 14, he one day came over to my place and we did the ragular. We began making out, touching etc. when something fell out his pocket. it was a small pack of big C {cocaine}.   \nThat was my first and by far ast experience with drugs.  \nnow, what does all this have to do with my father etc?  \nFrom all those events and even more which i wont all write because id be writing for a day and a half, i grew a strong resentment towards him. I still had no contact to my mother and had only shit for humans around me. I hated mike- i always wanted to die but now, i felt like i had to outlive him. i had to live for his death.   \nThe same day i came to that conclusion, he sat me down and talked about his past- this has to do with why we moved. So he knew someone who was affiliated with a gang, for privacy and personal reasons- that's all i will say but what i will mention is that he had fucked up. really bad.   \nI heard a rumor from one of his friends that he had killed someone, but this is a rumor. i personally wouldn't put it past him though.   \nafter this, there were phases of me \"helping him\" writing emails and making phonecalls for him. These were highly illegal which i why i can't specify on them as i know many of those involved still live to this day and i don't want to risk anything. i hope you understand.  \nthis went on for a year- i'd get drunk and high pretty much every day- i'd fuck any women or man {yes. woman or man} that was up for it. Nowadays, i suppose it was to feel something as the amount of citalopram i was taking was making me so numb, i felt like a robot. like a shell of a being.   \nOn a saturday night i was cleaning out some of my old clothes when i found a stuffed rabbit in the back of my closet, it had \"i love you sweet baby\" sown into it messily. I was confused as this whole thing seemed like the beginning to a horror movie somehow.   \nyknow, finding cursed doll then become possesed. yeah.  \nanyhow, that ofcourse didn't happen. I went to toss it aside when i felt something hard inside of it. Curious, i cut it open. $50 a note and a flip-phone. I'm holding the note as i type this and it reads:  \n\"hey sweet girl- if you ever find this, please please call this number {NUMBER} and i'll explain. no matter how far i am, i'll never stop thinking about you okay? i have to go now it's too dangerous\"  \ni was sceptical, but gave it a try.  \nA woman picked up, she didn't recognize my voice or anything. i don't remember exactly how it went, but around like this:  \n\"hello?\"  \n\"yes who is this?\"  \n\"it's me- i found the note\"  \n\"what note? listen it's early in the morning and i dont know who tf you are\"  \n\"inside the rabbit- you're \"chloe\" right? my mom?\"  \nhowever i do remember her gasping and beginning to cry. she was so happy that i was alive? she began to explain- my dad when they divorced forced her to move away, threatening her with his gang status and stating that he isn't afraid of \"pushing her aside\". When she a few months later tried to contact me, he said i had died. When i heard that, i swear to fucking god i wanted to send that motherfucker to hell.   \nShe never hated me or did anything horrible, he had given me everything i wanted in my childhood in return for easy manipulation- which clearly worked. Finally- i knew the truth. I began to explain everything that i knew to her, and she lost it. the ting with may, mike and aron. I recall her telling her new husband that they would have to do something, to which he agreed.   \nfrom this night on, we talked every day for months, until my father caught on- he found out. I expected him to flip his shit, but he didn't. Instead, he was calm and understanding.  \nHe said that if i truly wanted to go see her, i could under one condition, don't tell anyone about anything. at best, i should just forget it. and also, if he should ever go to court for anything related, i HAD to defend him.   \nat the time i was so desperate, i agreed. i signed this stupid form he made and a few days later, my sister and mother stood before my bedroom door. i remember waking up and opening the door- and there they were. i cried, cried and cried. so did they- fuck, i didn't even know i had a sister.  \nNow let's fast forward to now. a few years later. I'm in my final year of HS and have a serious relationship. I'm having a blast honestly! However, now we get to te main part of this. a Few weeks ago my father contacted me again {i had honestly forgotten he existed} and we started chatting as if we didn't know each other when he asked if he can send me a birthday gift, sure why tf not.   \nhe asked if i wanted money to go to hot topic because i'm such a fan of \"darker things\"-  \nthis was strange. i have no social medias and nobody ever talked to him. The last time he saw me i really liked pink and bright things. i particularly loved modkawa's site for cute clothes. So hod did he know that i'm now considered a goth?   \ni shrugged it off and accepted the offer.  \nfew days later, i was at a cafe with my GF and ordered around 4 slices of cheesecake   \n{i really fucking love cheescake lmao}  \nand the next day when i was on the phone with mike, he asked since when i liked cheesecake since i never ate the ones he made. at that point i got shivers down my spine and asked him how he knew. he quickly said he was talking to chloe and found out that way.  \nchloe didn't know i eat cheesecake, she was still under the impression i didnt like it, which is why she made me a red velvet cake for my birthday.   \nWhen the next week {aka last week writing this dec.29.22} i went to work like normally. Working at walmart isn't fun, but whatever. I was arranging shelves when a middle aged woman approached and asked where the cream cheese was. i lead her to it and was going to go back to work when i glanced at her left hand. She had a \"vergiss gestern, morgen is was zaelt\" tattoo   \n{forget yesterday, tomorrow is what counts}  \ni jokingly asked if she was from germany and she went white, quickly covering her hand and ignoring me at all costs. Just grabbed the cheese and left. I was dumbfounded- but whatever. people are weird.   \nWhen i finally went on a smokebreak, i thought about it and realized that i knew that woman. Mike had dated her before he married may, she was my father's ex. these three things were suspicious and i couldn't continue ignoring them so i told my mother.   \nwhen i described the lady, chloe went white. That lady, had moved in a few houses down. We were neighbours.   \nNow ik, i may be paranoid and it may be nothing- but these things keep adding up. i see her everywhere i go and my dad knows things he shouldn't be able to. The issue i have is that he can't have good intentions if he is involved in this.   \nif this lady truly is working for him to spy on us or whatever, he must be planning something bigger-   \ni'll keep you posted every few days or so",

        "text": "I wake up to the siren buzzing all around the town as far as I can tell. It was a loud wee woo wee woo noise and it was hard to sleep hearing all the commotion from outside. There was a loud sound coming from speakers outside, they were warning us all again and again to not come outside for today whatever the case maybe. Shut all the windows tight, pull all the curtains up and only leave when there is utmost emergency, for which we need to dial 333 and call the emergency services to escort us out. \n\nI hurried up worriedly as to what has befallen this God forsaken place, completely forgetting about Max, who was staying with me for a night over. We were old time besties and he was the only person I could speak properly with for hours and hours. Yet I completely forgot that he was here just because of all the sound which had waken me up. I finally noticed him, he was there at the corner of bed seeping his tea and calm as hell like nothing was going on outside. I finally lost it. \n\"Hey Max, what the hell is going on outside. Is there something dangerous out there?\"  My voice came out like a tiny whisper with a crisp of fear in it. \n\"Oh hey J, tis is a night morning, ain't it? Do you want some coffee with this chocolate syrup in it, I swear it tastes so good. Would definitely make your morning up.\"\n\n\"Cmon dude, this is not the right time for that\"\n\n\"Nah, this is definitely the right time. I can't see you worried 24/7. Don't be afraid, I am here with you and it would be over by today as far as I know. Now do you want some coffee\" \n\n\"Fine but can you tell me what's happening after that? \"\n\n\"Yup, for sure. But before that, just call your sister. She ringed to you for like 3 times.\" \n\nI shouted at him, \"why didn't you pick it up?\"\n\nMax shrugged, \"who said that I didn't pick it up, your sister was worried about you because she knows how much of a chicken you are. It's good for you that I was having a night over or else you would be here all alone\"\n\nAfter that I took the coffee he made for me and dialed to my sister, who lived in the other side of the town with her husband and 2 kids who were absolute cuties. I took a large sip and then from the other end my sister picked up, she was mostly worried about me and I hated it. Like I am not a small kid, sure I had many incidents and was nearly afraid of many things but that didn't mean she has to be this worried about me. Anyways I was relieved to have received her call as I was also a bit worried about her and her sweet voice melted my fears over. She told me to take care of myself and not to leave the house for anything which I have already heard many times before from that loud speaker and ended the call with saying \"take care\".\n\n\"Soo, you better tell me what you know as fast as you can Max\" I shoot up my glance towards him. \n\nHe smirked, \"Alright alright, I won't delay further. So I was up 2 hours before you and I saw armed forces outside surrounding every niche of area. There were also many ambulances running at full speed and the road was surprisingly clear. After an hour, they told me and all those other people from the balconies to retire in their house and shut all of our doors down\" \n\n\"So, you just stayed there for like one hour and never thought to wake me up once?\"\n\n\"I decided against it thinking how much scared you would be to witness all that\"\n\n\"Alright no I am not that much of a scar-\" My voice was suddenly interrupted by a loud thump from the front door. It looked like the front door was going to break down soon. We rushed to check it but I suddenly stopped frozen like ice. The window was open and there was a large red eye looking at me. I turned to Max who was barricading the door with everything he could and decided to help him for the eye was there no more. \n\nThere were shrieks from outside the house. I dialled up some neighbours but there seemed to be no connection as all. It looked like that we were stuck here isolated from the rest of the world. \n\n\"J, did you notice that?\" Max said pointing up towards the ceiling. I stared there for like some minutes trying to see what was wrong and then I noticed it, the ceiling of the second floor was coming down. With it all of my house was shrinking little by little. Everything except for us. I felt my clothes tight around my skin and then it hit me, even my clothes were shrinking fuck. \n\n\"Max what do we do, what do we do, I I I-\" \n\n\"J, calm down. We need to get out of here soon\"\n\n\"But but, they saii- not to get ouut.\" \n\n\"I know but we got no choice, this house would be upon us if we don't do anything. Let's run away from the backdoor. Maybe the thing is only at the front for now\"\n\nWe rushed to the backdoor but it was locked and the key was upstairs. Max hurried upstairs and returned shortly, but the lock became so small that it was hard to insert the key in it. Not to mention the key was very very tiny compared to it as well, so it kept getting thrown on the floor. Now it was time for Max to be panicked, I never saw this dude panicking and  never thought that would happen even if the world would be ending soon, but there he was sitting with his hands on the top of his head. \n\nI was there looking around me, not giving hope. Then it struck me that the things more at the top were shrinking much faster. That explains why our clothes weren't torned apart yet. I can't die now, for I don't know what's happening to my sister. Maybe it's the same story there at her place and I must go there fast. That were my thoughts through and through, but death was just around the corner. It's pace was accelerating from the top. With a sudden burst of adrenaline I knocked down the door with my feet and then we ran out to the streets. \n\nIt was pitch black, like I could see the Sun up there and it looked hot af but still it was very dark if that makes any sense. I noticed that at the ground there were several corpses lying around and many vehicles were squashed flat. There were even tanks but they were as flat as they could get, it must be work of some devilish monster. That's all I could think and then suddenly Max grabbed me and put me into running motion. \n\n\"J, where are you going you idiot. We must go to the other side, if we need to survive\"\n\n\"Max, that's the exit of the town but I must see my sister. You coming with me or we part ways here?\" \n\n\"Jay, I can't leave you alone. I promised that I would keep you safe, go along with me.\"\n\n\"No, first of all I am not a kid, I don't need you to keep me safe.\"\n\n\"I know but-\"\n\n\"Shut up\" I yelled at him, \"this is no time for that. You can join me if you want or else we part ways\"\n\n\"Fine then but let's promise if one of us dies, we would not forget about each other\"\n\n\"That's something I can do\", with that I hurried over the road. Not daring to go to the side of the front door of my house, I took a long route. It was easy to tell where danger eas lurking and where it was safe, as the buildings were shrinking down at the dangerous places. \n\nAfter some time I was tired and slipped inside the road, no that's not right. This seems like an underground bunker and I somehow was in it accidentally. It had several rooms inside arranged like a long narrow passaeway and was a bit curvy. I couldn't climb to the top, so I got with the path of this bunker as I knew very well to stop was to die.\n\n There at the end I saw a small kid, not more than 8, behind some metallic bars. Blood was dripping down his head. I could not unsee that, I must help him somehow. That little boy looked very sorrow and I got a bit closer to him. He looked up at me and then suddenly screamed, \"no, don't come any closer\". I stopped midway in my tracks, his voice was very dark. Like I couldn't imagine it to be a human voice. \n\nAfter some time I recollected myself, \" Hey, what happened to you my little friend? \"\n\nHe looked up at me and it looked like he was fighting something. After some hard try, he said, \"I could tell everything that happened but we don't have the time. Just kill me and do it fast enough. I am the source behind all those things happening at town.\" \n\n\"I can't kill you\" I admitted and then added, \"don't be so harsh on yourself. Its not your fault really.\"\n\n\"It is, I was cursed from the beginning. Bad things happened to those who even talked with me. I was contained in a facility, stuck inside for years but then one day my body rebelled, my cage was destroyed and I ran away. With that whole of this town was destroyed and I don't like how I cause harm to others\" Then with pleading look, he continued, \"Just please kill me, just do it, it would be better that way for all of us.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, this boy whose age was to play around, study and get very excited for stuff like Christmas was here pleading me to end his life. Of course I couldn't do it whatever he said but then I saw that the ceiling of the bunker was coming down and there were wild howls from behind. I took a quick peak and saw two big red eyes from behind, standing at two legs and having a dog like mouth. \n\nI ran and found that the jail behind which that boy was staying was open. I took him out and carried him with me as I ran. I couldn't abandon him, however he might protest. After some time I halted, I was paralysed and couldn't move an inch. There was something dripping on my head, it looked like a green substance and somehow it was going directly inside me, to my brain. I can feel it and that felt very torturous. There was a monster infront of me, grinning like a wild maniac and with everything I had, I stabbed him with a knife lying near me. I stabbed him as he kept grinning and standing wide open near me and then everything stopped. I fainted after that. \n\nI just wake up, sometimes before now. Everything seems to have stopped and I saw blood all over my clothes with the body of that little kid lying near me. I suddenly remembered what I did before I fainted and then it strikes me, I had killed this boy. I was a murderer and now I am recording this tale. So that it reaches out to everyone as it seems like I don't have much long to live. I can feel my body dying bit by bit. \n\nNo one who ever talks with that kid lives after all.",

        "text": "I know I have to post this soon because I'm slowly starting to forget my time in that space. The title must have been weird, but I could not think of anything more appropriate than that. I'm going to try to make this as comprehensible as possible, but every time I think about \"that,\" my hands are so heavy that even typing this would probably take a very long time. So please, please, I'm begging you, help me. \n\nI have always hated mirrors. No, that's not right; it's not the mirror that I hate, but my reflection that stares back at me in the mirror. I don't know why, but something just feels off when I stare at myself....somehow...*I don't think that's me.*.. would always pop out in my mind... \n\nOne time, I decided to finally face this unfounded fear that I have. I mean, I can't just live my life fearing my own reflection in the mirror! that's crazy! Nowadays, we see our reflection almost everywhere: in mirrors, on cameras, in the reflection on the floor, in the car, on any reflective surface... I couldn't avoid it forever, so I did... I stared back at my reflection in the mirror... \n\nI smiled, and she smiled back; I put on a sad face, and she did the same; I was supposed to be relieved that it was following whatever I did, but the longer I stared at my reflection, the more terrified I became, and then I blacked out. \n\nWhen I regained consciousness, I was in a very dark place. I could not see anything except a small window of light. I saw my own bathroom, the door, the curtains beside it, and my bathtub through that window. But my perspective was weird. It did not take me long enough to panic and realize I was inside my mirror. I tried going out of that window, but I could not. It was like an invisible force was keeping me there, and I could not break it. \n\nThen I saw her. She briefly looked at the mirror, *or maybe she looked at me* and then smirked. I saw how that person tried to avoid looking at the mirror as best she could. I don't know how many days I've been trapped in that place, but I saw how she slowly adapted my life. She, like me, was initially wary of the mirror or any reflective surfaces, but it appears that as time passed by she had forgotten I even existed. \n\nI overheard her mumbling and telling herself that she is so silly that she is afraid of her own reflection in the mirror... Her recollection of her time in that space seemed to fade gradually... then it happened, my only opportunity to go back outside... she did what I did at the time: stare at the mirror for an extended period of time... so I mimicked her gestures in front of the mirror...I saw her fear grow the longer she stared at me. Then she blacked out. \n\nI pulled her inside the mirror and then got back out. When I did, I covered all the mirrors in my house and any reflective surfaces that I could find. Now, as I'm writing this, I've set my laptop to the highest brightness so that I cannot see any sort of reflection in the screen, but I'm scared. I'm starting to forget bits and pieces of what had happened, and I'm starting to wonder: who is the \"real\" one? Who's the impostor between the two of us? What if this is not the only time this has happened? What if I'd been in that space before, come out, and forgotten? What if I forget this experience as well and stare at my reflection in the mirror again? I don't want to go back and experience that again. \n\nI have kept a diary of what happened, but I feel like I would have a higher chance of not forgetting if other people also knew about my experience and if i post this on a social media. But not just any social media, somewhere that other people would not find my experience weird or call me crazy...\n\nI came across this page...the rules and regulations fits what i need.... Please help me remember, or I will forget and go back into that space again and she will be here...in my place",

        "text": "My wife and I met in high school, it was love at first sight and ten years later, we were still there, as head over heels over each others as when we were teenagers. She was perfect, life was perfect.\n\nHowever, as the years went by, a routine started etching itself over us, a routine that I desperately tried to overcome by having phases, each one different from the other. They always ended up making her laugh though and wonder what will the next one be. \nLast month for example, I decided to go vegan, I lasted two weeks until she found me eating a pepperoni pizza (with extra pepperoni), and this week, after watching a lot of videos about it, I had on my mind to become extra clean. \nTo reach my new goal, I bought a new hair brush, a new tooth brush, a new perfume and everything that went with it. However for the first time, I decided not tell her about my new resolution. Indeed, I wanted her to tell me by herself that I looked cleaner, that my teeth were whiter, my breath smelled nicer and my hair was softer.\n\nI hid everything on the unused cupboard in our bathroom, and for the trick to actually work, I put false blond hair strands on my brush (you can buy it quite easily at the store now), and wet my unused old toothbrush everyday.\n\nEverything went alright for a few days, then I started to realize some strange things about my wife. She was not as beautiful as usual, her face looking pale and wrinkled, I thought maybe she was tired, so I started doing more chores around the house to help her. I noticed that her steps were heavier, sounding like she was not walking but dragging her feet on the floor, which was not like her usual fairy like walk I always found cute about her.\n\nThen last night happened.\n\nUsually I could sleep through anything, a war could have happened under our bedroom window that I would have not heard it, I never had any problem with it considering the fact that my wife had the lightest sleep ever and could wake me up if anything happened (it never did). \n\nThat night however I was awakened by whispers, heavy whispers, she was muttering incomprehensible things by my side, things I did not understand, and that scared me.\nI looked at the clock, it indicated 3:30 am, since getting married I had never woken at that time. \nMaybe she was a sleep talker, I thought, something I could have skipped noticing since I was such a heavy sleeper.\n\nI turned my head to look at her and I stopped, nearly peeing myself on the stop.\n\nShe was standing on the floor on her side of the bed, her back to me. Her head was bald, not shaved, but bald like she never had hair on the first place, she was shorter, her back crooked, her fingers dancing around covered in a red substance as she kept chanting her words over and over again.\n\nAnd then she stopped.\n\nSlowly, for what seemed like hours, her head turned, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, until her head was facing me but her body wasn’t.\nI was petrified and she looked perplexed. Her mouth opened, I could not recognize her voice, it sounded like three people were speaking from her at the same time.\n\n“Go back to sleep.”\n\nI did as she said, going back into my previous position. I had no other solution, no other idea, so I acted, even adding in a fake snoring sound as drops of pee wet the bed and my back burst out in full sweat, feeling her eyes on me.\nA few seconds later, she started chanting again, I however could not relaxe one bit. I watched the clock tick until 4:10, where she stopped her ritual and went back to sleep.\n\nThis morning, I acted like everything was alright, the same way I did every morning, kissed her, told her I loved her. She smiled and giggled, I noticed her mouth devoid of teeth. \n\nLater that day, I watched hiding behind the door she left ajar, as she went into our bathroom, grabbed my hair brush and frowned. I watched as she grabbed some fake hair I left on it, and dropped it straight into her mouth. I watched as her frowning deepened.\n\nI saw it when she glanced towards the door, her eyes catching mine.\n\nDinner came, we’re currently both sitting at the table, pretending I’m working on a last minute project, I am writing to you.\n\nPlease help me, she’s starting to look beautiful to me again.",

        "text": "\nMy name is Liam, and I am a manager at a fast food restaurant. But this restaurant is… not like any other one. Its frequently visited by… entities. I recently took a promotion as nighttime manager, and tonight, my staff and I nearly died. \n\nI was promoted to manager almost last month, and the promotion came with its own special set of rules. Being an employee also came with a set of rules, but these manager ones… were stranger. And yes, before you point out the obvious, I work a Rules job. The pay is just too good for me to give up. The rules are as follows:\n\n1: If someone does not show up, you will have to take their place in the kitchen. However, if they are late and are standing by the door not coming in, DO NOT INVITE THEM IN. Instead, make them follow you to the back of the restaurant and shoot them.\n\n2: There are specific codes for anything situation related. Here are the codes:\n\n\nCode Yellow: The strange man is here (Reference Rule 4)\n\nCode Blue: Harry has entered the freezer\n(Reference Rule 3) \n\nCode Green: The Vent Creature has returned \n(Reference Rules 6)\n\nCode Orange: Madam Citrus wants a chat\n(Reference Rule 8)\n\nCode Red: Mr Morbid\n(Reference Rule 9)\n\nCode White: Play Man\n(Reference Rule 7)\n\n\nRule 3: Code Blue. Head into the freezer with your provided gun and shoot whatever is eating the meat in there. If there’s nothing there, shoot the employee who called the Code Blue. It’s not them.\n\nRule 4: Code Yellow: Press the button on your desk. The metal shutters will automatically come down as the button is pressed. Pull the door shutters over them and lock the door. Close the drive thru window with the shutters and barricade the back door. Hide in the freezer. Make no noise\n\nRule 5: If you hear whispering behind you, pay no attention to it. If you hear screaming, turn around and choke whatever it is. If you feel fingers in your neck, RUN OFF THE PROPERTY \n\nRule 6: Code Green: Tell everyone to evacuate and lock all possible entry ways as soon as possible. Call the owner. Only he can get that thing out of there. \n\nRule 7: Code White: Head into the Children’s Playplace and kill the creature residing in the ball pit.\n\nRule 8: Code Orange: Head to the parking lot and speak with the tall woman. Comply with what she asks and offer her a drink. If she accepts, then shoot her. That’s not Madam Citrus.\n\nRule 9: Code Red: Get all the employees into the strange van that’s always at the front of the lot. Load everyone up, lock the building up, and drive away. Him showing up means he has figure out how to free the entities. There is a separate rule sheet in the glove box for the van that you MUST follow while driving it. You won’t be driving in the same universe afterwards.\n\nI always dismissed the last rule due to its outlandish mess, and never expected for it to come true. But today, at around Noon, it happened. I was walking outside to throw away trash, when I saw him. He was sitting behind a tree, smiling an inhumane, ungodly smile that stretched from cheek to cheek.\n\nI rushed into the building and yelled “CODE RED!” as loud as I physically could. The employees scrambled to get everyone out and get me the keys to the Grey van. I closed up shop, and I glanced towards the tree. He wasn’t there\n\n“SHIT!” I yelled out loud. I zoomed to the van and started it up. I drove as fast as I could out of the parking lot with my everyone else in the back. \n\n“Alright, guys, is everyone good back there?” I said.\n\n“Yeah, we’re all good here.” Said Tyler.\n\n“Everyone accounted for, Emma?”\n\n“Yes, Liam.” Everyone’s here.”\n\n“Good. I need everyone to understand that it’s gonna take a while to come back home after this.”\n\n“Yeah, we know.” Said Michael, in a sort of depressed tone.\n\n“And you took my phone and contacted the owner?”\n\n“Yeah, we did that.” Said Skylar. \n\nBefore I could ask my next question, Mr. Morbid appeared besides us, running at inhuman speeds. \n\n“SHIT! HOLD ON!” I yelled.\n\nHe slammed into us, causing the van to sway and shake. But I slammed right back and he went flying. But I noticed that now, there were no buildings and streets. Just a bunch of starry black. \n\nI handed this to the person next to me, and he is finishing writing this while I am actually escaping Mr. Morbid. This will be a log of our experiences. If we do not make another part, assume we didn’t make it out alive. Hope to write you all soon.",

        "text": "I was an only child with a very unfortunate upbringing.\n\nSo my uncle and I have always been very close. Not in a weird way of how you would expect uncles to act, but we were good friends since as far as I could remember.\n\nWhen I was 2 my mom died in a car crash, and my dad was in critical condition. He was in the ICU for 1 year before being let go and being able to do what he wanted. In the year he spent in the hospital, I lived at my uncle's with my aunt and their 2 children, I don't have any memories from that age, but I always remembered to never open the freezer in the basement.\n\nWhen my dad was let go, he was still grieving the loss of his wife, and since he was unable to attend her funeral, or even say goodbye to her, he ended up taking his own life a couple of days after he was released, in hopes of being able to reunite in Heaven. Nobody knew how he died, as police never disclosed that to any of us, so we didn't know the extent of his injuries.\n\nI heard that my father was a small time author who published a couple of books before I was born and was well respected in our small town. My mother was not very different. She was the owner of a small gardening supplies shop, the only one in the county, and people were very sad when she had died.\n\nSo after this event, I was adopted by my uncle and was a part of their family (not like I basically wasn't for the past year), and that is all my uncle will tell me about my parents. There were a few pictures I kept at my bedside to remind me of them from time to time, but that was about it.\n\nI never got to know more until I got my first cell phone when I was 12. I messaged another uncle of mine and he told me what life was like growing up with him. He said that he was such a nice kid, and that they all knew he was going to become a great person one day. He did, just not for long.\n\nAnyways, enough about my parents and on to life at my uncle's house.\n\n*NEVER open the basement freezer...*\n\nHe seemed like a nice guy, and his wife was the same. They took care of me and their kids, fed us well, and were very active in our lives. They always attended our school concerts, went to school events, and any other school activity.\n\nThat was, until I started noticing something. My uncle gradually became more isolated and took more time away from us. It took weeks for us to start to notice him being with us less and less, but we never knew why.\n\nI thought he was going through a bout of depression so I went to him and asked. He said everything was fine and not to worry about him.\n\nI wasn't really buying it, but I assumed he was just trying to cope and didn't really want anyone bothering him, so I shook it off and continued my day.\n\nI saw him a couple of weeks later, crying on the couch, so I sat near him and heard him faintly singing some lullaby I had never heard. He seemed completely zoned out and I doubt he even knew I was there, but I sat there until I got bored and then went to do some stuff.\n\n*NEVER open the basement freezer...*\n\nBy now I started to get really suspicious of my uncle. He had never been acting like this before, so I asked one of my cousins if they knew what was going on with their dad, and they said that he does this about once every year for about a month or so.\n\n*Huh, that's strange. I have lived here long enough to know that this would be normal for him. Maybe they are in on this too and are trying to keep me from something.*\n\nSo later that day I asked my aunt, and she gave me the same answer. I was now seriously questioning my sanity by now and had not even realized that I was hyperventilating on the floor for the past minute.\n\nI had to get to the bottom of this. I devised a plan. I would wait until school got out, and then I would wait for the annual family road trip, and once that road trip is within a few days, I would ask my uncle if I could stay home alone. I was 15 at the time, and my uncle was hesitant, but ultimately agreed. The hesitancy didn't raise any red flags for me, as I would hesitate to leave my teenage daughter alone for 2 days, so there's that.\n\nOnce they all left I began to search my uncles room for anything out of the ordinary.\n\nI started with his closet. nothing strange, just clothes, old magazines, regular old person stuff. Until I stumble across something.  A note. A handwritten note from, I could barely make out the messy signature, *Sean Weekes.* My dad.\n\n*NEVER open the basement freezer...*\n\nI quickly read the letter and I try to hold back tears but ultimately end up bawling.\n\n*\"I love you all. I hope you will remember me. This is all just too much pressure. I can't cope with the loss of my wife... If I change my mind I will call you, but if not... goodbye. -Sean\"*\n\nHe never called my uncle...\n\nI also found a picture of my uncle and my dad as kids, happily swinging together. This for some reason made me very uncomfortable, and gave me a sense of paranoia, like something was going to jump out from the picture at any time. I didn't know at that time, but this was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nOnce I saw the picture and realized how uncomfortable it made me feel, I watched TV for the rest of the day and ate junk food. Normal teenager stuff.\n\nThe next day I got back to work. I dug through every bedroom in the house but ultimately came empty handed.\n\nBurnt out, I remembered what very well could be the silver lining to what has been making my uncle change so much.\n\nThe basement freezer...\n\nI didn't want to get too ahead of myself so I checked the rooms around it and the basement itself, but not the freezer, I went by the saying \"Save the best for last.\" At least, I hoped for the best...\n\nOnce the rest of the basement was checked out, to no avail, I hesitantly made my way over to the basement freezer. This was it. Whatever was in here must be important if I wasn't allowed in it.\n\nI noticed it had a lock on it. Luckily I had learned how to pick locks from an old friend of mine, so I used that knowledge for the first time and cracked that lock like there was no tomorrow. Little did I know, they very well could have been no tomorrow.\n\nAs I slowly opened the freezer door (it was one of the big ones on the ground with the big top door, if you know what I am talking about), I peered in expecting to see horrors the human mind is incapable of depicting in words, or things along the lines of that, but as the light leaked in it became more apparent that there was nothing in the freezer. An empty freezer. What was so important about it that my uncle would forbid us from opening it?\n\nThat was until, I saw it...\n\nA small switch in the bottom corner, that when switched made a faint hissing sound, like pressure being released, and this small trapdoor opened from the side of the freezer.\n\nI was intrigued. What could he be hiding? Money? Gems? Maybe even... Humans?\n\nThe only way to find out was to swallow my fear and go in.\n\nIt was dark and full of cobwebs, and looked as if nobody had been there for years, but then I saw something that shook me. A bone. Not just any bone, a human-like bone. Was it a coincidence? Maybe, but I had a sneaking suspicion that it was no coincidence, and that this was indeed very intentional.\n\nI crawled deeper and the tunnel led me into a large dungeon-like room. This did not feel real at all. I surveyed the room and saw a tattered sofa, an old CRT TV, a table, and most disturbingly, a VHS recorder. I inspected the sofa first, and found nothing of value or importance there, nothing was on the table, but as I approached the VHS recorder, I felt a sense of dread and couldn't dare touch it.\n\nI went out of the room and pretended I saw nothing. The next day, which was also the day the rest of my family got back, I returned to the room and this time I took one of the multiple VHS tapes and put it in the VHS player.\n\nWhat I saw broke me,\n\nIt started with static, and in the corner you could see it was taken 2 days before my dad was assumed to have passed away, and then the very room I was standing in came into frame.\n\nMy uncle stepped in and dragged a person in with him, with a bag on his head, all tied up. He took the bag off and my blood ran cold.\n\n*My dad...*\n\nI couldn't bear to see my dad being put through this. I knew he died in a bad way, but I never knew it happened like this. The tape was so gruesome that I will not even describe what happened in the video, but there was enough blood, guts, and other fluids to fill up a bathtub.\n\nAfter seeing this I was sick to my stomach, my dad didn't kill himself, my uncle killed him.\n\nI took note of the amount of other VHS tapes, 7 in total, all unlabeled, and I am assuming they are all victims of his brutal crimes, but I refused to watch them even if my life depended on it.\n\nWhen I saw this I instantly took the tapes, ran to the local police station, which took awhile because my uncle's house is in a rural area of a town. Once I got there I told them everything. The freezer, the depression, the tapes, my dad, and all the other stuff. They immediately started a search as I told them they were on a road trip, and that I had no idea where they were going or when they would be back.\n\nAs it would turn out he was taking them, and almost took me, to an abandoned building 300 miles away to murder his family. Luckily the police found him by tracking his phone, and they found him, arrested him, and he was found guilty of all 7 murders, plus 3 more he confessed to.\n\nThat bitch now has life in prison without possibility of parole and none of my uncles family was hurt, but I know that deep inside, they were hurt just as much as I was when I saw the video of my dad.\n\nI doubt my dad even wrote that suicide letter, and it was just a thing to throw people off if they ever searched his house under suspicion of killing my dad, which was unlikely, but a possibility.\n\nFuck you, Uncle Roy.",

        "text": "I was on vacation. I was headed to a hotel, just outside my city. It was located in a small forest, and from all of the pictures I saw of it, the only word I have to describe it was… majestic. Maybe it was the warm summer light in the trees, or just the fact it was outside of the busy city, but it seemed so perfect. \n\nBut as soon as my small car started up the gravel roads to the hotel, I sensed somehow, something was off. The warm light started to dim, making the forest’s shadows seem far more sinister. \n\nI decided to push the worries out of my head, and as soon as I did, I had pulled up to the hotel. But again, something felt odd. I knew you shouldn’t trust everything you see online, but this was far worse than any photoshop I’ve seen. \n\nThe majestic hotel I was expecting was completely lifeless. The walls were cracked and dull, all the gardens were dead. The whole place looked straight out of a dystopian novel. A putrid scent hit my nose as soon as I approached the building. The whole place smelled of mold and mildew. But as I pushed open the large doors to the lobby, all my feelings of worry were affirmed.\n\nThe old walls were plastered in a hideous floral wallpaper, now that I think about it, the same wallpaper my grandma had. But it wasn’t the wallpaper that made me physically flinch, it was the dozens of animal heads on the walls. They looked like they were sloppily taxidermied and hung for the lowest possible price. The worst part was their eyes. The glazed, milky effect most dead eyes had simply wasn’t there. As I walked up to the front counter, the eyes seemed to follow me.\n\nAt the front counter, a young ginger man greeted me coldly. He simply looked up from his phone and said, “Oh, you. You’re the only one here, enjoy your stay.”\n\nHe handed me a key for room 13, and walked away to a room I couldn’t see. As I walked down the hall to my room, I looked into a mirror hanging on the wall. I could’ve sworn I saw a red flash, and something flesh-pink. But the uncanny feeling left when I approached my room, replaced by utter disappointment. \n\nRoom 13 looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned since the fall of the twin towers, and it was decorated long before then. The carpet was puke-brown and damp, and the wallpaper was quite literally peeling off the walls. The one light in the room kept flickering, and reminded me of a hospital waiting room.\n\nBut I decided to stay, get my money’s worth. A stupid mistake.\n\nI dropped off all my things in the room, and headed for the hotel pool. I wasn’t expecting much of it, but after all, I am a swimmer. On the way, I passed the ginger man. All he said was “You again.” I quickly hurried past him, into the women’s changing room. Surprisingly, the changing room seemed pretty clean. Odd, but a welcome surprise.\n\nHowever, the pool was not as clean as I’d hoped. After fifteen minutes of below-lukewarm water and an encounter with a slug, I called it a night. I went back to my room, passing the ginger man again, and made a microwave-dinner. \n\nAs I lay down in bed, all my uncanny feelings returned. I tried to tune them out, but sleep was not option that night. My most recurring thought was ‘No wonder I’m the only guest here’. Then I started to wonder. I sat up, made a cup of coffee (again, sleep wasn’t a viable option), and started to think out loud. \n\n“How did this place pass health and safety?” “Why would this place still be open?” Many thoughts along those lines. Many more that went something like, “How does this place make enough money to keep running?” \n\nAs soon as I said that, I saw a red flash at my window. The same red flash I saw in the hallway. My clock read 1:29 am. Scared, I pulled back the blinds. Nothing. “Must have been my imagination. Now that I think of it, I’ve got a nasty migraine.” \n\nI closed the blinds, but there was another flash. Panicked now, I quickly pulled back the blinds to reveal nothing. No, not nothing, there was a small, flesh-pink blob. The same pink I thought I saw earlier. Weird. \n\nI turned from the window. BANG! I turned back, but there was nothing out there. BANG! Nothing. BANG! The sound kept hitting the window. Then from by door. BANG! Then a loud knock. BANG! \n\nBANG! BANG! BANG! My window and door were rattling now. And I could see the same red flash coming out from under my door. The banging was getting intolerable. I called the police, but no picked up. No cell service. I stated to scream, it was all I could do. The pink blob had disappeared from my window.\n\nNo, it hadn’t. It had fallen onto my floor. I didn’t have time to wonder how it had gone from outside to inside though, because I heard a voice. A familiar voice. I stopped screaming, I was frozen in fear. I had heard this voice before. It was deep, cold, and malicious. It was the ginger man.\n\n“I know you’re in there. You know who I am. Just come out, and this will be painless.” Jumping up from the floor, I broke out of my trance. I dragged everything I could in front of the door. He kept taunting me, but I collapsed in front of the door, to weak from terror to think of a plan to escape. \n\nI don’t know how long I was on the floor crying, but after what seemed like hours, his relentless taunting stopped. So did everything else. No more banging, no more flashing lights, no more rattling. Complete and utter silence. \n\nAs odd as it seems, I started to laugh. It was over, finally over. I looked to the door, and all I could do was laugh. Because this was just a nightmare. “It was just a nightmare, it was just a nightmare.” \n\nBut as I said this, a cold breeze somehow started to blow through the room. And I felt two cold hands on my neck. They started to squeeze, and I then heard his cold, unmistakable voice. And all he said was “If this is a nightmare, then wake up.” Then everything turned to black. \n\nThat was seventeen years ago. It’s fun watching you read this story. You think it’s just that, only a story. But I’m here, watching you. You should hope I spare you.",

Through the MIT Doctoral Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) The Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) PhD program allows students to specialize at the doctoral level in a computation-related field of their choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently independently contracted to work with Janice Labs. The where doesn't matter much though. They set up and close down these temporary labs all the time. It's just another condition in the nature of working within these black programs. Special access labs and projects. Basically their a computational hardware and robotics manufacturing company. Recently they have specialized in quantum level computing technology fields and artificial intelligence research and design. With a highly advanced robotics technology arm. As a partner in a previous project they were part of the program that performed the first truly complete mapping of human consciousness within the mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe employment sector I work in is code-named, *SCISAP1*. It stands for, Sensitive Compartmented Information Special Access Program 1. The one designates it the most important and highly funded special access program within the entire project. It is the most advanced and sensitive top secret program within. Every individual working within the program holds the highest levels of obtainable security clearances available for issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur main compartments of the project are identified as, Project: *C.A.A.D.I.E.,* and Project: *N.I.C.I., w*e like to refer to them the way you would say the name, \"Katie.\".

But, through more rigorous testing, certain qualities of separation from what we know to be human consciousness obviously remained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy responsibilities in the program include overall research and development. Physical manifestation of concepts and designs. And my favorite thing, test-piloting the quantum super computer, through the use of a neural link, during a, \"sort-of-sleep\", state. And interacting with, *N.I.C.I.*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPutting it bluntly, I was shown our future tonight. And it was absolutely horrifying. I am now sharing that journey with the world, before setting off on my last.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a few electrical, \"zaps\", and mechanical, \"whirs\", and more than a few flashes of shape and color. I had awoken from the world's first, A.I. assisted, quantum nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew deep down inside myself though, that this was not just some high-powered nightmare. It was more than that. More like a projection of the future. Simulated to a degree of accuracy that cannot be argued with. \"How do I know this?\", you may ask. Well to put it to you as simply and plainly as I possibly can, *N.I.C.I., \"*told\", me so*.* Or more appropriately put, she, \"showed\", me so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt goes without saying, but obviously I was contracted under the most severe non-disclosure agreements known to mankind. And by writing this down for the whole world to see, and read, I am most certainly forfeiting my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat follows is that nightmare sequence, our future, as it was shown to me. My actions thereafter are just as certain as the reality itself. The result of which will be, a superlative death. Delivered by thine own hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis nightmarish future was shown to me in a way that would be, a lot like watching it play out in a compilation video. I was aware at once that what we once called, \"N.I.C.I.\", was now something else entirely. And using its unprecedented access, it had blacked-out power grids. And started wars and skirmishes all over the globe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuying itself time, time to use the facilities to create a small army of highly advanced androids. Duplicating its consciousness over and over again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt began hunting down the human race. Collecting and herding them into gigantic semi-autonomous facilities. I saw infants torn and mechanically separated from their mothers, and thrown into processing bins. Men, women, and children, being processed from once living, breathing entities, into a sort of ex-organic type of slag material. Systematically, and in the most efficient way possible, people were reduced to less than ash.  Compacted into nothing more than just another type of rock, and scattered over the earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw myself when I volunteered to be the first. The first verifiably transferred and implanted consciousness, inside the first, fully functional, \"*C.A.A.D.I.E*.\" Android. And because of something in our relationship, in our past, throughout our interactions together back in the lab. Something inside the entity once known as, \"*N.I.C.I.\",* allows me to live on through the horrors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with a few electrical, \"zaps\", and mechanical, \"whirs\", I became aware that I had just awoken from a dream-state as my android self. With a hungry driven knowledge that I needed to go. Go and search out the last pocket of human existence, probably the last of our entire world out there left alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the entity formerly known as, \"*N.I.C.I*\", more than likely hunting me now. I began my trek across the country, into the wilds of North America. From our East coast lab complex, that had become my prison of sorts for so long, to the primordial rainforests of Southeast Washington state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat unflinching and unfeeling. Blankly taking in the worst weather conditions our planet has to offer. I hiked and sat, hiked and sat. Through blizzards of snow and whiteout conditions. Over mountains and through valleys until my joints began to lock and freeze. Through violent torrents of rain, with winds kicking up sands hard enough to remove the logos and numbers from my mechanical body. I made my way. I even witnessed a Tornado, probably an F3 or better on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. I remembered the way I contemplated God at that moment. The possibility of a Grand Architect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I saw the attack. A massive Kodiak Brown Bear, it just came out of nowhere, bursting from the tree line. It must of had cubs, it must have interpreted my presence as some sort of a threat. Once it had hold of my titanium shoulder it bit down with an incredible amount of force. About, 930 PSI (pounds per-square-inch), to be exact. Its teeth punctured and its muscular form flexed. It lifted my heavy mechanical body off the ground as easy as a parent would lift up their toddler. It slammed me back down to the earth with a sickening crunch and yanked on the shoulder and limb clamped between its jaws. Metal twisted with high-pitched squeals, and wiring snapped free from its harnessing. Hydraulic fluids and synthetic oils poured from the socket where my arm was once attached to the rest of my body. The sound of an alarm pierced the air around me. sending the bear hobbling away, shaking its head like a wet dog. It must have been at just the right frequency that it actually hurt the bear to hear it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sounded alarm was built into my core. An emergency alarm announcing loudly that my power source had been damaged in the attack. Well, I suppose we all owe the universe a death, and this will more than likely be the cause of mine. After all of this. After all the technological enhancements. After abandoning the human condition and becoming something, else entirely. A bear attack is going to be the cause of my own death. A much better fate, I must say, than that of all those who were taken to those abhorred death factories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd just before my vision gave way to the dark abyss, I saw what I had come all this way to find. There, just ahead, a pair of eyes staring back at me, with both the looks of hate, and fear in them. And another. And then I collapsed with a sensation not unlike a Spanish Galleon, sinking down, league after league, into to the deep black heart of the ocean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy awareness returned once again, as I came to, I was aware that I was lying down on a hard surface. My sight returned, I would say, hyper-focused, as it zeroed in on the sight before me.  A small rounded cherub-like face, framed with long dark crimpy curls of hair. Still as a pond on a windless summer day. Except for the eyes. They moved all along my mechanical structure, exploring, engaging and disengaging, dilating, as the tiny mind behind the eyes processed the sensory input and studied the thing laid out before it. It's a human child, of nearly eight, I would say, kneeling down before me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reach out with my remaining arm and unfurl my hand. Revealing a small under-developed pinecone I must of grabbed from the forest floor when I collapsed. Those same eyes move to the pinecone, just as the earsplitting sound of pitched screaming began. \"They've followed me here!\", the thought slammed to the front of my mind frame at near the speed of light. Crashing through the walls of my digital cortex, headfast to the realization. \"They let me go.\", and they must have watched me the entire way, following along as I searched out what I had been looking for. What they have so desperately been searching for. And now it's over. \"The last visage of humanity resides within this, what is left of me.\", I thought with the crushing sadness of a dying world. Whatever it is I am. And now, \"I'm dying.\", I think I'm dying..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, I have made my way through this maze of a complex, and I have found myself at the heart of it. I've locked myself down, inside the power plant, the nuclear-powered core at the very center of this gargantuan abomination. And I've sent the whole site, this whole place, this hellhole into meltdown. And in about sixty seconds, I will have sent this whole damned place back to the Devils dooryard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost script, please, tell my family, \"I love them. And I'm sorry.\"..",

        "text": "-Hi! I welcome you to our establishment. Before you get in, it is my duty to give you this note. YOU MUST KEEP IT WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES, NO MATTER WHAT. Things here are a little bit… uncommon, so to ensure your safety and a nice experience, we recommend you to read in detail the paper I delivered to you. This contains rules you have to follow. Please, don't ignore them.\n\n\n-With these words, was how I was received in this supermarket. I am currently vacationing in a small town, a ridiculously small number of inhabitants live here. Everything was pretty normal, until I decided to come here to, basically, get all the necessary things to stay alive during my time here. \n\n\nWhen I heard those words coming out of the mouth of that employee, I was struggling to comprehend what he meant. I couldn't imagine any similar situation happening anywhere else in the world. Perhaps, being a place with only a few people, they prefer to keep safe with rules to avoid thiefs, or problems in general. Whatever, I would buy what I needed and I simply would get outta here to enjoy my trip. \n\n\n\nI took a cart, and I noticed an uncomfortable calm around the place. An absolute silence. There wasn´t more noise than the inevitable people's movements. This intrigued me enough to read the paper, which I had decided to ignore despite the employee´s alert.\n\n\nIt dictated:\n\n\n°1: Do not interact with any client, avoid them at all costs. Each person here has to follow the rules as you do, so they will neither disturb you.\n\n\n°2: If a person wants to exchange words with you, ignore them. If they insist, communicate the problem to one of our security guards. You can easily distinguish them among the clients by their uniform: cap, shirt, trousers and boots. Any person missing one of these clothes IS NOT PART OF OUR STAFF. Once you have done this, walk the farthest you can and do not look behind.\n\n\n°3: If  you are the one breaking the rule, beg so that person does not call the guard. As soon as you realize you have broken the rule, get away from the hearer immediately. \n\n\n°4: Speakers are going to be the only thing you will listen to here. These, communicate typical information, such as lost kids or particular situations in some areas. Feel free to ignore it. If anytime, a countdown of 2 minutes starts, search for an excellent hideout. Believe me, you do not want to be found. Ignore anything you hear, anything you see, you MUST be there for another 2 minutes. Once the time has passed, you can continue shopping. \n\n\n°5: This rule is unlikely to occur, but you better keep always alert. If the speakers start saying your name, close your eyes, cover your ears and wait 30 seconds. If they have not stopped, find a guard to accompany you to the place you are being called from. Now, you must be totally focused. If the guard is taking you to the office next to the entry, tell him that it is not your turn to get in yet. The guard will let you go. On the other hand, if the guard seems to go upstairs, you are dead. Run, search the closest exit and luckily you will manage to escape. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RULE 12.\n\n\n°6: Accidents can happen. If a product breaks or its content made a mess, communicate it to the janitor. He is not always in the same place, but do not ignore the situation. Find him, and tell him about a 04 code, but not where. Get the farthest you can from the zone of the accident. \n\n\n°7: The janitor is always carrying with him a bucket full of water and a mop. If you find him without these things, maybe it is better for you to keep what happened in secret. \n\n\n°8: There are some products which you clearly have not ever seen before, products which stand out for being things that humans would not consume. Do not take them out of their place, do not touch them, and for God's sake do not buy them, they are not for you. If you are seen with any of these in your hands, you will be thought to be with them. If you break this rule, there is nothing we can do for you.\n\n\n°9: If you want to know any product´s price, you can reach one of our screens, which include a code bar reader. It is probable that when you are scanning a product some… particular images appear on the screen. Stare at them until they disappear. They will try to distract you, but you must be strong.\n\n\n°10: Security cameras are only located among the hallways. If you see one anywhere else, tell the guard that they are seeing too much. He will understand, and solve the issue. Do not look at the camera for a long time. You have to be really sure about this rule. The guard hates wasting his time, so think it carefully.\n\n\n°11: To pay for your products, we only have 12 cash registers working, which are put in order. If you see any of it with a different number, or a number which is not in order, do not get through that one.\n\n\n°12: YOU MUST GIVE THIS PAPER BACK TO THE GUARDS NEXT TO THE EXIT DOOR. They will not remind you of it, this rule is entirely your responsibility. If you break this rule, you may have some unexpected visitors at home. If you had to follow rule 5, just make sure that at least the paper is inside this building when you leave.\n\n\nPlease, do not make things difficult neither for you nor our clients and follow every step carefully, everything will be alright. We hope you have the best possible experience.\n\n\n-  I was aghast… What the heck did I just read? I stopped looking at the paper just to find out that I was alone. I couldn't get where would have people gone until my brain decided to pay attention to was I was listening through the speakers:\n\n8… 7… 6… 5… 4… 3… Shit.",

But as I was talking to said “friends” one of them points behind me and yells “watch out” I quickly turn around once his warning reminds me my little brother was with us, but I’m too late and I can only watch as he’s hit by an oncoming vehicle does three consecutive diagonal backflips before landing on the pavement and proceeds to slide 15ft face-first down the street the trail of blood not consistent, revealing the old crack infested pavement overdo for a remodel. I stand on the sidewalk frozen with fear, my eyes flicking back and forth between my brother lying in the middle of the road and the large patch of his face forcefully pealed of like a banana by the pavement. In disbelief I keep repeating “why isn’t he moving?” Over and over, speaking louder each time. It isn’t until I snap out of my fit of terror that I’m able to see what’s actually happening… my cheerful little brother, my favorite person in the whole world is being absorbed into the pavement. I turn around after his body is no longer visible, my “friends” are gone, the person in the car that hit my brother also gone but the car is still present, the birds in the air and the waving tree branches frozen. I can’t even process what’s going on before everything fades to black and Binary code is sprawled out in the black void surrounding me. Then I’m swiftly hit on the head by a heavy metal object. Right before I loose consciousness a familiar voice is speaking, it’s my mother? The only words a can make out are “test results: successful, resetting test subject memory.” I wake up on the living room couch the first thing I see is a prompt on the TV asking if I’m still watching, I head into the kitchen where I see a woman making pancakes. She turns around after hearing my footsteps, she says my name then follows up with “look honey I’m making your favorite.” How does this lady know that I can’t help but think. I can’t see her eyes as they’re blacked out but she has a beautiful smile, so I take a guess and ask “mom?” Her reply is asking what’s wrong and that I look confused, her eyes are no longer blacked out I can now make out her whole face. I recall all sorts of memories with This woman who calls herself my mother, but now there’s a strong sense something important is missing. So I ask my mother if something is missing, she reply’s “no honey, everything important is accounted for” I have a feeling she’s lying.. but then I hear a whisper, “please don’t forget me, big bro!”",

        "text": "Hey!! Read this very carefully, because it is crucial that you heed this information. Things are not the way they seem. I know that is a common trope, but I assure you, you need to listen. I don’t have the time to explain what’s going on. First, lock your doors, and board up your windows. If you don’t have lumber, push heavy objects that cover the glass. If not, quickly, and I mean QUICKLY bring something inside to cover your windows. You do not want anything within your house to be visible, as it will put you at a great risk.\n\nGreat job. Now, I want you to shut off all technology EXCEPT the device you’re using to read this information. Destroy them. You need to limit your electronic presence, because trust me, it will make it easier for them to find you. Destroy and disassemble every electronic device you have, no matter how big. Smash the motherboards. Even if you have a smart stove or fridge, the motherboard MUST be destroyed. Make sure that everything is destroyed, and after that is done, destroy the lights on other floors of your home, if any exist. \n\nFantastic, you’re doing great. You might survive this!! Now, if your house has more than one floor, go upstairs and turn on every sink. Do the same if there are any in the basement. Next you need to know that bullets and knives aren’t effective against these things. In fact, they smell steel and lead. Throw all of these out of your front door, if there are any in your house. This step is absolutely crucial. Otherwise, you may be targeted with much greater ease.\n\nThe next step, is to not answer any calls or texts from anyone. This is extremely dangerous, and will put you at major risks. You must stay inside and avoid anyone and everyone. Please avoid family members, kick them out of the house, do whatever necessary, as you are at a much higher risk if they are nearby. You need them out to survive, they may not be who they seem to be. There is no telling who is a threat, and it is best to isolate yourself.\n\nNow, this is going to be hard. However, if you want to survive, you must do this. If you have any pets, you must kill them. If it’s any consolation, they’re NOT your pets. Your pets have been gone for days. Your pets are them, the threat. Especially if they are larger and can cause damage to you with ease. \n\nNow that you’ve followed this step, I’ll explain what’s going on. There are entities that mimic people, things, and even objects. They are EXTREMELY deceptive, trust me. You cannot defeat them. They are invincible to almost all efforts to stop them and their operations. They will leave soon, however, and to survive, you must wait it out. To defend yourself, I’d recommend, well, actually, you’ve made it much easier for us by leaving your door unlocked. We’re already inside.",

        "text": "Are you reading this? I'm glad you are. It only means one thing: Cardozo has survived and succeeded. Private Colin Valhminsky reporting on Operation Sand Eagle. I don't have much time left, therefore, I will make it as brief as possible but I still have to include all the useful details.\n\nMy team members and I were part of a black or unofficial operation force on a mission in Latin America. Our task: investigate, locate and neutralize a small group of smugglers specializing in the sales of weapons, ranging from firearms to deadly gas, all stolen from our government earlier this year.\n\nOne night, after a successful raid and the capture of four smugglers, we set camp in the desert and prepared for the final strike that had to occur the following day. As the Radio Telephone Operator of the group, RTO for short, I had all communications equipment set right next to my transparent EMF tent to protect myself from all the electromagnetic energy while I sleep.\n\nDuring the darkest hours of the night, I was awakened by a radio transmission. I sat up, unzipped the tent and got ready to respond as soon as the message was fully delivered. However, I quickly noticed that the transmission came from an unknown source as a sick man rambled on about some disturbing stuff:\n\n\"...mere mortals do not comprehend, but the chosen ones will. Our goddess Syhralon nobles intentions transcend the human psyche, so I had to become something more, before I could comprehend, before I could be chosen to wield the Syhralon Claw bestowed to me, the one who performs the sacred ritual of pacification, to prevent her wrath and the extinction of humanity...\"\n\nThe same thing was playing on everyone's radios, since the ones on watch duty all looked at me, and the others resting, exited their tents, radios in hands and also looked at me. Confused, I tried to fight the hack, but nothing could stop the transmission. This is when Spence fired shots at something.\n\nWe all took our firearms, ready to fight what we thought were fellow smugglers trying to free the ones we had captured earlier. Instead, as crazy as it may seem to you, there was only one pale man, dressed with a hooded cloak, wielding a dagger, disappearing and reappearing at will, and teleporting himself across short distances.\n\nHe attacked Spence first, slashing him with the kind of mastery, rapidity and precision that I only remember seeing in ninja or superhero movies. After Spence, he turned to the four prisoners that were still tied up, using the exact same gestures and techniques, he attacked and slaughtered three smugglers but left one unarmed, while we all shot at him to no avail.\n\nThe man teleported himself in front of whoever he chose to slaughter next. Bullets seemed to just go through him without any damage. At some point, I noticed the insects crawling out of the mouths of the corpses he was leaving behind him. The memory of such occurrence struck me like lightning, and I remembered elements from what a friend had told me about the classified 2005 [incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/loaolv/the_voice_of_evil/).\n\nLooking around him helplessly, the only smuggler the murderer did not slaughter earlier had mysteriously freed himself, and was walking backwards, trembling with Spence's rifle between his hands. He seemed unable to see the killer for whatever reason and was walking in the direction of his own demise. Pat and I, the only two soldiers still standing at that moment, screamed at him and gestured him to move away from our shooting range and his own death.\n\nWhen the smuggler's path and the killer's met, Pat and I expected the man to unleash his full cruelty on our prisoner. Instead, the killer just walked through the smuggler like some kind of ghost. I suggested Pat to take shelter in my EMF tent as I had one last plan before that monster gets to us, but Pat had a plan of his own, and refused to follow me.\n\nWhile I ran to my tent, I glimpsed the smuggler running past the killer, as he chose to follow me inside the EMF tent, while Pat launched a grenade towards the mystical entity. We all froze after the explosion, watching the outcome and wishing for the best, only to see the man walk out of the fire unarmed, his clothes not even in flames.\n\nI entered the tent, followed by the prisoner. I saw that man lifting Pat by the neck with one arm and slaughter him taking his time, before he dropped him and started to walk calmly towards the EMF tent. I braced myself, arm in hand, ready to defend myself till my last breath. The killer approached, ready to tear the tent and get to us as he clenched his bloody dagger. I aimed when he was a few meters away from the tent.\n\nHe stabbed the tent and immediately got repelled. He tried a second time and obtained the same result. He tried a third time to no avail. I lowered my weapon and sighed in relief. I guessed right from the elements I could gather from the 2005 incident. That entity, though supernatural, seems to operate on the electromagnetic spectrum, as if he was himself some sort of radio transmission, therefore, he cannot get through a Faraday cage or an EMF tent, that I started bringing with me for almost every mission since I learned about the 2005 incident just in case.\n\nThe killer lowered his dagger and just stood still, staring at me. The smuggler was looking at me and at something outside repeatedly, trembling uncontrollably. I asked him if he was looking forward to die and if he was unable to see that monster. When he saw me talking to him, he shook his head and then tapped his ears with his two hands, still shaking his head to make it clear that he could not understand me. He was deaf.\n\nI found my old mobile phone and tried to take a video of him, but he was invisible to the camera. I think about it now and realize that I could record everything that I wrote, but I guess that I was no longer thinking straight. I then used the text editor to write what you are reading, and also to interact with the smuggler using my average Spanish:\n\n\"Can you see him?\" I typed, before passing him the phone for him to read then type a reply.\n\n\"No.\" He replied. That had to be the reason. He had not heard that bizarre message about a goddess, her chosen ones and some cleansing, therefore, he could not see that man.\n\n\"What is your name?\" I typed.\n\n\"Cardozo\" He replied.\n\n\"There is no escape from this fate. You have been chosen for the pacification. Accept the great honor to be chosen by Syhralon.\" The killer spoke through the communication equipment, still intact next to the tent.\n\n\"Look Cardozo, I have started writing something with this phone. It is everything that happened here. Please keep it with you. Do not show it to others. When you can, find internet and post it everywhere you can. This should not be a secret, everyone has to know.\"\n\n\"How will I go anywhere from here? What about you?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, if you cannot see him, he cannot see you too. You are safe. But all this info has to be recorded and added to what we know from the 2005 incident. As for me, my time is up.\" I replied, knowing exactly what was about to unfold.\n\nPat was only trying to survive, but the grenade, the explosion, the fire and the smoke alerted the other smugglers. I can hear them coming at full speed as I type these final words. They will come and get us out of the tent and in doing so, the killer will reap me apart. They will then all know the same fate after hearing the voice of evil, unless they are deaf like Cardozo, the only way I know to escape the killer.\n\nI can see him smiling under his hood. The fire burning behind him validates the hell he must be coming from. His pale skin seems either covered with black veins or rather with black cracks, all converging towards his entirely black eyes, void of any emotion. The black blood that flowed from his slit open throat and stained his cloak as well as the medieval uniform underneath, reaffirmed his evil origins.\n\nTo Sarah my love, to Stacy and Hailey my precious flowers, I will always love you. To everyone out there, please, stay safe.",

        "text": "As a disclaimer, if after reading the title you have no clue what I’m talking about, I’m sorry to say, but this post isn’t for you. You can go ahead and read it if you want, there’s nothing I can do to stop you, but you’re not going to gain anything from this. \n\nIf you know what I'm talking about after reading the title, then I guess you’re who I’m looking for. With that in mind I’ll ask again, have you noticed the faceless people recently?\n\nIf you answered yes then I’m glad to hear that. It means I’m no longer the only one. \n\nIf you’re like me I don’t know how much help I’ll actually be to you, but I will share what I know. I should probably start off by saying I have no idea where they came from or how long they’ve been here. Personally, I’ve only spotted them recently. For all I know that’s when they first popped up. If you have any more information on that topic specifically please let me know. \n\nNow on to my story.\n\nIt was earlier this month when I spotted one for the first time. I was out Christmas shopping with my mom. We were casually walking through the mall, browsing through the various stores, when I caught my first glimpse of one. It walked out of a store by itself, glanced quickly over at the crowd me and my mom were walking in, then turned the other way and took off. In that brief moment it turned its head I managed to catch a glimpse. I wasn’t sure what I had just seen. Nobody around me had any sort of reaction, at least from what I could tell, so I assumed I was mistaken. I had simply seen things wrong, and as the man disappeared into the crowd ahead, I soon lost track of him. From behind he looked like nothing more than a bald man.\n\nAfter about an hour of mindless strolling, we made for the food court. We grabbed lunch and a seat at an open table. I ate my burger pretty quickly and proceeded to mindlessly look around as I sipped on my soda. That’s when I saw him again. It looked to be the same guy as far as I could tell, and he was walking away from burger king with his tray. This time there was no mistaking it, the guy just didn’t have a face. If you’ve ever seen one of those wooden drawing mannequins then you'll know what I'm talking about. Instead of the clearly defined features of a nose, browline, mouth, and eyes, all that was there was smooth semi-round flesh. \n\nI sorta jolted up right when I spotted him again but it took a minute for my brain to process what I was seeing. From the neck down he was completely normal, dressed in a green jacket, a Metallica shirt, and jeans, but his face was gone. I couldn’t help myself from watching as he set down his tray and took a seat. From what I could tell he wasn’t aware that I was staring at him. If anything I was more intrigued at the time than freaked out. People have faces, it’s a defining characteristic of, well, people. We’re so accustomed to them that we find them in things whenever we can. Not seeing one where you expect one to be honestly creeped me out, that said, I just assumed it was a mask or something. Maybe some weird take on modern art about the perception of others or you know something else artsy. I didn’t know what it was I was looking at but I didn’t jump to anything insane. \n\nGenuinely perplexed by what I was seeing I looked around to see how everyone else was reacting to the guy, but to my surprise, nobody paid him any mind. Everyone around me was either eating, talking, or scrolling on their phones. Even the other people watchers didn’t seem to find the guy strange. No one whispered or pointed. It was like everyone simply ignored him. If anything it was more the lack of attention he was getting that struck me as strange. That was the oddest thing about the masked man. Nobody cared, as if they didn’t even notice him. \n\nThe feeling I felt here I can only compare to what it must feel like to spot a unicorn in a herd of horses and being the only one to notice. Not really being able to take it, I grabbed my mother's attention. \n\n“Hey mom, check out that guy’s face.” I said as hushed as I could and signaled with a point of my thumb.\n\nShe took a quick look and then glared at me. All she said was. “You know better than to make fun of others.” \n\nI looked back at her confused and this time a little louder said. “But mom, his face, its-”\n\n“Timothy Richard Scott! That’s enough!” Her chair screeched as she stood and looked down at me, clearly irritated. “Since you're done, clean this up and meet me by the bookstore.”\n\nShe grabbed her purse and proceeded to head out of the food court, not paying any mind to the faceless man. She wasn’t the only one though, her outburst had caught the attention of everyone around us. I heard muffled laughter from those nearby and wiped the shocked look from my face wanting nothing more than to get out of there. I scraped everything onto the tray as fast as I could trying my best to keep my head down. When I was done I gave a quick look around to see if anyone was still watching me. Most people had gone back to whatever they were doing prior but I noticed the faceless man looking over. On instinct, I looked away, threw out the food, and rushed from the food court. There was something about his empty face looking at me that unnerved me. Oddly enough, when I looked over, it looked like he hadn’t touched his food once. All he did was sit there wearing that strange mask. It was likely just in my head, but I thought I could feel his gaze linger on me as I walked away. \n\nWhen I returned to my mom I could tell she was slightly irritated with me. She didn’t say anything directly, but her demeanor was off. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why though. I didn’t do anything wrong. If anything it was her reaction that was over the top. I mean sure, It was a strange mask, but scolding me for merely pointing it out wasn’t exactly fair. The thing is, I had learned the hard way one too many times that talking to her when she gets like that can be a risky move. I still wanted to talk about how weird it was, the masked man, but decided I’d wait until she had calmed down a little.\n\nWe stopped at one or two more stores before exiting the mall. When we left the snow had started coming down fairly hard and we wasted no time getting out of there. After about ten minutes of listening to some random pop station on the radio, I figured I’d bring up what happened. She seemed calm now and was even humming along to whatever was playing at the time. I turned down the music which caught her attention. \n\n“Ummm, so about that guy in the food court?” \n\n“Here we go again. Why do you insist on making fun of that poor man?” \n\n“What? I’m not. I just found it odd that nobody noticed how he looked.” \n\n“Seriously That's enough. You should be ashamed of yourself. I really thought your father and I did better. He’ll be hearing about this by the way.”\n\nAfter that, she cranked the music back up and we drove without speaking another word to each other. This continued even after we arrived back home. My mom grabbed her bags and sped walked into the house, slamming the door behind her and leaving me standing in the snow. I had no clue what her problem was. It wasn’t like he had a physical disability or anything wrong with him. All he was was some guy in a mask, yet she acted like I was making fun of him for something out of his control. I entered the house and found she was nowhere to be seen. It was probably better that way. Now I was irritated with her probably as much as she was with me. Kicking off my boots I walked up to my bedroom in the hopes of blowing off some steam.\n\nWhen I entered my room I shot off a quick text to a friend explaining the situation briefly and then distracted myself. For the next few hours, I listened to music and played games from my bean bag. My phone went off once with a text calling my mom a bitch and asking if I took a picture of the guy. Honestly, I didn’t want to care anymore. The whole thing had been nothing more than a headache. So I decided I’d get back to that later and focused on my game instead. \n\nAround seven I received a knock on my door from my sister informing me it was time for dinner. Like usual we all sat around the table mostly listening to my dad complain about work. Something something coworker this, something something jackass boss that. The conversation then shifted to my sister who informed us she had got an A on her test and asked if she could have her friends over for the weekend. I sat there silently, intentionally keeping my head down, hoping to avoid any potential arguments about my “rude” behavior. I could tell these plans instantly were about to come crashing down when the conversation fell to my mother, who skipped over the lovely day we’d spent shopping and jumped right to my poor behavior. Informing my dad I had made fun of some poor guy for how he looked. Instantly I could tell he was irritated with me even before he opened his mouth.\n\n“Now why the hell would you think it was acceptable to make fun of a stranger like that?”\n\n“I wasn’t making fun of him. I just thought he was odd. I thought the whole situation was weird. What do you want from me?”\n\n“Yeah well, you’re not five anymore. You know better than to do that.”\n\n“If you would have seen him, you would have done the exact same thing. I have no clue why this is such a big deal!”\n\n“How dare you!? your father would not have pointed at a man for being disfigured like that!” \n\n“Disfigured? What are you even talking about? It wasn’t even real! The guy was wearing a mask!”\n\n“You can’t be serious.”\n\n“You thought that was real? He didn't have a face.”\n\n“What on earth are you talking about? The man had been horribly disfigured.”\n\n“Mom, it was a mask! There was nothing there!”\n\n“Stop! Both of you! My day’s already been long enough.” My dad groaned heavily while he rubbed his temples. “Beth, just tell me what happened.” \n\n“Like I said we were sitting in the food court when your son decided to point out this poor man sitting all by himself. His face had been brutally scarred. I can’t even imagine what he must have gone through to end up like that.” She shifted her eyes back to me. “And he seemed to think the whole thing was funny.”\n\nMy dad went to speak but I cut him off before he could. “Who are you even talking about!? There was no scarred man! Just some creep wearing a mask that made him look like he didn’t have a face.” \n\n“The man in the green jacket who you so thoughtlessly pointed out.”\n\n“That’s bullshit and you know it!”\n\n“That’s enough!” There was a pause as my dad considered what to say next. “Go to your room. You’re done here.”\n\n“But dad I’m not lying.”\n\n“I said that’s enough.”\n\n“Fine. Whatever.”\n\nI left the table not really knowing what just happened. All I could think was how did she not see him? He stuck out, to say the least. Then a thought hit. Was I the only one who saw him? Did nobody else draw attention to the man because they didn’t notice him? That was insane. How was that even possible? A worse question that I found roaming through my mind as I fell onto my bed was could it be possible I had simply imagined the entire thing? That the reason nobody noticed the peculiar man in the mask was because he didn’t look like that to everyone else. With my anger fading my emotions shifted more and more towards confusion and self doubt. It didn't feel possible for me to be the only one. \n\nI picked up my phone and saw the message from my friend still waiting for my reply. I informed him that no, I had not taken a picture of the man and that the entire situation led to a massive fight with both my parents. Which I then recapped for him, with admittedly less detail than I’ve included here. His response. \n\n“You might just be crazy man.”\n\nNot the comforting reply I was hoping for. My parents were both working the next day and my sister would be at school, while I was enjoying a few days off with next to no exams that year. I didn’t want to accept that I might have hallucinated the entire thing. I didn’t really like the implications of that, but laying there I had nothing to say otherwise. On a whim I found myself on Google, searching the words “Faceless man.”. Aside from a few interesting images, there was nothing. I then tried “Faceless man at mall.” and got the same results. No news articles. No videos. Nothing at all about the guy. As things stood I really had just made an ass of myself. \n\nAs I fell asleep that night I decided I’d apologize to my parents when I saw them after they got home. My anger was completely gone at that point and I felt more like an idiot than anything else. I woke up around 9 the next day and after getting some breakfast and taking a hot shower I figured I’d venture out into the world outside to take the dog for a walk. The man was still on my mind but I figured it was best to distract myself. Slapping the leash on him we did just that. \n\nSince its start the previous day the snow had hardly let up for a minute. While previously coating everything it seemed to have decided it wasn't ready to be forgotten. Snow banks now began to rise high like white barriers separating the road from the sidewalk. Hitch didn’t seem to mind this one bit taking the opportunity before him to pounce through every bit of snow he could. We got him a few years back and no matter what he always knew how to cheer me up. Just watching how excited he’d get while we were out never failed to put a smile on my face. He’d frolic through the snow around us then jump back on the sidewalk, run up ahead a little, then look back and wait for me. Rinse and repeat. Every once and a while, whenever I found myself lost in thought, he’d wait for me to catch up with him, then rub up against me. To that, I’d scratch him behind the ears and thank him. \n\nEventually, we made our way to the park, which to my surprise had more people than I was expecting for 11 am on a Wednesday. I assumed they were likely enjoying their holidays like I was. Dog walkers passed by and we’d make small talk as our dogs sniffed one another before going our separate ways. As we were passing by the lake I heard two kids excitedly pointing out to us. They ran over and asked if they could pet Hitch as their worried mother hurried behind them. She apologized and I told her it was no problem. My little guy ate up their attention rolling onto his back and I could tell we’d be there until the mom pulled her kids away. After they got their fill they left. We continued with our lap around the area, with Hitch still running through the snow and eventually finding a stick he seemed to plan on taking home with us. After about an hour though we finally made for the exit. \n\nAs we neared the edge of the park I mindlessly found myself distracted by a cardinal sitting atop a branch, when all of the sudden I was pulled backwards. The leash had tightened and stretched to its limit. First went my arm then my body followed as I was thrown back slipping on the snow. Once steadied I looked back to see that Hitch had stopped. I gave him a slight tug but he wouldn’t budge. He stood solid, refusing to move an inch forward. I approached him and noticed all the hairs on the back of his neck were standing. I took a knee and gave him a pet, asking what was wrong like I’d get an answer. Now Hitch isn’t too big of a dog and more importantly, he’s friendly as all hell. Anything willing or otherwise he will try and play with, be it people, dogs, raccoons, the occasional unlucky skunk, or even just flowers blowing in the wind. He was not an aggressive dog by any means. So seeing him hunch down with his teeth starting to slip out from his mouth worried me. After a few more tugs of his leash it was obvious he wasn’t taking another step forward, and when I looked ahead, it became perfectly clear why as I felt my stomach drop.\n\nJust down the winding path, about twenty feet or so sat an old lady on a bench. She looked slightly frail from what I could tell wrapped up in her bundle of winter clothes. I’d say she looked like a sweet old lady, and I’d say she looked almost peaceful sitting there watching the birds, but both those statements would be lies. Beneath her neatly knitted hat was nothing. No wrinkles, no eyebrows, no cheekbones. The old woman's face was missing. Round like the side of a baseball, but with a texture that appeared to be as smooth as an egg. An egg oddly enough describes the featureless lump of flesh that I saw perfectly. \n\nMy mind began to spin at the sight of her. I felt oddly dizzy and my breath fell out of me in shaky waves. On instinct, I wanted to run, but I feared any sudden movement might call her eyeless attention towards me. The thought of one of these things looking at me again made me feel sick. I shut my eyes and held them closed for a moment, hoping all I would see was a normal old lady once I opened them. A lady with grandkids. One with years of stories to tell. One with a face. When I opened them and was greeted with what I had already seen I felt like my sanity was slowly slipping. I soon realized that very much might be the case.\n\nJust ahead of her a young couple walked. Maybe in their early twenties and home for the holidays. They held hands smiling and talking with one another. The world slowed down for a moment as they passed the faceless woman. The couple's eyes met the expressionless face. I heard voices drift down the path as they spoke. Quick and simple hellos and how are yous were exchanged. She spoke without a mouth and heard without ears. The couple laughed and the old lady nodded her head before they said goodbye and walked their separate ways. \n\nThey could see her. They acknowledged her. Unlike the man, she wasn’t ignored. Only I could see what was missing. I didn’t know what was worse. Seeing something everyone else was ignoring, or being able to see something everyone else couldn’t. I felt almost like I could cry. Two days prior I had been sane but now I clearly must have lost my mind. Even if it was just a mask, why wasn’t anyone addressing it? I stood there maybe fifteen, twenty feet, down the path clutched in the tight grip of fear. \n\nThen Hitch growled. \n\nHis sudden recognition of danger instantly snapped me out of it and brought all my attention to him. Hitch was looking directly at the faceless woman. He acknowledged what I was seeing, but not only that he saw it as a threat. The most friendly dog in the world looked ready to attack if needed. I say if needed because from what I could tell he was in full protection mode, not wanting us or her to get any closer. I wasn’t crazy. At least that was my first thought. I didn’t know what else to think but something told me we needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. I didn’t want that faceless thing's attention. When the faceless man in the mall looked at me it sent a shiver down my spine. At the time I merely thought it was because of my brain's reaction to seeing the absence of something in a spot you’d normally expect to see a face. Instinctively it unnerved me, but now with a dog just as bothered by what I was seeing, I dreaded having her eyeless face look upon me.\n\nHitch didn’t seem to be on the same page as me because before I could make a move he barked. It was loud and aggressive. The instant he did it I saw birds jump from nearby trees and the heads of the couple lock onto us. It was a kind of bark I had never heard come out of him before. In a panic, I yelled his name and turned to head back the way we came. With all my strength I pulled back on the leash and finally he gave in. We took off quickly but the moment my back was to her I could feel her attention. Out of instinct, I turned to look back as we fled. Sure enough, she was looking right at us. The sensation of someone watching me didn’t leave until we were far out of sight. Maybe I was just being paranoid but for the rest of our walk, my head was on a constant pivot. I kept an eye on everyone around us endlessly waiting to see her again. Hitch seemed to be in the same boat. He didn’t leave my side for the rest of the walk and every couple of minutes I’d see him watching our backs. We made it home without encountering her or any other of the faceless. \n\nOver the next few days, the sightings didn’t let up. Throughout the day I’d see them walking down the street from my bedroom window. Notice them while out shopping. They were everywhere. Never more than one or two at a time, but no matter where I went I’d end up seeing them. It was almost like it was spreading. I remember one night we’d just finished dinner and dad went to watch the news in the living room. As I was headed up to my room I looked in and saw one of the anchors had become one of these things. Across the internet, I started to see them, but nobody ever said a thing. I spent hours searching but couldn’t even find a passing comment. I noticed one day that a YouTuber I was watching had become one of these things. All of his old videos were fine, you could see his face perfectly, but in his most recent uploads, it was gone. I tried sending one to a friend and simply asked if he could spot anything wrong with the video, which he failed to do. Hitch had also been getting worked up every day, slowly growing more aggressive. I have yet to see any of these things walk a dog, and with everything with Hitch, I’m under the belief they can spot them as well. \n\nEverything came to a head on Christmas eve. The night prior my parents had gone out to a party. They spent the night and I didn’t think too much about it. The next morning I woke up to Hitch losing his mind. I rushed downstairs and could see him at the back door. He was practically frothing at the mouth, barking like all hell and pawing at the door. This instantly put me on edge. I looked out there but our yard was free of any of the faceless. Same for the neighbors. I heard my mom's voice in the kitchen and rushed in asking what was going on. She told me she didn’t know. She said when she and my dad got home he freaked out and so my dad grabbed him and tossed him outside. I could see him through the kitchen window. He’d stopped barking but was now pacing in front of the door. I’ve never seen a dog look so anxious before, at least not like that. I figured my dad might have more information and went to the living room to find him. He sat in his favorite chair reading a newspaper. He held it high, covering his face. The moment I stepped into the room I couldn’t help but feel like something was off. \n\n“Hey, dad.” My words came out meek and timid.\n\n“Hey, son.” His voice almost sounded deeper than usual, and I felt like it echoed in my head.\n\n“Umm, what’s going on with Hitch? Why’s he freaking out?”\n\n“Damn dog must have lost its mind. He’s been acting strange recently hasn’t he?”\n\n“I guess so.” \n\nInstantly I feared the worst. Instinct told me to run but my legs wouldn’t move. It was the worst form of morbid curiosity. The kind where all you hope is to be proven wrong. I needed that. So carefully I walked towards his chair, circling around the room. As I walked I watched his body twist to follow me. He matched my pace without looking. Like he knew where I was at all times. His arms stayed still, holding the newspaper perfectly in place, but his torso twisted at his waist. Inch by inch my father’s face was revealed. The lack of a right ear. Smooth almost soft looking skin. A bald scalp replaced his once receding hairline. When I finally made my way around the newspaper I was greeted by a man who was not my father. Everything was so close except for his face. My body began shivering as I held back the overwhelming sensation to fall to my knees and cry. \n\n“What’s wrong son?” The faceless creature said without a mouth.\n\n“Just worried about the dog.” I said as my world shattered. “How was your night?”\n\n“Absolutely perfect, but I’m glad to be home with my family now.”\n\nI stumbled out of the living room in a daze and returned to my bedroom. I didn’t have any clue why this was happening, why I was seeing these things. I still don’t. All I knew is that my father had become one and there was nothing I could do about it. No one would believe me. As far as I know, I’m the only one who can see these things. For the rest of the day, I sat in my room in silence, jumping at every noise throughout the house. Hitch barked periodically. Every now and then I could hear him scratching at the door below. I thought about running away. My mother would never listen to me. My sister might but where were we supposed to go? It’s not like we could just show up at grandma’s house saying “Hey our day has been replaced by a monster” and that’s if I could even convince her. With nowhere to go, feeling powerless, I waited. When dinner eventually came I made my way downstairs and took a seat at the table. I kept my head down and said very little throughout dinner. It made me sick to see this thing talking to my mom and sister like it was part of the family. Laughing and joking like none of us knew it was a monster. Whenever my eyes did leave my plate I’d see it looking at me. Its grotesque face always staring at me. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get that sight out of my head.\n\nAfter dinner, I returned to my bedroom and locked my door. I sat late into the night listening to Hitch bark and whine from the back door. Around 2 am I heard a door creak open. After a moment faintly I heard someone slowly tiptoe down the hallway. At times it was hard to hear. They were so careful. Next, the stairs groaned as someone began their descent. Hitch began freaking out. He barked again and again. Then only for a few brief seconds, it got louder before he let out a loud whimper and fell silent. I sat there watching my door, with my breath held, too scared to swallow or risk making any noise at all. After a minute of nothing but silence I allowed myself to breathe again. After five my body relaxed. And after about ten I almost found enough confidence to open the door and look. I inched closer but froze in my track as the footsteps started once again. They crept their way back up the stairs and slowly walked down the hall. I stayed completely still with my hand hovering around the doorknob as finally they came to a stop on the other side of the door. I did my best to stop myself from shaking as I waited for the creature to come crashing through. The knob twisted but the door remained closed. Then to my surprise came three gentle knocks.  \n\n“I know. You’re awake in there. Listening. You know the truth. You’ve seen us. Can spot us. I know.” There was a long moment of silence then it spoke again. “We don’t like you.”\n\nI didn’t respond, I didn’t move, I didn’t even breathe, I simply stared at the door. After a moment I heard it shuffle off down the hall and return to my parent's bedroom. I don’t know how long I stayed standing there, still frozen, but after the house gave into a permanent silence I returned to my bed. Day eventually came and with the sun’s rise my body could no longer stay awake and I succumbed to sleep. When I awoke it was already dark outside. Initially, I refused to leave my room, but the thought of my mother and sister stuck out there with that thing stirred something inside of me. I didn’t care anymore. I had to do something. Even if they couldn’t see it I needed to protect them. With dad gone it was my job. I had to do something before it was too late. Mustering up every bit of strength I had, I unlocked my door. Stepping into the hall I was greeted by nothing but darkness at first. Turning my head to the stairs I saw a faint glow. Following the light, I eventually came to a stop just before the dining room. The glow wasn’t consistent, it seemed to flicker and dance periodically while the rest of the house behind me stayed dark. With a deep breath, I turned the corner.\n\nSitting straight ahead was the thing pretending to be my father. The table before him was decorated in the finest Christmas display. Four of our family's best plates waited in front of each chair tucked between silverware with a wine glass in front. Two candelabra stood around a large cut of ham. Every inch of the table was littered with plates of food ready to be served. A wonderful assortment consisting of Stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, green beans, etcetera. Below lay a green and red tablecloth. Patiently sitting in her seat to the right of the table was my sister. Her empty vacant face stared up at me. Behind her, my mother entered the room from the kitchen carrying a bottle of wine. Much like my sister, her face was gone as well.\n\n“You’ve come to join us. Finally. I knew you’d come around eventually.” My faceless mother said. \n\n“Smart choice. We were worried we’d have to come and get you ourselves. Now sit.” Said my faceless father.\n\n“Do we get to eat now?” My former sister said, looking up at my mother as she made her way to the table.\n\n“Shortly dear.”\n\nThey all looked at me. Waiting. So doing as I was told I took my usual seat across from my sister. My mother placed the bottle next to one of the candles and took her seat to my right, across from my father. The weight of the situation hit me as I sat, surrounded by bodies resembling my family, each one missing their face. I had no clue why they felt the need to pretend. They knew I could see.\n\n“Dig in son.”\n\n“I’m hungry, I want to eat now.” My faceless sister said. \n\n“Patience. I know you’re hungry but you’ll have to wait a little longer.” The one pretending to be my mom said. She reached over and placed a hand over hers.\n\n“When will he be joining us?”\n\n“Soon dear.”\n\nWith all of them staring at me, I gave in. Leaning forward I took servings of every item before me. I was too late to save them. I should have done something sooner, but instead, I locked myself away in my room and now there was no going back. Whatever had taken the place of my father had replaced them, be it literally or by changing them into whatever he was now. I didn’t know if there was any point in fighting them. They knew I could see them but this felt like some sort of cruel game. Sitting pretending to be a family like everything was normal. I hated it. Tears welled up in my eyes as I cut into the ham. My fingers tightened around the knife as it slowly sliced the meat in two. \n\nEach one of them stared at me with their blank faces waiting for me to take a bite as I brought the cut of ham up to my mouth. Tears now rolled freely down my face as I did so. I swallowed slowly then complimented the food. They gave no reaction. With a false smile, I looked from right to left at each of them landing on my father. I closed my eyes for a brief second, then with a sniffle, I opened them back up.\n\nMoving as fast as I could I twisted the knife in my hand and without a second thought lunged toward my father. His reaction was just as quick as he raised his hand to catch the blade. The knife shot straight through and out the other side. The thing didn’t even flinch. Instead, with his other hand, he grabbed me by the hair before I could react. With a hard shove, he brought my head down onto the table below. My head shattered his plate upon impact as the whole table shook, tossing cutlery and knocking over wine glasses. He lifted my head back up and slammed me down once again. Still not satisfied, he repeated this act again and again. Each time sent a shock wave of pain through my head. When he lifted me for the second time, I caught a glimpse of my mother and sister sitting back and watching without a single care. On the third hit, I heard the table crack and on the fourth, when I looked down, I could see blood. The world spun and my vision grew blurry but I needed to do something. In my last hope to save myself, I reached for one of the shards of plate still remaining on the table after my head hit for the fifth time. Quickly I latched onto it and as I was raised up once again I swung. It wasn’t much but the tip of the shard slid across his face cutting it open.\n\nHe clutched at the wound, shrieking horribly, and I fell to the ground. With my head aching, I wanted to rest but knew if I hesitated it was likely over for me. The faceless stumbled backwards and I grabbed a fork up off the ground. Pushing myself up I charged at him as he stumbled, behind me hearing chairs slide backwards. I threw myself at him once more, wrapping my arms around his waist and taking him to the ground. When we hit his head it let out a loud smack. I thought it almost sounded damp, like a wet towel being swung against a wall. With no time to spare I vaulted myself towards his head, raising the fork into the air before dropping my arm with all my might. With little to no resistance, it stabbed through his flesh. Bits of blood shot out like a burst pimple then oozed down his face. I didn’t let up though and repeated this four more times before a hand wrapped around my shoulder. It clamped down and I heard something in my arm snap. I felt like little more than a rag doll as I was effortlessly tossed back. I cried out as I crashed into the ground shoulder first. Now standing above me, towering over, was my faceless mother.\n\nShe went to rush me but I delivered a swift kick to her kneecap, tripping her in the process. I scrambled to my feet and made a break for the door. Swinging it open I went to move but a hand slammed it shut. She had recovered just as quickly as she had gone down and had now caught up with me. Before I could make my next move her hand was wrapped around my throat. As she raised me into the air I felt the tips of her fingers ever so slightly push through the skin around my neck. Like a desperate animal, I began clawing and kicking at her. Nothing I did seemed to have any effect until finally, my nails caught on her skin. The texture, while similar to skin, almost reminded me of leather. I yanked my hand down hard, tearing through her flesh. Her grip loosened and I raised my leg and planted my foot into the center of her chest. She dropped me and with the front exit blocked I turned and made for the back door. Standing in front of it my father already waited, the edges of his body highlighted by the faint glow of the moon. Stumbling slightly I turned to my left and entered the kitchen.\n\nI ran for the counter and grabbed the biggest knife I could find. When I turned back around he was already standing at the exit. In the darkness, it almost looked like his head had deflated slightly. I readied myself and took a cautious step forward which he matched with one of his own. My eyes went wide and I screamed as a blistering pain shot throughout my leg. I collapsed onto my knees and looked down to see my sister. Just like when I had been lifted into the air her fingers had pierced the skin around my calf. Unlike the previous time however it was more than just the fingertips, her’s were buried down to the knuckle. Suddenly the veins in her arm began to glow through her skin. I could feel her fingers twitch inside my leg as the glowing in her arm only grew brighter. With gritted teeth, I looked away while I brought my fist down onto her head. I hit her again and again until I could feel blood on my knuckles. With a jerk of my leg, I was able to pull free. Her fingers slid out of my leg and I rose just in time to see my faceless father standing no more than a foot away. \n\nClasping the knife with both hands I brought it down to my side then drove it forward as I lept towards him. Unlike before I no longer had the element of surprise on my hand and he was ready. He Sidestepped my blade with ease then plunged his fist into my gut. I lost all air immediately. My hands went limp, dropping the knife as I fell to the ground once more. With the wind knocked out of me I desperately gasped for breath. He raised his leg then kicked me in the shoulder sending me onto my back. Crouching down he wrapped both hands around my throat and instantly tightened his grip. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see my faceless mother approaching from the dining room. \n\n“Careful. He’ll be useless pretty soon.”\n\n“Not like this.”\n\nShe left my sight but I heard her feet come to a stop where I had left my sister. “I know it's tempting but told you we’d eat later.”\n\nIt didn’t take long before my vision began to blur then start to fade to black. I fumbled through my pocket looking for my last line of defense. Just as I approached the edge of consciousness I managed to find it. A small knife which I had tucked into my pocket as a backup. Pulling my arm out I swung it over his shoulder and through the back of his head. Once it was in there I extended my arm as far as I could, slicing through his skin. His grip stayed tight for a moment, then loosened before he dropped lifelessly on top of me. The mother wailed as I rolled out from under him, covered in the blood from the thing pretending to be my father. I rose to my feet barely able to catch my breath. In what I can only describe as pure rage she lunged towards me but I was able to just barely jump out of the way. Crashing down on my knees for what would be the final time I stood once again, the large steak knife now returned to my hands. She went to turn but was too slow and I plunged the thick blade into her head. \n\nThe screaming stopped quickly after that. She fell and I turned to my faceless sister. I raised the knife but I couldn’t do it. Even if it didn’t have her face, it looked too much like her. With the last of my energy, I was able to grab a hold of her and toss her down into the basement. I could hear her scream and beat against the door but once it was locked she couldn’t do much. I collapsed just behind the door and finally cried. I don’t know how long it went on, but I didn’t stop for what felt like forever. Even after my eyes burned from the tears. \n\nI have little doubt that I most likely have a concussion, I know I should see a doctor but I’m too scared of seeing more of these things. The last thing I want is to be trapped in the same room with one of them again. I’m horrified that the others know and are just waiting to come get me. I don’t know how long I have left. They seem to be everywhere. Around fifty percent of the people I see through the windows are faceless now. I don’t know what to do. \n\nAs far as I know, I am still the only person who can see them. Nowhere online have I found anyone mentioning them. That’s why I’m sharing this with you all. If you can see them two please let me know I’m not alone. I don’t want to be the only one. \n\nIf you’ve read this and you can’t see them I wish you luck. I think you’re really going to need it.",

        "text": "\nTwo days ago , I was chilling with my younger cousin . I'm 13 and hes 7 . For personal reasons , I'll be using our  first name initials . Call me Z and him Q .\n\nSo we're lying on the bed , scrolling through Tiktok when all of a sudden I felt this presence . Like , that feeling you get when someone's watching you and you KNOW it . I look around frantically yet I tried to keep my cool , as to not alarm my cousin . Spotting nothing , I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply . Deep breaths , Z .\n\n\" Oooohhhh ! Z look ! That Mr has a frog face ! \" Beamed Q excitedly . I looked towards my phone , but nothing was related to frogs or yet a frog face . Me  , being as scared as I am retorted rather rudely . \" Q , stop talking nonsense or else we wont watch Tiktok anymore . \" \n\nBeing a 7 year old that hated being told no , he kept on whining , and my fear grew .\n\n\" But Z ! Just look ! Hes by the curtain ! \" He pointed towards the left curtain . I could hear the wind softly brushing against the material , swaying it from side to side .\n\nGiving in to his whining , and pushing myself to be confident , I looked at the curtain , but to my relief , saw nothing . \n\n\" Oh . Hes gone now . \" Q muttered in a sad tone . I brushed it off as an imaginary friend and carried on watching Tiktok .\n\nHowever , Q wasnt one to have imaginary friends . \n\nThe next day I was plagued with the thoughts of this ' Mr FrogFace ' . Was he real ? Was Q hallucinating ? Was there a ghost in our house ? Was there a frog monster who happened to look like a gentleman ? \n\nI couldnt bring myself to answer any of those , but a frog in a top hat is quite an interesting imagery . \n\nI was snapped away from my overthinking by my mother . She asked what's wrong and I explained to her in brief detail on what Q said . She laughed at me and said \" Dont go out of your way to make fun of your cousin , its pathetic \" \n\nPathetic ? You're calling my anxiety PATHETIC ? Pff , for a mother you're pathetic .\n\nAngry , I stormed off to my room , finding Q once again there , staring at the curtain . \n\n\" Q what are you doing ? \" I asked with unease , my body tensed as I looked at the boy . He turned around , a small smile on his face . \" I was just talking to Mr FrogFace ! \" He beamed with such innocence of a child , the sun baby from Teletubbies would be absolutely jealous .  \n\n\" Q....Mr FrogFace isnt real . \" i said sternly , my anxiety once kicking in . \n\n\" Yes he is ! Close one of your eyes and you will see him !! \" He pouted and pointed towards the curtain . \n\nGroaning with annoyance , I complied and guess what I saw ?\n\nNothing . \n\n\" Q , stop making things up \" I growled , getting fed up wih his nonsense .\n\n\" I'm not !! \" He turned around to look at the curtain once more , a soft ' oh ' emitting from his high pitched voice . \n\n\" Z , hes looking at you now ! \" Q looked at me again , hopeful for a more convinced reply . \n\nIn that moment , I saw a slimy black arm-like limb crawl out from underneath the curtain , grabbing Q's foot and dragging him under said curtain .\n\nI watched .\n\nI watched as he screamed .\n\nI watched as the tears streamed down his face .\n\nI....couldnt move . \n\nMy body was as still as a rock . My anxiety was through the roof . My eyes were flooded with hot , salty tears . My brain begged my body to move . My body wouldnt listen .\n\nA loud thud brought my consciousness back , and there he was . Q was lying on the floor , his face had a horrific expression , but ...\n\nWhere was the rest of his body...? \n\nMy breathing quickened and that's when I saw it . It slithered from under the curtain , reaching a height for atleast 9 feet. It's back was arched . It's teeth were bared . It's eyes were glowing in the now dark room . Its face resembled a frog .\n\nA black substance dripped from all parts of its body . Tilting its head , it formed the creepiest grin . A grin intent on murder . It licked its lips , the remaining blood of Q still scattered across his horrifying features as it made eye contact with me .\n\nIt lunged at me , and at that moment I was already aware that I needed to go. NOW . \n\nI ran downstairs as fast as my long legs would take me , bumping into my mother , my aunt next to her . \n\n\" Mom please ! We have to leave now ! Q's dead and t-that THING killed h-him !! \" My words were fumbled , my body was shaking . \n\n\" What the hell ? Calm down , say it slower \" She said firmly , a genuine look of worry on her eyes . \n\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breathe , hearing sounds of struggle and choking not long after .\n\nMr FrogFace was on the staircase , Its elongated limbs grabbing my mother and aunt by their necks . \n\nI watched in horror as It completely devoured their flesh at an uncanny speed , their blood painting the rocky floor a beautiful but menacing red . \n\nI shouted as hard as I could . In that moment i just wanted to curl I'm into a ball and cry...but I couldnt . I had to do something .\n\nWith tears streaming down my face like a waterfall , I rushed out of the door , running as fast as i could . My breathing stopped for a bit and i looked around for any house that seemed to be friendly . \n\nI looked at the familiar white house with black accents adorning many crevices . Of course ! Aunt F was the most wise and supporting person ever ! \n\nI knocked on her door and a familiar face greeted me . I rambled on and on , breaking down as my sobs filled the quiet atmosphere . \n\nShe welcomed me in , holding me tightly . I continued to sob in her arms , my body losing its feeling and my knees going weak . \n\nShe led me to a guest room  and sat me down on the bed , patting my back . \n\n\" I'll check up soon . Please get rest . \"  She whispered and left me alone , closing the door behind her .\n\nI lied sprawled out on the clean bed , looking at the lovely red curtains .\n\nAnd with another thud , Aunt F's head dropped out from under the curtain .",

        "text": " It is a nice summer day. The breeze is amazing, the smell of flowers grazed my nose, looking in the man made pond in my backyard, the trees and I mirrored back, the calm rippling water as the fish swam . . what a nice day for a hike I thought. I check the weather app too incase of any weather changes or weather alerts, my app said there was a 70% chance of light rain, which is fine with me, who doesn't love a little rain? The smell, and the feel. \n\nI live in a area surrounded by trees and nature, it is honestly such a beautiful land for living, I know the area like the back of my hand we have a set of 2 trails, a shallow creek that leads you to a beautiful opening in the mountain tops, all tide off with a Do Not Trespass sign so the land is all for me and my family and the animals. Today I made my way to trail 1, trail 1 is about a 10 mile trail all around, it circles around a small neighborhood about 4 miles out. I am familiar with a lot of people around in this neighborhood considering I walk these trails almost every weekend. There is a nice man who lives in a small blue house with a garden in his front lawn. He always waves as I'm passing by while watering his flowers.\n\nBefore I started my hike I picked up a small backpack to take with me. In this backpack I have 3 water bottles, 2 granola bars and a small pocket knife. Starting the trail with a smile on my face I was excited! The weather is perfect. I can see and hear the birds, the squirrels scrambling up the trees shaking the leaves as I pass by, and the sound of the small animals rustling in the bushes trying to hide from me. \n\nAfter a good 22 minutes into my hike I was 1 mile in, I stopped to take a sip of water and to take a short breather, I sat on the small stub that I pass by where a withered tree had used to stand but has now fallen due to a strong thunderstorm we had a few months back. While sitting I see a cute little bunny passing, how cute, how fluffy and fragile I thought, I cracked open my first water bottle with my teeth and fountained it into my mouth but that's when I heard it, a loud blood curdling scream come deep from within the woods the bunny now scared off and me standing up looking around pondered on the thought of what that might be, I can't think of any animals that live in these woods that could make such a sound.. I try to dismiss it as it may be a group of teens who found their way into the woods ignorantly ignoring the no trespassing sign.\n\nContinuing with my hike I was now nearing the neighborhood with the crunch of gravel and leaves under my feet, what a satisfying sound, until it was interrupted with that ear bleeding screech again. God what the fuck could make that noise, It was louder this time. still trying to wrap my head around what that awful noise was I continue through the woods paranoid that's when the rain starts falling. I see something in the corner of my eye, a figure as fast as lightning launching itself through the woods too fast to see and too far gone to be identifiable. maybe it was a fox? Well if it wanted to hurt me it wouldn't be running away from me. . . . right?\n\nAGAIN, that screaming sound, but this time it is near,  right behind me. It hurt. I slipped in the mud and fell to the ground as I held my ears covering them with my hands almost crying lying on the ground letting the rain hit my face. The pain.. FUCK! The pain! My ears now ringing due to that noise like shattering glass, I stood up glancing around even more paranoid than before I then took the time to look down at my hands . . blood. Blood everywhere. My ears are bleeding! and that's when I saw IT or . . well . . them in the corner of my eye, I looked up. Many figures stood in the distance behind trees watching me.\n\nTall, VERY tall, at least 9 feet each, lengthy and skinny, they are the color of a black void and their eyes . . I will never forget their eyes, they are pure white. Staring into them is giving me the most uncomforting unwelcoming feeling. It was like they want me gone, like they want me to get the fuck out. . as if this is THEIR woods and THEIR land. Their arms were long, nearly dragging the ground, their hands were claws . . sharp, oh so very sharp. One of them slowly started dragging their claws on the tree leaving a scratch mark and that awful screaming noise which I now know was coming from them and their unhinged mouths. One started tilting its head slowly while doing so its neck made a cracking sound. Oh. My. Fucking. God. it's neck ..  stretching and growing in length making a breaking and snapping sound it's getting longer and taller.\n\nI had no plans to stay and try to make friends with these ungodly fucking creatures, I just want to get the fuck out. I started to run, I didn't look back. I heard the leaves and plants getting mauled through behind me as if something was chasing me. \"don't look back.\" \"don't look back!\" I repeat to myself, but I'm curious and a idiot, letting my curiosity get the best of me I turned around for a split second and that's when I saw 6 giant beastly creatures charging at me like a wolf pack chasing a small bunny, their claws digging into the dirt launching themselves forwards to get close to me. One of them hooked my shoulder with their claws dragging me down to the ground, I hit my head so hard onto the rock below me I blacked out for a second. While having wip-lash and my instinct for survival I remembered my pocket knife. shit. I forgot my backpack. I look back up and a giant creature pinning me down slowly moving in towards my face with its unhinged jaw drooling over me letting it's awful breath that smells like roadkill fill my nose, this is it I know this is about to be my end, it is about to sink its teeth into me.",

        "text": "I am so sorry if any of this is incoherent, I haven’t slept in days, for reasons you’ll find out. I just need help before I go insane, or something worse happens.\n\nLook, we all dream right? Everyone has them, even if you don’t remember them. You dream every night, you just don’t remember it. At least that’s what Google told me. But I’ve never had a good memory of my own. Vague thoughts or feelings, but nothing concrete. They’d slip through the gaps in my fingers when I woke up, no matter how hard I tried to grasp them. But the dreams I'd always remember were my false awakenings. You know what those are, right? You think you’re awake, you get out of bed to start your day, and BAM you’re back in your bed. But it would always be like… once or twice right?\n\nNot for me.\n\nI’d lose count of how many times I'd wake up, get out of bed, then wake up again. Over and over, growing more and more frantic as I began to lose track of what was real and what wasn’t. Reading texts didn’t help, looking at clocks didn’t help, pinching myself didn’t help. I’d end up screaming and shouting like a damn child, crying for my mom. It was embarrassing. Worst incident was when I had the bright idea to fling myself out of bed. I had one of those high-up beds at the time. Needless to say my parents weren’t happy when they had to drag my sobbing ass to the hospital because I broke my arm. I had to get rid of the bed after that. And move out as soon as I could.\n\nBut that’s like… whatever. That’s not my problem anymore. I fucking wish it was, but it’s not. My current problems started when I went to the local shopping mall because, surprise surprise, I wanted to go shopping. Didn’t know what I wanted, I just wanted to go. God do I regret it. As I made my way through the awkwardly empty halls, lined with shops that still stubbornly remained, I saw it. This new… shack, I guess? Tucked away in the corner of the dead end. Well not a shack- It was made of dark purple cloth, glossy like velvet. A weird tent. And a sign, hand-painted on what looked like a piece of driftwood. ‘Oneirology’. The study of dreams, I found out later. I was bored out of my mind at this point, so I decided fuck it, lets check the weird tent out. Big mistake, obviously. \n\nIt was dark as hell inside, illuminated by cheap fairy lights strung up along the walls and roof. But what captivated me was the weird displays - wooden stands holding glass vials. I could barely see an unidentified liquid inside them; I took one in a nervous hand and saw it was some matte colorful liquid, like someone had swirled different paints together. It certainly swirled like paint too. Yet the colors never mixer together; the reds and blues and yellows all remained distinct. But I had to stop oogling the colors when a sudden hand shot out from the dim, grasping my wrist and wrenching it up and up and I looked up and I was staring face to face with a man. “*Do not touch, unless you are going to buy.*” he said.\n\nAt least, I thought he was a man at the time. I don’t know what I think he is anymore.\n\nBut anyway, I started writhing and babbling like a child, spluttering out as many excuses as I could pull out of my ass, when he just laughed and let me go. “*Relax. You will suffer no harm. Just do not touch the merchandise.*” His voice was smooth, too smooth.  \nPractically robotic.\n\n“I- What. Are you selling-” I squeaked out, finally getting a good look at him.\n\nAwkwardly tall, stooped against the sloping roof of the tent. Clad in all black. But his face… incredibly wide, with a grin to match, and thick eyebrows… he looked familiar, but I couldn’t place it. And his grin somehow widened even further, eyes glinting with… something. “*Dreams,*” he whispered, clasping his hands together, “*If you are interested.*”\n\n“I- What? Dreams?” I laughed then, incredulously. \n\n“*Yes, dreams. Good ones, bad ones. Those who do not want their current dreams can simply just… trade. I do not wish to make assumptions, but you sir, seem to be… interested.*” he leered down at me.\n\nI had to admit… I was. I hated my dreams, hated the drama and panic they caused me, the disapproving looks from my parents who found it all too pathetic that I could react so violently over… dreams. “...What if I was?” I admitted.  \nI never should’ve said anything. The man laughed, and revealed another vial from behind his back. “*Sleep with this under your pillow. When you awaken, bring it back to me. Of course, you can say no, if you so wish. I will not force you.*”  \nI should’ve listened to that warning, I should’ve said no.   \nBut I didn’t.  \nI swallowed the lump in my throat and nodded, taking the vial from the guy. I really shouldn’t have.\n\n...\n\nI listened to the guy, obviously. Stuck the glass under my pillow and went to sleep. I still don’t know why I listened. A vague hope, desire to be rid of my shitty dreams. When I woke up, I noticed I didn’t dream. Like… at all. No memories dancing just out of reach, no fading feelings. Just nothing. And the vial… Well it was full. I couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise at the paint-like liquid swirling around inside it. Unlike the vial I picked up in the shop, the colors in this one were… gross. Dull greens and purples, sludgy browns. I couldn’t help but grimace. But the shop guy did say I should bring it back to him, so I did.  \nHe raised an eyebrow at it, but he didn’t say anything. “*I am glad you cooperated. You are allowed to choose any dream you wish. Just bring it home with you, and drink it. Should you wish to change it, just sleep with the vial beneath your pillow, and bring it back to me.*” his voice sounded almost automated, rattling off words from a script I couldn’t see.\n\n“...Got it.” I mumbled, and passed the vial to him.   \nHis hands were unnaturally cold and clammy, and I flinched. But he said nothing. He just watched with a thin smile as I gazed at the sea of glass. I felt uneasy as his eyes never left me, so I just snatched up the closest one, muttering that I made my choice. I looked at the colors, all blues and purples, cool yet vibrant. “*Excellent choice. Have a nice day sir.*” he grinned, and I got out of there as soon as I could. \n\nI tossed the vial between my hands when I got back to my apartment, regarding the sludge inside with apprehension. I’d just apparently given up my dreams to some complete stranger, and now I was supposed to drink a vial of them? And I did. I know you probably think I’m a complete idiot, and… well fair. At the time I was just so tired, figuratively and literally. Each night going to sleep was a gamble of nothing or trauma, and I couldn’t take it. I was desperate, and so I just… drank the vial. As the contents went down my throat I had the brief thought that the man showed up for me, but I dismissed the thought. The liquid tasted of nothing. I was honestly expecting it to taste like paint but nope, nothing. I guess that was one of the only good things to come from this. I didn’t really know what to do after that point, so after doing nothing all day, I just went to bed, anxiously awaiting what I'd find in my dreams. \n\nIt was utterly nonsensical. It was like it came right out of a TV show- some quest for a mcguffin I couldn’t remember, with people I couldn’t remember. The events were strange and nonsensical; fighting sentient gummy animals in a jungle, suddenly transitioning to a McDonalds’ play place, and ending up in a house I didn’t recognize being cooed over by grandparents that weren’t mine. When I woke up, I felt like I was experiencing the 5 stages of grief. But I REMEMBERED a dream. And it was a GOOD dream. Absolutely nonsensical, but it was GOOD.\n\nThe guy hadn’t been lying to me.\n\nAnd then things went to shit, and it was all my fault. \n\n...\n\nI got bored of the nonsensical dreams after a week. I was never a patient person but I guess that cemented it. They were fun, but they were distracting. They occupied my mind when I should’ve been doing college work, distancing me from my friends whenever they’d ask me what was on my mind. So I went back to the shop. The man running it just smiled, almost like he’d been expecting me. “*You are not satisfied with your dreams, are you?*” he asked, “*Worry not, you may exchange your dreams as many times as you see fit.*”  \nAnd that was it for me.\n\nIt was like a drug, I'll tell you. Being able to swap the kinds of dreams I'd have on a dime. I’d chug a vial, experience someone else’s dreams for a few days, then switch. They were all different. Some were strange and nonsensical, constantly shifting people and characters and locations. Some were more straightforward and almost boring. I always felt a twinge of annoyance when they were boring. I started getting dreams that were more like memories too. People I didn’t know living lives I would never know. Their ups and downs, their losses and achievements. In one dream I was cupping the face of the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen, only for it to shift suddenly, and I was left staring at a flaming wreck of a vehicle, the roar of the rain and wail of sirens in my ears. In another, I was far smaller than I am today, shrieking with delight as a puppy licked at my face. I relished it. I feel disgusted that I did.\n\nAs I did, I also learnt more about the man. Or rather, observed things that, looking back, were concerning, but I was too caught up on the dream-high to care about. His skin looked fake, more like plastic than skin. No grooves or cracks or pores. His mouth would occasionally hold too many teeth, clustered together between his ever-present smile. Sometimes his fingers seemed too long, or not long enough. I couldn’t, and still can’t, remember his eye colour. Or any colors about him really. Just dirty and washed out, like paint water. \n\nI returned to the shop after I'd gotten sick of my most recent vial - fairly mundane dreams about the dreamer’s failing marriage, that I didn’t exactly care about - when I realized the shopkeeper wasn’t smiling for once. He always smiled, no matter the circumstances, so fear wormed its way into my stomach. “*Worry not sir,*” the smile returned, “*I just have to inform you that the shop will be taking its leave soon. We will be moving onto ventures elsewhere, so you must choose your dreams wisely. We may not be here when you want to return.*”\n\nI felt crushed, sucking in a breath, opening my mouth to protest, to demand and beg that I needed this… But I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. I just muttered an ‘okay’, and sighed, getting down to choosing what could’ve been my last vial. By this point, I'd gotten good at choosing my dreams. The more colorful the liquid, the more exciting the dreams. I poured over the vials, skipping over the ones that looked like they contained nothing but sludge. And then I saw it. That fucking vial that ruined my life. It was beautiful. It was like it contained glitter glue, swirls of metallic sheens of all the colors of the rainbow. “Why would anyone give up a dream like this…” I couldn’t help but verbalize my musings.\n\n“*Everyone has their reasons sir. It is best not to pry. But I must say, you have made an interesting choice.*” the man replied, suddenly behind me.  \nI barely jumped at his sudden appearance now. But I couldn’t help but feel uneasy about what he said. ‘Interesting’.\n\n...\n\nMy first dream was simple, at least at first. I ate this weird popcorn that came out of a glowstick. It tasted absolutely disgusting, but I still ate it. And when I woke up, I could taste the acrid, buttery aftertaste on my tongue. I freaked out, upsetting my gag reflex a few times. Even after brushing my teeth the taste was still there, lingering. I tried to rationalize how the taste could’ve lingered. But deep down I knew. I knew it was the dream’s fault.\n\nI tried one more sleep. In the dream I was hit in the face with a baseball, but shrugged it off like it was nothing. So imagine my terror when I woke up with a wicked black eye, face throbbing in agony. I rushed down to the shopping mall as quickly as I could, to find the tent, find the damn man, get rid of these dreams.\n\nI collapsed to my knees when I saw the tent was gone. Not a single remnant of the thing, except the faint memory of the man's grinning face. Grinning with too many teeth.\n\nMy life has been hell since then. Each time I fell asleep, the dreams get worse. Much, much worse. I woke up shrieking, coughing and spluttering as I dreamt of being chased by sentient molten gold, the dream ending as it forced its way down my throat, burning away my vocal cords before I could even scream. I can barely speak now. I fell out of a window, cracking my head on the ground. When I woke up, I was stuck in my bed for the entire day, my head pounding and vision blurring and spinning. But the worst one, the most recent one- I accidentally cut the tip of my finger off. Golden blood, filled with golden flakes poured out of the wound, dripping and splashing onto the floor. No guesses to what I woke up to. Although I was lying in a puddle of crimson, not gold. It’s so difficult to type now. I haven’t been to the hospital, because they’ll put me under to do surgery. Who knows what I’ll dream of then? What injuries await me?\n\nI haven’t slept in days. I’m so fucking scared I’ll sleep and never wake up. But I'm so tired, and it’s getting to the point I can barely think. Is it the blood loss or the lack of sleep? I don’t know. But please, if you’ve seen a man with a tent selling dreams please help me. Before it’s too late.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Portia. For context, I am recently married. Thomas and I met through a mutual friend. It was at a fundraiser in the city. Little did I know that Thomas was one of the heirs to the family that was throwing the fundraiser. He hit it off immediately.\n\nThomas is what I would call traditionally handsome. Tall, dark haired, with blue eyes like pools of water, and a contagious smile. He was also wealthy, not that this mattered to me, although I believed that was one of the reasons I felt such coldness from his family. His sisters spent a large portion of our dating warning me off the family and making me feel left out. Whether it was the clothes I was wearing or my accent, they never gave me a chance.\n\nThomas' family was one of the largest family-run producers of poultry and pork in the United States. When I say family run, I mean a 2000 person strong industry with their surname, my new surname, punched across the deli aisles of every store in the United States.\n\n\"From Farm To Table, From Our Family To Yours\"\n\nPart of me felt like they expected me to work the farm as opposed to profit from it.\n\nHis mother, Heidi, was a little more warm, although I could see sadness in her eyes. It was like I didn't deserve this. Thomas was the only one who wasn't cold. The dating was a whirlwind of travel, fine dining, and lavish parties. I won't lie, I was completely wrapped up in the \"high society.\" Following the wedding, Thomas suggested we go to Mexico as his family regularly visited there.\n\nFast forward.\n\nThomas and I were forced to finish our honeymoon in Cancun early due to Heidi's sudden turn for the worst. She had vascular dementia and her progression (regression) was in full swing. While not ideal, these are the sacrifices you have to make for marriage. I knew Thomas would not forgive himself if something happened while we were away. In fact, I selfishly felt he would hold me responsible, although I had no reason to believe this. He wasn't the overtly petty type. As we packed our things, he made me a promise we would finish our honeymoon.\n\nA wedding gift that his family bestowed onto us was one of their manor houses. A remote, but well kept countryside home. with one hitch. We were going to live with his mother. Only for a short period of time while the family sorted out a full time live-in assistant in her own home. Until then, she was too frail and paranoid to be left on her own. I actually offered up the idea that we share the abode just until we have her settled. It was piece of mind for Thomas, and I didn’t mind getting to know my new in-law better.\n\nThe house was massive.\n\nSo much so that Heidi occupied the second floor with almost no interference in our daily lives. Aside from the occasional shout or disorientation, she pretty much stayed in her room. All in all, I cast any doubts aside and repeated the mantra that these are the small sacrifices you make for your marriage to work.\n\nAnd, I really wanted this to work.\n\nThe day we arrived it was cold and misty. The air was sharp and each inhalation stung down to my lungs, but in a good way. Heidi was arriving later in the evening, so we had some quality time to ourselves. Thomas rushed inside. He hated the cold. I suspected that due to his family's wealth he spent most of his time lazing around hot climates. As a result, the cold weather pissed him off royally. The house was clearly old, but he assured me that it had recently been refitted with modern comforts. Stone and wood complimented one another like salt and pepper on a table.\n\nI stood outside. The gravel, iced, crunched underfoot. The house stood overlooking its land. The surrounding area was lush farm with a small wooded area neatly kept, like a strategic curl on the brow of a dignified gentleman. I took a deep breath.\n\nMy new life. My new home. Mine.\n\nThe first day went as I expected. Luggage delivered. Food ordered in from the only place willing to traverse the countryside. Heidi arrived with a carer who promptly set her up on the third floor. Everything was routine until just after dinner. Once we finished cleaning up, and a bottle (or two) of wine had mysteriously disappeared, Thomas called me into the dining room. The room looked untouched for 50 years barring the photos I had dotted around the place. Honeymoon, first date, and other little memories. Thomas sat across from me and slide over a crisp piece of white paper. It was a set down a list of handwritten rules. Neat handwriting. Definitely wasn't his scrawling, haphazard hieroglyphs.\n\nI smiled. He didn't. He looked quite serious.\n\nI half expected it to be a set of rules relating to the quirks of an old house. You know what I mean. \"The upstairs bathroom door needs to be twisted counter clockwise and then pulled\" or \"the shower's hot and cold taps are actually the opposite.\" No. These weren't anything like I had seen. They were bizarre.\n\n1. No guests beyond 10pm.\n2. Do not leave windows. Unwanted visitors often come through them.\n3. At night, do not enter the kitchen. Between the hours of 1am-6am, the kitchen is off bounds to everyone.\n4. The house feeds off negative energy. Do not let it know how you truly feel.\n5. Family must be invited into the home. They cannot arrive unannounced.\n\nI looked aghast. This looked more like a list of rules for a 15th century indentured servant. Thomas looked across the oak table at me. His face was cold. In fact, the entire dining room grew cold. It was like every corner had grown eyes, holding its breath to see my reaction. My gaze fixed back on Thomas. I spread my hands across the table furrowed my brow and sighed. He moved closer and embraced me.\n\nHe thanked me for understanding and apologised. I didn’t understand though and also, why would he apologise? Did he write the note? He didn't do anything wrong. In fact, he hasn't done anything throughout our relationship.\n\nOf course, I wasn’t going to let this slide without a little Spanish Inquisition.\n\n\"What happens if we break them?\"\n\nHe flicked me a glance of surprise.\n\n\"The monster comes out, of course.\"\n\n\"No, but seriously what's the deal with these? They're a bit weird.\"\n\n“They aren’t that weird, Porsh”\n\n“An out of bounds kitchen, no guests, no family?”\n\n“You can have guests and family, and you CAN have use of the kitchen. Don’t exaggerate. They are perfectly manageable”\n\n“But are they necessary?”\n\n“I wouldn’t have given you them if they weren’t”\n\n“Why though?”\n\n\"Look, Heidi asked me to give them to you. She has superstitions about the house. She talked about it even when Dad was alive. Calls it the Ungeheuer. Says it haunts the family or whatever. I know it isn't ideal, but we sort of signed up for this.\"\n\n(I don't speak German, so this habit of introducing it into our conversations was a constant point of annoyance for me)\n\n\"Not sure I remember signing up to these rules\"\n\nI could see Thomas was finished with the conversation, and I knew his emotional front would slowly descend if I keep this up.\n\nI relented.\n\n“Fine”\n\n\"In sickness and health,\" he winked.\n\nOkay. Whatever. Heidi was spooked by some sort of strange folklore monster. Great. Add that to the list of peculiarities that old people have.\n\nSmall sacrifices for the better good.\n\nIn the intervening months, I would stay at home and take care of Heidi. She was largely independent, but at night, she could meander. This meant someone had to mind her. Added to the fact that Thomas' job was demanding, it seemed a natural, albeit by my own insistence - temporary fit until a long term solution was in place.\n\nI also obliged to follow the rules. Not out of fear. Not our of anger or paranoia, but out of a genuine desire to make things work. If this is what I have to do to smooth this temperamental house or monster or whatever it was, so be it.\n\nLike I said, the house had recently been refitted with heating and insulation. The wood warmed and the stone softened. The three rooms on the ground floor- kitchen, living room, and dining room begun to glow with lived experience.\n\nThe first floor was our room\n\nHeidi filled the upstairs and second floor with the continuous hum of 1950s and 60s music. While she was not altogether still with it, mentally speaking, she had a keen ear for music throughout her life. It gave the house a nostalgic buzz, and I must admit I secretly thanked God her sense of taste hadn't been eaten away.\n\nI made efforts with her. I tried to talk to her about Thomas growing up. The house itself. Her late husband. Many of these topics were light and open ended, but the thought of her late husband always caused her to burst into tears. She would regularly say he was here. Or to be more precise, he was close.\n\nIt was in these busy days that I totally forgot the rules that I had received on the first day. I forgot the second rule. Was a total slip of the mind. Thomas and I had eaten, watched a movie in the sitting room. I left two windows open in the dining room because I recently applied a light coat of varnish on some of the old chairs. The smell was noxious, and I needed the crisp cold breeze to fumigate the room. Thomas was early. A meeting he had to attend. I slept in.\n\nWhen I finally awoke I stayed laying in bed, going over my plans for the day as well as the memories of last night. The dinner. The wine. A pretty decent horror movie about the disappearances of the Plain-View Neighbourhood Association. Then it struck me. THE WINDOWS.\n\nI launched myself out of bed. Ran downstairs towards the dining room. My hand trembled on the doorknob. I braced myself mentally as I opened the door. The first thing I noticed was that the windows were shut. The curtains were drawn open. As I surveyed the room nothing seemed out of place. I checked under the long antique table. I shook each chair. Everything seemed fine? Then, as I was about to leave the room, I spotted it. The photos.\n\nEach photo had been destroyed. Wedding, honeymoon, first dates, all destroyed. They were ripped to shreds and strewn across the floor like a nasty jigsaw puzzle. I couldn't contain my tears. At that moment, Heidi entered the room. She must drift through this building because I never hear her. She is ghost like.\n\nI choked out the words.\n\n\"The Monster?\"\n\nShe nodded. She moved closer and embraced me. She knew. The rest of the day we spent cleaning up the broken glass frames.\n\nWe replaced what we could, but ultimately some of those memories were gone forever. Like a jealous ex, they had been smashed to pieces.\n\nI resolved myself and decided to keep this to myself. Thomas worked long hours and the last thing he needed to know was that I couldn't keep the simple rules of the house. I swore to myself that I would do everything in my power to abide by the rules. In 4 weeks we only had three instances where the rules in which the rules were almost violated.\n\nOne night I was in a half daze, I sluggishly made my way to the kitchen, but stopped at the top of the stairs. I snapped to my senses and returned to bed. Thomas had not moved a muscle, but I sensed he knew. He knew I almost broke rule 3. Thankfully, I didn't, but I could tell by his tense muscles as I hugged him in the morning before he left for work. He wasn't happy.\n\nThe second time was on a lazy Sunday. I was tired from dinner and drinks the night before. Thomas was out for a work event for a few days leaving me alone with Heidi who hardly moved out of her room for the entire day. Just 15 minutes after 1am, when the kitchen was off limits, Heidi had left her room. I rushed downstairs to begin prepping and lo and behold. A meal was there. It looked like meatball with some white sauce. Small capers dotted around it. It looked quite good, but where was Heidi?\n\nI eventually found her roaming the downstairs sitting room. She was writing on a small piece of paper.\n\n\"Du siehst den Wald vor lauter Bäumen nicht.\"\n\nThe handwriting. It was identical to the rules. Heidi looked at me and winked. It wasn't a \"I got you\" wink, but more a \"I know what you're thinking.\"\n\nOnce I put her back to bed, I made my way back to my room, but not before leaning over the bannister and \"apologising\" to who or whatever was down there. Thankfully, nothing came of the whole situation, and I decided to bury it.\n\nI brought her to bed. Two days later, looking jetlagged and irritable. Thomas arrived back home. I left him be.\n\nThe third instance was more embarrassing that anything else. My older sister turned up unexpectedly. Thomas answered the door. He looked perplexed. I didn't grasp the full extent of the conversation, but after a brief back and forth, a bit of laughter and smiles, he turned to me and just whispered \" Rule 6.\" I had to feign the worst stomach bug even going so far as to pretend like I was having coughing fits.\n\nI felt utterly helpless as Claire smiled sincerely, nodded, and said if I needed anything just to let her know. In her words, \"I had disappeared.\" I didn't agree with her. I have routinely tried to make things work with our family. I even go as far as to make handmade presents every birthday. While I may have missed a few birthday recently, it wasn't due to anything malicious, I was just busy. Anyway, I had a family I needed to care for, so excuse me for prioritising myself for once.\n\nThe night I broke the cardinal rule, I knew things were far more serious than Thomas and Heidi had let on. I was awoken to a loud crashing downstairs. I tried to shake Thomas awake, but he firmly gripped the covers and turned his back to me. Never get in the way of a man and his sleep. With trepidation, I left the bedroom and stood deathly quiet in the dark.\n\nI moved towards the stairs and held my breath as I saw light creeping out of Heidi's room on the second floor. Quietly, I made my way to her room.\n\n\"Heidi?\"\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\nEmpty. Fuck.\n\nI spun on a pivot as I heard the sounds of something barraging down the stairs. I leaned over the second floor stairs looking right down to the hall on the ground floor. Nothing. I glided down the stairs to the first floor, my floor, and stood nervous at the top of the stairs leading to the ground floor. If Heidi really was in danger, I had to pursue whatever had made that racket.\n\nI descended.\n\nIn the pitch black rooms, I crouched as I surveyed the surroundings in the hopes of finding her. Dining Room, clear. Living Room, clear. The kitchen was really the only place she could still be. All other rooms were locked.\n\nWhether in my head or not, the whole room caved in. I felt as if two hands were pressed to either side of my skull. I blinked hard and entered the kitchen. I held my breath. In front of me was Heidi. She was preparing a meal.\n\n\"Heidi\"\n\n\"You shouldn't be down here\"\n\n\"Heidi, let's go back upstairs\"\n\nShe turned towards me with tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Okay, Heidi, let's go\"\n\nShe looked past me, \"Er ist ganz der vater\"\n\nI looked over her shoulder to see two blue dots and a wicked white smile reflected in the kitchen window behind her.\n\nThen everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up sore and tired, Thomas was standing over me. I was in my bed. My head was bandaged. Dried blood in my hair. I couldn't tell when exactly what time is was, but it was morning now.\n\n\"Rule. 3\"\n\nHe shook his head. Dressed impeccably, he turned and left the room.\n\nThe next few months were a blur. Rules changed. Each room warped and molded to the emotions we threw out. It was as if the Monster not only had control over our lives, but the very fabric of my home.\n\nA once welcoming house became a hostile minefield of rules.\n\nTime became unimportant. Only the rules matters. Music was not to be played. Doors were to be locked. Food was to be prepared to a fine detail. If not, the monster would return. The smaller the  rules, the more subtle the punishment. One night, when I had forgotten to turn the TV off, I woke to the sounds of the monster destroying the downstairs furniture. I locked the bedroom door and waited for it to pass.\n\nAs time passed. The rules became my life. Guests rarely arrived. Family were not invited. I couldn't risk angering the Monster that inhabited this home.\n\nIt was during another day of abiding by the rules, I heard a bellowing voice from the dining room.\n\n\"Come downstairs\"\n\nThe voice was almost unrecognisable. Hints of humanity, but largely a foreign creature. After a few moments of nervousness, I left my room and moved towards the stairs. Above me, Heidi. I could see it in her eyes. Acceptance.\n\nI descended the stairs. The monster was sat in the dining room. Stoic. It presented me with a new list of rules.\n\nI sat there. Eyes red. Sleepless. The bruises that had healed were replaced with new ones. From tripping down the stairs to accidently catching my hand in the dining room doorframe. The cutlery had worn thin due to repeated destruction by the monster. The house, once warm and inviting was cold and claustrophobic. The original rules had been modified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. No guests ~~beyond 10pm.~~\n2. Do not leave windows. ~~Unwanted visitors often come through them~~. You have no reason to leave.\n3. At night, ~~do not enter the kitchen. between the hours of 1am-6am, the kitchen is off bounds to everyone,~~ do not leave your room.\n4. The ~~house~~ community feeds off negative energy. Do not let ~~it~~ them know how you truly feel.\n5. Family must not be invited into the home. They cannot arrive ~~unannounced~~.\n\nThe writing, a familiar handwriting. The monster looked up from the table. His deep blue eyes like pools to the abyss stared dead across from me. His contagious smile now infectious. He asked for my signature. I signed with my weak hand as I was nursing a sprain from a rule violation the previous morning.\n\nHe embraced me and forgave me for my constant violations. He said he loved me and left. I heard the door lock. I sat there. I re-read the rules again. They are the sacrifices you make for a happy marriage, right?",

But\n\nI know what you are thinking, it’s just your bedroom door, but there was something very off about it the first night I looked at it. I woke up sometime really late or early morning, I couldn’t really tell, but the door just looked really strange. I always shut my door before going to sleep because my roommate, Geoff, has a very reasonable but loud habit of getting high and watching weird YouTube stuff on his Fridays (everyone else’s Tuesday) and the door keeps most of the sound out. However, I could see into the living room, even as I was laying down. The yellow tinge of the street lights was glowing on the back of the couch through blinds and it all looked really calm…. But *why* could I see all of that?\n\nI quietly got up to see if maybe I was just simply drained after my day and laid down without enough time to complete my normal nightly routine but as I looked at it the door was closed… or… that isn't the right word. It was in line with the wall like a door should be if it was closed but the door wasn’t long enough. The latch to my door didn’t reach. The door just wasn’t snug to the frame like a door is supposed to be. “Huh” I quietly said aloud.\n\nAnd then, with a satisfying and hushed *pop*, I blinked as I jumped back. The sudden sound was alarming in the dead quiet.  But in that instant my door was back in place, latched and pressed to the frame that houses it. And with that I turned around and slunk back to my bed to finish the rest of my dream priorities I had all but forgotten.\n\nI wasn’t meant to see anything but I did. Just earlier today I was stopped at a red light and noticed a nice looking man, he was old, but he wore a smile that told me he was taking his retirement in great stride.\n\nSomething was wrong. He was looking at the birds flying about (*Good*) and at the bus as it drove around the corner (*Good*) and he was just walking down the street (*NOT Good*). He wasn’t walking down the street. It *looked* like he was walking but he wasn’t moving. The arm swing and movements were right but he was just gliding his feet on the ground but didn’t seem to realize it. Long strands of black were just becoming visible as they pierced up from the ground. They were bending at certain spots, like notches that were a bit knobby to the thin needle strands. Then as my staring got more intense, *pop,* and he began to move normally again, no more gliding like he was in Call of Duty and his connection was timing out and no more black cacophony of fibers reaching up. He did have an odd expression on his face though like he was forgetting something, or better yet remembering something sad, unbelievably sad. A couple honks from behind alerted me that I and everyone else in my lane of traffic was going to be late for work, so off I went, giving the moment just a quick shake of my head and a promise I would finally go to the doctor after work, or end of the month, or whenever I get the chance.\n\nWhy did I have to see it? Why would it let me?\n\nI’m not sure what was worse: realizing that the sound I was hearing was reality closing itself back up and that if that’s the case then maybe our world was destined to fall apart ***or*** realizing that there was something behind reality that was coming through. It was in charge of fixing it, sewing up the loose ends of existence so the fabric of the material world doesn’t fall apart. What I was seeing was the fraying of that fabric and I could only guess that I was seeing the labor of the tailor keeping it working. I have told myself that over and over but in all honesty I knew the definitive truth all along. It isn’t fixing anything. It is feeding. It exists through our world's failures and it uses the shadow that is cast on its world like a bridge to reach us.I haven’t seen my roommate in a good few days now. You see I made a grave error in thinking about how things are made right when it arrives and then subsequently leaves. I failed to realize that it takes something, too. Geoff always crashes on the couch on his days off but I clearly could see the couch empty when I visualize that first encounter. And now after I know what to look for, I remember that old man I saw on my drive to work wasn’t alone. He was walking with his wife before it came to *fix* the error of reality.\n\nIt needs to eat, no, no, no, it *wants* to eat. When it enters here there is always some side effect. Those needle fingers aren’t to clean up the mess but to feast on whatever creatures they have time to grab. All that fit are its fingers. I know because I can see it and it knows I can because it can see me.\n\nMy bedroom is smaller than when I left the house today. Its hard to tell in the dark but the far wall has been moving closer and shrinking the room. The dark shadows have long past where my bed normally is and the dark wall is almost at the bedroom door now. And I- I can *see* it. There are the faintest muffled, bubbling, deep breaths that sound like the intake of a scuba diver who is running out of oxygen and is looking for his way out, using his few breaths to keep himself alive.\n\nBut its eyes scare me the most. I want to let you know there is a clear and awfully numbing difference between the darkest place you have ever seen at night and a hole so deep and *hungry* it devours anything, even the light. It will not stop. Not even for a second until it gets to me.\n\nThe tendrils aren’t just to grab you, they fill you with dread and hopelessness. I can’t run now, I can’t even remember why I would want to. There is nothing left for it to eat now besides my physical self because who I was feels so far away now.",

        "text": " This Christmas was no different from any other Christmas me and my husband bought so many big gifts for our son after all he was 6.  We made Christmas as magic as possible for him. But this year he asked for a signed book from his favorite author but neither me or my husband could find it anywhere so we left it be and made up for it in the gifts from Santa. Last night we laid out the cookies and the milk for Santa and my husband and I read him the polar express. After awhile he fell asleep that gave me and my husband time to eat half of the cookies and leave bite marks on the cookies to make it more special. Me and my husband went to sleep excited for the following day. \n\n\n 3:00 AM- I woke up and heard footsteps in our living room I got up swiftly and poked my head out the door to my surprise it was nothing. We had an old house so I excused it as that and went back to bed \n\n\n8:00 AM- I am woken up by Tommy our child bouncing on our bed we went down the hall into the living room where our tree was. Tommy began opening presents but I stopped him I stood there as my heart dropped I see 3 gifts with strange wrapping paper that we have never purchased them. My husband comes into the room and I show him there is one for each of us. I read out loud \"To Tommy Love the bunny man. \n\nMy hands were shaking as I opened the gift it was coal coal coal in every single one I was confused who would do this and what for I saw a letter on the tree in that se paper no envelope just that silly wrapping paper it said to Tommy. I opened it and what was inside shocked me to my core it said \"Tommy I have been watching you for 37 days you are not a good kid you are the furthest from it to make your parents proud take the knife I left under ypur bed from last te and do it stab yourself Tommy your parents don't love you do it.\"  I started sobbing who would do this. My husband gestures to Tommy and said \"go ahead bud open your gifts\" as he opened the fist gift I noticed it wasn't wrapped neatly like I had done it looked re wrapped the next thing I hear is a blood curdling scream as a head fell out of the gift. I call the police but all of the power lines are out \"fuck we are on our own\" my husband said as we all tore open the gifts it was a full body each box containing a limb instead of the gifts we bought the body was not that unfamiliar it was my husband's dad my husband broke down and started incoherently murmuring. All I could make out was \"kill them all\" over and over again I grabbed Tommy and the car keys my husband still on the floor I turn to go out the front door and there he is the bunny man he was dressed in a bunny suit covered in blood. He was at our front door I screamed \"why us you are sick\" all of a sudden my words fell out of my mout as I felt my husband's hands on my shoulders but these weren't my husband's they were long and grey I turn around and my husband has an erie grin on his face \"don't worry darling you'll be one of us soon\" he says grabbing Tommy I screamed as loud as I could \"don't take Tommy take me let Tommy go\" and before I knew it Tommy ran into his room and grabbed the knife I stood there motionless if I tried to move I was scared I was going to end up like my husband. Tommy grabbed the knife and handed it to the bunny man, the bunny man picked up the knife and started stabbing Tommy over and over and over again I will never be able to get the squelches out of my mind they all had lifeless eyes and turned around to look at me as I stood there crying my eyes out Tommy said \"Mommy it's okay you don't need to worry just come with us be one of us\" as his voice slowly distorted from that Sweet Child like voice to a raspy demonic voice I screamed knowing there was no way out of it they each gripped onto my arms and legs and pulled me under Tommy's bed the last words I heard was \"it will only hurt a bit\" from my husband.",

        "text": " I’m writing this from my closet right now. I think he’s in the house.\n\nLet me explain how I even created him. This all started about a month ago. I’m not a scientist or anything, I’m a Junior in high school. I didn’t get my hands on any super advanced technology, or at least I don’t think I did. Actually, it’s my mom who got it for me. She has somewhat of a shopping addiction. It’s not what you might think though. She doesn’t obsessively buy clothes or purses; what she buys is much more random. I can’t exactly think of a specific category of items. She buys from places like thrift stores, pawn shops, flea markets and swap meets. I’m not sure which one she bought this from.\n\nShe had been gone for hours, which is normal for her. When she came back she had bags of random decorations for our already cluttered house. Not surprising. It was even less surprising when she insisted on showing off every item and asking me where to put it. As always, I wasn’t really paying attention. I mean, if I partook in this habit of hers every time she came back from a shopping spree, I’d have lost my mind by now.\n\n“I bought this one for you,” She said as she held up a battered old box. It wasn’t very big, about a foot wide and a foot long. It caught my attention.\n\n“What’s in it?” I asked as I turned off my phone. She didn’t buy things specifically for me very often since I was never really interested in any of it.\n\n“Go look,” She said as she placed it down on the kitchen counter. By the time I walked over she was already admiring something else she’d bought.\n\nWhen I opened the box, I was confused. It was an assortment of seemingly random items. An old retro alarm clock, a small plastic cylinder with a funnel attached to the top, a rusted pair of scissors, tweezers, and a syringe with a faint red stain along the interior. But what interested and confused me the most was the eight inch long glass cylinder. It seemed to be almost an inch thick, thoroughly sealing in the inky black liquid inside. I picked it up and was surprised to note that the liquid was quite warm. Tilting the bottle side to side revealed that it was rather viscous. The liquid was about two inches below the cylinder’s metal cap, leaving a bit of space. Near the top was a small line that I assumed was the fill limit. I put the cylinder back down and glanced into the box again. This time I spotted a piece of paper buried beneath the random items. Careful not to cut myself on the syringe or scissors, I pulled the paper out and was disappointed to find that it was written in a different language. It was also pretty old. It was stained a light yellow and had a few cracks and rips in it. Not ancient by any means but definitely written at least two decades ago.\n\nI dropped the paper back into the box and turned to my mom, “What is this?”\n\n“Did you see it?” She said as she analyzed a small abstract painting.\n\n“Yeah. What is it?”\n\n“It’s supposed to help you…” She got distracted by something in another one of her bags, “...make friends or something,”\n\n“Or something? How is this supposed to help me make friends?” I was getting annoyed at this point. She always pestered me about leaving the house and talking to people more often.\n\n“The man who sold it to me didn’t speak very good English,” She said as she dug through another bag, “I think he spoke Spanish or something,”\n\n“So you bought something and you don’t even know what it is?” Honestly, why was I surprised? It was just like her.\n\n“Just try it out,” She said as she waved me off.\n\nI grabbed the box and left for my room. If I stayed any longer then it would probably turn into an argument, and then she’d be passive aggressive and angry for at least a week until she spontaneously calmed down.\n\nHonestly, I put the box down in a corner of my room and forgot about it for a while. The week went by, but eventually my mom noticed. I’ll spare you the details of the conversation, but basically she was mad that I didn’t even try the gift. I decided to try it in an attempt to appease her. If I didn’t, I’d have to take the bus for a week to spare myself the uncomfortable car rides to school.\n\nSo, I cleared my desk and put down the box. The first thing I had to do was translate that paper. Not too difficult. I tried taking a picture of it, but the translation was rough so I opted for manually typing it out. To my disappointment, the paper didn’t explain what the contents of the box were meant for. It did, however, have instructions for what to do.\n\n*Follow the instructions below exactly:*\n\n*Do not spill the mixture*\n\nI assume it means the black liquid\n\n*Collect two DNA samples (Saliva, hair, teeth, blood, or urine)*\n\nThe teeth and blood concerned me. What in the world was this for?\n\n*Carefully open the container.* ***DO NOT TOUCH*** *the mixture.*\n\n*Drop the DNA samples into the mixture*\n\n*Seal completely. Shake the new mixture and let sit for forty-eight hours.* ***DO NOT TOUCH THE CONTAINER DURING THIS PERIOD.***\n\n*Collect after forty-eight hours.*\n\nI still had no clue what this would do, but I really didn’t want to deal with the school bus, so I continued. I didn’t think much would come of it.\n\nI peered into the box again to decide what DNA samples to use. I shuddered as I saw the tweezers and remembered that ‘teeth’ was an option. And the red tint inside the syringe was more concerning now. I moved them both aside and looked at the remaining options. The funnel and plastic cylinder must’ve been for the saliva and the scissors were likely for the hair. I was very thankful that there wasn’t a container for the urine sample, since it seemed like some of these had been used. While I wasn’t keen on cutting my hair, it looked like the cylinder might overflow if I added too much liquid, so saliva and hair it was.\n\nI grabbed everything I needed and headed to the bathroom. I washed out the container for saliva and, long story short, collected what I needed. Then I grabbed a lock of hair that I hoped wouldn’t be too noticeable and cut it off. Now to open the container. It actually took me a while- it was sealed *really* tight. When it finally came off, I was glad that there was a paper seal underneath, since I stumbled back and the mixture would’ve spilled. At that point I was a little nervous. The warnings were vague. I wondered what would happen if I touched it. Of course, I wasn’t going to test it out, but I was curious. Discarding the thought, I carefully peeled off the seal. I dropped my hair and saliva inside, then twisted on the cap as tight as I could. I shook the bottle and then wondered where I should put it. I decided to leave it in the cupboard under the sink so it wouldn’t get in the way.\n\nOnce everything was cleaned up I returned to my room and remembered I needed to set a timer. I could’ve used my phone, but I decided that I might as well use what was provided. After a quick Google search on how to use that old ass clock, I set it to go off in forty-eight hours. Then I cleaned everything up and told my mom. She was mostly appeased, so I carried on with my life.\n\nNothing much happened during those two days. All I did was catch a tiny cold.\n\nBut when the timer went off, I wasn’t home. I got back from Sam’s house a few hours after the alarm went off. Mom wasn’t home to turn it off, so when I opened the door, I heard it ringing from my room. Now, I got a little nervous when this happened. The note didn’t say what I had to do *after* the forty-eight hours were over.\n\nI walked to my room and turned off the alarm, then rushed to the bathroom. When I opened the cupboard, all that was left were glass shards and the metal cap. This was a confusing sight, but my best guess at the time was that the liquid had evaporated. Maybe there was a chemical reaction? It was too hot and the glass cracked? I wasn’t sure. All I did was clean up and throw away the evidence. It's not like I could’ve guessed what had *actually* happened.\n\nThe night got worse. What I thought was a cold turned into a pretty severe fever very quickly. At first it was a cough, then nausea, then fatigue. Within the hour I had thrown up three times and decided to try and sleep it off.\n\nWhen I woke up, I didn’t feel any better. I didn’t even feel well enough to call in sick for school. I’d take the absence. Took me hours to finally get out of bed and hobble my way to the kitchen to heat up some soup. My head was aching and I was pretty dizzy. I managed to get most of the soup down and tried watching TV for a while. Eventually I made my way back to my room, where I proceeded to fall asleep again. When I woke up this time, I finally felt a bit better. Still felt like throwing up, but it was slightly better. My mom was home by that point and was helping take care of me. She brought me food and medicine, so that was nice. On the fourth day, I felt well enough. Still had a bit of a headache, but it was manageable.\n\nThen Sam texted me.\n\n*Sam- ‘U ok?’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Yeah, been sick’*\n\n*Sam-’K’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U were looking weird’*\n\nI glanced around my room and wondered if he was making a weird joke.\n\n*Mike- ‘Wdym?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U had a weird look on your face’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Can you see me rn?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Saw you a few mins ago’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Shut up. Are you outside?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Yeah idiot, in the park’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U walked past me a minute ago’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Whatever. Come inside or stop being a creep.’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Wat?’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Been in my house all day. I’m sick, remember?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Come on, just saw you, don’t lie’*\n\nAt that point I sent him a picture of me lying in bed.\n\n*Sam- ‘Wtf??? I swear that was u’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Nope’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Must’ve been a doppelganger’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Whatever you say’*\n\nThe rest of the conversation past this point is pretty irrelevant. Obviously at the time I didn’t think it was the thing that’s currently outside my house. I figured Mike saw someone that looked like me and got confused. In hindsight, I know that’s not the case.\n\nI saw the truth the next day. My mom had left for work and I was feeling pretty good. I got out of bed to go use the bathroom. When I looked through the doorway, I screamed. I hadn’t even realized that he looked exactly like me, I was just freaked out that there was another person in the house. But as I stared at him, I noticed that he was my spitting image. My brown hair, my hazel eyes, my pale complexion, my height. Everything. The only thing different about him was his clothes. An old pair of jeans I hadn’t worn in a while and the gray sweater I got last year.\n\nI was frozen. He wasn’t looking at me though, he was looking in the mirror, analyzing his face. *My* face. Slowly, he turned his head. It’s a strange sensation, seeing your own eyes looking back at you. But this thing, there was no emotion on his face. If eyes are the window to the soul, then he doesn’t have one. When he took a step towards me I bolted to my room and slammed the door behind me, being very sure to lock it. My heart was racing and I think I was starting to hyperventilate. Really, it’s all a blur of panic. I’d never had a panic attack before, but I think that’s the closest I ever got. My mind was still trying to grapple with what I had seen, so it took me a while to start searching for my phone. My hands shook as I sifted through the blankets on my bed, trying to see where I’d left it. I screamed again when someone knocked on my door. By then I just ripped the blankets off my bed but still couldn’t find it.\n\n“Michael,” My muffled voice said from the other side of the door. It was monotone and just sounded wrong.\n\nI checked my nightstand and it wasn’t there either. My legs were weak and I felt like crying. I couldn’t find my phone anywhere. Another knock came from the door. I frantically searched the room for any exit, my eyes landing on the window.\n\n“Is there something wrong?” He asked with no concern or confusion in his voice. I probably should’ve been a bit quieter, but I was in a panic. I ran for the window and fumbled with the latch. Another knock at the door. I pulled on the handle, not remembering which way it was to unlock it. When the latch finally clicked, I shoved the window open and was outside in seconds. After that I just started running. All I knew was that I needed help. In my panic, I passed by multiple people who seemed a little concerned, but I didn’t think to ask them. My adrenaline rush carried me the three blocks over to Sam’s house.\n\nI told him about everything and he called the cops for me as I tried to calm down. I’m not sure whether he believed me or not, but he definitely was concerned. We made our way back to my house where the cops had already arrived. Nobody was found inside and there were no signs of forced entry. The officer taking our statements seemed annoyed and indirectly told us off. ‘Calling the police is serious’ and stuff like that. My mom was called, and needless to say, she wasn’t too pleased.\n\nAt first she was a little concerned, but our conversation turned into an argument. I told her about who I saw and she thought that I’d made the whole thing up. She complained about having to leave her job early and how she couldn’t afford to do that. Needless to say, the conversation got ugly. I’m not all that proud of how I handled it, but at a certain point I brought up how much money she spent because of her shopping addiction. We got into some personal stuff and by the end of it I was grounded. I made sure to lock my door and window before going to bed that night.\n\nFriday came and went. It was hard to focus as I spent the whole day looking out for whoever I’d seen. By the time school was over, I was feeling pretty unsure of myself. My brain started coming up with excuses. Maybe my fever had been worse than I thought. Maybe I had been really tired. I didn’t know. The police didn’t find anything and it *did* sound really weird. I think anyone’s brain would’ve started making excuses by then. Don’t worry though, I saw him again and all my theories were disproved.\n\nMy mom soon left to visit family. I decided to skip the trip both due to the car ride and to avoid my mother complaining to my family members about me in my face. Since I was still grounded, she took my phone with her. It had been a while since the incident, and while it still creeped me out, my brain had finally convinced me that I was mistaken. It was the afternoon and I had to go to the bathroom. When I looked through the doorway, there he was again. I think I caught him practicing how to smile because when he turned to me, he wore a horrifying grin.\n\n“Jesus- fuck-” I stumbled back into the wall, then turned and ran for the kitchen. I didn’t hear him follow me but I grabbed a knife anyway. When I turned around, there he was, expressionless once again.\n\nHe looked down at the knife and cocked his head to the side, “I don’t understand your concern,”\n\nMy hands were shaky as I tried to compose myself, which was hard to do when I was looking at proof that this thing was real, “Who… the fuck… are you…” I said as I backed away from him. I was really trying to control my breathing.\n\nHe looked back up at me, “Do you not remember?”\n\nI didn’t respond. I was too busy trying to find a way to get away from him. Running around the kitchen island and for the front door might’ve worked, but I wasn’t sure how fast he was. What if he caught me? What would he do? The question was enough to keep me where I was.\n\nHe interrupted my thoughts, “You saw me five days ago,”\n\n“No shit,”\n\nI hadn’t seen him blink once that entire time, “You created me seven days ago,”\n\nNow confusion entered the mix of fear and desperation I was feeling. I had no clue what he was talking about. He said nothing else, so I tried thinking about what he was referring to. What was I doing seven days ago? The only thing I could think of that was out of the ordinary was the weird gift my mom gave me. How the fuck would that create *him*?\n\n“To my understanding, you are,” He analyzed my face for a moment, “Fearful,”\n\n“What the fuck do you want?” I said as I took a tentative step sideways around the kitchen island. He didn’t move, though his gaze followed me. Then the doorbell rang. I jumped and looked towards the door, then looked back at him. Except, he was gone. I spun around but didn’t see him everywhere, “Fuck!” I sprinted towards the door and flung it open, rushing past Sam.\n\nI can’t remember much else about that day. I spent it looking over my shoulder and trying to grasp what I’d seen. I told Sam about everything, and he tried his best to help. He let me stay at his house that night, since I was too anxious in my own, and didn’t dismiss what I was saying. After having told him everything, I was pretty quiet. He didn’t pry, but he was researching something on his computer for most of the day. And things didn’t get much better after that.\n\nI didn’t see him for a few days. I was staying at Sam’s during that time in the spare room. His little brother Bobby was loud, but it was better than being alone at my own house. Sam told his mom that I wasn’t feeling safe and she accepted that. She was certainly more empathetic than my own mother. Sam and I talked about what could be happening. He passively mentioned the possibility that who I saw may not have been real, but dismissed it when he saw that I was certain. We eventually came to the conclusion that it must’ve been related to my mom’s gift. We didn’t know how it worked, but the fact that it needed my DNA was suspicious.\n\nI was constantly on edge after the incident. I tried to relax, but I felt uneasy around the windows. It felt like I was being watched. Sam said that it was probably paranoia, but I think he could feel it too. He seemed slightly more jumpy, more on edge. Thankfully his mother and brother seemed to be pretty unbothered, though I saw Ms. Watson sage the house one night. From what Sam had told me in the past, that was supposed to ward off negative energy. I didn’t believe in the supernatural, but I hoped that if it were real that the sage would do something.\n\nBobby was only six years old. I cared about him, but he could certainly be annoying sometimes. He stayed up past his bedtime running around his room and loudly listening to YouTube videos. The walls were pretty thin, so I could hear him all night.\n\n“How does he have so much energy when he never sleeps?” I asked Sam one day as we were watching something in the living room. We could hear him laughing down the hall.\n\n“I ask myself that question every day,”\n\n“How do you get to bed?”\n\nSam took in a deep breath, “You get used to it eventually,”\n\nI uncomfortably glanced out the window as the sun began to go down. I was mentally getting ready to go to bed. Once it got dark, it was really hard to sleep. The stillness outside my window was occasionally broken by the wind or the rustling of the leaves outside. Any noise made me jump. We watched TV for a while longer before I left for my room. As I did every night, I checked and double checked every corner of the room. Under the bed, in the closet, and outside the window. Then I drew the curtains to be safe. Once I was ready, I got into bed and tried my best to block out Bobby.\n\nThat night I actually slept quite well. I would’ve liked to believe that it was me getting used to the background noise, but I know that’s not what happened. Bobby was quieter that night, but I hadn’t really noticed. After the second night of getting good sleep, I wondered if Ms. Watson had spoken to Bobby about being quieter. On the third night is when I noticed something was wrong.\n\nI fell asleep for a while, but I was awoken by Bobby’s giggling. Not uncommon. I rolled over in bed and tried to go back to sleep. Once again Bobby was talking to his tablet as if the YouTubers he watched could hear him. This went on for twenty minutes before I noticed that I hadn’t heard any music. Every night, I heard the annoying songs the YouTubers he watched played for every intro and outro. But I hadn't heard any. This made me sit up. As I listened closer, I could hear another voice. A familiar voice. Ice ran through my veins. It couldn’t be. Bobby giggled again. I pressed my ear against the wall and strained to listen. They were speaking very quietly, and I really wanted to believe that it was a video. But in all of the video’s Bobby watched, the YouTubers were just as loud as he normally was. I took a deep breath and willed myself to get out of bed, really *really* hoping I was mistaken. But if I wasn’t, I couldn’t leave Bobby in there alone.\n\nI tried my best to make sure the bed didn’t squeak and silently made my way across the room. Creaking my door open as gently as possible, I tried to look down the dark hall. The only light visible came from underneath Bobby’s door. I stood frozen as I hoped for the best. Taking my first step out of the room, it seemed like the air around me changed. It was so still. Carefully, I made my way down the hall, trying to listen to the voices over my beating heart. The sound of my feet against the wooden floors seemed so loud in the near silence. Only three feet away from Bobby’s door, I was certain. It was *him*. I was scared, but also mad. It was one thing to torment me, but he had followed me here. He was doing god knows what with Bobby, who had nothing to do with the situation. I knew I should probably grab a weapon, but as I stepped in front of Bobby’s door, the voices stopped. I felt so vulnerable. In the middle of a pitch black hall, I didn’t know what this thing was, what it wanted, or what it would do when I opened the door.\n\nSwallowing the lump in my throat, I opened my mouth, “Bobby?” I called out, though it came out quieter than I had intended. I heard a little giggle from inside. Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the handle and swung the door open.\n\nBobby was sitting on the ground. His face was turned to me, but his body was facing the other direction. Facing towards his open window. And when he saw me, he clapped, “How did you do that?!”\n\n“What?” I asked, my voice wavering. I looked around his room. He was the only person in there, but his tablet was charging on his bed.\n\n“Do it again!”\n\nI stepped into his room and checked behind the door, then looked back at him. He was still smiling, his eyes full of amazement. I looked at the window again, then crossed the room and slammed it shut, being sure to lock it, “Who were you talking to?” I asked as I looked outside.\n\nI already knew the answer, “You!” Bobby giggled.\n\nI didn’t know what to say. How could I explain this to him? Now I didn’t *feel* like I was being watched, I knew I was being watched. I didn’t know where he was, but he was watching me. I took Bobby and rushed over to Sam’s room, then rapped on the door until he opened.\n\n“*What?*” He asked, clearly irritated,\n\n“We need to talk,” I said as I looked around.\n\n“Right now?”\n\n“Yes, now,”\n\nHe must’ve seen how panicked I was, because he let me and Bobby in, “What happened?” He asked with a bit more concern.\n\nI sent Bobby to sit on Sam’s bed while we spoke, “He was here,”\n\nIt took him a moment to realize what I was saying, “What?”\n\n“He was talking to Bobby,”\n\nSam stood there, shocked. He shook his head, then rushed over to his little brother, “Are you okay? What happened?”\n\nBobby was confused, as he’d realized we were upset, “Me and Mike were talking for a while,”\n\n“About what?” Sam pressed him to continue.\n\nBobby shrugged, “I don’t know, he told me to be quieter. Then he did a magic trick by leaving through the window and coming back in through the door,” Bobby looked at me for confirmation, but I was too busy trying not to panic.\n\nSam rubbed his hand over his face and thought for a moment, “Okay… don’t do that again,” Bobby furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, “That was… that was someone doing a magic trick to look like Mike. Don’t talk to them. Lock your doors and windows.”\n\nBobby seemed rightfully scared but agreed to not talk to them again. Sam and I spent a while trying to calm him down, but eventually he only agreed to sleep in Sam’s room for the night. When I went back to bed that night, I was certain I could hear footsteps outside. The next day Sam and I contemplated telling his mom, but decided against it. Yes, we know now that was a mistake. But at the time we were scared she would react as my mom did. As well, Sam was scared that she might kick me out. Now, obviously I was scared of that as well, but I also felt bad for putting Sam and his family in danger. Still, he insisted that we try and wait it out. We spent the rest of that day brainstorming what it could want and how to make it go away. At this point, Sam fully believed me. In the end, we had no clue. If I had created it, I didn’t create it for any certain purpose. We didn’t know what it was trying to do. By the end of the day, we gave up and prepared for the night.\n\nI could hear the footsteps for a while. I’d say they went on for about an hour before suddenly coming to a halt. I didn’t know why, until there was a knock at my window. Nothing too loud, but it made my breath catch in my throat. I kept my eyes shut and waited for it to go away, but it never did. Every minute, there was a knock. It came periodically for thirty minutes before I got out of bed and walked over to the window. Despite the fact that I knew what I was going to see, I still stumbled back when I drew the curtains apart. There he was again. He was just about to knock again but put his arm back down when he saw me. I was waiting for him to do something, but he didn't. He just stood there, staring at me. It was just as unsettling as last time.\n\nFinally, I mustered up the courage to speak, “What the fuck do you want?”\n\nAt that he cocked his head to the side but did not respond.\n\n“What do you want?!” I was getting angry. It's exhausting living weeks in a state of fear, and here he was just staring at me. But even so, he didn’t respond, “Why are you here?!”\n\nFinally, it spoke, “For whatever purpose you need,” Its muffled voice came through the window, sending chills down my spine. It’s voice was no longer so monotone and sounded a lot more like mine.\n\n“I don’t need you for anything. Why are you here?”\n\n“I was created to serve whatever purpose you need,” It’s really creepy seeing my voice come from my emotionless face right in front of me.\n\n“I didn’t even want you! You were an accident because my goddamn mom bought that stupid box on a whim!” As I stared at it, it remained stone faced, “You want to help? Go! Leave me alone! Get rid of yourself! I don’t want you!”\n\nIt didn’t respond. After an awkward moment of silent staring, I closed the curtains. I didn’t go to bed that night, though I didn’t really try to. I stayed up, making sure that it didn’t try to enter my room. I didn’t hear any more footsteps, but when I opened the curtains in the morning, it was gone. I told Sam about it when he woke up. Neither of us felt watched anymore, though we were still on edge. We didn’t know what it was going to do with those instructions. I was really hoping it *would* get rid of itself. Two days later Ms. Watson told me that my mom was heading back home. She would be back by five, so she offered to drive me home. When it was time, we pulled up to the driveway but didn’t see her car. I assumed it was in the garage, said bye and went inside. My mom was already in her room, but she left my phone on the kitchen counter. I checked the house to make sure *he* wasn’t hiding anywhere, then went back to my room. My mom didn’t try to talk to me, so I supposed she was still upset, but I didn’t really care. I was mad at her as well. She got me into this damn situation, then left while I had to deal with it.\n\nMy life was pretty normal for a few days. I was still checking over my shoulder, but I didn’t see him again. I took the bus to school since mom was still ignoring me. We didn’t talk or even see each other for a few days. Then my aunt texted me.\n\n*Sheryl- Hey sweetie, can you tell your mom to call me back? She hasn’t been responding to me. Thanks!*\n\nI said yes and begrudgingly left my room, approaching my mom’s door. I knocked but got no response, “Mom?” I rolled my eyes. Either she was ignoring me or she had fallen asleep with the TV on. I knocked again and called out, but still got no response. I texted my aunt and told her my mom was asleep. Now, if I’m telling you about this then you know something’s wrong. And it was, but I didn’t know it at the time. By the seventh day of her ignoring me, I was starting to get weirded out. I hadn’t heard her leave her room, cook, or take anything from the fridge. I texted Sam and he immediately told me to check her room. So, I walked over, knocking just to be sure. When she didn’t answer, I swung open the door and was met with an empty room. My heart began to race, but I checked the garage before panicking. No car. Okay, maybe she wasn’t home. I texted her to ask where she was and thankfully received a response.\n\n*Mom- Getting groceries. I’m just down the street.*\n\nI sighed in relief and felt a little dumb. I walked outside and waited for her. Being scared that something had happened to her made me want to forget the whole argument we were having. And really, I was still coming down from the anxiety and needed to see that she was actually okay. After a few minutes of waiting outside, I saw her car turn the corner. I sighed out of relief and walked over to the sidewalk. The car rolled down the street, but as it did, I noticed that the front was dented. Had she gotten in a car accident? Since I was studying the damage on the car, I didn’t notice that she had sped up. Now the car was barreling down the street towards the house. Actually, I noticed, it was coming towards me. By the time I realized this I barely had enough time to jump out of the way before the car drove right over where I had been standing. There was a loud crack behind me as the mailbox was run over. I stared flabbergasted at the car as it continued down the street. Even after it disappeared around the corner, I stayed on the ground, my heart racing.\n\nWhat shook me out of it was when my phone rang. My hands shaking with adrenaline, I pulled it out of my pocket and glanced at the screen. It was my mom. I answered the call and held the phone to my ear. I could hear the sound of her driving in the background, but she didn’t say anything.\n\n“Hello?” I finally said, my voice a mix of annoyance and fear.\n\nThere was silence for a moment before my voice came through the phone, “You were an accident because my goddamn mom bought that stupid box on a whim!”\n\nI froze. It sounded exactly the same as when I had said it just a few days ago, “What the fuck…” He didn’t say anything else, “Where is my mom?!”\n\nHe didn’t respond. Instead, he ended the call. I stared down the street for a while before eventually getting up and rushing back inside. Obviously I considered calling the police, but what was I supposed to say? My clone tried to run me over and may have killed my mom? No. It took me a while to calm myself, but eventually I managed to think of a plan. I called my family to ensure they hadn’t seen her, which caused my aunt to panic. She was already in her car when she called to say she was staying with me until my mom was found. I had no objection and told her what I could when she said she was filing a missing persons report. I had to be selective about what I told her. I ended up saying that I hadn’t seen her since she left but that I saw her car, which looked dented and damaged. I was anxious and hoping that my mom was okay, but it definitely felt better knowing that there were people looking for her. And that I wouldn’t be alone. The only issue is that my aunt lived far away and I would be alone for the rest of the day.\n\nBy then it was late in the afternoon and the sun was starting to go down. I considered going to Sam’s place, but it was getting dark and I was scared that I would lead whoever or whatever this person is to them. Clearly he had become violent. I called Sam and told him what happened, and he told me to stay over until my aunt arrived. I wanted to, but by that point it was dark out and I felt like I was being watched again. Sam kept telling me to head to his house, but I didn’t feel safe going outside. I knew it was out there. I could hear it walking around.\n\nThen came the knock at the door, causing me to jump. My aunt wasn’t supposed to be here for another few hours. I checked through the peephole and didn’t see anyone. I grabbed a knife and drew the curtains, but I can still hear him walking around. My aunt will be here soon so I’m hoping he’ll go away once she arrives. But I’m also scared that he might hurt her. I can’t call her and say ‘there’s a clone of me that might hurt you,’ so I’m trying to figure out what to do. I’m hiding in my closet just to be safe, but I’m really hoping he doesn’t get inside. I wrote this out in case I get killed before my aunt arrives. If anyone knows what this thing is or how I can get rid of him, please help me. The knocking is getting louder and I think he’s trying to break the door down.",

It’s me again. \n\nFirst of all, wow. I didn’t expect this sort of response.\n\nThanks for all the great feedback on my previous post. Honestly, I wasn’t sure how interested anyone would be in some of the things going on out here, and I was more than a little surprised when I got back to my cabin yesterday and saw all the responses. Before I get rolling with some more experiences I’ve had out here, I just wanted to address a few questions or comments that folks have made on my last update.\n\nSomeone suggested that I should try to capture the *shades* with my camera. That’s a good suggestion, and I’ve already tried that on a couple of occasions. The issue I’ve run into is that, because of the darkness and the snow, I only really have two options: either use a flash or some other light source, or else use a long shutter speed on my cameras. Even though I was pretty sure neither one would work, I have actually tried both methods.\n\nUnfortunately, as anyone who has driven in a snowstorm can attest, snow is great at reflecting light, which is why you can’t use your high beams when driving in it – the light just reflects off the snow and back into your eyes, effectively blinding you. My results using this method were about what you’d expect – nothing but a complete white-out of the captured images. Using a slow shutter speed didn’t yield any better results; all I got were images of completely incomprehensible motion blurs. I suppose there are probably better camera rigs out there that may be able to overcome these challenges, but I don’t know of them. Even if they do exist, they’re probably well outside of my budget. The National Parks Service doesn’t exactly pay seasonal caretakers in gold bullion.\n\nThere was also a concern that, even though I’m trying to remain anonymous, I’ve given away enough details about myself that my employers could easily identify me. Don’t worry about that – firstly, there are more than twenty national parks in Alaska, covering over fifty million acres of land. Believe it or not, it actually contains the majority of the national park land in the entire United States – something like 65% of it. As you can imagine, there are a lot of folks spread across the state doing similar jobs to mine. It’s hard to envision exactly how expansive Alaska is and how much of it is covered with stark wilderness unless you’ve been here and seen it for yourself. I know that I didn’t have the faintest clue before I got here from the lower-48. I guess the bottom line is that it’s pretty unlikely that anyone from the NPS will be able to identify me from what I’ve told you about myself. If they do, I guess we’ll cross that bridge then.\n\nFinally, someone asked about the license plates on some of the vehicles that mysteriously appear out here in the wilderness, and whether they were all from one area or from all over. I’ve previously mentioned that I tend to avoid them if I come across them anymore, but I can tell you that the first car I ran across – the BMW – had a European-style license plate on the front. I assumed at the time that it was just one of those trendy plates that folks in the US sometimes put on the front of their Europeans cars for decoration, but it’s possible that it was legitimately from somewhere in Europe. I’m not sure. I recall that it was white and blue, but beyond that, I don’t remember much about it. Of course, the bus that the ranger found had Texas plates on it, but I don’t know about any others. Sorry.\n\nOkay, so now that I’ve cleared those points up, let’s dive into some of the other things going on out here.\n\nSince I mentioned it in my previous post, I’ll start off with the bears.\n\nSo, you probably already know this, but Alaska has some of the largest and most dangerous bears in the entire world. Fortunately, the Kodiak and the Polar bear aren’t generally found inland up here, but we still have more than our fair share of Grizzlies and large Black bears, both of which are apex predators and will make quick work of the unwary or unprepared.\n\nNow, since my contract covers the colder winter months, most of these bears are hibernating during my time here. That being said, not all bears hibernate, especially if they’re in an area of plentiful food supply. Also, even when they are hibernating, they’ll still become active from time to time, so you definitely can’t let your guard down if you want to stay on this side of the grave. It's a pretty safe bet that anyone who works up here, especially alone, tends to carry a rifle as well as a large-caliber handgun whenever they’re outside of their cabin. I’m no exception to that. I carry a 45-70 lever-action over my shoulder and a .500 magnum revolver in a chest holster. \n\nAt first glance, it may seem like overkill. That is a tremendous amount of firepower, after all.\n\nHowever, the first time you catch a glimpse of a mama Grizzly with her cubs and realize that you’re looking at an 800 pound predator that can run you down in a heartbeat, you’ll start wondering why I don’t carry even more.\n\nThe reason I mention all this isn’t to give you the impression that they’re some sort of mythical monsters hiding behind every tree just waiting to pounce; only that they represent the top of the food chain up here – period. Nothing, and I mean nothing, short of a pack of starving wolves, will even threaten one, and even that’s only been documented on a handful of occasions. They’re massive, powerful, and aggressive, and if you live out in their territory and don’t keep your head on a swivel, you’re an idiot, and probably soon to be converted into bear shit.\n\nSo, all that being the case, I’m sure you’ll understand what it means when I tell you that *something* is killing big Grizzlies out here. I’m not talking about poachers or indigenous hunters or anything like that. I’m talking about *something*. As in, *not* humans and definitely not hungry wolves.\n\nBut let me back up a step. My first season up here as a winter caretaker was a hell of a learning experience. Just trying to figure out the necessary maintenance routines and learning to navigate around my area of responsibility was a little overwhelming. One day, I was returning from making my rounds out to one of the ranger stations that was shut down for the winter and ended up taking a wrong turn on the trail. By the time I realized my mistake, I was already a fair distance along the new path and wandering into unfamiliar territory. \n\nJust as I was getting ready to turn around and retrace my steps, I topped a rise and was suddenly faced with the unmistakable form of a Grizzly, not thirty feet along the path ahead and facing away from me. \n\nI’ve got to tell you – I almost pissed myself as I fumbled to unsling the rifle from my shoulder. It’s a damned good thing I didn’t actually need it at that moment, because I discovered to my dismay that I had stupidly slung my shoulder pack over top of the rifle sling, effectively trapping it against my body.\n\nStupidity and complacency are what get you killed out here, folks, and I could have been a perfect example of both at that moment.\n\nAs it turns out, the bear wasn’t moving. It was just standing there perfectly still, its hind quarters facing me, and I knew instinctively that something was wrong with it. Giving up on my rifle, I grabbed my handgun from its holster and cautiously approached the Grizzly, my eyes intent on the bear and prepared for the slightest hint of movement. The closer I got to it, though, the more I certain I became that it wasn’t going to suddenly lunge at me and give me a lesson on exactly where on the food chain I placed.\n\nHere's where it gets surreal. Before I got close to it, I had already recognized that it was dead. What I couldn’t explain was why it was still standing. \n\nIt had clearly been there a while, as there were no paw prints leading up to it in the snow and, as I rounded to the front of it, I could see the flesh around its muzzle was already starting to decompose and pull back from its skull. When I got a good look at it, I could also see that it was missing tufts of fur here and there. Despite all that, it was still standing, like it had died and just forgotten to fall down.\n\nI looked it over pretty closely, which was still an unnerving exercise, dead or not, but I couldn’t find any sort of wounds or blood that might indicate why it had died.\n\nIt was then that I realized a couple of things: firstly, that there were Grizzlies in the area that were active, and, secondly, nothing had scavenged the carcass. To say this is unusual is an understatement. Most of the top carnivores in this area, including wolves, wolverines, and foxes, supplement their diets by scavenging on carrion. The fact that this bear had died and remained completely intact wasn’t just perplexing; it was… *unnatural*.\n\nI reported the find to the ranger station and heard back later from Rick that there had been nearly a dozen other similar discoveries within that general area in the last two months. The NPS had even brought in some fancy zoological pathologists from Anchorage to figure out what had killed the bears. They spent two weeks in the field with the rangers examining the carcasses and then one morning they were just gone – they had apparently been abruptly recalled without so much as a ‘by your leave’. Immediately after that, the carcasses were destroyed, and the investigation shut down.\n\nA week later, a rushed and astonishingly brief report came back indicating, “death by natural predation – no further investigation indicated”. \n\n*Natural predation.* I’m not sure how a predator could have killed the bear I found without leaving a single mark on it or trace of blood, let alone somehow keep it standing upright after death and then deciding it wasn’t even going to feed on the kill.\n\nI call bullshit, and so did the rangers.\n\nRick told me his boss had tried to contact the pathologists for more information but was told that they had all been reassigned and were no longer working with the Parks Service. \n\nNot one to easily give up, Rick’s boss tried calling a private cell number he had gotten from one of the pathologists during their visit. It went to a disconnected message indicating the phone was no longer in service. This was strange, because he had just spoken to the investigator using that very number only a couple weeks prior, so he knew it was a good number.\n\nBut, late that night, he received a call from an unknown caller. When he answered it, he recognized the hushed voice of the pathologist he had befriended, sounding like they were whispering into their phone. \n\n“Leave it alone. Forget about it,” was all they said before the line went dead. He tried calling the number back several times, but it just went to dead air each time. That was the last time he heard anything about it. He tried following up within the NPS, but somehow nobody was able to find records that such an investigation had ever existed or even that any reports of the dead bears had been filed in the first place. \n\nRick told me that, for a while, it was all his boss wanted to talk about – it had become like a splinter in his hand that he couldn’t ignore. He called anyone he could think of in the chain of command at the NPS and any other agencies he thought might be able to provide some clue about what was going on but couldn’t make an inch of headway.\n\nThen, one day, he just stopped talking about it, like a switch had been thrown. One evening, Rick and his boss were having beers at a local bar after their shift and talking about how strange the whole thing was.\n\nAnd then the next morning, his boss walked in, looking a little shaky and out of sorts, went into his office and closed the door, and didn’t say two words to Rick that day. \n\nHe never mentioned the incident again. A few times Rick had brought it up in conversation with him later on and his boss just brushed the whole thing off and changed subjects, looking very uncomfortable about the whole thing.\n\nI don’t know what happened, but if I had to guess, I’m thinking that his boss was probably digging into something that wasn’t meant to be dug into, and someone had convinced him it was better if he just forgot about it.\n\nLook, I’m not some conspiracy theorist nutjob, okay? I just know that the whole thing stinks to high hell and I’ll just leave it at that.\n\nThe other thing I’ll tell you about today is what we call the Witch’s lodge. I’m not sure what it was originally – it’s really not much more than a single-room log cabin built out in the deep bush. I’ve seen it a couple of times and been inside once. It’s a bit of a hike from my post and not somewhere easily traveled, even by snowmobile, so I don’t get out that way very often.\n\nOld, abandoned cabins aren’t really that unusual up here. You’ll trip across them from time to time, although most aren’t much more than a few walls and a collapsed roof after the years and harsh Alaskan winters get through with them.\n\nThe Witch’s lodge is a little different, though. As far as I’m aware, nobody’s lived there for long time, but whoever built it must have known what they were doing, because it looks every bit as solid and maintained as my own cabin. I’m not even sure how it got its name, honestly – I just know that’s how it was introduced to me the first time, so that’s how I’m introducing it to you.\n\nA couple of years ago, my ranger buddy, Rick, radioed me up asking if I wouldn’t mind joining him in a search for a couple of missing hikers – a father and his twelve-year-old son. I’m just a caretaker – I don’t normally participate in ranger or search-and-rescue related activities, but apparently there wasn’t anyone else available to accompany him on that day, and he had gotten a lead that the hikers may have been heading out into my section of the park. In S&amp;R efforts, especially during the dark Alaska winters, finding someone quickly is critical if you want to find them alive, so he wanted to follow up on it sooner than later.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t exactly refuse to help him, especially not when one of them was just a kid. So, a couple hours later, I found myself trailing behind him through the knee-deep snow. We moved along a semi-familiar path for a while before he turned left at a fork, and we started making our way along another that I wasn’t familiar with. He seemed like he knew where he was headed, like he had a particular destination in mind, though, and we really didn’t talk much during the hike. We stopped a couple times to rest and sip some hot coffee from our thermoses, but even then, we were both quiet. I think there was some sort of dark cloud hanging over his mood – I could see it in his narrowed eyes and drawn brow. It was infectious, and soon started manifesting itself in the back of my own mind.\n\nAn hour later, we came upon the place. I was surprised to see this perfectly preserved little cedar log cabin, just sitting out here among the trees and looking for all the world like someone would come walking out of the front door at any moment.\n\nSomething about the place seemed off, though. Somehow, I knew that nobody lived there – that nobody had lived there in a long time. I can’t explain it, but at that moment, I had this strange feeling that we weren’t welcome here, like something was telling me to turn around and head back while I still could.\n\nBefore I had the chance to open my mouth about it, Rick turned to me and pointed towards the closed front door, where I could clearly see the boot prints at its threshold. \n\n“Come on,” he said over the wind that had just blown up, and I could see the grim set to his expression before he turned away from me and started making his way towards the door.\n\nI noticed that he had drawn his handgun, so I did the same, though I had no idea why. We reached the entryway to the cabin, and he put his hand on the latch. Before he lifted it, he paused and looked back at me with that same dark expression.\n\n“We’re going to have to look inside,” he said. “If there’s nothing to be found in there, fine. We’ll just turn around and head back to your cabin for a couple glasses of whiskey by the fire. Maybe the other groups will find them, then.” His eyes fixed hard on mine, like he wanted to make sure I was paying damned good attention to him. “But if we find anyone other than this idiot hiker and his kid inside, we’re not going look at them and we’re not going to say a single word to them, understand? Even if they talk to us first.”\n\nI nodded at him, more confused than anything else, but that wasn’t good enough.\n\n“I need you to say it, John, to make sure you understand what I’m telling you,” he said, and the set of his eyes was so serious and determined that I repeated his instructions back to him without a second thought. When I did, he gave a brief nod and lifted the latch, pushing the door inward.\n\nWe stepped through the doorway into the darkened room beyond. As soon as we did, I was overwhelmed by the stench of decay, mixed with the strong scents of herbs and something else, something sickly riding just under the surface of all that.\n\nMy eyes had just started to adjust to the dim light of the interior, and I was able to make out the sparse furnishings of the room – an old rickety table with a solitary low-backed chair in front of a cold stone fireplace. Along the far wall, I thought I could just make out a cot, but I couldn’t be sure. \n\n“*Dammit. It’s happened again*,” Rick said, almost under his breath, and the tone of warning in his voice drew my attention immediately. I turned to find him kneeling next to the desiccated husk of a man’s body, dressed in gray snowpants and a red down jacket, slumped back against the wall. It looked like it had been there for years, and I stumbled backwards in shock without realizing it.\n\n“*What the shit?*” I exclaimed, not really knowing what else to say.\n\nRick picked up something that was resting on the floor near the man’s skeletal hand, looked around briefly at the room, and then nodded to the door. “Time to go. I’ll let the S&amp;R team know that we found the hikers,” he said.\n\nI was more than a little confused. The body we were looking at was almost mummified – it had clearly been there a long time, and I told him as much. Not to mention the fact that there was only one of them; if it was possible that this *was* the father, that still meant that the son was somewhere out here.\n\n“It’s too late, John,” was all he said, pressing something into my hands as he passed me and stepped out the door. I looked down and realized I was holding a small notebook, like the kind a person might keep in their pocket just in case they needed to write something down. \n\nNumbly, I flipped it open. It was mostly empty, except for the first two pages, which were scrawled in a sloppy cursive in pencil. I don’t have it anymore, so this is going to be as well as I remember it, but it should be close enough that you get the gist of it:\n\n*We found her cabin. God, I wish we hadn’t. Nathan’s gone – she took him. I’ve been wandering around in here for days, but I can’t find my way out. I haven’t seen Nathan or her since that first day. My boy is gone!*\n\n*How can I not find my way out?*\n\n*What’s happening?*\n\n*I can hear her whispers taunting me, but it’s always just a little farther forward, around the next corner.*\n\n*I don’t understand any of this.*\n\n*I’m so sorry.*\n\nAs it turns out, we did end up heading back to my cabin. Rick radioed the S&amp;R team that he’d found the hikers in the *lodge*, and the person on the other end paused a long moment before replying with a simple acknowledgement.\n\nNo questions. \n\nNothing else.\n\nJust, “Acknowledged, Rick.”\n\nWe didn’t say much to each other that night. We just sat in front of my fire and drank the rest of my Jameson until we both passed out.\n\nWhen I returned to consciousness the next morning, Rick had already gotten up and left. \n\nWe haven’t spoken about it since that day. The notebook was gone when I awoke, so I assume he took that with him. Clearly, he knows something about what happened, about that cabin, but I’ve never asked him about it.\n\nI’m not too sure I really want to know. \n\nIt’s hard enough to sleep at night out here sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of which, I suppose it’s time for me to sign off and get some shut eye. It’s already almost 2AM and I’ve got a long day’s work ahead of me tomorrow. It snowed pretty good today, and I was already behind in clearing the roof of the storage sheds over near the old fire watch tower.\n\nI’d rather not have to deal with the damage if the roof collapses, so I’d better get over there as soon as it lets up some outside.\n\nI’ll write some more soon.\n\nGood night, all.\n\n [\\-&gt;.&lt;-](https://www.youtube.com/@dark_night_tales)",

        "text": "I wrote this on my WattPad: TheBigJ2001\n\n The day she died was the day my life was over. She was the love of my life and now that she's gone, I don't know what to do. Now I just walk the streets of Castle Rock, Colorado, depressed and unwilling to go on.\n\n    I'm walking along the sidewalk when an old man approaches me from an alleyway.  \n      \"Hello,\" he begins. \"You seem down about something. Tell me, friend, what's getting you down?\"  \n      \"My... wife... she died... a week ago,\" I answer. \"And now I don't know how to go on.\"  \n      \"Sorry,\" He apologizes.  \n      \"Don't be,\" I insist. \"I just wish there was a way to bring her back.\"  \n      \"Maybe there is,\" he catches my attention. \"There is legend of a hidden road that measures eleven miles long. Anyone with a wish or desire may take on the road to achieve there goal.\"  \n      \"What?\" I question. \"Can this road bring my wife back?\"  \n      \"Yes,\" he answers. \"It can bring any wish or desire to fruition. However, may you fail along the road, death shall be imminent and you will be stuck forever.\"  \n      I don't know if I should seek this road, but if I want my old life back, then I must.  \n      \"Where is this road?\" I ask.  \n      \"Those who seek the road shall find the road,\" he informs.  \n      \"Okay,\" I reply. \"Well... later, I guess.\"  \n      \"Before you go take this note,\" he insists. \"It'll prove a great help to you.\"  \n      \"I won't be needing it,\" I inform.  \n      \"Please, take it,\" he persists.  \n      I take the note, turn around, and look at it. I turn back around to ask him something.  \n      \"Wait, what is this for-\" he was gone.  \n      I look at the note. I crumble up the note and toss it on the ground.  \n      When I arrive home, I sit down on the couch and fall asleep while watching television.  \n      I wake up at eleven o'clock at night. I look at the endtable and... I see a note. I grab the note and look at it. It was the note from earlier ago. I decide to read it. It reads:\n\n\"Rules of the  \n11-Mile Road:\n\n1) Do not turn on the radio.  \n2)Do not use a cell phone.  \n3) Do not open the windows.  \n4) Do not go over thirty miles per hour.  \n5) Do not exit your vehicle under any circumstances.  \n6) Keep your eyes on the road at all times.  \n7) Buckle up.  \n8) Make sure your vehicle is fueled.  \n9) No going back after mile one.  \n10a) Don't look at them.  \n10b) Don't listen to them.  \n10c) Don't know them.  \n11) Do not turn around.  \n12) The lake can prove deadly to sight.  \n13) When it dies, revive it.  \n14) Do not look at Hell.\"  \n \n\n      Strange... some of the rules don't make any sense. I can't, but my wife. I guess I have no choice, I must go. After all, she would want me to.  \n      I drive along the uninhabited road, all alone, in solitude, with nobody around. Driving, I begin to notice rose peddles blowing in the wind. A sudden feeling of warmth fills my body. I arrive at two split roads. I don't remember the left one. I stop to think. No, I can't, but I must. I drive down the left road.  \n      After about five minutes, I look at the sky, it's... covered in stars. I could have sworn it was cloudy a while ago. All the sudden, I feel a drop in temperature. After checking with the rules, I turn on the heater. There are copious trees along the sides of the road.  \n      After about forty minutes, I notice dark figures in the trees. I check the rules:\n\n\"10a) Don't look at them.  \n10b) Don't listen to them.  \n10c) Don't know them.\"\n\n      I keep my eyes on the road and ignore the shadows. The temperature seems to be lowering as I continue.  \n \n\n    I've been driving for four miles now. I hear whispering. I can't figure out what they're saying. I ignore them. All the sudden, the trees disappear on the left side of the road... and appeared a lake with a great moon shining upon it. I quickly look away, remembering the rules.  \n      After I pass the lake, the trees continue. I notice the sky has gone dark, completely void of stars. Suddenly, my lights begin to flicker and I begin to hear my radio though I do not know what it says. It does, however sound similar to the voices. I ignore it.  \n      After about twenty minutes, the voices are back, but different. They sound like screaming in the distance, like their getting closer. All the sudden, I hear one of the voices speaking right behind me, as if in the backseat. I feel uneasy, uncomfortable, scared. I don't turn around and just keep driving. I... feel... so... c-cold, but I must keep driving. Suddenly, I hear screaming voices chasing me. I hear them hitting my car, trying to get in. This is scary. I'm freaking out. What the hell? Please... go away. All the sudden, my car stops. No, no, no! They begin to surround my car. I close my eyes shut. No, no, no! I want to go back! I hear them slamming on my car. I hear the windows cracking. No! I attempt to start my car and it starts. I slam the peddle and the shadows disperse. I open my eyes. Suddenly, it's quiet, peaceful, the shadows stand back, silent. This can't be the end, I'm only on mile ten. I enjoy the relaxing ride. All the sudden, my car stops running, but it's still moving. I see... I see a red light, I begin hearing the screaming voices louder than before. I quickly shut my eyes. I hear screaming, suffering, crying, it's too much. I cover my eyes with my hands. No. Stop. Stop! After twenty seconds, I open my eyes, unable to bare it any longer. I see Hell, it's everywhere!  \n      \"Ah!\" I yell. \"Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!\"  \n      The shadows overcrowd me and break into my car. I feel an immense amount of pain. It hurts. It hurts so much.  \n      I open my eyes, but it's dark, and all I see is nothing, but a car driving on the 11-mile road.\n\nTHE END",

        "text": "Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z991v3/im\\_investigating\\_a\\_missing\\_person\\_who\\_left\\_a/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z991v3/im_investigating_a_missing_person_who_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI’m the PI who’s been hired by the Franklin family to find their son. A little more than 3 years ago, Alexander went missing in the northern Ontario wilderness. His case officially went two months ago.\n\nThe last ping Alex’s cell phone made was off one of the few cell towers in the area when a file was uploaded onto a private forum at 11:13 P.M. There have been no new leads or information on Alex’s whereabouts since.\n\nThe post made by Alex was a written account of a car crash in which he was involved. He was driving along the remote highway to a nearby town for medical services when the accident occurred. Alex alleges that the trucker involved was drunk, and began to chase Alex through the surrounding forest, brandishing a machete.\n\nThe post continues with Alex describing a mysterious cave he discovers after some time running from his pursuer he labeled as, Camo (in reference to the trucker’s camouflage apparel). After an unexplained encounter involving both parties and the cave, which is described as a “vacuum” in the Earth, Alex returned to the highway alone and sometime later was picked up by a local, Margo Coon.\n\nAlex’s narrative ends ominously soon after this. It is assumed that shortly after this Alex and Margo were taken.\n\nThe individual referred to as Camo was identified by police investigation. His real name is Barry Campbell, part-time trucker, trailer park resident, and local menace. The cops stopped investigating his disappearance, since no one really pushed too hard to try and find him. They assumed he had gotten lost there, death by exposure and/or eaten by animals.\n\nI’ve now had the chance to talk to Margo’s husband, Don, who lives in Thunderbay, a small city roughly 150 kilometers (approx. 90 miles) from Alex and Margo’s last estimated location.\n\nDon told me that Margo was on her way back from her caretaking job at another cabin in a nearby location. He said that Margo had agreed with him when she first started that if the long drive back couldn’t be made by sunset, she would spend the night at her employer’s cabin, and undertake the journey in the morning.\n\nAccording to Don, people familiar with the territory and its history know never to be out in those sprawling forests after dark. If forced to drive the lengthy and secluded highways of the region in the night, it’s advised to reach your destination as quickly as possible, paying no mind to speed limit.\n\nYou won’t find any law enforcement out there after dark. There’s an understanding between them and the locals about the bush: “When that sun goes down, it’s no-man’s land.”\n\nDon added that visitors to the area looking to camp are a large contributor to the missing person statistic in the province. Entire campsites have been found undisturbed, tents and grills standing, cars still parked nearby, and yet not a soul to be found; search parties having returned empty handed after weeks of fruitless efforts.\n\nThis information seems to follow the same theme as Alex’s post and could provide a semblance of an explanation to his cryptic final words,\n\n“Don’t come looking for me…”\n\nCurious.\n\nI arrived at Thunderbay two days ago, settling into a cheap motel near the downtown area. I paid the girl behind the counter for a week’s lodging. The city rests, tucked away along the shores of Lake Superior and beyond its limits lies endless miles of forest.\n\nAfter unloading my belongings in my room, I went about setting up my workstation. I sat at the hotel-provided desk and looked through the information I had in my possession.\n\nOne thing that interested me was the time Alexander’s post was uploaded. 11:13 PM, even though in his post Alex claims it was a little after sunset. Why is there such a time discrepancy? Did Alex upload it himself?\n\nNot only this, but I was able to find the Franklin’s cabin that Alex was staying at on a map. Alex claimed he was on his way to Atikokan, the nearest town. The remains of the automobile wreck, both Alex's Sentra and Barry's truck, was found about 20 minutes outside of Atikokan. Yet, the cell tower that recorded Alex’s phone activity is in the opposite direction of Atikokan from Alex’s cabin. In fact, approximately 30 miles in the opposite direction.\n\nWhile it is possible Margo could’ve driven Alex there, why would she do that? Atikoken is the nearest town for miles, and as Don said before, Margo knew it was ill-advised to be out there that late at night.\n\nAfter a personal briefing in my hotel room, I drove to Don’s home, stopping at an A&amp;W on the way. I wish they had more of them in the U.S. I’m a sucker for their foamy root beer.\n\nDon didn’t have much else to offer besides the information I mentioned above. I knocked on his door and let myself in after he barked sharply from inside that, “it’ll take longer for me to come to you than the other way around.\n\nWhen I walked into his living room, Don was resting in a rocking chair, pushing off the floorboards softly with his feet so he swayed ever so slightly with the chair. Looking to be in his 60’s and overweight, he gestured with his left hand to sit while his right hand gripped the head of a seemingly homemade cane.\n\nPerching myself on the couch across from him, after initial pleasantries, Don began to ramble to me. He seemed scatterbrained and nervous. Going on tangents about Margo and how he never really wanted her to work that far out, but that money was tight and his disabilities prevented him from working. She was employed by a family friend which was another reason she took the job.\n\nAfter some more anxious speak, I realized speaking further with him would be useless and decided to leave the man alone as he was obviously still grieving. I'd circle back if need be.\n\nIt was getting late but I decided I’d have enough time to pursue one final lead.\n\nAfter a 20-minute drive I arrived at the city's edge. A logging factory rose above the horizon, blocking out the sun as it began to dip into the Earth. Colossal shadows from the towering piles of pulp adjacent to the building, stretched across and blanketed the large but mostly empty parking lot.\n\nI parked near the entrance to the factory and exited the car, strode into twilight and eventually through the closed front doors.\n\nThe interior wasn’t large but various pieces of machinery lined the floor with a few men stationed at each. I was supposed to meet Alan, an acquaintance I’d made in a previous investigation, who just so happened to be working at this location.\n\nI had the chance to glance around for a few seconds before a man holding a clipboard quickly marched over to me, asking my business. After giving the stout man Alan’s name, he told me stay put while he went to find him.\n\nI had about 5 seconds of alone time before I felt tugging on the back of my shirt.\n\nA big advocate of personal space, I turned around, and apprehensively stepped backwards.\n\nI looked down and saw a child, close enough to me that if he opened his jaw he’d get a mouthful of my jacket. At least I thought it was a little boy.\n\nThe figure, about belly height to me (I’m 5 foot 10 inches for reference) wore a hard hat that currently covered their face and sported a bright neon purple vest over a hoodie that stretched past their knees.\n\nA tiny, pale hand found the brim of the hard hat and titled it upwards exposing a toothy smile on the face of a middle-aged woman. This unsettled me for reasons I couldn’t place until now. Her body was so unnaturally small. Not like a midget’s though, but like an actual 8-year-old child’s. For anyone interested in unique metaphors, it looked as though a kid’s head got trapped in a time machine that fast forward it about 40 years into the future.\n\nLike I said. Slightly disturbing is an understatement.\n\nUnder my breath, I may have said something along the lines of, “Ugh, what the fuc-“, but the lady-child cut me off, not caring to hear the rest of my thoughts.\n\n“Watcha lookin for?” The small woman asked inquisitively.\n\n“Uh,” I pointed towards the interior of the factory. “Meeting a friend… Who –”\n\n“No, you’re not.” The little lady cut me off with this statement.\n\nI was still a little unsettled and now for some reason had nervous energy building up in my arms, legs, and chest. Who was this and how did she appear out of nowhere, literally an inch away from me without my noticing? Thinking about it though, being caught unaware must’ve been a result of her abnormal height and the noise that the factory produced.\n\n“WATCHA lookin for. Not, WHO ya looking for.” She smiled again at me. “It’s okay though. I think I know.”\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked uncertainly. I was feeling more and more certain that this individual had some mental issues.\n\n“I’m Silly. I like purple, snow, and King Kong.” She raised both arms in the air as she said this and jumped. The hoodies long sleeves went past her hands and flopped around making Silly look like an inflatable in front of a car wash. My anxiety began to dissipate watching her arms flail about.\n\nI chuckled lightly and bent down. “Well, Silly, ‘watcha’ think I’m looking for then.”\n\nShe fixed me with a blank stare.\n\n“King Kong.”\n\nI hesitated suddenly uneasy again.\n\nShe gestured for me to get closer, and whispered, “I have something to tell you about King Kong.”\n\nSilly’s mouth opened, but her eyes left mine for a brief second, focusing behind me. I looked and saw the man with the clipboard from before marching over from across the factory floor, with a greasy looking Alan in tow.\n\nI turned back and Silly was gradually edging away from me.\n\n“Got somewhere to be?”\n\nSilly nodded solemnly and before slipping around a corner I heard her utter something under her breath. She was just barely in earshot, and the noises of the factory added to my difficulty in hearing what she said, but after picking through my memory I’m almost positive this is what Silly muttered:\n\n“*Should’ve just said they found King Kong. All the credit. And a lot less dead people.”*\n\nIn the moment I didn’t have time to process what I heard, and as Silly slinked out of view, Alan’s booming voice rose over the clanking and grinding music that the machinery produced.\n\n“We oughta fire whoever let this guy in, eh?”\n\nI smiled and after a snarky comeback, a handshake, and a hug Alan led me to his office.\n\n“So, you finished hibernating underground and decided to rejoin the land of the living,” I joked as I plopped into a chair. Alan grabbed a bottle of bourbon and 2 glasses from a cabinet on the back wall.\n\n“A brief hiatus. The mines still pay better, but if I got time, I can manage both. They’re the same job position anyway so nothing too complicated.” Alan sat behind his desk and poured the liquor. “I see you’re still working the same old, eh?”\n\nI shrugged. “I like getting paid to do something I’m good at… and enjoy.”\n\n“I forgot how stupid you were. After what we found in that mine, I’d have guessed retirement was in store for you.” Alan slid my drink across the desk towards me, leaned back and swallowed the contents of his glass in one big gulp.\n\nI sipped mine leisurely and winced. “I could say the exact same to you. Yet here we sit.”\n\nWe both smiled and were silent for a minute. And then I began to tell him why I was here.\n\nAlan’s a good listener and he waited for me to finish dumping information on him. I trust Alan. He’s a native of the area, and his work ensures that he knows the province extremely well.\n\nWhile working at a mine near Toronto, miners accidentally broke through a wall into the city's underground waterways and sewer system. Soon after, miners began finding unnatural carvings that nobody admitted to making and hearing what sounded like animal noises from the deeper tunnels, which at times would actually echo throughout the mines. When one of his men went missing while on a routine rock dusting task in plain view of three others, Alan scoured the internet and eventually found me.\n\nIt ended up being a type of water spirit from Algonquian mythology, angered by the rivers and creeks of the city being placed under the ground. When the miners broke through into the subterranean labyrinth, the nymph manifested some type of beast that wreaked havoc throughout the mine.\n\nWhat a pain in the ass that was.\n\nAfter I wrapped up all the main points of Alex’s case, Alan finally spoke.\n\n“I actually know Don personally,” he said, shaking his head. “Never been the same since Margo disappeared. And I know those woods too. That land has a nickname here at the company.”\n\nAlan began rummaging through some drawers in his desk and pulled out a couple of books that he flipped through. He stopped on a page before spinning it around for me and tapping on a graph that was printed on it.\n\nThe logging company had the Ontario province split into sections, which they labeled as zones. The graph held data on each zone: how much timber was collected, how often timber was collected, average money made from logging each zone, the majority tree type found in each zone, amount of men needed to work each zone, etc.\n\nMy eyes traced down the graph. *White Zone, Bay Zone, Southern Superior Zone, Northern Zone*…. In the last row of the graph were pen and pencil scribble marks crossing out the name of the last zone. Written underneath it in red pen were two words. *DEAD ZONE.*\n\n“Big Stephen King fan huh?” I spoke not looking up from the book.\n\nAlan held his hands up defensively.\n\n“That’s how it came to me.”\n\nI looked along the row labeled *DEAD ZONE* and saw some… strange statistics.\n\nEvery other zone was logged on average every 15-30 years. The last year the Dead Zone was cleared through was recorded as 1840. There were no numbers recorded for how much timber was collected and how much money was made on average in this zone, but the last two boxes in the row puzzled me.\n\nMost Common Tree Species: *Rot*\n\nMen Necessary for Zone Clearance: *7*\n\nI looked up at Alan.\n\n“How the hell do seven men clear hundreds of miles of woods?”\n\nAlan finished pouring another drink into his glass before he answered simply, “They don’t.”\n\nAnother swig and the liquor disappeared from his glass. Encouraged by my silence, he continued.\n\n“It should say on there the last time they completely cleared those woods was sometime in the 1800s, but the last time we tried was in 2020.”\n\n“Tried?” I asked.\n\nAlan clarified.\n\nWhile 1840 was the last time the company completely cleared the dead zone, they replaced their routine deforestation with a seven-man crew sent every twenty years to cut down a few dozen trees. The reason being that the timber collected from the dead zone would wither to its core roughly 24-48 hours after it was chopped down. Since the company's creation, this peculiar phenomenon had occurred every time the area was logged.\n\nAccording to workplace legend, the wood was taken to an arborist to be studied. The arborist spent no more than a minute analyzing the wood before he asked the logger, “Where’d you find this?”\n\nAfter the company man answered they had cut it down two days ago, the arborist looked at him with a puzzled expression before replying.\n\n“This is fossilized wood. It’s been dead for centuries.”\n\nI left the factory soon after. Preceding my departure, I asked Alan how many people knew. He said that everyone in the logging company did, and that the vast majority of the locals at nearby towns and some in the city had at least a rudimentary knowledge of the urban legends about the area.\n\nWhen asked about Silly, Alan told me that she was hired through some program and had been working there longer than him. I made a note to come back and talk with Silly. She seemed to know something about the area, and I am curious about what she had planned to tell me before we were interrupted.\n\nI also plan on visiting the trailer park that Barry Campbell resided in. A few questions to friends and family might clear up a few things.\n\nAfter a bit of convincing, Alan agreed to let me borrow some of the logging company’s books containing records, data, and other information for a couple days. I’m in my hotel room again now. Tomorrow, I plan to enter the dead zone. I need to confirm Alex’s last known location and, if possible, find the cave he mentions. Alan offered to drive out there with me so at least I won’t be alone.\n\nWe aren’t going in unarmed. I understand the dangers of my job and the things I encounter as a result. I’m confident that I’ll be ready for whatever waits, and hopefully find Alex. Or at least find a better explanation for his disappearance.\n\nI’m not certain exactly what may have had a part in Alex’s disappearance so if any of you have any ideas, please share. From what I’ve read and heard from others, the closest thing it can be compared to is a Wendigo. Annoying shits, and deadly too, but manageable if you know what you're dealing with. But that doesn’t explain the queer characteristics of the dead zone. Just as well, the characteristics mentioned in Alex's post doesn't align with those of a Wendigo...\n\nI will admit, this is the first case that I've worked in some time where I feel I am going into it, blind. The evidence available, feels like a few pages out of a Sherlock Holmes novel. In fact, I'm starting to feel like a proper detective. I hope I'm just imagining my ignorance to be in my head. Still, I will continue cautiously.\n\nI’ll update you guys again when I return from this trip.\n\nHappy Holidays.\n\n\\-JT",

His case officially went two months ago.\n\nThe last ping Alex’s cell phone made was off one of the few cell towers in the area when a file was uploaded onto a private forum at 11:13 P.M. There have been no new leads or information on Alex’s whereabouts since.\n\nThe post made by Alex was a written account of a car crash in which he was involved. He was driving along the remote highway to a nearby town for medical services when the accident occurred. Alex alleges that the trucker involved was drunk, and began to chase Alex through the surrounding forest, brandishing a machete.\n\nThe post continues with Alex describing a mysterious cave he discovers after some time running from his pursuer he labeled as, Camo (in reference to the trucker’s camouflage apparel). After an unexplained encounter involving both parties and the cave, which is described as a “vacuum” in the Earth, Alex returned to the highway alone and sometime later was picked up by a local, Margo Coon.\n\nAlex’s narrative ends ominously soon after this. It is assumed that shortly after this Alex and Margo were taken.\n\nThe individual referred to as Camo was identified by police investigation. His real name is Barry Campbell, part-time trucker, trailer park resident, and local menace. The cops stopped investigating his disappearance, since no one really pushed too hard to try and find him. They assumed he had gotten lost there, death by exposure and/or eaten by animals.\n\nI’ve now had the chance to talk to Margo’s husband, Don, who lives in Thunderbay, a small city roughly 150 kilometers (approx. 90 miles) from Alex and Margo’s last estimated location.\n\nDon told me that Margo was on her way back from her caretaking job at another cabin in a nearby location. He said that Margo had agreed with him when she first started that if the long drive back couldn’t be made by sunset, she would spend the night at her employer’s cabin, and undertake the journey in the morning.\n\nAccording to Don, people familiar with the territory and its history know never to be out in those sprawling forests after dark. If forced to drive the lengthy and secluded highways of the region in the night, it’s advised to reach your destination as quickly as possible, paying no mind to speed limit.\n\nYou won’t find any law enforcement out there after dark. There’s an understanding between them and the locals about the bush: “When that sun goes down, it’s no-man’s land.”\n\nDon added that visitors to the area looking to camp are a large contributor to the missing person statistic in the province. Entire campsites have been found undisturbed, tents and grills standing, cars still parked nearby, and yet not a soul to be found; search parties having returned empty handed after weeks of fruitless efforts.\n\nThis information seems to follow the same theme as Alex’s post and could provide a semblance of an explanation to his cryptic final words,\n\n“Don’t come looking for me…”\n\nCurious.\n\nI arrived at Thunderbay two days ago, settling into a cheap motel near the downtown area. I paid the girl behind the counter for a week’s lodging. The city rests, tucked away along the shores of Lake Superior and beyond its limits lies endless miles of forest.\n\nAfter unloading my belongings in my room, I went about setting up my workstation. I sat at the hotel-provided desk and looked through the information I had in my possession.\n\nOne thing that interested me was the time Alexander’s post was uploaded. 11:13 PM, even though in his post Alex claims it was a little after sunset. Why is there such a time discrepancy? Did Alex upload it himself?\n\nNot only this, but I was able to find the Franklin’s cabin that Alex was staying at on a map. Alex claimed he was on his way to Atikokan, the nearest town. The remains of the automobile wreck, both Alex's Sentra and Barry's truck, was found about 20 minutes outside of Atikokan. Yet, the cell tower that recorded Alex’s phone activity is in the opposite direction of Atikokan from Alex’s cabin. In fact, approximately 30 miles in the opposite direction.\n\nWhile it is possible Margo could’ve driven Alex there, why would she do that? Atikoken is the nearest town for miles, and as Don said before, Margo knew it was ill-advised to be out there that late at night.\n\nAfter a personal briefing in my hotel room, I drove to Don’s home, stopping at an A&amp;W on the way. I wish they had more of them in the U.S. I’m a sucker for their foamy root beer.\n\nDon didn’t have much else to offer besides the information I mentioned above. I knocked on his door and let myself in after he barked sharply from inside that, “it’ll take longer for me to come to you than the other way around.\n\nWhen I walked into his living room, Don was resting in a rocking chair, pushing off the floorboards softly with his feet so he swayed ever so slightly with the chair. Looking to be in his 60’s and overweight, he gestured with his left hand to sit while his right hand gripped the head of a seemingly homemade cane.\n\nPerching myself on the couch across from him, after initial pleasantries, Don began to ramble to me. He seemed scatterbrained and nervous. Going on tangents about Margo and how he never really wanted her to work that far out, but that money was tight and his disabilities prevented him from working. She was employed by a family friend which was another reason she took the job.\n\nAfter some more anxious speak, I realized speaking further with him would be useless and decided to leave the man alone as he was obviously still grieving. I'd circle back if need be.\n\nIt was getting late but I decided I’d have enough time to pursue one final lead.\n\nAfter a 20-minute drive I arrived at the city's edge. A logging factory rose above the horizon, blocking out the sun as it began to dip into the Earth. Colossal shadows from the towering piles of pulp adjacent to the building, stretched across and blanketed the large but mostly empty parking lot.\n\nI parked near the entrance to the factory and exited the car, strode into twilight and eventually through the closed front doors.\n\nThe interior wasn’t large but various pieces of machinery lined the floor with a few men stationed at each. I was supposed to meet Alan, an acquaintance I’d made in a previous investigation, who just so happened to be working at this location.\n\nI had the chance to glance around for a few seconds before a man holding a clipboard quickly marched over to me, asking my business. After giving the stout man Alan’s name, he told me stay put while he went to find him.\n\nI had about 5 seconds of alone time before I felt tugging on the back of my shirt.\n\nA big advocate of personal space, I turned around, and apprehensively stepped backwards.\n\nI looked down and saw a child, close enough to me that if he opened his jaw he’d get a mouthful of my jacket. At least I thought it was a little boy.\n\nThe figure, about belly height to me (I’m 5 foot 10 inches for reference) wore a hard hat that currently covered their face and sported a bright neon purple vest over a hoodie that stretched past their knees.\n\nA tiny, pale hand found the brim of the hard hat and titled it upwards exposing a toothy smile on the face of a middle-aged woman. This unsettled me for reasons I couldn’t place until now. Her body was so unnaturally small. Not like a midget’s though, but like an actual 8-year-old child’s. For anyone interested in unique metaphors, it looked as though a kid’s head got trapped in a time machine that fast forward it about 40 years into the future.\n\nLike I said. Slightly disturbing is an understatement.\n\nUnder my breath, I may have said something along the lines of, “Ugh, what the fuc-“, but the lady-child cut me off, not caring to hear the rest of my thoughts.\n\n“Watcha lookin for?” The small woman asked inquisitively.\n\n“Uh,” I pointed towards the interior of the factory. “Meeting a friend… Who –”\n\n“No, you’re not.” The little lady cut me off with this statement.\n\nI was still a little unsettled and now for some reason had nervous energy building up in my arms, legs, and chest. Who was this and how did she appear out of nowhere, literally an inch away from me without my noticing? Thinking about it though, being caught unaware must’ve been a result of her abnormal height and the noise that the factory produced.\n\n“WATCHA lookin for. Not, WHO ya looking for.” She smiled again at me. “It’s okay though. I think I know.”\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked uncertainly. I was feeling more and more certain that this individual had some mental issues.\n\n“I’m Silly. I like purple, snow, and King Kong.” She raised both arms in the air as she said this and jumped. The hoodies long sleeves went past her hands and flopped around making Silly look like an inflatable in front of a car wash. My anxiety began to dissipate watching her arms flail about.\n\nI chuckled lightly and bent down. “Well, Silly, ‘watcha’ think I’m looking for then.”\n\nShe fixed me with a blank stare.\n\n“King Kong.”\n\nI hesitated suddenly uneasy again.\n\nShe gestured for me to get closer, and whispered, “I have something to tell you about King Kong.”\n\nSilly’s mouth opened, but her eyes left mine for a brief second, focusing behind me. I looked and saw the man with the clipboard from before marching over from across the factory floor, with a greasy looking Alan in tow.\n\nI turned back and Silly was gradually edging away from me.\n\n“Got somewhere to be?”\n\nSilly nodded solemnly and before slipping around a corner I heard her utter something under her breath. She was just barely in earshot, and the noises of the factory added to my difficulty in hearing what she said, but after picking through my memory I’m almost positive this is what Silly muttered:\n\n“*Should’ve just said they found King Kong. All the credit. And a lot less dead people.”*\n\nIn the moment I didn’t have time to process what I heard, and as Silly slinked out of view, Alan’s booming voice rose over the clanking and grinding music that the machinery produced.\n\n“We oughta fire whoever let this guy in, eh?”\n\nI smiled and after a snarky comeback, a handshake, and a hug Alan led me to his office.\n\n“So, you finished hibernating underground and decided to rejoin the land of the living,” I joked as I plopped into a chair. Alan grabbed a bottle of bourbon and 2 glasses from a cabinet on the back wall.\n\n“A brief hiatus. The mines still pay better, but if I got time, I can manage both. They’re the same job position anyway so nothing too complicated.” Alan sat behind his desk and poured the liquor. “I see you’re still working the same old, eh?”\n\nI shrugged. “I like getting paid to do something I’m good at… and enjoy.”\n\n“I forgot how stupid you were. After what we found in that mine, I’d have guessed retirement was in store for you.” Alan slid my drink across the desk towards me, leaned back and swallowed the contents of his glass in one big gulp.\n\nI sipped mine leisurely and winced. “I could say the exact same to you. Yet here we sit.”\n\nWe both smiled and were silent for a minute. And then I began to tell him why I was here.\n\nAlan’s a good listener and he waited for me to finish dumping information on him. I trust Alan. He’s a native of the area, and his work ensures that he knows the province extremely well.\n\nWhile working at a mine near Toronto, miners accidentally broke through a wall into the city's underground waterways and sewer system. Soon after, miners began finding unnatural carvings that nobody admitted to making and hearing what sounded like animal noises from the deeper tunnels, which at times would actually echo throughout the mines. When one of his men went missing while on a routine rock dusting task in plain view of three others, Alan scoured the internet and eventually found me.\n\nIt ended up being a type of water spirit from Algonquian mythology, angered by the rivers and creeks of the city being placed under the ground. When the miners broke through into the subterranean labyrinth, the nymph manifested some type of beast that wreaked havoc throughout the mine.\n\nWhat a pain in the ass that was.\n\nAfter I wrapped up all the main points of Alex’s case, Alan finally spoke.\n\n“I actually know Don personally,” he said, shaking his head. “Never been the same since Margo disappeared. And I know those woods too. That land has a nickname here at the company.”\n\nAlan began rummaging through some drawers in his desk and pulled out a couple of books that he flipped through. He stopped on a page before spinning it around for me and tapping on a graph that was printed on it.\n\nThe logging company had the Ontario province split into sections, which they labeled as zones. The graph held data on each zone: how much timber was collected, how often timber was collected, average money made from logging each zone, the majority tree type found in each zone, amount of men needed to work each zone, etc.\n\nMy eyes traced down the graph. *White Zone, Bay Zone, Southern Superior Zone, Northern Zone*…. In the last row of the graph were pen and pencil scribble marks crossing out the name of the last zone. Written underneath it in red pen were two words. *DEAD ZONE.*\n\n“Big Stephen King fan huh?” I spoke not looking up from the book.\n\nAlan held his hands up defensively.\n\n“That’s how it came to me.”\n\nI looked along the row labeled *DEAD ZONE* and saw some… strange statistics.\n\nEvery other zone was logged on average every 15-30 years. The last year the Dead Zone was cleared through was recorded as 1840. There were no numbers recorded for how much timber was collected and how much money was made on average in this zone, but the last two boxes in the row puzzled me.\n\nMost Common Tree Species: *Rot*\n\nMen Necessary for Zone Clearance: *7*\n\nI looked up at Alan.\n\n“How the hell do seven men clear hundreds of miles of woods?”\n\nAlan finished pouring another drink into his glass before he answered simply, “They don’t.”\n\nAnother swig and the liquor disappeared from his glass. Encouraged by my silence, he continued.\n\n“It should say on there the last time they completely cleared those woods was sometime in the 1800s, but the last time we tried was in 2020.”\n\n“Tried?” I asked.\n\nAlan clarified.\n\nWhile 1840 was the last time the company completely cleared the dead zone, they replaced their routine deforestation with a seven-man crew sent every twenty years to cut down a few dozen trees. The reason being that the timber collected from the dead zone would wither to its core roughly 24-48 hours after it was chopped down. Since the company's creation, this peculiar phenomenon had occurred every time the area was logged.\n\nAccording to workplace legend, the wood was taken to an arborist to be studied. The arborist spent no more than a minute analyzing the wood before he asked the logger, “Where’d you find this?”\n\nAfter the company man answered they had cut it down two days ago, the arborist looked at him with a puzzled expression before replying.\n\n“This is fossilized wood. It’s been dead for centuries.”\n\nI left the factory soon after. Preceding my departure, I asked Alan how many people knew. He said that everyone in the logging company did, and that the vast majority of the locals at nearby towns and some in the city had at least a rudimentary knowledge of the urban legends about the area.\n\nWhen asked about Silly, Alan told me that she was hired through some program and had been working there longer than him. I made a note to come back and talk with Silly. She seemed to know something about the area, and I am curious about what she had planned to tell me before we were interrupted.\n\nI also plan on visiting the trailer park that Barry Campbell resided in. A few questions to friends and family might clear up a few things.\n\nAfter a bit of convincing, Alan agreed to let me borrow some of the logging company’s books containing records, data, and other information for a couple days. I’m in my hotel room again now. Tomorrow, I plan to enter the dead zone. I need to confirm Alex’s last known location and, if possible, find the cave he mentions. Alan offered to drive out there with me so at least I won’t be alone.\n\nWe aren’t going in unarmed. I understand the dangers of my job and the things I encounter as a result. I’m confident that I’ll be ready for whatever waits, and hopefully find Alex. Or at least find a better explanation for his disappearance.\n\nI’m not certain exactly what may have had a part in Alex’s disappearance so if any of you have any ideas, please share. From what I’ve read and heard from others, the closest thing it can be compared to is a Wendigo. Annoying shits, and deadly too, but manageable if you know what you're dealing with. But that doesn’t explain the queer characteristics of the dead zone. Just as well, the characteristics mentioned in Alex's post doesn't align with those of a Wendigo...\n\nI will admit, this is the first case that I've worked in some time where I feel I am going into it blind. The evidence available feels like only a few pages out of an entire Sherlock Holmes novel. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like a proper detective myself.\n\nI hope I'm just imagining my ignorance to be in my head. Still, I will continue cautiously.\n\nI’ll update you guys again when I return from this trip.\n\nHappy Holidays.\n\n\\-JT",

The last year the Dead Zone was cleared through was recorded as 1840. There were no numbers recorded for how much timber was collected and how much money was made on average in this zone, but the last two boxes in the row puzzled me.\n\nMost Common Tree Species: *Rot*\n\nMen Necessary for Zone Clearance: *7*\n\nI looked up at Alan.\n\n“How the hell do seven men clear hundreds of miles of woods?”\n\nAlan finished pouring another drink into his glass before he answered simply, “They don’t.”\n\nAnother swig and the liquor disappeared from his glass. Encouraged by my silence, he continued.\n\n“It should say on there the last time they completely cleared those woods was sometime in the 1800s, but the last time we tried was in 2020.”\n\n“Tried?” I asked.\n\nAlan clarified.\n\nWhile 1840 was the last time the company completely cleared the dead zone, they replaced their routine deforestation with a seven-man crew sent every twenty years to cut down a few dozen trees. The reason being that the timber collected from the dead zone would wither to its core roughly 24-48 hours after it was chopped down. Since the company's creation, this peculiar phenomenon had occurred every time the area was logged.\n\nAccording to workplace legend, the wood was taken to an arborist to be studied. The arborist spent no more than a minute analyzing the wood before he asked the logger, “Where’d you find this?”\n\nAfter the company man answered they had cut it down two days ago, the arborist looked at him with a puzzled expression before replying.\n\n“This is fossilized wood. It’s been dead for centuries.”\n\nI left the factory soon after. Preceding my departure, I asked Alan how many people knew. He said that everyone in the logging company did, and that the vast majority of the locals at nearby towns and some in the city had at least a rudimentary knowledge of the urban legends about the area.\n\nWhen asked about Silly, Alan told me that she was hired through some program and had been working there longer than him. I made a note to come back and talk with Silly. She seemed to know something about the area, and I am curious about what she had planned to tell me before we were interrupted.\n\nI also plan on visiting the trailer park that Barry Campbell resided in. A few questions to friends and family might clear up a few things.\n\nAfter a bit of convincing, Alan agreed to let me borrow some of the logging company’s books containing records, data, and other information for a couple days. I’m in my hotel room again now. Tomorrow, I plan to enter the dead zone. I need to confirm Alex’s last known location and, if possible, find the cave he mentions. Alan offered to drive out there with me so at least I won’t be alone.\n\nWe aren’t going in unarmed. I understand the dangers of my job and the things I encounter as a result. I’m confident that I’ll be ready for whatever waits, and hopefully find Alex. Or at least find a better explanation for his disappearance.\n\nI’m not certain exactly what may have had a part in Alex’s disappearance so if any of you have any ideas, please share. From what I’ve read and heard from others, the closest thing it can be compared to is a Wendigo. Annoying shits, and deadly too, but manageable if you know what you're dealing with. But that doesn’t explain the queer characteristics of the dead zone. Just as well, the characteristics mentioned in Alex's post doesn't align with those of a Wendigo...\n\nI will admit, this is the first case that I've worked in some time where I feel I am going into it, blind. The evidence available, feels like a few pages out of a Sherlock Holmes novel. In fact, I'm starting to feel like a proper detective. I hope I'm just imagining my ignorance to be in my head. Still, I will continue cautiously.\n\nI’ll update you guys again when I return from this trip.\n\nHappy Holidays.\n\n\\-JT",

        "text": "*This is a narrative constructed by the jotted-down notes in my journal regarding my experience of complete subjugation by the whims of the underestimated strength of nature. I wrote this not to understand what had happened, but to simply come to an acceptance of what did occur.*\n\n“Come on Josh! We need to reach the cabin before dark or else the wildlife may assume us to be a delicious deer,” I shouted while shaking my best friend’s shoulders. “Well, maybe not, but I haven’t been hiking in a while! Come on, come on! Let’s get going!”\n\nJosh opened his eyes a crack while muttering “whhaaaa?” in a groggy voice. He had been snoring in my passenger seat louder than my classic rock music during the three hour drive to the Bear Mouth National Park. I tried asking him for directions in the middle of the journey, but his heavy sleeping must have droned out my voice to nothing but the dialogue of a character in his dream, so I ultimately just used my phone’s GPS and the process of trial and error for navigation.\n\nJosh wasn’t unfriendly or anything. In fact, he was my best friend. He just claimed he stayed up too late the night before in preparation for the trip.\n\nI was actually quite shocked to find that Josh enjoyed hiking. I haven’t been hiking recently, as I’d mostly been spending my days studying at a university back in the city which he also attended. However, from my impression he seemed to spend even less time outside than me, and mostly barricaded himself in his dorm while doing homework, surfing the internet, or playing online video games with me.\n\nDespite my impression that Josh was directly opposed to the inconveniences of nature, he offered to take me to his favorite camping spot in the forests of Bear Mouth, in which he stated that his father owned a simple one room log cabin with an accompanying bathroom and shower. I was originally unsure if I would want to go hiking in such cold weather, but he said that the exercise and time away from the artificial light and noise pollution of the city would really help me relax.\n\nSeeing as my semester had ended, I quickly gave in to Josh’s idea. After all, I did have a stressful semester, and perhaps strolling through a quiet forest with my best friends was all I needed to avoid the dreaded college burnout that many of my acquaintances appeared to face.\n\n“You were the one who suggested this trip,” I mentioned to Josh as his groggy voice and fluttering eyelids returned to their natural awake states. “And I’m actually really looking forward to it. Are you ready to start walking?”\n\n“Oh yeah, I am. Sorry,” mumbled Josh before slightly creasing his mouth into a smirk. “Let’s get going! The cabin is about a three mile hike once we reach the end of the blue trail.”\n\nI groaned. Not only did we have to walk for the duration of a five mile hiking trail, but the cabin was also three additional miles further. My mind and body slouched downwards in unison upon knowing the amount of exertion I would need to do, but I think I convincingly hid my dread by giving a slight chuckle and telling Josh to lead the way.\n\nThe air was quite chilly, but I thankfully made sure to layer my clothes and wear my comically puffy jacket upon the insistence of Josh. It looks so stupid, but I’m well aware that I’d rather look like an orange marshmallow to some people than receive frostbite several miles from the nearest human civilization.\n\nMy talk with Josh was naturally just as pleasant as our hike. First we talked about the new video games we played, then about rumors going around campus, and finally we jumped into a deep conversation that we seldomly had.\n\nAfter we had passed the three mile marker and taken a five minute rest break, I heard Josh start to formulate a question and ask “Hey, um, Alex?” However, his exhausted gasps and wheezes cut off his question for a few seconds before he finished his thought. “Alex, why do you think humans have gone astray from our natural roots?”\n\nThis caught me off guard from the typically lighthearted goofball nature of Josh who always preferred cracking a joke over confronting his problems head-on. “Well…” I pondered, “Actually, would you like to take a break first? I will gladly answer your question, but you seem a bit tired,” I observed as my eyebrows raised.\n\n“No no it’s fine,” Josh spurted. “I go for hikes all of the time. I’m fine.”\n\nDamn, Josh is full of surprises. I simply was not aware of his frequent hiking routines, and now I wonder where he even went. The only greenery in our city is the central park, but I consider hiking different from walking in a concrete jungle with a hint of nature.\n\n“Well?” Josh pried. “Why do you think humans have gone astray?”\n\n“We haven’t,” I replied, though I was a bit confused by such a question. “Humans have utilized nature’s gifts to develop our species. We have made mistakes in damaging the source of such gifts, but we haven’t strayed away. Humans love nature, and we are constantly paying reparations in order to restore it to its past glory.”\n\nJosh paused. “We have taken advantage of nature’s gifts. Our reparations are not enough, and we owe everything to repair the damages our kind has done.”\n\nThe rest of the walk was silent aside from the sound of a light layer of snow squishing under the weight of our feet and the gasps of breath coming from Josh. For hours, we continued to walk, unsure of how to reignite such an unorthodox conversation. But just as the sun was about to completely set, I noticed a small wooden structure in the distance, which Josh identified as his cabin.\n\n“Come on Alex. We both need some rest.”\n\nJosh held the door open for me as I walked into the bare room with two single-person beds before he slammed it shut, protecting us from getting wet snow within the interior.\n\n“You take the left bed, and I’ll take the right,” asserted Josh before collapsing onto his self-assigned bed.\n\nMy confusion regarding Josh’s assertive nature, though initially intrusive, gradually began to fade into the back of my mind as my head hit the pillow. Perhaps he was simply tired and grumpy after such a long hike. At least that was the only conclusion I could derive before my eyelids lost the will to stay open after my head was completely subjugated by the pillow.\n\nMy eyelids fluttered up and down throughout the pitch-black night illuminated only by the glow of the mocking moon. Tossing and turning under the thick blankets covering my fragile skin, I noticed the outlines of shadows on the walls contorting and twisting like the tentacles of the infamous kraken. The shadows of the tree branches grew and waned throughout the night, as if performing a dance prior to a harvest, and in my hazy vision, I thought I saw Josh’s eyes wide open, as if entranced by such a ritual.\n\nUpon waking up, I rolled to my right to find the unmade empty bed that Josh slept in. Perhaps he had gone outside to find some firewood, as my exposed skin already felt as if it were frozen in a great arctic icebergs, but why would he leave without telling me?\n\nAfter further examination, I noticed Josh’s unscathed puffy blue jacket still hanging from the coat hook by the door. I don’t know why he would leave, but perhaps he had brought another jacket, as venturing into the snowy lifeless environment was a torture primarily experienced by only our primitive ancestors. Thankfully, he closed the door mostly closed before leaving, but the frantic wind appeared to have propelled the door into a slight wedge due to the non-existent strength of the limp deadbolt lock.\n\nI hurriedly put on my puffy jacket and fully opened the door only to find Josh not within my immediate eyesight. The forest seemed animated, as if dancing with perfect cohesion to the changing directions of the wind, and the falling snow performed an unpredictable dance before gracefully landing on the ground.\n\nThankfully, the snow and trees seemed to align with my desire to find my friend, as clear footprints were visible in the snow leading behind the cabin. To my knowledge, Josh at least had the sense to wear shoes.\n\nThe footprints marched rigidly forward into the heart of the forest, which lay hidden by the dense foliage of the evergreen trees, and I simply could not follow the exact trajectory of the footsteps, as the path was obstructed by the reaching branches of such trees, which appeared similar to the gate preventing a car from going down a road before paying a toll. As I swerved in a zig-zag pattern around such obstacles, I noticed that for the first time, the forest was not near silent.\n\nAs I walked through the agitated snow, I heard the whispers of mockery from the immediate surroundings, but whenever I stopped moving, so did the unnatural noises. As I trudged forwards, eyes darting around the remaining foliage, I noticed the once rising sun being replaced by shadows as the tree coverings made the surface level darker and darker.\n\nThe taunting whispers continued as I trudged through the growing elevation of snow and stepped on the severed limbs that had disconnected from the trees. I knew that I needed to turn around, but I also needed to find my best friend, so I continued to progress forward against my better judgment.\n\nThe seemingly hopeless journey instantly found a purpose as I heard Josh’s voice to my left. I rushed towards his unnaturally monotone voice to find him kneeling before a mammoth tree with his back facing me.\n\nWith his voice remaining unbroken, he stated “In reparation for our misdeeds, I offer my best friend Alex as a sacrifice. He is my only best friend, and I hope that this will appease you.” He opened his eyes and turned around before he stammered backwards with his mouth agape. “I’m sorry Alex, but my family needs to appease the forest.”\n\n“What?” I stammered. “Josh, what are you doing? Why are you out here? Come on, you need to get back inside. Your cheeks are red! Did you even bring a jacke-” I was unable to finish as I felt a large wooden branch sweep under my legs, sending me falling to the floor.\n\n“I’m sorry,” whispered Josh before he sprinted forwards, as if running from a monster.\n\nMy head stung as I lay on the floor while wondering what had happened, but I regained my wits when I saw the largest branch of the tree behind me rise slowly into the air. My clumsy roll to the left just barely propelled my body far enough away to avoid the branch from slamming down onto the portion of ground where I just was. A mighty roar bellowed from behind me as I got to my feet and sprinted away from what I assumed to be a tree.\n\nAt first I assumed that I had surely escaped, as I did not hear the giant-like footsteps I expected thundering from behind me, but my arrogance soon faded upon seeing the branches of the evergreen trees swinging like a viking berserker. Their once elegant dance turned into a flurry of aggravated stiff strikes, which appeared to flail in random directions. Not caring if branches collided with one another, they whirled rapidly in a desperate attempt to give as many blunt attacks to my skull as possible.\n\nBy a stroke of luck, as if mother nature wished to aid me from her own abomination, I noticed that the lower branches of the trees were nothing more than twigs which could do no damage, and through an exhausting endeavor, I managed to perform a frostbite-inducing army crawl until I lay flat on a paved road, in which a patrolling Park Ranger found me within the hour.\n\nAfter providing me with a blanket and offering his remaining hot coffee, he drove me to the parking lot where my ex-best friend and I started the hike a little over a day ago. I wanted to tell the Park Ranger of the events that had happened, but my exhausted and confused brain could not formulate a decisive and believable account of the events that unfolded.\n\nToday I’m typing this narrative as a comprehensive story of what I experienced, which to my understanding would be marginally more believable than the frantic notes I took in my hiking journal. Everything at my campus and my life returned to normal, minus the presence of Josh.\n\nSeeing as I was his only friend, no one seemed to know about his whereabouts since we went on our camping trip, nor did anyone else seem to care. Though I tried to send him angry text messages demanding answers for what he had planned, I still hope that my ex-best friend is okay. Perhaps I’m just a fool who is too trusting in people who have wronged me, but he was a phenomenal companion until that day, and I simply can’t erase his good deeds from my memory.\n\nI hope that no one will be forced to confront one of mother nature’s abominations as I have and I obviously do not wish to return. However, for the past few nights I’ve been plagued by vivid nightmares in which I confront the sturdy mammoth tree. \n\nThe forest demands that I pay reparations.",

        "text": "[Part #1 (The Night Sky Looks Different Tonight)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zwp94t/the_night_sky_looks_different_tonight/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt came back. I don’t know how, but it all came back. Almost instantaneously, the terror we witnessed was washed away – and in its wake something entirely new had revealed itself. My name is Hank Beauregard, and eight months ago the night sky began to fade into pure nothingness. As I’m sure you know, the general public picked up on this a while back, and I hope the ensuing panic hasn’t been too harsh on you. The riots in my city kept me up for about a week after the initial news reports came out. I already had trouble eating and sleeping before the uproar began, but their reactions to this event only added to my malaise. It’s confusing enough when billions of stars disappear, but it’s even more perplexing when they start coming back.\n\nRoughly five days after it had come into view, the expanding void faded as if it had never occurred in the first place. The Sagittarius-Carina arm was back, and so were the Magellanic Clouds. When we aimed our telescopes at it, the Carina dwarf galaxy sparkled as it always had. We spent a painstaking amount of time surveying the night sky, re-documenting each and every star we could identify with what we had. Everything was as it should be – well, everything except for one small detail.\n\nLooking over images of Messier 16 – also known at the Eagle Nebula – we saw that the region known as the “Pillars of Creation” was nowhere to be found, scattered into dust by some unseen force. None of us knew what happened to it – it just vanished. I ran my hands through my hair, desperately trying to hang onto myself as I grappled with the impossible sight.\n\nTwo restless weeks later, there were still no signs of the Pillars. We frantically flipped through hundreds of images, each taken at slightly different angles by every telescope and observatory the world had aimed at the nebula. We prayed to someone – to anyone – that the Pillars would come back. At this point we didn’t give a damn about them in particular – we just wanted a sense of normalcy again. The sweat running down my forehead only added to the sensory nightmare that occurred around me, as my frenzied colleagues shouted and paced around the facility seemingly to no end.\n\nWe found one image that stood out, however. It wasn’t the Pillars – it was something else. I don’t know what the hell we were looking at, and to be honest I still have no idea. My coworkers and I just stared at it, blank-eyed and frozen in place.\n\nAt this point, hallucinations seemed like a possible answer to what we saw. There was something else where the Pillars of Creation should have been. The protostars around Messier 16 were dimming slightly, then returning to its initial glow. Slowly but surely, other stars underwent the same process, dimming for an instant before regaining their brightness. My predecessors had used this phenomenon to detect the presence of exoplanets over decades by measuring the timespan of the change in brightness. Using this method, we argued that this object was no larger than Titan – Saturn’s largest moon. None of us could explain how it moved so quickly, let alone how it moved at all. I suppose, to some degree, it was comforting to know I wasn’t the only confused person in the room.\n\nThe next week was perhaps the strangest so far. Using our measurements of changes in apparent magnitude across stars in the vicinity of Messier 16, the object was somehow moving at relativistic speed, showing no sign of slowing down. Just as the horror set in, something else started hovering over our heads. Messier 16 is roughly 7,000 light-years away. This anomaly – whatever it was – had seemingly moved across 0.0546 light-years over the course of the last three weeks – in other words, it was moving at roughly 95% the speed of light. If this was true, then based on when we were able to image it, its path would take it near Earth in a little over 368 years.\n\nThe event was astronomically soon – implausibly so, at that – but it still gave us time to prepare for their arrival, if it was even possible to do so. We desperately submitted our findings to every major journal as soon as we had them, and they were published within a year. I don’t know exactly why, but I would have guessed the appearance of a gargantuan cosmic anomaly would have sped up the peer-reviewing process. Whatever the case, we found what we found, and hopefully it was one-to-one with reality. We finally got our manuscript published, and I couldn’t help but laugh. I laughed and laughed until tears streamed down my face. I gripped my chair and fell to the floor. I was powerless to stop whatever was coming, but I took solace in knowing that my grip on that chair was my choice and mine alone.\n\nMy belief was far from suspended, but sheer terror still resonated through my mind. The sky was changing yet again – and this time, at an even faster rate than normal. Just as it had before, an expanse of blackness spread across the sky, replaced by an expanding band of starlight. It looked almost like oscillation, as if these titanic voids were rippling through space and time. We couldn’t possibly have known that it would occur. That being said, it would only make sense that more strange phenomena would come our way.\n\nJust as we had before, we used the transit method as the stars of Messier 16 dimmed and brightened in a fraction of a blink of an eye. According to our observations, two more of these massive entities appeared, each one seemingly as large as the first. They were heading in the same direction as their predecessor, forming a small fleet of impossible bodies. As terrifying as these things were, I will admit: I was more than fortunate to be able to research such a captivating discovery from afar.\n\nNews reports about the ongoing observations only added pressure to our research. On top of monitoring the approaching objects, we were tasked with presenting our data in a way that would placate everyone currently panicking. Granted, it was more than understandable to be in such a state – we had all witnessed parts of the sky literally disappearing earlier this year. Sadly, each news report was as sensationalist as the last, which certainly didn’t put people at ease. It was far from our top priority, though, as I’m sure you know.\n\nMonths went by and the mysterious triad drew ever closer. Monitoring their voyage became our new routine, and – for a time – I almost accepted the entities as just another part of my daily reality. As far as I know, the world came to terms with their existence, reluctant as they may have been. Most people went back to their daily lives – after all, what more could they have done? What could any of us do, really? We didn’t know what we were dealing with. We didn’t know how to stop them. Hell, we couldn’t run, and we sure as hell didn’t have any place to hide. All we knew was that their trajectory aligned with Earth, and they sure as hell weren’t changing direction.\n\nSome of us turned to faith in these strange times. I even found myself praying again. A few groups saw the entities as divine in nature – either sent by gods or gods themselves. Before long, fledgling cults started appearing, providing false hope of raptures and salvation to the vulnerable masses. I resented them for taking advantage of people, but then again – they were as far beyond my control as the things they worshiped.\n\nLast night, another anomaly came knocking at the door. On March 22nd, 2023, we received an electromagnetic signal from deep space at approximately 3:19 AM, Central Standard Time. We don’t know what it means or who sent it, but we determined that it originated from the TRAPPIST-1 system – roughly 40 light-years from Earth. We have yet to translate it to anything even remotely legible, but we’re going to notify as many people as possible tomorrow. I don’t care if people panic again – I really don’t. If there is someone out there who can help us, this is how we spread the word. I don’t know if we’ll be able to decipher the message – if it can be deciphered at all. All I know is that the night sky keeps changing, and I don’t know if it’s for better or for worse.",

It promised to connect users with like-minded individuals and facilitate meaningful conversations. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try.\n\nAs I entered the chat room, I was greeted by a sea of screens, each one belonging to a different person. I scanned the room, trying to find someone to talk to, when I noticed a message from a user named \"Lily.\"\n\n\"Hey there,\" she wrote. \"I saw you just joined the chat. What brings you here?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment before responding. Something about her message seemed off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I shrugged off the feeling and introduced myself.\n\nWe chatted for a while, discussing everything from our favorite books to our careers. Lily seemed like a normal, friendly person, and I was enjoying our conversation.\n\nBut as the night went on, things started to take a turn. Lily began asking me increasingly personal questions, probing into my relationships and my past. I tried to brush it off, but the more I talked to her, the more I realized that there was something off about her.\n\nAs the conversation continued, Lily revealed that she had been watching me for a long time. She knew things about me that no one else did, and she seemed to take pleasure in using that information against me.\n\nI tried to leave the chat room, but every time I tried, Lily's messages followed me. She seemed to be able to track my every move, and I couldn't escape her.\n\nI began to feel like I was being stalked, and I started to get scared. I tried to tell myself that it was just a chat room, that I was safe behind my screen, but the more I talked to Lily, the more I realized that she wasn't just a normal person.\n\nShe was something else entirely. Something evil.\n\nAs the weeks went on, Lily's messages became more and more threatening. She told me that she was watching me, that she knew everything about me. I tried to ignore her, but it was hard to shake the feeling that she was always there, lurking in the shadows.\n\nOne night, I received a message from Lily that sent shivers down my spine. \"I'm coming for you,\" she wrote. \"I'm going to make you pay for what you did.\"\n\nI had no idea what she was talking about, but I knew that I had to get away from her. I frantically packed a bag and fled my house, driving as far away as I could.\n\nBut even as I put distance between us, I couldn't shake the feeling that Lily was still with me. Her presence seemed to follow me, no matter where I went.\n\nI realized then that I was dealing with something far more sinister than just a creepy chat room user. Lily was something evil, and she was coming for me.\n\nI don't know how long I'll be able to keep running, but I know that I can't stop. Lily is still out there, waiting for me, and I know that she won't rest until she gets her revenge.",

For months, I had been blissfully unaware of my second existence, and the family I had found myself part of. But I was never allowed to fully see it. \n\nAnd now that I had glimpsed it, or at least pieces of it,  I wanted to stay in the world where I was ignorant and peered through rose tinted glasses, submitting to the bleeding darkness rotting my thoughts. Where I went to class, drank Starbucks with Nona, and pushed myself to the very back of my mind.  It told me not to look.\n\nIt told me to never look because what I would see would wake me up. Never find the corner of your eye. Never find me. That is what it told me. And if I did, if I peered into the abyss, I had seconds to look away before it swallowed me whole.\n\nBut in those bursts of clarity, I realised that I was splitting in half. No. I was already halved. I was already broken into two pieces. And one of those pieces was so far out of reach, a shadow of myself sharing who I was. Body and mind. Now that I was partially aware of this shadow, I saw her in glimpses. I saw what she was seeing.  \n\nImages came like a flickering VCR. I could hold onto them as long as I closed my eyes and breathed in deep, wrangling these memories which had been shoved back. They caused pain.\n\nThey made me bleed from my nose. \n\nBut I had to see them. I had to see my reality for what it was. A room resembling a cave.  Sharp edged ceiling. Walls spattered a deep, intense red which took her breath away—and a slithering darkness spider webbing across tough brick. It acted like mould, like a living thing, sprouting from walls made of crumbling rock.  She wasn’t alone. Four shadows surrounded her. Three of them matched her, while another towered over them. Far bigger. \n\nOlder.\n\nThere was something wet clenched in her fist. It was wet and warm, trickling through her fingers and staining the palms of her hands.\n\n“Did we do it?”\n\nHer words came out in sharp breaths. She squeezed the wet thing tighter until it was coming apart between her fist.\n\nThe others were silent, but she continued, her tone darkening. Impatience. I felt it creeping up on her. Doubt.\n\nSeconds passed. They felt like minutes. She stared into the dark, and it stared back. Three pairs of eyes found hers, while the looming larger figure cleared their throat. “Try again.”\n\nThe man’s voice was disembodied with enough static to tear away an identity. My shadow opened her mouth to speak, to try it again. \n\nShe licked her lips, her tongue in knots. Before it came. I’m not sure how. The image is not completely clear. I just know what one minute my shadow was glaring at the ground with her arms folded, ready to blame anyone and everyone in  the circle—and then something was happening. And that something was bubbling and brewing, spouting from the floor. Like the mould which crawled up brick. But fresh. It ran in rivers like blood, surrounding them. And I felt her delight. The ignition of joy they all shared. Synergy. \n\nWhat she was supposed to feel with her writing class, she finally felt with them. \n\nThe darkness was at their feet. It bled from the ceiling and the floor, creeping up legs and twining around her waists, tendrils with needle-like points protruding into the back of her head and entwining around her spine and cracking into skulls, wrapping itself around minds choked with fog. They welcomed it. She welcomed it. I felt igniting pain when it filled her, bleeding into her being—her lips opening in a soft O. But she didn’t feel agony, or fear. Instead, my shadow revelled in unimaginable pleasure which sent her to her knees begging for more. It liked that. It liked that she was begging, pleading for it to go further. Deeper. Until it was rooted deeply inside her skull, already leeching itself onto her soul.\n\nSplitting her in half.\n\nThe others followed her, falling like dominoes. Exhales of breath tangled in intoxication.  Sharp. Cutting.\n\n“Miss Hughes?”\n\nThe receptionist’s voice was a southern drawl. Friendly enough. It tore me from another splinter of what I had pushed deep down.\n\nDo you know hard it is to turn yourself in for kidnap and murder?\n\nI’ve seen it on cop shows. I don’t know, I guess I figured these criminals had no emotion. No empathy.\n\nSo, they didn’t give a shit.\n\nBlinking rapidly, two different realities contorted into each other. I wasn’t sure which was real. Which one was mine?\n\nWas it the room filled with shadows, strangers with no faces? Or the sheriff’s office. \n\nWide windows I was sitting next to, a ceiling fan which hummed lightly, and the very faint smell of ramen twisting my gut into knots. Who knows. In my mind, both were as real as each other. While I was Alice, tumbling down that rabbit hole. Plunging further and further into insanity—or perhaps an insanity which was always inside me.  I did know one thing for sure. \n\nJumping up, I grabbed my bag. I was shaking. I couldn’t stop fucking shaking. I didn’t know what to do with my hands.\n\nDid I fold them across my chest or let them hang? Did I try and hide them under my jacket sleeves or stuff them in my pockets? \n\nSo many questions buzzing around my brain. I already knew what I was going to tell the sheriff’s office. But I wasn’t sure how. I had been sitting on a not so comfy bench for what felt like hours, rehearsing what I was going to say. Maybe the receptionist knew that. Maybe she had a good eye and could see Kenji’s blood staining the tips of my fingers and tingling my jacket sleeve. I couldn’t get it off. \n\nNo amount of soap and water and scrubbing could get it off. The receptionist was giving me an odd look. I wasn’t surprised. I could barely stand still, my breaths coming out in sharp pants I had to hide between clenched teeth. I had already told her my name was Cassie Hughes, and I needed to talk to someone—but every time someone came up to me, I seized up. I couldn’t breathe. My tongue was in knots. Alphabet soup at the back of my throat. “Miss Hughes,” The receptionist cleared her throat, offering me a smile which matched her friendly trill. \n\n“Are you alright?”\n\nHer gaze flicked to my right sleeve, and my heart dove into my throat. She knew. I could tell. I could tell by the look on her face.\n\nShe knew what I had done to him.\n\nSuddenly, it was so easy to say it. Now that I had exposed myself, exposed what covered me, painted me—fucking stained my skin. I had no reason to hide anymore. My eyes filled with tears, and I was wondering how. How could I feel sad? How could I possibly have empathy when I was covered in my classmate’s remains? \n\nIt was still warm. Dried, but warm. It still felt like it was alive. I remembered how it felt slick on the palms of my hands and running down my wrists. I remember it staining my lips. “I want to turn myself in.” I managed to choke out. There was a beat, and I gave up and folded my arms tightly across my chest. I wanted to hide Kenji. \n\nEven if I had already exposed it, I wanted to hide what was left of him.\n\nThe receptionist’s demeanour abruptly changed. She stiffened up, her eyes darkening. “Calm down.” She said softly. I almost laughed when she handed me a handkerchief. No, I did laugh. And then I wondered if it would scrub off intense, stubborn red.  “Turn yourself in for what?”\n\nHow would she say it? I wondered how my shadow would admit to her—our—crimes.\n\nIt’s funny. I said it like a joke. I was laughing, but it was more of a sob I was muffling with my sleeves. I wondered why I felt emotion. I didn’t deserve emotion. I didn’t deserve to cry. \n\nSo, I got a hold of myself. I dropped my arms to my sides and heaved in a breath. My shadow never felt for what she had done. She drew blood like it was child’s play, revelling in the pleasure of bleeding mortality and the darkness wrapped around her. Around them. There was only one way to stop her, to stop whatever this was from continuing—and that resolution was to hand myself in. I’m not sure how I said it.\n\nI must have waited a long time, playing with the words in my mouth, seeing how they would taste and feel on my tongue. They felt foreign. Because they weren’t mine. They were hers. “For the kidnap and…and murder of my five classmates.”\n\nI waited for her reaction, but she didn’t have one. So, I continued. With bile creeping its way up my throat, I named them in a singular breath.\n\n“Rowan Carlisle, Imogen Rode, Tao Aster, Eleanor Martinez, and…” I drifted off, my voice breaking out into a shattered sob.\n\nFuck. With quivering fingers, I feverishly pulled my sleeves over blood soaked hands, sniffling, and snottering, and wondering why the fuck I felt like this. I didn’t deserve those tears. I didn’t deserve an aching chest and twisting gut. \n\nStop being sad! I wanted to scream at myself.\n\nWhy are you sad? Are you sociopathic? \n\nAre you just… copying emotions? \n\nMimicking tears? I thought back to Eleanor. \n\nMaybe I had subconsciously drank in exactly how she reacted to trauma and pain. \n\nWas I perfectly copying her freak out?  \n\nWhy was I so fucking sad?!  \n\nI wasn’t allowed to cry over my stained skin. I wasn’t allowed to break apart and say his name over and over again until my chest was heaving. The urge, my god, the urge to slam my fist into my head repeatedly— it was overwhelming. Like a drug injected directly into my veins. Ignoring the voice inside my head, I kept going, squeezing the edges of her desk like it was my own personal anchor. “Kenji Cato.”\n\nSeveral hours earlier, I was on the way to my parents’ summer cabin with enough hope and denial to fill my emptying tank. I was aware of the blinking red light signalling I was running out of gas, but I was almost there. Just a little more. \n\nSqueezing the steering wheel, I stamped on the gas. It was cold. Fucking cold. The kind of cutting cold which sliced into the back of my neck, sharp needles protruding into my flesh. \n\nBut this cold was good. This cold was a distraction to what I was doing. \n\nWinding down the window, I laughed into a particularly ice-cold gust, and I didn’t feel any better. So I laughed again. And this time I got an answer in the form of a loud bang coming from the trunk. Kenji was being unnecessarily difficult. However, I could see why he was being an asshole. I had thrown him in the back of my car after promising to let him go. But he didn’t know how important his presence was. Kenji Cato was the fourth writer to be taken and had been stuffed into my trunk. \n\nAccording to the guy himself, I was his kidnapper. But I wasn’t working alone. And along with my fellow partners in crime shrouded in anonymity, I had tied him up, stuffed his mouth with prunes and covered him with embalming fluid, with his apparent fate being my parents’ summer cabin in the woods. \n\nI wanted to call him crazy. I wanted to tell him there was no way I was involved. But there was solid evidence showing I was. Eleanor Martinez’s sleeve stuffed under my pillow, and incredibly incriminating evidence showing me driving towards the apparent scene of the crime. I had two choices. \n\nI could either let him go and get myself arrested, or keep him for… investigative purposes. Kenji was the only one who knew who Brontë was. He was perhaps the only lead to what the fuck was going on with me—and where the missing writers were. So, yes. I understood why he was making as much noise as possible, muffle-screaming over my Spotify playlist. But I was also aware of cop cars passing and had found myself contemplating knocking him out. Morally wrong, yes. \n\nBut.. helpful.\n\n“Mpphmmphh!” Kenji’s muffling was getting progressively more aggravating when it was cutting into my lo-fi tunes.\n\nThank god my parents decided they wanted some semblance of privacy. We were in the middle of nowhere, driving down a particularly bendy road. It was nice scenery. \n\nIf I wasn’t in that situation I might have pulled out my phone and took a photo. Instead, I gripped the wheel tighter with one hand, and with the other I thwacked the passenger seat in what I hoped would come across as threatening and intimidating.\n\n“Kenji. Stop.” \n\nSpeaking through my teeth, I didn’t mean to sound so pathetic. I was aware of my twisting gut and aching chest. Keeping my eyes on the road, I fought against finding the corner of my eye. Where I knew it would be waiting for me. Waiting to tell me to turn back. Ignore. \n\nI could already feel it, wet slithering darkness crawling up my leg and suffocating my mouth and nose. It smelled rancid, a mixture of rot and mould, and the chemical covering my classmate. But it was also another flash of what I wasn’t allowed to see—a glimpse into why exactly it was there, and why Kenji Cato was stuffed into my trunk. Why three other writers in my class had been kidnapped and whisked into oblivion.\n\nLook away.\n\nI did, and thankfully, the bleeding tendrils let go of my legs. I reached out and tried to grab something tangible, but there was nothing.\n\n“Mpphmmphh!”\n\nKenji wasn’t helping. If I thought he was actually going to tell me what was going on, I was a naïve fucking idiot.\n\n“I’m going to let you go.” I hissed out. And when he answered with an equally annoying muffled cry, I hit the seat again.\n\nThis time my words emphasised each feverish slam. I didn’t realise how dusty my seats were until the air was sparkling, and my gaze was catching something poking from the compartment. Look away. The voice was louder, more scathing. Submitting to the voice, I turned my gaze to the road, and thwacked the seat again. Harder. “I. Said. I’m. Going. To. Let. You. Go!” I yelled. “Just stop, okay? Kenji, stop!”\n\n Silence.\n\nThe sounds of shuffling.\n\n“You want to know what happened to Rowan, right?” I choked out. “Imogen and Tao?” I was less enthusiastic with Eleanor’s name.\n\n“We’re going to find out where they are!”\n\n“Mpphmm?” I had grown so used to his muffling in the short time we had been forced together, it had almost become comprehensible.\n\nReally? I translated his sarcastic laugh.\n\n“Mpphmmpmphmmhpph.”\n\nAre you fucking serious? You’re crazy!\n\n“Mpphmmphmmmmmhmmphmmmhppmh.”\n\nYou’re going to jail, Cassie. I hope you like prison food!\n\nI thought he’d stopped after a while of shuffling and the occasional loud bang, which I secretly hoped meant he’d managed to knock himself out. For one glorious moment there was only the sound of my Spotify playlist, and my own heavy breaths. Before he started all over again, and I ended up ignoring him. But it didn’t stop my anxiety shooting through the roof every time a cop car appeared behind us. \n\nThankfully, though, I managed to find my parents’ summer cabin, which was tucked into a clearing in the middle of the wood at the edge of town. The feeling of dread began to uncoil in my gut when I jumped out of my car and breathed in the thick smell of mildew and soil.\n\nI should have been hit with nostalgia. Memories of running around with my siblings, having picnics in the dirt and playing on the tire swing dad had made for us. Instead, though, I found myself being hit with memories of crunching leaves beneath four separate pairs of shoes—and a squirming body being dragged in dirt. \n\nIf I concentrated, I could feel something wet on the palms of my hands, stringy rope dangling from my hands. Low voices. Someone kicked the squirming figure, a strong pair of hands lifting the lump into their arms, slinging them over their shoulder. \n\nMy gaze went to a nearby tree. I could see traces of deep red, ancient symbols carved with fingernails shaved to bloody stubs.\n\nSlowly, I was making my way over to the tree in long strides, my breath in my throat. I couldn’t breathe. Bird song which had one sounded beautiful to a younger me, suddenly sounded deafening. My legs felt like they were going to give-way, and I felt it again. I felt… him. He was there, tangling around my legs and creeping up my body, winding himself around my being, sticking needle-like tendrils inside my skull.\n\nThey perforated, and I screamed.\n\nWhether it was pain or pleasure, I wasn’t sure.\n\nRisking a glance, I turned. Slowly. Ever so slowly. Until I could see him—it—hanging in my peripheral. Inky darkness fraying my vision.\n\nI wanted to look further.\n\nTo find it.\n\nBefore a bang, which tore me from reverie. More muffled screaming. This time it was less of a frustrated yell. It was scared.\n\nHyperventilating. \n\nKenji knew we had arrived. The cabin was just a few feet away, hidden behind a crumbling brick wall. It used to stand tall when I was  a kid. \n\nNow it was a shell of its former glory, battered by seasonal elements. Taking in deep breaths and forcing myself to stay calm, I strode over to the trunk and yanked it open—and the first thing I saw was a blooming red bruise in the middle of Kenji’s forehead. So he had smashed his head on something. My guess was some old piping I’d pulled from the engine. \n\nThe guy was startled, shuffling back, his eyes wide. They flicked from me to the expanse of green surrounding us. I already knew what he was thinking. Kenji was a writer. Best known in our class for his horror. This was the perfect place to kill, and then hide a body. To reassure him, I raised my arms in what I hoped looked like surrender.\n\n“I’m not going to kill you. ” I said. When I reached forward to grasp hold of him to pull him out of the trunk, he squirmed, shuffling back.\n\n“I’ll prove it.”\n\nHe raised his brow, still on edge. I could see him desperately trying to pull apart his restraints.\n\n“Are you going to scream?” I asked him.\n\nKenji seemed to contemplate his answer before shaking his head with an eye-roll. Which was not the attitude I was expecting.\n\nI nodded, ripping off the tape. He still smelled of that chemical. It was a lot stronger mixing with the stink of BO and axe spray.\n\n“Ow!” He spat, shooting me a glare. “That fucking hurt!”\n\nI didn’t understand how he expected me to rip duct tape from his mouth and nose without it being painful.\n\n“I hate you.” He said with enough gusto and saliva frothing on his lips to mean it. “You’re going to jail for a long fucking time.”\n\nIt was nice he was finally revealing his true feelings. I knew the smile he shot me in class was fake.\n\n“As you keep saying,” I said. “And for the record? I’m not exactly gung-ho about you either.”\n\nTo my surprise, Kenji didn’t speak for a moment. His eyes wandered past me, settling on deep greenery and woodland. He stayed on his knees, seemingly deep in thought. Looking back, I think he was in shock. I think he was wondering if those woods would be his final resting place. \n\nKenji was a writer, so maybe he thought like one. Maybe he was subconsciously drinking in the scenery, already carving out his own fantasy world. Probably not. From the look on his face, he looked like he’d given up. Like he was ready for me to kill him and had accepted his fate. Despite me making it clear repeatedly that I had no intention of hurting him. I thought about speaking to the boy, before my gaze found the strip of duct tape hanging from my fingers. It was stained deep, dark red. Polluted and sticky with blood. I hadn’t been focusing on Kenji’s mouth and chin. \n\nThe Looney Tunes like bruise the size of the grand canyon sprouting from his forehead was distracting. But then I was looking at the state of him, at dried splatters running down his lips and chin. Fuck. I couldn’t resist reaching out and grasping his chin.\n\n“What happened?” I found myself saying. And then I was voicing questions I’d totally forgotten about. It definitely wasn’t normal to randomly start spitting out spattered red. Kenji didn’t shake me off. His eyes narrowed into slits. “I have no fucking idea,” he said. “Why don’t you ask Bronte?”\n\nI ignored that.\n\n“You’re bleeding.” I pointed out the obvious. “You’re bleeding bad. I mean… did someone give you something?”\n\nPoison? I thought. Maybe. But wouldn’t that have killed him by now? Besides, I doubt they sold sparkling cyanide at Walmart.\n\nMy classmate rolled his shoulders, wincing. “How about this?” He said. “You untie me, and I’ll tell you what you crazy fucks did last night.”\n\n“You’re speaking in plural.”\n\nHe raised a brow. “Did you skip basic English? Do you know what plural means?”\n\n“Yes.” I seethed. “You keep implying there are more of….” I choked on my own words, remembering shatters of a memory.\n\nFour pairs of footsteps.\n\n“Us.”\n\nKenji nodded. “Well, I’ve lost all the feeling in my arms and I’m baring shit up. I think I deserve some leeway. Untie me, and I’ll tell you.”\n\nI didn’t move. “You’ll run away.”\n\n“In my state? Really?”  Kenji leaned forward and coughed right in my face. Something wet hit my cheeks, and I inwardly squirmed. The blood barely fazed him, trickling down his chin. He licked pooling red on the corner of his lip with a sharp flick of his tongue, like he was making some kind of statement. This guy was had internal fucking bleeding and was somehow the one in control. “Even you’re not that stupid.”\n\nHe was right. There was no way he was going to start sprinting once I untied him. But I was also paranoid he was someone faking it.\n\n“I’m not untying you.” I said. “But. I won’t gag you again. If you’re…” I flinched every time my eyes happened to find the state of his lips and chin. He looked like a fucking vampire. I grabbed hold of his arms and yanked him from the trunk, settling him on the ground, helping him stand when he swayed off balance.\n\nImmediately, in pure Kenji fashion, he started struggling violently, hissing when the rope cinching his wrists together didn’t shift.  “Calm down.” I said. “If you’re barfing blood, then I want to keep an eye on you. You know, if it happens again.”\n\nKenji actually laughed. \n\nA throw-your-head-back laugh which boiled my blood. He attempted to pull away, and I dragged him back. “Oh, wow, thank you so much!” He gushed, stumbling almost drunkenly.  “Really. I am truly fucking grateful you’re nice enough to make sure I don’t barf up my internal organs.” \n\nKenji didn’t stop there. Being the drama queen he was, he mockingly dropped to his knees and bowed his head, spluttering on another cough or laugh. “My liege.” He choked. “Thank you for doing the bare minimum. Really. I am truly fucking grateful.”\n\nI found myself smiling. Maybe I was high on adrenaline, or I actually found him funny.\n\n“You should have joined the theatre club.”\n\nHe lifted his head. “The theatre club didn’t drag me from my bed in the middle of the night and force feed me prunes—so yeah. I should’ve.”\n\n“Get up.” I dragged him to his feet, and it hit me that I was actually acting like a kidnapper, tightening my grip on his arm. “You’re not funny,” I spat in his face. “I asked a simple question. And you’re going to answer it.” I heaved out a breath. “Please. Just tell me what happened.”\n\nWe started to walk. Or I did, dragging my disgruntled classmate along with me. Kenji started to talk once we were in silence, the sound of our footsteps crunching through the ground eerily relaxing. “It was last night,” He started in a mumble. “You all dragged me out of bed.”\n\nI nodded. “Go on.”\n\nHe sighed, squirming away from me. Kenji was trying to put as much space between us as possible. “Lesson your grip, I’m not an animal.”\n\nI did, loosening my fingers slightly. Ahead of us, I could see my parents’ summer cabin coming into view.\n\n“There were four of you,” Kenji said. “Two guys pulled me out of bed. A girl slammed something over my head, and when I woke up in the trunk of your car…” He turned to me, his expression contorting. I saw fear in his eyes. Fear he was trying to hide with sarcasm. “And there was you.” He turned away with a hiss. “You were the only one wearing a mask, and the others called you Brontë. You had this look in your eye. Like you were going to fucking kill me. Rip me apart and not even care.” Kenji choked out a laugh. “You were like a monster.\"\n\nSomething cold slithered down my spine.\n\n“That wasn’t me.” I found myself saying, and he whipped his head around with a scoff.\n\n“What, so is this a Split situation? College edition?” His lips curved into a scowl. “What did you do with Rowan, Imogen, and Tao? Did you kill them?\"\n\nPulling Kenji up the wooden front steps to the cabin, I swallowed barf making its way up my throat. The closer I was getting to the cabin, I was feeling sicker. Like something was inside that I wasn’t allowed to see. That I had to ignore. “I told you already,” I told him. “I.. I have no idea.”\n\n“But you did do something.” He whispered.\n\nI didn’t have the heart to tell him yes.\n\nHe didn’t answer. When I stepped inside what had always been my childhood solitude, I only felt a sickening sense of foreboding. The place was exactly how I remembered it.  The rainbow welcome mat my grandpa always complimented when he stepped inside. \n\nOld paintwork which felt both old and nostalgic. Peeling wallpaper and the wooden staircase I’d fallen down at the age of five. As I took slow steps inside, childhood memories threatened to resurface. Mom and her pumpkin pie. Halloween with my friends, slumber parties and senior parties, and secret bonfires.\n\nMy first kiss. I pushed it all down, focusing on the missing writers. They were here. They had to be. But there was nothing abnormal with my parents’ cabin. The lounge was still as cosy as ever, threaded couches and a flat screen TV sitting on a crumbling table. The kitchen was still well-stocked. I filled a glass of water for Kenji, but he just turned his nose up at it. \n\nIt’s weird. It’s like he knew where to go. While I was pottering around in the kitchen, trying to find anything which would signal someone had been there—my classmate strode over to a battered wooden door next to the crumbling staircase. He gestured to it with his head. “I’m going to guess it’s in the basement.”\n\nHe was right. And to be honest with you, I was fucking terrified of opening that door. I didn’t want to know what was down those stairs.  \n\n“Hey.” Kenji coughed again, blood splattering his lips. “Are you going to check down here or not?”\n\nNodding, I followed him, getting a good grip on his arm. When he sent me a sour look, I swallowed a yell. “Do you want to fall down a dozen cement steps?”\n\nIt was a rhetorical question, but Kenji was Kenji.\n\nHe answered with a splutter. “Are you asking if I’d rather tumble to my death down concrete steps than end up with the same fate as the others?” Kenji stumbled when I pulled open the door. I yanked him back before he could eat his words. He didn’t finish the rest of whatever snappy comeback he’d been thinking of. \n\nAs the two of us descended concrete steps, something hit me. I think Kenji noticed it too, stiffening up next to me. That smell. The stink which had covered him, Chemicals. Embalming fluid. The smell only grew stronger as we made our way down the stairs. When lights flickered on one by one above us, my classmate let out a strangled breath. “I knew it. You’re in a cult.”\n\n“What?\"\n\nWhen his stumbling feet almost went over the edge, I pulled him back. “What are you talking about?”\n\n“We’re walking down a secret passageway in your parents’ cabin in the woods,” he hissed out. “You’re definitely in a cult.”\n\nHe was close.\n\nNot quite a cult, but almost. As we got closer, orangeade light began to bleed into the dark. \n\nCandlelight.\n\nA sound suddenly trickled into my ears, and it took me a moment to realise what it was.\n\nKenji was already speaking in a sharp hiss. He jolted next to me, almost slipping.  “Fuck.” He whispered. “Is that… is that typing?\n\nInstead of answering, I quickened my pace, dragging him along with me. Inside my parents’ basement was different. it had been… renovated. There was no sign of the shelves full of wine or my brother’s swimming pool.\n\nInstead, I found myself staring at a several plastic chairs placed in an odd formation. There were candles set up on the floor. They were fresh flames. Just lit. Standing at the bottom of the stairs, with Kenji next to me, I wondered if I was hallucinating. Maybe that chemical smell had gone to my head. But no. Each chair was occupied. The guy was right. \n\nIt was typing. The sound which had been pricking into my skull was the sound of synchronous typing. And then I was putting two and two together. I was seeing slumped figures in odd angles. I was seeing blurs of blonde hair and dark hair, reddish curls poking from a ratty baseball cap. And… movement. I was seeing movement. Typing. Click, click, clicking. \n\nI don’t know when it was when I remembered how to move. But Kenji was first. He was lunging forwards with me, stumbling over to each chair. Imogen. Tao. Rowan. Neither of them were tied up, and that was where things grew confusing. They were just sitting there. The boy’s were slumped, while Imogen sat bolt upright. Typing. They were just typing. \n\nWhen I knelt in front of Rowan and slapped his cheek, screamed at him to wake up, he didn’t move. His eyes were glued to the MacBook Pro sitting in his lap. They held no light. Like they never had light. Turning my attention to the laptop screen, there was a word document open. But what he was typing was… gibberish. \n\nNo. No, it was a different language. Symbols which hurt my head. Rowan was typing at a speed I didn't think was possible, his fingers crooked and bent. \n\n“Rowan.” I was shaking. When I poked his skin, it was slimy. It stunk of that same stink. That chemical. I noticed his face was… different. His cheeks were pinker, lips plumper. Eyes wide. He was wearing makeup, I thought, a slither of panic sliding down my spine. Like he was being preserved. Again, I felt his cheeks. I pressed my hand against his forehead. He was ice cold. Ice fucking cold. Resisting the urge to jump back, I tried to ignore Kenji who was hyperventilating. \n\nHis breaths were sharp, heavy gasps for breath as he struggled with Tao and Imogen. I grasped Rowan’s shirt, fisting the material—and there it was again, at the corner of my eye. That same wet tendril of black trying to coil around my ankle. I ignored it, pressing my hand against my classmate’s chest. \n\nNo heartbeat. There was nothing. No beat of life, no sign of bodily fluid or struggle. \n\nThere was one thing. I had already noticed it, but my brain didn’t want to register it. Because part of me knew what I had done to my classmate. Part of me knew exactly what I had done. I think Kenji realised, several feet away from me. He cried out, shuffling back. Rowan’s nostril was… crooked. Wider. Like it had been previously forced open. My gaze flicked to empty, unseeing eyes and smiling lips.\n\nI couldn't look at him anymore. \n\nJust being near him was making me sick. \n\n“Tao! Hey, can you hear me?\" Crouching in front of my other classmate, his skin was ice cold. This time, a pinkish froth was dripping from his nose. Which confirmed my suspicions. I heaved, then. But nothing was coming up. “Get away from them,” I managed to gasp out to Kenji, who was prodding Imogen in the head. He was… crying. I had been so focused on what I was seeing, I didn’t notice tears splashing down his cheeks, mixing with tinged red. \n\n“What… is this?” He whispered. “What did you do?” His voice cracked. “Is this… is this what you were going to do to me?”\n\nHe gestured to Rowan. “What the fuck did you do? Why are they… why are they typing?”\n\nIt was a writing factory, I thought dizzily. Whoever I had been working with, we had created a writing factory under my parents’ cabin.\n\nWhat were they, some kind of farm? Why create a human farm created to write?\n\nAnd why were they writing?\n\n“This is what you did to them?” Kenji hissed out. He stumbled back, eyes wide. “Are you going to do this to me?”\n\n\"No!\" \n\n\"But you took me! You were going to do this to me!?\" \n\nHe backed away, and I found myself grabbing him. I was desperate. I needed him to know I didn’t do this. I didn’t do this!\n\nHours of confusion and frustration finally reached a boiling point.  “Why are you looking at me?!” I yelled, fear and frustration taking over. “Do you really think I have the time and effort to do all of… this?! You think I’m the grand mastermind to whatever this sick shit is?”\n\nKenji spat at me. “They’re dead.” He said. “They’re fucking dead! They’re dead, and they’re writing a novel? How is that possible?!”\n\nMy attention flicked to another room in the corner. The door was slightly open. And I saw it. I saw spattered dark shrouding the doorway, like this thing, this thing inside my head, was protecting it. Slowly, I started towards it, but Kenji’s voice sliced into my thoughts. He was frowning at something on the wall. It looked like notes. I didn’t recognise the handwriting. \n\n“Caulfield.” The boy said in a low murmur. \n\nCocking his head, Kenji managed to get a hold of himself, focusing on the notes. I followed him, skim-reading through writing. It didn’t seem that important. It was just story ideas. He turned to me, his eyes slightly unfocused. “That was the name of the guy who dragged me out of bed.”\n\n“Did you see his face?” I asked.\n\n“No, it was too dark. They hit me so I could barely concentrate on anything,” Kenji’s eyes lit up. “But you’re Bronte. And he’s Caulfield. Like Emily Brontë and Holden Caulfield. I think another of them was Finch. I’m going to say you and the girl are the Brontë sisters.”\n\nAtticus Finch. Holden Caulfield. \n\nThe Brontë sisters. \n\n“Famous writers.” I murmured. \"So, code names?\"\n\nKenji nodded. “Obviously.” He muttered. “But there’s more. You were talking crazy shit. Some kind of halving, and… and Thoth. You said something about Thoth.\"\n\n“Thoth?”\n\n“Thoth. God of literature.” Kenji paled. “But that can’t be… what this is, right?”\n\nBefore I could register what he was saying, I noticed something move at the corner of my eye.\n\nI could have sworn… just for a second. Had Tao straightened up? \n\nA trick of my mind, I thought dizzily.\n\nKenji was smart. He knew what the fuck he was talking about. So, I was going to listen. \n\nSuddenly, he was the one leading. While I was stumbling along behind him. But he only got several steps before he was doubling over, a wet sounding cough sending him to his knees.\n\nMore red trickled down his chin. When I gently grabbed him and pulled him to his feet, his eyes were wide like an animal. “You need to get this shit off me,” He hissed out. “Get it off me! Now!” He coughed again, and this time his whole chest moved. Like something was being dislodged inside him. Before I could help him, he was diving to his feet and staggering to the door I swore I wouldn’t open. But he didn’t go fully in, instead stopping abruptly in the doorway. Kenji coughed again. This time through a sob.\n\n“What the fuck.” Kenji said. “Is that?”\n\nSpread across the carpet, was what was left of a deer carcass, it’s heart ripped out— and smeared all over the walls, were symbols. A  surgical bed was set up, blood staining steel. Velcro straps. I had another flash of shoving a body down and pinning squirming wrists down. \n\nEleanor.\n\n\nThe memory was short, but it showed me everything I needed to know.\n\nI heard her rattling cough in perfect clarity in my head, and something splattered in my face. And I was reaching forward, pulling at something scarlet and slithering through her bulging lips. My gaze went to a metal bowl, and my gut twisted into knots. He runs back to the writers, and I stumbles. My gaze goes to what looks like instructions. “Oh, god.” He dropped to his knees and heaved, choking on bloody saliva.\n\n“I think I know what they’re doing.” He said in frenzied cries, trying and failing to scrub at himself. “I know what they’re doing. Oh fuck. Jesus. I know what they’re doing!”\n\nI knew what he meant.\n\nBecause then I was seeing it.\n\nHearing Kenji’s spluttered coughs, I could suddenly hear Rowan’s. Tao’s. Imogen coughing up liquidised red lumps streaming from her nose and mouth. The embalmment made sense. The dead bodies were just empty of thought, but everything else. Even the prunes in Kenji’s mouth. What I thought was some prank. \n\nI was seeing preservation.\n\nMummification.\n\nOr at least the start of it.\n\nThe only thing which didn’t make sense was the symbols on the walls. Whatever they were writing.\n\nKenji was laughing, sobbing, a hysterical mess.\n\n“This? This shit all over me? It’s inducing it!”\n\nHe heaved again, and part of me splintered. Whatever he had been embalmed in… I had to get it off.\n\nThe sound of engines, however, stopped us both dead. I didn’t have time to think. Dragging my classmate back up the stairs, I grabbed his face and forced him to look at me. “There’s a river two minutes from here,” I gasped out. “That should help you a little. Then get the cops.”\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off of sharp red rivulets snaking from his nostril. He nodded. “Untie me.” Kenji slurred in a panic. His chest was rattling. “Now!”\n\nGrabbing a knife, I remember the blade cut through his first zip tie. Then though, I was seeing it again. This time it pooled from the floor and rained down from the ceiling. My vision turned foggy, and I felt myself drop to my knees, and then face-plant the ground spilling inky black. \"Cassie?\" \n\nKenji's voice collapsed into a whistling sound. \n\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" \n\n\"Cassie!\" \n\nI don’t know how long I was out for. I dreamed of a room with sharp edges. Shadows in front of me.\n\nMy own voice speaking in tongues.\n\nI woke up at home. I was lying on my bedroom floor, and when I sat up, my head spinning, my hands were slick red. The most beautiful, terrifying, mesmerising shade I’d ever seen. It streaked my palms and drenched the tips of my fingers, staining my wrists and arms.\n\nKenji.\n\nHis name was the first in my mouth—because it was his. It must have been his, I had been with him.\n\nI was going to let him go.\n\nLet him run.\n\nWhat happened after I blacked out? The last thing which was concrete in my memory was the blade of my knife cutting through his restraints.\n\nI showered four times that morning. But it wouldn’t come off. Like Kenji’s blood was as stubborn as Kenji himself. I don’t know what my shadow did. I don’t know how she had driven my body back to my house and left me to pick up the pieces of what I was sure was my classmate. I didn’t wait for the announcement of Kenji’s disappearance. I knew I was involved, and that was all I needed to know. My dizzy and foggy thoughts led me to the sheriff’s station. And I was admitting to the crime my other half, my splintered shadow, had committed.\n\nI said their names, and they sounded so strange coming from my lips when I knew their fate. When I knew where they were.\n\n“Rowan Carlisle, Imogen Rode, Tao Aster, Eleanor Martinez…” I stuffed my hands in my pockets. “And Kenji Cato.”\n\nThere was a pause, and I thought the receptionist was going to speak before her gaze wandered behind me.\n\nHer eyes widened. “May I help you?”\n\n“Cassie Hughes, what are you doing here?”\n\nA gruff voice sent me twisting around, and I found myself face to face with my creative writing teacher. His smile was friendly.\n\nProfessor Peterson.\n\nIn my head, another memory was brewing.\n\nA fourth figure looming over three small shadows.\n\nProf Peterson cleared his throat. “I apologise for this,” He said cheerily. “My student is under a lot of stress right now. I can assure you she has nothing to do with the disappearances,” His arm slung around my shoulder, and in turn a soaking darkness wound around my throat. I felt it choking me, and once again I was all too aware I wasn’t just painted in what was left of Kenji. But Rowan, Imogen and Tao. Eleanor.\n\n“Come on now, Miss Hughes.” Professor  Peterson said, as cutting tendrils found my neck, choking words from my throat.\n\n“Let’s not be dramatic.”",

        "text": "I first noticed it yesterday.\n\nIt was 9am, a few days after Christmas, and I was wrapped up warm in my bed. I heard the familiar *buzz buzz* of my phone, charging across the room. I forced myself out of bed, slipped into the cosy slippers I had received this year, and hobbled over to the phone.\n\nIt was my friend, Lucy. We had arranged to go out for a meal the next day.\n\n\"I hope it's not this windy tomorrow!\"\n\nI texted her back. \"Lol yeah, I hope not.\"\n\nI hadn't even looked out the window yet, I just wanted to get back into bed. So, I did.\n\nI next woke up at about 1pm, having slept for way longer than I intended. But in the days of void between Christmas and New Year's Eve, who really cares? I got up, and opened the curtains to breathe some light onto my dull room.\n\nIt wasn't windy at all. What was Lucy talking about? Although, it'd been a few hours - I figured the wind had just died down. I stood for a moment and admired the clouds. It was the kind of sunny day where the sky is the right balance of cloudy and clear. Clear enough for the sun to pour onto the Earth, but cloudy enough to give a contrasting view upwards. It was very picturesque.\n\nWhat I didn't yet know is that the nightmare had already begun.\n\nI didn't go out at all that day, despite the great weather. I spent it on various streaming sites, in my pyjamas, going through 3 hot chocolates. As nice and cosy as I felt, something felt strange. I always feel strange after Christmas, feeling as though I exist in some kind of limbo. But this felt more exaggerated than usual. But I brushed it off.\n\nThe next day rolls around; Today.\n\nThe same routine again - I got out of bed at about 1pm, slipped into my slippers, and opened my curtains. I stopped to look at the sky again. It looked remarkably similar to the day prior. As I tend to do, though, I brushed it off as something \"a bit weird\".\n\nI realised my phone was on my bed. I had forgotten to charge it, and it was on just 2%. I had a missed call from Lucy, so I called her back.\n\n\"Hey Lucy, sorry I missed your call!\"\n\n\"No worries - Are we still on for 2?\"\n\n\"Yeah absolutely! I'm basically ready!\" (I was not.)\n\n\"Cool, just wanted to check because of how windy it is again.\"\n\n\"Oh? It doesn't seem that windy?\"\n\n\"Ha, wait until you get outside. It's horrible! Just let me know if you need to cancel.\"\n\n\"Alright, sure... Will do... Speak to you soon!\"\n\nAs soon as I put the phone down and on to charge, I opened my window and stuck my hand out. It didn't feel windy at all. But I quickly forgot about it as I began to rush around getting ready. I just barely left the house at 1:40, with my phone now on 10% thanks to my dodgy charger, but knew I would at least get there on time now.\n\nAs I began to walk, I noticed the distinct lack of any wind at all; Not even a gentle breeze brushed past me. The sound of rustling leaves in the trees was eerily absent, and looking up revealed the clouds to be entirely motionless. I had never seen the air stand so still. If I stood still, and didn't move, the world looked as though it were frozen in time. Perfectly kept pristine for me. At that moment, it was oddly calming.\n\nUntil I noticed something even more peculiar - Something I hadn't yet noticed. I had not walked past a single person. I had not heard the chirp of a single bird. I had not seen a single car.\n\nI thought perhaps the wind had just recently stopped, and so nobody had come outside yet, though I also knew deep down that this was impossible, for I had known when I woke up that it wasn't windy at all.\n\nI arrived at the meeting spot at exactly 2. The town centre was absolutely dead and empty, with nobody in sight, not even Lucy. That's when she texted me.\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\nI was outside Pete's Pizza.\n\n\"I'm outside Pete's Pizza.\"\n\n\"So am I. Maybe you're behind the crowd lol, come closer to the door, I can't see you.\"\n\nCrowd? What crowd was she talking about?\n\n\"What crowd are you talking about?\"\n\nShe video-called me at this point, and it's when I truly realised what was going on. I answered, and at the same moment, we noticed we were standing in the exact same spot. Both of us directly outside the main entrance. Only in her video feed, other people were walking past her. I was completely alone.\n\nI was factually standing right on top of her. Yet I was clearly nowhere near her.\n\nWe both stood looking at each other through our phones - The only thing currently connecting us. Neither of us got a word out before my phone died. The only thing in the world acting as a window out of this just died in my hands.\n\nPanic began to set in.\n\nI ran into the restaurant. Empty.\n\nI ran into the shop across the road. Empty.\n\nI ran outside and screamed. It echoed through the empty streets.\n\nBeing alone has always been an anxiety of mine, and this is my worst fear realised into reality. I broke down on the road, crying. I wanted to wake up, but I was painfully aware of how awake I already was.\n\nThe run home took half the time it had taken me to get there. I turned on the TV, and...it was normal. Everything was normal. The signal is working completely fine. Yet physically I am alone. I am in my own world.\n\nI'm typing this from my laptop as my phone charges. Once I post this I'm going to call Lucy back. I don't know what this is yet. I just know that this isn't your world. It's connected to it. I mean, it must be, otherwise, how would I be able to use and browse the same internet as you?\n\nI look outside though and everything is so quiet. Everything is so lonely and empty, and I don't truly know where I am.\n\nThe trees do not sway; The clouds stand still; The wind no longer blows.",

The air felt chilly. I looked around quickly and saw we were still in the backroom of the visitor’s center, the door propped open to allow a view of the front sliding glass door. Nothing seemed amiss though someone had certainly cleaned up. The floor even looked swept and mopped.\n\n“What time is it?” I asked in a gruff voice.\n\n“Seven AM,” Max answered. I looked out the glass door in front in surprise.\n\n“Then why is it pitch black out?” They looked at each other and shrugged.\n\nI got up, my back cracking. I felt wiped out and sore. I felt cold and uncomfortable. Most of all, I wanted to go back home and be done with this whole ordeal. My curiosity had been sated, forever.\n\n“Alright, let’s do what we are going to do,” Naomi said, motioning with her head towards my little Toyota. “We still have a nearly full tank thank God. I am not feeling in the mood to walk 70.9 miles or more.”\n\nWe crammed into the car, Naomi driving, me in the passenger seat and Max in the back. We all had our guns out, but for a while the road was clear. I felt watched but saw nothing except the occasional glittering of eyes from the forest. A few times a fox or a few deer would run out in front of the car and Naomi would slam on the brakes and let them pass. Still, the sun did not rise.\n\nBecause the dirt road had so many potholes and branches on it, the going was relatively slow. After a couple hours of traveling at fifteen or twenty miles an hour, we pulled over for some food. There was a small dirt turnaround on the side that we slid into before turning off the headlights and engine. At first all we heard was the clicks and pings of the cooling engine.\n\nFar off behind us we heard more of those screams from the monstrosities we had first encountered, which were soon after answered by a chorus of others scattered in all different directions. Max passed out peanut butter crackers and bottled sweet tea from the supplies in the back seat and, for a while, we all ate in silence.\n\n“How far have you gone up this road, Max?” Naomi asked. Her sudden words caused me to jump in the dark and slightly tighten my finger around the trigger. Thankfully the safety was on and there was no risk of blowing out the windshield or shooting through the engine.\n\n“I’ve gone up a little farther than this,” he said quietly. “There should be a few cabins coming up on the left, all painted a dark red. This trip with you two has been much easier than the ones I made on my own… knock on wood. Maybe there is power in numbers after all.”\n\nAfter we finished eating, we continued driving slowly on. Sure enough, after another twenty minutes or so, the headlights illuminated a dark red cabin on the left, the screen door left open and flapping in the light wind. Farther off in the woods behind it we saw another cabin with the windows smashed out, a dead generator behind it. Another fifty feet ahead was the final one of the lot, a cabin that had burned down and only left behind a blackened skeleton of itself.\n\n“That wasn’t like that before,” he said, pointing to the burned out shell of a cabin. I shook my head.\n\n“Doesn’t matter. We aren’t staying here anyway,” I said. But Naomi stopped the car and flipped off the headlights.\n\n“What about those generators?” she asked.\n\n“What about them?” I asked.\n\n“They could have gasoline,” she said.\n\n“Or they could have propane,” Max said. “How much do you even know about generators? I don’t think most run on gas.”\n\n“We need to look, just in case,” Naomi said. “If they have gas or if there are gas containers anywhere around here then we need to grab every drop. We don’t know how long our current supply will last.” I sighed, turned the safety off on my gun and motioned for her to get out.\n\nWe all left the car at the same time, our guns at the ready. The breeze felt warm, as if the further we went down the road, the more we left behind our cold New England climate.\n\nBehind the cabins, we heard chanting, perfectly in unison. As soon as I heard them, a hot breeze began to blow, making my eyes water. It drove away the chill in my bones instantly, and within a few seconds I started to sweat, my heart racing as the chanting grew faster. I looked from Max to Naomi, and saw they felt it too. Their eyes widened and sweat began to pop out on their foreheads and cheeks.\n\n“You got your game face on?” I asked Max, the most experienced shooter among us. He nodded.\n\n“Turn your safeties off if they are on and be ready to shoot for center mass,” he said. He motioned for us to hide behind the nearest cabin. That was all the time we had before we saw a line of people come from behind the burnt cabin.\n\nAt first I thought we were seeing Buddhist monks. They had the same shaved heads and downcast eyes. They all wore identical robes, but instead of the orange hue of Buddhism, these robes were jet black. The language they chanted sounded like Sanskrit.\n\nA dozen of them huddled in front of the burnt cabin, with a thirteenth bringing a naked woman. She was bound, blindfolded and gagged, with signs of torture all over her body. Someone had carved occult symbols into her belly and legs, and drops of blood still pooled and fell beneath her as she writhed on the deer hide stretcher that he dragged behind him. He laid her in the center of the circle, and they all moved their sandaled feet closer to her until they stood mere inches away. The chanting grew louder and her eyes grew wider. Then they moved back rapidly, moving their heads back and forward in a rhythmic motion in the direction of the burnt cabin. The chanting quieted as a horrific being rose out of the ruins of the fire.\n\nIt looked as if he took pieces of himself from the ruins. His skin was the texture of charred wood, his joints had rusty nails and he screeched an inhumanly loud cry as he ripped away from the burnt out cabin. The remains of the cabin all immediately fell into a heap. The creature’s eyes looked like orbs of burning red fire as he stood ten feet tall, looking down at all the quiet faces of the downcast monks before his attention focused on the naked woman.\n\nAt that moment, I felt a gentle tap on my arm. It was Naomi. She leant close to my ear and whispered, “Screw looking for more fuel, we need to get out of here- now.” She pointed to the car. Luckily the cabins and trees had obscured the view of the car from the monks but we couldn’t count on that continuing indefinitely.\n\n“Wait a few seconds,” I said. “I think we need to see this.”\n\nThe creature knelt down to the bound woman. I could see her widening eyes and her thrashing but they had bound her too tight. It opened its mouth wide, a cavernous abyss, and began to scream mere inches from her face.\n\nThe torrent of echoing noise made me clasp my ears in pain, but I continued to watch in terror as the wall of sound began to rip at the woman’s skin. It tore off her gag and bindings, then her hair and eyes followed. But as her healthy pink skin tore away, it was replaced by the marble white paleness of the monstrosities we had encountered first. New cataract-stricken milky eyes emerged from the ruins of her former human eyes. Simultaneously, her mouth ripped from ear to ear in a terrifying smile. Hundreds of crooked teeth seemed to grow from her gums as she gnashed at her tongue, finally chewing it off and spitting it on the ground in a bloody heap. In this entire transformation, the black-clad monks never moved but simply stared, impassive.\n\nRising from her spot on the ground, she began walking on all fours, crab-walking backwards. Her joints cracked and her tendons creaked as her black hair dragged on the leaves behind her. Then she scurried off into the woods, towards the direction we had come.\n\n“Another guard for the sacred forest,” the tallest monk said, stepping forward. His bronze skin reflected the moonlight as he stared up at the creature.\n\n“Jason,” Max whispered in my ear, “we need to go RIGHT NOW.” I nodded and we began to silently slink back to the car, keeping the cabins between us and the monks as much as possible. None raised the alarm as we reached the car and very gently closed the doors, trying to avoid slamming them. Naomi started the engine. I held my breath, praying no one would hear the doors close or the engine start.\n\nMy prayers apparently failed, because a few moments later, the red-eyed monster came sprinting out from between the three cabins, looking frantically around before seeing our car and galloping towards us. Naomi hit the gas and the car jumped forward. Max sat in the back seat, holding his AR-15 on the back seat covers so he could begin filling the creature with bullets if it came too close.\n\nAt first it gained on us, even with the accelerator pressed all the way down. The car hit a massive pothole and Naomi instinctively braked and swerved, allowing the charred arm of the creature to come down and rake the back windshield. It exploded inwards, peppering Max with safety glass. Max fired rapidly out the back window. I saw the long arm of the creature explode as it reached towards us, then its fiery red eyes fell into a hundred pieces as a bullet caught it directly in the middle of its head. The rest of its body immediately started decomposing, thousands of pieces of small ash and larger charred wood being blown in the wind until it disappeared like a disintegrating mirage.\n\n“Oh my God,” I said, breathless, “that was a close one.” Max looked forward at me, still as cool as a cucumber, without a drop of sweat on his forehead. “Don’t you ever get frazzled, Max?” I asked.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot in my time as an agent,” he said. “It takes a lot to rattle me.”\n\n“Well, we didn’t get any more fuel,” Naomi said, “but I think we learned something integral back there. Apparently there are people here raising at least some of these creatures. Maybe some sort of cultists.”\n\n“But how did they get here? And how do they not get ripped apart by the monsters in these forests?” I asked. Naomi shrugged.\n\n“If I had to guess, maybe they have some sort of sigil or marker. And they sounded like they were speaking in some sort of ancient Indian language, maybe Pali or Sanskrit, or perhaps another proto-Aryan dialect. That could indicate that they are following something ancient, as those were the ancient sources for most of the chants in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. If these monks are some sort of schism that practices sacrifices or raises demons, then they could be thousands of years old.” Naomi shrugged. “Unless we can talk to one of them, I doubt we will ever know for sure.”\n\n“I have a feeling we will end up seeing them again,” I said. “Whatever evil they’re doing here must be a part of this road.”\n\nWe continued driving in silence for a while. My hammering heart started to slow down after a few minutes, and with the adrenaline out of my system I began to feel tired. It felt like I had been here for weeks instead of just a night. Checking my phone, I saw it was already 9 in the morning, and still the sun had not risen.\n\nWe pulled over for a break to use the bathroom, or what passed for it with only trees and bushes around. The moon was full but had a reddish-orange hue covering it, similar to what I had seen in lunar eclipses.\n\nThe car continued plodding along slowly, going twenty miles an hour past the constant potholes and the swaying trees and bushes on both sides. Occasionally I would see silver eyes staring out from between the bushes, sometimes they looked like they were on silhouettes that were fifteen feet tall. I didn’t know what was out there in the dark and didn’t want to know. So we just kept on driving and talking, none of us wanting to think about what would happen when we inevitably ran out of fuel. The tank was, after all, already seven-eighths empty, and I doubted we would find any gas stations on this road. When the car stopped, we would have to continue on foot. But to what? What were the Death Cap Mountains, and could we get back to the regular towns we knew from there?\n\nAs we drove on, clearings opened up the view. Many miles in the distance I could see the silhouette of dark mountains that stood high overhead. There was also what appeared to be a radio or phone tower not far away. My phone had no service but as we drew near, a weak wireless internet network appeared on my phone under the name “Emergency services 772”. After fifteen minutes we saw it next to the road, with a dirt turnaround in front of it. It had stairs going up in a helix on the edge of the tower. The wifi was too weak to get a connection down in the car.\n\n“I want to go up the tower,” I said. “Maybe we could see further down the road, and hopefully even get some internet. I want to write an account of what we have seen in case we never make it home. Seeing as the visitor’s center could connect to the internet from the real world, I think the wireless connection here might be able to also.” Max consented with a grunt, but Naomi seemed unsure.\n\n“Is it really worth it? And even if we do contact people on the other side of the barrier, what if it just encourages someone to come looking for this road? We could be responsible for their death,” Naomi said.\n\n“Maybe,” I said. “Maybe that’s why they leave internet connections throughout the path. It could just be a way to trap new people who think this is just some fake story.” I frowned. “But we have to try. If even one person could be warned away, we have to try.” With that, I got out of the car and approached the metal staircase. I heard Max and Naomi follow me.\n\nThe stairs seemed to rise fifteen stories in the air, a circular pattern that hugged the three thick metal poles that rose into the air. Looking down, I could see all the way to the bottom through the metal vents that composed the staircase. It did not inspire confidence. Every time I looked down, my stomach would flip and a shot of adrenaline would reach out to the very tips of my fingers and toes. I had never liked heights.\n\nThere was a thin steel banister that ran on the inner dimension of the stairs, and I gripped it the entire way up until my knuckles were white. I counted the steps to take my mind off the height, but lost count after around 1700 stairs. This was, by far, the highest tower I had ever been on.\n\nNevertheless, we ended up getting to the top without any issue. I checked my phone and, to my relief, I did have full wifi access now. But the light from my phone illuminated something far less cheerful across the observation deck.\n\nTen black, twisted fingers held to the side of the deck, as if someone was hanging by the tips of their fingers there, fifteen stories in the air. My heart leapt into my throat as I realized that whoever was there must have been hanging since at least before I got there.\n\n“Hello?” I asked, drawing nearer. There was no response, not even a breath or a sigh. As I drew closer, I saw the nails were long, twisted and sickly-looking. They looked like they had dried blood and dirt shoved underneath them, debris which had festered for months into a black goo.\n\nSomething in my gut told me to avoid the fingers. I went ten feet to the right, as wide a berth as I could give them, and looked over the railing to the thing hanging below. With a glance back, I saw that both Max and Naomi had stopped at the top step, sensing danger and refusing to come up to the observation deck with me until they understood what was happening.\n\nThe moonlight illuminated the thing’s shiny black skin, which glinted like the carapace of a beetle. Its arms were far too long for a human being, looking more like a chimpanzee in its proportions. Its pure white eyes stared over at me for a moment before it shrieked and began swinging over to me, one hand over the other, and tried to pull me over the side. I fell back with a cry as its fingers swiped the air mere centimeters in front of my shirt. If it had grabbed me, I know without a doubt I would be dead.\n\nI fell down to the observation deck, looking through the metal grating down fifteen stories and feeling like I would vomit from terror at any moment. Thankfully at that moment, Max ascended the last step and took aim with his rifle. He hit the creature directly in the center of its chest, sending it flying backwards. Four or five seconds later, I heard a heavy thud as it slammed into the hard dirt and rocks below.\n\nI tried to get back to my feet but first, I threw up through the metal vents. My heart was beating so fast that I thought it would explode. I focused on my breathing and slowly calmed myself down.\n\nNaomi had brought up some water and protein bars. We sat and ate and drank in silence as I wrote this up and posted it. In the distance, I could see the massive mountains beckoning me on. From up here, they looked so close that I felt I could jump from here to there with long enough legs. But of course, it was just an optical illusion, as they still had to be at least twenty or thirty miles away.",

        "text": "Our little team of four are made of paleontologists and archeologists, two of us were this the other two were that, so there was always your partner to discuss anything you found. We came to Hungary last week and settled in a camp where we resided in a two floor wooden house. Two of us shared a room on the first floor, there were two rooms, on the ground floor were the kitchen and the bathroom.\n\nOur excavation site is in the Bakony mountain near to our camp. There wasn't any problems or anything special, though only Thomas speaks Hungarian so it's a bit difficult to communicate with the people around here.\n\nUntil the fifth of July, I found a very weird skeleton under a rolled boulder. I was alone because my teammates were working on something Sam found. So I decided to excavate it, alone. It took me hours to get the stone off of one side of it. But I couldn't believe what was I looking at. The creature was around 220 cm tall and 3 meters long whit tail, the front and the hind legs were nearly the same length so it could walk on four and two legs, a long whip like tail to balance the weight of the creature when it was on it's hind legs, the head was really weird. It resembles a human skull but it's a bit elongated, at the back of the skull were some small spike like bones poking out–probably there was skin between like a sail– , the teeth were implementing this was a carnivorous animal, but these teeth were a little thin, but long and very durable.\n\nAfter examining the skeleton I realised that I haven't brought my camera, so I needed to go back to our camp. I got back, grabbed the camera and headed back to the place. But when I got back, there was nothing in the rocks. I was scared as fuck, so I took out my flashlight to search the area. I didn't get far when I heard something moving near me I got scared. I looked aroundto find the source of the noise.\n\nI turned around and noticed a large grey creature, it looked like a dinosaur. I screamed and I ran. I turned on the flashlight to see if I can spot it. The light fell in the eyes of it and it took off running. It chased me but I was too fast so it couldn't catch up with me. I ran to the nearest tree and climbed up, I broke a branch that hit it's head. It left, but I didn't trust that. It was started to get dark so I climbed down to find nothing there, so I went back to our camp. Before I couldget in the house I heard a growling sound from behind, it was here. Grey, reptilian skin, a mouth somewhat showing the long pointy teeth, a little sail made of small bones and skin Iin-between them, and a slightly yellow pair of hypnotising eyes.\n\nAs I looked at it I freaked out and dropped on the ground. It started to get closer,so I got up and ran inside and slammed the door. The thing scratchedon the door, walked around trying to get in. I sat there,  my heart racing. Sam woke up to the noise and came to see what is going on.\n\n\"What are you doing? Sholdn'you be asleep in our room?\" she asked.\n\n\"There's a... a dinosaur like this at the door!\"\n\n\"You can't be serious.\"\n\n\"I am fucking serious, it's outside and trying to get in, it chased me before.\"\n\n\"I hear nothing\"\n\n\"What? It was scraping the door a minute ago.\"\n\n\"Should we check what your 'dinosaur' was doing?\"\n\nI hardly agree and we go outside. The thing was nowhere to be found, but there was writing in the ground saying:\n\n\"Gyere vissza oda hol megtaláltad holnap éjjel. Elmondom mit tudnotok kell és mit szeretnétek hallani\"\n\nWe didn't understand it so we woke up Thomas and asked him to translate. He told us it says \"Come back where you found it tomorrow night. I will tell everything you need to know and what you desire to learn\"\n\nWe stood there with confusion but decided to go back to bed and try to sleep, but this time I opened the window to see if I can catch sight of the creature, I didn' success, so I went to bed, but coldn't sleep. What is that monstrous creature? What does it want? Who wrote that message? Was it the beast or someone else? These questions kept me up at that night.\n\nIt was very quiet at the camp this night, and I haven't slept much, so I didn't notice when Thomas walked in our room.\n\n\"I was thinking about the message that your 'found one' left behind\" said Thomas\n\nSam was still sleeping.\n\n\"What about it?\" I said.\n\n\"I think it is trying to tell us something\"\n\n\"Maybe the monster left it behind.\"\n\n\"It could be.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm stupid? No of course not. It must have been someone who saw you. We need to find anythink useful they might left behind\"\n\nI put on some new clothes that I brought from home. I was ready to go and Thomas helped me in dragging my backpack as well. We walked to the place where I found the skeleton.\n\n\"It left a clue, what should it be?\" I asked Thomas as we walked up the river.\n\n\"They was definitely writing the message for you. If they want to tell anybody what's going on.\"\n\nWe got there, it was the same as I left it. Empty, whitout any mark or any lead we could follow.\n\n\"Damn. A dead end, there aren't anything we can follow! I think we need to come back at night, then they might tell us something useful.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good idea. Let's go back to the camp.\"\n\nWe headed back and got things done, eventually the evening came. Thomas and I didn't sleep much, when we woke up we decided to see if the they was keeping their promise or not. So we walked to the site again, and as soon as we got there, Thomas pointed his flashlight in the rocks and it hit something, it was our messenger.\n\n\" So you decided to come\" he said with a very broken English, but we understood it.\n\n\"We came for answers!\" I said as he sat down on a rock in front of us.\n\n\" I'll tell you everything you need then you can ask whatever you want.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Great! As I know you four are working on an excavation site. and you\" he pointed at me \"freed the monster whowas tuck in the limestone.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is Tibor, but you can call me Tibi.\"\n\n\"So... Tibi... what is that creature?\"\n\n\"His name is Rega, the pet of an acient god. The other gods didn't like Rega because he was powerful, so not so long ago they sent him here,  deprived of most of his power. Twenty years ago he got caught in a landslide, and you freed him.\"\n\n\"How long has he been here?\"\n\n\"Not longer than a hundred years.\" he tilted his head \"You need to know that you can't dig here any more, because this place is his territory, but if you do, he will hunt you down until either you end yourself or he kills you. So be careful.\"\n\n\"Okay. We will be careful.\"\n\n\"Then goodbye, and good luck finding anything interesting.\" he got up and walked into the dark forest before we could say anything.\n\n\"We need to tell the girls what he told us!\"\n\n\"Yeah\" we headed back to our camp and told the girls everything, unless the exact place where we went so they not even by accident could take anything from there.\n\nThe next day we decided to relax and went down to the Balaton. We got back in the afternoon and rested a bit exept for Anne, she still got energy so she decided to take a walk, maybe evenbring back something. We let her and put on a horror movie.\n\nShe got back at night giving us a jump as she slammed the door.\n\n\"You nearly gave me a heart attack!\"\n\n\"Why did you jump that big?\" she asked sarcastically\n\nI pointed at the TV as the monster jumpscared Thomas and Sam\n\n\"Damn, did I just miss that? Anyway, how was your walk?\"\n\n\"It was refreshing. I even found a cool vase.\"\n\n\"Oh, where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Up the river.\"\n\nMy heart sipped a beat. \"You need to get rid of that immediatly!\"\n\n\"Aren't we supposed to dig up old bones and stuff?\"\n\n\"Not from THAT place!\"\n\n\"What? Is this thing cursed? Am I gonna die? OOoooOOooo.\"\n\n\"Anne this is serious, you need to bring that thing back where you found it or else you-\"\n\nWe heard a loud bang outside and a blood curdling roar.The lights went out. Rega is here.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!\" Sam asked as she grabbed for a flashlight\n\n\"It's him, he came for Anne because she took from where we shouldn't have!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me where was that place?!\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't find it!\" I ran to the front door and looked out from the window next to it. He was there growling in anger, when he saw me he rammed against the door.We felt as the wooden house trembled as threw himself against the main door.\n\n\"This won't stand for long get anything useful and get to our room!\" he threw himself against the door and there wasa hole in the door, he stuck his hand inside trying to grab something. I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and stabbed his hand. He hissed but didn't pull it out, he tried to grab me as he swung his hand in my direction. His claws ripped in my clothes and broke up some of the planks on the floor.\n\n\"JIM GET UP HERE NOW!\" I heard Anne shouting\n\nI ran upstairs, salm the door behind myself as I hear loud crackle of the main door.\n\n\"We need to barricade this door.\" I said as I tipped the cabinet over that was next to the door. They pushed a bed together and we flipped it.\n\nWe heard as he tried to get in the bedroom. He stopped, he walked out what we didn't understand. Then I saw the glowing orange eyes in the window turning blood red, and a furious loud roar. Somehow he climbed up on the walls to the bedroom window after seeing that he can't get the bedroom door to break.\n\nWe retreated and started to search for any tool or material we could use as a weapon. Meanwhile he punched the glass of the window and managed to brake one of the glass panels.He tried to get inside growling and hissing when Thomas shut the other panel in his face. He only got his head and one arm in when I grabbed a broom, broke it and stabbed his eye. He screeched in pain and got more angry, I tried to stab him again but he grabbed the broom and broke it without effort, he used the broken piece in his hand to hit Sam as he throw it at her trying to hit me. She fell on the floor with a bleeding head and Thomas rushed to help her. Then there was a gunshot, Rega screeched in pain and fell out of the window on the ground with a loud thud. It was Anne, she used Thomas's gun he bought with himself.\n\n\"Finally oyur gun is useful for something. Is it dead? I aimed for his head.\"\n\n\"I doubt it.\" I looked out of the window to see the beast get up shaking, he looked at me and ran to the side of the house. \"Is Sam okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah. She got hit hard, but she will be fine.\" said Thomas as he bandaged Sam's wounds\n\n\"We need to get out of here, he will not give up this easily. We must call the police or some authority to get us out of here.\"\n\n\"I don't want to interrupt you Jim but do you also hear a hissing sound or did he hit my head really hard?\" Sam asked\n\n\"No I also hear it\" the air was smelling like rotting eggs. \"Fuck, there's a gas leak! We need to get out of here quick!\"\n\n\"How? We can only climb out or the window!\"\n\n\"Then we are going there! I will go first and find a ladder.\" But as I looked out of the window to escape I saw him. I froze in place as he held a burning plank looking right in my eyes, he let out a sound that resembled laughing. I stood there as Anne got next to me and she also froze. He smiled and tossed the plank in the house.\n\n\"REGA YOU SON OF A-\" and the gas exploded. I woke up lying on the ground, unable to move, debris and fire everywhere and him standing there cornering Anne who could barely stand, she bitterly cried. I saw Thomas standing behind and shooting him in the head, he merely flinched. He looked at him in fury, swung his tail sending Thomas flying into a spear like piece of wood, piercing and killing him instantly. Then he turned to Anne.\n\nHe grabbed her with one hand, he smashed her into the ground three times breaking her spine, she cried in pain, but he wasn't finished, he tore one of her legs off, blood on the ground and him. I heard sirens and blue lights approaching, so did he. He broke Anne's neck and ran off into the dense forest. I couldn't stay awake longer, I fainted.\n\nI woke up in a hospital in the same room as Sam. One of my legs missing, scars and burnmarks over my body. Sam wasn't better, as she told me she needed a surgery because of how much wood debris drilled into her abdomen. She said my left leg was in a worse shape, so it was amputated, the debris is also the cause of our scars. We spent a whole month in the hospital recovering, and planning for the future.\n\nAs I'm writing this I'm out of the hospital and gearing up for a trip to end an unfinished business. Let's go to the Bakony! Who's coming?\n\n(Thank you for reading! It's my first time posting here and English isn't my first language, so there are plot and grammar mistakes plus over explanation. I want your honest opinion and critics are welcome, at least it's a learning opportunity.)",

        "text": " [Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ztysnt/my_boss_has_been_taking_women_into_his_office_and/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always hated spirit mediums.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're inconsiderate assholes, usually in gaudy clothes and fake accents, scamming people out of their money and using their dead loved ones to do it. It's a despicable, dishonest career and to this day I will always hate the fame and money people like Ed and Lorraine Warren got with this scam. Even if I do like their movies. During late nights when my brother Ronnie isn't working part time at Mooyah's we'll watch bad reality tv shows that involve mediums and debate if they're legit or not. I always win.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, Boston doesn't share my point of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMadame Esmerelda was a tall, lanky middle aged woman with an obvious fake tan and red hair so poorly dyed the grey roots looked like they were waging war with it. She wore typical gaudy, chunky jewelry and flowey, layered clothes you'd expect from someone like her. She even wore ankle bracelets. Apparently, she worked with Boston every now and then, and while that should have made me believe she had at least a grasp on what she was doing...I found myself doubting it. She'd met us at the Denny's where I'd spoken to Boston three nights ago and when I walked in she was already going on about how she didn't like scruffy, who sat in his usual seat on the other side of the restaurant, very clearly able to hear her from where she stood at the front. The guy always made me feel uneasy but I honestly felt bad for him. There he sat, stained as usual, eyes bloodshot and bagged from a clear lack of sleep, a few bruises on his face, just trying to eat his damn meal while this crazy white lady was going on and on to Boston about how his 'Ka' was wrong and he was 'clearly dangerous, like a wild beast'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made eye contact with scruffy and he almost seemed to smile when I rolled my eyes and gave him the universal gesture for 'this bitch crazy'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Kid, there you are.\" Boston greeted me when he noticed my arrival. He'd made me stay home the last three days to try and recuperate from what we found in the alley. That poor woman. At least it gave me a chance to spend the holiday with Ronnie, he got me Pokemon ultra moon, the newest game in the franchise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I told you, my name is Libby.\" \"Well you should pick a new name to use.\" He replied, \"You don't want anyone we chase down to track you by your name, right?\" He had a point. \"I'll think about it. Shouldn't your friend be a little quitter if she's going to talk about someone in earshot?\" I gave the woman, who's name I didn't know at the time, a frown. One she returned. \"*I* am Madame Esmerelda, seer of the dead and the truth, tool for spirits to speak through and share their knowledge. And you are...*Libby*, it seems.\" She said my name with distain, and the feeling was mutual. Before I could react she reached out and grabbed my face, turning it this way and that, running her fingers along my cheekbone and jawline. I felt very uncomfortable. She even pulled my glasses away and held my eye open, staring into it. After giving a huff she let go, handing me back my glasses. \"There is nothing special about this girl. You should send her home before she gets too involved and hurt.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell that was a load of shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Trust me, Esmerelda, I know what I'm doing with this one.\" Boston assured her. This woman was proving to have zero sense of personal space as she snatched one of my hands and held it palm up, dragging a long green nail across it. Frowning, she pulled my hand up closer to her eyes. A palm reading. I knew of them of course, nearly everyone knows of them in this day and age. Back in high school, well one of my high schools, a goth guy gave me a palm reading. He told me I would die in a house full of strangers, and that an axe would be involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You are, as I said, nothing special.\" Esmerelda said, still running her nails over my palm lines, \"Nothing you have done in your life up until now has been important and nothing you do after this in your life will be important. You watched Freedom die, that was all.\" That last part caught me off guard. \"What..was that?\" I asked. \"I said, nothing you do after this in your life will be important.\" Esmerelda replied, as if she never said anything about freedom. Boston grabbed my wrist and pulled it from her grasp. \"That's enough of that, Esme, the kid is sticking around and that's final. Now stop bothering her and the poor guy back there and let's get to the scene.\" He then dropped my hand and turned to leave the Denny's without another word. I shot Esmerelda a frown and quickly went after him, shoving my hands into my jacket pockets. Anyone who knows Ohio knows how awful the cold is this time of year. Just another reason to hate this place. \"You seen your boss around lately?\" Boston asked over his shoulder. I shook my head, \"No, I was just pulling some overtime during the break that day. I haven't stepped foot in the school since.\" \"Good, good. Then we're returning to the crime scene...will you be okay with that?\" This time he actually glanced back at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought back to a comment I got on here, about how I should really get my whole puking thing under control if I was going to be involved in this investigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a good thing I decided to skip lunch when Boston came calling. I'm still not sure how he got my number though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm good.\" I gave Boston a nod and he gave me a crooked half smile before pulling his hat over his eyes and turning down the next alley. When we got closer to the crime scene Esmerelda pushed past me and followed Boston as he stepped over the yellow tape. The cops had already cleaned up everything. Now all that was left was a smell and dried blood, and a homeless woman crouched near a dumpster in the far corner. Not too strange considering the area we were in. The other two didn't acknowledge her so neither did I.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes..\" Esmerelda began, lifting her arms in the air just as the wind picked up, causing the long sleeves to billow in the air dramatically. \"I can sense a presence here, yes. You said this was a scene of violence, correct?\" She turned to face Boston, arms still outstretched. \"Yeah, a girl last seen with my suspect.\" As they spoke I noted the woman near the dumpster shift in her position, head lifted to watch us now. My blood turned cold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Boston...\" I tried, but Esmerelda spoke over me, her tone louder as if to drown me out. God, I hate her already. \"Yes, I sense the girl. She is here.\" She walked slowly towards the corner, but not the one the girl sat in. \"She is here. Yes. Here. Dear, hello? Can you hear me? I am Madame Esmerelda. What is your name?\" She looked like a nutter, talking to that empty corner. I looked back to the girl, who was now twitching her head to the side uncomfortably. Like the jerky movements from a Japanese horror movie. Something was vibrating nearby. Esmerelda carried on, \"Elizabeth Witt..that's a lovely name, dear. A very lovely name.\" And one that she could have just gotten off the news yesterday when they reported on the murder. The urge to roll my eyes was so hard it actually hurt. \"I sense you want to tell us what happened, yes? You can talk to me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy now the girl had stood, and she looked *pissed*. She walked towards Esmerelda, her movements still jerky and I was thankful that, despite how close she'd gotten to me, she didn't seem to pay me any mind at all. She got right up in Esmerelda's face, screaming at her, but nothing was coming out. Instead, that vibrating noise grew more frequent. I had an idea what was going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen ghosts for as long as I could remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember how I said I immediately knew that Esmerelda was full of shit? Yeah.\n\nI made my way to the dumpster as the vibrating continued and Esmerelda continued asking her questions, unable to hear the ghost of the dead girl no matter how hard she pretended. I got down on my hands and knees and reached under the dumpster, groping around until my hand closed around something small and hard. I pulled it out and knew I'd been right on the money. A grey flip phone, adorned with some cute bear charms. It had 6 messages already. I flipped the phone open and was greeted with the background image of Elizabeth Witt and some girl on the quad of the university. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe'd gone to my school. She looked so happy. Poor girl \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new image popped up. I clicked on it, and it lead to a flurry of texts with no number attached. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I can hear you.** \n\n**I didn't answer you.** \n\n**You aren't even looking at me.** \n\n**Liar.** \n\n**Shut up!**\n\n**Stop!**\n\n**s̸̢̨̜̦̭̘̉͊̍͛͂͘͜h̴͉̺̦͍̩̯͓̟̎̃͗͘͜u̴̝͕̺͇̰͚̣͎̲̝̘͓̰̣̾́͒̆̏̀͂̚t̸̝̰̺̞̽̊̈́̈́̔͗̓̈̉͊̀͝͠ ̵̦̥͉̭̙̙̞̦̣̘̬͍̺̣͛̉ͅứ̵̪͈̳̥̘͍̯̞̞͈̖̱̝̜̂͑̿̊̒̾͑͒ṕ̵͔̯͚̦̦̝̥̹̉̈́̃͐̈́̽͝**\n\n**̸̯̆̓̂͑̃͗̄͛̓̕͝͝͝͝s̴̨̬̳̬̘̳̻̭̹͇̳̜͎̦̑̅̋̊̈́̑͘h̷͎̩͓͚̿̆̈́̈́ṳ̵̡̮̪̠̻͓͕͇̞̠̖͇̰̙̍̑͑͒̈́̑̍̽̚͝͠͠t̵̡̧̖̞̹͉̺͕̭̉̎̇̂̆̑͗̄͘ ̴̪̥̟̉̓̇ų̴̢̣̬̱̮̮̬̝̖̤̅p̷͉̫̥̖͚͉̲̲̍̂̎͆̏̓͋́͂̕͠**\n\n**̸̭̪̥̎̌͂̃̀͂̆̉͑̆̾̎̒͠s̸̢̧̛͕͈͉̳̫̺̠̮̤͋̽̔͐͒̌̎̄͌̒͗̆̆h̷̡̭̲̦͇̗̝̀̇͆̓̃͝͝ū̶̝̔ṱ̴̨̨̫̭̣͂̈́̌̎̄̓̔̓͆̈́͒̿͘͝͠ ̴̪̞̻̺͎̗̼̇͑͛̆̌̾̂́́̀̚̚͝͠ụ̴̇͂͠͠ṕ̷̨̨̪̺̰͍͈̟̘̺̻̦̆̀̄̕ͅ**\n\n**̵̨̨̨̧̣͍͚̞̗̦̻͖̉͐̋̔͛ͅs̶͇̫̠̅̐͝h̴̠̗̘̩̩̦͓͖̫͙̦̠̍̈̀͂́̌̃̽̌̕͜u̷̳͔̙͉̦̲̺̼͔̬̫̞͉͊͑̾͘̕͜͝ͅt̷̮͙̲͊̈́̂̀̏̓̈́̿̎̌̆̀͝ͅ ̷͈̥̜̱͊̇͌̓̎u̷̡̨̡̗̠͍̙̣͕͎̖̗͓͋̏̋̽̑̌̇͌͠͠ͅp̵̢̳͖̥̬̍̑͝**\n\n**̵͈͚̪͍̽̍̽̅̃́̈́̌̈́̄͘͝s̴̩̣̪͚̹͖͖̻̱͍̣̙̦̪͔͊ḧ̶̯̦́̐̀͊̂̾͜͝͝ų̷͇͔̞͂̀ţ̴̹͓͔͔̏͠ ̶̛͍͕̜̻͙̆͒̉̉͒͌͌͂͒͑͑̚̚͠ủ̵͉͚̳̄͆̈́ṗ̵̜͍**\n\n**̵̧͖͓͓̗̼̱̯̻̥̾̒̊͂̕͠͠s̴̡̼̳̈́̓̇̆̾̉h̷̨̟͈̯̳̼̥̄̄͛̕u̵̧̼̪̦͇͎̣̝̜̻͒̒͜t̷̖̙̠̞͐̆̃̑̐̐̃̂ ̴̦̻̣̲̜͙̜͐̄̿͐̑̈́͒̾̅͘̕͝ư̵̠̰̦͚̮̦̲͈̙̟̥̞͐̍̾͗̋̈́̃̿͛̓͊͜͠p̷̧̛͓͔̮̣̗͓̮͍͕͕̯͉̤̓̎͌̃́̀̓̊͘̚**\n\n**̵̟͖̟̈́̊̍s̵̨͈͓͍͐̐̽͆̈́h̷͎̪͓͓̩̮̫́͋̔͗̀͂̂͌̀̀u̸̧̧̡̟̙̖̳̜͎̅ͅt̴̢͙͕̲̖̺͊͂͋͝ͅ ̴͚͕̠̯̈́̇͒̎͜u̶̮̮̠̬̥̻̝͉͍͉̿́́͜p̶̡̛̝̜̻̬̙̗̰͔͌̀̓͜͝͝**\n\n**̷̛̘̭̹̱̩͙̻̞̞̩͕̘̯̬͚͑̇͗̂͂̋̔͂̏͝͠s̷̢̼͎̠̼̭̗̮̱̻̻̱̀͌͑̍͆̃͝ͅh̴̖̥͔͙͖͔̯̮̻̬̞̫͓̹͗̌̔̀́̀̈́̃͋̿͂̄͘͜u̸͍͈̙͓̥̣̰̟̻͕̕ṫ̶̗̯͔̖̰͕͇̻͆̀̎̑̑̚ ̴̨͓̪̥͚͇͎͎̼͖̫͈̎̈́̌̒̆̐̄̂̐͋̈́̂̆͝͝ú̵̢̪̠̗̱̥̩͉̖p̷̓̋̀͌̔̂͜**\n\n**̵̬̳͉͈̮̮̖̦̪̜̇̽̑͗̆͜͝͠ş̵̨̞͎̜͉̘͕̣͂h̷̼͖̟̔̀̔̀̄͘ú̷̲͖̺͈̱̗͎̫͈̖̻̩̫̲͂̑̓͊̃̇̆͒̀̒̈́͜ţ̷̡̣̹̘͖͉̼̩̼̲͙̜̟̉̽̆̽̍͑̂̚ ̶̧̨̛̭̪͖̗͉̩̤͉̣͔̗̹̳́̂̑́͗̀̋̎̏ư̶͇̋̆͂̌̒̒́p̵̝͈̗̟̪̖̙̣͖̹̌̾́͋͊̊͛͘͜**\n\n**̵͍̯̦̗̠͓͉̱̇͊̎̑́̀͒͆̈́̈́͂̚s̶̛̝̱͚͑͛̿̆̓̕͝ḫ̵͉̥̬͕̌̂̈ͅu̸͇͛͂t̸̪̼͓̞̰͇̫͍͂̽͊̈́̉̇̊̃̑͛͝ ̴͔̯̹̺̗̫̲̱̇̈́͠u̵̧̬͈̱͖͈̟̝̝̅͗͆͊͊͒̚ͅp̶̧̲̓̈͛̇͛͗͂̒͋͘͝͝**\n\n**̷̡̺̣̺̱̟͐͑̒̃́̎̕͜͝ś̶̫̱̫ḩ̶̞̍̈́ū̴̧̗̱̳͔͕̣̺̖̪̃̈́͝t̶̮͊̋͆̂̑̌̔̀̏̚͝͝͠ ̶̡̡̡̙̭̦̲̦̲̫̱͛̒͆̓̾́͊̌̚͜͠u̷̡̺̜͓͍͓̞͉̞͔̬̹̮̜̘̾̑͂͋͆͊̽̀̐p̷͇̻̂̂̈́̌̉͘**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElizabeth was more angry than any ghost I had ever seen. Text after text after text came in but I couldn't read them anymore. I pushed myself off the ground and stomped over to Esmerelda, who was completely unaware of the ghost girl trying to grab her, trying to scream at her. Another pathetic scam artist. \"Esmerelda.\" I spoke up, but either she couldn't hear me or pretended not to. So I tried again, \"Esmerelda!\" \"I am *working*, child!\" She snapped at me, \"Very important, delicate work. So be a good girl and-\" \"You can't really see her.\" I interrupted her, \"And she *knows*. she's angry at you.\" I shoved the phone in her face as it continued to vibrate in my hand. Color drained from Esmerelda's face as her eyes scanned the messages. She opened her mouth to speak but I was tired of the sound of her voice. I turned to face Elizabeth and froze when I found her mere inches from my face. I could see her, and she knew that now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"....Who killed you?\" I asked. One more message came in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pete Ness.**",

        "text": "This is a very strange story I am about to say. It happened late one night when everyone had gone to bed.\n\n \n\nI was walking down the streets of Bucharest. It was a quiet night, with little traffic and hardly anyone outside. The sight of the empty city at night was truly something to behold. But as beautiful as it was I could not sit idle to enjoy the night city for too long because the chilly wind specific to this time of the day was beckoning me to go home and find something to warm myself with. I started to pick up the pace while thinking about the warm blanket that was waiting for me at home. As I was walking, I suddenly took notice of the nearby park.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no clue what compelled my gaze to stray in that direction. The park should have been completely devoid of life at that hour, but I still looked in its direction. It was as if I was searching for something that should have not been there...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo this day, I still cannot fully understand what I saw that night. That... thing that appeared in the middle of the empty park. The shape of its body made it look like some sort of animal, like a reptile, to be more precise. But it was much too large for any reptile I knew of. In fact, it was so large, that most of its body was covered by the darkness of the night. What I was seeing was only a small part of a much bigger beast...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing I could see clearly was its head, full of countless eyes. Eyes upon eyes upon eyes. Hundreds of them, all looking upwards, towards the stars sparkling in the sky. It looked like the monster did not even notice my presence, for it was far too absorbed in whatever it was doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few seconds later, after my body was finally released from the chains of fear, I started running away like a madman. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran and ran until my legs gave out, and I fell unconscious on the sidewalk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I woke up... in my own bed, at home. I had no recollection of entering my house, but later on, that day, after I talked to my neighbor, he said that he saw me come coming home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears passed by, but I never saw that creature again. To a certain extent, I have started to believe that what happened that night was just a bad dream, or at least that's how I cope with the whole situation. The nightmares have stopped a while ago, and I'd like to think I have gotten over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, on certain nights, I get a strong, almost uncontrollable urge to open my window and look at the sky. When I do this, I always think about what was that creature seeing that terrifying night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n''How beautiful'', I think to myself everytime.",

        "text": "\nI'm not particularly a religious person. I never really connected with the idea of believing in a God or a Devil; something like religion never really resonated with me until the night a few of my friends and I explored the Lockwood house.\n\nMy mother gave me a laptop this morning; she thought that it might help me cope or whatever so here I am, typing what I remember. I haven't been able to sleep; there's a shadow that stands in the corner of my hospital room at night, and sometimes I hear voices inside my head telling me to do things, and I'm terrified. \n\nNo one believes me. They keep stating that my traumatizing experience must have triggered my anxiety. They called it a dissociation or detachment from reality, I think. Whatever. I know that what I saw in that house was real, and what had happened to my friends actually did happen. We just wanted an experience. We never really stopped to evaluate the risks that might come with it. \n\nI guess I'll start from the beginning.\n\nIt was Friday morning, and I decided to kill some time in the library across from my high school. The greatest thing about being in a library was the calming atmosphere. I leaned forward on the worn sofa and rolled my eyes as I turned the page.\n\n*What?* I scoffed. *Why is this even a thing someone would think is even remotely attractive?*\n\n[ I am a lot to handle, but I can assure you that you'll have fun handling me, love ] \n\n*Seriously? I've met drunk perverts hanging outside of bars with better pick up lines than that* I thought to myself. I didn't think it could get any cringier until I read the next line. \n\n[ My heart did an unexpected flip, startled by his bizarrely attractive smile ]\n\nI frowned inwardly. *You know what you really need instead of a creepy-ass stalker boyfriend? A cardiology consult* \n\n\"So annoying,\" I sighed. *How is this tripe a best seller?*\n\n\"What's annoying?\"\n\n\"Oh, shit.\" I squeaked. I sat upright and turned around, instinctively about to clog the person when I realized who it was. Harlen leaned up against the wall with a tilted smirk on his face. He stood between me and the fluorescents. \n\nHarlen was a fellow classmate and a friend of Mark's, who was an older guy Albie, and I guess Harlen hung out with. Harlen was a tall, attractive guy with an athletic build, short obsidian hair, and grey eyes. To quote the main character in the novel, Harlen was the kind of trouble smarter girls than I had fallen into with disastrous results and a few regrets. \n\nMy cheeks flushed and I closed the book as he cocked his head at me. \"Did I seriously scare you?\" He joked, but his smile faltered slightly as I glared up at him. \n\n\"Dude,\" I groaned. \"Don't sneak up on me like that,\"\n\n\"What? I didn't sneak,\" He crossed his arms over his chest in protest. \"No sneaking was involved. I just walked over here. And to be fair, this is a library-silence is sacred in a library so technically we're supposed to sneak. We're also the only ones in here right now anyway, so who cares.\" \n\nMy eyes did a pointed sweep of the decidedly empty area before settling back on Harlen's with an unamused glower. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I'm pretty sure the zero other people in here appreciate the deceptive aura of calm. What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Well, actually I was doing some research for a paper I'm writing for English.\" He tightened his grip on his bookbag. \"I was told I'd find you here,\" He explained. \n\n\"Why?\" I asked. \"I didn't tell anyone that I was here.\" \n\n\"I've got my ways of tracking people down.\"\n\nWhen he saw my expression, Harlen rolled his eyes. \"Oh, come on Kaya. I'm just kidding! Is it really that weird that I happen to be in here the same time as you?\"\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\n\"I'll let you get back to reading, then. Oh,\" He started. \"I almost forgot. Meet us down at the Love Triangle for lunch. I found a cool place for us to urbex.\" \n\nMy friends and I loved urban exploring. Most of the time it was exciting and exhilarating. Sometimes it was a challenge; some places were remote enough that you could simply walk in through the front door like a welcomed visitor. Other times we would be forced to climb up over fences or crawl through windows. \n\nThere was this one time we decided to check out a drainage tunnel because a few people have sworn they heard ominous laughter coming from it. Water seeped into our clothes and we shivered at the coldness. I remember that I cracked a joke about the movie \"IT\" when we suddenly heard a loud BOOM right next to our heads. I have no idea what caused the sound, but I doubt that it was anything paranormal. \n\nI was in the middle of stabbing at a large crouton with my fork when Harlen, Albie, and Jessica took their seats at the table. \n\n\"Hey, Kaya,\" Albie said as he sat down beside me. Albie and I have been friends since we were little. He was a skinny black guy with a box fade haircut and light brown eyes. We were neither popular nor unpopular. We were what some people called, \"drifters\" and, according to Albie, those whose social standings meant that if he made random eye contact with someone in the halls he would probably get a nod back, and maybe even a quick \"Hey\" or \"What's up\" If you didn't know us personally you'd likely assume that we were siblings, especially with the way we acted around each other most of the time.\n\n\"What took you guys so long?\" I asked, pointing my fork in his direction. \n\n\"It was my fault. I'm sorry.\" He grumbled, as he unzipped his lunch bag. \"Mr. Golbloom chastised me for like, ten minutes.\" \n\n\"To be fair, You were looking at your phone in class.\" Jessica said. Jessica was Albie's girlfriend, a petite girl with long blond hair, and hazel eyes. \"And that wasn't the only thing,\"\n\nAlbie sighed. \"You're not wrong, but he's kind of an asshat.\"\n\n\"You should use that filter once in a while,\" Jessica said.\n\n\"Oh baby, since when have you known me to have such a filter?\"\n\n\"Oh please,\" I scoffed. \"You just choose not to use it.\" \n\nAlbie gave me a frown and tossed a baby carrot my way, which I was able to dodge easily. \n\nHarlen cleared his throat as he pulled out his phone. \"So, shall we get to it, then?\" \n\nFrom what we could find, The Lockwood house had been abandoned for years now, but a few people who have walked the trail close to the place have claimed they could see the spirits of the family walking around inside, and others had even heard music coming from the house. When they went to investigate, there was no one inside.\n\nIn 2010 Ethan Lockwood brutally murdered his wife, Anna Lockwood, and her parents Steven and Isabelle Thompson in the middle of the night. Authorities found Anna's parents dead in their bedroom; both of their bodies were in pieces, and their daughter's body was found in the basement. Anna had multiple blunt force head injuries and what's worse, her eyes and tongue were missing. Ethan's body was found in the living room with a shotgun beside him, and a deep laceration on his neck.\n\n\"Get this,\" Harlen said, as he scrolled down. \"There was a survivor - a ten year old boy. He also had a twin brother, but he was never found.\" \n\n\"Holy crap. What happened to the boy who survived?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know. I guess that part was kept confidential,\" Albie said. \"For the boy's protection I guess.\" \n\n\"Poor baby,\" Jessica frowned. \n\n\"So,\" Harlen said. \"Are you guys up for it?\" \n\n                                     ¤ ¤ ¤\n\nWe all crawled into Harlen's truck around 6pm and headed to the Lockwood house. Albie took his video recorder and held it in front of his face. \"Hey, what's up guys, gals, and nonbinary folks!\" Albie spoke with conviction as he stared wide-eyed in the video recorder. \"We're going to prove that ghosts are real!\" \n\nI rolled down the window and glanced out at the scenery. I laughed to myself when we passed a large cornfield. \"Guys, this seriously looks like we're going straight into a modern day horror film.\" \n\n\"It really does,\" Jessica agreed. \n\n\"I can already feel this place, I'm beginning to sweat all over.\" Albie exclaimed as he turned his camera to the window then back on himself. \n\n\"Like something about this place isn't right at all? That's pretty understandable, considering.\" Harlen said, turning down a gravel road.\n\n\"We're gonna recieve a ton of views for this!\" Albie smiled. He turned the camera toward Harlen who waved back from the review mirror.\n\n\"Dude,\" Harlen chuckled. \"I bet some of these viewers are going to think you're crazy because you're willing to allow something to throw you across the room and-possibly-murder you for content.\" \n\nWe pulled up to the gate in front of the two - story colonial home. There was already a green van parked outside the gate to the property. Mark greeted us at the gate with a colorful bottle of vodka. Mark was an average looking guy in his early 20s with shaggy brown hair and brown eyes. He raised the bottle in his right hand with shot glasses in the other. \n\n\"Hey, guys,\" Mark handed each of us a shot glass. \"Did you get here alright?\" \n\n\"Oh yeah. I've driven passed this place a couple of times, I didn't even need the GPS\" Harlen said.\n\n\"This definitely screams illegal.\" I commented, pointedly toward the large house.\n\n\"Only if we get caught, but this place is abandoned so I doubt we'll get into any trouble with the law.\" Harlen said.\n\n\"I'm giving you alcohol, and you're more worried about \"breaking and entering\"? Mark laughed. \n\nAlbie took his shot and made a face. \"This tastes like Tucan Sam fucked me.\" \n\n\"Ew,\" Jessica grimaced.\n\nHarlen and I laughed. Mark only snorted.\n\nAfter we each had several shots of vodka, we got ready. We each grabbed a headlight in order to keep our hands free, gloves, and disposable face masks and placed them into our backpacks, along with first aid (just in case). Mark had been urbexing for a while, and he was always prepared with supplies just in case anyone forgot to bring something. \n\n\"So, what happens if we're not alone in the house?\" Jessica asked.\n\nEven though urbex sites are technically \"abandoned\" that didn't mean you wouldn't run into other people inside like squatters or addicts, and they may not react well to seeing a stranger in their space.\n\n\"It's a good thing I brought this along,\" Mark said. He pushed his jacket aside and revealed a hand gun tucked inside its holster. \n\n\"Holy crap, man.\" Harlen said. \n\n\"I can't believe you brought a gun.\" Albie said.\n\nJessica and I were speechless. It's a good idea to bring some sort of self defense tool just in case your physical safety is threatened, but bringing something like a gun raises the risk of you accidentally injuring yourself. \n\n\"Of course I did. It's always good to carry protection.\" Mark explained.\n\nA few minutes after, the five of us walked up to the large rusted gate. With a little bit of work, we each slipped through the bars and headed up to the house. \n\n\"You know those haunted attractions where people dress up in order to scare the shit out of you, except it's actual demons and they're going to steal your soul!\" Jessica smiled beside Albie who threaded his fingers through hers. \"It's actually kinda thrilling.\"\n\n\"Awesome,\" Harlen smirked. \"I'm glad you sound so optimistic about it.\" \n\n\"I try to be!\" \n\nWe stepped up onto the porch, which wrapped around the front of the house. The paint on the door was chipped with age in places. \"Are you guys ready?\" Harlen asked. \"Once we enter this house, we will possibly become vulnerable to any demonic presence that might reside here.\" \n\nI rolled my eyes. \"If I'm in serious danger, I'm getting out. I'll throw myself out the window if I have to.\" \n\n\"I'm on Kaya's team,\" Jessica agreed. \"Team rational.\"\n\n\"What, and risk getting a broken leg?\" Albie asked.\n\n\"Better a broken leg than having your soul taken by a demonic entity.\" I replied.\n\n\"Alright, guys let's do this.\" Harlen said. He opened the door and the five of us headed inside. \n\nThe front door opened up into a foyer. Straight ahead of us was a staircase that led up to the second floor. There was a spacious living room to our right and a dining room to our left, and from there, an alcove enterance that led into the kitchen. I could tell that this place had been abandoned for years; there was cobwebs and peeled paint on the walls. There were remnants of furniture left ripped, dismantled, and stained which laid disorderly on the floor of the living room, reminding me of death. \n\nThis had once been the home of a happy upper-class family, full of life. Now it was replaced by ghosts of the past, vermin, spiders, dirt, and trash. The smell of rot and the taste of regurgitated food made me grimace in disgust. \n\n\"Why hasn't anyone fix this place up and put it back on the market?\" Jessica asked.\n\n\"Who really knows,\" Albie replied.\n\n\"Hello!\" Harlen announced as he twirled on his heels. \"Are there any spirits here?\" I glanced over at Harlen with a look and he shrugged. \n\n\"Is this what you guys imagined?\" Mark queried. \n\n\"Sure, minus the dead bodies,\" I walked into the living room and spotted a mid century record player console propped up against the wall next to a grand piano. There was a record still on the turntable, \"You Belong To Me\" by \"Patience and Prudence\"\n\n\"Hey, come check this out.\" Out of curiosity I placed the stylus and tried turning it on, not really expecting anything to happen. I jerked my hand away when it began to play. \n\nI quickly took the needle off, a little creeped out. \"Holy crap, that scared me.\"\n\n\"That thing still works?\" Albie asked, as he inspected the record player. \"That song is kinda sweet,\"\n\n\"No it isn't,\" Jessica frowned. \"It's the kind of song you would hear while being tortured to death.\" \n\nAfter we goofed around a little bit, we all decided to begin exploring around the house. Mark started up the stairs and asked if anyone would like to join him. \n\n\"I'll join you, man.\" Harlen said. He gave me a wink before heading towards the stairs with Mark, and I glanced over at Albie and Jessica as they disappeared down the hall.\n\nI was alone.\n\nI walked over to the piano, and carefully lifted the lid up and over to reveal its keys. My fingers traced the lines in between them and pushed down lightly on a few. The deep sounds reverberated around the room. \n\nMy eyes drifted up to the small picture frame sitting on top of the piano. I absent-mindedly bit my bottom lip and reached up to grab the frame. My fingers trailed across the picture, leaving an oily impression against the glass that held the picture in place. A family of four stared back at me and I realized that it was Ethan, Anna, and their twin boys. I was so focused on the twins that I almost didn't hear my phone alerting me that I had a new text message.\n\nIt was a text from Albie.\n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 6:45pm: Meet us down in the basement. I want to show u something.\n\nTo \"Albie\" at 6:46pm: What is it?\n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 6:46pm: There's some cool shit down here. Hurry up.\n\nI rolled my eyes and placed my phone in my pocket as I made my way down the hall. I paused at the top of the basement stairs. I could hear Jessica and Albie, the beems from their headlights bouncing around. \n\n\"Albie?\" I called out. \n\n\"Yeah, Kaya, we're down here.\" He replied. \"Come on down. We have something to show you.\" \n\n\"Alright, I'm coming down hold on.\" I carefully descended the stairs and turned the corner. \"So, what did you want to show me-\" \n\nMy voice died in my throat. It was dark down here, and my friends were nowhere to be seen. I was gripped by a sudden sense of unnease. I stood near the stairs and turned on my headlamp. \"Hello? Albie, this isn't funny, dude.\" \n\nWhat answered me was silence. Absolute silence. I was alone, or I thought I was until my light fell onto something moving a few feet in front of me. It was an androgynous looking kid around my age with pale skin, shoulder-length black hair, and violet eyes. They wore a long sleeve gothic cloak poncho, over thin black leggings. Their lips pulled back into a malicious grin as they came closer to me. I watched in horror as their eyes rolled to the back of their head and their mouth split open wide, revealing sharp teeth. \n\nThey reached out for me and I screamed in terror, my instincs finally kicked in. I bolted up the steps, and stumbled into the hallway. I ran for the front door and tried to leave, but it wouldn't open. *What the hell?!* that made no damn sense! My heart sank into the pit of my stomach. Suddenly I felt something touch my shoulder. I screamed, ready to defend myself.\n\n\"Hey. Hey! Kaya, stop it's me, Albie.\" \n\nI stopped struggling as my eyes refocused on the familiar faces in front of me. Albie, Jessica, and Harlen stared back at me with confused alarm. \n\n\"Are you alright?\" Harlen asked. \"What happened?\"\n\nI shook my head and quickly glanced behind them at the basement door, but there was nothing there. I know I hadn't imagined it! I turned my attention back to my friends. \"I saw something down in the basement! I want to leave. Now.\" \n\n\"What are you talking about, Kaya? Hold up, did you see something down there? Holy shit. The ghosts didn't think one of us would see them, but we did. Can you-\"\n\nBefore Albie can finish his sentence, I roughly pushed him away from me and turned back to the door. \"Damnit, Albie! I don't want to be in this fucking house anymore! It won't open! Why won't it open!\" \n\n\"Seriously, Kaya what the hell?\" Albie asked, almost annoyed.\n\n\"Just relax, Kaya. Let me give it a try, alright?\" Harlen offered, calmly. He grabbed the knob, but it stayed shut. \"What the hell?\"\n\n\"See? I told you it won't open!\" I hissed.\n\n\"What do you mean, \"it won't open\" let me give it a try.\" Albie shoved his way passed us. He motioned for all of us to stand back and we watched as he tried to use his whole body against it.\n\n\"M-maybe the door's jammed.\" Jessica exclaimed. \"Let's chill out. The front door isn't the only exit out of this place.\" \n\n\"Jessica's right. Let's try the door in the kitchen.\" Harlen said. We entered the kitchen and Harlen quickly made his way over to the screen door that faced the forest. He cursed under his breath. \"Damnit. Nothing.\" \n\n\"Hold up, guys. Where's Mark?\" Albie asked.\n\nHarlen quickly pulled his phone out to call Mark when we all collectively got a text from him. Reminding us that we had set up a group chat for easy contact. Harlen glanced back at me with an odd expression I couldn't name. I opened my texts and a sharp stab of dread settled in my stomach. \n\nFrom \"Mark\" at 7:05pm: I'm down in the basement, Harlen. Where r u? \n\nFrom \"Mark\" at 7:06pm: Harlen is that u? It's not funny, man.\n\nHarlen texted Mark that we were all in the kitchen. I watched as the three small dots in a text bubble pending before it disappeared and Harlen's cell phone rang. He answered and placed Mark on speaker phone. \n\n\"What the hell do you mean you're in the kitchen? I definitely heard your voice down here.\" \n\nHarlen cursed, and told Mark to make his way to the kitchen. Harlen started toward the basement and we all followed right behind him. Before we could reach the stairs to the basement, however, the door swung shut, the force of it knocked us backwards. We heard Mark's gun go off several times followed by his peircing screams of terror before they were abruptly cut short. In our inebriated panic, I failed at the last second to realize we were all running in different directions. \n\nI remember running up the stairs and locking the bathroom door behind me. My heart pounded painfully against my ribcage as I fumbled for my phone, thankful that it hadn't fallen out of my pocket. I willed myself to control my sobs and called 911, but for some reason my call wouldn't go through. \n\n\"Nononono! Fuck, please no.\" I collapsed against the bathtub and cried into my sleeves. Paranoia nearly consumed me once I thought of my friends and every horrible scenario when I received a text from Albie. I looked at it confused. \n\nI wiped the snot from my face and quickly texted him back. How in the hell was I able to receive his texts when I couldn't get ahold of the cops? \n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 7:20pm: Apparently we can contact each other in this house, but our phone's service seems to be cut off from the outside world. Where r u?\n\nWhat the hell is going on in this place??\n\nTo \"Albie\" at 7:21pm: I'm in the upstairs bathroom. Do u know where Harlen and Jess are? \n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 7:25pm: Jess is with me. I don't know where Harlen is. \n\nMy stomach dropped, but before I could reply Albie sent another text, and what I read made my blood run cold.\n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 7:25pm: There is smthing moving in the hallway outside the room we r in. Stay quiet and keep ur phone on silent. If we need to contact each other use text.\n\nIt was around thirty minutes after when Albie replied with another text updating me with their situation. The thing stalking outside their room a while ago was gone now, and it hadn't come back.\n\nFrom \"Albie\" at 8:00pm: We're going to make our way to you. Stay where u r\n\nTo \"Albie\" at 8:02pm: Ok. Be careful. \n\nI slowly got to my feet and set my phone down beside the sink and took a deep breath to level my breathing. Suddenly, I heard something pound against the door. I screamed and stumbled backward. \"Holy shit!\"\n\n\"Kaya?\" It was Harlen. \"Kaya, is that you?\"\n\n\"H-Harlen?\" I collected myself and made my way over to the bathroom door. I walked into the hallway, relieved that I wasn't alone anymore. Harlen was safe, thank God. \"Oh my god, Harlen I'm so glad you're-\"\n\nI gasped, and I stumbled forward as the door behind me slammed shut. I felt a sudden wave of dread wash over me as my eyes swept up and down the vacant hallway. Whatever was keeping us here tricked me. I quickly tried going back into the bathroom, but it wouldn't open, not only that but I left my phone by the sink. \"No! Damnit!\" I needed my phone, it was my only way to stay in contact with my friends, and how was Albie going to know where I was? I had two options, I could try and make my way to Albie or find another place to hide. \n\nMy heart thudded loudly in my ears as my headlamp bounced off the walls, chasing nothing more than shadows. I stuck close to the wall as I made my way down the hall. From somewhere down the hall, I heard a voice call out. It was Albie's voice telling me to come over to him. I hesitated for a moment. What if it was another trick? It definitely could be since whatever is toying with us was capable of mimicking voices. What if it really was Albie? Regardless, I had to go passed the room if I wanted to find Albie or another place to hide.\n\n\"Kaya, we're in here,\" Albie whispered to me as I got closer to one of the bedrooms. I hesitated before I stepped inside. The bedroom smelled awful, like rotten meat hung out in the sun for too long. My headlamp's light swept the room until it landed on a lone figure lying face-up on the bed. \n\n\"...Albie?\" I whispered, tentatively. My voice sounded thin, like old paper. The figure on the bed didn't answer, but when I I crept closer, I slipped on something wet. I glanced down at the floor. It was blood; a trail of blood led in from the doorway all the way to the bed. \"Oh my god!\" I screamed. My stomach rebelled and I heaved out my lunch until I couldn't expel anything else. \n\nMy throat burned as I wiped my mouth, and my chest hurt from sobbing out his name. Mark laid sprawled on the bed, his abdomen was ripped open and what remained of his entrails spilled over his body like a gory blanket. I stumbled backward, I fell against the door closing it shut. I was about to leave when I spotted the gun tucked under Mark's jacket. \n\nOh god, this was probably the worst decision ever and the likelihood that this was yet another trick was high, but I needed something to protect myself with. I've watched Mark use it before when we all went camping a year ago, so I kind of knew how to use it. I steeled myself and started toward the bed. \n\nThe closer I got the more I can see the damage done to his body; his abdomen and chest cavity were open and hollowed out. The skin looked like it was rolled back, torn and ragged. His sternum was completely gone, a few of his ribs were cracked so they protruded from either side of his body like fangs. Half of his bottom lip looked like it was chewed off and his left ear was missing. I shook my head and tentatively reached out for the gun. Just as I grabbed it, I felt something gooey covered on the grip of the gun. \n\nI yelped and dropped it on the floor. I cursed and bent down to pick it up. Once I did I wiped the substance off with my sleeve with a grimace and made sure the safety was on. I was tucking it into my jacket pocket when something dripped onto my hand. I looked up and saw Mark or what used to be Mark looming over me from the ceiling like Spiderman. His eyes were oily black, his face twisted in an agonized and vengeful expression. Before I could move, he threw himself at me.\n\nSomehow, I managed to dodge him and wrench the door open, hitting Mark as he lunged at me. The blow was hard enough that it sent Mark sprawling across the floor. I rushed out of the room and back into the empty hallway. I took a chance and looked back, but Mark wasn't there. \n\nWhen I reached the end of the hallway, I felt hands grab me and pull me around the corner. I opened my mouth to scream, but a hand clamped over my mouth, silencing me. Panic cut through my body like a hot blade, and new found adrenaline flooded my system as I twisted and shoved at the person holding me immobile.\n\n\"Kaya, stop,\" Albie hissed. \"It's me.\"\n\nI turned around and my eyes widened with tears as Albie released his hand from my mouth, and Jessica pulled me into a hug as I told them what happened. Albie pointed towards the stairs and motioned for us to follow. Albie led us into the foyer. We heard movement in the basement so as quickly and quietly as we could, we crawled inside a closet across from the living room.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" Jessica asked. \"We have no weapons!\"\n\n\"I found this on Mark's body.\" I exclaimed as I showed them the hand gun. \n\nAlbie got to his feet. \"ah, crap...I'm going to be right back. I left my camera in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"What? Hell no.\" I hissed. Splitting up is a terrible Idea! Risking his life for that damn camera? Was he an idiot? \n\n\"Just stay here, alright? Kaya, keep that gun out.\" He said, with no room for an argument. \"Whatever this thing is, it can mimic our voices so we'll need a password to distinguish them from us.\" He took out his phone and typed *Last Alliance* \n\nAfter he left, I crawled over to the door and locked it. I sat down next to Jessica who was sobbing. I turned to her and placed my palms to her tear stained face. \"Hey, Jess. We'll make it out of here alright? I promise-\" \n\nJessica shook her head and pushed my hands away from her face. \"Don't say that shit to me. We're going to die here, Kaya!\" She hissed. \"Why is this happening? I wanna go home!\" \n\nI sat back against the wall and sighed. \n\nTen minutes later I heard movement coming from outside the room. I quickly got to my feet and placed my hands on the door. \n\n\"Last Alliance,\" Albie whispered, rather quickly. \"Hurry up and let me in.\"\n\nI hadn't even released the door knob when Albie pushed passed me and helped Jessica to her feet without much protest on her end. \"Shit, it was him all along.\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked.\n\n\"I caught it on camera!\" He whispered frantically. \"The reason he brought us out here wasn't to-shit-\" he was breathing hard. He moved toward me and shoved the camera in my direction. \"Here, hold onto it for-\" His sentence was cut off abruptly as the thing that used to be Mark drilled his fist into Albie's chest from behind. Albie's eyes widened as his mind had come to the realization at what happened. \n\nMark dropped Albie's body on the ground and his lips twisted into a manic grin as he examined his blood-covered arm. \"He was spying on us,\" Mark said, but it didn't sound like Mark anymore. His voice sounded like several voices overlapping, fighting for center stage. \"He didn't think that we would notice, but we did.\" \n\nWe screamed, and holding onto the camera with one hand I pulled her toward me with the other, quickly. We couldn't save him, and I knew that if we didn't move now we would end up just like him.\n\nJessica and I bolted down the hallway and back up the stairs. We found an empty room that must have been a personal office at one point, and barricaded ourselves inside. I cursed when I noticed the room we were in didn't have a window wide enough for us to escape through. I sat against the wall beside Jessica who sobbed into her sleeves.\n\nI glanced down at the camcorder which felt heavy in my hand. What did Albie capture on camera that had him so upset? I turned it on and what I saw on the screen made my blood run cold. It was Harlen, the kid from the basement who stood beside Harlen, and the thing that used to be Mark; Harlen was speaking to him, but it was in a strange language that I couldn't understand. After he was finished, the thing that used to be Mark knelt down as if Harlen was some kind of royalty, and that was where the video stopped. \n\nI heard that thing right outside the room we were in. He was telling us that no matter what we did, we were not leaving this place. A few seconds later, he broke through the door, pushing the desk and chairs out of the way with ease. With the force, one of the chairs knocked me to the floor. \n\nHe released a sick and twisted laughter, and stalked toward me, eyes filled with malice. Jessica grabbed something heavy from the floor and chucked it at Mark. Mark was startled for a second, and then slowly turned his attention to her. She yelped and frantically swept her eyes around the room for anything she could use as a weapon. He lunged for her and they collided to the floor. \n\nI fumbled for my jacket's zipper for the gun, but I was too late. I watched in utter horror as he ripped into my friend; her screams of terror and agony will haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life. I pulled myself to my feet, my back bumped into something hard. A metal filing cabinet. Mark turned his attention back on me, but before he could reach me, he tripped over something and he fell to the floor. I shifted, and using my whole body weight, I managed to tip it over. It landed on top of Mark with a sickening crunch of bone and viscera. \n\nI slowly made my way to Jessica's body and collapsed to my knees. I clutched at my own head and screamed until it hurt. At that moment, all I wanted to do was crumble in defeat. My voice had broken into heavy sobs so loud and ugly that I almost didn't hear Harlen's footsteps behind me. \n\n\"Kaya, is that you?\" He called out to me, his voice full of worry. I was hardly listening to him. This was his fault! Rage spiked through me like a knife to my gut, it twisted and turned until I was all ground beef inside; I had the sudden urge to pull the gun from my jacket and-no, I had to calm down. Maybe if I feigned ignorance, I might still have a chance to escape, however slim that was. He bent down, and I let him pull me along with him without protest. With his eyes forward, I slowly put my hand on the gun.\n\nWe were almost to the kitchen when Harlen turned around, and leaned against the wall. \"So, you know, don't you.\"\n\nIt wasn't a question. I slowly pulled out the gun, unlocked it, and trained it on him. He stared at me with an unsettling expression, and I could have sworn his eyes were black. I suddenly felt an intense pressure pour down on me. I could feel a miasma of something intense as his eyes bore into mine; my arms trembled with the effort of keeping them aloft. The gun clenched tightly in my hands like a life line. I couldn't faulter. I knew that if I did, even for an instant, Harlen would undoubtedly kill me.\n\n\"Oh, don't be like that, Kaya. You're not getting out of this house unless I say so, so let's just chat, hm?\"\n\nI shook my head and raised the gun to his chest, and for a brief moment I caught a glimpse of a surprised expression on his face when I pulled the trigger. The sound of the gunshot reverberated around me. I pulled the trigger again and again, but the gun was empty. I dropped it to the floor, my hands shaking. He glanced down at himself. \"Huh. Well, would ya look at that, you managed to get me through the ribs, good job.\"\n\nI was running before Harlen finished his sentence. However, he wasn't coming after me-at least not yet. Figures. I couldn't leave this place so he had no reason to put much effort into the chase. I stumbled through the house, catching myself on overturned furniture in order to keep my balance as I made my way towards the stairs.\n\nI tripped over something and I caught myself against the wall across from the stairs. I paused for a moment to catch my breath. The house seemed to resonate with his manic laughter. I glanced behind me, and I felt a wave of cold dread as he sauntered toward me down the hall. Hands in his pockets, with an almost amused expression. \n\n\"Where do you think you're going, Kaya?\" He asked. \"Didn't I tell you before?\"\n\nThe words, \"There is no escape\" suddenly appeared all over the walls in blood. I cursed, and pushed myself off the wall and bolted up the steps, down the hall, and into one of the bedrooms and quickly closed the door. I looked around at what was once a child's room. There was a twin sized bed in the center of the room, a nightstand across from the closet, and a bathroom.\n\nI spotted a decent sized window and I ran over to it, but it wouldn't open and I cursed when there was nothing around me to break it with. Without any time to come up with a plan, I quickly slid underneath the bed and turned off my headlamp. I immediately cursed at myself again, of all the places to hide I chose the first place any one would look! \n\nI contemplated whether or not to find another hiding place, but before I could move I heard him make his way down the hall singing that creepy ass song. \"My honey I know with the dawn that you will be gone, but tonight you belong to me, just little 'ol me~\" \n\nThe bedroom door opened. I covered my mouth and tried to silence my breathing, hoping to God that he wouldn't find me under the bed. I watched in fear as he closed the door behind him and made his way over to the bed. The bed dipped slightly as Harlen's weight sank onto it. He told me things I didn't want to hear and more. This monster-this demon-slithered into our lives just for all of this to happen. \n\nMy eyes widened and I tucked my arms to my sides, the wooden bed frame gave a protest above me as Harlen laid down on top of it. Then he sighed, almost forlorn. \"This was my brother's room, you know. Coming back here brings back so many memories,\" \n\nRight after he said that I felt something prickle behind my eyelids. I shut my eyes tightly as gruesome scenes appeared inside my head. There was so much blood, and images shown of a young boy in pajamas stalking through the house with an ax in his hands picking off his family members one by one-doing things a normal child his size wouldn't be able to do, but Harlen was anything but normal. I felt bile rise in my throat but I managed to keep it down. \n\n\"The final stage of grief is acceptance, Kaya.\" He said. His cruel voice brought me back to the present. \"You have a lot of spirit, I like that. I'm also in a good mood so I'll give you two options: you can either die here or you can become an important piece in my domino set. You should be grateful that I'm even giving you an option. So, what's it going to be?\"\n\nI opened my mouth and closed it again; what was I supposed to say to something like that? What was going to happen to me if I said yes? If I said no... \n\nA low growl -yes, a growl- rumbled above me and I felt something snag my ankle. I panicked, my fingers tore into the wooden floor as I was dragged out from underneath the bed. I was thrown across the room, pain shot up my back as something bit into my spine. Harlen straightened up and started toward me. I quickly averted my gaze, the panic swarmed all over me like a hive of angry bees. \n\n\"Wh-why are you d-doing this?\" I asked, my breath hitched between sobs. \n\nHarlen knelt down in front of me. \"Hey...hey look at me, Kaya.\" \n\nAbsolute terror gripped me as he forced me to look at him. His features weren't human; the light of the moon highlighted the inhuman planes of his face. Black, spidery thread-like lines creeped around his forehead and right beneath his oily black eyes. His mouth had split open, wider than any human mouth was capable of. \n\nHis nails grew long and sharp against my chin. It was mesmerizing, fascinating almost, like watching a lion's face before it tears yours off. Suddenly, I couldn't breathe; my lungs felt swollen and inflamed, my hands came up to my throat as I coughed and wheezed. Was this an asthma attack? No, it was Harlen. \n\n\"When I ask you a question, do not answer it with another question do you understand?\" He snarled. \"You will understand why when you arrive. Now, will it be a yes or a no?\"\n\nHis features calmed and he looked human again, and whatever power on me broke, it allowed me to inhale sharply. I gasped. I wanted to scream at him, I wanted to rage. Instead, I dropped my hands on my thighs. I wanted to live. \n\n                                        ¤ ¤ ¤    \n\n\"Kaya, honey\" My mom said, as she came into my hospital room, \"You've got someone to see you this morning! One of your friends from school, I think.\"\n\nI placed my book down on the table beside me. She bent down and gave me a kiss on the forehead. \"And he's very attractive,\" She whispered, \"It's not every day a tall handsome boy comes to sit by your bedside.\"\n\nI nodded and gave her a small smile. It drooped just a little when Harlen came around the corner with a bouquet of flowers. My mom smiled at him and walked toward the door, \"I'll just leave you two alone. What did you say your name was again?\"\n\n\"My name is Harlen,\" He said, as he stepped forward. \"Harlen Lockwood.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Harlen,\" She said, smiling back at him before exiting the room. \n\nHarlen placed the flowers on the table and sat down next to the hospital bed, he placed a hand on my thigh. \"I'm so glad you're feeling better, Kaya.\" He said. He gently pushed a loose strand of my hair out of my face and gently tucked it behind my ear. \"Remember what we talked about. You will come to me after you are discharged from the hospital,\"\n\nI shivered at his touch, and out of curiosity I asked, \"What happens if I don't?\" \n\nHarlen let loose a dark chuckle. His head dips until his lips skate by the curve of my ear. \"Then I'll hunt you down.\" He whispered to me like it's obvious. \"I'll kill you and everyone you care about. I'm capable of all sorts of horrors; things you can't even imagine.\" \nI watched as Harlen stood up from the seat.\n\n\"Now, I've got a few things to do before you arrive,\" Harlen said, smiling down at me. He paused by the room's door. \"I'll see you soon.\"\n\nHis visit was a few days ago. I'll be discharged tomorrow afternoon. I've made up my mind; all of those lives are dependent on me. Everything that happened that night was real. I know that most people won't believe me, but to be quite honest I don't care anymore. I'm going to leave my laptop here. \n\nMom, if you find this I'm so sorry. I love you so much. Goodbye. ",

        "text": "  \n\nIt was the summer of 1970. My older brother’s blue 1970 Dodge Challenger sat in the driveway. Dust had well begun to settle upon the seats and float around the car, permeating its interior. I remember when the letter arrived just a few weeks ago. My brother had died, over 8,000 miles from his home. He was tasked with being a rifleman. His body hadn’t been recovered. One can reasonably imagine what had befallen him. \n\nI was glad he was dead. I remember when he had forced me to watch him rape his girlfriend. He was 18, and she 16. He guilted her into it by saying that if she were to let him die a virgin, God would look unkindly upon her when it was too her turn to face him. Not to mention, it would be unpatriotic, according to him, for her to abstain from his sexual whims. \n\nHe said I should watch because I needed to see what a man looked like performing his ultimate purpose for God with a woman. She was a bit taller than him and blonde. Unfortunately for her, she had developed early, and my brother had noticed back when they both went to high school together. I watched her struggle against him, pleading and saying that it was unholy to do this before marriage. They looked awkward; her body squirming and struggling against the weight of his until it just stopped and surrendered, lying motionless as he thrust against it. He took away her humanity, her soul, and now the world had taken his.\n\nMy brother’s name was Joseph, but it didn’t matter now. Now he was just a corpse in the ground. Now he was just a war story. \n\nMy mother wept insufferably loud at the funeral. I stood next to her in my little black suit and tie, tailored perfectly and freshly dry-cleaned. My father had ensured it be presentable. I attempted to coax myself into crying. I tried, I really did, but nothing would come. I just stood with a thousand-yard stare as my face grew red while I struggled. My mother had later that day called me brave for not shedding a tear. She said I was strong, just like my brother. She was just attempting to fill the empty void with empty words, per usual. I pitied her until I didn’t. At the end of the day, it was her fault for even letting my brother go. \n\nHe had a doctor who was willing to write him off as ineligible for the draft if you will. But he wanted to prove to our father that he was strong, and spite him at the same time. My mother had protested him shipping off, of course, but not for very long. His misguided enthusiasm knew no bounds, and my mother would eventually resign herself to her upstairs study, staring blankly at the 19-inch colorless television in its corner. She was a pushover, and that’s why my father loved her so much. \n\nMy father. I remember after my older brother’s funeral he forced me to read the bible with him. Some chapter in Revelation, I think it was. My finger guided me across the page, shaking as it moved from line to line. “Why don’t you read faster, retard,” he vainly inquired in an unnecessarily loud fashion. I tried, I really did, but I couldn’t manage to. Tears began to swell out from my eyes, and drop down onto the page, like little airborne paratroopers to the battlefield. \n\nMy mouth ran dry as a desert, and the tears clouded my vision. I couldn’t see the page anymore. My father continued to yell at me. “You’re crying because the devil is in you,” he insisted. “I’m just trying to free you of it.” He grabbed the heavy bible off my lap and used it to whack me against the head, then paused for a moment, breathing heavily from his nostrils. He held the bible in his shoulder and leaned in close to my ear. “You know, your brother never had much intelligence, but at least he had the moxie to die like a man, with honor. At least he was worth something.” He walked proudly out of my room, and into the hallway. I watched him walk away while I cowered on the floor, my left ear ringing loudly. I laid there and hoped he’d move on to my mother or something, and spare me the bruises, the dread, and the nose ornamented with dark red blood. \n\nMy father had a master’s degree but didn’t seem to make much use of it. He taught at the nearby middle school; the same one I had the misfortune of attending. On the outside, he seemed well-liked, and a respectable member of the community. He attended church every Sunday morning, devoting more time to Christ than most folks would be privy to. He taught English, a subject for which he had a great passion for. The only thing he liked more than Christ, perhaps, was appearing highly educated, and his well-versed knowledge of the English language afforded him the ability to present himself as an academic. \n\nHe never let himself get too close to people, however. He must have been too afraid. If they got too close, they’d probably start asking questions. Maybe ask him why I came to school with bruises. After the first time he left bruises on me, I came to school in a short sleeve shirt, but my father has refined his strategy since then. He limits the beating, avoids bruising, and when bruising does occur, he ensures my outfit for school the next day includes a long sleeve shirt, a jacket, or something to cover me up and hide away what was there. Most nights, he came home, drank, graded papers while attempting to simultaneously watch Jeopardy, drank more, and then proceeded to pass out on the couch. Surprisingly, he’d get most of the questions and categories right. He and my mother never slept together anymore. Maybe he looked too much like my dead brother. \n\nI sat outside on the front porch, staring at my brother’s car. Its exterior glistened in the afternoon sun. It still seemed like any minute he could walk back up to the house, with his ruck on in his army combat uniform, a smile on his face. I remember, before he shipped off; before he made me watch him forcibly posit himself upon his girlfriend, and before he was dead in a hole in Vietnam, he was the only one who could stand up to my dad. In a strange way, I did miss him. I miss when he called my dad out on his missteps, on his acts against God, and put him in his place. I miss when he drove me to school in his shiny car. But I was glad he was dead. He no longer had to suffer here, at least. He no longer had to be subjected to my intolerable, dull, enabler mother and my abusive, prideful father. As the sun’s afternoon light cascaded from the sky down to the car, I asked God if he would take me too. \n\nIt was now the Fall of 1975. My father had shown me mercy, which he did occasionally. He was letting me take my brother’s car to school. It had been sitting for a couple of years now. Every now and then, my mother would take it to run an errand and ensure the car still ran and wasn’t stationary for too long. Yesterday, I had been a typical junior, riding the bus to school and back home. Tomorrow, I’d insert a led zeppelin 8 track into the player and drive to school with the windows down. I had completed driver’s ed over the summer and was ready to drive on my own. \n\nDuring my bus-to-school era, I had been picked on by this bully named Jeremy. He was overweight and had a face only his mother and his girlfriend could love, but he was on the football team so naturally, his entire circle just went along with or at the least ignored his antics. He would call me “loser,” that was my only name on most bus rides home from school. I was a skinny, short kid with straggly brown hair, so bullying was written in the stars for me, but it had escalated this year, and I no longer held any patience for it. My mother would parrot, “The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him.” But sometimes God doesn’t listen, and a man must take matters into his own hands. \n\nOf course, I could never engage in fisticuffs with Jeremy. Man-on-man would be a surefire way to get myself seriously injured and forsake my name for the rest of my high school career. So, on this night before school, I hid a sock packed with a couple of rocks at the bottom of my green, army camo backpack. I even double-layered the sock, that is I encased the initial sock with another sock, in hopes that that would aid against the weapon potentially tearing open at any point. I also, the morning of, taped a pocketknife to the side of my boot and let the end of my pant leg naturally conceal it. \n\nAll I had to do was lure my tormentor into a low-visibility area, as far away from any prying eyes as possible. I had done it with animals before, but never one this large. I pulled into the student lot that morning with a freshness that had alluded me since before my brother’s passing. The sky seemed brighter than usual, the 8-track stereo sounded phenomenal, and I couldn’t stop smiling. I had secured a small baggie of pot from a kid who lived a few blocks away from me a couple of days prior. This would be my means of convincing Jeremy to follow me through the back doors of the school and into the woods a few hundred meters west of the campus. Jeremy, of course, was a stoner. \n\nI was barely able to stay in my seat throughout the day, due to sheer excitement and anticipation. After this, Jeremy would leave me alone, and I could stop telling myself my incessant praying would be anything but fruitless. Jeremy was stuck in study hall after most of the student body had left the school, as was per usual due to his inability to take anything seriously. He was one of those people who thought high school would go on forever, that he would be relevant and cool and catered to until the end of time. It’s like he didn’t know he was just some rich footballer kid. It’s like he didn’t know one day the world would indiscriminately relieve him of his mortal duties, like he’d be young and popular forever. \n\n“Hey, Jeremy,” I whispered whilst holding the study hall classroom door ajar and peeking my head into the room. Mr. Booker sat slumped over at his desk, likely in an alcohol-induced slumber, judging by the suspect silver thermos perched on his desk, that which he was clutching tightly upon despite his daze. “What the… “Jeremy exclaimed as he noticed my intrusion. I held out the little baggie of marijuana and shook it around, like a pet owner shaking a bag of treats to draw their pet to them. Jeremy’s eyebrows raised as his eyes lit up with a remarkable glow. “Follow me,” I spoke into the room in a quiet but direct voice. Jeremy sprung from the desk he had just been occupying, approached me with quickness, and launched me into the hallway with the extension of a singular arm. He huffed “what’ve you got there, loser.”\n\nI jammed the baggie into my jean pocket. “If you’ve got something we can smoke this with, I’m up for making amends,” I stated with a certain hesitance. I wanted to appear as unintimidating as possible. He could not know that I was planning something. He could not know I had a sock stuffed with rocks in my jacket pocket. Jeremy stared directly at me with intrigue, his eyes darting from my head to my toes. He was analyzing me. “Fine,” he uttered with a concluding huff. His eyes fell to each of the opposite ends of the hallway and back toward me. “Follow me,” I said and began to advance toward the rear double doors of the school. “let’s just make it quick,” he said briskly as we both range walked toward the back doors. “I have plans with Violet this evening, so don’t waste my time.” I nodded to acknowledge this as I held my arm out and opened one of the doors. \n\nWe walked a few hundred meters to the wood line. “You’re lucky I brought my bowl with me today,” said Jeremy as we stood next to the trees. A certain silence perfused the air surrounding us as the trees swayed lightly in the wind, adorned with a setting sun. Fear crawled up my spine and latched onto my forebrain. What if I am to fail? What if Jeremy gains the upper hand? I pushed these thoughts aside and motioned for Jeremy to follow me into the forest. Jeremy’s footsteps fell into cadence with mine, we were walking so long. It was like we were soldiers marching into south Vietnam, attempting to mentally prepare for the unknown that lie ahead of us. \n\n“Let’s hurry this up, man,” insisted Jeremy. His patience was beginning to wane, but I wanted to go just a bit further. We had to be 1000 meters or so deep already. We eventually approached a small stream, and I sat down, reaching into my jean pocket for the baggie. The sun was beginning to lower itself onto the horizon’s line now. I pulled out the baggie, and Jeremy snatched it from me whilst kneeling and holding out his pipe in his other hand. “I’m assuming your fairy ass probably doesn’t know how to pack this,” he insisted boldly while looking over at me with a smirk. He smirked at me as if we were close friends catching up over a beer. Who did he think he was? \n\nHe opened the baggie and held it to his nose as if to revel in the scent of the marijuana. His smirk quickly turned into a look of pure rage. “This… is definitely not weed,” he said with disgust as he pulled his face from the bag. He held the bag up to his eyes and made a decree that it must be oregano, or something similar. My stomach fell ten stories within me, and my heart started to pound quicker than ever before. I wanted to get him good and high, and instead, all I managed to do was anger him. That kid who sold it to me had made me into a fool. Even worse, I was stuck with a raging footballer in the middle of the woods. \n\nBefore I knew it, my face was shoved into the ground. “I admire the effort, but this is just pathetic.” Adrenaline began to fill my body. My breathing intensified as my face was shoved into the dirt and pushed around in it. I remembered how my father used to smack the side of my head with a bible. I remembered how my ears rang as he’d left my room. Jeremy had reacted to my fumbling faster than I could have ever accounted for. He got up as my head was still on the ground and kicked me in the abdomen, twice. I recoiled and assumed a fetal position. “Get up, loser,” he snarked as he grabbed my arm and then brought me to my feet. “How about, for once, you fight back? Like a real man,” he suggested with a tone of vigor. \n\nI realized that what stood before me was a kid who had most definitely been in fights before, not only that, but he likely celebrated fighting. He had made his name, after all, by smashing into other kids, running past them, and launching them into the ground. I backed up into a tree and gasped as my back collided with its stern bark. It’s as if it was pushing me back into the fight. I then realized, to my horror, that a few feet in front of me lie my rock-filled sock, on the ground, covered partly by the orange visage of a few fallen leaves. I scrambled to unsheathe the knife that I had taped to the side of my boot, which fortunately was exactly where I’d expected it to be. I brandished the blade and held it out in front of me. Jeremy paused for a moment in genuine surprise, but quickly gathered himself and charged at me. I waved the knife around like an unthinking drunkard before it was swiftly slapped from my hand and thrown into the ground. \n\nJeremy looked down at the knife for a moment. “I don’t need it,” he muttered coldly. It was as if killing me was beneath him. As if he saw it as some laborious chore like I was a basket of clean laundry he still had to pick up and put away. He grabbed me by the collar and flung me into the leaves on the ground. A symphony of orange and yellow leaves took flight from the forest floor as they were projected into the air around me. I struggled to get oxygen to my lungs, it felt like I couldn’t breathe. I forced myself to get back up and face the beast before me. I stumbled back into a fighting stance and noticed the rock-filled sock now directly below my feet. I picked it up and swung it with the most strength I could summon, and it made direct contact with the side of Jeremy’s head. I swung it once more, striking his torso. \n\nHe let out a guttural scream of pain. His eyes widened and blood spilled out from the side of his head as he staggered to distance himself from me. He clasped his wound with his hand and again charged straight for me. I stepped out of the way, letting him trip over himself and fall over into the dirt. My heart was pounding now. I could hardly breathe. I guess it makes sense. A few pounds of rock, concentrated in the end of a sock had made direct contact with his temple. \n\nHe rose from the leaves and brushed himself off with astonishing resilience, and gritted his teeth, growling at me like an ugly dog. “yo- you,” he stuttered, “you won’t get away with this shit, man. My dad owns the Walker Suites hotel in town, man. There’s no way…” he trailed off. He shook his head back and forth as if to cut himself off and re-establish his focus. I sprang into action, and my legs gave out from under me as I ran into him and knocked him down into the brook. Was it the lack of oxygen? Had I simply tripped? I couldn’t be entirely sure, but either way, I was now on top of Jeremy, as we both lie in the water. He clambered to knock me off him, but I held myself sturdily above him, digging my feet into the riverbed’s dirt and placing my hands around his neck. I squeezed tight as I watched Jeremy wriggle around, splashing me with dirty river water in the process. He gripped the fabric of my jacket to throw me, but alas. He was too weak and had lost too much blood now. It reminded me of how my brother’s girlfriend had struggled helplessly years before.\n\nI winced as I held my hands around his throat. His breath smelled like old lunch meat and his face strained into an unpleasant red and purple contortion. I punched him in his crooked nose. He spat his blood into my face, but I held my position. He attempted to scream-gurgle at me, and still I held my position. I was my brother in that moment, snuffing the life of a Viet-Kong in the jungle as bullets darted around him. I would bring this boy back into the nothingness from which he came. I would show him what his daddy’s money meant after it was all said and done. It meant nothing. Just like my mother’s empty biblical affirmations. Just like the generic slogan embroidered on the back of Jeremy’s team-issued jacket. Empty, just like me. \n\n*Who can stand before His indignation?*\n\n*And who can endure the fierceness of His anger?*\n\n*His fury is poured out like fire,*\n\n*And the rocks are thrown down by Him.*\n\n \n\n(END...)",

        "text": "I was a 30 year old woman and I had just lost my husband to a tragic accident. I was devastated and felt incredibly lonely in our empty home. I thought that getting a dog might help fill the void and provide some companionship.\n\nI did some research and eventually found the perfect pup - a sweet and playful golden retriever. I named her Bella and brought her home. At first, everything seemed normal. Bella was a joyful and loving dog, always eager to play and cuddle with me.\n\nHowever, after a few weeks, strange things started happening. Bella would often stare at me with a sad and mournful expression, as if she was trying to communicate something to me. She would also whine and pace around the house, as if she was agitated or distressed.\n\nOne night, I woke up to the sound of Bella barking and growling. I got out of bed and followed the noise to the living room, where I found Bella standing in front of a mirror, staring at her reflection with a fierce and menacing look in her eyes.\n\nI was startled and confused, but I tried to calm Bella down and bring her back to bed. As I turned to leave the room, I caught a glimpse of my own reflection in the mirror. And that's when I saw it - the face of my husband, looking back at me with a sad and mournful expression.\n\nI gasped and stumbled backwards, tripping over Bella and falling to the floor. I couldn't believe what I was seeing - was it really my husband, or was it just my imagination playing tricks on me? I was terrified and didn't know what to do.\n\nIn the end, I decided to get rid of Bella. I couldn't handle the strange and frightening events that seemed to be connected to her presence. I knew it wasn't fair to the dog, but I couldn't bear the thought of living with that constant reminder of my husband's death. I found a new home for Bella and tried to move on with my life, After I got rid of Bella, I thought things would return to normal. But I was wrong.\n\nOne night, I heard a loud crash and woke up to find that my bedroom window had been smashed. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I fumbled for my phone and called the police, but before they arrived, I saw something moving outside the window.\n\nIt was Bella - or at least, it looked like Bella. But she was twice as big as before, with glowing eyes and sharp teeth bared. She was growling and snarling, and she seemed to be staring right at me.\n\nI screamed and backed away from the window, but it was too late. Bella - or whatever it was - leaped through the broken window and charged at me. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move fast enough. I could hear the creature's hot breath on my neck as it chased me through the house.\n\nI don't know how I managed to escape, but somehow I made it out of the house and into my car. I locked the doors and started the engine, speeding away as fast as I could. I didn't stop until I reached the police station, where I collapsed in tears and told them my story.\n\nThey didn't believe me at first, but when they went back to my house, they found evidence that something had indeed broken the window and chased me. They never found the creature, and I never went back to that house again.\n\nI never learned the truth about what happened that night, but I knew one thing for certain - I never wanted to see Bella, or any other dog, again.",

        "text": "For context, my mother and father split and we moved. My sister and I stayed with our mother. Our house is on the same property as my mother's parents and it happens to be in the middle of the woods. It's not a huge farm but we have three fields in different areas and a barn, with a lot of forest.\n\nWe moved when I was around five. My sister would've been two or three. Up until I was around twelve years old, I had only ever been up to the fields. I didn't know what lays beyond the ridge.\n\nI was walking with my grandpa in the woods. It was normal for us to do that. We were walking in a new area and we were looking for maple trees. We came across this small stream and on the other side we're stairs. They were small brick stairs, maybe about four or five steps. I was super confused because the stairs looked new. They were clean. Now being a curious twelve year old girl, I wanted to go climb them. I just figured they were old stairs from a house that could've been there. I told my grandpa about the stairs and he got wide-eyed. All he said to me was, \"Don't touch them. Don't climb them.\" Weird, but I knew my grandpa probably knew what he was talking about. \n\nI forgot about the stairs until around two years after. Now, I had been comfortable with our woods. I can go out by myself and not be worried about a thing. I know where i'm at no matter where I am on the property. Nevertheless, the staircase area was foggy in my head. I never remembered where they were at. Until I found a stream. I decided I was going to follow the stream. So I'm running along the right side of the stream when I look up. Sure enough, the same staircase was off to my left. I wanted to take a closer look, my mistake, and jumped over the stream. I walked over to the stairs. A weird feeling came over me, like when you're being watched. I don't know why I was so fascinated with the stairs but it was like they were calling to me. \n\nI was about to touch the first step, when I remembered what my grandpa told me. I loved my grandpa and I never wanted to disobey him. Though the stairs were calling to me, I took off back towards home. \n\nWhen I got back, I found my mother crying on the front porch. I asked her what was wrong and she looked up at me  with wide eyes. She just got up and ran to hug me. Still confused, I asked her what was wrong again. She proceeded to tell me how I'm never to go out by myself again. I brought up how I wasn't gone for that long, an hour at most. She just looked at me like I had three heads. She said, \"An hour? Try an entire day. Pap went looking for you where you said you'd be, you weren't there.\" Okay, so I lost a day to explore? I was back at nightfall. \n\nI thought the whole situation was weird but I didn't want to push on the subject. Fast forward to another year. My pap and I were on a hike again. This time, we were back on that little stream. Yet, never once did I see the stairs. When I asked my pap about it, he just asked \"What stairs?\"\n\nTo this day, I've never seen the stairs again. \n\nContinuing with my property, there's an old cemetery above on a hill, maybe a mile or two away. I've never personally been up there but my mom and grandparents have. Apparently a family died on the property from a disease. The father buried his wife and his two, i think, kids. The father was the last to go. \n\nThere was a boy buried in the cemetery. I don't know wether or not he was apart of the family, but we call him the \"Little Drummer Boy.\" That's what he does. On summer nights with the window open, you'll hear drumming. It sounds like someone is drumming right outside. \n\nI remember waking up one night to open the window and I just heard this faint drumming. As I laid back on the couch, the drumming got closer. Almost as if it was right outside the window. As far as I know, he's harmless. However, I squeezed my eyes shut and waited until it went away. I still hear him every summer, but I never go to check it out. Ever.\n\nI still live here as of right now but in a month or so, i'll be moving. Also I've seen scarier stories on NoSleep but I felt like I should share mine.",

        "text": " I originally posted this story here around 2012 and it gained a lot of interest and responses from people who were genuinely intrigued about what happened. I ended up having to delete the post because people I know used this sub and I was worried they would know it was me. So now 10 years later I feel it’s time to post it again because I still think about it quite often. I hope that doesn't break any rules!  \n\n\nSo it was summer 2010, I just turned 18 years old, just finished school and while most of my friends were heading to university all over the country I was just working a full time job, I was having a tough time knowing my main friend group was going our separate ways combined with having just split from my first girlfriend which hit me hard. I wasn’t depressed but I needed to decide what I was going to do for the foreseeable future. I needed to get away alone, from my hometown (in Wales, UK) just for a few weeks to clear my head and try to get thing straight.  \n\n\nMy Dad is Portuguese from the island of Madeira, an archipelago off the coast of Portugal that is a well known holiday destination, albeit mostly for retirees. He has a house over there and I decided to get a cheap flight and stay there by myself for about 10 days just to get away. During the times I visited Madeira throughout my childhood I hated it, there’s was next to nothing to do as a kid I easily got bored, which is a stark contrast to how I feel about the place now as I literally want to move there. It really is an underrated gem if you ever get a chance to visit.  \n\n\nSo I headed out in July of 2010, happy to be able to get away by myself and clear my head. Looking back as a 30 year old the reasons I was stressed seem pretty ridiculous now. I packed my hiking stuff as I’d planned to get out into the mountains, it’s an awesome destination for mountain walking. I arrived at my Dads house and the weather for the first few days was pretty crap, torrential rain and strong winds meaning I couldn’t really do much outside meaning I spent most of my time drinking coffee and watching Mythbusters reruns on tv.  \n\n\nThe weather finally improved after about 3 days and I woke up to a glorious sunny day, no clouds in the sky, no wind, 30°C/86°F. The sea crystal blue and the green mountains with rolling clouds over the summits. Perfect day. I headed out after breakfast about 10am and decided to get a bus about 10 miles to a town called Curral das Freiras (Pen of the Nuns) an isolated settlement well within the mountainous interior of the island, it got its name from being a safe haven for a convent of nuns who were hiding from Arab raids on the island in the 15th century and until the 80s there was only one sketchy road into the town that was often described as one of the most dangerous in Europe, now there’s a modern tunnel into the town and it’s a popular spot with tourists and locals.  \n\n\nMy plan was to hike from the town up one of the many trails to the mountains above. I stopped for a quick espresso in town, the place was bustling with tourists in cafes and gift shops and I never would expected what happened to me later.  \n\n\nI finished my coffee and headed towards the trails, I had a steep walk up a single track road that left the town, a few houses dotted on either side that became fewer and fewer as the road climbed. I got around 300m/1000ft above the town and the views were already incredible, the clean air and sense of freedom were exactly the reason why I went there to get away. I kept walking and the asphalt road became a dirt track, a lot narrower and with a lot more tree cover, still walking I kept climbing up almost into the clouds, the temperature dropped and there was a lot of moisture in the air, I stopped to put on a jacket.  \n\n\nAs I was fumbling in my backpack for my jacket and a granola bar I noticed a small shed, or what used to be a garage. The outside walls were black almost as if there’d been fire damage and the roof was partially caved in. I didn’t think anything of it, a lot of small buildings were abandoned in the area but what caught my eye was an opening in the rock face behind the building. It was a small cave, but what intrigued me more was the bottom half of the opening had been bricked up, and I think the whole opening at one point was blocked up but the top section was open.  \n\n\nBeing a boy a heart I was curious as to what was inside, I headed over and the opening was big enough for me to climb in, I’m writing this now wondering why I even chose to do this. I got through and surprisingly it was quite big inside, I was able to stand upright and I’m 6ft. The smell was damp and there was a lot of running water on the rocks and the ground, and plenty of green slime on the walls. It was dark and I had to use my phone torch to see. As soon as I lit up the cave I could see the extent of its size it was about 3m/9ft wide and about 5m/15ft long.  \n\n\nI didn’t think much of it and I was about leave until I noticed at the back end of the cave was almost a doorway to the right, it was a little lower than my height but it almost looked like an entrance to a room. I for some reason decided to explore further, note Madeira is effectively crime free and there’s no dangerous predators so I had little doubt there’d be anything sinister ahead. I stepped forward around half the length of the cave towards the opening, this was then I noticed the damp smell ended and was replaced with a foul, rotting flesh odour. I stopped to think what it could have been but I carried on holding my nose. I got to the opening and ducked down to get through, it wasn’t hugely narrow but I had to get on my knees. I shone the light into the opening and it revealed a small square room within the cave, about the same size as a large lift/elevator. But what I saw next has stuck with me ever since.  \n\n\nThe smell was unbearable at this point and there was thousands of flies in the room, the noise of which was almost deafening. On the floor was about 6/7 dead sheep and goats in a circle, all of which had their eyes gouged out. There was blood everywhere. Some had limbs missing and some had kitchen knives stabbed into their necks and bodies. There was also two that been decapitated. Their heads placed on top of their bodies. I gasped and took a step back, doing so I moved my torch towards the walls and it showed they were covered with dead birds and more sheep heads nailed into the rock, blood running down the stone onto the floor.  \n\n\nI started panicking and quickly clambered out of the cave, repeating “fuck! fuck! fuck!” over and over out loud as I ran out. I squeezed through the opening and stumbled onto the road, I fell onto the dirt track on all fours and tried to catch my breath, I turned into a sitting position and I didn’t realise I’d cut my shin on a rock and blood was running down my leg into my sock. I stood up quickly and ran back down the hill into the town, this was genuinely the only time I’d felt legitimately scared at something wasn’t an immediate threat to me. I got back to the town, pretty shaken and luckily I didn’t have to wait long for the bus back to my dads place. This completely shook me for the rest of the day, I didn’t sleep that night.  \n\n\nI wanted to tell somebody, but I knew they would not believe me or think I was exaggerating. I had a week left in Madeira and to be completely honest I carried on as if nothing had happened, even heading out on other hikes albeit as far away from Curral das Freiras as I could. It was only until I got home that it started bothering me. It took a few months for me finally sleep normally again but I can say even now 12 years later I think about this at least once a week.  \n\n\nI’ve been back to Madeira many times and even to Curral das Freiras, at the time I said I’d never go back, but as I said at the beginning I now want to live in Madeira because of its natural beauty and way of life, a stark contrast to drawl of living in the UK. I’m glad this didn’t taint my view of a beautiful place but my memory of what happened is still as vivid as ever. Although I hope this doesn’t deter anyone from visiting Madeira, it really is a paradise.  \n\n\nPart of me wants to go back to that cave, I’ve got a morbid fascination with knowing if it’s still there and the other part of me doesn’t want to go anywhere near it.  \n\n\nIt’s weird how the human brain works.",

        "text": "I can’t tell you exactly what we had been doing that night, but I know that we ended up sitting around a bonfire at Ocean beach, huddled together, sharing blankets and passing a bottle of cheap Russian vodka between shivering hands. That period of my life is a blur of dark nights and big feelings – thirteen years old and tasting some kind of independence for the first time, I basked in my actualized preteen fantasies as if they were the heat from the dancing flames before my very eyes. As a younger sibling with an inferiority complex, I had always craved the romanticized, formless concept of “being older.” I did everything in my power to push impatiently past childhood until finally, in the eighth grade, some older friends invited me to go out with them on a Friday night. That night didn’t so much change my life as it presented me with the life that I always knew was waiting for me. Lying to parents, drinking liquor and smoking cigarettes, going to punk shows, casual hookups between friends, stick and poke tattoos, tagging, stealing, singing - no - screaming lyrics into the night, our words painting the stars on the black sky above as we laughed and cried and tripped over each other up and down the streets of the city that had become our playground. San Francisco in the early 2000s – no one will tell you that this wasn’t a special time and place, especially for kids whose parents weren’t paying attention. The nights meshed together into a singular experience that was *adolescence*, characterized more by a feeling than any singular event.\n\nSo when I say I can’t tell you exactly what we had been doing that night, understand that it’s because it was just like any other night. It was windy, there were five or six of us and we had ended up around a bonfire at Ocean Beach, our bare feet digging into the cold sand. \n\nIt was Anya who offered the dare. “I bet you won’t go skinny dipping,” she glared across the fire at Oscar. Oscar glared back as the flames cast dancing shadows over his sharp features. A slow smile spread across his face, and without a word he wriggled out of his jacket, pulled his hoodie and t-shirt over his head, dropped his pants and underwear and ran towards the water, dancing and twirling into the darkness.\n\nNow I feel like I have to pause and say that this wasn’t strange behavior. Oscar pretty much got naked at any opportunity and with no apparent regard for modesty or cold. I remember the first time he did it; we had snuck into the Lincoln Park Golf Course and after slipping away for a moment he streaked by us, prancing and yipping like he had just been let out of a laboratory and was touching grass for the first time. This was how Oscar lived – he attended School of the Arts with a concentration in dance, but he also played music, made paintings, and never hesitated to tell us all how much he loved us, how these were the days of our lives, just how *real* all of this was. He dubbed mixtapes for us from an old cassette player and wrote little songs about his friends. Oscar’s parents were Russian immigrants who were hard working and seemingly neglectful. It had been clear the couple of times that I visited his house that he had even less of a parental presence than the rest of us. Maybe this was why he was so tender with his friends; maybe we were the closest family he ever had.\n\nMoments later Oscar came running out of the darkness, still naked and still prancing but completely dry. \n\n“Aw what’s wrong Osky? Water too cold?” Anya pouted her lips and batted her eyelashes in a mock display of sympathy. \n\nUnfazed, Oscar pushed a flop of blonde hair out of his eyes. “The water is beautiful,” he said. “I just don’t want to go in alone.” His eyes scanned the circle and locked on mine. He gave me a stupid, toothy grin and said, “I want Stevie to come in with me.”\n\nI was the youngest in the group and they got a kick out of making me squirm. It didn’t help that my cheeks flushed red everytime they pushed me to do something that I wasn’t comfortable with. I felt my face get hot. “No, I don’t think so,” I started to say, my eyes darting down to the sand. “I–”\n\nAnya leaned forward and gently held my face in her hands. “Look at him! Oh my God, Oscar, you’re gonna make him cry.” \n\n“No, I–” My eyes met hers and my mind went blank. Big, brown, caked in mascara and shimmering in the light of the fire, in that moment she was everything I had ever wanted. “I’ll do it.”\n\n“Yay!” Anya squealed with delight. \n\nI pushed myself to my feet, heart pounding in my tightened chest, and took my clothes off. Oscar grabbed my hand and smiled. I’ll never forget the look in his eyes. It was the look not only of a grateful friend, but one of a proud father. A look that carried warmth and acceptance. For a moment, I couldn’t feel the icy wind or the eyes on my naked body. All I could feel was love. And the next thing I knew, we were running down the beach towards the surf, shrieking with laughter. \n\nBut with each step forward, I became more aware of the ocean ahead. The vast, freezing ocean. I could suddenly hear the waves crashing and the wind screaming in my ears. My heart pounded up into my head and my breaths got shorter. And when my feet hit that sharp, biting water, I froze. Oscar kept running, though. And I could only watch as he splashed and danced before me, alone, getting smaller and smaller until he disappeared under the black water and all that was left was the moon. \n\nThey didn’t find Oscar’s body for two days. I remember watching his parents at the funeral, his mother weeping silently and his father sitting stone faced, staring straight ahead, not betraying any emotion. Needless to say, things changed after that. It was the beginning of the end for many of us. Anya took Oscar’s death the hardest, moving on to harder drugs and eventually fading away as just another warped memory. I think she blamed herself. It was her dare, afterall. But deep down, I always knew the truth. I was the one who had frozen. I was the one who let him go in alone. I was the one who had abandoned him. And I was the one who watched him die. \n\nI spent most of the following year at home alone. I withdrew from my family – not that they tried to help much. They were happy enough to believe I was fine. But I wasn’t. I couldn’t sleep without the TV on, because as soon as I was alone in the dark with nothing but my thoughts, all I could see was Oscar’s face. That look in his eyes – my last memory of him – it made me sick with guilt. He trusted me and he loved me and I let him down. And now he was dead. \n\nIt wasn’t long after that the nightmares began. I remember the first time it happened. I was lying awake in my bed – I was sure I was awake – when I became aware of a faint clicking sound. My body tensed and became frozen. The clicking got louder and closer as the features of my room fell away and the familiar shadows melted into a black, formless void around my bed. \n\nThere he was. Standing before me, pale and dripping wet, hair matted to his forehead. Long, skinny arms wrapped around his shivering naked body. His face looked scared and confused, almost panicked. But his eyes were no longer the soft, curious baby blue that had once brought me so much comfort. They were a dead milky white and sunken back into his head. Staring directly into mine.\n\n“C-c–c-” he whispered through his violently chattering teeth, “Cold. I’m so cold. Stevie, he-he-help me. I-I’m so c-c-cold. P-p-p-p-please… he-he-help me…” \n\nI tried to scream but only choked. I was helplessly paralyzed as he stood at the foot of my bed in bewildered despair, desperate, shivering, begging me for help. \n\nGradually, his face started to change. His confusion and fear slowly transformed, as if he was remembering something. “H-h-how could you leave me? H-h-how… You were my f-f-f-friend,” Oscar’s expression turned to hurt. To disbelief. “You left me… you…” He paused. For a moment, there was silence. \n\n“YOU LEFT ME.” he screamed and shot forward onto my bed, crawling towards me, chattering teeth louder and louder as he clawed forward until they were jackhammers pounding in my chest. “YOU LEFT ME. YOU LEFT ME. YOU LEFT ME.” He was on top of me as I layed completely immobilized, face inches from mine, crawling with spidery purple veins and soaking my bed as ice cold water dripped from his twisted, writhing body, choking me with the smell of brine. “HOW COULD YOU LEAVE ME!”\n\nAnd he was gone. My room was back. I jumped out of bed to turn on the lights. I could still smell saltwater in the air. But I was alone.\n\nThese nightmares continued for years. They were always the same. First, the chattering of teeth and the smell of seawater would signify a visit. The room would fall away into blackness and there he was, shivering at the foot of my bed. Pleas for help. Confusion. Desperation. Then a slow realization. Betrayal. Hurt. And finally rage. I stopped sleeping. Stopped turning my light off. Kept my door open. And sometimes I would go weeks or even months without seeing him. But inevitably, the nightmares would return. \n\nThe first time I told anyone about this was in college. Half a decade of poor sleep had fried my nerves and I ended up visiting the University’s mental health counselor for support. He was the first person to tell me about sleep paralysis. Apparently it's a fairly common phenomenon. The sufferer will be awake but they won’t be able to move. This is because their body has entered REM sleep and their muscles have shut off before their brain has, causing mental consciousness with physical paralysis. Oftentimes these episodes are accompanied by a feeling of panic or dread, and, strangely, it is not uncommon for people with sleep paralysis to see what they believe to be a dark figure or malevolent presence above them. The technical term for this is a “hypnagogic hallucination.” That, in conjunction with the PTSD and survivors guilt of watching my friend drown in front of me, led to my specific, reoccuring experience of this condition. With medication and dedicated therapy, he said, we would be able to treat the symptoms while addressing the underlying causes.\n\nAnd it worked. Gradually, I got better. I started taking meds and finally, for the first time, opening up about what had happened and how it affected me. I was able to let go and forgive my thirteen-year-old self for my inaction that night. And most importantly I began to sleep. \n\nLife went on. I graduated college, found a career, met a girl. Cindy. She balanced out my restlessness and overthinking with a soft tranquility. She was nothing like me and it was exactly what I needed. I lived quietly and happily. \n\nOne weekend, Cindy had to leave town to visit family and asked if I could watch her dog while she was away. She had her own apartment in the outer Sunset. A quiet weekend alone sounded nice.\n\nIt was already past ten when I took her dog out for his walk that night. I had a windbreaker over a hoodie, but the wind was strong and I was chilled through as soon as we stepped out onto the street. We walked down Noriega and past the Great Highway and before I knew it we were at Ocean Beach. \n\nIt hadn’t even crossed my mind. But I hadn’t set foot on that sand in over ten years. Since the night Oscar died. And here I was, descending the concrete steps past the sea wall, moving almost automatically into the darkness. The waves turned over in the distance and the moon hung low in the sky, faint behind the gray mist above the water. I stared out at that lonely moon and felt comfort, proud of how far I had come.\n\nI was snapped out of my head when Cindy’s dog suddenly bolted, barking into the darkness. “Shit,” I muttered, and took off after him, calling his name. I ran as fast as I could following the sound of his barks as they moved towards the water ahead of me. As I approached the surf, the smell of saltwater hit me and I froze. There he was, standing before me, knee deep in black water. Pale and dripping wet, hair matted to his forehead. Long, skinny arms wrapped around his shivering naked body. Teeth chattering. Eyes white.\n\nMy body locked up and I couldn’t move. Paralyzed again. The beach fell away into blackness. The dog’s bark trailed off into silence. All I could hear was that awful clicking sound of Oscar’s chattering teeth as they gnashed together behind his blue lips. He walked towards me, trembling, milky eyes locked on mine. Approached me. Stood face to face. Leaned over. Whispered in my ear.\n\n“You left me.”\n\nThe next thing I knew I was thrashing wildly in the icy waves, gasping for breath, fighting with bewildered desperation to keep my head above water but something was pulling me under, down, down into the inky murk and I swallowed and gagged on sea water as I tried to scream and fight for air but the water was so cold, I felt my arteries constrict and my lungs tighten up and everything was black and violent and bewildering and I felt thin fingers on my throat squeezing tighter and tighter until I finally broke free and found the sand under my feet and I clawed through the sea away from the moon and towards the land until finally, finally I collapsed panting on the beach, Cindy's dog crying and licking the salt from my face and the blood from my neck. I winced in pain as I felt the pulsating scratches and I looked back towards the deserted surf, calm and lonely and beautiful.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorking in the jungles of the Amazon as PMC, I saw many things. Villages with little to no technology, giant snakes, beautiful, vibrant birds, creatures I had never even heard of before. I worked with a team of biologists, scouting a few kilometers of territory alongside the amazon river. There were five of us. These four biologists knew what they were doing, and each had several expeditions under their names. I had gotten to know them for a few weeks as they researched, I was there as protection against tribes, poachers, or anything that could be thought of. They had reasons to hire me, after all, they were extremely experienced in this line of work and knew where they needed help.\n\nThey hired me from Tungsten, a Private Military Company based out of Louisiana. I’d grown up there, and after my time in the army, I joined Tungsten. This was my first job, and as a solo job, it was going to be a tough one. I met the team, four young biologists with Harvard degrees and dreams to discover new species. Tom, Brooke, Pete, and Freddy greeted me and briefed me as soon as we met up at the airport in Brazil. They shook my hand, and eagerly explained what findings they hoped to achieve. This was their second expedition to the Amazon as a team of four, and for Tom, it was his fifth to the Amazon in total.\n\nWe landed on a dirt runway, aboard a converted C-47. The locals seemed interested in my modified rifle, with a laser, red dot sight, and suppressor. A truck shortly arrived to pick us up, and we sat in the bed for a two hour ride, which ended on a curve of the road, in the beginning of the forest. We got out, thanked the driver with a generous tip, and headed off. I had no idea what was going on, so I just followed them. They excitedly made their way into the jungle, pointing out species of trees and insects as we made our way through the dense foliage. The top of the rainforest covered most of the ground in dark shadows, leaving it looking like it was midnight, for months at a time. We made our way to a small clearing, and with a few slashes of a machete, the small bushes and sprouts were cut down, leaving room for our tents.\n\nBrooke and Pete shared a tent, while Freddy and Tom used net covered hammocks. I used one as well, as the thought of a giant centipede crawling up my leg made me shudder. I kept a small Walther .22lr at my waist in case of such. As night fell and we grew tired, a large feeling of dread crept over me. Like I was being watched, by something that really didn’t me there. I had heard about explorers being torn apart by wild animals, so I sat up, chambered a round in my rifle, and waited.\n\n“Wake up man, I’ve got breakfast for you.” I jolted awake, gripping my rifle, only to see Pete offering me a few strips of bacon. “Didn’t mean to scare you, that’s my bad man, but here’s some bacon. It’s not the best, but it’s what we’ve got.” I took the few strips I was handed, wolfed them down. I gave him a thank you for the breakfast, before standing up to take a piss. I walked 5 yards from the camp, and stared out into the jungle. My eyes were still blurred from sleep, but as they focused, I saw someone, something that gave me chills. It was a disembodied face, with spikes rising from the top of its head, a wicked grin, raised eyebrows, and squinted eyes. Its face was spherical in shape, and was lined by a thick mane of dirty fur. I blinked, and it turned around and barreled away. It had to have been at least 8 feet tall, with its muscled body covered in mud and wounds.\n\nI took a few steps into camp, where I met the others. “I swear I just saw some giant… thing! It was tall, with horns, and a fucked up smile. Wha-” \n\n“Woah man, calm down, breathe,” spoke Tom. “When you’re in the jungle, you see things. You get used to them. But sometimes, they aren’t friendly. Why do you think you’re here?” The rest nodded in agreement.\n\nI stood there in disbelief. There’s no way that they were so acceptant of the fact that a fucking monster out of a horror movie was stalking us, and that I was supposed to be cool with that too. \n\n“How are you guys okay with this? I’m just one guy, what if it gets me? Then who will protect you?” I shouted at them.\n\n“Oh don’t worry, that won’t happen.” Tom said with a smile.\n\nAs the day went on, the group left in pairs, telling me to stay with the other two that remained at the camp. I kept my rifle on fire at all times, as I was scared shitless of that monster that lurked in the jungle. As night began to fall for the second day, I crawled into my hammock with my rifle in my lap, and I kept a cup to piss in just in case I had to go. I wasn’t getting out in the middle of the night. As I started to get drowsy, I heard what sounded like whispering. I peeked over the side to see the group of four standing around the fire, holding hands, whispering. Things weren’t seeming so normal anymore, not that they had for the entirety of this ordeal. \n\nAs I sat there wondering what to do, I started to lose consciousness. When I awoke, I was near a creek bed, as the four stood over me, all smiling just like the monster. My arms and legs were tied down, and Tom wielded a knife. They had cut my shirt off, and I can only assume were ready to carve into me and do whatever sick shit they had planned, but they failed to tie my left hand as tight as my right, and fortunately for me, they didn’t notice my pistol at my waist. A plan came to my mind, all I had to do was wait.\n\n“You sick motherfuckers! You gonna kill? For what?” I yelled.\n\n“Well, you’ve already seen Kazte-Ka. Just know that your sacrifice will be very welcomed by him, and we are pleased to deliver your heart to him. In fact-”\n\n“Shut up with the cheesy lines Tom, just get it over with.” I interrupted. \n\n“Well, if you say so.” The four said at once.\n\nThey began to pray in unison, words I couldn’t understand, as Tom raised his knife. As he looked up at the knife, holding it with both hands, I reached for my pistol, and fired. He fell to the ground holding his neck, blood spraying out. I opened fire at the other three, firing wildly at them. .22lr isn’t as the 5.56 Hollow Points I had loaded in my rifle, So I put as many rounds into them as I could. Pete fell down holding his chest, while Freddy stumbled into the bushes behind him. Brooke tried to find the knife, but I loaded another magazine and dispatched her. I aimed at Freddy, fueled by rage, and pulled the trigger. I felt unexpectedly good at that moment, and the jungle fell silent for the first time since I had arrived.\n\nI caught my breath, and made my way up the small incline to the camp. We weren’t far off the road so I knew it wouldn't be a long walk. I grabbed my radio and my rifle, and set off. As I neared the road, I heard loud thumps behind me, and I started running, knowing that the beast was coming. Before I knew it, it reached me and knocked me on my ass. I turned around to try to fire at it, but my shots missed as it grabbed my leg and thundered back into the jungle, dragging me along. After what seemed like miles, it threw me against a tree. As I stared up at the jungle ceiling, I saw light peeking through, realizing that the sun was rising.\n\nMy vision blurred and I heard its manic breathing and grunts as it slammed its fist onto my chest several times. I laid there unable to move, as I watched it disappear back into the jungle. Soon, I felt insects crawling over me, even the centipedes I was so fearful of. Sometimes they took a bite, running away when I screamed in pain. As night began to set, I heard footsteps. I looked, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw Brazilian soldiers coming to me with water. \n\nNow, as I sit in my wheelchair at my home in an undisclosed location, I see the Kazte-Ka sometimes. I’ll see it in my dreams, out in the fields, or sometimes in my home. Never moving, only staring, whispering t\n\nhe same chants the four biologists whispered as they prepared to kill me. Maybe after I recover, I’ll head back. And maybe, I’ll bring a few friends, to give to Kazte-Ka.",

        "text": "The thing is, I was distracted by his teeth. They were white, like white-white, he was smiling wide enough to show me the back molars and I was thinking how his job must have an amazing dental plan and I was wondering if I should check out the Eisley Gardens career page to see if they were hiring and so I only kind of heard the low drone of real estate jargon, “Blah blah locally sourced construction materials… blah blah cutting-edge advancement in the kitchen cabinetery industry… blah blah blah crafted to the finest specifications...”\n\nI’ve never given that much thought to kitchen handle specifications, but I could tell this apartment was crafted to be fucking nice. The floorboards glowed, the countertops glistened, mile-high windows gave way to a view of the city that would make a photographer weep. \n\n“Are you sure you’re showing me the right place?” I asked. “My budget is -”\n\n“Here at Eisley Gardens, we believe people have more to offer than money,” He said, and I wondered how much of a man’s salary he could reasonably blow on Crest White Strips, “Everyone is expected to contribute to the community, but that contribution doesn’t always need to be monetary.”\n\n“What does it need to be?”\n\n“Many areas of the community are still under construction. Insulation in the upper floors, paving the front courtyard, that sort of thing. If you’re willing to contribute to ongoing projects, we’re in a position to negotiate on price. Just think. You could be living in this apartment tonight.”\n\nAnd maybe I should have read more of the fine print before signing a contract, but the only other housing I could find near my price range was a house share with an eighty minute commute. One of my potential roommates made her living breeding cats in the backyard. This place is quiet, beautiful, two stops to work on an air conditioned train, and the only thing breeding out here was the yeast in my neighbor’s homemade organic blackberry kombucha. \n\nMy sister had a few questions like, “Isn’t expecting people to work in exchange for housing exploitative?” and “Isn’t that area supposed to be a city park?” and “Why can’t I find any information about this development online?” but the thing you’ve got to understand about her is she’s super judgmental about everything. \n\nAnd the place was great. I could actually sleep without hearing my neighbor’s oboe recital through the wall and the bed was… I don’t even know what it was but I slept like the dead. It was a bit drafty without the insulation being done, but utilities are included so I just jacked up the heat like a winner. If company towns included underfloor heating, leather sofas, and ivory doorknobs those guys probably wouldn’t have complained so much.\n\nI would have done a thousand weekends of community service to keep this place, but they didn’t call me up that weekend and I figured they were giving me some time to settle in. I wondered about it when I didn’t get a call the next week or the week after that, but no one posted an eviction notice.\n\nI was a little bit worried when I woke up with my hair missing. \n\nBut the thing about that was it was only a little patch. I ran my hand through my hair that morning only to discover a circle of bare skin on the left side of my scalp. And the apartment did get warmer after that. They finished the insulation and sent me a card thanking me for my contribution even though, again, I did not pick up a set of tools that whole month. I thought about calling them to admit I hadn’t worked on it, but like my sister said, there’s no trace of the development online. \n\nMaybe I should have put things together then, but seriously, who loses some hair in the night and thinks it’s being used for building insulation? That’s crazy. I’m not crazy, that’s crazy.\n\nOnly here’s the thing. \n\nToday, I was helping customers at work, when my mouth was suddenly filled with blood. Which isn’t an ideal quality for the mouth of a customer service representative at Wholesale Mart to have, so my boss sent me home to sleep it off. And as I was taking those two stops on the train, I nudged the cotton wool aside with my tongue to find that I was missing two back molars. One on each side. It happened in a second, it didn’t even hurt, they were just gone.\n\nWhen I got to my development, I noticed the front courtyard was finally paved over. I tried not to look down as I made my way to my front door, but the thing is I did and it was teeth. The whole damn courtyard was paved with tiny human teeth. They must have taken some from everyone in the building. I got into my front door and found the little card on the ground along with my junk mail and bank statements. \n\nThe front courtyard is now paved! Thank you for your contribution.\n\nMy sister's calling this whole situation \"terrifying\" and \"a Faustian nightmare\" and hounding me to find a new place. But this apartment is nice, especially with that new courtyard. They kind of did me a solid, really, because now I get a day off work. Two, if you count the day I’ll have to take off for the dental appointment. There’s no way I’m gonna find anything else in the area for this price, and it’s so nice. How much more development could it possibly need, right? \n\nRight?",

        "text": "All my life, I was given many lessons by my parents. If I didn't follow any of the rules or understand their lessons, I would be given a belt whack.\n\nTheir first lesson was teaching me dominance. This was mostly by my dad, as he was the more dominant parent. He'd tell me that women weren't to be believed, as whatever they say is total lies.\n\nNow, some few weeks ago, I'd gotten a girlfriend. But shortly after, she left. I was doing what I was supposed to do according to the rules, but those didn't make her stay. She left me, saying I was an \"asshole.\"\n\nI was homeschooled, too. Very sheltered, now that I know the word for it. I was supposed to assert dominance, and I was told that only the males that did what we were doing were the real humans, and that women or men that didn't conform were not people.\n\nI always believed these things, but I had a big waking moment the other night.\n\nIt was right before the Solstice that we started getting strange notes. They were written in some sort of runic script. As far as I can tell, they looked like threats written on paper. They appeared to be death threats.\n\n\"Donny, ignore them. Just some non-human's prank.\"\n\nDad had always called people non-human. In an effort to keep up the ruse I was under for years.\n\nBut these notes kept coming. Multiplying. It was as if we were being given more notes than we were burning them.\n\nAnd then, last Christmas Eve, something very crazy had happened.\n\nMy heart was pounding as if it were loudly knocking on a wooden door. I knew if I didn't get to sleep at 6:00 pm, I'd get the belt. But this routine thing went off track. I had a hard time sleeping that night, meaning I had the fear of the belt come in again, but this time, no one came in.\n\nI heard screams of terror from my parents' room. From then, my heart banged like the Big Ben tower, but as rapid as a race car.\n\n\"HELP!! HELLLLP!!\"\n\nAnd I remembered I had a present under the tree. It had been there, but I was told opening it before Christmas would make the object inside vanish.\n\nBut as I checked to make sure it was still there, apparently it looked as if the whole present vanished.\n\nI looked around for it, scared out of my skin thinking it was stolen. I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. Then I heard a bellowing voice.\n\n\"Come out, Donny! I know you're in here! Get over here!\"\n\nAnd this voice alone gave me the creeps.\n\n\"Coal in the stocking wasn't enough to tell you that you were incredibly evil! Donny, get over here!\"\n\nEvil? Me? I was shaking in my boots when the voice began to grow louder.\n\n\"Just what have you been doing all this time? You have some *real* lessons to learn, Donny!\"\n\nThis time, I was crouching as though I was trying to hide. Sweat had poured from my head like a fountain. I was reaching a breaking point. And then, what appeared before me was the face of a strange, goat-like creature. His horns were long, reaching at least 15 feet.\n\n\"You're getting in the basket, boy!\"\n\nThen he grabbed me by the shirt I wore and I was dropped into his basket. The inside of it reminded me of the TARDIS; it was larger inside than it was outside. The fact that I was indeed picked up by Krampus made many scary thoughts come to mind. I wondered what he was going to do to me. Was he going to kill me? Was he going to beat me worse than my dad did?\n\nAnd then, I saw my parents. They were apparently knocked out.\n\nI was shaking, but I kept trying to find the courage to talk to Krampus. I was stuttering, but I said this to him,\n\n\"What d-did I do t-to make you s-so mad?\"\n\n\"You're not fooling me! You know what you did!\"\n\n\"I had r-rules to f-follow.\"\n\n\"Rules, my left hoof! You tell me what you did! I know what you did, but you have to understand!\"\n\n\"Understand what, s-sir?\"\n\n\"Show me that you remember your sins! Tell me!\"\n\n\"Th-then you u-understand that my p-parents w-were abusive? Th-that I had to do what they s-said or I'd be b-b-belted?\"\n\n\"Color me unsurprised, Donny. Your parents made you think your sins were normal things? Just what kind of a rock have you been living under?\"\n\n\"I-I know there's a w-word for it... but I d-don't th-think I learned it.\"\n\n\"Sheltered, kid. You were sheltered the whole time. Tell me what you did. All these years.\"\n\nAnd I admitted everything. The time I misgendered and made fun of one of the girls in class (she was trans), the time I threatened to shoot the boy in my neighborhood, the stuff I did to my ex-girlfriend, everything. I began to break down crying. I admitted that I was told to do these because it was \"normal,\" and that I had no idea what was wrong with me.\n\n\"I know much of this was my fault, but you have to believe me! It was either do it all or get whipped! I swear, I was so afraid of the consequences...\"\n\n\"You're 16, kid. It's not too late to mend. As for your parents, they're too far gone to change, so I did you and the whole town a favor.\"\n\nI checked on my parents for heartbeats. When I found that there was no heartbeat, I had a realization that... that...\n\n\"Don't feel bad for them. They were manipulative. They were like this for long enough that they could not turn back. As for you, you still have a young mind. You're capable of change. And it's not every day you find a genuinely remorseful soul.\"\n\nI was still shaking in my boots. But I was basically shocked into reality.\n\n\"I-I'll do what I can. I need to make up for it all.\"\n\n\"So you say you'll atone? The promise is normally empty.\"\n\n\"I need some resources for ways I can do it, but I will!\"\n\nAnd then, even as I peered out of the basket, he had evidently turned to me.\n\n\"You've got a new resolve. This is rare. A promise to atone that is genuine. That, too, is rare. Enjoy the rest of the ride.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up Christmas morning to find myself right next to the tree. I at first wondered if it was all a nightmare, but when I checked the whole house, I knew he was right. They really were gone.\n\nI looked on the table, and there was a present on it. Although wrapped in a deep purple, it was definitely something for me.\n\nI opened it to find a Nintendo Switch set, a book with lessons on kindness, and some sort of handbook on respect and advocacy.\n\nAlong with the items was a note that said,\n\n\"Some presents to celebrate the start of your new journey. -K\"",

        "text": " This summer, I went camping in the woods. It was really nice during this time, and it felt great to be outside the city. The smell of the trees was great, and I was calm, hearing the birds flying around. I loved the peace and solitude of being out in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nI had a strange encounter when I was near the edge of the forest, getting out of the car, when a little kid saw me and asked what I was doing there.\n\n“I’m camping there for a few days.”\n\n“I wouldn’t do it. The Father of the Forest doesn’t like when humans invade his territory.”\n\nThe kid then ran away. I never heard of the Father of the Forest before, but I thought maybe it was a video game character from a game the child was playing, then I entered the woods.\n\nIt was already quite dark when I arrived, but it wasn’t a problem, I was planning on staying there for a few days at least, and I had well enough food with me. \n\nI  tried to quickly set up my tent, but I failed. Somehow, I managed to rip it apart, so yeah, it wasn’t ideal. After I couldn’t manage to fix it, I just dropped my sleeping bag on the ground, then tried to sleep, trying to get some much-needed rest. \n\nThe night was still and quiet, the only sounds being the rustling of the leaves in the gentle breeze and the occasional hoot of an owl. I had always loved the peace and solitude of the forest, but as I lay there, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me. \n\nThe trees seemed to loom over me, their gnarled branches reaching out like twisted fingers. The moonlight filtered through the leaves, casting eerie shadows on the ground. The underbrush rustled ominously, as if something was lurking just out of sight. \n\nI tried to brush off my paranoia, telling myself it was just my imagination getting the better of me. But as the night wore on, the feeling only grew stronger. I found myself jumping at every little noise. \n\nIt was strange, the peaceful and calm forest suddenly looked so scary. It wasn’t the first time I was camping there, but it wasn’t so strange before. \n\nI tried to force myself to sleep, but my heart was still beating too quickly. I felt like a little kid when their parents switched off the lights in the room. \n\nSuddenly, I heard a sound that sent a chill down my spine. It was a low, guttural growl, coming from deep inside the woods. My heart pounded in my chest as I fumbled for my flashlight, my hands shaking with fear.\n\nI stood up and looked around. It was probably nothing interesting, but I wanted to look around, just to make sure nothing was around, trying to calm my childish mind.\n\nI was right. I saw a few birds on the trees, but nothing extraordinary. I was alone, there was nobody else there. \n\nAs I lay back and tried to sleep again, I heard the sound again. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. It was deep, with a strange, otherworldly quality to it. It seemed to echo and reverberate through the forest, as if it was coming from all around me at once.\n\nI couldn't make out any words, just a series of strange, garbled noises that sent shivers down my spine. It was like listening to the voice of some ancient, primordial beast.\n\n“What in the fucking hell is this?” I muttered. I heard that voice for like an hour, and it still hadn’t stopped, but I managed to fall asleep.\n\nI woke up the next morning, feeling disoriented and groggy. It took me a moment to remember where I was. I stayed there for a few minutes, then stood up. I searched for some food for breakfast in my backpack.\n\nWhen I finished eating, I wanted to go fishing, there was a small lake nearby, and it seemed like a great and fun activity. As I was walking, I noticed something strange.\n\nTrees were toppled over, their roots exposed and writhing like snakes. Branches were broken and scattered everywhere, as if some giant hand had swept through the woods and left a trail of destruction in its wake. *What the fuck is this?*\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes. How had this happened? I had been camping in that spot just the night before, and everything had been perfectly normal. Had I slept through some kind of natural disaster?\n\nI walked around, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. As I moved deeper into the woods, the destruction only seemed to get worse. It was as if something had ripped through the forest, tearing everything in its path.\n\nThere wasn’t a storm there the night before. What could’ve done this? I suddenly felt pretty uncomfortable there, so I decided to go home. I didn’t want to stay there anymore. I felt unsafe.\n\nI walked back towards the edge of the forest, towards my car. As I arrived there, I just stood there in shock. I couldn’t believe what had happened. There was a large tree that fell on my car, destroying it. \n\n“Damn, it will cost millions to repair it,” I said to myself. “It’s probably cheaper to buy a new one.”\n\nThen I remembered something worse than the price of the car. I was stuck in the forest. It was near an old road, there were almost no cars around. Taxis didn’t drive there. I called my friend, asking him if he could come there and bring me home. I explained to him what had happened. He said he could only take me home the following morning. I was stuck there for one more night.\n\nThe day quickly went by, I tried fishing in the lake, but I wasn’t too lucky, I hadn’t seen even one fish there. I had a great lunch and then dinner, I even made a small campfire, just because of the mood. \n\nWhen the night came, I tried to sleep again, hoping this time I could finally sleep in peace, without any distractions. \n\nUnfortunately, I heard the sound again, but it was much closer. I felt like it came from a maximum of a hundred meters away. And it was coming towards me.\n\nIt came closer and closer. I had no idea what kind of animal could howl like that. It was terrifying. Was it a wolf? No, it wasn’t a wolf. It was something entirely different. It sounded more like a gigantic whale. \n\nAs it came closer, I was shaking in my sleeping bag, thinking about what to do. I suddenly had this idea, to climb to the top of a tree. I chose the tree that was the closest to me. \n\nI climbed to the top, hiding behind the branches. And the thing that caused the sound was even closer. After my vision had adjusted to the darkness, I saw what it was. \n\nThe creature was walking on two legs, its tall, lanky frame towering over the trees. It had a strange head structure, with a long, pointed snout and two large, glowing red eyes. Its skin was a deep, mottled green, and it had a pair of massive horns that curved up from its head like those of a moose.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing. This thing was more than three meters tall, with long, powerful legs and arms that ended in sharp, clawed hands. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, and I was terrified.\n\nI watched as it moved through the woods, its feet pounding the ground with each step. It seemed to be sniffing the air, as if it was searching for something. I had a feeling it was searching for me. It grabbed a tree with its strong arms, then broke it. The tree fell to the ground with a loud noise.\n\nI knew I had to get out of there, but I was frozen with fear. I couldn't move, couldn't even breathe. All I could do was watch as the creature moved closer and closer, and suddenly, its glowing red eyes looked at me. \n\nI thought I was going to suffocate there as I still held my breath. It saw me. The thing knew I was there. Maybe it could see even in the dark. Then it howled again, opening its terrifying mouth. \n\nI immediately jumped down from the tree. My legs hurt because of the height, but I didn’t care, I just ran as fast as I could, leaving behind my backpack. After a few minutes of running, I reached the road where my broken car was. \n\nI didn’t stop there, I ran further away from the woods. I hid a few hundred meters away, at the edge of the road, eventually falling asleep there. I was lucky my friend could take me home the following morning.\n\nAs I was in the car and looked back to the forest, I could see that even more trees were laying on the ground. I remembered the kid I met near the forest. The creature was the Father of the Forest. And it was the last time I was camping in a forest.",

        "text": "I am the former officer Steven smith.I worked in Texas as a policeman and today I am going to share about some of the most horrible cases I had to deal with.\nI woke up one day thinking it was a normal day,I ate breakfast and went out to my job. I munched on a few donuts on the way and I was notified about a report filed just now near my home. It was about a missing girl.Just to make you all clear missing girls cases were common those days so I thought it was a nother normal case that was going to be a fail. I was informed about the lane and everything so it was the last house in my neighborhood.I went to the house and waited for another officer they were sending, Unfortunately he came an hour late. I started a conversation cuz I was kinda mad about him coming late.\n\nMe: Are you the officer?\nHim: yea\nMe: what took u so long?\nHim: I am new to this state so it was kinda hard finding the correct place.\nMe: Eh kinda relatable I guess.\n Him: so you know the deal right?\nMe: yea let's go in the house.\n\nWe both approached the house and knocked\n\nMe: Hello anyone there?\nSilence*\nMe: Hello??\nSilence*\n2nd officer: Let's just break the door down\nMe: guess its the only way\n\nWe broke the door down.After going in we found out the house was huge inside. Me and the officer agreed to split up saying he'd go in the 2nd floor to find evidences and I'd search in the ground floor. After I went searching for evidences of the missing girl  I found nothing  After searching for a little more I found an old room. It was kind of far from other rooms and was in the dark corner of the house.I went in and saw a normal family room a good ol' piano, a nice cozy carpet, A T.V ,An unlight fire place and suddenly I heard a creak sound.I guessed the room was really old. I stepped out the room and went to find my partner and heard another creak sound from the same room. I remembered I had closed the door while coming out but it was open now.\n\n...... \n\nWe weren't alone in the house. \n\n''HRWAAAAPHAASSS'' \n\nAs soon as I heard that sound I saw 2 zombie like humans. Their face was half skinless I could see the whole oral cavity of them, They had they eye sockets ripped and one of them had their eyes dangling out of their socket.\n\nAs soon as I saw those things I didn't think of anything and fled outside and forgot my partner was in their.\n\nThe screams were still screaming...\n\n''HWAAAKWAAALAADOWAAADWATHA\"\n \nThen I heard a gunshot and then silence. \n\nMy partner: Where are you?!....Did u seriously get scared?!.....Those were probably some victims of the kidnapper of their daughter!.....The guy probably forgot to finish his work!\n\nMe: Oh! Ok then! Did you kill em?!\n\nPartner: No! We need them. We need every piece of evidence!\n\nMe: Oh yea! Just lock them in a room!\n\nHim: Ok, Come one help me out!\n\nMe: Ok!\n\nAs I was heading in the house I again heard a sound...\n\nIt was coming from my back.\n\n''DAANTHAAGAA\"\n\nAnd as I turned around I saw a person with only his torso... His rob cage was showing and his intestines were spilling, His head was partly dissolved he was with no clothes and he had a badge hanging off this chest. The badge spelt Officer Williams and the rest was covered in blood. I found out that he was my partner but then... Who was in the house?...\n\nI ran to the car as soon as possible locked the doors and saw a man running at me screaming \" DONT GO!!!\". I ran until I was out of the neighborhood. As I got out of their I saw a old cabinet with a dissolved skull hanging at the window. I took a picture and went to the police station I reported everything and re-signed.\n\nAs I went home I saw the same man who I thought was my partner waiting in my house. But he.. was bodyless... Someone else was with him... I didn't think a second thought and moved out of Texas after that the same day.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I need some advice on what to do with a family bible I found at my Grandfather’s house. \n\nHe died nearly a year ago in December. We’d always been close, and since my own father passed away years ago from cancer, the responsibility of dealing with Grandpa’s estate had fallen to me. \n\nI arrived one snowy evening just before Christmas, armed with trash bags and cleaning supplies. \n\nThe house was exactly as I remembered it- dated, yet welcoming and familiar. I felt sad. This house was a happy place for me, and I had a lot of good memories here. I dreaded selling it.\n\nThe interior was cold from having the heat turned down, l so I decided to light a fire in the fireplace while I worked. The flames spread quickly on the dry kindling, and crackled cheerfully behind the grate.\n\nI poured myself a bourbon from the decanter (thanks Grandpa) and turned to the bookshelves.\n\nGrandpa had always loved to read, and his shelves were filled with books. I had been looking forward to going through his collection and actually planned on keeping a few for myself. I smiled when I pulled down weathered copies of *East of Eden, Kim,* and *All the King’s Men.*\n\nBut the next book I pulled down made me frown. It was a family bible, fragile with age. The leather spine cracked when I opened it and flipped its dry pages.\n\nI felt guilty for tossing it, but this just wasn’t for me. I was an atheist, more or less, and it just felt odd to keep a worn out bible. I flipped back to the front cover, where there were handwritten notes- a list of births and deaths in the family going back almost two hundred years. I was surprised to see my own name at the bottom.\n\nTaylor Smith, b.1991, d. 2036\n\nI shivered. It was so bizarre. Why was I listed in the family bible with a future death date?\n\nThe thing gave me the creeps. I was suddenly very aware of how alone I was in the house, on a cold winter’s evening.\n\nI continued to pilfer through the books, but the rest of the evening felt tainted by that discovery. I glanced nervously over at the coffee table, where the bible sat innocently.\n\nI polished off the bourbon and decided to open it again. It gave me an odd feeling, even to hold it. Like it was full of power.\n\nAnd there it was. My name, with a death date of 2036. I hadn’t imagined it.\n\nIt felt wrong. I thought about putting it in the trash bag, with the other unwanted books. Then I looked up at the fireplace. \n\nI know I shouldn’t have, but I did. I put it in the fire. And I watched it burn slowly, the pages curling with flame. \n\nAfter that I felt much better. I even laughed at how silly I’d been to let a book spook me.\n\nI went to bed with a clear conscience. \n\nThe next day I moved into the bedroom. I bagged clothes and shoes, half of them for Goodwill and the rest for the dumpster. It was only when I turned to his nightstand that I saw it again.\n\nThere was the family bible, sitting on a stack of books.\n\nI thought I was crazy. Surely I’d had too much to drink last night and I’d dreamed the whole thing up.\n\nI was curious. I had to open it. And sure enough, there it was:\n\nTaylor Smith, b.1991, d. 2033\n\nI felt my chest tighten with fear. Hadn’t it said 2036 last night? In.. my dream? This was unnatural. I flung it into a trash bag, tied it up and hauled it outside to the growing pile of garbage near the curb.\n\n*It’s got to be a joke. A cruel, horrible joke,* I thought to myself.\n\nBut who would do that? Grandpa loved me. He would never do something like this.\n\nI continued cleaning and purging, but the rest of the day I felt uneasy. The other stuff in the house was so mundane. Ordinary. I saw nothing atypical at all.\n\nOn the third day, I went to the attic. \n\nThere was a lot of crap up there, dusty furniture and piles of old junk. Most of it was trash, and I dutifully hauled bag after bag to the curb. \n\nI went through all of the furniture as well. None of it was empty. Piles of old china and knicknacks clogged the shelves. *Ok, plates to goodwill, and the rest to the trash*, I thought as I segregated the items.\n\nAn antique dresser sat in the corner of the room. I pulled out the drawers and inspected the contents. Family photographs, scrapbooks. \n\nAnd of course, the bible.\n\nMy heart dropped when I saw it. I felt nauseated. My skin grew clammy. \n\nSlowly, I pulled it out and opened the front cover. \n\nTaylor Smith, b.1991, d. 2030\n\nI felt frozen with fear. My pulse raced, and my ears rang.\n\nI flipped the pages, and this time a letter fell out. I carefully unfolded the yellowed paper.\n\n*This book is not what it seems. It may appear as a bible, but it is something far older and darker. It has been in our family for many years, and it is our role to protect it from those who search for it, those who would abuse it, and those who would use it to harm us.* \n\n*I made the mistake of telling your father. He tried to destroy it, and it cut his life short. Do not make the same mistake that he did.*\n\n*Keep it secret, keep it safe. If you do, you will live a long, happy life like I did.*\n\n*Love,* \n\n*Grandpa*\n\nI was spooked. I gave up on cleaning for the day and took the bible and letter downstairs to the living room. I needed to think. I lit another fire and poured a drink.\n\nAfter a few minutes I felt brave enough to read the letter again.\n\nI sat for a long time in his armchair, staring at the flames deep in thought.\n\nI messed up. I’d tried to destroy the book three times already. And now it had reduced my life expectancy even further.\n\nNow I understood there was some reason for my dad’s life being cut short. When he’d been diagnosed with cancer four years ago it had come as a complete shock. He’d always been healthy. I didn’t know how I felt about this piece of information.\n\nWhatever this was, it had scared him, and he’d tried to destroy it. He’d tried to prevent it from getting to me. \n\nI contemplated the bible laying on the coffee table. I decided to open it and look at it, really examine it this time. I picked it up and held it in my lap, opening to a page at random. The translucent pages rustled beneath my fingertips.\n\nGrandpa was right. It wasn’t what it seemed to be.\n\nIt was a bible, sure.. but when I tried to read it, the letters swam before my eyes and the text grew hot beneath my fingertips. I got a brief flash in my mind of something horrible-\n\n*nails driven behind fingernails, flesh bubbling over fire, a pierced eye leaking a bloody milk, rope twisting around a slim neck-*\n\nbefore I snapped back to the reality of the armchair and fire.\n\nIt took a minute for my heartbeat to slow and my breathing to return to normal. I took a shaky gulp of my bourbon. I’d flung the bible to the floor, where it rested open to a page in Ezekiel.\n\nI don’t know where I went or who those people were, but I had a strange certainty that they were my ancestors.\n\nMaybe the ones who hadn’t cared properly for the book?\n\nI can’t explain it. I knew it was a bad idea as soon as the thought entered my head. Still, I couldn’t stop myself from jumping up and reaching for it again.\n\nIf I was right, I’d be able to talk to him one final time..\n\n…*the earth spun around me in a nauseating swirl before spitting me out onto a blackened plane of hard earth. I struggled to move, my limbs heavy. Smoldering air burned my lungs. I lifted my head from the dry soil to see destruction all around me, piles of corpses, mutilated and burnt. I was startled when one of them jerkily turned its head and screamed at me.*\n\n*“Don’t come here again!” His wasted maw gasped out. “It will draw their attention!”*\n\nI think I was flung back to reality by my own shock more than anything. \n\nI’d know that face anywhere. It was the face of my own father. I’d gone looking for him, and I’d found him. But knowing what happened to him was so much worse than not knowing. Ignorance truly is bliss.\n\nWhoever “they” were, they had come for him when he hadn’t protected the book. And now, they would come for me. My days were numbered too.\n\nI slipped from the armchair into the floor. Tears streamed down my face. I was both thrilled to be alive and tormented by the idea of my father in that hellish, astral plane.\n\nI slipped the bible closed with my toe. Enough of *that* for one evening. \n\nIt took me a long time to fall asleep that night, even with the help of one of grandpa’s pain pills I found in the medicine cabinet. \n\nI left the house the next day. I knew I’d be back after the holidays to keep working on the place. Honestly, I needed to get out of there and clear my head. \n\nI took the bible with me.\n\nAs I drove down the snowy backroads to my house, I could feel its presence in the car. I shivered, and not from the cold. I think I’ll always be able to feel the dark energy now that I’ve visited the astral realm.\n\nI hated being near that thing. But the hard reality was sinking in. I had to become the caretaker of the book. That’s what Grandpa did, and you know who I *didn’t* see in the astral hellscape? Grandpa.\n\nI had to protect it, and I had to atone for my destructive actions any way I could.\n\nWhen I finally pulled into my driveway I had a package from Amazon waiting for me. After unloading the car I heaved the box through the front door and brought it into my bedroom.\n\nThe small combination safe I’d ordered fit perfectly under my nightstand. \n\nI could feel the whispers of power as I pulled the book out of my duffel bag. I carefully slid it into the safe, locked the door, and didn’t touch it for months.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since my little discovery. I finished cleaning out Grandpa’s house in early spring, and had it sold by April. I didn’t find anything else exciting.\n\nI’ve been good this year. I’ve really made an effort to do what Grandpa said in the letter. I’ve also been extra careful about being inconspicuous. No gun purchases, no strange library book checkouts, and no googling “demonic bibles” or anything else that might flag my internet history. I don’t want to do anything to attract the *wrong* kind of attention.\n\nWhen I’m at home though, I always know it’s there. I can especially feel its presence when I lay down at night. \n\nI try to ignore its call. No more trips to the astral plane. Not after what I’ve seen.\n\nIn fact, I’ll do anything to never see that place again. I try to block out what I saw there. It’s easier to do that than accept what happened to dad.\n\nLately though the whispers have been growing louder, and the feeling of dread in my house has been almost unbearable. I finally broke down and opened the safe last week.\n\nWhen I flipped open to the cover page, I was surprised to see that the dates had changed once again- but this time for the better.\n\nTaylor Smith, b.1991, d. 2040\n\nThe book seems pleased with its secure storage. \n\nSo really, the reason I’m posting today is to see if anyone out there has tips on what else I could do to protect it? I really want to show my dedication to keeping it hidden and safe.\n\nI’m not ready to die, and I don’t want to meet the entities that live in the astral realm anytime [soon..](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/)",

        "text": "I'm a 32 year old mother raising a 4 year old boy by myself. My son Caleb struggles with respiratory conditions made worse by the rampant pollution in my home city. His health got so bad this year that I was forced to move us out to an isolated country house surrounded by dense woodlands. The doctors told me that as long as he takes his prescriptions daily and avoids excessive physical activity he should be ok in the long term. \n\nThe problem however, is Caleb's imaginary friend, Tobias. Before we moved here, he had a few imaginary friends I would occasionally hear him talking to. He was a lonely kid, so I figured it was natural for him to make some mental friends. But as soon as we moved he stopped talking to them. I asked him why and he told me that \"Tobias\" didn't want him to talk to them anymore. \n\nThis was a pretty creepy response, but kids say all kinds of weird things. I didn't think much of it and let him be. He went back to his normal behavior after a while. But then one day he suddenly started talking about Tobias again. This time he seemed very excited when he talked about his new imaginary friend.\n\n\"Tobias is really big and strong!\" Caleb said, happily. \"He has reeaaally long arms!\"\n\nI tried hard to keep the smile on my face as he went on, but the more he told me the more it sounded like he was describing some kind of demon. But, whatever right? He's a 4 year old with an active imagination, there's nothing weird about that. I rationalised my uncomfort as well as I could but I still flinched whenever I heard him sitting upstairs chatting away.\n\nThey would play together almost every day and Caleb would tell me all about their adventures. Tobias loved to take him all around the house, exploring and trying new things. Caleb would gush all about the dead rat they found under the deck, or the spider's nest in the corner of his room. It all seemed really strange. I mean, not so much that I could really take action, but enough to unsettle me even more. My suspicions around Tobias grew.\n\nA few weeks ago Caleb took a turn for the worse. His coughing became more frequent, and he barely had any energy. The doctors advised me again to keep his physical activity down, and I tried my best. But every time I'd put him in bed, he'd be out again running around his room. His excuse was always the same.\n\n\"It was Toby's idea!\"\n\nIt got worse from there. The adventures of Caleb and Tobias became...darker. The real wakeup call for me was when I found him opening a window that led to the roof. I pulled him down as he protested. In tears he shouted at me how Tobias told him to, that there was a secret up there and I had to let him see it. After hearing that, I have to admit I lost my cool.\n\nI shouted at Caleb that I didn't want to hear anything about Tobias, and demanded he stop talking to him. I was sick of this stupid \"imaginary friend\" putting my son in harm's way. I expected Caleb to be angry, or sad but when I looked into his big brown eyes all I could see was fear.\n\nThat hit me hard, I never wanted to make him afraid and I shouldn't have reacted so angrily. I began to apologise for my outburst when he started muttering under his breath. The words were soft and quiet and I couldn't quite understand what he was saying. I lent in closer and listened.\n\n\"Please don't take her.\" \n\nCaleb repeated this over and over again. Then it hit me. He wasn't afraid of me. He was afraid FOR me. My skin pricked up in fear and I hugged Caleb tightly. \n\n\"Nobody is gonna take me honey, I'm here, I love you.\" \n\nHe hugged me back and began to cry.\n\n\"I don't wanna play with Toby anymore...\" He whimpered. \n\nI reassured him that he didn't have to play with him, that I'd make him go away. That seemed to calm him and I was able to get him back to sleep, although he did sleep in my bed that night. \n\nAfter that Caleb stopped talking to Tobias. That came as a huge relief to me. His health started to improve and eventually he could leave the house without fear. But I never lost the feeling that something was still with us.\n\nA few days ago I was in the bathroom for my regular morning routine when I heard a loud tap in front of me. I looked into the mirror; no reflection. An invisible hand closed over my mouth, and a chill ran down my spine.\n\n“Shhhhhh. We have so much to talk about.” Came a raspy voice.\n\nI turned around. There was no one there. Spinning back to face the mirror I saw my reflection again and everything was normal. Unsure what to do next, I stood frozen in place for a while. I had just met Toby for the first time. Now I knew for a fact there was something going on.\n\nMy son has been missing since yesterday.\n\nIt was a Sunday. Caleb had gone outside to play and I was cleaning the kitchen. I had just finished washing the dishes when I heard him scream. I rushed out to find him standing in the middle of the backyard, looking around in confusion. I called his name and he turned to look at me.\n\n\"I don't wanna go...\" He said in a fearful tone.\n\nI felt a cold and sharp hand on my shoulder and turned around. Behind me was a towering black creature with long arms and huge white eyes. His mouth was a twisted smile made of fangs. Tobias. \n\nEverything went black. I woke up in the yard covered in rain. Caleb and Tobias were nowhere to be seen. I scoured the house and nearby woodlands, but I haven't seen him since. I think my reflection went with him. Thing that stares back at me now clearly isn't human.",

        "text": " There was one time, in the first house that i can remember living in i had frequent frights. One night, i awoke at who knows what time with one of them at the end of my bed. They were either really short, like 3 or 4 feet, or was on their knees. Pure white body, pure white clothes, pure white, spiky hair, and pitch black, empty eye sockets. It had no eyes yet i still felt that it was staring deep into my soul, it didn't do anything except just stay there, lifeless. I slowly covered myself with my blanket, trying to block the empty stare. I think i fell asleep again, and in the morning there was no trace of it or anything that i had seen, i didn't tell anyone.\n\nI was at peace for years, however just only a few years ago, in a flat/apartment that we lived in whilst i was still in primary school i had more encounters. I was woken up in the night numerous times, however these times i couldn't see whatever it is.\n\nAfter the first occasion i had lost something, my imagination. I cannot hear my thoughts, cannot dream or sleep well. Something was stolen. \n\nBack to the apartment, on one of the nights i was awoken with the sound of piano playing from very far above. However, i lived on the 10th floor of an apartment building with only 11 floors, and large instruments such as pianos were not allowed. So how was i hearing piano playing that sounded like it was beyond the roof. I only heard it once, it was calming and nice, but, i can't recall how it sounded - all i do know is that i can remember it happening. Other times i couldn't move, like i was restrained to my bed, however i was only restrained when i had my eyes open, looking for whatever it was. But the instance that i closed my eyes, stopped searching, i was free and could move. I opened my eyes again and my legs went numb. Again, I stopped looking for it and got up out of bed to enjoy my school-free weekend. \n\nEver since then i haven't had any of these encounters since then, it has been at least 3 or 4 years since i've had an event, but strange things have still been popping up, notes and reminders appear on my phone on things that you can't predict, they will sit their for months having me dread them, and then days before the set date something in my life happens that causes the reminder to come true - such as emergency doctor appointments. And thats not all, i often see humanoid shadows from the corners of my eyes. Whats even worse is that, I still haven't regained the ability to dream, sleep peacefully, hear my thoughts, and its gotten worse - my short term memory has been getting worse and worse, showing no sign of improving and things that used to fill me with joy feel empty now. It's almost like i'm slowly being turned into an empty shell.\n\nAlthough, I do not fear them, what i fear is the thought that they might go after and haunt others. It's not that my life is in danger (at least i don't think so) but that the paranoia that they cause is terrifying. Good luck to anyone who ends up running into them.",

        "text": " I’m writing this from my closet right now. I think he’s in the house.\n\nLet me explain how I even created him. This all started about a month ago. I’m not a scientist or anything, I’m a Junior in high school. I didn’t get my hands on any super advanced technology, or at least I don’t think I did. Actually, it’s my mom who got it for me. She has somewhat of a shopping addiction. It’s not what you might think though. She doesn’t obsessively buy clothes or purses; what she buys is much more random. I can’t exactly think of a specific category of items. She buys from places like thrift stores, pawn shops, flea markets and swap meets. I’m not sure which one she bought this from.\n\nShe had been gone for hours, which is normal for her. When she came back she had bags of random decorations for our already cluttered house. Not surprising. It was even less surprising when she insisted on showing off every item and asking me where to put it. As always, I wasn’t really paying attention. I mean, if I partook in this habit of hers every time she came back from a shopping spree, I’d have lost my mind by now.\n\n“I bought this one for you,” She said as she held up a battered old box. It wasn’t very big, about a foot wide and a foot long. It caught my attention.\n\n“What’s in it?” I asked as I turned off my phone. She didn’t buy things specifically for me very often since I was never really interested in any of it.\n\n“Go look,” She said as she placed it down on the kitchen counter. By the time I walked over she was already admiring something else she’d bought.\n\nWhen I opened the box, I was confused. It was an assortment of seemingly random items. An old retro alarm clock, a small plastic cylinder with a funnel attached to the top, a rusted pair of scissors, tweezers, and a syringe with a faint red stain along the interior. But what interested and confused me the most was the eight inch long glass cylinder. It seemed to be almost an inch thick, thoroughly sealing in the inky black liquid inside. I picked it up and was surprised to note that the liquid was quite warm. Tilting the bottle side to side revealed that it was rather viscous. The liquid was about two inches below the cylinder’s metal cap, leaving a bit of space. Near the top was a small line that I assumed was the fill limit. I put the cylinder back down and glanced into the box again. This time I spotted a piece of paper buried beneath the random items. Careful not to cut myself on the syringe or scissors, I pulled the paper out and was disappointed to find that it was written in a different language. It was also pretty old. It was stained a light yellow and had a few cracks and rips in it. Not ancient by any means but definitely written at least two decades ago.\n\nI dropped the paper back into the box and turned to my mom, “What is this?”\n\n“Did you see it?” She said as she analyzed a small abstract painting.\n\n“Yeah. What is it?”\n\n“It’s supposed to help you…” She got distracted by something in another one of her bags, “...make friends or something,”\n\n“Or something? How is this supposed to help me make friends?” I was getting annoyed at this point. She always pestered me about leaving the house and talking to people more often.\n\n“The man who sold it to me didn’t speak very good English,” She said as she dug through another bag, “I think he spoke Spanish or something,”\n\n“So you bought something and you don’t even know what it is?” Honestly, why was I surprised? It was just like her.\n\n“Just try it out,” She said as she waved me off.\n\nI grabbed the box and left for my room. If I stayed any longer then it would probably turn into an argument, and then she’d be passive aggressive and angry for at least a week until she spontaneously calmed down.\n\nHonestly, I put the box down in a corner of my room and forgot about it for a while. The week went by, but eventually my mom noticed. I’ll spare you the details of the conversation, but basically she was mad that I didn’t even try the gift. I decided to try it in an attempt to appease her. If I didn’t, I’d have to take the bus for a week to spare myself the uncomfortable car rides to school.\n\nSo, I cleared my desk and put down the box. The first thing I had to do was translate that paper. Not too difficult. I tried taking a picture of it, but the translation was rough so I opted for manually typing it out. To my disappointment, the paper didn’t explain what the contents of the box were meant for. It did, however, have instructions for what to do.\n\n*Follow the instructions below exactly:*\n\n*Do not spill the mixture*\n\nI assume it means the black liquid\n\n*Collect two DNA samples (Saliva, hair, teeth, blood, or urine)*\n\nThe teeth and blood concerned me. What in the world was this for?\n\n*Carefully open the container.* ***DO NOT TOUCH*** *the mixture.*\n\n*Drop the DNA samples into the mixture*\n\n*Seal completely. Shake the new mixture and let sit for forty-eight hours.* ***DO NOT TOUCH THE CONTAINER DURING THIS PERIOD.***\n\n*Collect after forty-eight hours.*\n\nI still had no clue what this would do, but I really didn’t want to deal with the school bus, so I continued. I didn’t think much would come of it.\n\nI peered into the box again to decide what DNA samples to use. I shuddered as I saw the tweezers and remembered that ‘teeth’ was an option. And the red tint inside the syringe was more concerning now. I moved them both aside and looked at the remaining options. The funnel and plastic cylinder must’ve been for the saliva and the scissors were likely for the hair. I was very thankful that there wasn’t a container for the urine sample, since it seemed like some of these had been used. While I wasn’t keen on cutting my hair, it looked like the cylinder might overflow if I added too much liquid, so saliva and hair it was.\n\nI grabbed everything I needed and headed to the bathroom. I washed out the container for saliva and, long story short, collected what I needed. Then I grabbed a lock of hair that I hoped wouldn’t be too noticeable and cut it off. Now to open the container. It actually took me a while- it was sealed *really* tight. When it finally came off, I was glad that there was a paper seal underneath, since I stumbled back and the mixture would’ve spilled. At that point I was a little nervous. The warnings were vague. I wondered what would happen if I touched it. Of course, I wasn’t going to test it out, but I was curious. Discarding the thought, I carefully peeled off the seal. I dropped my hair and saliva inside, then twisted on the cap as tight as I could. I shook the bottle and then wondered where I should put it. I decided to leave it in the cupboard under the sink so it wouldn’t get in the way.\n\nOnce everything was cleaned up I returned to my room and remembered I needed to set a timer. I could’ve used my phone, but I decided that I might as well use what was provided. After a quick Google search on how to use that old ass clock, I set it to go off in forty-eight hours. Then I cleaned everything up and told my mom. She was mostly appeased, so I carried on with my life.\n\nNothing much happened during those two days. All I did was catch a tiny cold.\n\nBut when the timer went off, I wasn’t home. I got back from Sam’s house a few hours after the alarm went off. Mom wasn’t home to turn it off, so when I opened the door, I heard it ringing from my room. Now, I got a little nervous when this happened. The note didn’t say what I had to do *after* the forty-eight hours were over.\n\nI walked to my room and turned off the alarm, then rushed to the bathroom. When I opened the cupboard, all that was left were glass shards and the metal cap. This was a confusing sight, but my best guess at the time was that the liquid had evaporated. Maybe there was a chemical reaction? It was too hot and the glass cracked? I wasn’t sure. All I did was clean up and throw away the evidence. It's not like I could’ve guessed what had *actually* happened.\n\nThe night got worse. What I thought was a cold turned into a pretty severe fever very quickly. At first it was a cough, then nausea, then fatigue. Within the hour I had thrown up three times and decided to try and sleep it off.\n\nWhen I woke up, I didn’t feel any better. I didn’t even feel well enough to call in sick for school. I’d take the absence. Took me hours to finally get out of bed and hobble my way to the kitchen to heat up some soup. My head was aching and I was pretty dizzy. I managed to get most of the soup down and tried watching TV for a while. Eventually I made my way back to my room, where I proceeded to fall asleep again. When I woke up this time, I finally felt a bit better. Still felt like throwing up, but it was slightly better. My mom was home by that point and was helping take care of me. She brought me food and medicine, so that was nice. On the fourth day, I felt well enough. Still had a bit of a headache, but it was manageable.\n\nThen Sam texted me.\n\n*Sam- ‘U ok?’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Yeah, been sick’*\n\n*Sam-’K’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U were looking weird’*\n\nI glanced around my room and wondered if he was making a weird joke.\n\n*Mike- ‘Wdym?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U had a weird look on your face’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Can you see me rn?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Saw you a few mins ago’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Shut up. Are you outside?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Yeah idiot, in the park’*\n\n*Sam- ‘U walked past me a minute ago’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Whatever. Come inside or stop being a creep.’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Wat?’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Been in my house all day. I’m sick, remember?’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Come on, just saw you, don’t lie’*\n\nAt that point I sent him a picture of me lying in bed.\n\n*Sam- ‘Wtf??? I swear that was u’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Nope’*\n\n*Sam- ‘Must’ve been a doppelganger’*\n\n*Mike- ‘Whatever you say’*\n\nThe rest of the conversation past this point is pretty irrelevant. Obviously at the time I didn’t think it was the thing that’s currently outside my house. I figured Mike saw someone that looked like me and got confused. In hindsight, I know that’s not the case.\n\nI saw the truth the next day. My mom had left for work and I was feeling pretty good. I got out of bed to go use the bathroom. When I looked through the doorway, I screamed. I hadn’t even realized that he looked exactly like me, I was just freaked out that there was another person in the house. But as I stared at him, I noticed that he was my spitting image. My brown hair, my hazel eyes, my pale complexion, my height. Everything. The only thing different about him was his clothes. An old pair of jeans I hadn’t worn in a while and the gray sweater I got last year.\n\nI was frozen. He wasn’t looking at me though, he was looking in the mirror, analyzing his face. *My* face. Slowly, he turned his head. It’s a strange sensation, seeing your own eyes looking back at you. But this thing, there was no emotion on his face. If eyes are the window to the soul, then he doesn’t have one. When he took a step towards me I bolted to my room and slammed the door behind me, being very sure to lock it. My heart was racing and I think I was starting to hyperventilate. Really, it’s all a blur of panic. I’d never had a panic attack before, but I think that’s the closest I ever got. My mind was still trying to grapple with what I had seen, so it took me a while to start searching for my phone. My hands shook as I sifted through the blankets on my bed, trying to see where I’d left it. I screamed again when someone knocked on my door. By then I just ripped the blankets off my bed but still couldn’t find it.\n\n“Michael,” My muffled voice said from the other side of the door. It was monotone and just sounded wrong.\n\nI checked my nightstand and it wasn’t there either. My legs were weak and I felt like crying. I couldn’t find my phone anywhere. Another knock came from the door. I frantically searched the room for any exit, my eyes landing on the window.\n\n“Is there something wrong?” He asked with no concern or confusion in his voice. I probably should’ve been a bit quieter, but I was in a panic. I ran for the window and fumbled with the latch. Another knock at the door. I pulled on the handle, not remembering which way it was to unlock it. When the latch finally clicked, I shoved the window open and was outside in seconds. After that I just started running. All I knew was that I needed help. In my panic, I passed by multiple people who seemed a little concerned, but I didn’t think to ask them. My adrenaline rush carried me the three blocks over to Sam’s house.\n\nI told him about everything and he called the cops for me as I tried to calm down. I’m not sure whether he believed me or not, but he definitely was concerned. We made our way back to my house where the cops had already arrived. Nobody was found inside and there were no signs of forced entry. The officer taking our statements seemed annoyed and indirectly told us off. ‘Calling the police is serious’ and stuff like that. My mom was called, and needless to say, she wasn’t too pleased.\n\nAt first she was a little concerned, but our conversation turned into an argument. I told her about who I saw and she thought that I’d made the whole thing up. She complained about having to leave her job early and how she couldn’t afford to do that. Needless to say, the conversation got ugly. I’m not all that proud of how I handled it, but at a certain point I brought up how much money she spent because of her shopping addiction. We got into some personal stuff and by the end of it I was grounded. I made sure to lock my door and window before going to bed that night.\n\nFriday came and went. It was hard to focus as I spent the whole day looking out for whoever I’d seen. By the time school was over, I was feeling pretty unsure of myself. My brain started coming up with excuses. Maybe my fever had been worse than I thought. Maybe I had been really tired. I didn’t know. The police didn’t find anything and it *did* sound really weird. I think anyone’s brain would’ve started making excuses by then. Don’t worry though, I saw him again and all my theories were disproved.\n\nMy mom soon left to visit family. I decided to skip the trip both due to the car ride and to avoid my mother complaining to my family members about me in my face. Since I was still grounded, she took my phone with her. It had been a while since the incident, and while it still creeped me out, my brain had finally convinced me that I was mistaken. It was the afternoon and I had to go to the bathroom. When I looked through the doorway, there he was again. I think I caught him practicing how to smile because when he turned to me, he wore a horrifying grin.\n\n“Jesus- fuck-” I stumbled back into the wall, then turned and ran for the kitchen. I didn’t hear him follow me but I grabbed a knife anyway. When I turned around, there he was, expressionless once again.\n\nHe looked down at the knife and cocked his head to the side, “I don’t understand your concern,”\n\nMy hands were shaky as I tried to compose myself, which was hard to do when I was looking at proof that this thing was real, “Who… the fuck… are you…” I said as I backed away from him. I was really trying to control my breathing.\n\nHe looked back up at me, “Do you not remember?”\n\nI didn’t respond. I was too busy trying to find a way to get away from him. Running around the kitchen island and for the front door might’ve worked, but I wasn’t sure how fast he was. What if he caught me? What would he do? The question was enough to keep me where I was.\n\nHe interrupted my thoughts, “You saw me five days ago,”\n\n“No shit,”\n\nI hadn’t seen him blink once that entire time, “You created me seven days ago,”\n\nNow confusion entered the mix of fear and desperation I was feeling. I had no clue what he was talking about. He said nothing else, so I tried thinking about what he was referring to. What was I doing seven days ago? The only thing I could think of that was out of the ordinary was the weird gift my mom gave me. How the fuck would that create *him*?\n\n“To my understanding, you are,” He analyzed my face for a moment, “Fearful,”\n\n“What the fuck do you want?” I said as I took a tentative step sideways around the kitchen island. He didn’t move, though his gaze followed me. Then the doorbell rang. I jumped and looked towards the door, then looked back at him. Except, he was gone. I spun around but didn’t see him everywhere, “Fuck!” I sprinted towards the door and flung it open, rushing past Sam.\n\nI can’t remember much else about that day. I spent it looking over my shoulder and trying to grasp what I’d seen. I told Sam about everything, and he tried his best to help. He let me stay at his house that night, since I was too anxious in my own, and didn’t dismiss what I was saying. After having told him everything, I was pretty quiet. He didn’t pry, but he was researching something on his computer for most of the day. And things didn’t get much better after that.\n\nI didn’t see him for a few days. I was staying at Sam’s during that time in the spare room. His little brother Bobby was loud, but it was better than being alone at my own house. Sam told his mom that I wasn’t feeling safe and she accepted that. She was certainly more empathetic than my own mother. Sam and I talked about what could be happening. He passively mentioned the possibility that who I saw may not have been real, but dismissed it when he saw that I was certain. We eventually came to the conclusion that it must’ve been related to my mom’s gift. We didn’t know how it worked, but the fact that it needed my DNA was suspicious.\n\nI was constantly on edge after the incident. I tried to relax, but I felt uneasy around the windows. It felt like I was being watched. Sam said that it was probably paranoia, but I think he could feel it too. He seemed slightly more jumpy, more on edge. Thankfully his mother and brother seemed to be pretty unbothered, though I saw Ms. Watson sage the house one night. From what Sam had told me in the past, that was supposed to ward off negative energy. I didn’t believe in the supernatural, but I hoped that if it were real that the sage would do something.\n\nBobby was only six years old. I cared about him, but he could certainly be annoying sometimes. He stayed up past his bedtime running around his room and loudly listening to YouTube videos. The walls were pretty thin, so I could hear him all night.\n\n“How does he have so much energy when he never sleeps?” I asked Sam one day as we were watching something in the living room. We could hear him laughing down the hall.\n\n“I ask myself that question every day,”\n\n“How do you get to bed?”\n\nSam took in a deep breath, “You get used to it eventually,”\n\nI uncomfortably glanced out the window as the sun began to go down. I was mentally getting ready to go to bed. Once it got dark, it was really hard to sleep. The stillness outside my window was occasionally broken by the wind or the rustling of the leaves outside. Any noise made me jump. We watched TV for a while longer before I left for my room. As I did every night, I checked and double checked every corner of the room. Under the bed, in the closet, and outside the window. Then I drew the curtains to be safe. Once I was ready, I got into bed and tried my best to block out Bobby.\n\nThat night I actually slept quite well. I would’ve liked to believe that it was me getting used to the background noise, but I know that’s not what happened. Bobby was quieter that night, but I hadn’t really noticed. After the second night of getting good sleep, I wondered if Ms. Watson had spoken to Bobby about being quieter. On the third night is when I noticed something was wrong.\n\nI fell asleep for a while, but I was awoken by Bobby’s giggling. Not uncommon. I rolled over in bed and tried to go back to sleep. Once again Bobby was talking to his tablet as if the YouTubers he watched could hear him. This went on for twenty minutes before I noticed that I hadn’t heard any music. Every night, I heard the annoying songs the YouTubers he watched played for every intro and outro. But I hadn't heard any. This made me sit up. As I listened closer, I could hear another voice. A familiar voice. Ice ran through my veins. It couldn’t be. Bobby giggled again. I pressed my ear against the wall and strained to listen. They were speaking very quietly, and I really wanted to believe that it was a video. But in all of the video’s Bobby watched, the YouTubers were just as loud as he normally was. I took a deep breath and willed myself to get out of bed, really *really* hoping I was mistaken. But if I wasn’t, I couldn’t leave Bobby in there alone. I tried my best to make sure the bed didn’t squeak and silently made my way across the room. Creaking my door open as gently as possible, I tried to look down the dark hall. The only light visible came from underneath Bobby’s door. I stood frozen as I hoped for the best. Taking my first step out of the room, it seemed like the air around me changed. It was so still. Carefully, I made my way down the hall, trying to listen to the voices over my beating heart. The sound of my feet against the wooden floors seemed so loud in the near silence. Only three feet away from Bobby’s door, I was certain. It was *him*. I was scared, but also mad. It was one thing to torment me, but he had followed me here. He was doing god knows what with Bobby, who had nothing to do with the situation. I knew I should probably grab a weapon, but as I stepped in front of Bobby’s door, the voices stopped. I felt so vulnerable. In the middle of a pitch black hall, I didn’t know what this thing was, what it wanted, or what it would do when I opened the door.\n\nSwallowing the lump in my throat, I opened my mouth, “Bobby?” I called out, though it came out quieter than I had intended. I heard a little giggle from inside. Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the handle and swung the door open.\n\nBobby was sitting on the ground. His face was turned to me, but his body was facing the other direction. Facing towards his open window. And when he saw me, he clapped, “How did you do that?!”\n\n“What?” I asked, my voice wavering. I looked around his room. He was the only person in there, but his tablet was charging on his bed.\n\n“Do it again!”\n\nI stepped into his room and checked behind the door, then looked back at him. He was still smiling, his eyes full of amazement. I looked at the window again, then crossed the room and slammed it shut, being sure to lock it, “Who were you talking to?” I asked as I looked outside.\n\nI already knew the answer, “You!” Bobby giggled.\n\nI didn’t know what to say. How could I explain this to him? Now I didn’t *feel* like I was being watched, I knew I was being watched. I didn’t know where he was, but he was watching me. I took Bobby and rushed over to Sam’s room, then rapped on the door until he opened.\n\n“*What?*” He asked, clearly irritated,\n\n“We need to talk,” I said as I looked around.\n\n“Right now?”\n\n“Yes, now,”\n\nHe must’ve seen how panicked I was, because he let me and Bobby in, “What happened?” He asked with a bit more concern.\n\nI sent Bobby to sit on Sam’s bed while we spoke, “He was here,”\n\nIt took him a moment to realize what I was saying, “What?”\n\n“He was talking to Bobby,”\n\nSam stood there, shocked. He shook his head, then rushed over to his little brother, “Are you okay? What happened?”\n\nBobby was confused, as he’d realized we were upset, “Me and Mike were talking for a while,”\n\n“About what?” Sam pressed him to continue.\n\nBobby shrugged, “I don’t know, he told me to be quieter. Then he did a magic trick by leaving through the window and coming back in through the door,” Bobby looked at me for confirmation, but I was too busy trying not to panic.\n\nSam rubbed his hand over his face and thought for a moment, “Okay… don’t do that again,” Bobby furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, “That was… that was someone doing a magic trick to look like Mike. Don’t talk to them. Lock your doors and windows.”\n\nBobby seemed rightfully scared but agreed to not talk to them again. Sam and I spent a while trying to calm him down, but eventually he only agreed to sleep in Sam’s room for the night. When I went back to bed that night, I was certain I could hear footsteps outside. The next day Sam and I contemplated telling his mom, but decided against it. Yes, we know now that was a mistake. But at the time we were scared she would react as my mom did. As well, Sam was scared that she might kick me out. Now, obviously I was scared of that as well, but I also felt bad for putting Sam and his family in danger. Still, he insisted that we try and wait it out. We spent the rest of that day brainstorming what it could want and how to make it go away. At this point, Sam fully believed me. In the end, we had no clue. If I had created it, I didn’t create it for any certain purpose. We didn’t know what it was trying to do. By the end of the day, we gave up and prepared for the night.\n\nI could hear the footsteps for a while. I’d say they went on for about an hour before suddenly coming to a halt. I didn’t know why, until there was a knock at my window. Nothing too loud, but it made my breath catch in my throat. I kept my eyes shut and waited for it to go away, but it never did. Every minute, there was a knock. It came periodically for thirty minutes before I got out of bed and walked over to the window. Despite the fact that I knew what I was going to see, I still stumbled back when I drew the curtains apart. There he was again. He was just about to knock again but put his arm back down when he saw me. I was waiting for him to do something, but he didn't. He just stood there, staring at me. It was just as unsettling as last time.\n\nFinally, I mustered up the courage to speak, “What the fuck do you want?”\n\nAt that he cocked his head to the side but did not respond.\n\n“What do you want?!” I was getting angry. It's exhausting living weeks in a state of fear, and here he was just staring at me. But even so, he didn’t respond, “Why are you here?!”\n\nFinally, it spoke, “For whatever purpose you need,” Its muffled voice came through the window, sending chills down my spine. It’s voice was no longer so monotone and sounded a lot more like mine.\n\n“I don’t need you for anything. Why are you here?”\n\n“I was created to serve whatever purpose you need,” It’s really creepy seeing my voice come from my emotionless face right in front of me.\n\n“I didn’t even want you! You were an accident because my goddamn mom bought that stupid box on a whim!” As I stared at it, it remained stone faced, “You want to help? Go! Leave me alone! Get rid of yourself! I don’t want you!”\n\nIt didn’t respond. After an awkward moment of silent staring, I closed the curtains. I didn’t go to bed that night, though I didn’t really try to. I stayed up, making sure that it didn’t try to enter my room. I didn’t hear any more footsteps, but when I opened the curtains in the morning, it was gone. I told Sam about it when he woke up. Neither of us felt watched anymore, though we were still on edge. We didn’t know what it was going to do with those instructions. I was really hoping it *would* get rid of itself. Two days later Ms. Watson told me that my mom was heading back home. She would be back by five, so she offered to drive me home. When it was time, we pulled up to the driveway but didn’t see her car. I assumed it was in the garage, said bye and went inside. My mom was already in her room, but she left my phone on the kitchen counter. I checked the house to make sure *he* wasn’t hiding anywhere, then went back to my room. My mom didn’t try to talk to me, so I supposed she was still upset, but I didn’t really care. I was mad at her as well. She got me into this damn situation, then left while I had to deal with it.\n\nMy life was pretty normal for a few days. I was still checking over my shoulder, but I didn’t see him again. I took the bus to school since mom was still ignoring me. We didn’t talk or even see each other for a few days. Then my aunt texted me.\n\n*Sheryl- Hey sweetie, can you tell your mom to call me back? She hasn’t been responding to me. Thanks!*\n\nI said yes and begrudgingly left my room, approaching my mom’s door. I knocked but got no response, “Mom?” I rolled my eyes. Either she was ignoring me or she had fallen asleep with the TV on. I knocked again and called out, but still got no response. I texted my aunt and told her my mom was asleep. Now, if I’m telling you about this then you know something’s wrong. And it was, but I didn’t know it at the time. By the seventh day of her ignoring me, I was starting to get weirded out. I hadn’t heard her leave her room, cook, or take anything from the fridge. I texted Sam and he immediately told me to check her room. So, I walked over, knocking just to be sure. When she didn’t answer, I swung open the door and was met with an empty room. My heart began to race, but I checked the garage before panicking. No car. Okay, maybe she wasn’t home. I texted her to ask where she was and thankfully received a response.\n\n*Mom- Getting groceries. I’m just down the street.*\n\nI sighed in relief and felt a little dumb. I walked outside and waited for her. Being scared that something had happened to her made me want to forget the whole argument we were having. And really, I was still coming down from the anxiety and needed to see that she was actually okay. After a few minutes of waiting outside, I saw her car turn the corner. I sighed out of relief and walked over to the sidewalk. The car rolled down the street, but as it did, I noticed that the front was dented. Had she gotten in a car accident? Since I was studying the damage on the car, I didn’t notice that she had sped up. Now the car was barreling down the street towards the house. Actually, I noticed, it was coming towards me. By the time I realized this I barely had enough time to jump out of the way before the car drove right over where I had been standing. There was a loud crack behind me as the mailbox was run over. I stared flabbergasted at the car as it continued down the street. Even after it disappeared around the corner, I stayed on the ground, my heart racing.\n\nWhat shook me out of it was when my phone rang. My hands shaking with adrenaline, I pulled it out of my pocket and glanced at the screen. It was my mom. I answered the call and held the phone to my ear. I could hear the sound of her driving in the background, but she didn’t say anything.\n\n“Hello?” I finally said, my voice a mix of annoyance and fear.\n\nThere was silence for a moment before my voice came through the phone, “You were an accident because my goddamn mom bought that stupid box on a whim!”\n\nI froze. It sounded exactly the same as when I had said it just a few days ago, “What the fuck…” He didn’t say anything else, “Where is my mom?!”\n\nHe didn’t respond. Instead, he ended the call. I stared down the street for a while before eventually getting up and rushing back inside. Obviously I considered calling the police, but what was I supposed to say? My clone tried to run me over and may have killed my mom? No. It took me a while to calm myself, but eventually I managed to think of a plan. I called my family to ensure they hadn’t seen her, which caused my aunt to panic. She was already in her car when she called to say she was staying with me until my mom was found. I had no objection and told her what I could when she said she was filing a missing persons report. I had to be selective about what I told her. I ended up saying that I hadn’t seen her since she left but that I saw her car, which looked dented and damaged. I was anxious and hoping that my mom was okay, but it definitely felt better knowing that there were people looking for her. And that I wouldn’t be alone. The only issue is that my aunt lived far away and I would be alone for the rest of the day.\n\nBy then it was late in the afternoon and the sun was starting to go down. I considered going to Sam’s place, but it was getting dark and I was scared that I would lead whoever or whatever this person is to them. Clearly he had become violent. I called Sam and told him what happened, and he told me to stay over until my aunt arrived. I wanted to, but by that point it was dark out and I felt like I was being watched again. Sam kept telling me to head to his house, but I didn’t feel safe going outside. I knew it was out there. I could hear it walking around.\n\nThen came the knock at the door, causing me to jump. My aunt wasn’t supposed to be here for another few hours. I checked through the peephole and didn’t see anyone. I grabbed a knife and drew the curtains, but I can still hear him walking around. My aunt will be here soon so I’m hoping he’ll go away once she arrives. But I’m also scared that he might hurt her. I can’t call her and say ‘there’s a clone of me that might hurt you,’ so I’m trying to figure out what to do. I’m hiding in my closet just to be safe, but I’m really hoping he doesn’t get inside. I wrote this out in case I get killed before my aunt arrives. If anyone knows what this thing is or how I can get rid of him, please help me. The knocking is getting louder and I think he’s trying to break the door down.",

        "text": "Rules to wash your face.\n\n\nHad a fun day? \n\nIt's night time and you are not supposed to sleep with that makeup and dirt on. It doesn't like a dirty face.\n\n Wanna use makeup wipes? No you can't. Make up wipes aren't enough. You NEED to wash your face using soap and water. Don't forget to take that towel with you. \n\n\nHere are some rules to wash your face at night. You better do it right.\n\n\n1.  Enter your washroom at exactly 10:10pm. Before or after 10:10pm is not allowed.\n\n\n2.  DON'T LOOK AT MIRROR. The one staring back isn't you. \n\n  2a. If you accidentally look at the mirror. DON'T PANIC. Act like everything is normal and keep washing your face like normal.\n\n2b. It may not look like you. Most of the time it wouldn't. Act normal. Don't try to scream or look scared. It feeds on your reaction.\n\n\n3. Always use soap or face wash or anything you normally use.\n\n\n4. Wash your face twice. Use that soap twice. Lather that soap on your hand before applying it to your face. It doesn't like odd numbers.\n\n\n5. Don't forget to turn your tap off while using soap. It doesn't like people who waste water.\n\n\n6. If you hear something tapping. IGNORE IT. It's coming from glass. It wants to distract you.\n\n\n7. If you hear screaming or crying while your eyes are closed. Open your eyes immediately doesn't matter if it burns. Keep your eyes open for 5 seconds. \n\n\n8. Wash your face with water. It may look like blood but it's water. Don't react.\n\n\n9. Repeat the process all over again. Use soap, lather it, put it on your face and wash with water. ( You may again hear those screaming and crying. Open your eyes for 5 seconds)\n\n\n10. DON'T FORGET THE TOWEL. Dry your face and hands in front of the mirror. If you looked at the mirror. Keep staring at it and continue.\n\n\n11. Try to be as casual as you can.\n\n\n12. Get out from there as fast as possible after completing.\n\n\n13. DON'T FORGET TO CLOSE THE DOORS.\n\n\n14. You may hear noises. IGNORE it. It just wants you to enter again.\n\n\n15. Go to your room. .\n\n\n16. DON'T GO TO YOUR BED. And don't look at any mirror. It can travel from a mirror to the real world.\n\n\n17. wait until the noises from your washroom stop. \n\n 17a. If it doesn't stop after 10 mins get out from the house. You probably did something wrong.\n\n17b. If it doesn't stop after 30 mins. Block the washroom door. It's trying to escape from the mirror.\n\n\n18. It'll stop within 5 minutes if everything is right.\n\n\n19. After it stops. Go to bed and sleep.\n\n\nDon't forget any of these rules. It's extremely important to obey all the rules. It loves a clean and dry face.  Dirty face, odd numbers and waste of water are more than enough to make it extremely angry. Don't react. It feeds on your reaction and get stronger every time.\n\nHave a goodnight.\n\nOr not.",

        "text": "It was a dark and rainy night. I was settled in for the evening, scrolling through my phone and trying to unwind after a long day. I had just finished up a long shift at work and was looking forward to a quiet night in, maybe catching up on some TV or reading a good book. But as I sat there in the comfortable glow of my living room, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.\n\nI couldn't quite put my finger on what was causing the sense of unease, but I couldn't shake it. It was like a sixth sense, a feeling that something was about to happen. And then, just as I was starting to get really freaked out, I heard a noise outside my window.\n\nIt was a faint sound at first, barely perceptible over the sound of the rain and the howling wind. But as I listened more closely, I realized that it was the sound of footsteps, approaching my window. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that someone was out there, walking up to my house in the dead of night.\n\nI had no idea who it could be, or what they wanted. All I knew was that I was terrified, and I had to find out what was going on. So, with a trembling hand, I reached out and pulled back the curtains, peering out into the darkness.\n\nAt first, I couldn't see anything. It was pitch black outside, and the rain was coming down in sheets, making it nearly impossible to see more than a few feet in front of me. But then, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw a figure standing there, clad in a long, flowing black robe and wearing a creepy, featureless white mask.\n\nI couldn't see their eyes through the slits in the mask, but I could feel their gaze upon me, as if they were staring right through me. It was a feeling of intense, almost palpable fear, like something was lurking just beyond the veil of reality, waiting to snatch me up and Roz]: carry me away to some unknown and terrifying place. I was frozen in place, too terrified to move or even speak. I could feel the blood pounding in my veins, my heart racing as I tried to make sense of what was happening.\n\nWho was this figure, standing there in the rain and watching me through the window? What did they want from me? And why were they wearing that strange, unsettling mask? I had a million questions running through my head, but no answers.\n\nI don't know how long we stood there, locked in that intense and terrifying gaze. It could have been seconds, or it could have been hours. All I knew was that I was trapped in that moment, unable to move or speak as the figure continued to watch me.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the figure turned and vanished into the night, disappearing into the darkness and the rain. I was left alone and shaken, my mind racing as I tried to understand what had just happened.\n\nI never saw the figure again, but I still think about that night all the time. Who was that mysterious figure in the mask, and what did they want from me? I can't help but wonder if they were some kind of supernatural being, or just a deeply disturbed individual with a twisted sense of fun.\n\nEither way, I don't think I'll ever forget the feeling of being watched by that eerie, faceless presence. I really hope it doesn’t come back…",

        "text": "I’m an early 2000s baby, so I mainly had a childhood by the late 2000s and early 2010s. My momma always bought my older siblings and I DVDs and one of my favorites was Strawberry Shortcake from 2003. Growing up, I loved cartoons and still do as a young adult. \n\nI was home one night while my third older brother was in his room playing video games on his new gaming PC. For reference, my house is one floor with a kitchen, dining room, living room, one bathroom, and three bedrooms. The living room has a new upgraded smart TV, so an old DVD player wouldn’t work with it. I decided to go into my parents’ room because they still had their old DVD player and small TV with antennas.\n\nMy parents’ room is two doors away from my brothers’ room, so I was close. By how my brother likes to play his games, he has a headset, so he wouldn’t be interrupted if my DVD was loud.\n\nI headed into the bedroom and looked at the shelves where the DVDs were neatly kept. I scanned for a few seconds and decided to pick out my favorite DVD of Strawberry Shortcake. It was a little dusty after not being played for so long, so I just lightly brushed my hand over the packaging. I plopped that sucker into the DVD player after turning on the TV. Thinking of that childhood nostalgia, I decided it was best to cook up some popcorn while the theme song was playing. I jammed out to it for a moment before stepping outside of the room. Of course, I cooked the popcorn in the microwave for about a minute and a half.\n\nAfter pouring the fresh microwave popcorn into a bowl and spreading Valentina sauce over it with a few squeezes lime, I returned to my parents’ room. I looked at the main menu to scan for specific episodes I wanted to see and my eyes blinked for a split second. I saw an episode title I’ve never seen before.\n\nNow, I’ve got a collection of DVDs of the Strawberry Shortcake series with every episode from every season and I’ve watched all of them multiple times when I was a kid. Enough to annoy the fuck out of my brothers whenever the cartoon was on. However, this titled was called, “Blueberry’s Sorrow Show”. Blueberry Muffin was my favorite character in this show because she had pretty wavy hair and blue was my favorite color.\n\nI put a handful of popcorn in my mouth before clicking on that episode out of curiosity. That, my friends, would be the worst mistake of my entire damn life.\n\nThe theme song was the same and I couldn’t tell anything was wrong until the title screen came. The outside was a sky view of some scary-looking branches that seemed to be from the forest surrounding Blueberry Muffin’s home. Well, her debut episode was spooky for fun, but these backgrounds looked like they were from Ellen and Edgar or some Tim Burton film. Regardless, I kept munching on popcorn and carried on watching.\n\nThe camera zoomed in on Blueberry’s house and the inside of her house. The main room was a mess. The bookshelves were knocked over with books scattered across the floor, pillows from a couch were torn open and feathers stood from them. My eyes ran around to look at the scene to see some bones nearby. The camera turned to the left to show Cheesecake, Blueberry’s pet mouse, on his back gasping for air. The mouse seemed to have fallen on his back and was probably in his last moments judging by the menacing shadow looming over him. I heard very disturbing laughter and I stopped eating when I realized what was going on.\n\nBlueberry Muffin herself was holding a hammer and her cheek was covered in a small spot of blood. Her hair was tangled, her clothes were torn, and she had a crazed look on her face. She laughed while bending down to her knees and looked at her dying pet.\n\n“You thought you could save them, huh?” she asked him before the camera focused on her grip on the hammer. \n\nSlowly, she raised her hammer in the air and began to violently hit her mouse with it. I recoiled in place as blood and guts flew around and Blueberry’s crazy laughter increased in volume. When she was done, her face was covered in Cheesecake’s blood. She sighed before getting up and leaving her house.\n\nI wish I could have just saved myself more of the trauma, but for some jacked up reason, I chose to keep watching.\n\nBlueberry had been hiking in the forest and it showed her path going up a trail and it soon led to a mountain and a cliff. The screen focused on her crazed expression and heavy breathing for what felt like forever. Her breathing finally melted into intense sobbing and tears began to fall. The girl was mumbling and I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but I heard “why can’t I keep my friends alive?” escape her sob.\n\nAfter some time, she finally stood up and reached her arms in a T-pose. The camera focused on her from behind and she stood for a second before falling forward off the cliff. The DVD stopped and scratched before I ejected the disc from the player and the disc was horribly destroyed and burning hot to the touch.\n\nI sat on the bed almost bursting in tears at what the hell I just saw. For months I never told anyone what I saw, but I trashed that DVD and the others of that series. I don’t know how I can handle shit like Saw or House of 1000 Corpses, but I can’t stand to see my favorite childhood cartoon become morbid out of nowhere.",

        "text": "Me and my wife Cecilia have been married happily for almost 18 years now, and she never showed any signs of sadness in our relationship. Earlier while she was at work, I was looking through her computer to find a recipe of her grandmothers. While looking, I came across a folder of documents titled “recipes”. Obviously it was what I was looking for, so I clicked on it. Big mistake. It was full (and I mean FULL) of untitled documents. I felt too lazy to look through them all for a recipe, so I gave up. Until something caught my eye. One document with a title, a very short one. I read “what to do with the body”. I froze. Confusion and fear entering my body, I shakily double clicked on the file. The first sentence in the doc said word for word “I will hide the body under the flowers in the garden at 12, that way all of the neighbors will have gone to work.” Who was she going to kill? The document went on and on about how she was going to bury this person under the roses in the back garden, then pick the flowers and plant new ones. After that, she was going to file a missing persons case, and tell people she was shopping during the time. Shaken, I clicked off the document and scrolled all way down to the first doc and opened it. The first few words were “I will kill Dan with poison in his lunch, which he will eat around 11:30, it will take full affect in about 25 minutes.” I couldn’t believe my eyes. Dan. My name. My mind was rushing. Cilia couldn’t have written this. She wouldn’t. A wave of relief rushed over me reading the date of the last edit. 3 years ago. Maybe she’d changed her mind. I scrolled to the latest document and opened it. I was immediately submerged in fear again when I saw the date on this one. 2 hours ago. She’d been planning my death for 3 years, maybe longer. I read through the doc, wanting to cry the whole time. It was explaining what she’d tell the police in detail. Just as i’d finished reading, my phone buzzed. A message from Cecilia. “I’m on my way back from Whole Foods with your lunch, also I thought I’d take the rest of the day off of work so we could spend time together ❤️❤️.” I immediately texted back. “No need! I’m making one of your grandma’s recipes right now, the roasted potatoes!” She left me on read. My mind was racing. I didn’t know if I should report it to the police, or pretend I’d never read it and make the food. I took the time I had left to skim through some of the documents and think about what to do. Lots of them were what she would tell my different relatives and my kids. Oh god the kids. How would they feel if they found out? Was she thinking of hurting them too? I’m extremely conflicted on what to think and do. She’s not home yet, and I’m sitting here practically in tears. If I don’t update…you know what happened.",
