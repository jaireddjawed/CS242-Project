        "text": "Yay! I don't get to post topics often here because most stuff is either so glaringly wrong others beat me to it or so obscure I would never have thought about it. And it's so rare to get proper Austrian badhistory that I really couldn't let this chance pass. \n\nSo apparently Extra Credits has started a series on WWI called *Extra History - World War I: The Seminal Tragedy*. So far there's three videos up:\n\n- [Chapter 1: The Concert of Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-wSL4WqUws&amp;list=UUCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg)   \n- [Chapter 2: One Fateful Day in June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyCmh9G1fpo&amp;list=UUCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg)   \n- [Chapter 3: The July Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zroZqvr4whk&amp;list=UUCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg)   \n\nFor now, I'm going to focus mainly on the second video about Sarajevo, mainly because I've already done a post about it [over in AskHistorians](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2hvln8/a_popular_new_history_series_on_youtube_extra/) where I originally got it from. (Side note: do we still need to np the AH sub for the bot or is it on the list? Done anyway for safety.)\n\nThe video itself isn't too bad for a bunch of people that normally do gaming topics, but for dramatic reasons it also is a very gripping tale of revenge, struggle for freedom and of course craaazy coincidences, apparently set in a *slightly* different parallel universe. Either that or they used an incredible mix of accurate sources and random guesses.\n\nWe'll start after the whole setup that reads more like the script to Ocean's Eleven...\n\nEDIT: Except for this:\n\n&gt; The curtain opens on the back of a run-down cafe in Belgrade. (0:10)\n\nGavrilo Princip and his mates were Bosnians, Sarajevo locals. They would not have met in Belgrade, Serbia, when they came up with the plan and while Princip, Grabez and Čabrinović did indeed go to Serbia beforehand to train in the Black Hand's secret academy they only came into contact with that group after the initial decision to kill.\n\n&gt; [Franz Ferdinand &amp; Sophie]'ve come to Sarajevo to watch military maneuvers, but really that's an excuse. It's their anniversary. They've come to get away from the stifling courts of Austria, where the Archduke's marriage to Sophie will never be accepted due to her low birth. She was, after all, only a countess. (1:04)\n\n\"Watch military maneuvers\" sounds a bit tourist-y for Franz Ferdinand. After all, he *was* General Inspector of the Armed Forces and thus de-facto highest military officer of the country, come to inspect a big maneuver as part of his monumental plan to overhaul the whole Austro-Hungarian military. \n\nSophie also was not \"just a countess\". She was in fact the daughter of *Boguslaw Chotek von Chotkow und Wognin*, governour of the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg and descendant of ancient Bohemian aristocracy. Low aristocracy though, the family had barons at best and a \"von\" at worst. Not in any way suited for inner Habsburg circles anyway.  \nIt's a great love story though, Franz Ferdinand fell in love with Sophie against all orders and continued to defy both his father and the Emperor until he was eventually granted the marriage to her in a ceremony that wasn't attended even by the groom's own brother. Because she was too low for the family she was elevated to \"Duchess of Hohenberg\" first by Franz Joseph under the condition that their marriage be morganatic, meaning Sophie and all her children with the Archduke would not have any claim on her husband's titles or, god forbid, the throne.\n\n&gt; Now, perhaps the Archduke had chosen that day [June 28] to show solidarity, to ease tension, to make the people of Serbia understand that he cared about their traditions. maybe he simply didn't know that the day had any special importance. (1:48)\n\nProbably just for drama and comedy, but the Slavic population of Austria had celebrated Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day) for a long time. Including the big Sokol (a Slavic youth sport movement) event held every year on that day in Bratislava. The Empire was very much aware of the day's connotations with the Slavs.\n\nAlso notable to say that the (first) Battle of Kosovo Field was not just Serbs but also featured troops of King Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who was the only one to respond to Serbia's plea for a coalition. And contrary to Serbia the Bosnian troops actually managed to leave the battlefield relatively unharmed while Serbia was devastated (even at high cost to the Ottomans) and Bosnia managed to stay independent much better than Serbia, which was integrated not long after.\nSo the date would be no less memorable to Bosnia and not necessarily a nod to Serbia herself.\n\n&gt; They call themselves \"Young Serbia\". (2:49)\n\nUm... no, they don't. They call themselves \"Young Bosnia\" (Mladna Bosna). Pretty important as they were all inhabitants of Bosnia who may have founded their little club with the intent of uniting the Slavs under Serbia but at that point had no association with any Serbian agents.\n\n&gt; [...] an assassin steps forward and throws a bomb at the Archduke's car. Seconds before it lands, Ferdinand sees it and dives behind the doors of the car. The bomb passes over him and bounces into the street behind. (3:45)\n\nThis is all very dramatic, but the grenade actually landed in front of the car so as to explode under it. The important person here is the driver, Leopold Lojka, who quickly sped up enough to pass over it. Further, I am slightly annoyed that the car only features Franz Ferdinand and Sophie... the front passenger seat was occupied by adjutant Gustav Schneiberg, and opposite of the pair on folding chairs sat Oskar Potiorek, governour of Bosnia-Herzegovina and chaimberlain Count Franz von Harrach, whose car and driver it actually was (not \"the Archdukes personal chauffeur\", as claimed later).\n\nShortly after, the story of Nedjelko Čabrinović and his unlucky suicide attempts are true, but I think it's worth pointing out that they didn't buy \"cheap cyanide\" but were furnished with expired one by their Serbian contacts. Shame they didn't have EU guidelines back then.\n\n&gt; [...] and so, as they're making their way through Sarajevo, the Archduke's driver makes a wrong turn onto Franz-Joseph-Street, a street named for the Archduke's father. (5:55)\n\nThis is bad... the obvious thing here is that Franz Ferdinand's father is actually Archduke Karl Ludwig, Franz Joseph's younger brother. This due to the fact that the Emperor's only son and heir, Rudolf, had shot himself in a suicide pact with his mistress, the Baroness Mary Vetsera, in early 1889. Others may want to tell you it was all an elegant assassination, but don't listen to those loonies.\n\nAnd the route Lojka took was not so much \"a random wrong turn\" but the proper planned parade route. It was just that the plan to go to the Konak and visit the wounded from his convoy would have meant for the cars to stay on Appel Quay and turn left into the city at some point instead of right over Cumurija bridge. Count Potiorek reacted too late with his directions though.\n\nAnd finally, I'm sure /u/cordis_melum would have a lot to say [about the depiction of the sandwich](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2frp4r/did_princip_just_get_lucky_when_he_assassinated/).\n\n&gt; He [Princip] pulls out his pistol, and he fires two shots that changed the world. (6:43)\n\nThe following sequence is pretty much all drama.\n\nA more accurate representation: \n\nPrincip fires once, aiming to hit Potiorek, who in his position is at least equally hated by the group as an oppressive figure as the Archduke is, but his bullet hits the door and ricochets into the Empress Sophie's abdomen, which almost instantly knocks her out if not kills her outright then and there. Franz Ferdinand spins around and cries the words from the video almost exactly, except that he calls her \"Sopherl\", the diminuitive. Only in this turned position does the second shot hit him in the neck, piercing his trachea and severing his jugular vein.\nBy now the population around has finally reacted, piling themselves on top of Gavrilo Princip and savagely beating him until the police manage to get him out alive for questioning. Count Harrach (not \"a random guy\") is the one to address the Archduke and receive the \"it's nothing\".\n\nThere is in no way any less drama than the version by the guys of Extra Credits and yet they chose to completely ignore key passengers in the car for no reason.\n\nThat neither of them live through the hour is correct but weirdly overexaggerated. The car is rushed to the garrison doctors at the Konak within about 5 minutes as it's really not far off from the scene but both are pronounced dead on arrival. So officially they lived for about 5 more minutes, 11am tops, while the medical report pretty much concludes that with the severity of their wounds they were both immediately dead.\n\nSo some of the stuff is nitpicking by me to fill space but the fact that they managed to throw in these *awful* mistakes that could've been rectified with a minute of Wikipedia fact check is just sad. Now they do acknowledge that they're not totally right in the video's comments but some errors just cannot slip into a video *just about that one historic event*.\n\n&gt; Hey everyone!  James Portnow here.  I write the series.  At the end of each full topic I'm going to do a live on camera episode called \"Lies\" where we talk about all the lies we told you and the mistakes we made.\n\nGotta say, I'm eagerly awaiting that day.\n\nI do have issues with the other two videos as well, but those I'll tackle tomorrow as it is quite late and I've got stuff to be awake for.",

        "title": "\"Jesus Never Existed Says New Report That Finds No Mention Of Christ In 126 Historical Texts\"",
        "author": "[deleted]",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hwpof/jesus_never_existed_says_new_report_that_finds_no/",
        "text": "[Link to article](http://www.inquisitr.com/1504964/jesus-never-existed/#xdLuRPGd9zddsqhm.01)\n\nThis article has been posted in /r/atheism and accrued almost 2,000 upvotes. \n\n&gt;Jesus never existed. That is the conclusion of a **researcher** who says he has combed 126 texts written during or shortly after the time Jesus is supposed to have lived — and found no mention of Jesus whatsoever.\n\nEmphasis mine. A \"researcher\" you say? What kind of researcher, pray tell? Oh, this researcher's article is linked in this article. He wrote it on \"jesusneverexisted.com\" I'm not up to date on all the scholarly journals. Can anyone tell me if this is one of them?\n\n&gt;Even the Apostle Paul, the New Testament figure credited with spreading the new religion that came to be called “Christianity” shortly after the supposed death of Jesus, never says that Jesus was a a real person\n\nIf only Paul had known that he should have written \"by the way, Jesus is a real person!\" Basically, if you interpret Paul the way you want to, then I guess you can end up making him say pretty much anything. While it may be likely that Paul did not personally know Jesus, it is a far cry to assume that Paul was completely ignorant of Jesus or even thought Jesus was mythic.\n\n&gt;While today Christianity has become the most popular religion in world history, with 2.2 billion human beings calling themselves Christians, Paulkovich points out that as late as the the Fourth Century, Christianity was still a small and widely persecuted cult.\n\n&gt;The invention of a mythical figure for followers of the cult to rally around gave the early Christians the strength to survive, according to this theory. On the other hand, another recent advocate of the “Mythical Jesus” believes that Christ was invented by the Romans as propaganda to pacify the public.\n\nWell now we've just entered into conspiracy-town here. Jesus was Roman propaganda! So in one breath they say that Christians were persecuted and in the next breath they say that Jesus was propaganda meant to pacify the public? If persecution is going on, *people are not pacified.* \n\nFinally... sigh... am I really going to have to say this? Yes. Yes, I am. Oh well, here goes: \n\nTo quote one of /r/atheism's favorite quotes \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\"\n\nThere. I said it. I could find 126 texts written in 1940 that make no mention of FDR. He must never have existed. \n\nJesus mythicism is a fringe group. [The vast majority of historians accept that Jesus was a historical person.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus#Jesus_as_myth) When Paulkovitch (or whoever) submit their entire process of research, textual criticism, etc. to a reputable historical publication, and when his works are peer-reviewed by reputable scholars, *then* (and only then) I might consider his hypothesis to be something other than wishful thinking.\n\nMore stuff to comply with R5: Scholars are sometimes divided on the Josephus texts referencing Jesus. However, many believe that at least one reference is an authentic reference to Jesus. Other ancient sources refer to Jesus as well. Tacitus, Suetonius, etc. One can point out that these are problematic texts because they all come at later dates, yes. However, \"problematic\" does not equal \"the dude never existed.\" It's also important to keep in mind that the early spread of Christianity happened in an atmosphere of skepticism (about these Christians) and sometimes violence. There were early writings going around talking about Christians, attacking Christians, etc. Yet none of these writings ever suggested that Jesus never existed. Is this definitive \"proof?\" No. But it is telling that even those arguing against Christians from the very beginning never doubted the existence of Jesus. \n\nIf we set a historical standard that every individual must be attested to (possibly multiple times) by someone who lived at the same time, then we can write a lot of historical figures out of existence. That's simply not how historical research works. Oral accounts do carry some weight. And insisting on a sharp distinction between a \"religious\" text and a \"secular\" (or whatever) text is to impose an anachronistic categorization onto 1st Century Roman and Judea understanding. That is what Paulkovitch is doing. Scholars do accept the New Testament as a historical document. (Again, that doesn't necessarily mean it is 100% historically accurate.) Within the New Testament alone, we have about half a dozen authors (depending) all speaking from an understanding that Jesus existed (whatever Paulkovitch claims from his special insight into Paul's mind). \n\nIs it any wonder that some high-class folks in Rome in the 1st Century had never heard of Jesus, a guy who died a failure in a foreign land with about a dozen followers? A guy who's followers did then later spread, but remained numerically low for quite a while afterwards? And whose followers largely worked within the Jewish synagogue system at first before spreading to those called Gentiles? As for Jewish texts regarding Jesus, it's important to remember that the Romans destroyed the Temple in their invasion of Judea in 70CE. Many texts were lost. Josephus' texts survive because he was with Caesar at the time. \n\nThere *is* a debate to be had over how much of what is believed about Jesus is accurate. But there is little debate to be had over his existence. The Jesus Seminar (for all their problematic stuff) and historical Jesus researchers are pretty well in one accord that there did exist a historical figure named Jesus (Joshua in Hebrew). He was likely baptized, and started a public ministry. He was then put to death by the authorities. From those, rather bare-bones, basics scholars then go on to discuss what the content of Jesus' teachings were, what else he might have done, how he might have understood his work, etc. \n\nBart Ehrman (an agnostic and historical Jesus scholar) completely discounts any idea of Jesus mythicism. Say what you will about Ehrman's (sometimes sensationalistic sounding) books, but the guy does know the historical-critical research backwards and forwards. John Dominic Crossan participated in the Jesus Seminar and is another name to check out, along with Marcus Borg. Again, say what you will of those folks (they are sometimes controversial in theological circles), but they know their stuff. ",

For realz!\" crowd. What OP and our tin-hatted friends forget to mention is that no Americans were to be killed, only a bunch of drones and unmanned ships were to be sunk, and the worse that would happen is that somebody would get roughed up. [Here is my full response:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2hsfzf/what_historical_fact_blows_your_mind_serious/ckwhbjs) \n\n*****\n\nOh for the love of... I see Northwoods on Reddit quite often and here is what OP never mentioned: **the architects of Northwoods never planned to kill Americans**. \n\nHere is what it says on the actual, unclassified document:\n\nPart of their plan was to sink a US Navy ship outside of Guantanamo and blame it on Cuba\n\n&gt;(11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals **for mock-victims**\n\nThey did not plan on killing any sailors if they blew up a ship, they even mention that they could use an unmanned drone instead:\n\n&gt;b. We could blow up a **drone (unmanned)** vessel anywhere in the Cuban waters... The US could follow up with an air/sea rescue operation covered by US fighters to \"evacuate\" the remaining members of the **non-existent** crew.\n\nAs for the staged attacks on the US, the worst they were going to do was to rough somebody up:\n\n&gt;4... We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida (real or **simulated**). We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even **to the extent of wounding** in instances to be widely publicized. Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, [they never specify if it would hurt anyone, but by saying \"carefully\" I assume that means in a spot where nobody could be harmed]\n\nLater on page 10 it goes on to say how they would duplicate a charter plane, have it \"shot down\" over Cuba and fabricate a story about how it was full of college kids. On page 11 it says a US Navy submarine would plant a plane wreck at the location the drone went down. Again, because it's a drone nobody would be harmed.\n\n[Here is the full document](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf), I'm sorry for the rant but I get my panties in a bunch when people use Northwoods and proof that the US government is killing it's own citizens. If it is, then Northwoods is not proof.\n\n*****\n\nNorthwoods was popuarized by the infamous \"documentary\" Loose Change as some kind of proof that the US government had the gall to stage 9/11.",

        "title": "Jimmy Carter: Saint or demigod?",
        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hsk14/jimmy_carter_saint_or_demigod/",
        "text": "I came across [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2hl32s/best_no_rules_picture_of_a_president/cktrk7f) in /r/pics the other day and have been mulling it over. It's an inaccurate comment, beyond a doubt, but it's what to look at that becomes the interesting problem. I'm going to choose to focus on:\n\n&gt; [Jimmy Carter] was also the only president since WWII to never fire a shot and achieve peace in the ME. But to some voters, that's pansy weakness. Real men start wars and bomb brown people.\n\nI'm a pretty big fan of Jimmy Carter, don't get me wrong. I think he's done some great things in his lifetime, and his presidency was guided by ideas that I largely agree with. That said, I can still recognise that, as much as I may wish it to be say, there were problems with Jimmy Carter's presidency that this post is whitewashing. It wasn't all love and snuggles with Carter.\n\nLet's get to the easier claim to debunk first: Carter brought peace to the Middle East. Now, as some of the child comments clarify, this is referring to the [Camp David Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords), a set of two agreements between Israel and Egypt. The Accords were the result of a months long multilateral outreach by the Carter administration to try and foster some sort of peace in the Middle East. Carter saw Kissinger's bilateral approaches to peace as a failed effort, and so initially sought to have a broader, multilateral approach to peace. This, in turn, began to fail as each of the countries that Carter approached (Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel) presented some sort of difficulty. Both Jordan and Syria refused to participate in these peace talks, leaving Carter and his administration to focus on brokering peace between Egypt and Israel. \n\nNow, it may seem to you - as it did to me - that an attempt to broker peace in the Middle East ought to include more of the Middle East than just two countries. You'd probably be right. Off the top of my head, I can think of more than a few conflicts that arose in the Middle East during Carter's presidency, including the Iran-Iraq War, the Lebanese Civil War, a Palestinian uprising, the Iranian Revolution, and a coup in Turkey. Even discounting intra-state violence, it's still a stretch to say that the Middle East was a peaceful place thanks to Carter. \n\nNow, that said, let's not discount what the Camp David Accords actually were. Signed in 1978, the Accords are one of only two peace treaties Israel has ever signed (the other being with Jordan in 1994), and did ensure civil relations between Egypt and Israel. It also set an important precedent for Arab-Israeli relations. Arab nations no longer presented a united front against Israel, making it possible for a more piecemeal approach to peace to be attempted. The peace between Israel and Jordan could certainly not have been achieved without the Camp David Accords as a precedent.\n\nOf course, as with any treaty, there were other repercussions, and these are also decidedly more difficult with regards to the assertion that Carter brought peace to the Middle East. No one here is psychic, and it's likely that no one in Carter's administration knew exactly what would happen after the Camp David Accords, but I suspect the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 and the suspension of Egypt's membership in the Arab League might have given them pause. \n\nSadat's assassination was a direct result of the decision to sign the Camp David Accords. Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists, outraged that he would sign a peace treaty with Israel. Indeed, one of the criticisms that has been levelled at the Accords is that it represents peace between Sadat and Israel, not between Egypt and Israel. For many of the Egyptian people, there was no real opportunity to engage with the peace treaty or accept it before Sadat's death, meaning it was always an imposed thing rather than something that belonged to them as much as to Sadat. Not to mention that Mubarak had opposed the Camp David Accords, meaning that their effectiveness as a lasting peace was questionable. Granted, the Accords have held, but in exchange, Egypt received Mubarak, whose human rights record is less than stellar. \n\nBut back to Egypt's suspension from the Arab League for a moment, because this is important. Prior to the Camp David Accords, Egypt had been the ten-ton gorilla in the room, holding power over the region. Afterwards, however, Arab nations like Syria refused to deal with Egypt, while others felt diplomatically snubbed. This created a power vacuum in the region, something which led to further conflict, especially with regards to relations with Iraq. \n\nMost important, though, was the impact on Israel-Palestinian relations. There were two agreements signed as part of the Camp David Accords, one with regards to peace with Egypt, and the other regarding the treatment of the Palestinians. The UN rejected this second agreement because the Palestinians were not included in its negotiation, but that doesn't mean it didn't leave an impact on Palestine. This agreement thrust the Palestinian problem to the forefront of Arab-Israeli relations, making it clear that this needed to be resolved, and that it had not been. This problem has been in the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts since.\n\nMy point with all this is simply that peace in the Middle East is a tricky thing to nail down. While Carter undoubtedly did what he could, the Middle East's various conflicts did not vanish under his watch. In some ways, he and his actions made some things worse, though they did also make some things better. The lesson here is that Carter was human, and he did what he could, but that trying wasn't always guaranteed to lead to perfect outcomes. \n\nBut speaking of imperfect outcomes, let's reconsider this part of our badhistory:\n\n&gt; He was also the only president since WWII to never fire a shot\n\nWell, on a literal level, this is not the case. Carter states [himself](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27Carter.html) that he has \"used weapons since I was big enough to carry one, and now own two handguns, four shotguns and three rifles, two with scopes,\" but I suspect that's not what the poster means. No, what I think the poster is referring to is the sentiment expressed in [this interview](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/11/president-jimmy-carter-interview) of Carter never having \"dropped a bomb. We never fired a bullet. We never went to war.\" This is true, but also not entirely true. \n\nThere's a few examples I'd like to look at. We'll start with [Operation Eagle Claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw), a military rescue solution to the Iran Hostage Crisis that, when it went wrong, arguably sank Carter's political career. After early negotiations in 1980 failed, Carter called for a military solution to the problem, albeit one that was much less...explosive than many other popular solutions. It was after this failed that Iran and the Carter Administration re-entered negotiations, eventually leading to the end of the Iran Hostage Crisis. But consider for a moment that a military solution was enacted. Even though it failed, it still ought to be considered that there was a plan enacted to use the American military to solve this particular problem. While technically no shots were fired, shots were intended to be fired, and that must count for something. Once again, Carter's solution was far less bloody than many of the solutions being tossed around (of which \"Bombs away!\" was high on the list), but it's not the pacifistic solution that the poster would imply.\n\nIt's not Operation Eagle Claw that sticks in my mind, though. Carter's not lying when he says he started no wars, but that doesn't mean he and his administration didn't fund and continue them. \n\nTo go on a bit of a tangent, I have a thing for truth commissions. I love them, and I think they're great. I've done loads of research on them and even published some, and golly gee, I could just go on all day about truth commissions. Seriously. Don't get me started.\n\nAnyway, one country with a truth commission that is particularly interesting to me in terms of its mechanics and effectiveness is the CAVR of Timor-Leste (or East Timor). The CAVR investigated crimes and atrocities that took place during the Indonesian invasion and subsequent occupation of Timor-Leste starting from 1975. This particular invasion was a rather brutal one, with at least [84 000](http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/updateFiles/english/CONFLICT-RELATED%20DEATHS.pdf) civilian casualties and over ten thousand forced disappearances. Entire villages were wiped out to the point where, when the CAVR arrived in the early 2000s to document the stories of these villages, there was no one left to tell what had happened. What the CAVR does investigate, though, is what allowed Indonesia to conduct this invasion. The report describes the relationship between the US and Indonesia as one of the US being a [\"major military sponsor.\"](http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/chegaFiles/finalReportEng/03-History-of-the-Conflict.pdf) This is not inaccurate. In declassified conversations between President Ford and President Suharto of Indonesia, Ford agrees to [provide military support through equipment](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB242/19750705.pdf) and [that the US would look the other way during an illegal invasion of Timor-Leste](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB242/19751206.pdf).  The CAVR chooses to interpret this as the invasion not having gone forward with guaranteed US support - while I wouldn't go that far, I do agree that US support meant that the invasion happened with the brutality and success that it did. \n\nOf course, I mentioned that all of that happened under Ford, and this post is about Carter. Carter, who the poster is claiming has no blood on his hands. It is completely fair to say that it is not Carter who started the funding of Indonesia's occupation of Timor-Leste, but it is Carter who [continued it](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB242/19770418.pdf). Indeed, Carter was presented with [several opportunities](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB242/19770418.pdf) to say something or question Suharto about the treatment of Timor-Leste and the Timorese, but did not, instead [increasing sales of weapons to Indonesia](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB242/19780426.pdf). \n\nThe question, of course, is how to respond to this. It is indeed not Carter who started the war, and Carter didn't commit any troops to it. Equally, it's not fair to condemn him for not speaking out against these atrocities. Politics is a dangerous game, and Indonesia was serving as a valuable US ally. Quite a bit would have been lost had Carter chosen to speak out against Suharto's treatment of the Timorese. However, it is equally unfair to hold Carter up as a shining example of what a president and his foreign policy ought to be, given that under Carter's presidency, atrocities were committed with the full support of the US government. \n\nThis is not the only example, but it's one I know best. There is also the example of Carter's administration [funding Pol Pot](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2014/04/how-thatcher-gave-pol-pot-hand) and [giving support and consent](http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-10-15/news/carter-hounded-by-kwangju-massacre/full/) to South Korea's military dictatorship and massacres under Chun Doo-Hwan. None of these are bloodless events, and the United States under Carter did still get its hands dirty in international affairs.\n\nBut I suppose all of this leads back to a philosophical question: how far does responsibility stretch? None of the events I cited are a direct result of Carter choosing to get involved with these places (with the possible exception of the Gwangju Massacre, depending on how you interpret history), and it could be argued that without that finger on the button, none of it counts. If Carter didn't give the order to massacre Timorese or Korean democracy activists, then he can't be held responsible. While I'll agree that it's difficult to define how far responsibility goes, I do think it's not unfair to say that if things happen that are directly funded by the US government with the full knowledge of what exactly that funding is paying for, it's not at all unreasonable to hold the head of that administration responsible. It's arguable whether Carter can really be held accountable for some of the things I've listed, but I'll happily make the case that by continuing to support the people who committed these acts, Carter was making himself and his administration part of the atrocities. \n\nI still love Jimmy Carter. I think he approached foreign policy with roughly the right idea, and I do see both the Camp David Accords and the [Torrijos-Carter Treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrijos%E2%80%93Carter_Treaties) as fine pieces of policy. However, I can admire Carter while recognising that he played a political game of supporting certain regimes and choosing not to see certain actions. Jimmy Carter was not a perfect president, nor is his administration a bloodless one. That said, I do think the world is a better place for having Jimmy Carter in it, and I do think he had the right idea. Just not always the right idea, and not always the right way of being a good president.",

        "text": "[The thread.](http://np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2hptpd/former_slave_named_gordon_shows_his_whipping/ckv53vz)\n\nThere's not much here to break down aside form outright slavery apologia and whitewashing of the racism inherent to slavery, but I'll still go through the formality of making a full post.\n\n&gt;only 1.5% of all americans owned slaves.\n\nThat's true, according to the 1860 census, which reports about 394k slaveowners in a total U.S. free population of 27.23 million. Now, there are some problems with what this person is implying by sharing that statistic, which is a misleading figure on the prevalence of slavery in the United States.\n\n1. This is not a good statistic to use without a heavy amount of comparison, specifically to number of households that owned slaves, as well as geographic and breaking down number of slaves owned per slaveowner, which reveals a lot more. Households owning slaves would've represented about 8% of the total number of households in the United States, while even that's misleading. If we break this down between North and South, and then by regions of the South, you get a lot more relevant information. If we take the South as a whole, then the percentage comes out to about 27%, but with a wide range of figures by state. Mississippi comes in highest at 49%, while Delware comes lowest at a mere 3%. Now, because there's wide variation between the Upper South and the Deep South, I'm going to break that down as well. For the Upper South (which includes DE, MD, KY, MO, TN, VA, AK, and NC), the figure comes out to 18.75%, with NC having the highest figure for any individual state at 28%. For the Deep South it comes out to 36.86%, with the lowest figure being LA at 20%. These figures better show the extent of attachment to slavery, while they still don't reveal concentration of slavery among the wealthy. Around 12% of slaveowners held more than 20 slaves, which numbers on the largest plantations reaching into the hundreds, with one example of a household owning over 1.000 slaves, thirteen examples of households owning between 500-999 slaves, and 2.25k owning 100-499. The highest categories are about 97.3k households owning 10-49 slaves, with 187k owning between 1-4.\n\n2. This includes the more populated Northern states, where the official figures of slave ownership are zeros across the board, drastically affecting the mean this person provides. If we take the total number of slaveowners across the South entirely, including the states that stayed with the Union, we get a figure of about 4.75% of free persons being slaveowners. \n\nI'm going directly off the 1860 census there, found on census.gov, as well as Lee Soltow's analysis drawn from the same in *Men and Wealth in the United States 1850-1870*.\n\n&gt;And a slave cost about 3 years of wages in cash to purchase (using the median wage of the white male as the standard).\n\nI have no idea where he's getting that figure—if it's the median for the entire U.S. or for the South, or for which occupation(s). I know that the U.S. Department of Labor, BLS's report on earnings up to 1928, conducted under Sec. Frances Perkins, lists the average monthly income between $10-15 for a farm laborer in 1866, while a collaborative study on incomes from 1774-1860 by Peter Lindert (UC-Davis) and Jeffrey Williamson (Harvard) does find growing wealth disparity, particularly in the Old South around 1800-1860, suggesting the growth of a poor underclass of free persons around this time. This is further evidenced by the fact that the bottom 40% of Southern households (all) in 1774 accounting for approximately 11% of of total incomes generated, with ditto (free) accounting for 20% of incomes. In 1860, this drops to about 11.3-12.5 percent across the Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic, with about 12.5-13.5 to the East and West South Central U.S., though I'm having trouble with figures of estimated mean or median income for Southern agricultural laborers in this period. As for the cost of a slave, here are figures for Texas, according to the state's historical society:\n\n&gt;Slave prices inflated rapidly as the institution expanded in Texas. The average price of a bondsman, regardless of age, sex, or condition, rose from approximately $400 in 1850 to nearly $800 by 1860. During the late 1850s, prime male field hands aged eighteen to thirty cost on the average $1,200, and skilled slaves such as blacksmiths often were valued at more than $2,000.\n\n[This study](http://www.measuringworth.com/slavery.php#foot18) co-authored and pointed out to me by an economics professor I happen to know goes into more detail on what that means.\n\nIt's all beside the point, in that it's very clear that slavery was very common, and it was well within the ability of of a very large portion of families to purchase slaves. And none of this somehow diminishes the ubiquity and importance of slavery in the U.S. South, or somehow makes it less horrific.\n\n&gt;So it was the upper class who owned slaves, not white people.\n\nThe upper class wasn't white? Nevertheless, many beyond slaveowners were complicit in slavery, and nearly all southern whites had a vested interest in seeing slavery maintained as it was.\n\n&gt;Also, about 4% of all slaveowners were NONwhites.\n\nWhich is a very small amount, and ignores geographic distribution. Most black slaveowners were centered around New Orleans, with some exceptions—and even still, within Louisiana, they still represented a vast minority of slaveowners, so I don't really see the point here. There's also the fact that only black persons could be victims of slavery or forced servitude since the disappearance of indentured servitude. They could certainly be exploited, but that's not the same thing, making it irrelevant.\n\n&gt;You fakeLeftists need to learn to read something other than what the Establishment tells you to read.\n\nIn other words, \"I'm smarter than you because I see for *myself* and won't be lied to like the rest of you sheeple...\"\n\n&gt;Start with the 1860 census.\n\n\"...but be sure to use this report by the U.S. government (aka 'Establishment') to find out more.\"",

        "text": "Thanks to [a thread in r/AskHistorians](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2hnets/did_alexander_the_great_hold_any_religious_views/), I recently came across this rather interesting article about Alexander the Great. Apparently it was [submitted](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2hmshh/til_alexander_the_great_and_aristotle_were/) to the always-wonderful r/todayilearned as \"Til - Alexander the Great and Aristotle were monotheist Deists and is why they didn't obliterate the Jewish people.\" I did actually start this post as a response in r/AskHistorians but I decided to edit most of it out since it really wasn't an answer to OP's question.\n\nAnyways, here is the article in question:\n\nhttp://www.jewishhistory.org/alexander-the-great/\n\nI've taken courses on Greek history in general and Alexander in specific, so the idea that Alexander was a monotheist seemed a bit interesting to me. So, lets see how the article supports that claim. Before it gets to Alexander, of course, it provides a brief overview of pre-Alexandrian Greek history.\n\n&gt; Unable to ever successfully put up a united force or government, the Greek tribes developed as city-states. The most famous were: Athens, Sparta, Thebes (not to be confused with the Thebes of Ancient Egypt) and Macedonia. For 500 years, Greek history was characterized by a series of conflicts such as the Peloponnesian Wars, as well as many other nameless wars between Athens and Sparta, and everybody against everybody else.\n\nMacedon was not really a city state, and there were other things that happened in those \"500 years,\" but so far there is nothing atrocious.\n\n&gt; In the last Peloponnesian War, which happened in about 420 BCE, Sparta made an agreement with Persia to use part of the Persian navy to bottle up the Athenian fleet. Athens always had a great navy, which often was the decisive factor in victory over land-locked Sparta. However, in the last Peloponnesian War, the Persians bottled up the Athenian fleet and the Spartans won the war.\n\nPersia did provide assistance to Sparta. However, most of this assistance was financial - they helped the Spartan admiral Lysander construct his own fleet, rather than just using their own navy. So it should really be \"the Spartans with Persian assistance and funding bottled up the Athenian fleet,\" but still, none of this is that atrocious.\n\n&gt; However, the victory came at a great price: the Persians were now in Greece for the first time.\n\nUm...\n\n..\n\nI think I've found one of the few individuals who could be *benefited* by watching the movie *300.* Yeah, the Persians \"were now in Greece for the first time\"... if you ignore Darius I's invasion of Greece in 492 BC and Xerxes I's invasion of Greece in 480 BC. I'm pretty certain that those two invasions involved Persians, in Greece. Also, while Persia failed in both of those invasions, they did maintain garrisons in various Aegean Greek islands, as well as on Cyprus, and they controlled Greek settlements in Asia Minor which were just as Greek as Greek cities located within the borders of modern-day Greece (after all, those borders didn't exist in the 5th century BC).\n\n&gt; The Persians also made a great mistake, because they were now in a place people came to resent them. The resulting hatred toward the Persians created a common enemy and thereby laid the groundwork for a great leader to step in and do what no one before him was able to do: unite the powerful and industrious Greek peoples.\n\nMaybe it is just poor wording on the authors part, maybe it is my misinterpretation, but I think that if someone who didn't know Greek history were to read this, they would assume that the Persians actually took over or occupied large parts of Greece after the Peloponnesian Wars. Because for some reason Sparta would just invite them in?\n\nThe period from the Peloponnesian Wars to Philip II establishing Macedonian hegemony over Greece was characterized by Persian meddling in Greek affairs and an increase in Persia's influence in Greek politics. This is perhaps best seen in the Peace of Antalcidas, a treaty that ended the *Corinthian War*, not the earlier Peloponnesian Wars.\n\nAnyways, bad blood between the Greeks and Persians predated the Peloponnesian and Corinthian War by quite a while. Greeks might have resented Persian influence in Greek politics but this resentment came on top of preexisting feelings towards the Persians. After all, Persia did try to invade the place *twice*. Philip's justification for war with Persia was Persia's actions in their invasions of Greece, not Persia's support of Sparta. Diodorus Siculus is a good ancient source on Philip II, and he mentions that [Philip's pretext for war was that Persia had burnt temples during their invasions of Greece.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/16D*.html#89)\n\nThe article sort of skips the Corinthian War and the rise of Thebes and goes on to Philip II, but that's okay. I'll do that as well. It talks about about Philip's rise and then mentions this:\n\n&gt; However, his dream of empire included taking Persia away from the Persians! It was an audacious thought. Persia ruled the world. No one dared challenge them.\n\nPersia didn't exactly rule the world, though I suppose one can say that they ruled a vast portion of the *known* world. Still, plenty of people challenged them - I mean, the Delian League had fought a war against Persia, and rebellions were quite common - various Ionian city-states, the Egyptians, etc. But I suppose the author meant \"challenge them as rulers of the world,\" which would make more sense - those rebellions were fought for independence, not to take over the Achaemenid Empire.\n\n&gt; However, Philip took his battle-tested army into Asia Minor, near what is today Constantinople, and in one of the classic battles of history defeated the Persian army. Unbelievably, the Persian Empire fell apart.\n\nWhat battle was this? This great battle that destroyed the Persian Empire? I really would like to know. For ages I thought that it was Alexander who defeated the Persian Empire. If the Persian Empire \"fell apart\" because of Philip, what was that thing that Alexander spent so much effort trying to defeat?\n\n&gt; As he turned to conquer the rest of the world, he died, which often happens. Just when someone thinks he has it made it turns out that he made the reckoning without taking God into consideration.\n\nWell yeah, he was assassinated.\n\nAnyways, Philip's dead so we can move on to good old Alexander.\n\n&gt; Philip did not want Alexander to grow up to be a coarse and boorish Macedonian. So he gave him a tutor: the renowned philosopher Aristotle. It was Aristotle who implanted in Alexander the philosophic ideals of the Greeks.\n\nI'm glad that the author of this article has some sort of magical insight into what Philip II was thinking. Little did I know that Philip II didn't want his own son to grow up in his own culture. Earlier on in the article the author mentioned that the Athenians and Spartans thought that the Macedonians were \"coarse and boorish,\" but I guess now Philip thinks that as well.\n\n&gt; Alexander was not a pagan because Aristotle was not a pagan. Aristotle’s concept of God was that a Creator exists. The Greek philosophers referred to God as the “First Cause.” He pushed the button, so to speak. However, once He did so He did not do anything more. What happened on Earth did not interest him. Therefore, there was no interference from Heaven as to what happened on Earth. It was another way of unburdening themselves of conscience – except now with the stamp of belief in God.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, the Greeks believed that God existed, which is very important because it will help explain one reason why Alexander was able to tolerate the Jewish religion, whereas many of the Persian emperors were not. Aristotle knew that all the stories of the gods – from Apollo to Zeus – were made-up. Alexander, as Aristotle’s student, also believed that. Thanks to Aristotle, therefore, the ideas of the Jews were much more acceptable to Alexander.\n\nOh boy. This is... well, something.\n\nI should say that I am not an expert on Aristotelian philosophy. There are many people here who probably know more of it than I do.\n\nThat being said, I do know enough to say that Aristotelian metaphysics can't be so neatly simplified into some sort of pseudo-Abrahamic monotheism. Aristotle's ideas are not entirely incompatible with monotheism - after all, monotheistic theologians from all three Abrahamic faiths were influenced by Aristotle. Thomas Aquinas, Averroes, Maimonides, et cetera. These theologians incorporated and interpreted Aristotle's philosophies in creative and unique manners. They didn't just oversimplify the hell out of it like this article does.\n\nAlso, there is *no* real evidence to suggest that Alexander's views on religion were deeply influenced by Aristotle. On the other hand, there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that Alexander had no real issue with buying into the traditional Mediterranean polytheism of the day.\n\nThe article talks about Alexander arriving in Judea and then mentions this:\n\n&gt; The Talmud describes the drama of that first encounter (Yoma 69a). Simon the Just came forth with other members of the priesthood, as well as the sages of the Sanhedrin, to greet Alexander at the gates of Jerusalem as he strode in on his famous white horse, which he rode all over the world in his conquests. According to the historians of the time, it was an enormously tall horse and Alexander was an enormously tall person. Plus, he always wore a plumed helmet. Combined, Alexander stood about 13 feet high on the horse. He was an awe-inspiring sight to behold.\n\n&gt; When Alexander saw the Simon he dismounted and bowed to him. When he was questioned by his advisors, he told them that whenever he went into battle he dreamed of an angel leading him to victory. The face of the Jewish High Priest, he said, was the face of the angel he saw in his dreams. That was why he bowed down to him.\n\nI don't think that I have to explain why one shouldn't take this part of the Talmud at face value. I haven't read the Talmud, but if this is what it says about Alexander's encounter with Simon, I think it would be safe to say that this account - while not necessarily completely false - has probably been influenced by strong bias. That a Jewish religious document makes a Jewish religious leader seem so puissant should really be an indication that this should be taken with a grain of salt rather than presented as straight history.\n\nJosephus talks a bit about this encounter as well. However, considering that Arrian, Diodorus, and Plutarch don't mention it at all, I'd take Josephus's account with a grain of salt as well.\n\n&gt; Because of Aristotle, Alexander was positively disposed toward the Jews. Instead of destroying and subjugating them, he made an arrangement with them. As long as they would be his loyal vassals and pay their taxes they could remain autonomous. That was an enormous concession because Alexander was rarely that accommodating to anyone.\n\nAlexander made this sort of arrangement with lots of people. He had no qualms killing those who resisted or rebelled against him, but people who surrendered were generally spared as long as they agreed to be loyal and pay taxes.\n\nEgypt surrendered to Alexander and Alexander even visited Egyptian temples. Arrian, Diodorus, and Plutarch all mention this. Alexander even seems to have been very taken by these Egyptian temples and oracles. But how could Alexander, a supposedly monotheistic man, be so \"positively disposed\" towards both Egyptian polytheism and Judaism? It strikes me that Alexander didn't really care what his subjects believed as long as they were loyal. That, and he probably wasn't a monotheist, but rather, polytheistic.\n\nLook, I don't know what Alexander thought about the Jews, but I think it is safe to say that it would be *way* easier to argue that Alexander was more \"positively disposed\" towards the Egyptian mythology than it would be to argue that he had a thing for Judaism. When it comes to the history of Alexander, I'll take Arrian over Josephus and the Talmud any day.\n\nThe article ends by talking a bit more about the Jews after Alexander's conquest, and given that I am very, very poorly versed in Jewish history I'll let that be.\n\nHere are links to the ancient historians I mention:\n\n[Arrian's Anabasis](https://archive.org/details/cu31924026460752)\n\n[Diodorus Siculus's Library of History](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/home.html)\n\n[Plutarch's Life of Alexander](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/home.html)\n\nThis is my first post in this sub, and I'm no historian, so if you have anything to add or correct please do.",

It portrays the 1746 Battle of Culloden that resulted in the British Army's destruction of the Scottish Jacobite rising of 1745 and, in the words of the narrator, \"tore apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands\". Described in its opening credits as \"an account of one of the most mishandled and brutal battles ever fought in Britain\", Culloden was hailed as a breakthrough for its cinematography as well as its use of non-professional actors and its presentation of an historical event in the style of modern TV war reporting. The film was based on John Prebble's study of the battle.[1]\n\n[link to stream](http://synchtu.be/r/Bad_History)\n",

        "text": "Edit: ***CORRECTIONS TO MY POST*** because I've been painting walls all day and I'm tired and make mistakes.\n\n- Slavery existed well before European intervention in Africa. What I should've said is that European interest in the trade had a large effect on slavery in Africa\n\n- For the Arab slave trade I should've used that there was not religious *imperative* to have non-Muslims as slaves. That is to say, they weren't like \"Allah has commanded we take the infidels for slaves!\" It was that slavery was just a part of what they did, and Muslims were protected under the Ummah, so only Non-Muslims could be slaves. It's confusing to talk about, yes. Patrick Manning is my source for all of that stuff.\n\n- Sort of correction, I just want to note ***I'm not trying to excuse anyone's involvement in slavery or perpetuating it. I'm a fucking anarchist, fuck slavery in all forms.*** What I'm bringing up is against the agenda behind the statements that mix in muddy language and misconceptions to try to ignore the racial effects of slavery in America and how that is still felt today.\n\nSo, if you saw my post yesterday, I carpool with a Tea Party Libertarian, the \"State's Rights\" kind of person. It may just become a saga of me submitting stuff he says (Cause I need to blow off steam but don't like confrontation when it probably won't do anything anyway) so here's today's addition of shit my carpool says.\n\nSo today it started off with a rant about how sociology is stupid because it blames everything on white Christian men. So, naturally, slavery had to come into play. And it starts with our favorite sentence\n\n&gt;Actually, if you look at it, Africans were selling each other to the Europeans\n\nDAE Africa is a homogenous group and there was totally no warfare or tribes or anything? Not to mention, how does that excuse what the Europeans did?\n\n&gt;And they were doing it because they needed the market to get rich off of\n\nWat? I'm pretty sure the market existed because of European interest in it, and the Africans needed to be able to survive, and so taking prisoners and selling them was a good way to deal with, ya know... European imperialism and colonization, but apparently that don't real. I've never heard anyone argue the Africans were doing it to get rich. And, as far as I know, African tribes holding slaves was more akin to POW and indentured servitude, not chattel slavery that was carried out in the slave trade. But, he goes into another part I actually *haven't* heard before [Spoiler alert: It still sucks]\n\n&gt;And it was also the Arabs that were selling Africans to the Europeans because they took prisoners of anyone that was kafir or \"infidel.\"\n\nOk, this is wrong on *many* accounts.\n\nNow, I'm not an expert, but I don't think the Arab slave trade and Trans-Atlantic Slave trades really crossed paths (Correct me if I'm wrong though)\n\nAlso, the Arab slave trade *caught Europeans too* it wasn't a purely taking slaves from Africa thing, because my next point\n\nUnlike the justification used in Trans-Atlantic slave trade, race was not a factor in the Arab slave trade. Slaves were of a lot of different races, and in fact, the Arab identity didn't even exist at the time. But slavery in America was *specifically* racially based as justification for the Trans-Atlantic trade. And finally.\n\nIslam wasn't a motivation... sort of. It gets kind of complicated in this area. The slaves were non-Muslims, yes, but not specifically for that reason. Muslims would have been considered under the the Ummah, and so they were under protection of the state. Non-Muslims were not automatically put into slavery. However, you could argue *some* involvement of Islam because they were, essentially \"fair game\" if they did not pay the Jizya tax. Many times though, it was a POW situation, not a \"They're non-believers!\" situation. But even at this, it was not always the same as chattel slavery, as slave-holders were told that if their slave asks for a \"deed\" that says how much work they need to do to be set free, then they should grant that deed. (I'm unsure, however, if there were chattel slavery situations in the Arab slave trade, someone else would need to verify that for me.)\n\nRegardless, it was nothing but a bunch of thinly veiled.... ok, not even veiled at all, racism and fear of dem evil Muslims.",

        "text": "The bad history in this case comes from my sister's Facebook feed. She's not all that relevant to this, really, but it's her friends. I suspect, though, that the idea of binary sexes with no room for in between or fluidity that they're expressing in this particular instance is one that is shared not only between them, but by those who share their ultra-conservative leanings. It's the idea that, by possessing a vagina, one automatically ought to have (and indeed does have) certain traits, like modesty, submissiveness, and all that jazz (but no jazz because jazz is evil). There's nothing bad history about this particular bit, don't get me wrong. The bad history comes in with [this quote](http://i.imgur.com/B2KORfe.png) in which one person expresses the idea that the study of gender, the gender/sex division, the theory of gender as a social construct, and the general discussion about gender and sexuality was created solely to justify lifestyles that she, personally, doesn't agree with or follow. Now, regardless of your feelings about sexuality or debates about nature and nurture or inherent qualities of a sex or gender, the history of gender studies and of gender as a socially constructed thing is an entirely separate thing, and one which I am more than happy to describe in greater detail than anyone cares about.\n\nWe'll start with the history of the understanding of social constructs. To be clear, I'm not a sociologist, but I do live with one, which I think gives me some credit. I also don't know how familiar people are with the theories and thinkers I'll be invoking, so I'll explain them as I understand them. Social constructs, briefly, are things that have meaning or which exist solely because society has agreed they should exist. Money is a good example of a social construct - without a society to back it, money would be meaningless and worthless. It is what it is because of society. Another example is a cup. While there may be some inherent characteristics to the cup (holds stuff), society assigns greater meaning to it, and assigns different meanings based on which society or what cup it is (think Holy Grail vs. sippy cup. Both are cups and both have the same basic properties, but they are radically different cups). \n\nWhat about gender? The traditional view is that gender is inherently linked to sex, and that we are \"men\" or \"women\" because of what's between our legs and the hormones that are produced because of it. Men are male and masculine because they have penises, and women are female and feminine because they have vaginas. Nature made us who we are. However, a social construction theory of gender says that, rather than being inherent, our gender is a product of the environment around us (to what degree is debated, with some saying it's completely a result of the environment around us, and others saying there's a combination of nature and nurture at work). This theory is not entirely accepted, though it is largely accepted within the social scientific community. To make it absolutely clear how it works, bear in mind that the social construction theory works with two terms - sex and gender. \"Sex\" is what hangs between your legs and is the physical aspect, while \"gender\" is your attributes and how you behave. Some accept that there's a distinction, and some do not. \n\nSo what about history? This is /r/badhistory, after all, even if so far I've managed to turn it into /r/Quouarspoutssociology. In her article \"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis,\" Joan Scott states that the sex/gender distinction has its roots in 1975 with Natalie Davis' call for inclusivity of women and women's studies within social science. This is not wholly inaccurate - gender studies certainly has its roots in the 1970s and the feminist movements of the time. [UC Berkeley's](http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/about/history) gender studies department makes it very clear that their goal is to \"introduce the subject of women into serious academic inquiry.\" In short, gender studies sprang up to address the fact that women had been largely excluded from study and from the historical narrative. It sprang out of feminism, sure, but that is different from saying that it sprang up to justify a particular lifestyle. Rather, it served to address a gap in academia, much like religious studies, anthropology, or sociology.\n\nAnd speaking of sociology! The idea of sex and gender being separate is much older than gender studies and has its roots in sociology and the gender equality movement. By the late 18th century, early feminists (and I use the term loosely, knowing the arguments that can arise) such as Mary Wollstonecraft were publishing tracts espousing equal rights for women. While these tracts don't touch on the ideas of the linkages between sex and gender, they do present the idea that women are more than they have been traditionally viewed as. These works establish the idea that the image of \"woman\" that had been traditionally agreed upon was flawed. If that was flawed, what else about the conversation might be flawed? Once again, none of these early thinkers argued that gender and sex were different things, but without their work, the argument could not have been made. Possibly one of the earliest examples of tackling the question of nature vs. nurture in terms of gender can be found in John Stuart Mill's [\"The Subjection of Women\"](http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm), published in 1869. In it, Mill argues that:\n\n&gt;  The anxiety of mankind to interfere in behalf of nature, for fear lest nature should not succeed in effecting its purpose, is an altogether unnecessary solicitude. What women by nature cannot do, it is quite superfluous to forbid them from doing.\n\nIs that not the most feminist piece of writing you've ever laid eyes on? In all seriousness, there is more to it. While it does talk about the \"nature\" of women, it does open the door to the idea that what we think of as the \"nature of women\" is not necessarily a product of nature, but rather, a moulded and shaped thing, a product of influence. He's opened the door to the idea that traditional views of femininity are a product, not a reality. Was Mill trying to justify a particular lifestyle? While his wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, was a large advocate for women's rights and women's equality, she was also a dutiful mother and wife, and probably didn't live a life that would be considered terribly scandalous today (though she was scandalous by the 19th century's standards). Likely, this essay was written out of an earnest desire to argue for gender equality, not to make Harriet and John feel better about their lifestyles.\n\nWhile there continued to be discussion of women and what women ought or ought not to be doing throughout history, 1949 saw the publication of one of the major works of second-wave feminism. Simone de Beauvoir's \"The Second Sex\" is a major feminist work, tracing the treatment of women through history. While the work itself doesn't necessarily make a claim regarding sex and gender and the relation between them, it does have the fantastic idea that:\n\n&gt; One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.\n\nas well as \n\n&gt; Social discrimination produces in women moral and intellectual effects so profound that they appear to be caused by nature\n\nThis is much closer to what I mean when I talk about a theory of the social construction of gender. While Simone de Beauvoir likely wasn't going into what you or I would consider a thorough examination of social construction, the first hints of it are there. There is the idea that what a woman is is developed over time rather than there from the outset. \n\nCouple this with Money's quote from 1955 which states that:\n\n&gt; The term gender role is used to signify all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself/herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.\n\nand you start to have a very familiar sight indeed. Money was the first to use the term \"gender role\" and is credited for having introduced it with its current implications.\n\nThe work that I'd argue provides the biggest counter-argument to the linked quote and the biggest counter-argument to the idea that feminism and the modern gender debate are created to justify a certain lifestyle would be \"The Feminine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan. In it, Friedan looks at housewives in the 1950s who were largely unhappy with their lives and their lifestyles. Despite living what could be seen as a perfectly feminine life, these women wanted something more out of life and more from themselves. Friedan examines media portrayal of women and how it changed from women as adventurers and heroines in the 1920s and 1930s to a dichotomy of women as either happy housewives or unhappy workers. From this and other analyses of the 1940s-1950s refocusing on women as housewives and mothers, she draws the conclusion that what women are is not what they are being presented with. The idea of femininity presented to women differed wildly from what women actually wanted. It's not that these women were trying to justify an alternative lifestyle or that they wanted to engage in what the linked poster might consider a deviant lifestyle. Rather, they found that the image of femininity they were presented with didn't match what they themselves understood themselves to be.\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rapid increase in the number of thinkers looking at what made women women. Activist Kate Millett, for instance, wrote that gender was \"the sum total of the parents', the peers', and the culture's notions of what is appropriate to each gender by way of temperament, character, interests, status, worth, gesture, and expression\" and that it had \"essentially cultural, rather than biological bases.\" de Beauvoir's idea of becoming rather than being a woman is in full display here, with ideas of gender as a formed thing. \n\nIn this same climate of social change and an increased desire to include previously buried narratives, we find the formation of gender studies as a formal academic discipline. While the 1960s did see some efforts to include women and women's voices into \"free classes\" in universities across the world, it wasn't until 1969 that formal classes in women's studies were taught in American universities. It was in these American classes that we first find the sex/gender distinction, and by 1975, it was being used regularly within gender studies literature (though sometimes with terms reversed, and radically differently in other languages). This new inclusion of women was due to women perceiving the exclusion of a female voice from academia as a political decision, and thus one that could be changed. It was based in ideas of increasing knowledge as broadly as possible, and was coupled with a call for racial, ethnic, class, and sexuality studies. In the 1970s, gender studies more firmly focused not only on including women in history, but also on examining what forces formed women (and, by extension, men). There were, however, debates over what women's studies ought to be, with some feeling it ought to be almost exclusively dedicated to feminist critiques of academic disciplines and others believing it should be more consciousness-raising and knowledge-building. There were lawsuits over this, with some gender studies' students wanting to exclude men and male professors. These debates still go on, though lawsuits are far less frequent. Largely, however, gender studies can be viewed as wanting to include women's voices in social science and examining how gender is formed and performed. \n\nThere is one more text well worth mentioning in our brief sweep through the formation of gender studies and gender as a social construct. In 1990, Judith Butler published \"Gender Trouble,\" a seminal work in both gender studies and queer studies. In it, she critiques the idea of a universal \"feminine experience,\" arguing that it's vital to keep in mind the myriad of other factors - such as race, class, and sexuality - that characterise a lived experience. Indeed, she argues, there is nothing but a gender performance, with everything being a product of this performed experience. It is vital to look at sex and gender as both having more than two possibilities, seeing as it's being influenced by so many things, and seeing as there's so many ways to perform. In this view, the new appearance of lifestyles that were previously unknown could be seen as \"the exposure of the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals.\" Basically, the new exposure of gay rights or feminism was not to convert children to the gay, but to perform gender in a way it needed to be performed and in a way which was natural to perform.\n\nNeither sociology nor gender studies stop there, of course, but I'm not comfortable enough in my own knowledge to continue. Besides, the question that was raised was one of the motivating factors behind the current gender and sexuality debate, and the questions about gender and sex. Of course gender studies wasn't founded by women trying to justify sleeping around, and of course sociology didn't investigate the sex/gender connection to justify \"unfeminine\" women. Of course not. These are questions of human knowledge that have been raised for centuries, or so I hope my post has shown. The problem that I've run into, though, is that the women who are interested in these questions and the women who have written about and devoted their lives to their investigation are precisely the type of women that my linked poster would squawk at as \"bad women.\" They were active outside the home and outside the domestic arena. Some of them did have sex outside marriage or refrained from having kids or wore pants on a Sunday. To someone like the poster, these are more than enough reasons to say that gender studies and investigations of gender must have been clearly instigated to justify women being \"unfeminine.\" I can't necessarily argue against it because whatever I do, the fact that these women were active outside the domestic sphere means that they were both the type of woman that would be able to go out and found these disciplines as well as the type of women that would be excluded from the poster's definition of \"woman\" is still there. That's fine. I accept that I won't convince that particular poster. What I will say, though, is that the expansion of human knowledge should not itself be dismissed because the people doing it don't ascribe to your particular lifestyle. Gender studies, sociology of gender, and the theory of gender as a social construct is still valid, and would be even if it had set out with the explicit purpose of throwing gay pride parades and having women work in busy careers. Which it wasn't. That's just dumb.\n\n**Things I read so you don't have to:**\n\nGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity by Judith Butler\n\nA Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft\n\nWomen's studies: Its origins, its organization and its prospects by Sheila Tobias, published in Women's Studies International Quarterly volume 1 issue 1\n\n[The Subjection of Women](http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm) by John Stuart Mill\n\nGender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis by Joan W.

I'll copy it here as well:\n\n&gt; Wonderful post OP! As far as I am aware, it is Ann Oakley who is widely credited within sociology as drawing the distinction between biological sex and and gender as social constructions of masculine/feminine characteristics in her work, Sex, Gender, and Society , published in 1972. Her argument was that these socially constructed characteristics are then crudely mapped onto human bodies, so that, for example, because women give birth, therefore to be feminine is to be nurturing and caring. Although you don't go beyond 1990 with Butler, a current trend starting with Martin (2003) is to consider the performance of gender as the selection from repertoires of practice; repertoires of social actions and behaviours that individuals enact in response to their environment and context, so you can construct different forms of masculinity and femininity (so, for example, a male builder on a building site is likely enacting a different form of masculinity to a male software developer in a high-tech startup). This allows for more fluidity in how we express our gendered identity (e.g. a man acting boisterously whilst spectating at a sports match is enacting a different form of masculinity to when he wakes up in the morning and helps his child with their schoolwork), but the challenge then becomes whether the repertoires of practice that you choose are contextually appropriate, and overly rejecting the appropriate gender roles is a risky practice as it would be seen as subverting the \"natural order\" of things. So gender is fluid in that we are all capable of (and expected to) select from different repertoires of practice depending on the context, and as you say, these concepts weren't created to justify sleeping around but are rooted in a long and deep inquiry into why and how men and women act differently not only between sexes but within sexes!",

His writings are descriptions of the of Volga Vikings and their practices, such as ship burials.\n\nViking Age Scandinavia is a big interest of mine (among many other things). Despite being far from an expert, or even a historian, i know a good deal about it... But if i make a mistake, i would *greatly* appreciate corrections.\n\nI won't be foccusing on the actual events that much because almost none of it is rooted in actual historical events (needless to say Ahmed ibn Fadlan did not travel to Northern Scandinavia or fight ancient enemies with his Viking buddies). What the movie gets wrong are the representation of actual Viking Age Scandinavian culture, mostly in the realms of attire, armour, weapons and even the type of buildings shown. So this wil be rather short i imagine.\n\nSo, break out your mead and historically inaccurate armour and let's dive into this steaming pile of shit.\n\n______\n\n\nThe story revolves around our long named hero, shortened to Ibn for ease of pronounciation, played by Antonio Banderas. In this movie, he's not a dignified emmisary... he was exiled for having the hots for a fellow noblemans wife... Which i'm pretty sure did not happen to the really Ibn.\n\nOn his way there he and his party are rescued from Tartars by Vikings, who then take the group to their camp, where Ibn gets first hand experience of Viking Age Scandinavian culture....\n\n**VIKING SPIT WASHING**\n\n___\n\nFirst of all, **i am pretty sure that [Viking Age Scandinavians](http://i.imgur.com/9pvQPue.jpg) [did not](http://i.imgur.com/cwcWSlY.jpg) [clean themselves\n](http://i.imgur.com/0ZUVwVo.jpg) [with each others spit and mouthwash.](http://i.imgur.com/bHgJKoT.jpg)**\n\nYes ladies and gentleman, it's *that* kind of Viking movie... Where all the vikings are filthy manly barbarian who disgust the [prissy and feminine](http://i.imgur.com/JEIkT80.jpg) Arab man with their raunchy manliness and beards...\n\nThis is despite the fact that Viking Age Scandinavians were actually very attentive towards their personal care and grooming... There are [finds of combs in Scandinavia, and they're pretty common,](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/comb_historical.jpg) and in several places in Iceland there are [hot baths] \n(http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/snorri_bath.jpg) and bathing is mentioned in several sagas and poems:\n\n\nFrom Reginsmál (25):\n\n&gt; Combed and washed every thoughtful man should be\n&gt; and fed in the morning;\n&gt; for one cannot foresee where one will be by evening;\n&gt; it is bad to rush headlong before one's fate.\n\nHávamál (61)\n\n&gt; Washed and fed, a man should ride to the Assembly\n&gt; though he may not be very well dressed;\n&gt; of his shoes and breeches no man should be ashamed\n&gt; nor of his horse, though he doesn't have a good one.\n \nAnd even today in Scandinavia, Saturday is considered washing day... For all intents and purposes, the image of a fur clad bear of a man washing himself with his own spit and his own greasy beard is an absolutely false image of a Viking... If a Viking Age Scandinavian could afford to wash and groom himself, he would see to it that he looks like a respectable and handsome person.\n\nAs well, there is this:\n\n&gt; It is reported in the chronicle attributed to John of Wallingford that the Danes, thanks to their habit of combing their hair every day, of bathing every Saturday and regularly changing their clothes, were able to undermine the virtue of married women and even seduce the daughters of nobles to be their mistresses.\n\n[Source.](http://www.hillside.co.uk/arch/longmarket/comb.html)\n\n[As well, this comment by /u/EyeStache supports this.](http://ns.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gwnwf/ama_vikings/caolqcb)\n\n**EDIT:** It should be noted however, that Ahmed ibn Fadlan does describe the Volga Vikings as being unwashed barbarians, and that they *do* in fact, clean each other with their own spit, though he notes that they are obsessed with combing their hair. But we have to remember that this comes from the POV of a well standing nobleman from a very advanced and wealthy city (Baghdad), who was familiar with Islamic teachings on cleanliness, visiting traders who might not have had the chance to actually bathe. For all we know there was a great deal of cultural prejudice and bias. \n\nMy point here was also to debunk the entire myth of Viking uncleanliness in general.\n\nThis comment by /u/Vladith is also important and fascinating.\n\n&gt; Cultural bias plays a huge part, but consider that ibn Fadlan was writing back to an educated and literate society. His works were widely circulated in the Early Middle Ages, and it's possible he was writing what the readers in Damascus and Baghdad wanted to here. He goes out of his way to make them scary and foreign, so he builds up a reputation as \"the man who dealt with barbarians\".\nHe also goes into great detail about how the Vikings would gang-rape a woman multiple times a day before she is killed and thrown upon her master's funeral pyre. But not a single source mentions this elsewhere. It's a very gruesome detail, and one that Christian sources would be likely to mention. But they don't. I think it's possible that because female promiscuity was so abhorrent to medieval Muslims, ibn Fadlan made up a little sensationalistic tidbit to frighten readers at home and make them want more.\nIt's entirely possible that I am projecting modern values onto a premodern context and foreign culture, but I find it plausible that ibn Fadlan intentionally exaggerated and embellished his account of the Rus for the same reasons that Marco Polo exaggerated and embellished his account of the Chinese.\n___\n\n**VIKING PLATE ARMOUR, DOUBLE HANDED SWORDS AND LARPERS**\n\nSecond **the [clothing](http://i.imgur.com/w6VHlnE.jpg) [is](http://i.imgur.com/S14RUsW.jpg) [absolutely](http://i.imgur.com/6edXdor.jpg) [horrible.](http://i.imgur.com/8hbIPUw.jpg)** One of those guys is wearing a *kilt in the 10th century!* Why do they all look like LARP'ers?!

These guys would've been laughed out of a Medieval Fair the clothing is so shitty.\n\nA typical Scandinavian of that age would've settled with a [long tunic](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/tunic.jpg), [possibly a linen undertunic](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/undertunic.jpg) [trousers](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/trousers.jpg), [leg wraps](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/leg_wraps.jpg) and simple [shoes](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/shoes.jpg) of [varying](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/high_shoes.jpg) [design](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/pix/center_seam_shoe.jpg), depending on how rich you were.\n\nThe clothing of that age was also not as dull as some people imagine. Those who could afford it [would wear very colourful clothing.](http://imgur.com/a/HwZNC) The poorer Vikings [would've had less colourful clothing and i imagine mostly earthen or vegetable colours and dyes, if any at all.](http://imgur.com/a/kUsEI) Most people of that age probably would've wore undyed wool. Credit for the albums goes to /u/lokout.\n\nThe Vikings in this movie however, all wear scraps of black and brown leather, gray and white linen, black cloth and the like. It looks amateurish and for lack of a better term, kind of disgusting and unfinished,\n \nBut the absolute *biggest* kick to my nads is the armour (and also the reason for my flair). Oh boy... oh boy oh boy the armour.\n\nI'll just post the pictures:\n\n[1](http://i.imgur.com/Uel6p1k.jpg)\n\n[2](http://i.imgur.com/D78mBzx.jpg)\n\n[3](http://i.imgur.com/hfARO7x.jpg)\n\n[4](http://i.imgur.com/5G3v3fZ.jpg)\n\n[5](http://i.imgur.com/pZ5GgLi.jpg)\n\n[6](http://i.imgur.com/fUXXr22.jpg)\n\n[7](http://www.yourprops.com/movieprops/original/yp_5344eab228c3b1.02656942/The-13th-Warrior-Roneth-s-helmet-and-armor-2.jpg)\n\nOkay i think you get the picture.\n\nAbsolutely nothing about this armour is Medieval, or Viking or even *human* in some parts. They all look cobbled up approximations of fantasy armour and some are not rooted in any actual amrour the Viking Age Scandinavians had. One of those guys is wearing a fucking *morion* from the 16th century! The main character is wearing *plate* armour.\n\nIron and steel plates for use in armour really only came to existance in the Medieval Age in the 13th century, and went through several stages of development before coming to the image we most commonly think of when we think of plate armour. [I made this comment about this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bhqvm/rbadhistory_versus_the_epic_rap_batles_of/cj5hz9v)\n\nWe have few finds of Viking Age armour. Armour to begin with was expensive as Hell, and most people were probably outfitted simply, carrying a [shield](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/neck_to_knees.jpg) and possibly a padded jacket, called a gambeson.\n\nSince armour and weapons were expensive, whoever had the gear took great care of it and passed it on to his son and so forth and so forth.\n\nThe armour of the wealthy folk came down to a [knee lenght chainmail hauberk](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/t_mail.jpg) and helmets of varrying design:\n\n[1](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/norman_helm.jpg)\n\n[2](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/helm.jpg)\n\n[3](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/spectacle_helm.jpg)\n\n[4](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Vikinghjelm%2C_Gjermundbu.jpg/220px-Vikinghjelm%2C_Gjermundbu.jpg)\n\nAnother issue with the equippment in the movie is that all of them are carrying swords that are described as very heavy and some are wielded with two hands. Again this is playing into the stereotype of Vikings as incredibly muscular manly *berserkers*.\n\n[Replica of a Viking sword.](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/tapered_blade.jpg)\n\nFirst of all, again, swords were expensive as hell. \n\n&gt; More than anything else, the sword was the mark of a warrior in the Viking age. They were difficult to make, and therefore rare and expensive. The author of Fóstbræðra saga wrote in chapter 3 that in saga-age Iceland, very few men were armed with swords. Of the 100+ weapons found in Viking age pagan burials in Iceland, only 16 are swords.\n\n[Source.](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_sword.htm)\n\nMuch of the iron used in iron and steel production in Scandinavia either came from [bog iron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog_iron), or was imported from Frankish lands or taken during raids. So getting the iron and making the sword was difficult.\n\nSwords were a mark of prestige. However, you could make the case that the Vikings in the movie are simply accomplished warriors who engaged in countless raids and had boosted enough money and riches to afford making one (which was one way for a Scandinavian of that Age to get him some reasonable armour and weapons) so we could let it slide.\n\nThe bigger problem is that Viking swords [were](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/ulfberht1_grip.jpg) [one handed](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/sword_grip.jpg). There are no finds of double handed \n\nThey were also not really heavy. On average they weighed 2.4 lbs.\n\n**EDIT:** Most Viking Age Scandinavians of that time would've used [spears](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/spear_assortment.jpg). They're really cheap to make, repair and use and with enough skill can be used to *immense* effect. It can thrust, stab, slash, puncture and push away the enemy, keeping him away from you.\n\nNone of them also use [any](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/axe_assortment.jpg) [axes](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/axe_head.jpg), another incredibly cheap and easy to use weapon.... IAlong with the spear and a dagger, they were probably the most common Viking weapons (thank you /u/smileyman for reminding me to put this in, it completely flew over my head.\n\nOkay, i've gone long enough about the armour.\n_____\n\n**NONEXISTANT SWEDISH KINGS AND RAMSHACKLE BUILDINGS**\n\nOur anachronistic, barely approximate out of place Vikings and our Arab hero travel to their Northern homeland to help out King Hrothgar in his battle against the mysterious *Vendol* Terrifying enemies who are so feared that the Vikings dare not even speak their names. [They bare no relation towards the Vendol period.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendel_Period) \n\nSince Vendol is a parish in Sweden, are we supposed to believe this takes place in 10th Century Sweden?\n\nThe only Hrothgar i know of was a [legendary 6th Century Danish King...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrothgar). There are many legendary kings of Sweden who may or may not have existed, but not one of them is named Hrothgar.\n\nBut i'm not really suprised that the writers don't know shit and are extremely vague because of their ignorance towards the time period and culture represented.\n\nAnywho, our heroes reach this kingdom and we encounter what the conceptual designers and set designersbelieve [Scandinavian houses of the 10th Century looked like.](http://i.imgur.com/E9GODh6.jpg)\n\n[2](http://i.imgur.com/uEguCKm.jpg)\n\n\n[3](http://i.imgur.com/Ul3hbud.jpg)\n\nIn the Viking Age, most people lived in villages, populated by farmers\n\n&gt; ... the nature of these settlements varied widely from one region to another. In prosperous regions, farms tended to cluster into small villages or hamlets. In less prosperous areas, individual farms were well separated. In Iceland, farms were widely separated, and nothing like villages existed.\n\n&gt; Typical farm settlements took the form of a central cluster of buildings enclosed by fences. Outside the fenced areas were the fields used for cultivation or grazing. Each homestead typically consisted of a longhouse and multiple out-buildings.\n\n[Source](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Villages.htm)\n\nThe Viking farmer of that age would've lived with his whole family in a [longhouse](http://www.loreandsaga.free-online.co.uk/assets/images/new_longhouse_1.jpg) (the lenght and complexity depended on wealth and materials used). \n\n&gt; The longhouses were built around wooden frames on simple stone footings. Walls were constructed of planks, of logs, or of wattle and daub.\n\nThe houses in the movie all seem to be built *very* poorly and in some areas remind me more of Neolithic houses... and even *those* looked better than this.\n\nTheir positioning is also very hectic. Yes, villages of that age were small and as the tex quotes, clustered together. But i'm not sure if they were cluttered so closely together that i can't even tell where one farmers land begins and where the other farmers starts.\n\nAlso, for a King's land, it looks *incredibly* poor and poorly kept and cultivated.\n\nAnd then we see [The King's Longhouse...](http://i.imgur.com/QwA5tdH.jpg)\n\nI honestly don't know where Scandinavian Kings lived, but [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Borg_Vestv%C3%A5g%C3%B8y_LC0165.jpg) is a reconstruction of a Viking Chieftans longhouse. In comparison, this King's longhouse not only looks inaccurate, but also [much smaller and far less impressive.](http://i.imgur.com/WqNAf63.jpg)\n\n____\n\n**ATTACK OF THE KILLER VIKING PALEOLITHIC BEAR MEN OF SCANDINAVIA**\n\nYes despite how badass that sounds, it is obviously incredibly ridiculous and is basicaly on pseudo-historical fantasy.\n\nOur main heroes fight the Vendol, who dress themselves as bears and ride into villages, wielding torches and burning them down... for really no reason other than to kill and mutilate. In the movie, we aslo see that they carry [Venus figurines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines)\n\nThe Vikings believe them to be actual bear-men creatures, but in one battle, Banderas kills one, [revealing it's face to be that of a man.](http://i.imgur.com/zYQCNra.jpg). According to the Wiki page of the original novel, they are supposed to be relict Neanderthals.\n\nThe Venus idols have never been attributed to Neanderthals as far as i know, but the problem is that they exist in this movie in the first place. It goes without saying and it's not a suprise.... Paleolithic men/neanderthals probably did not survive to the 10th Century AD.\n\nAs well, in the movie the Vendol ride on horses.... They are later shown to live solely inside caves by the sea.... Where did they raise the horses? There are thousands of these Vendol living in these caves... where were the pastures that they needed to raise their horses for so many warriors? It makes no sense to me, but then again, nothing in this movie makes sense.\n\nSo there you have it, that's pretty much everything i wanted to say about it.\n\nAside from being batshit inaccurate and stupid to the core, it's an enjoyable popcorn movie with a good atmosphere... but loses it's charm upon repeated viewings.\n\nIn short it sucks.\n\nThank you for your time, i hope you enjoyed it, please offer some feedback, corrections and i'll see you around.",

My focus is in Modern Military Theory primarily and through that, my first love, the First World War. As you might imagine this field of study is filled with absolute geniuses who got a Total War or a History Channel history degree; you all may know them more succinctly as 'armchair generals' playing the hindsight game. This is just a general catharsis for me and anyone else who has an inkling of knowledge about the First World War and our collective experiences with those who know nothing but still feel the need to fill us with their bullshit wikipedia/hardcore history knowledge of tactics and operations. I'm hoping that, however, through this, I can get through to a few of y'all and you can learn something. Perhaps even greater this post could be used as a general reference guide when approached with these common WWI myths.\n\nSo let's start from the top boys! \n\n**1: Why in the ever living crap did they bother attacking? Why not just sit in their trenches all day? etc.**\n\n I want to predicate this section with [a map](http://fffaif.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/fromelles-map-7_sml-location-of-armies-on-the-western-front-30-june.jpg). This should give all the context I need. Look at that position and you see all the reasoning you need to attack. If the Germans punch through where the British and French lines meet the British will be entirely cut off and encircled -- pushed into the sea -- while the French would be rolled up from top to bottom. The French were obviously attacking because their country was being invaded and the only way to win was to push the enemy invader out of it and that required an offensive stance. The Germans needed to crush through those points to cause encirclement and generally needed to cause the capitulation of the French as to handle the Russians. An invasion requires offense. \n\nThus all three sides were in a situation where an offensive operational doctrine was required for not only military success but also aligning with political and public opinion.  Every day the Germans simply stayed in their trench was a day in which the ultimately goal of their efforts remained unfulfilled; every day in which their opponents stayed in their trenches was a day in which German occupation continued. This is an often overlooked part of the war but it needs to be said -- life behind German lines was not nice. It's easy to lose appreciation for the fact that there were millions of Belgians and Frenchmen in occupied German territory who were, by all accounts, being oppressed. Thousands would be shuttled to Germany into work camps. 20% of the Belgian population, 1.5/7 million, would be killed, injured, sent to a work camp, imprisoned, have to flee as refugees, or have all their worldly possessions confiscated/destroyed by the Germans. Let's not get it twisted -- the Entente forces were not just fighting a defensive war but a war of liberation of those who were conquered by an expansionist state and it showed in the attitudes of the soldiers.\n\nBack to the military stuff though. As the Germans were sent reeling back from the Marne and raced North during the Ainse they had the luxury of being a couple dozen kilometers into enemy territory. Thus they were quite content in giving up a few kilometers if it meant gaining a more defensible position. While they maintained an offensive stance they realized quickly the war they were now caught in and were preparing for it. Thus the Germans were perpetually on the higher ground in defensive positions of their own choosing. In a defensive sit still battle the Entente were thus always at risk. They were in the inferior position no matter what. This creates a conundrum which ties into the explanation above. If they sit back they are in inferior positions which are vulnerable to German attack constantly. The British in particular, as I mentioned before, were in no position to be reactionary to German moves but had to maintain pressure. The Germans were never allowed to be given the chance to seize initiative was the idea; they had to constantly be on the backfoot and the ones reacting. This meant, unfortunately, fighting a literal uphill battle.\n\nWith that said we can get to a more micro scale to deal with why just sitting around is a poor idea, mainly that of the hard numbers of casualties. Nearly 2/3rds of all casualties in the war were from artillery and most of that was when you were just sitting in your trench having a cup of tea or munching on a steak or something. Outside of this, and this is a topic I'll cover in much more depth later, the majority of trench life was not in grand assaults but in just sitting around. The threat of snipers and disease only shoot up if both sides take a sedentary doctrine. We see commonly the 'spirit of the offensive' used in a derisive way to describe French doctrine but really it is a justified mindset. While the British were not so keen on this they were more or less forced to do so out of their geographic position (see the above map) and in a reaction to the French's insistence on offensives. The two major British offensives of the war -- Somme and Passchendaele -- were reactionary offensives to deflect German pressure from Verdun and from the Nivelle mutinies respectively. \n\nFinally, as /u/NMW would aptly put it in one of his posts, training men in the art of killing and not giving them a chance to actually kill something is not the best choice of action. I have a book which I am basing a significant amount of this post on titled *\"Life in the British Trenches in the First World War\"* by Andy Simpson and let me make this abundantly clear -- the majority opinion was not that of the 'war poets' or of 'All Quiet on the Western Front.' Many men were ecstatic for the opportunity to actually get out of the trench and go attack the Germans and vice versa as sitting in the trenches and being shelled all day was not seen as attractive. The mindset which I see constantly in Simpsons work, which is basically all firsthand accounts, is one of that at least when they were attacking they were *doing something* and had some level of choice of their fate. I'd like to bring one Charles Edmonds to the stand specifically for this case:\n\n&gt; *I never could stand shell--fire. I got into a thoroughly neurotic state during the day. Enduring a bombardment is the opportunity for that kind of nervous disease which made Dr. Johnson touch every post as he walked along Fleet Street. You think of absurd omens and fetishes to ward off the shell you hear coming. . .*\n\n&gt; *So all the day you listened, calculated, hoped or despaired, making imaginary bargains with fate, laying odds with yourself on the chances of these various horrors. One particular gun would seem to be firing more directly on you than the others. You would wait for its turn so intently as to forget other perhaps more real dangers. At last it comes. You hold frenziedly on to the conversation; you talk a little too fast; your nerves grow tense, and while you continue to look and talk like a man, your involuntary muscles get a little out of hand. Are you knees quivering a little? Are you blinking? Is your face contorted with fear?* \n\n&gt; *You wonder and cannot know. Force yourself to do something, say something, think or something, or you will lose control. Get yourself in hand with some voluntary action. Drum out a tune with your finger-tips upon your knee. Don't hurry - keep time - get it finished and you will be safe this once. Here superstition and neurasthenia step in. Like the child who will not walk on the lines in the pavement and finds real safety in putting each foot on a square stone you feel your ritual protects you. As the roar of an approaching shell rises nearer and louder you listen in inward frenzy to the shell, in outward calm to the conversation. Steady with those nervous drum-taps on your knee; don't break time or the charm is broken and the augury vain. The shell roars near. What was Thorburn saying?*\n\n&gt; *\"Oh yes!\"*[sic]*, the rations come up at nine o'clock, enough for twice our numbers.\"*\n\nThis transitions nicely into my next section, \n\n**2: THE WAR WAS NOT SOME GRAND 24/7/365 OFFENSIVE AGAINST MACHINE GUNS**\n\nIn fact the majority of the war was sitting around doing fuck all. Conditions in the trenches were universally pretty shit to make it even worse. That is one universal thing that can be applied. Many trenches had water up the knees of men and you would have to wade around in this grungy, dirty mud water all day and everything you had would be almost constantly wet. When digging new trenches it was not uncommon to get a sudden and sharp scent of a dead body lying there for weeks or months as you pierced his flesh in the dirt, especially in when repairing trenches taken over from the enemy after large artillery barrages. Everything, once you got up to the front, had to be carried by hand for obvious reasons. Usually in the dark. In knee to waist high water. While being shot at by snipers consistently. You can imagine the frustration and how it could wear on a man. \n\nMany people like to bring up how men only served in front line trenches for about 7 days and would then cycle out to a rear trench to \"rest\" for a week or two, implying that life was cushy and more laid back than we think. They would generally not get such comfort, you did not escape the war and its horror. If you were on \"rest\" your job was generally to act as one of two jobs -- a runner or a supplier or in a worker party. A runner would have to run between communication trenches and the front line to deliver messages and vice versa. Since we didn't have trucks and armored vehicles of any kind all supplies would have to be delivered by hand. We're talking about food for tens of thousands of men stationed on the front line in a sector, and those on \"rest\" would have to do this.\n\nAs you approached the front delivering your steaks and rum and other rations it would likely be in the dead of night to shade you from snipers, which were a constant threat and you couldn't exactly be subtle lumbering around with goods. The darkness would not stop them from still popping off shots at you. The water would be knee high at least in more hot sectors and even up to the waist at times. It would not be that clear Hawaii water, it would be grungy, muddy, bloody water. You would have to negotiate these cramped, usually unfamiliar trench systems in pitch blackness all while carrying a couple dozen kilograms of rations while being under periodic sniper or machine gun fire. If you were in a \"quiet\" sector (ie: one of significant distance from enemy trenches) you replace \"sniper\" and \"machine gun\" with \"constant artillery shells around you\" and \"offensive patrols.\" \n\nYour job, all day, was to fortify your trench. Refilling sandbags (which didn't use sand but clay) and packing them in defensive positions. This is incredibly tedious. You will note that by putting sandbags in damaged or unfortified areas you are inherently exposing yourself as you lay them down. It was very nerve wracking. You would be clearing water out of your trench, digging up bodies and burying them, dealing with the smell and defecation of all types, and hiding in tiny holes whenever artillery barrages occurred. That or hitting the deck in that aforementioned grungy, muddy, bloody water when a snipers shot snapped right above your head and you were pinned down. Or crawling out over the top to lay down barbed wire to replace damaged sections. Note how the enemy had offensive patrols specifically designed to hunt people like you down who were reinforcing barbed wire fortifications which at times extended dozens of yards or even hundreds of yards out.\n\nYour actual day to day combat duties would include covering worker parties, going on patrols, and going on raids. Going on patrols basically meant walking out into no mans land with a handful of buddies and trying to scout out enemy positions without getting shot by a sniper or a machine gun or an enemy patrol. Being an offensive patrol meant you went and attacked enemy worker parties...who were being covered by hundreds of men and snipers and machine guns. Being a raid meant you and 100-500 of your buddies ran across no mans land and tried to capture prisoners in the enemy trench and then run back to your trench to interrogate them. As you might imagine, this is a pretty shitty experience overall. If you somehow managed to survive all these things trying to kill you, you would spend days and nights sleeping to the sound of artillery shells weighing hundreds of pounds at times blowing up a couple dozen yards from you and constant machine gun fire and eating wet steak and potatoes and drinking cheap rum. Then you get to cycle back a couple hundred yards back and spend the next week or two navigating the trenches and delivering supplies and messages all over again and maybe, just maybe, a few days out of the year you get a few days of legitimate rest.\n\nYes it sucked and yes it was, in my opinion after studying quite a bit of warfare, the absolute worst it got in human experience. It is my opinion that, if we really want to play this game, the First World War was a more psychologically brutal war than any other war in history for at least the Western Front and I will defend that until I die. However, with that said, the experience I described above does not align with the popular perception of the war of it being some constant shoulder to shoulder bayonet charge into machine guns. In fact Captain Geoffrey Bowen with the 2nd Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers on September 3rd, 1917 described his average daily experience in his journal. I'll be giving some context in brackets throughout for reading sake:\n\n    8.pm. Started [wake up]\n    9.30 p.m. Arrived.

Nonetheless there were exceptions and at times men did have to perform grand offensives into enemy positions so that should be discussed as it is a *huge* magnet for bad WWI history.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI feel I should clarify here as I may seem internally contradicting here when I say both sides took an offensive stance but most of the war was sitting around faffing around in the trenches and reinforcing. \"Offensive spirit\" would be encouraged, as I explained above, not through grand offensives which was my point but through more micro actions. Trench raids, offensive patrols, working party protections, standing to, etc. They wanted to keep the men active and to maintain a fighting spirit and keeping them from becoming sedentary. Through these more micro level operations along with artillery barrages both sides would maintain pressure on the other in conjunction with the occasional massive offensive in a certain sector. \n\nThat's really the major point though here -- while an offensive would be going on in say the Somme the rest of the British sectors would be seeing little to no action. While the French were focusing on Nivelle or Verdun the rest of their front was pretty quiet. So it was fast and explosive in small areas to maintain overall strategic pressure while the rest of the front and the majority of the men would just be living life as usual until they were cycled in for a few days of the fighting and then sent back.\n\nOn that note though...\n\n**3: \"Stupid tactics\"  / \"Human wave assaults\" / NO IT WASN'T THE FUCKING NAPOLEONIC WARS 2.0**\n\nI want to start this discussion with a quote:\n\n&gt; *A human wave attack is a pejorative term for an attack by massed infantry on a defended enemy position, intended to overwhelm the defenders by sheer weight of numbers and regardless of inevitable high casualties. The term implies both a lack of tactical subtlety by the attacker, and the defender's ability to inflict horrific casualties on the defender, usually through superior firepower, training or technology. It also suggests a callousness of the attacker towards its own troops, and therefore the term is likely to be used only by the defender or a later commentator; it is doubtful whether any attacker has ever used the term, or whether it has ever appeared in a tactical manual. Human wave tactics would normally only be used by an attacker who lacks firepower and the ability to maneuver, but whose main advantage is in numbers of men. His men may be poorly trained, though highly motivated: great physical courage and esprit de corps is required to advance unflinchingly into superior enemy fire.* \n\nThe phrase 'human wave tactics' is commonly used to describe mass assaults in WWI and I agree with the above author that \"pejorative\" is the best word to describe such an accusation. It is a word used post hoc to criticize those who we deem as too stupid or having been able to do something slightly better however it is a loaded phrase and lacks any nuance for how battle was actually conducted on the Western front. There are a couple things wrong right off the bat with this accusation and that is that human wave tactics are an inherently decisive maneuver. They are a tool by a numerically superior force to cause an immediate and decisive route of the enemy as that is the only advantage they possess (or one of the few relevant ones). It is not, however, conducive to attrition styled warfare on a micro or macro scale. British training manuals and Kitchner's \"New Army\" in 1915/16 were trained thoroughly in fire and maneuver tactics contrary to popular belief. Small level warfare was encouraged by all means and it was how war was fought for almost 50 years by this point.\n\nThe thing many people don't realize is that these lessons were learned in 1870/71 by the French and Germans and the rest of Europe alike. No, men were not marching in lockstep shoulder to shoulder with bayonets extended in some glorious charge \"Napoleonic style\". The Franco-Prussian War was the war which saw the first widespread use of skirmishing tactics and what popularized it for armies across Europe. The crash course of how infantry would arrange itself in this time was that men would be organized into what are called 'skirmishing lines'. Each man would be given approximately 10 feet of space (2-3 meters) on either side and this would extend 60-70 men wide and two ranks deep, each rank separated by about 25 yards or so. 150-ish yards back the remainder of the battalion would be in column formation and would send up men in 'waves', usually platoon sized, to reinforce the skirmishing line. These men would be given free reign to take cover, duck and dodge and dive as they saw fit yet they were still close enough that they could mutually support each other and receive auditory signals of assault, retreat, reform, quick pace, etc. \n\nYet the WWI badhistory armchair general fuckface would like to tell me that the French and Germans alike, who tore apart each other with these formations, suddenly went back to shoulder to shoulder Napoleonic styled charges? Even with these skirmishing tactics a company Prussian would experience 68% casualties at Mars-la-Tour with similar casualty rates across the board for everyone else. They understood how deadly infantry fire was and more importantly the power of artillery. The Franco-Prussian War was a war won and lost by strategic and operational success at mobilization and massive artillery bombardments. See any similarities to the massive artillery focus in WWI and the German war plan hinging on a rapid mobilization and strategic outplaying of the French? WWI was a replication of the Franco-Prussian War more than the Napoleonic Wars. \n\nEven that is a shitty analogy though because it was so much more; WWI would grow into its own beast even by 1915. Flamethrowers, barbed wire hundreds of meters deep, gas attacks, subterranean mining and bombing, trench knives and [coshes](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/BLW_Coshes_and_bludgeon.jpg), shotguns and later machine pistols, massive use of grenades, A LOT OF GRENADES, mortars, hatchets, portable machine guns, tanks, aerial bombings, and radio made it its own unique beast. Through this the new doctrine falls into place. To quote Robert Doughty directly:\n\n&gt; *\"With belts of enemy defenses to cross, an offensive, Joffre believed, should consist of a series of carefully controlled attacks, advancing from objective to objective after prepatory fires by the artillery. As the infantry moved by bounds, artillery batteries would displace forward to ensure continued firing against enemy positions. The launching of successive attacks thus presented the characteristic of prepatory fires, followed by an infantry attack, followed by forward displacement of artillery batteries to provide prepatory fires against the next German positions, followed by another infantry attack.\"*^[1]\n\nAfter the 1915 'growing pains' the French manuals would update:\n\n&gt; *\"No longer focusing on holding specific terrain, doctrine strongly emphasized the effectiveness of 'rapidly executed and energetically conducted' counterattacks.\"*^[2]\n\nThis really encapsulates warfare in WWI in my opinion -- counterattacks. Taking the first trench or even the first few was not difficult *at all*. Most offensives would actually be initially successful on a micro scale; it was holding the trench that was the issue for the duration of the war. The French and Germans alike were keen on providing only a thin layer of defense and basically giving away the first few trenches, cutting off enemy reinforcements with artillery, and then performing massive counter attacks against the attritioned attackers. This was basically a necessity for how warfare was to be fought at the time principally because of a basic tenant of trench warfare -- it is impossible to fortify every position at once and in any way equally. You have a screening force up front and a large force in reserve. When the enemy plays their hand you throw your reserves into that sector and beat them off and go back. In this would not be massive formation based warfare or cavalry charges or 'running into machine guns' but close and personal fighting. \n\nLastly there is one unique style of warfare to the Western front and that is subterranean conflict. While tunnels are still used to this day and were used in some limited fashion in the American Civil War the First World War would see an absolutely enormous reliance on them like never before. At the Messines Ridge alone, *one* small ridge in the Ypres region which was just a mini-offensive to build up to the massive Passchendaele offensive, had 2000+ **miles** of subterranean tunnels dug between 1915 and June 1917 with over 450 tonnes -- 1,000,000 pounds -- of explosives laid about 100+ feet under the German trenches. The largest single cache would be near St-Eloi by the 1st Canadian Tunneling Company which held 95,600 pounds of ammonal and was 125 feet below the German trenches. For those 18 months the British and Germans alike would be fighting in cramped chest high tunnels in near pitch blackness with only handheld lanterns to guide their way in a new style of warfare that had never before been tried. *Camouflets* were used by the Germans to collapse tunnels and a new style of war, literally burying men alive 150 feet underground, would be undertaken by the Germans. \n\nOn the 21st of May the preliminary bombardment by about 2500 guns would begin firing 24 hours a day 7 days a week until the 7th of June at 2:50 in the morning. Hearing the silence, thus signifying an enemy assault, the Germans threw the weight of their reserves to the Messines defenses as they manned their machine guns and firing positions in a half hour of silence while sending up hundreds of flares (also a new development allowing night time fighting) to get a read on British advancements. They got no British assault. At 3:10 19 of the 21 explosives, the last two malfunctioning, would detonate in what witnesses described as 19 separate mushroom clouds. Multiple independent accounts in Dublin and London report having heard the blast and it was and is the largest manmade non-nuclear explosion in human history. The explosives would detonate at 3:10:00 AM and there would be 10,000 dead Germans at 3:10:01 AM; most would be vaporized instantly, others would be crushed. The remaining 7,000 Germans who survived the initial blast would be so disoriented from the blast that they would not even resist the Entente assault and surrender immediately upon contact or be dug out of the rubble.\n\nSo please, do fucking tell me what about what I just described above, **one** (albeit the largest) example of one relatively small aspect of the art of war in WWI (subterranean fighting), at all reflects Napoleonic warfare assholes. God I'm sorry but this shit just frustrates me to no end. That is just one god damn example of an aspect of warfare and it sounds nothing like *anything* that had ever come before it. Tell me how the trench fighting and the maneuver warfare was anything Napoleonic you chucklefucks. This was an incredibly unique era of warfare where many of what would be used would not even be used again as technology changed so much. It's such a unique and amazing case study of warfare but so many people want to reduce it to *\"oh it's like Napoleonic warfare but...\"* or *\"Well this is what's relevant to WW2 warfare...\"* and that's *a load of fucking bullshit.*\n\n**Lions led by Donkeys A.K.A. No the Somme was not a failure A.K.A. \"Haig the Butcher\"**\n\nProbably the most unfortunate thing about the study of WWI is the writings of regular soldiers following the war and their popularity. Too many people have only the experience of these writings w.r.t. these conflicts but not a more removed, objective stance we can now have 100 years later. This was a period in which the average man was critical (to put it lightly) of the higher ups as they could not cope with the significant loss of human life. These attitudes would be popularized and normalized in Western culture and the star player in this smear campaign was the Somme as it was the greatest loss of life of the war for both the British and the Germans. However with the benefit of retrospect we can confidently make a more objective case. This is my last topic I want to cover because it is one that is a lot more reasonable for people to believe in because of how the war is taught in general but one I still feel is necessary to teach. I'm about to ruin an experience I had in the purest sense and I know I share with other First World War aficionados and that is learning the reality of the Somme as it not being some horrendous failure but in just about every respect a strategic and operational success for the British and the entire Entente war effort. \n\nTo understand this first though we must realize there was no other option. It was either perform this offensive or lose the war. In early 1916 the French would be attacked at Verdun and the British would be left totally alone for their previously planned Somme offensive. The plan would now have to change though; the British could no longer rely on significant French support in their upcoming offensive, they would be totally alone. To make matters worse, as said above, France was losing that battle. The British were told straight up if they don't start the offensive immediately and relieve German pressure there won't be a French army left at the end of 1916. Considering the French took up a significant majority of the front this was seen as a problem. The Somme had thus turned from part one in a two part plan to squeeze the Germans into submission but into a desperation rescue mission to relieve German pressure in Verdun and give the French a chance to collect themselves. \n\nIt was, by most accounts, a success as I said before. Detractors will commonly point to the first day of the Somme which saw 20,000 dead and 40,000 injured for the British but we must remember that, overall, the offensive lasted for about **5 months** and in that time those numbers would even out. As much as I hate playing the numbers game it is one that does fall in favor of the Entente as the attackers: 400,000 Commonwealth casualties (~330,000-350,000 British, the rest Australian, Canadian, Kiwi and Indian) and of that 100,000 dead, 200,000 French casualties, and 600,000 German casualties and of that 160,000 dead. They would be almost equal with the British alone taking almost *half* of the total losses of the Germans. \n\nOn a more grounded level just look [at the territorial gain.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Battle_of_the_Somme_1916_map.png) It would be the greatest territorial gain of the war since September 1914; 6 miles of penetration would be attained from the fighting. Most importantly however was that it ripped initiative from the Germans which was never to be regained; the Somme was when the Germans had effectively lost the war. They gained it in February that year but the Somme would put them on the perpetual defensive for the remainder of 1916 and 1917, only to be temporarily reinvigorated in 1918 for a last ditch all in offensive which would fail shortly. The Somme *terrified* the German high command. They could not suffer another Somme under the current conditions without capitulating. They would thus begin construction of a massive defensive fortification called the *Siegfriedstellung*, the Hindenburg Line. It was a massive defensive 'line in the sand' with, literally, barbed wire fields hundreds of meters deep and support trenches and tunnels and concrete pillboxes and so forth. It was a force to be reckoned with. In early 1917 the Germans would [withdrawal to this line](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Operation_Alberich%2C_March%2C_1917.jpg) called Operation Alberich which ceded even more territory to the Entente forces. The policy of offense had, in the end, worked. It put the Germans who in 1914 and 1915 and even 1916 were in position to seize initiative and crush the French and British on the perpetual backfoot and allowed the Entente, with all their manpower and their blockades, to squeeze the Germans dry.\n\n----------------\n\nNotes:\n\n*The Marne: The Opening of World War I*, Holger Herwig\n\n*The First Day on the Somme*, Martin Middlebrooks\n\n*The Kaisers Battle*, Martin Middlebrooks\n\n*Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War*, Robert Doughty\n\n*Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front*, Richard Holmes\n\n*Through German Eyes: The British &amp; The Somme 1916*, Christopher Duffy\n\n*\"Hot Blood &amp; Cold Steel: Life and Death in the Trenches of the First World War\"*, Andy Simpson\n\n^[1] Doughty, 254\n\n^[2] *Note pour les commandats de groupe d'armees*, 5 decembre 1915",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hi8ea/lets_read_10k_year_explosion_scientific/",
        "text": "So I picked up Cochran and Harpending's *The 10,000 Year Explosion* based on a very vague description, thinking it might be relevant to a project I'm working on. I didn't realize that it was made of bad history (and some bad science) until I started reading. Here is just a small part of it, from the chapter I just finished (ch. 4).\n\nIn this section, Cochran and Harpending attempt (poorly) to demonstrate that the scientific and industrial revolutions were caused by some kind of genetic influence. I'm just going to talk about the scientific revolution here.\n\n&gt;Jared Diamond observed in *Guns, Germs, and Steel* that “the nations rising to new power are still ones that were incorporated thousands of years ago into the old centers of dominance based on food production, or that have been repopulated by people from those centers.... Prospects for world dominance of sub-Saharan Africans, Aboriginal Australians, and Native Ameri-cans remain dim. The hand of history’s course at 8000 BC lies heavily on us.”26 But what kind of experience are we talking about? Diamond asserts that such differences were entirely cul-tural, that is to say, learned-but if this were so, populations that missed out on these experiences could in principle catch up rapidly. After all, culture is learned anew every generation, so presumably new technologies and new forms of social organiza-tion that had proved successful in other countries could be adopted over two or three generations, just as most farmers in\nmany countries have become city dwellers over a few genera-tions. Yet economists have shown that the age of the transition to agriculture appears to have a strong influence on a country’s economic development in recent decades, even after control-ling for many other factors.” It’s hard to see how this could be due to cultural effects. Even if a nation could learn from expe-riences their ancestors had back in the Bronze Age and benefit from them (which sounds unlikely), why can’t everyone else learn those same lessons? Why would those experiences confer a relative advantage? On the other hand, genetic changes that accommodated people to a dense hierarchical society could eas-\nily have developed over those millennia, and genetic informa-tion can’t easily be transferred -- yet.\n\nSo if the economic studies are true, isn't that just evidence of a greater accumulation of technology and knowledge by societies that adopted agriculture earlier? How does that force us into some biological interpretation?\n\nOn the next point, both Diamond and C&amp;H seem to have a really strange view of cultural change. New forms of social organization are not usually adopted within a couple of generations unless a revolution of some kind occurs. It also totally ignores that it's not the case that people are always trying to adopt some new technology or social organization and just can't do it. Many *resist* adopting these things. That's why there were social engineering projects targeted at indigenous populations with the intent of assimilation, like the boarding schools built for Native Americans in the US. And even in this example, the Native Americans who did resist were adopting European technology (i.e., guns) to use against the Europeans. They weren't sitting around saying \"Gosh darnit, White Man keeps teaching me how to use boom sticks and capitalism, but I just don't understand.\"\n\nMoving on, the next section explains how genetic change could occur rapidly enough that the time frame they're talking about wouldn't be too short for natural selection to occur. I don't have any expertise in genetics or molecular anthropology, but this seems plausible enough, I guess. So I'll take this for granted.\n\nNow they go on to argue that natural selection favored certain traits such that they became more frequent in the human population.\n\n&gt;Science as we know it got its official start in Europe in the sixteenth century with the publication of Copernicus’s work De revolutioniéus in 1543. The closest thing to modern science seen before that would have been the protoscience practiced by the Greek and, later, Arab civilizations-but they’re not that close. The productivity and intensity of modern science far outshines earlier efforts. Some of the most important European scien-tists, such as Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, and Charles Darwin, made larger intellectual contributions as individuals than other entire civilizations did over a period of centuries.\n\nCopernicus' publication is a pretty arbitrary date. If we actually wanted to go with an \"official\" date, it would be 1833 when William Whewell coined the term \"scientist.\" But this paragraph just takes it for granted that the concept of a \"scientific revolution\" is not contested. It just ignores the [\"continuity thesis\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_thesis), that there may have been no sharp break between Medieval science and early modern science.\n\nNext they talk about science as a social enterprise. So far so good, until...\n\n&gt;You see, there can also be phase transitions in connectivity. Imagine that the average budding scientist in Europe in 1450 knew a few other people like himself. Those acquaintances knew others, but since such people were rare, the potential scientists of Europe fell into small, isolated groups rather than a single con-nected community. There was no efficient way for new ideas and discoveries to spread. We are positing that as the frequency of such people increased, there was a sharp transition at a certain critical value. Suddenly all groups connected, and there was a path between any two members. Something similar happens in epidemiology: If the number and density of vulnerable individ-uals exceeds a certain threshold, the infectious disease is certain to spread to the entire community. Below that threshold, the disease is confined to a small cluster of people and dies out.\n\nIt's almost like the Medieval university system didn't exist before 1450! Natural philosophers were just sitting around until there were enough genetic *ubermenschen* to form a sufficiently large social network.\n\n&gt;Thus, the scientific “revolution” may well have resulted from modest changes in gene frequencies affecting key psychological traits. What traits would have favored the birth of science? In-creases in abstract reasoning or numerical abilities might have helped, and it’s possible that those traits were favored by selec-tion in complex, hierarchical societies. Generally, though, we think there was no direct selection favoring creativity itself, and\nthat creative individuals are accidental by-products of selection for other traits, traits that really did pay off in everyday life, such as low time preference and the ability to make complex mental models.\n\nHard to debunk this, because there's nothing there. There are no studies, genetic or otherwise, that are given to back up these claims.\n\nThere is a divergence on poets and manic-depression, and then they get back on-topic.\n\n&gt;Technical and social factors must have been important in increasing social connectivity: Better transportation, regular\nmail services, and the printing press, for example, played essen-tial roles. Although inventions such as the printing press were undoubtedly important, they seem to have been necessary rather than sufficient, since science either does not exist or is appallingly feeble in the majority of the world’s populations, even among those that have access to those favorable technological factors. If a region or population produces major advances in knowledge,\nscience there is real and alive, otherwise not. By that standard, science does not exist in sub-Saharan Africa or in the Islamic world today. As Pervez Hoodbhoy (head of the physics depart-ment in Islamabad) has written, “No major invention or discov-ery has emerged from the Muslim world for well over seven\ncenturies now.”30\n\nSo this supposed lack of science is flawed in two ways. One is by arbitrarily defining science during the so-called Golden Age of Islam as not \"real\" science. The other is ignoring any historical conditions entirely. What would have happened if the Mongols didn't invade the Middle East in the 13th century? Perhaps science might have continued advancing in the region. And, of course, they totally ignore colonialism. Centuries of political instability, oppression, and poverty in these regions is hardly conducive to large-scale scientific research.\n\nAnd, that's all folks! The scientific revolution has been \"explained\"! Seriously, this book needs a full-scale GGS-style dissection. Maybe a collaboration between r/badhistory and r/badscience.",

After all as mentioned before, one is an aerial ramming tactic made to inflict as much damage as possible and the other was an infantry charge that revolved around disrupting enemy advances by closing in the distance and inflicting as much damage as possible. The idea behind it is *technically* the same, but to say they were identical and mix the words together is misguided at best.\n\nThe BH in question: [A small but very wrong comment.](http://imgur.com/3pOXBRl)\n\nSources (mostly wiki since I was lazy):\n\n1.

        "text": "Just came across the following comment in an AskReddit thread that has some minor bad history in it. In response to a question asking who in history lived the highest quality life, a redditor gave this original reply:\n\n&gt;Historical: Louis XIII. King of France, lives every day lounging around, hunting, entertaining and eating gourmet meals in fucking Versailles, one of the nicest places ever built. \n\n\nThis isn't horrible, as Louis XIII as a French monarch certainly did live a very comfortable lifestyle. But to suggest that his spending time in Versailles was done in \"one of the nicest places ever built\" is in error.\n\nVersailles existed as a village prior to becoming what we know it to be today, but it was not the seat of the Court until Louis XIII's successor, Louis XIV, moved it there. It was only after massive expansions on an existing chateau that it would've become suitable for long-term habitation for a monarch, especially one trying to carry the image of absolutism that we associate Louis XIV with.\n\nLouis XIII did begin the trend that led to this, but the land was designated as a retreat for hunting, and not a palace. He first visited Versailles in 1607 as the dauphin, being taken there by his father Henri IV on a hunting trip. After certain visits, Louis built a hunting lodge that consisted of a somewhat simple building with a wing on either side, drawn [here.](http://www.maquettes-historiques.net/V6.jpg) It had a total of five rooms and wasn't particularly impressive in its decor, at least by the standards that anyone would expect for a palace—hence the bad history. This was constructed ca. 1624, and it took another eight years before Louis XIII would permanently acquire the land and begin expansions to the chateau, with the original plan as the foundation. Two additional wings had since been added around the time Louis XIV began expanding the palace, and ca. 1662 looked like [this.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Palace_of_Versailles.gif) It's obviously a very stately structure by this time, but certainly isn't something that commands the sort of awe that would go along with \"one of the nicest places ever built,\" though I'm on mobile now and hope someone can expand on how it would've compared to the Louvre or other royal residences at this period. I know around the end of the seventieth century Whitehall Palace would've exceeded it in size, so even well into its expansion it's not quite paralleled even the residence of the English monarchs. Under Louis XIV it underwent four separate building campaigns that resulted in very drastic expansion, the Court slowly starts gravitating around the palace as time goes on, in 1682 becomes the permanent seat of the Court, and by 1722 (after Louis' fourth building campaign), it's looks like [this.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Schloss-Versailles.jpg) By that point it can rightly be said to be one of the most elaborate palaces in Europe—and in fact long before that. But it was under the reign of Louis XIV that this becomes true.",

One of the people I carpool with happens to be a Tea Party Libertarian if that's any guess, so he has given the usual State's Rights, Abrahama Lincoln was basically Hitler yadda yadda but today he pulled in some bad history or US political parties, starting with their formation.\n\n&gt;The Republican party was actually founded by abolitionists, but Democrats wanted to keep slavery.\n\nOk, not really wrong so far. But, you can guess where he's going to go with this.\n\n&gt;Historically it's the democrats that didn't want to grant equal rights to black people.\n\nWell, yes and no. In the beginning, yes, but Republican and Democratic parties today are definitely not the same as they were back then and their platforms largely switched before 1930 (I can't remember the actual rough date, but I know it was definitely well before New Deal liberalism.)\n\n&gt;Republicans were the ones that voted for desegregation, but democrats wanted to keep it.\n\nNow this one is just flat out wrong. It's a favorite to point out that the percentage of Democrats that voted \"no\" on the Civil Rights act was greater than the percentage of Republicans. But it's important to keep in mind that the number of elected democrats was well above the elected Republicans. In fact, we actually end up with an example of Simpson's paradox.\n\nWhen we look at just \"Republicans vs. Democrats\" 80% of Republicans were in favor of the Civil Rights Act and only 61% of Democrats were. So Republicans were the ones largely voting for it, right? Well actually, turns out almost all of the opposition was coming from *southern* Democrats. In fact, if we break it down, Southern Democrats voted in favor of desegregation at 7% but *none* of the southern Republicans voted for it. As well, 94% of Northern Democrats voted for the Civil Rights Act, whereas only 85% of the Northern Republicans voted for it.\n\nSo, even though put together it seems the percentage was lower for Democrats, when split up, Republicans had the lower percentages. So, saying Republicans were the ones that voted for it is misleading at best.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2herl0/small_mistakes_on_anarchism_in_a_yale_lecture/",
        "text": "So, I was watching [this Yale lecture series on French history](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE653BF062C136B62) and, when we got to [the lecture on leftist parties and socialists in France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNZf75jGe_I&amp;list=PLE653BF062C136B62&amp;index=7) and [the lecture on anarchism and propaganda by the deed in France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGsoiE3zQQ&amp;list=PLE653BF062C136B62&amp;index=8), I noticed some errors made by the teacher.\n\nNow, before I continue, a lot of the French parts of the history are, to my knowledge, impeccable. The lecturer's mistakes are with the broader anarchist movement. He is obviously very well educated and well versed on the history of France in the time period he speaks of.\n\nAnyway, I'll start with the first one. In this one, he makes mistakes speaking about syndicalism.\n\nThe first mistake I identified was about 36:45 into the video. Here he asserts that Georges Sorel came up with the idea of the General Strike. In fact, the General Strike was formulated by William Benbow, a Chartist^(1), though he referred to it as a Grand National Holiday. However, some Chartists did implement the General Strike in 1842 and it looked very similar to what syndicalists would later advocate for^(2). Sorel did speak of the General Strike^(3), but it was taking an existing concept, not creating a new one.\n\nNow, moving on to the second video, he makes many more mistakes than in the first, though still not that many.\n\nFirst, about 1:05 in, he states that Proudhon was the first anarchist. This isn't really true. At the very least, William Godwin proceeded him, writing anarchistic ideas in the 1790s^(4) and Josiah Warren who was writing in the early 1800s and created anarchist communities in the 1840s and the 1850s.\n\nAt about 1:25, he falsely claims that Proudhon wrote a pamphlet called \"Property Is Theft\". The pamphlet was actually called \"What Is Property?\" and the most famous line from it is \"Property is theft\"^(5).\n\nOk, so, at 3:30, he claims that Kropotkin was among those who came up with the term \"propaganda of the deed\", but I haven't found any evidence that Kropotkin actually used that term at all. It is true that Kropotkin, at one point, did argue for something that basically was \"propaganda of the deed,\" but he never actually calls it that^(6).\n\nFinally, at 10:45ish, he contrast Kropotkin and Proudhon with those who advocated the propaganda of the deed. He clarifies with Kropotkin enough that it stays out of bad history for him, but he doesn't do so with Proudhon. Proudhon actually formulated something very similar to propaganda of the deed himself in an unpublished work which we only have part of today and has only recently been translated^(7), so, while he is wrong to place Proudhon as separate from those who advocated the propaganda of the deed, it's probably not his fault because the work where Proudhon does advocate that was translated just this year, so he was probably basing this off of the information he had which wouldn't have included that.\n\nAnyway, that's the extent of my objections. Other than those small mistakes, this is a pretty wonderful lecture series.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes:\n\n^1 ^He ^formulated ^it ^in ^the ^pamphlet ^*Grand* ^*National* ^*Holiday* ^*and* ^*Congress* ^*of* ^*the* ^*Productive* ^*Classes* ^in ^which ^he ^says ^\"A ^holiday ^signifies ^a ^holy ^day, ^and ^ours ^is ^to ^be ^of ^holy ^days ^the ^most ^holy. ^It ^is ^to ^be ^most ^holy, ^most ^sacred, ^for ^it ^is ^to ^be ^consecrated ^to ^promote- ^to ^create ^rather- ^the ^happiness ^and ^liberty ^of ^mankind. ^Our ^holy ^day ^is ^established ^to ^establish ^plenty, ^to ^abolish ^want, ^to ^render ^all ^men ^equal! ^In ^our ^holy ^day ^we ^shall ^legislate ^for ^all ^mankind; ^the ^constitution ^drawn ^up ^during ^our ^holiday, ^shall ^place ^every ^human ^being ^on ^the ^same ^footing. ^Equal ^rights, ^equal ^liberties, ^equal ^enjoyments, ^equal ^toil, ^equal ^respect, ^equal ^share ^of ^production: ^this ^is ^the ^object ^of ^our ^holy ^day ^– ^of ^our ^sacred ^day, ^– ^of ^our ^festival!\" ^He ^calls ^it ^a ^\"Grand ^National ^Holiday\" ^in ^which ^all ^of ^the ^working ^class ^refuse ^to ^work ^and ^create ^their ^own ^committees ^for ^their ^own ^management ^and ^stuff.\n\n^2 ^It ^was ^more ^complicated ^than ^simply ^the ^Chartists ^deciding ^to ^do ^a ^General ^Strike. ^It ^was ^decided ^upon ^in ^two ^mass ^meetings ^of ^workers ^who ^wanted ^to ^do ^a ^\"Grand ^National ^Turn-Out\" ^which ^was ^modeled ^after ^Benbow's ^Grand ^National ^Holiday ^and ^inspired ^by ^the ^Chartists. ^In ^addition, ^13 ^of ^the ^15 ^leaders ^of ^the ^strike ^were ^Chartists. ^However, ^it ^wasn't ^actually ^organized ^by ^Chartist ^leaders ^and ^they ^only ^hopped ^on ^board ^after ^it ^was ^under ^way. ^[Source.](http://www.chartists.net/general-strike-1842.htm)\n\n^3 ^To ^Sorel, ^the ^General ^Strike ^was ^a ^myth ^to ^inspire. ^To ^him, ^no ^revolution ^could ^be ^successful ^without ^some ^sort ^of ^myth ^to ^inspire ^them. ^Indeed, ^to ^him, ^myths ^are ^things ^that ^the ^people ^strive ^to ^create, ^and, ^thus, ^without ^them ^they ^aren't ^going ^to ^accept ^any ^socialistic ^ideas. ^To ^quote ^him, ^\"As ^long ^as ^there ^are ^no ^myths ^accepted ^by ^the ^masses, ^one ^may ^go ^on ^talking ^of ^revolts ^indefinitely, ^without ^ever ^provoking ^any ^revolutionary ^movement; ^this ^is ^what ^gives ^such ^importance ^to ^the ^general ^strike ^and ^renders ^it ^so ^odious ^to ^socialists ^who ^are ^afraid ^of ^a ^revolution.\" ^[Source](http://www.historyguide.org/europe/sorel.html) ^So, ^to ^him, ^the ^proletariat ^need ^a ^myth ^to ^focus ^on ^for ^the ^words ^of ^revolutionaries ^to ^convince ^them ^to ^revolt.\n\n^4 ^Godwin ^wrote ^*Enquiry* ^*concerning* ^*Political* ^*Justice,* ^*and* ^*its* ^*Influence* ^*on* ^*General* ^*Virtue* ^*and* ^*Happiness* ^in ^which ^he ^argues ^that ^anarchism ^\\(though ^it ^didn't ^have ^a ^name ^at ^the ^time, ^will ^be ^the ^end ^result ^of ^human ^progress ^and ^be ^moral ^as ^it ^would ^create ^the ^greatest ^happiness ^for ^all.\n\n^5 ^He ^then ^goes ^on ^to ^claim ^that ^Proudhon ^meant ^only ^too ^much ^property ^or ^unearned ^property ^is ^theft, ^not ^all ^property, ^but ^this, ^too, ^is ^false, ^but ^less ^of ^a ^historical ^misstep, ^so ^I'm ^relegating ^my ^objection ^to ^it ^to ^my ^footnotes. ^Anyway, ^what ^Proudhon ^really ^meant ^was ^that ^property ^has ^not ^lived ^up ^to ^what ^it ^has ^promised ^and ^has, ^instead, ^lived ^up ^to ^what ^the ^supporters ^would ^call ^theft. ^So, ^property ^*in* ^*practice* ^was ^what ^the ^proponents ^of ^property ^called ^theft ^*in* ^*theory*. ^He'd ^go ^on ^to ^call ^property ^\"liberty\" ^and ^\"impossible\" ^and, ^in ^his ^later ^years, ^constitute ^a ^new ^and ^different ^property ^system ^that ^wouldn't ^be ^theft.\n\n^6 ^What ^he ^does ^say ^which ^I ^think ^is ^what ^the ^lecturer ^is ^referring ^to ^is, ^\"By ^actions ^which ^compel ^general ^attention, ^the ^new ^idea ^seeps ^into ^people's ^minds ^and ^wins ^converts. ^One ^such ^act ^may, ^in ^a ^few ^days, ^make ^more ^propaganda ^than ^thousands ^of ^pamphlets.\" ^He ^never ^actually ^calls ^that ^\"propaganda ^of ^the ^deed\", ^though. ^[Source](http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/spiritofrevolt.html)\n\n^7 ^You ^can ^find ^the ^work ^in ^question ^[here](http://contrun.libertarian-labyrinth.org/avengers-who-never-assemble/) ^with ^some ^commentary ^by ^the ^translator.",

Thomas Lincoln looked nothing like Abe, and stood only 5'10''.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2h8w16/til_that_president_abraham_lincolns_father_thomas/ckqxug4)\n\n[For those unfamiliar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/inside_jokes#wiki_.2Fu.2Fdrooperdoo_and_king_edward_viii.27s_time_machine)\n\n(It's also noteworthy that coachbradb is in that thread as well, but this time actually saying something somewhat reasonable.)\n\nIt is true that there are rumors of this being true. There are actually rumors that Lincoln was the son of four different Abraham Enlo(w/e)s, most commonly Abe Enloe of Rutherford County, North Carolina—the other three were Kentuckians, I believe, which sort of only adds to the absurdity of this whole deal. I'm assuming that Droopy is referring to the NC Enloe.\n\nWhy is this bad history? Well, aside from the fact that we need a little more than circumstantial evidence about refused DNA testing and height disparities, droopy is presenting this as plausible in spite of it being discredited by pretty much every Lincoln biographer, and laughable to anyone who knows much about Lincoln.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is the implausibility of there being an arrangement between Thomas Lincoln and Abraham Enloe based on geography alone. We know from various public records that Thomas Lincoln was in Kentucky (specifically Hardin County, in and around Elizabethtown) in 1804, when this arrangement is supposed to have taken place (which changes the age of Pres. Lincoln five years). This would essentially mean that Enloe would have to have traveled from N. Carolina to Kentucky around 1804, and we have no evidence for that having occurred, let alone reason to suspect that anybody would do that (presumably) to the end of dumping his kid onto Thomas for the sake of living a better life, when he could've just done that in N. Carolina. We also have no evidence that places Thomas in N. Carolina at any point, and we have records that trace his movement throughout his life from Virginia to Kentucky to Indiana to Illinois, and never to N. Carolina as these folks sometimes suggest. \n\nThis is made even more problematic because, as the story goes, Enloe paid Lincoln a sum of money to actually marry Nancy Hanks, when the records we have of this date their marriage to 1806. We know that Hanks was in Kentucky as well in 1806, while there is (less compelling) evidence that places her in Kentucky between 1803-1805 as well, which is only substantiated by the fact that it accurately predicts where we can locate her in 1806 with the first solid record we have of Hanks, which is her marriage to Lincoln on June 12 of that year. If she was the biological mother of Abe Lincoln, then we would sort of need evidence of her being in N. Carolina when Lincoln was supposed to have been born according to this theory, and we don't. There is no evidence of her marrying Thomas earlier, so if the story about Enloe's arrangement were true, then we'd have to wonder why it took them so long to actually respect Enloe's request, and why nobody seemed to notice that they already had a two year-old child.\n\nThere's also the problem of Lincoln and Hanks having another child in 1807, Sarah, Lincoln's older sister of two years. It's difficult to believe that Lincoln would pass for two years younger than Sarah, especially at an early age, if he was actually three years older. Even into his teens, this would've been a pretty noteworthy disparity, and there just simply isn't reason to believe that the Lincolns would've gotten away with this. The other discrepancy in the five year age difference is that the earliest writings we have from Abe Lincoln himself are from 1824, which, according to the Enloe legend, would put Lincoln at age 20 instead of 15—the latter being more consistent with the fact that these writings were part of school assignments. We know that Lincoln did having some schooling, but nothing indicates that he was at age 20. This by itself isn't definitive proof against the theory, but there's more reason in it to accept the 1809 birthdate than the 1804 one.\n\nOverall, the documentation for all of this is spotty, as anyone would expect. But there's no reason to take the North Carolina story over the commonly accepted one because of spotty documentation. That's significantly better over *no* documentation, and the rumors about Lincoln's paternity very easily could've taken form when the documents placing T. Lincoln in Hardin County, Kentucky in these crucial years were yet undiscovered. That seems to make much more sense in explaining why this theory has cropped up and gained traction among some folks.\n\nAs for the supposed evidence about the appearance and intellect of the two... Well, that isn't good evidence at all as whether they look alike is to some degree subjective, but also not indicative of anything by itself. The noted traits are themselves caused by multiple genes, and to be tall one does not have to have tall parents (or even one tall parent). Same goes for intellect.\n\nI'm not sure about Lincoln's descendants refusing a DNA test—whether they have control over that, and whether they have actually refused to allow that if they do have ultimate say. Anyway, it's not 'very telling'. It's circumstantial evidence at best, like the claims that Mrs. Harding poisoned her husband because she refused to allow an autopsy.\n\nEdit - [snapshot.](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshots/1018133)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hdru7/apparently_unrestricted_warfare_is_only_a_modern/",
        "text": "[This](http://www.wired.com/2014/09/wwis-u-boats-launched-age-unrestricted-warfare/) article was posted to /r/history today with the hyperbolic title of \"How WWI’s U-Boats Launched the Age of Unrestricted Warfare\". \n\nThe first thing I have issue with is the actual title of the article. No, the U-boats *didn't* launch an age of unrestricted warfare (which the article doesn't really define but seems to interpret as deliberate attacks on civilian populations). \n\nThere are countless examples of this sort of warfare throughout history. The Indian Wars are a good example of this, where a common tactic of both sides was to burn the homes  and villages of the civilian populations. \n\nThe shelling and burning of port cities can certainly be considered deliberate attacks on civilians, and this has been a tactic employed in almost every war ever fought. \n\nWe could point to the Crusaders and the destruction of Jerusalem, or the Mongols and the way they spread fear through their use of violence. Or I could point to the [sack of Magdeburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Magdeburg) during the Thirty Years War.  \n\nThe other issue I have with the title is the idea that the 20th and 21st centuries have been all about unrestricted warfare. If anything the 20th century and 21st centuries have made unrestricted warfare a thing that's to be avoided as much as possible, or to cover up and hide (at least post-WWII). \n\nNow on to the specifics of the article in question.\n\n&gt;As the war geared up, the Germans and the British believed the big battles would be fought with huge ships like the HMS Dreadnought and its sisters. Submarines, they figured, would be limited to coastal defense, preventing blockades by enemy ships and serving as lookouts.\n\n&gt;Instead, the war saw the first widespread use of the technology. \n\nThis paragraph makes it seem like there weren't any large naval battles during the wars because submarines made them obsolete. That, of course, isn't true. [Battle of Jutland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland) anybody?\n\n&gt;The Brits, worried about losing hugely expensive battleships to U-boats, kept their big guns near home. They formed an effective blockade of German ports using smaller vessels, stopping vital supplies from reaching shore.\n\nThese two sentences are contradictory. If the British (and it wasn't just them with a large naval presence) kept their big ships close to home, then how did they blockade Germany? The answer is that they didn't keep their big ships close to home. There several large sea battles fought between surface ships. [The Battle of Heligoland Bight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Heligoland_Bight_\\(1914\\)) was the first naval battle of the war, fought on August 28, 1914 when British ships attacked a German patrol. \n\n[The Second Battle of Heligoland Bight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Heligoland_Bight) was fought in 1917 after the Germans raided a Scandinavian convoy. \n\nI guess the [Battle of Dogger Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dogger_Bank_\\(1915\\)) might count as keeping the big guns close to home since it was fought about 70 miles from England, but it was the result of English forces moving out to attack a German fleet, so not really a defensive battle like the article implies.\n\n[The Battle of Jutland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland) was fought in 1916 near Denmark.\n\nNow it's true that most of the surface battles were fought in the North Sea, and maybe the author equated the entire North Sea with being close to England, but the North Sea is a *really* big place.\n\n&gt;The sinking of the Lusitania helped garner public support for America to join the side of the Allies, which it did two years later.\n\nIt can't have been that much public support if it took two years for America to join the war effort. \n\nThere's some bonus badhistory [in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2hcler/how_wwis_uboats_launched_the_age_of_unrestricted/), including suggestions that blockading is equivalent to open warfare on civilians, as well as comments suggesting that Sherman's March to the Sea was unrestricted warfare (no it wasn't--it was quite restricted in fact). \n\n\n",

However, since I can't find any other post on it and I haven't submitted content here for quite some time, I'll talk about it now.  \n\n00:44-Not so much bad history as bad representation: the bullet shot by Charles Dickinson hit Jackson [near his heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson#Family_and_personal_life), not in his shoulder as the video seems to imply. In fact, the bullet was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed.  \n\n00:50-Dickinson too was [shot in the chest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickinson_%28historical_figure%29#Death), not in the head as the video implies.  \n\n00:58-Perhaps the most egregious history in the video; Andrew Jackson was not nicknamed \"Old Hickory\" because \"he used to carry around a hickory cane and beat people senseless with it.\" The nickname was given to him [during the Battle of New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson#Battle_of_New_Orleans) by soldiers who \"said he was 'tough as old hickory' wood on the battlefield,\" due to his strict sense of discipline. More on the \"beating people senseless part\" next.  \n\n02:03-If wikipedia is [to be believed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson#Attack_and_assassination_attempt), the tale of Jackson beating Lawrence with his cane is a product of legend and of questionable veracity.  \n\n02:17-Well, historians believe that the reason Lawrence's guns misfired was the [humid weather on that day.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawrence_%28failed_assassin%29#Assassination_attempt) The video omits that part. But we can all agree that the bullets being scared by Jackson is a way cooler explanation, if you're willing to piss on historicity, that is.",

        "title": "In a thread about how FDR was literally Hitler, /r/Libertarian then discusses the ways in which Lincoln was also literally Hitler. There's some interesting new arguments in here, amid the usual ones.",
        "author": "turtleeatingalderman",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2h3g9x/in_a_thread_about_how_fdr_was_literally_hitler/",
        "text": "[The thread.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/2gzu1h/fdr/cko28ua)\n\nOn the original post: placing sole blame on FDR for Japanese Internment is a bit unfair to FDR, even though reasoning behind U.S. internment policies was very, very shitty. As is calling him evil for enforcing policies that required farmers not grow crops or burn crops to maintain price levels as part of an overall and complicated strategy for recover.\n\nNow onto the bad Civil War history:\n\n&gt;Except instead of \"Japanese\" put dissenters.\n\nThese things are not really comparable, as dissenters weren't interned for their ancestry. The Japanese were interned regardless of their sympathies, not for any actual sympathies to Japanese imperialism or active attempts at sabotage.\n\n&gt;And if you dislike Lincoln then you must be pro slavery!\n\nNeo-Confederates argue this all the time, and I don't see why they think this straw man is common. That said, they do seem eager to defend the rights of slaveowners over the rights of the enslaved.\n\n&gt;Obviously slavery was a horrible thing. It probably would have lasted a few more years without the south losing the war.\n\nThe combined value of property held in slavery in the U.S. exceeded the combined worth of U.S. factories and banks according to Eric Foner, amounting to about $4 billion to the latter's ~ $3.5 billion. And the Southern slave interests were not giving that up without a war. Slavery wasn't going away in \"a few more years.\" Decades, maybe. Not years.\n\n&gt;But a good thing coming from an evil action does not make the action just. Plus, although it's not really applicable to this exact argument, I love showing people what a racist Lincoln was in the first place.\n\nThat first bit is actually okay, but then it devolves into another hackneyed point about Lincoln. Yes, Lincoln did express racist sentiments, but why would this not be expected of a southerner living in central Illinois in the mid nineteenth century? And anyway, the extent to which Lincoln actually believed in the superiority of white people is debatable. I elaborate on that [here:](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2fuug5/lets_see_what_this_ancap_ranting_to_his_webcam/ckdtvv8)\n\n&gt;&gt;I don't outright dismiss them, I hint at the possibility of them being disingenuous, as that's all the primary material can allow me to do if my claims are to stick within the confines of how bias can be analyzed and what can honestly be concluded from them. I note, but don't elaborate very well on, his statements that people often cite as evidence of his deeply-held racism. These of course contrast with the statements he made on equality throughout his career, but most notably on things like the introduction of suffrage for certain freedmen and the possibility of freedmen holding political office. This can mean a few things: (a) his earlier positions were in fact disingenuous but served the purpose of aligning himself with his audiences while still sticking to a commitment to his anti-slavery beliefs, (b) that he did truly believe in natural inequality of races, but changing circumstances allowed him to take a moral radical approach to legal equality than he had previously done, or (c) that Lincoln was able to change his beliefs on natural equality while still adapting a more radical stance on legal equality along a similar timeline. I don't know which answer is correct because none has a superior amount of support behind it, unless there's some primary or secondary material that makes a compelling case that I simply don't recall or haven't come across.\n\nTalking about \"what a racist Lincoln was\" is a pretty shitty analysis of his statements, for the above reasons and in contextualizing them.\n\n&gt;I'm 100% anti-slavery, since the rights of the individual trump all other rights. However, I also believe that it should be within a state's rights to leave the Union.\n\nOk, I'll grant that this one's more a political argument, but it's also a bad analysis of history in that it's projecting their viewpoint onto a debate that took decades of argument and a massive war to resolve. And I'm not sure where that right comes from, as it's not in the Constitution, and is in fact contradicted by it several times by statements describing federal authority over states. That therefore made Lincoln's policy to preserve the Union one of a will to uphold his obligations as president, not one of *der Wille zur Macht.* It's also a bit of a contradictory statement, as the right of a state to leave the Union in this case meant the preservation of institutionalized violation of individual rights.\n\nI'll skip the stupid Bruce Willis meme.\n\n&gt;&gt;The Civil War was overwhelmingly about slavery with all other issues taking at most a very marginal role.\n\n&gt;Lincoln didn't think so. He made multiple offers, during the war to let the south keep slavery in perpetuity if they'd lay down their weapons and pay the tariffs.\n\nThat reply doesn't make any sense. Because Lincoln initially expressed no intent to interfere with slavery where it already existed, the war itself somehow isn't about slavery? Anyway, not long into the war emancipation becomes one of the primary Union objectives. More info: [1,](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2da2ar/one_user_in_roldschoolcool_associates_the/cjo57k1) [2,](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/secession/) [3,](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html) [4.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2fuug5/lets_see_what_this_ancap_ranting_to_his_webcam/ckd608n?context=1)\n\n&gt;Also, when Lincoln wrote that editorial he had already penned the Gettysburg Address - an executive order freeing all slaves in rebelling states - although that wasn't actually revealed or executed for another year and change.\n\nThis person seems to be confusing the EP with the Gettysburg Address, possibly because they're both tied to important battles (the former to Antietam, as Lincoln was waiting for something close enough to a victory to issue the preliminary EP, which he did in the wake of that strategic victory, which is followed by other Confederate losses at Corinth and Iuka, as well as Perryville).\n\n&gt;After it was clear the north was going to win he declared slavery illegal in the confederate states.\n\nLincoln issued the preliminary EP in September 1862. Union victory at this point was by no means guaranteed. As I note above, the strategic victory at Antietam was what led him to issue it, but that was merely a repulsion of invading Confederate forces. Lee's army was left intact, albeit having been forced to retreat.\n\n&gt;Guess again. If he didn't want a war, he would have withdrawn federal troops from the territory of states that had seceded.\n\nUnion property was swallowed up initially under Buchanan, with a few holdouts like Fort Sumter. Which, by the way, was territory ceded to the U.S. government by the state of South Carolina. It wasn't the territory of a Confederate state, legally or in any other sense. Refusal to pull Major Anderson's and his troops from Fort Sumter was well within the scope of Lincoln's authority, although he would still have command over Union troops on actual South-Carolinian territory legally speaking.\n\n&gt;There were slaves in every state when they overthrew British rule. England abolished slavery before any American state did. Does that make the American revolution a war to preserve slavery?\n\nThat's flat out incorrect aside from being a stupid way to make an argument. [Plenty of U.S. states abolished slavery before England did in 1833.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States#Abolition_in_the_North)\n\n&gt;Fort Sumter was a tax collection station.\n\nNo it wasn't. It wasn't even completed in 1861. I've seen it claimed that it was a tax collection site, but I've never seen it sourced anywhere. Even if that was its intended purpose (it fucking wasn't), it wasn't operational when Anderson occupied it.\n\n&gt;I disagree. The largest slave state, Virgina, 5-10 years before the Civil War almost outlawed slavery. It lost by only one vote.\n\nThat proves nothing about the rest of the South, or about Virginia. Virginia was still hugely in favor of slavery, and enacted policies that censored abolitionist propagandists within its borders, and one county even indicted a New York abolitionist society for inciting uprisings among slaves in Virginia. Abolitionists in Virginia were in some cases, upon discovery of their sympathies, assumed to be spreading propaganda to undermine slavery, and were punished (e.g. John Gorinth in 1851).\n\n&gt;Slavery was already on the way out when the Civil War happened. The war killed millions of Americans for nothing but politics and I blame Lincoln for most of that (and not just because several members of my family was killed from his actions).\n\nReally? ***Millions?*** The highest estimate I've ever seen is 750 thousand.\n\n&gt;The fact that slavery went away on its own in Europe years before isn't justification that slavery was on its way out?\n\nThat isn't comparable. No European country had a plantation system based around labor-intensive agriculture or anywhere close to four million slaves. The only other place with comparable figures is Brazil, though the U.S. still exceeded Brazil according to most estimates I've seen.\n\n&gt;Lincoln was far more concerned with maintaining the union (read: his ego) than he was with abolishing slavery. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died because Lincoln didn't want to go down in history as the president that lost the southern states.\n\nThere's no evidence that Lincoln was motivated by his image in the history books, but plenty of evidence to suggest that he viewed secession as an illegal action and failing to oppose it a violation of his sworn duties as the POTUS. Anyway, this understates the emergent nationalism that had developed on both sides of the conflict from the decades of increasing sectionalism. We can't ignore the agency that volunteers and other supporters of the war effort exercised simply because we have a political axe to grind because of Lincoln's actions.\n\n&gt;This is very very incorrect. Slavery was a large issue, and it was the hot-button issue of the day. Therefore most other issues were phrased with the language of slavery (the anti-slave party, non-slave states, slave states, etc.). That doesn't mean the war was \"overwhelmingly about slavery\". Slavery was the terrorism of the day. Every time the government tries to stamp on a new Right, they phrase it in terms of National Security and Terrorist Threat. That doesn't mean those issues are actually because of terrorism.\n\nI'm having trouble with this one. It's just all-around nonsense.\n\n&gt; Even if it were, that's a stupid cause to to start killing you own citizens over especially considering it was already on the wait out\n\nVolcanodammit, fuck this shit! These folks seem to be so incurious that they're literally incapable of coming up with a new argument. And it doesn't matter what *you* think was a stupid cause. That has no bearing on what the Southern politicians actually decided, which was to send people to die for the preservation of slavery.\n\n&gt;Interestingly enough, the south actually did have a fairly well laid out plan to get rid of slavery, starting by banning slave trading and importation of slaves. Not perfect, but a good enough start.\n\nThat was done as a U.S. policy in 1807, going into enforcement 1808. It's in no way tied to an overall plan for gradual abolition in the South. That was absolutely out of the question to most Southerners. And they still traded slaves, and took advantage of black market slave importation through the 1850s, possibly the 1860s.\n\nThey did, however, take actions to *preserve* slavery—namely, by making it illegal to abolish.\n\n&gt;God I almost wish he wasnt killed. Thats the only reason he is immortalized. If he wasnt he killed he woyldve been impeached and shown his true colors.\n\nWhat?\n\n&gt;Careful what you wish for. Imagine if Lincoln had managed to pick up a few extra terms in office... &lt;shudders&gt;\n\nOh fucking hell.\n\n&gt;As a history major, southerner, and confederate sympathizer (for the most part, I think most southern states seceded legally and properly)\n\nNope. I'm done.",

        "text": "In 2001 the USA Network premiered a three hour mini-series titled Attila, which was naturally about the life of Attila the Hun. The project was the brainchild of the producers behind the Mummy franchise and they set out with a bold vision of attempting to create a project with the same scope and grandeur as an old Hollywood epic and bring it to television. To helm their mini-series, they brought on Dick Lowry,   a man responsible for a series of westerns starring singer Kenny Rogers and TV movies about ALF and Archie. The script was written by Robert Cochran, one of the co-writers of 24. To round out this odd menagerie of talent is the man who they chose to play Attila. Attila the Hun was described by the Greek historian Priscus as, “Short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with grey; and he had a flat nose and tanned skin, showing evidence of his origin”. The casting director believed that the role of a short, weather beaten, fearsome and (possibly?) Asian looking man would be perfect for a handsome six foot tall Scotsman. Yes, somebody thought that Gerard Butler would make a convincing steppe warlord. This was not the superstar Gerard Butler that would helm 300 or romantic lead Gerard Butler who would go on to star in a series of terrible movies. At the turn of the 21st century Gerard Butler was a washed up lawyer trying to transition into acting and the role of Attila the Hun was one of his big breaks. It is not as terrible as John Wayne playing Genghis Khan and Butler has a certain charisma and intensity that would explain his later rise to stardom. Please take a look at the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkhstwMG2QQ) to get a taste of what we’re dealing with here.\n\nThe casting might have left a bad taste in your mouth, but ultimately there are some good things to say about the mini-series. Somebody actually bothered to open up a history book and take a look. Some events are taken straight from the Greek and Roman historians who wrote about the Huns and the series is littered with some neat historical touches.  What fails the mini-series are the resources afforded to the filmmakers. For example, the Battle of Chalons, one of the bloodiest battles of the age, is recreated with 500 extras drawn from the Lithuanian army and mounted police. It ends up looking like an overglorified LARP rather than a vicious bloodbath as described by historians such as Jordanes. Other battle scenes are similarly anemic. Additionally, some of the bad history displayed in this series is done for narrative convenience or dramatic effect and understandable but some cases are downright bizarre (did you know that Attila had a magical witch sidekick?)  I’ll address the major historical shortcomings of the piece, and also some of the good history in the sections below: \n\n**Attila Begins** \n\nWe have no surviving record describing Attila’s childhood. All we know is that he had a brother named Bleda and their father was a man named Mundzuk (or Mundiuch). We also know that Mundzuk had three brothers; two of those three brothers, Rua (or Ruga) and Octar, were co-rulers of Huns. After the death of Octar, Rua became sole king and Attila and Bleda subsequently succeeded Bleda upon his death in 434. The first surviving historical record mentioning Attila has him at the banks of the Danube signing the Treaty of Margus. The treaty required the Eastern Roman Empire to pay the Huns a sum of 700 pounds of gold per year and return all Hunnic prisoners of war and fugitives. Thus the first picture we have of Attila is that of him in a leadership position and as an adult. What happened in his childhood?  Did Attila and Bleda have to contend with the sons of their uncles to ascend the Hunnic throne?  How was power split between Attila and Bleda in their co-rulership? The argument has been forwarded that Bleda was the leader of the Huns while Attila was a powerful second-in-command.  These questions remain unanswered as there are no Hunnish records and the surviving Germanic, Greek and Roman accounts are silent or vague on these matters. In short, there is a large hole in Attila’s biography and so the mini-series invents an origin story for Attila the Hun. \n\nThe mini-series begins with a young Attila hunting with his father and his retainers. At the conclusion of the hunt, one of the retainers mentions that they have strayed into the lands of Donatus. This is the first indication that somebody took a look at the history books. Donatus was the name of a figure in Hunnic history and most books on the Huns will mention that Donatus was a Hunnic king who was murdered by an Eastern Roman delegation (which included the historian Olympiodorus) around 412. Only a fragment of Olympiodorus’ account of that delegation survives and he never explicitly mentions that Donatus was a king or even a Hun. Given that Donatus was a common Latin name, an alternate and rather plausible theory is that Donatus was a Roman émigré and the delegation was whacking a politically inconvenient figure; if nothing else, it would explain how the Eastern Romans avoided any repercussions through simple bribery. It is rather nice that instead of making up a name, they took a name of a figure that they most likely thought was a Hunnic leader. \nAlso of interest is that during this opening, they have Attila’s grandmother tell him the story of how the Huns entered modern day Ukraine (a gadfly stung a horse and a herdsman followed the horse across the Straits of Kerch).  This account of the Hunnic migrations is taken straight from the speculations of the historian Eunapius. The thing about this myth is that it heavily plagiarizes the story of Io from Greek mythology and highlights a major flaw in the methodology of the Greek and Roman historians of the day. The historians were writing for an educated audience and to show their own erudition as well as conform with the expectations of their readers, they would often insert passages, names and sayings from writers of old such as Herodotus  or draw parallels between the events they were writing about and events of yore. This tendency has made discerning the truth somewhat difficult. \n\nThe scenes of domestic bliss are interrupted by Donatus’ marauding band. They massacre Attila’s parental figures and tribe but Attila escapes onto the open steppe with nothing but a horse. Attila cuts his horse’s neck and drinks its blood as a means of nourishment. This is taken from descriptions of how nomadic soldiers would sustain themselves on their horse’s blood during long campaigns and it’s a neat touch.  Attila is found by his uncle Rua and taken in. The scenes between Attila and Rua at camp are way to allow the filmmakers to say, “Look at all the research we did!” Rua quizzes Attila on how to make a compound bow and the sacred animals of the Huns (the horse, the she-bear and the wolverine). If nothing else you can say that they tried at making something factual. \n\n**Attila’s Magical Witch Sidekick** \n\nThe Attila of this movie is portrayed as fatalistic and superstitious to a fault. Most of his actions in the movie are committed due to the advice of his magical witch sidekick named Galen and he falters during his invasion of Gaul because he receives no signs from above. There were shamans and soothsayers in Hunnic society and certainly there were superstitions and prophecy but there are no indications that Attila was beholden to these things as in the mini-series. Attila, if anything, was rather shrewd in using religious iconography and imagery for political gains. He appropriated the title of ‘scourge of God’ to awe and frighten his Christian enemies and he kept his nomads in line by claiming he wielded the sword of the war god.\n\nThere is also an ahisotrical subplot of how Attila and Bleda are smitten with a captured peasant girl named N’kara. Bleda claims N’kara as a prize even though Attila and N’kara are in love. Galen intervenes by giving N’kara one hundred percent reliable birth control herbs to prevent her from producing any children by Bleda. Galen is later blackmailed by Bleda into creating an untraceable poison to kill Rua. Attila challenges Bleda to a duel for the rulership of the Huns and they have a rather well choreographed horse archery duel. Bleda coats his arrows with the aforementioned untraceable poison and Galen intervenes again (she is basically a one woman deus ex machina) by using a magic ritual to draw out the poison into her and give her strength to Attila; she then dies.  Even after death, she continues her deus ex machina ways by being buried right near the sword of the war god Attila was looking for.  In short, she is the source of the most bizarre and ahistorical aspects of this mini-series.  In addition, her convenient prophecies rob Attila of any agency and so he is less a skilled leader of his people but rather a guy lucky enough to find a very good seer.  As for the various subplots addressed above – Attila and Bleda did have a severe disagreement regarding a person, but it wasn’t a girl. Bleda had a Moorish dwarf named Zerco (or Zerkon) that he kept for entertainment (he liked him so much that he commissioned a set of armor for the dwarf so he could accompany Bleda on campaign) and Attila hated his guts; Attila would later give this dwarf to Flavius Aetius (sadly there is no dwarf in this series). Additionally, upon Rua’s death, Bleda and Attila both ascended to leadership roles and this arrangement lasted till 445 when Attila apparently murdered Bleda (once again no specifics on the matter survive). There was no duel and there was no magic ritual. Additionally, there are multiple proposed dates and causes of Rua’s death, though none of those proposed theories involve Bleda killing him with a super poison. \n\nAfter Galen dies, Attila gets a new sidekick named Orestes. Orestes is an actual historical figure and quite interesting. He was a Roman aristocrat of Germanic origins who joined Attila’s court and served as a diplomat and later secretary. After Attila’s death, Orestes rejoined the Western Roman Empire; he deposed the sitting emperor and declared his own son Romulus Augustus as emperor. \n\n**Flavius Aetius** \n\nThe mini-series also focuses on the career of Flavius Aetius, one of the last great Roman generals. The interaction between Aetius and the Roman emperor Valentinian III allow the filmmakers to once again demonstrate their research. In an early strategy session, Aetius mentions how the Huns drove the Goths across the Danube in 376 and essentially split the Roman Empire in two. He further mentions how he was given over to the Huns as a hostage as well. These two points are accurate. Furthermore, the mini-series depicts how Aetius used the Huns as a counterweight against the various Germanic tribes. The first battle scene in the series involves Aetius allying with Attila and his Huns to confront the Goths under Theodoric. The miniseries is once again accurate in this regard; Aetius’ rise to power was dependent on his access to Hunnic troops. Early in his career, Aetius backed a usurper to the Western throne named Joannes. Joannes had sent Aetius off to secure a Hunnic army and Aetius had succeeded in that mission; unfortunately Aetius returned too late and Joannes had already been put to death. Aetius nonetheless had a terrifying Hunnic army at his back and this gave him substantial political clout. He negotiated a deal with the emperor’s mother Galla Placidia that would elevate him to commander in chief of the Roman armies (magister militum) in exchange for sending the Huns home. Aetius would later use the Huns to annihilate the Burgundians and keep the Goths in check. \n\nWhile they get many details of Aetius’ career right, there are still several mistakes. Aetius is first introduced as a prisoner of Galla Placidia and Valentinian III for attempting to overthrow the latter. As mentioned previously, the historic Aetius avoided this fate via clever diplomacy and his Hunnic army. Furthermore, the script introduces a bizarre subplot involving Aetius being married to the ex-wife of Theodoric of the Goths and raising Theodoric’s daughter Lydia. Aetius did not have a familial connection to Theodoric (or have a daughter named Lydia), though he did marry the widow of his rival Bonifacius (who is omitted from this film). The mini-series is also depicts Aetius as a clever schemer; most of his schemes historically were directed against the aforementioned Count Bonifacius, though in the case of the mini-series, his antagonist is Galla Placidia. Some of the best scenes in the mini-series are the interactions between Aetius and Attila where Aetius tutors the more direct and honest Attila on the finer points of diplomacy, trickery and manipulation. \n\nOn a side note, Flavius Aetius is played by the improbably named Powers Boothe (he of *Sin City* and Philip Marlowe fame) and he doesn’t get one hardboiled noir monologue in this entire work. The production is poorer for it. \n\n**The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains**\n\nThere are several theories proposed by historians in the 5th century as to why Attila the Hun invaded Gaul. The first theory was that Attila had received a ring and the promise of her hand in marriage from Honoria the sister of Valentinian III. Honoria had been caught plotting against her brother and shipped off to the Eastern Roman Empire and she smuggled out the ring to convince Attila to rescue her. To sweeten the deal, she also offered half the Western Roman Empire as dowry. The mini-series faithfully recounts this theory. As for the other theories: Priscus speculates that Attila’s target in the invasion of Gaul was actually the Gothic kingdom centered around Toulouse and this invasion was committed at the behest of the Vandal king Gaiseric (possibly due to some interfamilial drama between Gaiseric and Theodoric involving facial mutilation); This line of thinking is supported by the Gothic historian Jordanes who stated that Attila was bribed by Gaiseric into attacking the Goths. The third theory was that Attila’s invasion was to settle a succession dispute among the Franks settled in Gaul and subordinate them under his rule. Given that Attila’s first targets on the Gallic campaign were Frankish cities such as Cologne, this theory is not entirely ridiculous. The Gothic theory is somewhat discredited by the fact that Attila’s forces remained in northern Gaul and marched west instead of south towards Toulouse. A secondary objective of Attila’s in this Gallic campaign may have been to decisively destroy the Roman army and thereby leave the western empire ripe for exploitation. \n\nAttila’s forces were confronted by a joint Gothic-Roman force at the Catalaunian Plains (near Chalons or maybe Troyes, the location of the battlefield is disputed). Attila had been besieging Orleans when the joint Gothic-Roman force marched north. This alliance was rather shocking because of the historical animosity between Aetius and Theodoric. Attila promptly retreated from Orleans to the aforementioned plains and set up defensive positions in the form of a wagon laager. The Goths and Romans arrived afterward, though the battle between the two armies did not commence until the late evening. The ensuing night fighting was bloody and confusing; the Gothic king Theodoric was killed; one theory holds that he was run over by his own cavalry while another claims that a Goth fighting on Attila’s side struck the mortal blow. Aetius himself was separated from his troops and had to spend the night among the Goths.  After the slaughter, all parties withdrew to their respective homelands. That is the account of the Catalaunian Plains as given to us by the Gothic historian Jordanes (naturally it has a pro-Gothic bias). The mini-series gets everything wrong about the Catalaunian Plains. \n\nAttila’s forces actually take Orleans in the mini-series (with the help of future technology in the form of counterweight trebuchets). This prompts Aetius to seek out Theodoric and join forces. The mini-series has Attila launch the attack on the Goths and the Romans rather than the opposite and the fighting occurs in broad daylight instead of the night. Theodoric is killed by a Roman soldier on the orders of Aetius (due to the silly married to the same woman subplot) rather than by enemy action or due to friendly trampling. After the victory, Thorismund, Theodoric’s son, withdraws his Goths to secure his throne from his brothers as Aetius futilely pleads for them to stay and finish the Huns. This is the opposite of Jordanes’ accounts. The Goths were incensed at the death of Theodoric and were ready to finish off Attila; it was Aetius who convinced Thorismund to head home. The reasons for Aetius’ actions are disputed; one theory is that Aetius wanted to maintain the balance of power and therefore let Attila survive so he could counterbalance the Gothic threat. More cynical theories advanced by historians such as Gregory of Tours stated that Aetius had secured payments from Attila to convince the Goths to leave or that he convinced the Goths to leave so he could keep the spoils of war. Whatever the case, the events in the mini-series were opposite to what was recorded in history (and that history itself is questionable due to the biases of the Gallo-Roman, Gothic, Greek historians writing them). \n\nThe mini-series concludes with the death of Attila after the battle of the Catalaunian Plains and it completely omits his Italian campaign. \n\n**Summary**\n\nThe filmmakers did their historical research and incorporated a lot of it into this mini-series. There are still some bizarre cases of bad history though. \n\nSources: \nMaenchen-Helfen, Otto. *The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture*.

        "text": "History is defined by human action and reaction. Whether due to our current technological obsessions or due to a different method of study, many people substitute normal historiographical analysis with what a friend of mine has called Rivet Counting. Rivet counting involves knowing the specifications of a weapon or vehicle without acknowledging the history behind the use (tactics, operational tactics, etc). You see this mainly in discussion about weapons, such as how glorious the Stg 44 is or how deadly the King Tiger tank is compared to the Sherman. With this train of thought, “superior German technology” should have won over the “clearly inferior Allied weaponry” but that’s not the history. Germany lost World War Two, numbers don’t mean as much as people think.\n\nAbout a month ago, I asked a question concerning how WW2 is seen in public history and how it is told, looking at how people mythologize the weaponry as superior. /u/BritainOpPlsNerf wrote about how Germans were skilled but limited in their tactics, but wrote an odd phrase that suggested that the K98, in usage, was the superior weapon. One of the readers saw this and argued against it writing this:\n\n&gt;If I may, your point on their personal arms at least partially untrue. Both the Rifle No.4 family and the M1 Garand are superior to the Kar.98k. Say what you will about the Mauser action, in combat, the semi automatic nature of the Garand and the 10 round capacity of the Lee Enfield are significant improvements over the Mauser. The French MAS.36 is at least equal, if not slightly superior to the Kar 98, especially ergonomically. In terms of pistols, the M1911A1 carries roughly the same number of rounds as the P38, but in .45ACP, rather than 9x19 (.355in). Say what you will, but .45 is bigger than .35, and bigger bullets tend to transfer more energy to the target.\n\nThe original responder (BritainOP), responds by noting that he was talking about the use of the K98 on the tactical level rather than the operational level. The quoted commentor discussed logistics (which are important to the defeat of Germany) but put much of his argument about how the K98 was an archaic weapon. However, the use is what made it effective (centering the squad around the MG-34/42). \nTo add to this, /u/Mosin91 discusses American involvement in the Pacific against Japanese riflemen using Muaser type rifles:\n\n&gt;The US Marine Corp bitterly fought it's way across the Pacific, their M1's vs the Japanese 5 shot Mauser derivatives, which shows that mere superiority of infantry arms in and of itself does not count for a lot. In fact, it wasn't until the US could maintain air, sea and supply superiority that they could finally start sweeping across the Pacific and threaten Japan. The same goes for Europe. You can shove all the rounds you can in your infantry rifle, but until you can ensure those men have all the support they need to advance, it doesn't matter.\n\nAgain, this points to the limited importance of superior weaponry but rather points to the involvement of various parts of a military to gain superiority.\n\nFrom this, it must be said, knowing these numbers doesn’t mean anything. The weapons are just tools for armies to use, the tactics (which includes how the weapons are used) tell more of a story than how many rounds X gun can fire or how powerful Y gun is. When you only look at the numbers, you lose the humanity of the history. More importantly, as I have stated, the weapons are tools. These tools are used in war, but the tools don’t win the war, the weapons are used as tools by humans, humans that once lived and breathed. These humans created the tactics that we have come to know “Fix and flank,” “mission orientated tactics” and etc. Study the actions of humans, not the number of rounds in a gun.\n\nEdit: To emphasize, this is mainly to point out a problem within military history. It's common in /r/AskHistorians posts and it is a problem when these types of comments come up. All that I wish to point out is the trend and how it contributes very little to standard analysis of history.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2h02m0/michael_woods_the_story_of_india_spice_routes_and/",
        "text": "I will start by saying that I love Michael Wood. In fact, if you don't like Michael Wood I can only assume there is something horribly wrong with you. If you could some condense pure, sincere enthusiasm and love of history and culture without a trace of irony or condescension into a human form, you would get Michael Wood. By all accounts he is also an indefatigable and fearless worker, a talented presented and entertainer, and has a surprisingly sharp, but never mean spirited, wit. I've been enjoying his documentaries since I was very young, so I will start by saying that, yes, you should watch this series.\n\nThat being said, occasionally his overpowering enthusiasm erodes his critical senses and, yes, some bad history enters in. As this episode happens to be focused on my particular area of study, the spice trade between India and Rome, I figured that writing this review would be a good way of keeping me sharp. I watched ten minutes of the show before deciding to do this, so I will note a few things then proceed from ten minutes using time stamps.\n\n&gt;Ships\n\nWood pushes a \"necessity is the mother of invention\" line, which is completely false. His essentially argument is that the development of shell first ship construction allowed the trade to flourish, but in reality, shell first construction was the norm in the Mediterranean since time immemorial. he is completely correct about the strength and sturdiness of it as a construction technique, a fact often lost by this who want to shove the development of maritime technology into a simplistic narrative of linear progression. That being said, there is no evidence that the Indians learned the technique from the Romans.\n\nIt is also worth noting that he has the time table wrong, which I can;t blame him for as scholarship on the subject did too until surprisingly recently. The *Periplus* mentions a start date from July, which was often taken to mean leaving the Red Sea in July, but in reality it almost certainly means leaving *Egypt* then--the trip down the Red Sea would the  take the time to August, where one catches the dying monsoon winds. This is important because traditionally ports along the Indian Ocean are very seasonal, and a Roman ship arriving in August would find no anchorage.\n\n\n&gt;Ports\n\nSpeaking of, he exaggerates the number of ports. The *Periplus* mentions three ports of Egypt: Arsinoe, Myos Hormos, and Berenike, so the coastline wasn't exactly dotted. But I can;t stay mad at him about that!\n\nIt is also worth noting that his information as to the location of Muziris is outdated. The location of Muziris was probably near modern Pattanam, not Kodungallar. Again, can;t really blame him for that.\n\n&gt;Suresh\n\nSUUURRRREEEESSSSHHHH! A controversial Indian historian, he takes his requisite screen time here. And is wrong! His claim is that the Indians \"did not need\" the product from outside, and so people came to India. This is true to a point, but ignores the fact that Indian merchants were highly active in the Red Sea, traveling to Arabia and Egypt. So not so unimportant.\n\n&gt;[13:34] South India was not just a string of trading ports, it was a great classical civilization, whose center of power lay over the mountains in the East.\n\nIt is true that south India has a rich culture at this time all to often forgotten in favor of study of the Roman connection, but to call it a civilization with a single center of power is misleading. During this period, South India was loosely organized, roughly divided between the Chera, Chola and Pandya \"clans\". Somewhat anachronistically, his focus is on modern Tamil Nadu, but in the context of the trade the western Chera were actually more significant.\n\n&gt;[17:05] Written in Roman times.\n\nThe dating of the *sangam* poetry and epics is fiercely contested, but \"Roman times\" is probably a bit too early--the were probably composed just after, but describing, the main period of Roman contact.\n\n&gt;[1938] Gold\n\nActually, the main Roman coinage issue in India were silver, not gold. Still, gold is cool.\n\n&gt;The first glimmerings of a global economy\n\nHere we have Wood doing his best to woo me. But I will stay strong!\n\n&gt;[22:16] the Silk Road\n\nThis is where things get more complicated. Oddly enough, in practically every period of history the land based Silk Road is significantly less well studied than the sea based Spice Road. In fact, it is only very recently that historians have begun to wrest the Early modern silk road out of the margins of historical research and put it on more equal footing with its maritime twin. So I may have less to say here, simply because, in inverse proportion to the popular conception, we know much less about it.\n\n&gt;[28:47]\n\nI like to imagine that Michael Wood spends his entire life in this wide eyed wonder, constantly remarking on things as \"just fantastic, isn't it?\" and stopping every now and then to make a breathless pronunciation of winder and majesty. \"And so we see here...this! Is the very shoebox in which came my first pair of shoes. It is just fantastic! You looks at it, and you see--smell!--the history coming off of it!\"\n\n&gt;[32:00]\n\nHard core stratigraphy porn right here.\n\n&gt;[37:34] Like all great rulers in India's history, the Kushana accepted all religions\n\nMy first issue is the generally idea of \"tolerance\" as applied to non-Abrahamic faiths. I simply think the concept is unhelpful. Romans and Buddhist rulers are frequently praised for their \"tolerance\", but that concept has no meaning without a tradition that assumes a singular, universal truth that must be followed. I understand why we in the modern era praise the ancient \"tolerant\" rulers, but I can't help thinking it normalizes intolerance.\n\nAlso, Aurangzeb was not particularly tolerant but is easily one of the great rulers of Indian history.\n\n&gt;Kushana Buddha image shaped how we see the Buddha today\n\n*Sort of*. The actual influential Buddha image was that of the Gupta, particularly the wonderful Sarnath Buddha. The Kushan absorption of Greek-influenced Gandhara was very influential in the development of later Buddhist imagery, but primarily because of its influence on Gupta styles rather than in itself.\n\n&gt;[42:00] This is what Canterbury would have looked like...\n\nI think this is actually a very important and somewhat difficult to grasp concept, It is very difficult for any Westerner outside of Italy and a few places in Spain to truly grasp the impact and experience of pilgrimage. From personal experience, I can say that India is one place where pilgrimage experience is very much alive, so it makes a very useful point of comparison.\n\nAlso, requisite scene of Michael Wood being horrifically charming to a group of local women (staying strong).\n\n&gt;[45:52] The Kushan was a great period for the codification of Indian knowledge\n\nIt is funny, because this is still something of a controversial, albeit extremely well supported, proposition. Traditionally, the Gupta were seen as the Golden Age which codified the great Indian traditions, but more and more we see precedent for the Gupta in the Kushan period, in terms of art, literature and systems of knowledge.\n\n&gt;[47:50] Dalai Lama\n\nI know I may be showing a *slight* mancrush on Michael Wood, but one thing I love about his documentaries is that he knows when to shut up. When His Holiness the 14^th Dalai Lama is speaking about Buddhism is usually a good time to shut up, and so he does.\n\n&gt;Ending bit\n\nThere is actually a very good portrayal of the multiple perspectives and narratives of history here: while the show as a whole had been positive towards the semi-legendary Kanishka, he shows the different possible interpretations in the \"folk\" tradition.\n\nAll in all, a very good episode of a great series, just remember that often the enthusiasm of the history overrides proper critical analysis, and that it is somewhat shallow. Still very much worth a watch.",

        "text": "Most people probably recognize this \"quote\" from John Adams about the American Revolution, where he states that \"1/3rd of the people were for it, 1/3rd of the people neutral, and 1/3rd of the people opposed.\" It's long been used to debunk the idea of a national mass uprising in 1775 and 1776.\n\nProblem is that the quote isn't talking about the American Revolution. Recently the origins of the quote have been getting more attention, with sights like the Journal of the American Revolution publishing articles about it. [This](http://allthingsliberty.com/2013/02/john-adamss-rule-of-thirds/) article by Michael Schellhammer (retired Army officer and writer who has had work published in several leading papers and who's written a book about the Hudson River campaign of 1779) attempts to debunk the idea that the 1/3rd quote is about the American Revolution. Unfortunately he also gets it wrong (or at least partially wrong) when he talks about it being about the French Revolution. \n\nIn reality the quote is about the [Quasi-War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War) with France. In the late 18th century tensions between American and France were increasing. Part of the tensions were because America refused to continue paying her debt to France on the grounds that the debt was owed to the French crown, not the French republic. In 1794, after the French Revolution, America signed a treaty with England called the [Jay Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty). France didn't like that, nor did they like America's non-payment of debt. France had signed a treaty with America earlier, and they regarded America's trading with England to be a violation of that treaty.\n\nFrench privateers began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with Britain. Then the French government refused to see the new American ambassador to France, Charles Pinckney. Pinckney and two other men who were sent to France to negotiate a treaty were approached by agents of the French Foreign Minister and told that they needed to offer bribes before they would be allowed to speak to him. \n\nThis infuriated them and they refused. Eventually they left France without being seen by anybody in the French government. This became known as the [XYZ Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_Affair). \n\nThis brings us to our John Adams quote. In 1815 Adams [wrote a letter](http://books.google.com/books?id=jRXOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=Of+this+ignorance,+when+I+went+to+Congress+in+1774,+I+can+assure+you,+Sir,+I+had+a+most+painful+consciousness+in+my+own+bosom.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6MdJzl93K3&amp;sig=TPhQ1gZ-PC9DXTmtcP2OkTJglC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L9wbVJqlFoa2ogSosYGABw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Of%20this%20ignorance%2C%20when%20I%20went%20to%20Congress%20in%201774%2C%20I%20can%20assure%20you%2C%20Sir%2C%20I%20had%20a%20most%20painful%20consciousness%20in%20my%20own%20bosom.&amp;f=false) to Massachusetts Senator James Lloyd where he said this:\n\n&gt;Of this ignorance, when I went to Congress in 1774, I can assure you, Sir, I had a most painful consciousness in my own bosom. There I had the disappointment to find, that almost every gentleman in that assembly was, in this kind of information, nearly as ignorant as myself; and what was a more cruel mortification than all the rest, the greatest part even of the most intelligent, full of prejudices and jealousies, which I had never before even suspected. Between 1774 and 1797, an interval of twenty-three years, this ignorance was in some measure removed from some minds. But some had retired in disgust, some had gone into the army, some had been turned out for timidity, some had deserted to the enemy, and all the old, steadfast patriots, weary of the service, always irksome in Congress, had retired to their families and States, to be made governors, judges, marshals, collectors, &amp;c., &amp;c. So that in 1797, there was not an individual in the House of Representatives, in the Senate, or in either of the executive departments of government, who had been in the national controversy from the beginning. Mr. Jefferson himself, the Vice-President, the oldest in service of them all, was but a young and a new man in comparison with the earliest conductors of the cause of the country, the real founders and legitimate fathers of the American republic. The most of them had been but a very few years in public business, and a large proportion of these were of a party which had been opposed to the revolution, at least in the beginning of it. If I were called to calculate the divisions among the people of America, as Mr. Burke did those of the people of England, **I should say that full one third were averse to the revolution**. These, retaining that overweening fondness, in which they had been educated, for the English, could not cordially like the French; indeed, they most heartily detested them. **An opposite third conceived a hatred of the English, and gave themselves up to an enthusiastic gratitude to France. The middle third, composed principally of the yeomanry, the soundest part of the nation, and always averse to war, were rather lukewarm both to England and France; and sometimes stragglers from them, and sometimes the whole body, united with the first or the last third, according to circumstances.**\n\n&gt;The depredations of France upon our commerce, and her insolence to our ambassadors, and even to the government, united, though for a short time, the second third with the first  . . .\n\nThe references to 1797, the focus on support for England vs France, the reference to the humiliation of the ambassadors, the reference to French attacks on American commerce--none of that makes sense when talking about the French Revolution, and the bit about \"the second third uniting with the first as a result of French insolence\" doesn't make sense in the context of the American Revolution.\n\nHowever, Adams *was* fond of the rule of thirds, so had he been asked directly about the American Revolution, he may well have described it in those terms. At one point during the Revolutionary War he described the officers in the Continental Army as 1/3rd corrupt, 1/3rd lazy, and 1/3rd good. He used the same breakdown in describing his fellow members of Congress to Thomas Jefferson \"To draw the characters of them all would require a volume, and would now be considered as a caricature-print; one third tories, another whigs, and the rest mongrels.\"",

        "text": "This has been bugging me for a while, like an itch I couldn't scratch.\n\nYou see, a few months ago I was wrapped up in a nasty bit of business over the Conflict Thesis and Galileo with a ratheist a while back, but I procrastinated a little too long, and another r/BadHistory member snatched it up before I could.\nWorse, he kind of botched it. That only served to give validation to this guy in question, and we certainly couldn't have *THAT*. Not two boilermakers in me. No sir.\n\n So I figured I might as well take advantage of the lapse in New Atheism dropping from the moratorium in order to fix a past BadHistory post from someone else that has been posted before, which somewhat incorrectly framed a discussion (discussion being used in the loosest sense of the word) I had with this /u/NukeThePope over the history of Astronomy and spanning time, space, nineteen centuries and two subreddits.\n[Here](http://np.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/22gbs8/perspectives_on_science_and_faith/cgpbeww) is his reply to a /u/TheGrammarBolshevik over the validity of [The Conflict Thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_thesis) something which has been thoroughly debunked by actual historians, but hey, it makes religion look bad, so let's work with it!! I assume this guy's brain sort of latches onto that kind of idea automatically and decides to work out the troublesome stuff, like *reasons*, for later, but listen to me ramble on about confirmation bias. Onto the BadHistory.\n\n&gt;Prior to Kepler/Galileo, the Catholic Church held and defended a geocentric view of the universe as based on the Bible. Science discovered that this view was incorrect, and we had some decades or centuries of exactly the kind of conflict -contradiction- you were asking about earlier.\n\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, Confucius say, but he ain't never say anything about having to do every step of the way with this /u/NukeThePope guy. Well, here is where I decide to jump in, thanks to my passing knowledge of the general Renaissance Era, which honestly is more than enough to refute 99% of the hate-filled propaganda that spews from r/Atheism, the ratheists who spill over into r/TrueAtheism, and the like. \n\nThis is a prime example of why you need to understand history to comment on it. It is true that the common narrative is that Galileo was punished for his radical ideas, but the poor, unheard and unappreciated minority of \"historians\" and \"people who can Google\" know the actual story. \n\nGalileo's heliocentric theory was rejected because it was unfounded, weakly supported and the geocentric theory made more sense based off of what the natural philosphers at the time could observe. They had rejected Galileo's heliocentric theory because it was a weak and faulty theory-- not because they were all science-hating religiozombies. ~~The Church NEVER held the geocentric theory up above others because of anything to do with Scripture, they and the rest of the goddamned world worked with the geocentric theory because it worked better than the heliocentric model. Sure, those presenting new theories had to explain how God was able make the sun stand still in the bible. I'm sure it was *real* difficult for people to say, \"it was a description of observation, not reality\" or-- \"Why are we qualifying what an omnipotent being can or can't do. If the Boss says the sun stands still then bitch the sun stands still\" and move on.~~\n\nNow, heliocentrism might seem obvious to us now, but surprise-surprise, people in the 16th century didn't really have access 5th grade science textbooks from the 21st century. Just imagine an 16th century astronomer on the ground, looking up at the sky and trying to make sense of it all. The idea that the earth is actually spinning on an axis and revolving around the sun rather than everything revolving around us was hugely not intuitive. It's about as comparable to tryng to figure out how a game of pool is going only through the viewcam of a pinhole camera attached to the surface of the 7 ball. Furthermore, heliocentrism didn't really make sense even when critically looked at, and had a lot of problems with the theory. For example, there was a lack of observable [stellar parallax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax), which put in layman's terms, is the shifting positions of stars relative to each other that we SHOULD see if the earth really was revolving around the sun. Of course, we know that there is stellar parallax now, but given the lack of sophisticated technology back then (thanks Obama) stellar parallax was nearly undetectable, and remained a huge thorn in the side of the arguments for Heliocentrism; instead many people believed the stars rotated in some kind of massive shell around the earth. Hell, we only managed to observe the first stellar parallax in the late *19th century.*\n\nHowever, crack open your whisky, and toss your wimpy shot glass in the sink; we're going straight to the bottle. You see, apparently God hates my liver, because if He did not He would not have sent this man to me. Ughhhhh... Eli, eli lema sabachthani.\n\n&gt;What kind of pseudo-knowledge are you regurgitating here? Stellar parallax had nothing to do with early research on geocentrism.\n\n&gt;Catholicism hung on the lips of Plato/Aristotle, who rambled some nonsense about natural laws and perfect forms. Later Greeks superseded these highly impractical ideas but Catholicism (and much of Christendom) cling to them until today.\n\n&gt;The astronomy **Aristoteles and Ptolmey** was based on heavenly bodies attached to perfect (there's that word again) spinning spheres. The problem with this model, of course, is that it fails to accurately account for the apparent motion of the planets - the movement of the Earth relative to their common origin introduces some embarrassing perturbations. Ptolmey's \"solution\" was to introduce even more \"perfect\" spherical entities to add some extra wiggle. Here was a typical example of more and more arcane workarounds bolted on to a failed dogmatic model rather than scrapping it in favor of something that works.\n\n&gt;**You're telling me that \"geocentric theory worked better than heliocentric,\" and that's completely wrong - it's precisely because it worked so poorly that Kepler and Galileo strove to improve on it.** You can't have made the claim you did while knowing anything about the topic, so I'm assured you don't know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;This is a highly instructive example of how the MO practiced by followers of churchly doctrine was not just not scientific in a way even Jesus-contemporary Greeks would have recognized, but actually counterproductive to actual useful research. Shoehorning reality to fit dogma is what Creationists are still doing today, and what makes them the laughing stock of the educated world.\n\nI bolded the most pertinent points. You see...\n\n&gt;The astronomy **Aristoteles and Ptolmey** ...  **You're telling me that \"geocentric theory worked better than heliocentric,\" and that's completely wrong - it's precisely because it worked so poorly that Kepler and Galileo strove to improve on it.** \n\nAristotle was a Greek philosopher and scientist. Aristotle was born in 384 BC. \n\nThis is *NINETEEN* fucking centuries in between Galileo and Aristotle-- this NukeThePope is holding up the ideas of philosophers of nearly *FOUR CENTURIES AND TWO MILLENIA AGO* as an example of how poorly geocentrism \"worked\" as opposed to the totally awesome ideas of heliocentrism in the *16TH CENTURY*. Not to fall into the whole \"ancient people were stupid sthick\" but this is like finding the kid who sits at the back of the short bus at school and asking him to defend Keynesian economics. And then shitting on him because the poor kid is wondering why a 35-year old man wearing a hat from the 50s is accosting him on his ride to school. Besides, communist garbage like Keynes doesn't need any help to be shit on, Ar-har-har-har.\n\nBelieve it or not, people tend to come up with new ideas after NINETEEN FVCKING CENTURIES. I mean, Jesus Christ, you can conquer the known world and establish a hegemonic empire in but a century. During this amount of time that this has passed, we have:\n\n\n* Alexander the Great is born, and after he comes of age, spreads Hellenism far and wide at the tip of a spear. \n\n* No, to my knowledge, Alexander did not refer to his penis as, \"A Spear\".\n\n* Alexander dies, and his Empire falls some time after that, but not before leaving a lasting Greek influence upon the \nWestern world for millenia to come.\n\n* No, Alexander's bastard children were not all named, \"A Lasting Greek Influence\".\n\n* The ruling regent of the Kingdom of Qin, Ying Zheng has his brilliant generals (thanks Obama Bai Qi) utterly destroy the \nother six kingdoms of the late Warring States period, crowns himself Emperor Qin Shi Huang, establishes the Qin Dynasty, and unifies China under his name.\n\n* After 15 years the dynasty falls apart. No one ever said the Qin were good at their job.\n\n* The rise of Rome.\n\n* Han Dynasty. China has now firmly established its identity.\n\n* Sweet, sweet baby Jesus.\n\n* Lots of Dynasties. I think.\n\n* Pretty sure Africans and Native Americans were just sitting in mud huts or something right around now and scratching \nthemselves with sticks with the leaves still on them. Where was I again? Oh yeah, white people. White people are **awesome.**\n\n* The Fall of Western Rome Empire (no relation: Invention of Feminism)\n\n* Founding of Islam\n\n* The Migration Period\n\n* Charles Martel halts the Umayyad Caliphate's advance into France at the Battle of Tours, turning aside Muslim influence and setting the stage for the Carolingian Empire to take root, and the Carolingian Renaissance under Charlemange to flourish.\n\n* Song Dynasty or something. Whatever, they're all gonna be Mongol chow in a few centuries anyways. Spoiler Alert.\n\n* Pope Urban II starts the first crusade after years of internal conflict between Christians in order to consolidate power under the papacy, rid the lands of all these fucking knights, and to assist the Orthodox Christians from aggressions from the East, setting the stages for profitable trade routes to open up to the city states of Italy in particular and eventually, the Renaissance.\n\n* Tyrion is shipped off to Pentos to begin his journey to Meereen to offer his services to Queen Daenerys at the start of Season 5. Um. Spoiler Alert.\n\n* Michelangelo, bestest artist ever, is born and subsequently oblierates the works of all past, present, and future artists with the laser from his transforming sculpting hammer made from the bones of inferior artists (read:all of them) and tempered in the blood of Milanese virgins, called Mjolnir. He was also born at the age of 40, was 8 feet tall and literally made of radiation.\n\n* African people have just invented fire and the missionary position, if r/WorldNews is to be believed. \n\n* The Mongols conquer the largest continguous land empire ever seen, stretching their lands from the tundras of Russia to the very doorstep of the Western World.\n\n* And subsequently fall. Hey, all this not-killing-people business is difficult. \n\nAnd more. \nAll this.\nAnd mooooooore.\n\nMeanwhile, in this guy /u/NukeThePope's world, Western astronomers throughout the Ages were presumably spending their days jacking off and browsing nsfw subreddits; hoping against hope that no one at their payroll company has remembered to stop sending them paychecks. After 19 centuries of furious masturbation, Copernicus and Galileo suddenly barge in upon their Emma Watson, semen-encrusted paradise and they realize they actually have to do shit for once in their life.\n\nYou have this theory.\n\nOr maybe this guy is just talking out of his ass.\n\nI got you now, [pepe le'bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14J3esvACe4).\n\nThis is all, of course, ignoring the numerous problems with Heliocentrim, Galileo's in particular, who this guy has to reach all the way back into the 3rd and 4th centuries B.C. to find something more ridiculous than.\n\n&gt;The astronomy Aristoteles and Ptolmey was based on heavenly bodies attached to perfect (there's that word again) spinning spheres. The problem with this model, of course, is that it fails to accurately account for the apparent motion of the planets - the movement of the Earth relative to their common origin introduces some embarrassing perturbations. **Ptolmey's \"solution\" was to introduce even more \"perfect\" spherical entities to add some extra wiggle. Here was a typical example of more and more arcane workarounds bolted on to a failed dogmatic model rather than scrapping it in favor of something that works.**\n\nIt kind of troubles me that there exists a man alive who can argue, with not a trace of sarcasm, irony, nor self-awareness, against natural philosophic observations made by a man in Alexandria  nearly two-thousand years ago. Does he realize he is belittling the scientific ideas of a man who would have read about Jesus' death in the obituiaries section of the newpaper? \n\nAnd it's not like there wasn't plenty of dumb stuff from Galileo, either. Galileo believed that the *tides* were a reason for why the Earth was revolving around the sun, for fucks sake. And when confronted with some serious objections to his hypothesis, Galileo plugged his ears, went \"lalala I can't hear you and these mathematic equations are just so perfect tho\". I will be quoting from this excellent essay, *But Still, It Moves: Tides, Stellar Parallax, and Galileo's Commitment to the Copernican Theory*.\n\n&gt;[Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) argued in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems of 1632 that tides are direct evidence for the Earth’s motion, because the Earth is both rotating about its own axis and revolving about the Sun.](http://legacy.jefferson.kctcs.edu/faculty/graney/cmgresearch/physicsastro/PIPGalileoforWeb.pdf)\n\nHa. What an idiot, right? Everyone knows that model would lead readers to \"expect to see one high tide and one low tide each day instead of the two that actually occur, and that the time of day at which tides occur varies slowly over the course of a year as the Earth revolves around the Sun instead of over the course of a month as the Moon revolves around the Earth. \" Duh. It's just *science*. Ha-ha-ha. (source: Computer Science major, by proxy: oceanographer.)\n\n.\n.\nContinued below.",

I mean, short modern teaching of the Bible compared to 11th century European theology would be totally adequate, and \"basic sciences\" would totally allow you to do all sorts of great things!\n\n&gt;Level 2: I find the nearest monastery and easily convince them that I am a priest from another land. Vow of silence, poverty, humility, virtue and all that jazz. I am very familiar with the Bible in Latin. None of this is an issue. They accept me immediately.\n\nIt'll be rather hard to convince them of a vow of *silence* when you can't *talk* to them.  Oh, and being \"familiar with the Bible in Latin\" isn't nearly the same as \"solid grasp of medieval theology\", which would be needed for acceptance.\n\n&gt;Level 3: Get some flour, eggs, and oil, completely revolutionize medieval diet with the invention of pasta. Shit's awesome. Everybody loves me. Nobility far and wide welcome me on their land.\n\nYes, innovations spread *instantly* in a day when people needed horses to get from A to B.  Hell, centuries later when roads were safer and more developed, it took decades for fashion and innovations to spread from Italy to France and England and become at all accepted.\n\n&gt;Level 4: In my free time I slap together some inventions. Draw up the designs for a printing press and start selling Bibles. The local alchemist can get me some saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal, so I delight the lord of the land with fireworks in his honor.\n\nIf he's a priest, I'm trying to figure out where he has that kind of free time.  And if he's supposed to be travelling all over entertaining nobility because 11th Century Twitter made him famous, I'm trying to figure out how he can have the time to do any of this.  Also, alchemy wasn't introduced to Europe until the 13th century, so he's around 200 years too early to have an alchemist around, and it's not like the local blacksmith had the time or resources to make a printing press.  Oh, and alchemists really did know about gunpowder rather shortly after the introduction of alchemy, because that was one of the things that got funding quickly.  So, if there were alchemists that he had access to, they'd already have gunpowder, and yes, there would be bombards already being worked on.\n\n&gt;Level 5: I am now a trusted and highly valued member of society. I have been given a plot of land with plenty of workers and full access to the local blacksmiths and alchemists. I have them make me some more fireworks powder and machine parts... That's not what they are at all...\n\nWhat the living hell?  Who did this, and why?  Because he *made pasta* once?\n\n&gt;Level 6: Easily conquer the lord's forces with only a few loyal men because I have the only rifles and cannons in Europe for the next several hundred years. Take more land, get more resources, repeat. Most people gladly surrender to my rule. I establish an empire based on fairness and progress, and treat my subjects better than everybody else.\n\nIt gets dumber, faster.  Rifles need advanced metallurgy and casting techniques, not to mention milling and other technologies that didn't exist at the time, so *even if* he could get gunpowder from alchemists 200 years before there were alchemists in Europe, he'd get at best handgonnes, which were really not that great.  Maybe arquebuses, but also not great.  Also, without good supporting arms, you'd never win a fight either--you'd see your gunners dead from arrows or cavalry right quick.  \n\nOh, and he seems to think that campaigns would happen very quickly, and not all be dependent on weather, harvests, supplies, marching capabilities, etc.  I'm trying to figure out his timeframe here, because this is looking like 100 years already, so he might just be immortal to begin with.\n\n&gt;Level 7: Assemble a navy. Bring European civilization to Africa and the New World a few centuries early and establish colonies without enslaving or wiping out the natives. Welcome the clamoring Asian masses into my lucrative global trade empire. Allow relative autonomy and protection against infighting to everybody under my flag.\n\nAnd he's now a master shipwright and navigator, able to make a ship capable of sailing the Atlantic *and* surviving it.  Oh, and he can train navigators and pilots to take the ship to where he says land is and no one believes is there.  And this doesn't at all take years once it starts out, and that also assumes that everyone wants what he wants and will totally just let him be in charge.\n\n&gt;Step 8: The world is mine. The Middle-Ages are cut in half. The Industrial Revolution happens alongside the Renaissance. My progeny will land on the moon before Columbus would have landed in the Americas because I knew how to make pasta.\n\nSo, cut in half would still be a hundred years after he arrived, so he'd be dead before any of this happened, and the level of *what drugs was he on when he came up with this nonsense* I cannot comprehend.  It's just a continual \"let's get dumber\".\n\nBut, hey, it gets gold.",

        "author": "CarterAggie",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2gsotm/tumblr_on_alan_turing_and_apple/",
        "text": "[Full Link to Tumblr Post](http://samrgarrett.tumblr.com/post/26541461901/outofthecavern-opiatevampire)\n\nAlan Turing was a 20th century British mathematician, logician, but his fame comes from his work as a cryptoanalyst and his success in designing and improving techniques for deciphering German Code during the Second World War. \n\nThe discussion stems from [This](http://imgur.com/P3JcVIW) picture from The Pride Network.\n\nI do not know much about computers or their history, so I will not discuss whether or not Alan Turing's influence on Computer Science is as great as the picture suggests. Instead I will correct a few incorrect allegations made in the computer and in the subsequent posts. \n\n&gt; In 1954 homosexuality was illegal. Turing was given a choice between imprisonment or to undergo hormonal treatment.  He committed suicide.\n\nThis portion of the text is not a completely accurate portrayal of what happened in regards to the timeline of the events as well as Turing's course of action.\n\nIn January of 1952 Turing began a relationship with Arnold Murray.  Later that month, his home was burglarized by an acquaintance of Murray's.  When Turing informed the authorities he eventually revealed his informant and the nature of their relationship, after having been accused of lying by the Detectives. (Hodges 457)  Turing was charged under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 for the crime of Gross Indecency. (Hodges 458) Alan wrote to his brother John, informing him of the circumstances and his plan to plead \"not guilty\".  His brother headed to Manchester and met with a \"leading firm of solicitors\" who helped him convince Alan to plead guilty.  In March of that year Alan was convicted and given the choice between imprisonment or hormonal treatments of estrogen. Turing accepted the hormonal treatments, which eventually made him impotent and develop breasts.  It was two years later on June 8, 1954 Alan Turing was found dead, due to cyanide poisoning.  The most accepted theory is that he poisoned an apple that he usually ate before going to bed, but some have pointed to a theory suggesting that he might have accidentally inhaled cyanide during one of his experiments.  \n\nSo differing from what the photograph states, Turing was convicted in 1952, he did choose to receive the hormonal therapy, and then he is believed to have killed himself. \n\nNow on to the tumblr comments!\n\n&gt; He committed suicide by biting into a cyanide laced apple. This is supposedly the inspiration for the name/logo of Apple computers.\n\nWhile it is believed that Turing did commit suicide by biting into a cyanide laced apple, this did not have an impact on the name or logo for Apple computers. Steve Jobs claimed that he came up with the name while coming back from an apple farm while on a fruit diet. He thought that the name sounded \"fun, spirited and not intimidating.\" (CBCNews) In fact, the companies [first logo](http://imgur.com/4yf5GYB) was a picture of Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. The [second logo](http://imgur.com/hnAk8bj), adopted a month later in May of 1976, depicts the more well known rainbow apple. Rob Janoff, the designer of the second logo, gave an interview where he explained the origins of the design when asked if there was any religious theme behind it in regards to the story of Adam and Eve.\n\n&gt; Well, I'm probably the least religious person, so Adam and Eve didn't have anything to do with it. The bite of knowledge sounds fabulous, but that's not it. And, there is a whole lot of other lure about it. Turing the famous supposed father of computer science who committed suicide in the early 50's was british and was accused of being homosexual, which he was. He was facing a jail sentence so he committed suicide to avoid all that. So, I heard one of the legends being that the colored logo was an homage to him. People think I did the colored stripes because of the gay flag. And, that was something really thought for a long time. The other really cool part was that apparently he killed himself with a cyanide laced apple. And, then I found out Alan Turing's favorite childhood story was Snow White where she falls asleep forever for eating a poisoned apple to be woken up by the handsome prince. Anyway, when I explain the real reason why I did the bite it's kind of a let down. But I'll tell you. I designed it with a bite for scale, so people get that it was an apple not a cherry. Also it was kind of iconic about taking a bite out of an apple. Something that everyone can experience. It goes across cultures. If anybody ever had an apple he probably bitten into it and that's what you get. It was after I designed it, that my creative director told me: \"Well you know, there is a computer term called byte\". And I was like: \"You're kidding!\" So, it was like perfect, but it was coincidental that it was also a computer term. At the time I had to be told everything about basic computer terms.\n\nJanoff states that the allegations regarding Turing's connection to the Apple Logo are merely coincidence, saying that the reason the apple had a bite taken out of it was \"so people get that it was an apple not a cherry.\"\n\nAs Janoff mentioned many, such as the tumblr user quoted below, thought that the color of the logo was a also a tribute to Turing, representing the stripes of the gay flag.\n\n&gt; omfg\n&gt; \n&gt; omfg\n&gt; \n&gt; and old Apple computers\n&gt; \n&gt; the apple was a rainbow \n\nYes it was, but for different reasons. In the same interview Rob Janoff, when asked if the colors were influenced by the hippie movement, gives the following reasons for the choice of a multicolored apple.\n\n&gt; RJ: Partially it was a really big influence. Both Steve and I came from that place, but the real solid reason for the stripes was that the Apple II was the first home or personal computer that could reproduce images on the monitor in color. So it represents color bars on the screen. Also, it was an attempt to make the logo very accessible to everyone, especially to young people so that Steve could get them into schools.\n\n\nTo summarize, even though it makes for a very cool story,  Alan Turing was not the inspiration for Apple's Logo\n\n\n\n\nSources:  [Alan Turing: The Enigma By Andrew Hodges ](http://books.google.com/books?id=HyMcH_9eTtoC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=%2227+february%22+%22alan+turing%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20february%22%20%22alan%20turing%22&amp;f=false) \n\n[CBC News](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/steve-jobs-chose-herbal-medicine-delayed-cancer-surgery-1.1124855)\n\n[creativebits.org](http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo)",

Then, using the tallow from the bison they'd slaughtered, they would fry the skin until it was a bit stiffer, and then stuff it with the rest of the bison meat. It would again be fried and then consumed on special occasions.\n\n\nHonestly, holy fuck, this is the most insane thing I've read on reddit in quite a while. His claims are simple, that pre-columbian people would take scalps from their enemies, shave them, fry them, stuff them with buffalo meat and eat it. Except they didn't. There's no record of that happening in any tribe, anywhere. Scalps were occasionally taken, yes, but it was for two purposes, as an act of terror, and to take as a trophy. Archaeological evidence shows that during times of war villages would be raided and the women and children killed and ritualistically mutilated, hands and feet cut off and scalped. As trophies, warriors would take scalps from at least their first kill, some warriors would take more. But absolutely none of them ate them. Cannibalism is one of the biggest taboos in many American Indian cultures, with many saying that those who consumed human flesh would turn into insatiable monsters with a craving for human flesh, aka the Wendigo, or the Wechuge or any number of mythical beasts that arise from the act of cannibalism. This is just one of many cases of colonial myths sticking around for far to long.",

It was one of the main reasons the Plague killed millions.\n\nA few problems here:\n\n1. There isn't much evidence of black-cat pogroms in the period in connection with superstition surrounding the plague. The linked Wikipedia article doesn't give a quality source for this, instead offering a [poorly-written article authored by someone who clearly doesn't know much about history.](http://www.webcitation.org/62IUxHSsz)\n\n2. Even if the unintended consequence of annihilating black cats helped spread the plague (there's no evidence for this), it's not one of the 'main reasons' an infectious disease spread through European populations.\n\n3. Felicide committed against specifically black cats wouldn't have a major effect on the rat population and the spread of the disease.\n\nI'm on mobile and don't want to spend a lot of time ripping apart the article's abundant nonsense or the TIL comments, but I'll throw in [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2gltuh/til_during_the_middle_ages_thousands_of_black/ckkktft) that pretty much gets it right:\n\n&gt;I've studied the plague pretty extensively, and there are a number of misconceptions regarding it and also this TIL. One: we have no evidence with the exception of one written source (perhaps two) talking about a man being paid to kill rats. The medieval plague was much more virulent than the modern plague, and paleoepidemologists and historians think that given the evidence, it was likely transmitted from person to person. There may have been other modes of communication for the disease, but we are unsure at this point.\nIn fact, the medieval plague is SO different than the modern plague that for several decades it was argued that the medieval plague wasn't Y. pestis at all. That is, until 2011 when a mass grave filled with plague victims was found next to the Royal Mint in London, and out of the 700 odd skeletons they tested, they found 5 teeth with intact dental pulp to test for the disease (since it lives in the blood vessels, but those usually aren't preserved). They found that it was an extinct strain of Y. pestis, which is why it was so different.\n\n&gt;IN ADDITION, there have been cat massacres, but IIRC there is little evidence regarding them during the plague.\n\n&gt;The plague killed millions because it spread from Italy to Northern Europe within a year or two and no one had acquired immunity. While the plague had continued to kill people, the death tolls decreased over time. I can tell you though that I've studied the demographics of the plague, and with each wave over the next few centuries (it came in waves every decade or so), the people who were most affected were children. Strangely enough, the disease seemed to target men more than women, but AFAIK there isn't much in the way of explaining that. It's hard to study a strain of bacteria that's dead.\n\n&gt;And you know, if you look at the wiki article this TIL was taken from, the citation for this has a note next to it saying that this fact was NOT in the citation.\n\n&gt;TL;DR: The medieval plague was not spread by rats, and there is very little evidence about massacring cats during the plague years.\n\nThe plague was indeed spread by rats, but not solely.",

        "text": "People, we've been hoodwinked. Scammed. Bamboozled. That famous white building you know as the 'Taj Mahal', ya? BULLSHIT. It's not actually a Mausoleum at all, it's the repurposed temple of Shiva, known as the Tejo Mahalay! From the people who brought you such timeless badhistories as: \"Christianity and Islam are both actually derivatives of Hinduism\", [The *True* Story of the Taj Mahal](http://www.stephen-knapp.com/true_story_of_the_taj_mahal.htm)!!!!!\n\nExcept, you know, it's bullshit. P.N. Oak in his work delineates hundreds of astute points on how the entire Taj Mahal history and conventional understanding is a fabrication. The Taj Mahal was actually a pre existing Shiva Temple that was repurposed, is his ultimate claim. Now, I don't have the time to address all of them, but here are some I found particularly...interesting. \n\nwe start off right off the bat with:\n\n\n&gt;  * 1. The term Tajmahal itself never occurs in any mogul court paper or chronicle even in Aurangzeb's time. The attempt to explain it away as Taj-i-mahal is therefore, ridiculous.\n\nProvided this is true (something by no means absurd), thats still quite a mental leap.  He 'debunks' in the rest of this section the falsehoods surrounding the name of the Taj Mahal. But lets for a second assume that the entire word is a lie, lets play the semantics game. That still doesn't necessarily mean the building is a lie. Words have a way of changing from time to time, from society to society. It wouldn't be the first time that something was remembered by a name other than what it was originally called. Like, say, the Mughal Empire itself..which was self stylized Gurkhani. Remembered as Mughal because thats what they were known as by the the Persians- a corruption of the word 'Mongol'.  Notice how the name we call it has changed, but that Empire is still the same historical Empire, not a Hindu Temple suddenly. My example may seem arbitrary, but the point is he is jumping to wild conclusions from the very beginning. This conflation of semantics and historicity and his bad grasp on both topics is exemplified in this point: \n&gt; * 4. Since the lady's name was Mumtaz (ending with 'Z') the name of the building derived from her should have been Taz Mahal, if at all, and not Taj (spelled with a 'J').\n\nWell, no, her name wasn't 'Mumtaz Mahal'. Thats the English transliteration of ممتاز محل. Arjumand Begum aka Mumtaz Mahal was a Persian princess from the early 17th century, I would be shocked if her name ended with the letter 'Z'. This isn't even badhistory, this is  badlogic. \n\nThe non-sequiter, swiss-cheese logic doesn't stop there. It thrives all throughout the theory. For example, \n\n&gt; * 34. A wooden piece from the riverside doorway of the Taj subjected to the carbon 14 test by an American Laboratory, has revealed that the door to be 300 years older than Shahjahan,since the doors of the Taj, broken open by Muslim invaders repeatedly from the 11th century onwards, had to b replaced from time to time. The Taj edifice is much more older. It belongs to 1155 A.D, i.e., almost 500 years anterior to Shahjahan.\n\nWow, it's almost like trees can live for a long time before they are repurposed into thing by Humans much, much younger than them. Apparently a piece of wood from a door was carbon dated by American Scientists (citation needed), and it is much much older than Shah Jahan, the emperor who commissioned the building. But Oak then makes the claim the edifice was built in 1155, 500 years earlier. No mention of American Scientists either. I just don't see how you can possibly come to that claim of the unsourced dating of a door.\n\nHonestly, I have a problem with nearly every single point made in this theory. There is some logical or historical oversight that can called out on 9/10 bullet points, and I could spend all day doing that. But Im going to wrap this up with a spotlight on something a bit more 'concrete' than semantics: the actual Architecture. \n\nIm gonna rattle off a few of his architectural claims regarding the Tejo Mahalay: \n\n&gt; * A central dome with cupolas at its four corners is a universal feature of Hindu temples.\"\n\n&gt; * The embossed patterns on the marble exterior of the centotaph chamber wall are foilage of the conch shell design and the Hindu letter \"OM\". The octagonally laid marble lattices inside the centotaph chamber depict pink lotuses on their top railing. The Lotus, the conch and the OM are the sacred motifs associated with the Hindu deities and temples.\"\n\n&gt; * The Tajmahal has a reverberating dome. Such a dome is an absurdity for a tomb which must ensure peace and silence. Contrarily reverberating domes are a neccesity in Hindu temples because they create an ecstatic dinmultiplying and magnifying the sound of bells, drums and pipes accompanying the worship of Hindu deities.\"\n\nThese are only three among many that show how much of his theoretical process relies on these false assumption about things, and how much of it is looking too far into things. Conch Shell? \"OM\"? Really?\nHe can't seem to grasp that different peoples can arrive at similar architectural styles and motifs without being the same people. The most egregious is when he speaks on Domes. I mean, it's not like any other culture/religion/architectural style involved heavy use of Domes..oh wait. You don't even have to look beyond the Mughals. \n\n[This is the Taj Mahal](http://images.boomsbeat.com/data/images/full/2675/46-jpg.jpg). Judging by his appraisal, its obviously a Hindu Temple ripoff. So its rather strange that all of its 'sibling' works would look so..similar. Compare with:\n\n* [The Red Fort](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Red_Fort_2.jpg)\n\n* [Jama Masjid](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8LYttHncgxo/Ud1R_xvYm5I/AAAAAAAAAUw/wrkb3-4p53o/s1600/Jama_Masjid_Delhi.JPG)\n\n* [Bibi ka Maqbara](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Bibi_ka_Maqbara.JPG)\n\n* [Agra Fort](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Uttar-Pradesh-Agra-Agra-Fort-Jahangiri-mahal-Apr-2004-00.JPG)\n\nI can post dozens of more examples, but you get the point. Just comparing the Taj with its sisters, we can only arrive at one of 2 conclusions:\n\n1.) The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughals, the same people who built all the other similar buildings associated with them.\n\n2.) These buildings and the dozens others like em are all, in fact, Hindu Temples to Shiva. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I ran across [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2gf7zw/eli5_why_is_the_hatred_towards_jews_called/ckip4s7) in askreddit, in which the a comment claims:\n\n&gt;Semites are defined by their language group and ethnicity, not race, that only partially overlaps with religion. The majority of Semites are not Jews and the majority of Jews are not Semites.\n\nNow I agree that Semitic is generally used to refer to linguistic and ethnic groups, not race (though it _was_ historically used in that way).  And given the relative number of Jews and people living in that area of the Middle East, I'd agree that most Semitic peoples, however you choose to use the term, are not Jews.  \n\nBut the idea that the majority of Jews are not Semites does not follow, especially since Jews themselves were the first group to which the name Semitic was applied.  It's right there in [the definition](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semite) of Semite: \n\n&gt;a member of a group of people originally of southwestern Asia that includes Jews and Arabs\n\nJews are practically Semites _by definition_, and indeed it's their own religious heritage that has the story of Shem and his descendants.  As a group, they historically speak a Semitic language and still use it for religious purposes.  The argument seems to be that because you can join the Jewish religion, therefore most Jews are do not qualify as Semitic.  But for that to be true, most Jews would have had to be converts...and this conversion would have had to have taken place in such a way that the Semitic nature of Jewish ethnic groups was destroyed.  After all, people move to regions, marry and interact with people within an ethnic group, and join the group.  As the author himself admits, ethnic groups are not the same thing as race (whatever that is).\n\n\nA later comment (by a different author) goes further, saying:\n\n&gt;The European heritage ones. Ie Polish, Russian, German etc. Semite refers to genetics but religions spread without genetics ergo Jews that aren't technically semites.\n\n&gt;Most Semite communities who were Jews converted to Islam in the last ~1200 years\n\nApparently not satisfied with the idea of \"Semitic\" as a word for a group of languages, he claims it _is_ a genetic grouping.  Now, there are some genetic similarities among the people regarded as Semites today, and arguably the term originated in a genetic sense \"Sons of Shem\"...but certainly in the modern context it's used to refer to people speaking a certain group of languages.\n\nHe claims \"religions spread without genetics ergo Jews aren't technically Semites\".  Just because languages _can_ spread without genetics does not mean they do always spread without genetics.  It's illogical to say \"It's possible to convert to Judaism, ergo all Jews are converts.\"  And in fact numerous genetic studies have found that Ashkenazi Jews _do_ in fact make up a distinct population that maintains genetic links to Middle Eastern populations (Link [1](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140909/ncomms5835/full/ncomms5835.html), [2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929710002466)).  Even those that claim they are not related to middle eastern peoples claim they originated from Khazars, who are hardly European, much less German or Polish.  \n\n&gt;I don't think you understand the concept of religion (where anyone can convert and become Jewish) and genetics (which are unchangeable once they are set).\n\nThis one is just badlogic.  Again, just because it's possible to convert and become Jewish does not mean that most Jews are converts or the descendants of converts.  And even if that _was_ true, it wouldn't necessarily exclude them from a being in a Semitic ethnic group, any more than we would exclude the descendants of Normans from the English ethnic group just because their ancestor weren't all Angles or Saxons.  \n\nEDIT:\n\nAlmost missed one: we can get some badhistory from both sides\n\nAn opposing comment says:\n\n&gt;What are you talking about, all people born to a family of any Jewish history is a semite. There has been numerous historical and genetic tests to prove this. http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140909/ncomms5835/full/ncomms5835.html\n\nThis commenter seems to be claiming that no family has ever converted to Judaism, and 100% of Jews are descendants of that middle eastern group, which is [clearly not the case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_converts_to_Judaism).  I think you could especially make the argument that groups like the [Abayudaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abayudaya) are Jewish but not Semitic.   Don't make overly broad statements.  That's what got me irritated at this thread in the first place.  \n",

(serious)](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29hn7u/whats_the_most_amazing_yet_unexplained_event_in/) As you might imagine, what I found was not fun or interesting urban legends, but rather a set of mysteries that are really quite easily explainable, even with the most basic bit of research. Because I am feeling tetchy, I will answer every question and, as much as I am able, only use Wikipedia while doing so.\n\n&gt;The identity of the Sea Peoples.\n\nI'll be starting off a little weak, because to a degree this is a genuine mystery, and historians are not certain of the precise origins of the Sea Peoples. The Wikipedia page linked to offers a number of more or less plausible hypotheses, although it is worth noting that large migrations tend to pick up remorra like followers (cf the [Gepids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepids)). So I'll leave this, but luckily one of the responses was this:\n\n&gt;&gt;Historians have a good idea of the why but not the who. Around that time Thera (Santorini) blew up.\n\nThera was [several centuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption) before the Sea Peoples. It is a terrible explanation for the Minoan collapse, and an even worse one for the general Bronze Age collapse.\n\n&gt;How about the Great Leap Forward? All of a sudden, out of the blue, about 40,000 years ago we develop cave painting, music, burial, simple jewelery (clay beads and the like). No evidence I'm aware of showing any of that before then.\n\nWhat is being referred to here is [behavioral modernity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity). As the Wiki page notes, the time before ~50,000 BP was not so bereft as all that--decorative shells, signs of nets, pigments, etc have been found in scattered finds. It is worth noting that the famous European cave paintings are actually a discrete set of creations, as they stop at a certain point, and so they should be viewed as a specific cultural production, not a general marker of human development. The best explanation I have heard (stepping out of Wiki) is that around 50,000 BP population density was high enough that technological developments could easily be transmitted between groups, whereas before somebody might invent a net but the knowledge had a chance to be lost.\n\n&gt;I wish we knew more about the rise and fall of the Incas. Being able to develop a city like Machu Picchu buried deep within the Andes Mountains, with engineered lands for farming and massive stone formations, while only lasting for about 85 years before the city was completely abandoned.\n\nThe Inca are a very well studied culture, and most notably, they are not unique in Andean history. They did not exist in a vacuum and were preceded by a long series of advanced and complex cultures, perhaps most directly the [Wari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_Empire), whose road network the Inca substantially built upon.\n\n&gt;Linguistically, the Great Vowel shift. For an unknown reason during the Middle Ages the British speakers of English changed virtually all vowel pronunciations over the short span of 1-2 generations. Incredible cultural mystery.\n\n[The Great Vowel Shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift), as the first sentence of Wiki relates, occurred not over two generations but over several centuries. It is an interesting and linguistically well studied phenomenon, but there is not strange about language changing.\n\n&gt;Antikythera Mechanism. It's an analog computer dating back 2000 years ago that was used to display astronomical cycles. Nothing as complex as it was seen for another 1000 years.\n\nThe 1000 years is sort of arbitrary, but whatever. The [Hellenistic is interesting] because people at that time loved gizmos and doodads. The Antikythera Mechanism is remarkable, but not out of step with [technological whizbangs of the period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period#Sciences). Although it is somewhat later than the technical end of the period, Roman era inventors such as [Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) are good representatives of this tendency.\n\n&gt;Supposedly thousands of medieval people saw [this artist depiction](http://subharanjangupta.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ufo-history-008.jpg) in the sky accompanied by noises and flashes of light.\n\nCan someone help me here? I don't see what is strange about this. Isn't it just a picture of the sun and stars? I'm a little lost.\n\n&gt;The Voynich manuscript is a pretty interesting one.\n\nFair.\n\n&gt;I submit the 12,000 year old city of Gobekli Tepe - Who built it? Why? Where did they go?\n\nOut of respect for the recently deceased Dr. Schmidt I will not refer to Gobekli with any of my usual epithets. Gobekli is a fascinating site that challenged several assumptions that were common about pre-agricultural peoples. It is worth noting that the animals carved on the pillars are perfectly typical of the environment f the period, and so the obvious answer of \"who built it\" is pretty clearly \"the people around there\". It is also worth noting that it is next to a massive flint source and that the quarry for the pillars is about a five minute walk away from the site.\n\nIn a way, however, it isn't quite so weird as all that.

        "text": "First some back story. The [.41 Remington Magnum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.41_Remington_Magnum) is a personal favorite of mine. It's about a perfect middle ground between .357 and .44, and given the right loads can pretty much do anything any of those loads can do. But with more *style*. It's the refined person's magnum. It's the magnum revolver a person who sips tea with their pinky finger sticking out carries. It's not a \"Do you feel lucky punk?\" cartridge it's more of a \"I'm terribly sorry to bother you sir, but could you please place your hands behind your head?\" cartridge. British policemen would carry a .41 magnum, because it's just that fucking classy. \n\nAnyway, the story behind the cartridge takes us back to the dark days of the 1960's, when cops carried low powered revolvers, and generally were outgunned by a kid with a water pistol. While the .357 was catching on for it's stopping power (and them new fangled semi autos dating back 50-60 years hadn't quite caught on, except for the venerable 1911 here and there), the round had not been fully developed to it's modern day near perfection.  Enter three great men; Skeeter Skelton, Elmer Keith, and Bill Jordan. Now these men were and are legends in the shooting sports world. Skelton and Jordan were former lawmen, who worked in isolated rural areas, and Keith was a famous marksman and cartridge designer. All three were noted marksmen and highly knowledgeable on the fine art of the combat handgun.  In 1963, this holy trinity got together, and petitioned Smith and Wesson to create the .41 magnum. Designed from the ground up to fill any roll from self defense/police work, to hunting large North American game, it should have filled any legitimate roll a person might have for a handgun.\n\nIt flopped.\n\nWhich is where the Bad History(TM) comes in. \n\nWhile doing some research for my own personal use (Deer and elk season is coming!) I found a little gem on a normally respectable [forum](http://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=61291)  \"The perfect defensive bullet is suppose to be a 40 caliber projectile weighing 200 grains and traveling at 900 to 1000 feet per second. Or at least that was the original model Elmer Keith, Skeeter Skelton, and Bill Jordan had in mind when 41 Magnum came into existence. But due to the legal issues surrounding the name \"Magnum\", the cartridge failed to catch on.\" I'll skip over the bad ballistics, .40-.410 is a nice compromise for a number of reasons, but by no means the perfect defensive bullet. Of more interest to this sub is the absurd claim that \"Due to the legal issues surrounding the name Magnum...\"\n\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha.\n\nHere, we would be asked to believe that three of the greatest names in 20th century combat handgun and target shooting failed to get their handcrafted creation off the ground by virtue of a single word.  Remington wound up building the cartridge, and Smith and Wesson offered guns for it.  \n\nSmith fucked it up. Remington helped.  You see, despite the clever ideas for a lower powered police cartridge (which was still more powerful than any .357 on the market, and would work in a similar weight handgun) both companies decided to kick it up a notch. Remington loaded a hotter round for defensive work, and Smith built a heavier framed gun better suited for hunting than defense. The end result? A gun with the weight of a .44 magnum, and a cartridge too powerful for regular police work.  This killed any chance the .41 magnum had of achieving market success.  Did you note that it was called \".41 magnum\" from the get go? That's right. A single word had nothing to do with it's reception by the market. The fact was, it's primary market (cops and law abiding citizens) were offered a too heavy and too powerful gun, while the hunting market had plenty of other well established choices to choose from. Once you cut off your primary market, you've got nowhere to go, but downhill.  \n\nAnd then 50 years later, some moron comes along, and blames it all on nonexistent trademark issues.  Now if you'll excuse me, my tea is done. \n\n",

Our growing knowledge of early maritime technology and its accomplishments gives us confidence that vessels and nautical skills capable of these long-distance travels were developed by the times indicated. These voyages put a new complexion on the extensive Old World/New World cultural parallels that have long been controversial.\n\n\nI'm not an expert but it sounds very fringe like, since in the links that were cited in the linked tumblr post they only talk about the age of boats. One link in particular was from National Geographic talking about quartz tools found in [Crete](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100217-crete-primitive-humans-mariners-seafarers-mediterranean-sea/). It mentions seaworthy vessels which could have sailed the Mediterranean Sea or the Red Sea earlier than thought. Tumblr of course runs with it and assumes that a Egyptian boat which could make the trip through the Mediterranean Sea would survive the months long voyage to the Americas.  \n\nKeith Fitzpatrick-Matthews brings up another point on his [blog](https://badarchaeology.wordpress.com/tag/pre-columbian/)\n\n&gt; To return to the main subject of this post, why do I find the evidence for all pre-Columbus contact between the Old and New Worlds unconvincing, with the one exception of L’Anse aux Meadows? **Because of the lack of rubbish.** If there is one thing that humans do well, that is to litter the surface of our home planet (and we’re beginning to spread out litter to the Moon, Mars and elsewhere…). If there were large numbers of Europeans (or Asians, or Africans) in the Americas before Columbus, they couldn’t have avoided leaving their litter. Forget texts: they are too easily forged. It’s rubbish that we need!\n\n\nThe mummy with nicotine and coca has been pretty debunked, since plants with nicotine were known to the Egyptians and the coca was contamination from non-sterile handling practices I believe? \n\nRegardless, the post is very popular on tumblr and encourages bad history, especially with many of the rebloggers adding comments like \n\n&gt; Black People know how to go visit somewhere without fucking everything up.. What a concept… \n\n&gt; &amp; would you look at that? seems like they didn’t try to take land that wasn’t theirs &amp; brutally massacre the entire population!",

First of all, how do you even QUANTIFY scientific advancement?

Also, our “technological advancement” didn’t drop during the “Christian Dark Ages.” That view is problematic AS FUCK because it only focuses on Western Europe. Tell me, have you heard of the Byzantine Empire? The Abbasid Caliphate? The Chinese Tang and Song dynasties? They were during the “Christian dark ages”, and they invented and kept a lot of information that was supposedly “lost” at the time. Also, do ANY OF Y’ALL know who Charlemagne is? He was a Christian (like, REALLY christian) during the “dark ages” and he sponsored learning and teaching. Also Charlemagne wasn’t the only one doing things in Europe, inventions and progress were being made during the “dark ages”, so this chart is 100% bogus.\n\nSorry about that, had to get it out of my system",

[But apparently things have just gotten a lot worse](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/texas-text-books-complain-about-taxes-downplay-segregation)\n\nThe gist is that Conservatives on the Texas Board of Education have released new text books that have a few problems, problems that we often correct here.\n\n[Here is the official scholarly critique cited in the article](http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/FINAL_executivesummary.pdf?docID=4625)\n\nSome highlights\n\n1.  A number of the books exaggerate the influece that Christianity had on the founding of western political tradition.\n\n2. Two included misleading info that undermines the Constitutional concept of the separation of church and state.\n\n3. Several books make biased statements that negatively portray Islam\n\n4. All of the textbooks downplay the role of conquest in the spread of Christianity\n\n5. Several books gave incomplete or inaccurate information about religions other than Christianity.\n\n6. Multiple books ignore the legitimate problems of Capitalism and fail to include the role US government played in Economics. \n\n7. One book “flirts with contemporary Tea Party ideology\".\n\n8. One book offers outdated—and possibly offensive—anthropological categories and racial terminology in describing African civilizations.\n\n9. Many of the US history books gave little to no attention to Native American peoples and occasionally included biased or misleading information.\n\n10. One government textbook (Pearson) includes a biased verging on offensive treatment of affirmative action.\n\n11. Undue legitimacy is given to neo-Confederate arguments about ‘states’ rights’  and the legacy of slavery in the South.\n\nEDIT: Here is a more specific analysis. I will go in order of the TL;DR above. I realized that I was slacking off in my original post and If I wasn’t doing this I'd just be writing a history paper. It is history related so its kinda not procrastination \n\nI ^^have ^^^so ^^^^much ^^^^^on ^^^^^^my ^^^^^^^plate\n\n**#1 and 2 or, \"Everything civilized comes from the Bible\"**\n\nTo start off, here is the offending passage from the   McGraw-Hill text\n\n&gt; The \"biblical idea of a covenant, an ancient Jewish  term meaning a special kind of agreement between  people and  God,  influenced  the  formation  of  colonial  governments  and  contributed  to  our  constitutional  structure.”\n\nI feel like they were thinking \"If we state this vaguely enough it cant be wrong.\" Anyway, the problem is they are completely skipping over the entire enlightenment. Locke did base many of his ideas off of biblical scripture but to say our founders plucked their ideas right out of the bible is pretty far from the truth. While Locke wanted a contract between a government and its people, the biblical idea of a political covenant identified the state as a method of reinforcing gods will--Sharia law anyone? Though the opposite is implied by this text, we know or founders were not so fond of mixing religion and politics. As John Adams said while trying to get Ottoman Tripolitania to stop funding The Barbary Corsairs--who were literally ISIS btw. \n\n&gt;\"The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.\"\n\nNext, apparently we have a chart that claims Moses is responsible for the idea that \n\n&gt;“A  nation  needs  a  written  code  of  behaviour\"\n\nBecause fuck [Ur-Nammur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu) and [Hammurabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi) right? Not only did the Mesopotamians have to watch confused as God created a world they had been living on for a few thousand years, they also lost out on creating the first system of hierarchy enforcing law.\n\n\nThe Pearson textbook says\n&gt;  “The  roots  of  democratic  government  in  today’s  world including  government  in  the  United  States lie  deep  in  human  history.  They  reach  back most  particularly  to  ancient  Greece  and  Rome,  and include  elements  related  to  Judeo-­Christian philosophy,  dating  back  thousands  of  years  to  Old Testament  texts  and  Biblical  figures  such  as  Moses and  Solomon.” \n\nSeeing that we all came from communal groups that most likely based decisions off of group consensus, Id actually support the whole \"Lie deep in human history\" thing. However there is nothing to support the claim that the old testament had any influence on the creation of democracy.\n\nAnd then comes the quote I have waited all my life for,\n&gt;  “Moses  helped  establish  a  legal  system, including  the  Ten  Commandments,  to  govern  his  people.  Similarly,  the  founders  of  the  United  States  wrote the  Constitution  and  established  a  system  of  laws to  govern  Americans.  They  were  also  part  of  a  tradition  that  was  familiar  with  the  Ten Commandments  as  a  guide  for  moral  behaviour.\n\nYou know who else made laws and led people?\n\n[Adolph Hitler](http://cp91279.biography.com/1000509261001/1000509261001_1630293503001_BIO-Biography-Adolf-Hitler-SF.jpg)\n\nNext, a McGraw-­Hill says. \n&gt;“Thomas  Jefferson  once  referred  to  the  establishment  clause  as  a  ‘wall  of  separation  between  church  and  state.’  That  phrase  is  not used  in  the  Constitution,  however.\n\nThat is to say, \"Jefferson may have had this view but it wasn’t shared by the cooler, more religious founders.\"\n\n\n**#3 and #4 or, \"\"Islam was spread by the sword; Christianity, via hugs and kisses.**\n\nFirst we start with a pretty low blow,\n\n&gt;“Much  of  the  violence  you  read  or  hear  about  in  the  Middle  East  is  related  to  a  jihad.” \n\nThat is to say, the only reason these people are fighting is because of religion. If only the rest of the world knew that this seemingly complex war was actually so simple.\n\nJihad is literally defined as a struggle against an opponent that is not Islamic, it doesn't actually characterize the entire war as a cosmic struggle or some shit. \nUsing the authors understanding of religious conflict we can safely assume that;\n\n* ~~The Crusades were totally about Religion~~\n\n[/u/Rittermeister has corrected me, It really was mostly about religion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2g5poi/i_think_i_know_where_some_of_this_bad_history_is/ckghkbr)\n\n* Colonization was an effort to save the souls of those poor savages\n\n* The IRA is literally Al-Qa’ida and both fight solely for religious reasons.\n\n* WWI was actually Crusades 2 because Christian Europe fought the Ottomans.\n\n\nMore of it here\n&gt; “The  spread  of  international  terrorism  is  an  outgrowth  of  Islamic  fundamentalism which  opposes  Western political  and  cultural  influences  and  Western  ideology.\"\n\nAgain, America is being bullied because we are ^just ^^so ^^^different.\n\nMisrepresenting Islamic culture here,\n&gt;\"The  chador  limits  women’s  interactions  in  public  as  it  makes  them  indistinguishable  from  one  another  and  inhibits  any  kind  of  contact.\"\n\nActually, [the chandor does not do that at all.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Women_in_shiraz_2.jpg/1024px-Women_in_shiraz_2.jpg) And representing the covering of women’s bodies as a trait of Islam rather than a cultural norm is pretty misleading. Especially since it dates back to neolithic Mesopotamia and most likely originated as a way for patriarchs to control the reproduction of their families in a totally not sexist way. And this was never a trait of any other cultures [right](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Emmy_Destinn_3.png/640px-Emmy_Destinn_3.png)?\n\nI wonder how the spread of Islam will be represented?\n&gt;“In  the  centuries  after  Muhammad’s  death, Muslims  spread  their  religion  by  conquest.  Islamic  rulers  took  control  of  Southwest  Asia,  Central Asia,  North  Africa,  and  parts  of  India  and Spain.\n\nOh, okay. They are just critical of the empire and expansion. Islam just happens to be the religion of these states. I'm sure that Christianity will get the same treatment when its covered.\n\n&gt;“When  Europeans  arrived,  they  brought Christianity  with  them  and  spread  it among  the  indigenous  people.  Over  time,  Christianity  became the  main  religion  in  Latin  Americans.\"\n\n*vomits on computer*\n\n&gt;“Priests  came  to  Mexico  to  convert  Native Americans  to  the  Roman  Catholic  religion.  The Church  became  an  important  part  of  life  in  the new  colony.  Churches  were  built  in  the  centers  of towns  and  cities,  and  church  officials  became leaders  in  the  colony\"\n\n*still vomiting*\n\n&gt;“The  Spanish  brought  their  language  and Catholic  religion,  both  of  which  dominate  modern  Mexico\"\n\n \n\nIt was so sweet of the ~~conquistadors~~ abrazodors to spread their religion and language peacefully. Its no wonder that the Natives quickly abandoned their paganism when presented with the right religion.\n\n*continued in the comments*\n\n",

The Tet offensive demonstrated that they had no idea what the Vietcong were capable of and while it was a military victory of sorts it also ~~required~~ involved lots and lots of brutally killing civilians on all sides. Secondly, to say that only 'champagne socialists' in universities were responsible for turning America against the war is to ignore the opinions of noted dangerous communists such as [Walter Cronkite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#The_Tet_Offensive) and [Robert McNamara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive#United_States_2). Finally, to suggest that the main reason that America eventually lost was that there weren't enough people to serve as officers is just kind of insane.\n\n&gt;Lenin was sent into Russia by the German's during WWI to destabilise the country. As it was known that the serfs in Russia could be easily convinced and the government lacked clout to stop them.\n\nThis is partially true, in that [Lenin was allowed passage into Russia because Germany recognised that he would destabilise the country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin#Consolidating_power). To say that he was 'sent' implies that he was some kind of German agent, which is... *mildly untrue*. Whether they sent him or just let him go, it was not because they thought 'that the serfs in Russia could be easily convinced and the government lacked clout to stop them' but because there had been an actual revolution in Russia *already* without Lenin's direct intervention and the 'government' of the time, such as it was, was already fairly heavily left-leaning.\n\n&gt;The ANC were marxists\n\nYes, the ANC were Marxists. OP receives 100% for this statement, so let's just... stop... there...\n\n&gt;and due to subversives within the West gained widespread support amongst plebs overseas and at home.\n\nOh, God, why?! Yes, plebs, it wasn't the brutal racism of apartheid that caused people all over the world to oppose it, it was just 'subversives' banging on about Marx. And it was only plebs that fell for this because they can't think for themselves, so all of you out there who think that maybe racism is sort of bad and basing your society on it is kind of evil are actually just plebs who've fallen under the sway of champagne swilling subversive socialist hippies. It's not your fault, don't worry: If you weren't such a pleb you'd be okay but... Well, just don't get ideas above your station, yeah?\n\n&gt;Rhodesia was a multicultural nation with a strong hierarchy. They were overthrown by marxism which promptly destroyed the nation.\n\nI don't know much about Rhodesia, so someone else can step in here. I suspect that being a British colony wasn't all that rosy for the Rhodesians, though.

        "author": "flyingdragon8",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2fys8g/great_leap_forward_famine_dont_real_demographers/",
        "text": "Post: http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2fwhvf/why_is_the_great_leap_forward_considered_the/ckdxm07\n\nReposted here as hopefully sensible mods over there will delete that garbage post soon\n\n&gt; I'm not a historian but I've looked into this myself.\n\nuh oh\n\n&gt; The issue is that the Great Leap Forward is still a massive politically contentious issue and you basically have many sides of the debate ideologically pulling in certain ways to make the famine worse or make the famine better for whatever political or ideological reasons they have. Just a quick example, the death rate of 25.43/1000 I believe is the official death rate of the GLF, but you have anti-Communists say this is too low and the CCP is trying to cover itself, but then you have others that say this figure is inflated in an attempt to discredit Mao Zedong and solidify the factional power of Deng and his successors (which is likely since the GLF was never even officially referred too before Deng so why did they need to cover themselves for something that was successfully suppressed for 20 years?).\n\nAKA herp derp some say this some say that, but *I'm* obviously neutral so trust me.\n\nCouple of things. \"Discredit Mao Zedong and solidify the factional power of Deng and his successors\" was something Deng and his successors explicitly avoided doing and continues to avoid doing. For a very detailed look at Deng's political maneuvers in the mid to late 70's, refer to [Ezra Vogel's excellent book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064EHZY0?btkr=1). Deng survived Mao's purges largely because of his continued apparent loyalty to Mao. Every action he took was designed explicitly to have enough plausible support from Mao. When Deng was recalled from exile to rebuild the country in the late stages of the Cultural Revolution, the phrase he used to describe his policy of pragmatism \"实事求是\" (seek truth from facts) was carefully chosen because it was a quote found from one of Mao's earlier speeches.\n\nAfter Mao's death, the excesses of the Cultural Revolution were blamed on the Gang of Four. Mao himself was never an acceptable target of genuine intra-party criticism after his death, up to the present day. To quote the Global Times (http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/833595.shtml) *We must admit that Deng Xiaoping's remark about Mao's life that he was \"70 percent right and 30 percent wrong\" represents the mainstream ideas about Mao.* To see further examples of this, see Xi Jinping's recent speech commemorating both Deng and Mao together, and the recent CCTV miniseries 历史转折中的邓小平 which also avoids negative depiction of Mao.\n\n\"the GLF was never even officially referred to before Deng\" is an outright and preposterous lie. The main reason Mao was partially sidelined by other members of the party leadership in the early 60's was specifically because of the disaster that was the GLF. The political maneuvering that followed was one of the causes of the Cultural Revolution.\n\n&gt; So anyway, there are two popular ways the Great Leap Forward has been made \"The biggest famine of all time\" even when this is most definitely an ideologically backed statement.\n\n\"Most definitely an ideologically backed statement\" according to who? Even if we accept very low estimates, the GLF is still at least among the worst famines in recorded history if not literally the worst.\n\n&gt; In the first a population pyramid during 1958 to 1961 has been identified as \"famine deaths\". This has a major problem that not only the people who were actually alive and who died in excess of normal numbers are included in the missing millions, but so are all \"hypothetical people\" who were not born at all, but \"should\" or \"could\" have been born if the birth rate had not fallen. This seems to be the definition that Wikipedia cites (and explains death rates into the 20 of millions up too 80 million). This isn't exactly a great definition though since for people to die in a famine, they should probably exist in the first place unless the Chinese have the unique ability to die without being born. If people are told 20-80 million died, then they would be right to assume, 20-80 million people starved to death.\n\nWTF is this mythical falling birth rate you refer to? It is true that the CCP promoted modern family planning and birth control on a large scale, but Mao specifically also endorsed the idea of the \"光荣妈\" (glorious mother) to produce as many children as possible. In fact the 50's were a period of historically high birth rates in China, especially compared to the world war / civil war period that preceded it.\n\n&gt; The second way used by people like Coale, Banister and Dikötter is that they take population totals yielded by the 1953-1964 censuses, but then dispute the official fertility rate even though it was based on a population sample of 30 million people (5% of the population). Instead they project fertility rates from the 1982 census back on the period creating a larger total birth between 1953 and 1964.\n\nEven if we assume that the birth rate in China was zero, the decrease in estimated total population (and therefore decrease in estimated deaths from death rate) would not be severe, certainly not an order of magnitude. This is some idiotic number waving to trick people without basic numeracy.\n\n&gt; So if more people were born over the period of 1953-1964, correspondingly these people must have died in the same period. These authors then arbitrarily allocated the assumed higher numbers of deaths over the individual inter-censal years by assuming varying rates by which deaths were \"under-reported\" during each of these years.\n\nThe under-reporting assumptions were on the order of 10% or so, hardly outlandish. Even assuming no under-reporting there would still be millions of deaths.\n\n&gt; It was now up to the demographer to just \"make up\" whatever death rates they felt like. This is how you get such widely varying death rates for the Great Leap Forward. Coale's death rate is 39/1000, Bannister's death rate is 44.6/1000, Dikötter 27.6/1000. There are no reasonable basis for any of these figures.\n\n\"The range of estimates is wide therefore the true number must be negligibly low.\"\n\n&gt; Not only that, a linear time trend was then fitted by these demographers to deaths derived from a variable, the death rate which always behaves non-linearly and the extent which the death rate was above this declining trend was then used to derive total 'excess deaths'. We know that deaths per population can never reach zero, so fitting linear trends makes zero sense. The linear trend used by Coale, Dikötter and Bannister make the assumption that the Chinese population was on the verge of reaching zero deaths and achieving immortality.\n\nWhat the fucking shit are you even talking about? The death rate as a function of time is not actually a perfect line?? YOU DON'T SAY!! If I fit a line to my time data, it will OBVIOUSLY intersect zero at some point in the future unless my line is just a constant. Maybe you plot your lines on non-Euclidean surfaces? But for the span of 1958-1961, a linear or piecewise linear approximation is perfectly fine. More bullshitting to distract illiterate people.\n\n&gt; Now I'm not as certain how other sources have come too their death rates and I've seen death numbers thrown around as low as 3 million. But generally speaking, this is how the death numbers are come by generally in the west to come to the number that \"Mao Zedong killed 80 million people during the Great Leap Forward\".\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, this is a still a massively political contentious issue till this day and Mao Zedong is one of the most controversial figures of all time so take whatever you read generally with a grain of salt.\n\nI can't deal with this horseshit. Quick look through user's history reveals a goldmine of similar cul-de-sac-internet-marxist type badhistory. If you're a pro-CCP type, there's actually plenty of post-1949 history you can legitimately point to, but defending the Great Leap Forward is probably not the best idea.",

        "text": "Post: http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2fvff0/black_history_month/\n\nNow the picture itself has all kinds of bad, especially bad sociology, but this is bad history, so moving on.\n\n&gt;My white ancestors were enslaved as well.\n\nThe favorite apologetic of white people.\n\nR5 The reason that statement is bad history is because it's very misleading. For one, there's no real clear definition of \"white\" so the statement isn't really falsifiable cause you can argue over if they're white or not. But not only that, it ignores the racial implications behind chattel slavery in the US. Were white people slaves? Well sure, but they weren't slaves *because they were white*\n\nEdit: To clarify R5 a bit more\n\nA favorite thing to be pointed out is the whole slavery aspect throughout the world, but slavery isn't exactly a uniform trade that existed. For instance there was indentured servitude, in which the person was not considered property, and would eventually be freed, chattel slavery, in which the person was considered property, could not own property, and families could be born into slavery, and captured soldiers during wars, which is entirely it's own animal.\n\nHowever, over all, \"white slavery\" undoubtedly would have largely fallen into the categories of \"indentured servitude\" and \"captured soldiers\" and not as much \"chattel slavery\" (I don't wanna say never, especially since I'm not an expert.) \n\nAs well, getting into the later posts I mention, the African tribes warring were capturing prisoners of war, but the slave trade buying them then treated them as chattel (property.) So saying white people were enslaved isn't *wrong* per se, but definitely misleading\n\n&gt;Fun fact: every race has been enslaved  \nMore fun facts: slavery is still alive and well in Africa\n\nAgain, ignoring the racial implication, which gets worse later on\n\n&gt;Another \"fun\" fact: Those Africian [sic] slaves that were sent to the Americas? They were bought from the Africians [sic] who would raid other tribes then sell the people as slaves.\n\nThis is true, but again misleading. They say \"Africans\" as though they're one homogenous group. Now granted, they later mention tribal warfare, which is the key factor, but it still comes off as a major \"Well they did it to themselves\" sort of apologetic. They were warring tribes. America's chattel slavery was distinctly race based\n\n&gt;the black man sold the black man.\n\nSee above\n\n&gt;Korea abolished slavery in 1894 and actually it lasted until 1930s. But no Koreans give shit about that.  \nWhy are black people in the US giving so much shit about slavery?\n\nAgain, ignoring the racial reasons for slavery in the US\n\nBasically, to avoid getting too much into R2, it's mostly a whole bunch of ignoring the context in which slavery existed in America, the implications of it, and the kinds and implications of slavery in other parts of the world.

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PInc7A5iQaQ\n\nI'll take this apart bit-by-bit, paraphrasing the points he makes that include bad history (virtually all of them), as it isn't an interesting video and he's rather unpleasant to listen to. (In fairness, I'd say the whole genre of people ranting to their webcams and uploading to youtube is unpleasant to view, though I guess that's just personal opinion.)\n\nAnyway, this comes to us from [this old thread,](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1r9e2c/thomas_dilorenzo_applies_his_academic_rigor_to/cdkygua) in which I gave a basic overview of one of Thomas DiLorenzo's works.\n\n00:15:\n\n&gt;True or not: did the government end slavery?\n\nYes, by ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment if we confine the question to the United States. That's the definitive answer to the question. But apparently this guy has his doubts.\n\n00:30:\n\n&gt;Confining answer to the United States, so it's not applicable to the rest of the world necessarily.\n\nGood, so my answer above remains valid and correct.\n\n00:40:\n\n&gt;Important to remember that the history of slavery is not confined to chattel slavery in the U.S.\n\nTrue, though I'm genuinely confused every time someone mentions this and expects it to be taken as compelling or profound. Obviously this is true, and I've never once heard a single person claim that slavery was a uniquely U.S. phenomenon.\n\n00:55:\n\n&gt;Interesting that in our language, 'slavery' means something narrow and specific...and I'm addressing its use in that context\n\nAgain, I assume he means that 'slavery' typically refers to U.S. slavery in popular usage. I'm not so sure that's true, as virtually everyone knows what it means and that it isn't a uniquely U.S. historical phenomenon.\n\n01:05:\n\n&gt;You can answer the question *yes* or *no*, and either one has qualifications\n\nK, I'll give him that. But the ultimate answer is yes. The government ended slavery with the ratification and enforcement of the Thirteenth Amendment, the language of which giving Congress and by extension the military the power to enforce abolition. It simply would not have ended in practice without the enforcement clause.\n\n01:35:\n\n&gt;If the conclusion is *yes*, the qualification is that it was less intentional or indirectly true, and a post hoc justification for something [ACW] that had already happened.\n\nThere's a kernel of truth to this, in that if we take Lincoln as the sole voice behind the decision to emancipate the slaves when they were (which we mustn't do), you can argue that Lincoln viewed abolition as in a sense redemption for the blood of the conflict, and failure to emancipate an indication that the war itself had been in vain. So much is in the language of his Second Inaugural Address (\"...and if God wills that [the war] continue until all the work piled by the bondsman's two hundred years of unrequited toil shall be sunk\") and in other places. But you still have to consider Lincoln's history of being anti-slavery in spite of only becoming an abolitionist during the war, the fact that Lincoln viewed the war itself as God's punishment for the wickedness of American slavery, that by this point abolition was a condition of reunification as it had essentially been since the beginning of 1863 and through the election of 1864, and that none of the above refutes the fact that government action ended slavery both by law and enforcement. The notion that there's merit to both sides, so far, seems to imply an unwillingness to concede this point due to ideology than fair analysis of the evidence. Yet, who but Volcano knows.\n\n01:55:\n\n&gt;If no, all [the American people] had to do was not enforce [slavery]\n\nAlso true, as slavery was in part made viable by government enforcement in the sense that, for example, property rights essentially require that sort of enforcement due to the fact that they're humans and capable of escape to states where slavery wasn't in practice. Of course, there are counterexamples here, such as the fact that eradication of the slave trade (which had formerly required naval protection) now required government enforcement of its abolition. But still, the government outlawed slavery in 1865. The nuance doesn't refute the main point, it only adds a dimension. This guy continues to argue just past the 02:00 mark that abolition came about through a lack of enforcement, which is, again, blatantly false on the whole. Southern plantation owners were bent on keeping their slaves, and lack of enforcement on the part of the federal government just meant secession and further use of the confederacy's government for stricter enforcement, which was eventually invalidated as a possibility by the Union suppressing the rebellion and enforcing its new amendment in the seceded territories.\n\n02:20:\n\n&gt;What *is* untrue is that the federal government launched a moral crusade to end slavery\n\nNot true at the beginning of the war, though it was clear that emancipation required gov't enforcement either at the state or federal level, and it is true that abolitionists and anti-slavery advocates largely held moral convictions against slavery. If we extend the argument into the war itself, then the cause for abolition (which had gained a lot of ground) either becomes a moral crusade or a measure to end the rebellion. Or both. So yes, there's some nuance here, but to state that it's entirely untrue is in error if you consider that abolition, which overwhelmingly played into the cause of the war, was born of moral concerns by and large. This dates back to the Quakers, Franklin's abolition society, and so on.\n\n02:45:\n\n&gt;The only reason the gov't did continue enforcing slavery was in the context of the rebellion\n\nI guess that's true, but at the same time the rebellion was caused by increasing fear of abolition as well as anti-slavery agitation in the North both on the part of individuals acting independently of government (i.e. Brown) and the radical anti-slavery federal appointees in Southern offices that the Southern politicians feared the president-elect was going to make (largely due to paranoia than any such threat).\n\n03:00:\n\n&gt;Slavery in the north, by which I mean Union states, was still legal\n\nSure, but these were Southern states that stayed neutral or loyal to the Union. They tend to be more identified with the North now, but do fit into several historical and some current definitions of 'the South'. The North-South divide is imperfect in the way it's used to refer to the Civil War, as people tend to forget that 'Southern' states stayed in the Union, and that many Southerners did in fact oppose secession and stayed loyal (or attempted to stay loyal) to the Union.\n\n03:20:\n\n&gt;The North remained complicit in slavery, such as by allowing Southerners to bring their slaves into the North and perform work without having to free them in accordance with state laws\n\nTrue, but largely because fucking Southerners wouldn't have it any other way, and Chief Justice Taney's decision in *Dred Scott* was in part made out of concern for Southerners breaking apart from the Union if they felt their property rights were slightly threatened.\n\n04:45:\n\n&gt;Lincoln defended a slaveowner in court\n\nLincoln did do this, but a lawyer's arguments in court don't have to align with their personal convictions, so I'm not sure exactly what the point of this is.\n\nWhoops, sort of drifted off for a few minutes but I don't believe there was much substance here. If I missed something, be sure to point it out.\n\n09:30:\n\n&gt;Lincoln did not want to see slavery end right away\n\nThat's incorrect, though one must clarify that Lincoln did not believe slavery *could* end right away due to federal protections of slavery and, among other things, popularity of abolition and concern for the black population (both on their behalf in private, but also a publicly expressed belief in the superiority of whites and the concerns that seemed inevitable for a racially mixed society absent slavery). By his own public confession, however, Lincoln firmly believed in abolition, but not in its feasibility where slavery already existed. And, of course, he uncompromisingly disfavored the expansion of slavery.\n\n10:30:\n\n&gt;Lincoln favored gradual, compensatory emancipation\n\nThis is of course intended as a criticism of Lincoln, but let's keep in mind that this doesn't mean that Lincoln *favored* this as a path by itself, but accepted it as more viable than any other given the fervency of slaveowners and their unwillingness to back any policies that so much as gave a hint of anti-slavery intent. It's pragmatism, though even then Lincoln couldn't even get Delaware slaveowners to pass such a law in their state, so it's not super relevant as a criticism of Lincoln anyway. If you want to criticize anyone here (not sure how helpful that is anyway), then it seems more sensible to go after the slaveowners who were unwilling to use government to reimburse them for slaves, but more than willing to use government to protect slavery. That at least stays consistent with his ideology while not giving a rather silly and misleading account of a historical figure.\n\n11:10:\n\n&gt;To his credit, Lincoln didn't want to murder all of the black people, so he wasn't *quite* the same as Hitler\n\nThat one can just be dismissed outright, as it's an enormously stupid point and moronic hyperbole. There's solid ground on which to question the sincerity of his public statements on white supremacy over blacks alone, and by the end of his life he was very clearly more committed to bringing about legal equality in the form of limited black suffrage and office-holding, being the first president in history to so much as *mention* either of those, let alone support them. His rhetoric throughout his career was moreover peppered with a strong criticism of the hypocrisy in American society that allowed for a devotion to the founding principles in theory, without coming close to actualizing them in reality. Even saying that both Lincoln and Hitler were racist is anachronistic, as we're referring to two different types of racism, Lincoln not so much influenced by the scientific racism that comes about in the latter part of the nineteenth century.\n\n11:20:\n\n&gt;[Lincoln] wanted all of them [black persons] to all go away\n\nI can only take that to mean colonization, but you still have to contextualize this. Colonization certainly had racist motivations in many cases, but many viewed as a lamentable social reality in a society that simply could not come to accept cohabitation without slavery at the foundation of society. Even still, Lincoln begins to abandon this throughout his presidency and in his 1862 annual message to Congress criticized the more sinister justifications for colonization. Some hold that he held onto Colonization until the end of the war, but he did not believe in forced relocation and did not remain a strong proponent as it became increasingly clear that a postwar social revolution was indeed a feasible idea upon Union victory, though the Radical Republicans certainly held much more ambitions plans for that than Lincoln did.\n\n11:35:\n\n&gt;Lincoln was very cautious in his politics, remained on the fence, and swayed whichever way public opinion wanted him to go\n\nThis certainly isn't strongly evidenced by his early presidency, and particularly with his commitment to emancipation in spite of the strong urging against it by members of his cabinet and by others. I think the whole thing's a pretty bad mischaracterization of Lincoln except the portrayal of him as a cautious politician. The better analysis usually tends to emphasize just how opportunistic he could be at times, as well as stubborn with strong tendencies to calculate his actions in accordance with a greater design that he often kept people in the dark about. There's a legitimate criticism of lionization of Lincoln in popular history, such as in Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, but this is a bad way to go about it. The guy certainly wasn't a capricious, timid, spineless politician like the libertarian factions often make him out to be.\n\nAll this qualifies this video for our sub about a dozen times over, but I'm getting extremely bored by this video. I might return to this later on.",

        "text": "So, the Daily Mail exclusively announced, yesterday, that [Aaron Kosminski was the Whitechapel killer known as Jack the Ripper](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2746321/Jack-Ripper-unmasked-How-amateur-sleuth-used-DNA-breakthrough-identify-Britains-notorious-criminal-126-years-string-terrible-murders.html). [Another Mail article here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2747142/Did-horrors-witnessed-boy-turn-Polish-hairdresser-Jack-Ripper-As-book-says-DNA-evidence-definitively-nailed-Britain-s-infamous-serial-killer.html)\n\nWhen I saw this on facebook I was instantly dubious, given how many times I've seen claims of the Ripper murders being solved before. But they have DNA proof this time, apparently, so it must be true.\n\n&gt; DNA evidence on a shawl found at Ripper murder scene nails killer\n\nis the main claim of the article.\n\nUnfortunately this is /r/badhistory, so you know it's not as simple as that. The claim is that a shawl found at the scene of Catherine Eddowes' murder, stained with her blood (thus linking it to the crime scene) also has a semen stain which has been linked conclusively to Aaron Kosminski, proving that he was the Ripper killer. It's hardly the conclusive evidence that the DM paints it as, though.\n\nKosminski was a Polish immigrant. At risk of having this paragraph censored for R2, given the DM's views on Poles, this made me suspicious, though it doesn't actually mean that the story is wrong. Just that I was inclined to view it even more skeptically than I would otherwise view a Mail story (which is pretty damn skeptically).\n\nThe murders stopped in 1888. Kosminski was active around London until he was put in an asylum in 1891. It is not like serial killers to stop killing for no good reason (and fear of getting caught typically isn't enough, especially given that the guy in the article's initial hypothesis was that the shawl was meant to be a clue to taunt police with). Is the reason that Kosminski would have stopped adequately explained? No.\n\n&gt;  September 29 was the night on which Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were killed, and November 8 was the night of the final, most horrific of the murders, that of Mary Jane Kelly. \n\nThis is interesting, considering that Catherine Eddowes was released from a police cell for drunkenness at ~0100 on the morning of September 30th, and the coroner's report concluded that Mary Jane Kelly had died after 0200 on the morning of the 9th. An armchair historian getting the dates of the two murders he was interested in wrong in a way which makes them fit better with his theory doesn't exactly give me confidence in this hypothesis.\n\n&gt; What is certain is he was seriously mentally ill, probably a paranoid schizophrenic who suffered auditory hallucinations and described as a misogynist prone to ‘self-abuse’ – a euphemism for masturbation. \n\nI'm not certain what Kosminski's masturbatory habits have to do with his chances of having commited multiple murder, but I'm not a Ripperologist, so...\n\n&gt;  He told me the police had always believed they knew the identity of the Ripper. Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, the officer in charge of the investigation, had named him in his notes: Aaron Kosminski...\n\n&gt; ...McCormack said police did not have enough evidence to convict Kosminski, despite identification by a witness\n\nWell, the notes mentioned 'Kosminski', first name not given. He wasn't identified as 'Aaron Kosminski' for about a century. Other details don't entirely line up with what is known of Aaron Kosminski -- the same notes claim that the suspect died shortly after being committed to the asylum, but Aaron Kosminski survived until 1919. Again, this says more about our Ripperologist's intellectual dishonesty (or capacity for deluding himself?) than it does about proving that Kosminski was guilty.\n\nAs for the identification by a witness, this is controversial among those who study the killings, and the investigator who writes that Kosminski is a suspect claims that \"no one ever saw the Whitechapel murderer\".\n\n&gt; Using an infrared camera, he was able to tell me the dark stains were not just blood, but consistent with arterial blood spatter caused by slashing – exactly the grim death Catherine Eddowes had met.\n\nDr Louhelainen, who this refers to, is meant to be an expert on DNA identification from historical evidence, not a blood spatter analyst. I have no idea how reliable his identification of this is. Nonetheless, assume that this is the case for the moment.\n\n&gt; But the next revelation was the most heart-stopping. Under UV photography, a set of fluorescent stains showed up which Jari said had the characteristics of semen. I’d never expected to find evidence of the Ripper himself\n\nThis was found on a prostitute's shawl, remember. It *could* be the Ripper, sure, but assuming that it definitely was strikes me as dangerous, when it comes from an item of clothing possessed by someone who came into contact with different men's semen on a daily basis.\n\n&gt; Jari managed to get six complete DNA profiles from the shawl, and when he tested them against Karen’s they were a perfect match.\n\nI don't know enough about mitochondrial DNA profiling, but I wonder how they managed to exclude this woman's other female ancestors? As a historian, the circumstantial evidence is fairly convincing that the shawl was in fact at the crime scene, but I wonder how well that would hold up in court.\n\nThe semen matches Kosminski's DNA profile, but there's no discussion as to whether it could have got there as a client rather than a killer. Nor is there any discussion as to whether there's any other DNA evidence from anyone else on the shawl.\n\nNote that there is no paper published on this yet, and it hasn't been peer reviewed, so no one can actually read about the methodology for themselves, even if they wanted to. There is, however, this:\n\n&gt; Naming Jack The Ripper,  by Russell Edwards, will be  published by Sidgwick &amp; Jackson on September 9, priced £16.99.\n\nWell, the market in having 'conclusively solved' historical mysteries is all alive and well. Personally, I'm not yet entirely convinced...\n\n(Note that because I'm not a historian of the Ripper, or the period, most of my information about the Ripper killings comes from wikipedia. Make of that what you will...)\n\n[EDIT]: I don't know much about evidence handling procedures in the 1890s, but the claimed provenance of the shawl seems really odd to me -- they found it on the crime scene and just let one of the policeman take it away to give to his wife as a present? How likely is that?\n\n[EDIT 2]: The possessions of Eddowes at the time of the murder [mentioned here](http://www.casebook.org/victims/eddowes.html) don't mention anything which could be the shawl, though I can't find a link to the police report that they presumably get this inventory from...",

        "text": "So right now on /r/AskReddit, there's a thread that's asks:\n\n&gt; Historians of Reddit, What are some of the freakiest coincidences of history?\n\n[And of course, as if on cue, the sandwich story shows up.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2fqiiv/-/ckbwq8o) [Twice.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2fqiiv/-/ckbxonu)\n\n&gt; The Assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Archduke and heir to the throne Franz Ferdinand by Gavrili Princep is one of histories biggest coincidences. The Archduke and his wife were in Sarejevo on the same day as the anniversary of a particularly hurtful defeat of the Serbs, so already there was palpable tension in the air. The assassins, including Princep, lined themselves along the main road waiting for their chance while the Archduke's motorcade went along towards the town hall. The first two assassins either lost their nerve or there were too many Serbs nearby so they didn't go for it, but a third one did but the bomb he threw didn't go off until the next car after the Archduke's car passed over it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the Archduke speeds to the city hall, listens to a speech in his honor with irritation then goes to a city magistrates house to complain about what had been done. After this, the Archduke and his wife decide to go visit the innocent bystanders hurt in the attack and go off in their car once more with some extra security too. At this point, neither Princep nor the other assassins knew where the Archduke was. Princep went into a restaurant to sulk and have a bite to eat when the coincidence itself happened. The Archduke's driver turned down the wrong street and realizing the mistake immediately went to reverse, but the car stalled. And guess where the car was? Yup right outside the restaurant where Princep was. Princep saw the Archduke's car, took his pistol and walked out of the restaurant and proceeded to shoot both the Archduke and his wife.\n\n-\n\n&gt; In mid-1914, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, his wife and the obligatory group of less important political figures and other random hangers-on that always accompanies a soon-to-be-assassinated fool, were cruising through the streets of Sarajevo in a (stupidly) open-top car.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was this guy named Gavrilo Princip. He was a Bosnian student and guerrilla, part of a group called the Black Hand. The Black Hand had crafted an intricate assassination plot, which basically consisted of, \"just kill this dumbass somehow.\" Unfortunately, as is always true with intricate assassination plots, something went wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Franz's motorcade passed by the assassins, one of the group, a guy named Nedeljko Cabrinovic, lobbed a grenade at the motorcade. The problem was he was using a shitty 1914 grenade, so it took 10 seconds to detonate, and by then Uncle Franz was out of range. The unlucky fools in the car behind them bit it instead and the grenade injured 20 people who were taken to a nearby hospital, and the assassins dispersed in the chaos.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cabrinovic took a cyanide pill that failed to kill him and jumped into a three foot river to \"drown\" himself. Franz and his party, it seemed, were safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Franz was not yet done putting his life in insane danger. Against the advice of pretty much everyone, he insisted on going to the hospital to visit the people who were injured by the grenade. The driver, unfortunately, had no idea where the fuck he was going. They ended up crisscrossing hilariously through the streets of Sarajevo, until they just randomly happened to pass a cafe where, you guessed it, Gavrilo Princip was enjoying a post-failed-assassination sandwich.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the obligatory pause of dumbfounded luck, Princip grabbed his pistol and turned the tide of history. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the cause of WWI which was the cause of WWII which together have changed and shaped the face of the modern world. All because a Bosnian guy went for a sandwich and a monarch got lost on the same street.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it wasn't for this insane coincidence most of us would not be alive today.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Taken from a Cracked article by Fernando Espino. Altered for comprehension.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cracked.com/article_17298_6-random-coincidences-that-created-modern-world.html\n\nThe second post even cites Cracked, for Volcano's sake. \n\nUnfortunately for them, someone at the Smithsonian already [debunked the sandwich story for us](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/?no-ist). Let me quote:\n\n&gt; That’s not because the modern version isn’t broadly faithful to the facts; it’s not even utterly implausible that Princip might have stopped off at Schiller’s for a bite to eat. No, the problem is that the story is suspiciously neat–and that the sandwich is a quintessentially Anglo-American convenience food. The dish was named in the 1760s for John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was in the habit of requesting his meat placed between two slices of toast so he could lunch at his desk. But it took time for the idea to cross the Channel, and I find it hard to believe the sandwich would have featured on a Bosnian menu as early as 1914.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Joachim Remak, writing in 1959, says the assassin waited outside Schiller’s, where he spoke to a friend, but makes no mention of him lunching there. Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, writing nine years later, makes the separate point that Schiller’s delicatessen stood on the original route planned for Franz Ferdinand’s motorcade; indeed, the chauffeur’s fatal uncertainty was caused by the local governor, Oskar Potiorek, shouting at him from the passenger seat that he had should have stayed on Appel Quay. In other words, Princip was standing in precisely the right place to assassinate the archduke if the Franz Ferdinand had stuck to his plans, and so could hardly be said to be the beneficiary of some outlandish coincidence. And David James Smith, author of One Morning in Sarajevo, June 28 1914 (2008), the most recent book-length study of the assassination, notes that the murder took place at around 10.55 a.m.—rather early for lunch. Not one of these authors mentions Princip eating; none even seems to be aware of the version of the story being taught today.\n\nI do highly recommend reading the rest of the article, it's pretty good.\n\nAnyways, the short of it is that\n\n1. Sandwiches were a sort of a Anglo-American food, and even today eating sandwiches isn't really part of Serbian custom,\n2. Witnesses and other writers noted that the assassination was at 10:55 am, that Princip was in the right place if the Archduke stuck to his plans, and that the deli was actually on the original route.\n3. Princip said he was there during his trial, but he never mentioned eating a sandwich.\n4. The first mention of this sandwich story? The earliest possible source of it was a fictional book from 2001. Otherwise, the story comes from a documentary called *Days That Shook the World* from 2003, and the primary researcher doesn't even remember where the sandwich thing comes from.\n\nGod damn it /r/AskReddit. \n\nEdit: messed up one link, shortened one quote.",

The comment section of Chait's article, however, is a cesspool filled with bad history and slavery apologia, including [this gem](http://i.imgur.com/uH1s0fS.png). I'll go through it bit by bit.\n\n| white people did not go and \"capture\" slaves. Africans were captured and sold by fellow Africans and also Muslims.\n\nWhile the commenter is somewhat correct in that slaves in the Atlantic slave trade were first captured by other Africans and sold to European slave traders, the demand for slaves was fueled by [labor shortages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Labour_and_slavery) in European enterprises in the New World, so that Europeans bear the vast majority of the responsibility for the transatlantic slave trade. Moreover, whites have captured slaves themselves in the Americas, either by recapturing escaped slaves, or by kidnapping free blacks and selling them into slavery, such as the case of [Solomon Northup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup).\n\n| Also, torture, rape, and murder were rare cases.\n\n[Around 2.2 million Africans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Atlantic_shipment) died in voyages across the Atlantic because they were packed tightly into unsanitary spaces by slave traders looking to make a profit. I'd call that murder, and it wasn't a rare case. As for torture, [the 1712 South Carolina slave codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#Slave_codes) contained provisions where slaves attempting to leave the colony would receive the death penalty, slaves who evaded capture for a length of time were to be whipped, branded, mutilated, or castrated, and slaves who were caught with weapons or stolen goods were to be mutilated or executed. Other southern colonies adopted similar codes. It's hard to argue that horrific punishments on slaves, aka torture, were rare cases when they're written right into the legal code.\n\n[Nor was it all that uncommon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#Rape_and_sexual_abuse) for men to rape female slaves they owned. English common law held that children would inherit their status from their father, but in 1662 [Virginia (and other colonies after it) passed a law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partus_sequitur_ventrem#History) that explicitly changed it so that children inherit their slave/free status from their mother. The law would not have been necessary unless slave women bearing the children of free men was a common occurrence at the time. For further evidence, [the 1860 census found 411,000 mix-race slaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States#Mixed-race_children) in the United States. Since black men, especially slaves, weren't permitted to have sex with white women, the vast majority of those mix-race slaves had to have come from white men having sex with female slaves, the power differential of which makes it impossible to have a consensual relationship. That's rape.\n\n| Other ethnic groups, such as Asians and Irish, were subjected to much worse working conditions.\n\nAnd here we have the \"Other people had it much worse!\" card. The obvious retort is: \"So what?\" Even if you can find an example of another group who suffered worse, why does that somehow negate the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade? By that logic, I shouldn't complain about getting robbed because someone else somewhere is getting murdered. That's just stupid.\n\n| This is not meant to excuse slavery\n\nBy the sound of it, that's exactly what the commenter meant to do.\n\n---\n\nI apologize if this goes against the moratorium, but I interpret \"chattel slavery comparisons\" to refer to hyperbolic claims that X event is the same as chattel slavery, rather than badhistory about actual chattel slavery. It's rather vague. If I'm wrong about that, remove this and I'll repost in the moratorium thread or something.\n\nP.S. It would be nice if you included a short explanation of moratorium topics so we know exactly what we can or cannot post about.\n",

        "text": "**COLONIAL PERIOD BAD HISTORY IS BACK!**\n\nTo celebrate Netflix finally streaming this film I present the following /r/badhistory movie review of *1492: Conquest of Paradise* (1992). As is my movie review tradition, a few caveats before we begin. First, I’m not primarily a Columbus or Taino scholar. There are reams of published material on this topic. If I missed something please identify any mistakes so I can learn from my errors. Second, for my sanity and time constraints, I aim for ~2,000 words with these posts. *1492* was so frustrating on a variety of levels that I only made it through an hour of the film. Therefore, this is not an exhaustive review of the movie or the history of the period. Please add more information and discuss further. I may come back and dive into the rest of the film later. Here we go…\n\n**Are you not entertained?!** \n\nTo begin, hoping for historical authenticity in a Ridley Scott film is a bit like cheering for my beloved Vanderbilt Commodores football team: all cautious optimism is immediately crushed by complete incompetence shortly after kickoff. This trend is not limited to *1492*. Check out /u/smileyman’s [Twenty Errors in *Kingdom of Heaven* in 4 Minutes](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1p52zv/twenty_errors_in_kingdom_of_heaven_in_4_minutes/) for a previous examination of Scott’s 100% accurate, documentary quality film, about the Crusades. Thankfully, what works for Vanderbilt football also works for bad history. If you guessed whiskey take a shot. \n\nFirst, the subtitle “Conquest of Paradise”. The New World was no Eden. Though pre-Columbian population estimates are fraught with error, I feel safe in saying that in 1492 the Americas were inhabited by more than a pair of naked humans and a trouble-making snake. The emphasis on Native American innocence and helplessness in contact-period films is patronizing, and not only obscures the complexity of their relationships with *conquistadores* but minimizes their power in dictating how “conquest” would unfold. I’ll avoid a rant on rebellion, resistance, accommodation and the myth of completion in conquest narratives here. Maybe next time. \n\nOpening Credits with epic music and images from the conquest, which start out all happy then transition to images of violence (FORESHADOWING, GET IT?!), then the following text…\n\n&gt; 500 years ago, Spain was a nation gripped with fear and superstition, ruled by the crown and a ruthless inquisition that persecuted men for daring to dream. One man challenged this power. Driven by his sense of destiny, he crossed the sea of darkness in search of honor, gold, and the greater glory of God.\n\nWe’ll pause here. In 1492 Spain and Spaniards were not a monolithic, unified people and did not compose a single nation. Realms vied with one another for power, and though the 1469 marriage of Isabel of Castile to Fernando of Aragon united two of the strongest kingdoms, greater political and cultural homogeneity was centuries away. In addition to Columbus’s voyage, 1492 also saw the finalization of the *Reconquista* to regain control of the Iberian Peninsula (shown in the film with the Fall of Granada). Part of the King and Queen’s attempt to ensure Catholic orthodoxy involved the 1478 establishment of the Spanish Inquisition followed by an expulsion order for Jews and Muslims still living in Spain in 1492 and 1501. We can debate the true motivations, but the Inquisition wasn’t established to persecute bravetheists for daring to dream outside the box, but rather in the initial stages sought to find and punish lapsing Catholic *convertos*.\n\nContinuing on, Columbus wasn’t a bravetheist who alone sought to challenge the power of Castile, Aragon, the Inquisition, and other forms of hegemonic control trying to keep a precious snowflake from achieving his destiny. Though in his own writings Columbus expresses feeling like an outsider, he was not the only person seeking to expand the reaches of the known world in the interest of honor, **GOLD**, and the glory of God. The fascination with gold and silver was not because Spaniards, like cats and toddlers, enjoy shiny things. Gold and silver were non-perishable and represented two of the few items that, pound for pound, were worth the expense of trekking around the world.\n\nThe late 1400s saw a period of immense Portuguese sea exploration and expansion into the Atlantic. Flores, Corvo, the Cape Verde Islands, the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, the Madeiras and the Canaries were all reached, settled, and in some cases home to prosperous sugar plantations by 1478. We all know the tendency to reduce complex history into simple “great men” narratives. Restall, in his book *Seven Myths of Spanish Conquest* states\n\n&gt; in its absolute form the “great men” approach ignores the roles played by larger processes of social change. It fails to recognize the significance of context and the degree to which the great men are obliged to react to- rather than fashion- events, forces, and the many other human beings around them.\n\nThe Columbus myth can be contextualized by two distinct historical processes: (1) the fifteenth-century Portuguese expansion into the Atlantic, and (2) the nineteenth-century process of mythologizing Columbus in the English-speaking world. As shown earlier, in the context of Portuguese exploration at the time, venturing further into the Atlantic was the next logical step. Put bluntly, “had Columbus not reached the Americas, any one of numerous other navigators would have done so within a decade,” as evidenced by Cabral exploring the Brazilian coast in 1500 and Ojeda and Vespucci following the Venezuelan coast in 1499. The second portion of the myth, the growth of popularity in the English-speaking world, started shortly after the U.S. Revolution and the tricentennial of his landing in 1792. Historians like Washington Irving so popularized the Columbus legend that the 1892 celebrations cemented the image of the great man. In 1912 Columbus Day became an official U.S. holiday. \n\n*1492* will latch on the myth of Columbus’s exceptionalism, insight, and destiny. To emphasize his greatness, just in case the opening text failed to sway you, throughout the film Columbus is constantly shown in light, while most other Europeans are shown in dark interiors, or at night (SYMBOLISM, GET IT?!). We are treated to scenes of Columbus bravely engaged in intellectual combat with religious leaders in the midst of an Inquisition (at one point equating himself with Jesus), teaching his fellow shipmates how to navigate with a magic quadrant, and Columbus taking a relatively benevolent (and historically false) response to the lack of Indian tribute. Hogwash.\n\nAlso, what the hell is with the vast array of accents in this film? Depardieu gets a pass, he is French and is basically not even trying, but seriously why does everyone else bother with faking Spanish-y accent? No comprendo.\n\n3:26-5:00 Columbus and his son sit on the shore, very reminiscent of [Obregon’s 1856 painting](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Inspiracion_de_Cristobal_Colon_by_Jose_Maria_Obregon,_1856.jpg). As a ship slowly disappears over the horizon, Columbus peels an orange (FORESHADOWING SPHERES, GET IT?!). “What does that tell you?” he asks his son. His son looks dumbfounded. “The world. Its round,” Columbus responds. “No shit, dad, everyone kinda agrees on that point.”\n\n7:46 The movie’s impetus for Columbus’s voyage (as if destiny wasn’t enough): Turks have closed the overland trade route to Asia and it is too inconvenient to sail east around Africa. Columbus can open trade with Asia by heading west, fulfill his destiny, and show his genius. Why would the Turks close off trade? They profited by serving as middlemen. Makes no sense.\n\nMaybe now is the best time to assault another myth of Columbus and his fellow adventurers. Conquest was propagated by opportunistic, back-stabbing *conquistadores* who wanted to make money in the easiest way possible. See. Was it really that hard to say? No need to make them starry-eyed heroes. Restall describes the typical *conquistador* (not that there was such a thing) as\n\n&gt; a young man in his late twenties, semiliterate, from southwestern Spain, trained in a particular trade or profession, seeking opportunity through patronage networks based on family and home-town ties. Armed as well as he could afford, and with some experience already of exploration and conquest in the America, he would be ready to invest what he had and risk his life if absolutely necessary in order to be a member of the first company to conquer somewhere wealthy and well-populated.\n\nFor some reason contact-period epics don’t want to show Hernando de Soto as a 16th century Jordan Belfort, with slightly fewer Quaaludes, but roughly the same number of STDs, rampaging through the Southeast in search of something of value that will make the trip worthwhile. I would watch the hell out of that. \n\n10:30 Just to prove the Spanish Inquisition situation is serious, we’ll burn some heretics.\n\n13:32 The “debate” at Salamanca occurred in 1486 or 1487. The issue was not the shape of the earth (Spoiler Alert: The earth is round), but rather the size of the sphere. Columbus wrongly argued for a smaller circumference, and was lucky he ran into a New World, while the men at Salamanca were right (about the size of the earth), but were wrong about Columbus and crew dying on a vast ocean separating Europe from Asia. I don’t understand why the movie harps on the whole earth is round debate while the dialogue underscores a spherical earth was common knowledge. In Salamanca Mr. In-Control-with-an-Awesome-Beard states the circumference of the Earth at 22,000 leagues (IMPLYING HE KNOWS IT IS A SPHERE!).\n\n26:00 Now introducing Queen Isabel played by Sigourney Weaver. Of course, Columbus is hitting on her. I like to believe Ms. Weaver exists in some other visually striking [*The Fountain*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414993/?ref_=nv_sr_1)-like alternative universe. You know, Queen of Castile in one scene, Ripley assaulting Xenomorphs in another. Anything to get me through this frickin movie.\n\n33:00 Port of Palos. April 3, 1492. The expedition sets off. Columbus writes that the journey was uneventful, aside from a faulty rudder on the *Pinta* which was fixed during a brief stay in Grand Canary. Funny, you think of Spain as the last European contact for Columbus and company as they venture into the unknown, not that they made a pit stop in a friendly port along the way. According to Columbus, crew complaints about the length of the voyage began near the beginning of October, but promises of generous rewards were sufficient to re-motivate them.\n\n52:54 Columbus the first ashore on Guanahani Island October 12, 1492, followed quickly by the official claiming and naming of San Salvador. What was at stake here? For Columbus the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Viceroy and Governor of all new lands claimed for Spain, and 10% of all revenues from the new lands in perpetuity. Too bad he will spend most of the 1490s lying to the queen that he found a route to the Indies. [It’s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off for him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ru8DMW-grY). My guess is it will come back to bite him in the ass.\n\n58:28 First contact and the introduction of the Lucayan Taino. The Taino were an Arawak group. The Lucayans, part of the Western Taino who inhabited Cuba and the Bahamas, expanded throughout the Bahamas beginning ~700 CE. When Columbus washed ashore a series of chiefdoms held sway over the Caribbean. Class structure divided commoners from nobles, with *caciques* functioning as chiefs with the advisement of priests called *bohiques*. A Caribbean-wide trade network connected the inhabitants of San Salvador, who were a bit on the edge of Taino influence, to the greater region. They relied heavily on marine resources, and were later valued by the Spanish (i.e., abducted and enslaved) as expert pearl/conch shell divers. When we arrive at the Lucayan village the houses in the film are large square/rectangular, elevated on posts, with open sides. In reality [Taino houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno#mediaviewer/File:Reconstruction_of_Taino_village,_Cuba.JPG) were multi-family dwellings, circular, with a thatch cone-shaped top and a central opening to allow for smoke to escape. On Cuba and Hispaniola houses were arranged around a central plaza, whereas Lucayan villages appear to be organized linearly along the coast.\n\nIn the film the Lucayan are showed with shaved foreheads, likely a shout-out to their practice of artificial cranial modification. In his writings Columbus noted multiple scars on the men, a result of fighting the Caribs who were expanding north out of the southern Lesser Antilles and who frequently raided the Taino for captives. I’m having trouble discovering who played the Taino in this film. IMDB lists Costa Rica as a filming location so I assume a Costa Rican tribe stood in for the Lucayan. In the movie the size differential between the tall European and short Native American actors is slightly humorous, given that Columbus’s writings make specific mention of the Tainos being physically tall. Who knows, though, Columbus would, and did, say anything to make himself appear awesome. I’m surprised he didn’t throw a dragon in there for good measure.\n\nRoughly an hour into this film I simply couldn’t take it anymore. Neither whiskey, nor Cherry Coke Zero, nor kitten snuggles could overcome my frustration with the bad history in *1492*, and knowledge of the impending destruction. I may return to discuss the rest of the film in a later post, but for now I am going to leave San Salvador before the story deteriorates into blood and mayhem.\n\nThanks for reading.",
