        "text": "After weeks of not going to the same school at my boyfriend, all my “friends” were never heard from again, i guess my theory about no one caring was true, and my (ex) bestfriend stopped making the effort of hanging out with me. For about the first three months of me moving, I had been crying, breaking down piece by piece about the time I’ve spent at my old highschool. I hated this time because I realized nothing was gonna be the same anymore. Since Holly wasn’t making an effort to call me or text, I stopped too. I was fed up but I still wanted to be friends so I tried talking to Holly again. \n\nMy little sisters birthday was on the way and so I decided to invite my boyfriend and my bestfriend because I missed them both and want to hangout while we celebrated my little sisters birthday. (We were 17 at this time). Everything was going great, my boyfriend was working up the courage to speak to my dad for the first time and Holly was trying to have fun by drinking with my older sisters (25 and up), their friends and my step-brother and his sister. (We’ll call him Rob). \n\nMy sisters weren’t okay with Holly drinking and neither was my mom. Everyone was mad at me for even letting it happen but I didn’t know she was gonna drink. I told her specially not to but what can I do when all she wants to do is party. And she can’t have fun unless she’s getting attention and drinking. She started taking shots with my sisters friends, my stepsister and Rob. She was hammered and my mom was getting worried (oldest) sisters friend was gonna try something with Holly. (Holly had also been following the friend around non stop). Closing to the end of the night, my boyfriend was going to go home because it was late and couldn’t sleepover. Everyone was slowly leaving but my (2nd oldest) sister &amp; her husband, Holly, Rob and my stepsister were all sleeping over at my house. I was sad that my boyfriend went home so I decided to go to sleep. I went to my room, got dressed and was getting ready to lay down when Holly came in and stumbled into my room. She was mumbling and slurring about “how sorry she was for getting drunk and getting me in trouble.” She swore that night “she wasn’t gonna get fucked up like that ever again.” \n\nI had heard all this before and I know it wasn’t true. I told it was okay but she just needed to be careful. “My mom told me she doesn’t want you near (sisters friend).” Holly looked surprised but then reassured me that she was gonna drink lots of water and sleep it off.\n\nMy mother shouldn’t had been so worried about the friend, my step-brother was the problem….\n\nThen she did the unthinkable, she took my face and kissed me. \n\nMy boyfriend hates me and Holly for this but i don’t know what else I could’ve done to prevent it. I didn’t see it coming at all. \n\nI was shocked and frozen but luckily it only lasted for a second. She looked at me scared and said “sorry” then left. \n\nI couldn’t comprehend what happened, so I went to bed. I thought my night couldn’t have gotten any worse. I wake up the next morning, everything is great. By the end of the day everyone left and when on with their lives like normal. \n\n(I never told my boyfriend what happened. Which should’ve been my sign to end my friendship with Holly. SMH!!)\n\nCut to almost a year later, I haven’t talked to Holly in a while. I’m starting not to miss her anymore, she finally got a boyfriend and I’ve been happily enjoying my relationship with my boyfriend. Everything was great until about 4 hours ago. \n\nI’m on a FaceTime with my boyfriend and he suddenly gets all serious. \n\n“I need to tell you something and I need you to promise me, you won’t get mad at me.” Of course no partner of a relationship wants to hear this come out of their loved ones mouth so I start to get worried and my heart starts to beat really really fast. I’m starting to over think all the things Alexander could be telling me right now.\n\nSo he says, “When we celebrated you little sisters birthday last year, Holly and your step-brother had sex in your bathroom while you were sleeping.”  \n\n“Holly made me keep it a secret from you.”\n\n(Imagine how I felt right now, recollecting the whole conversation.) \n\nI was disgusted, embarrassed. I wanted to throw up. I had lost all respect for Holly and Rob, who since we were kids was basically blood to me. We had a bond like no other. \n\nMind you there was a lot of things wrong with those two getting drunk and having sex in my bathroom. \n\nShe was underaged, he was older…\nShe was drunk asf and he was drunk asf…\nShe was flirting with a guy at the time and my brother has a girlfriend and a toddler. \nThey probably didn’t use a condom and she wasn’t on birthcontrol either so he could’ve gotten her pregnant. \nHe pursued her and she instigated it from the beginning of the damn party. \n\nI was betrayed because she didn’t have the dignity to tel me and I was upset with my boyfriend for only now telling me, almost a year later. \n\nI really wanted to throw up. But now I had a bigger issue to think about. I had to tell Alexander about the kiss. \n\nAnd so I did. And he almost broke up with me. Since this just happened not to long ago, I’m not really sure what gonna happened with me and Alexander but I sure as hell am gonna make it up to him since it wasn’t my entire fault. \n\nI blocked her and now I have to figure out away to be petty and end our friendship. Also call out my stepbrother and make him pay the consequences of his actions. \n\nI’m not just pissed at Holly but I’m also pissed at my stepbrother. Holly thought that she could just pretend like everything’s normal but I’m not one to let things slides for long. I realized tonight that she was a terrible friend and that clearly she can’t keep it in her pants. I’m done begging for her forgiveness and for a better friend ship when now I know she didn’t give a shit for a long time.",

        "text": "It all started when I met her( let’s call her Holly for now) in 9th grade, I was a bit more timid than she was. I was the introvert and she was the extrovert. I thought she was my twin,that’s what everyone thought so. (I was always being compared to her, even getting mistaken for her when my back was turned). For years she had always been the center of attention. And I was jealous of her for it. She was bubbly, impulsive, friendly, loud, she knew how to get everyone’s moods up and she always had to party. She met friends everywhere she went and it was overwhelming because when we were in highschool, I was the lost and wounded puppy following her around everywhere. It was hard for me to make friends because I was so shy and I was afraid I would say the most dumbest thing and embarrass myself. It was fun being her friend for a while but sometimes even when we would hangout, I always felt lonely and left out. I didn’t feel like I was apart of the clic, I didn’t feel like anyone cared about me enough to actually want to spend time with me. But when it would just be me and Holly, it felt like we were friends till the end. Everything was going great, Junior year rolled around and I was pretty happy where our friendship was gonna take us. By that time, everything felt good. \n\nUntil Holly started become a little more open to the attention she was getting. \n\nEveryone was gravitated towards her so naturally, she just did was she did best. Made friends with everyone that gave her the time of day. \n\nOne minute she was texting a guy from the northern part of our state, making herself “fall in love” with his personality, and then the next she’d be flirting with another dude from our Algebra 2 class. All at the same time. \n\nI always had seen her go through with this phase of flirting with guys to the point where she’s gonna kiss them or make them get so close to her that they always want something more from her. But she would defuse the situation as if nothing she did was wrong and instigated. \n\nNow I was very supportive of all the shit that she did, it was her business, she could handle it since she put herself in those situations. She was a big girl. But I kept my opinions to myself, didn’t want to break the friendship because I was being to “harsh” or too “realistic”.\n\nSo much so that when I was Introduced to my boyfriend (we’ll call him Alexander) for the first time, she made it seem like she was gonna get the guy again. And also got so close to his bestfriend, she led him on and broke his heart. I was always skeptical of her but it worsened when me, my boyfriend, and Holly would hangout at my house sometimes. They would always talk and laugh so much with each other that I was gonna give up on ever finding love. It felt like I was third wheeling and they were the growing couple. But in the end he chose me, and I was grateful. \n\nI ended up moving in the middle of the school year and I was throughly upset by this decision my parents made. \n\nThis is where I should’ve ended the relationship between me and Holly.",

My relationship with my family, especially with parents has gotten worse over the years and I've been thinking about writing my will for a while and while thinking what to write down I could not bring myself to write anyone down except for my sister(14) turning 15 this year. I have left everything to her, my art supplies, books, clothes, phone, tablet and computer. I even left my cat to her. The only mention of my brothers (24 and 21) and my parents are to allow my sister keep everything in my room or to place everything in a storage unit. And in the case that my sister's dad and step mom do not allow her to have my cat then she will go to my brothers until my sister is of age or until she can support herself and my cat same applies to the storage unit if that's the route my parents take. As for my turtle, I will leave him to my brothers until my sister is old of age or if her dad allows her to keep him. Any and all money which in this moment is not a lot but regardless will be left to my sister as well. And in order to make the will \"legally binding\" I need two adults present and will be asking two of my friends as I know my family would be pissed if they found out they aren't getting anything. I wrote my will about 3 hours before posting this and realized that I have no idea how to tell my sister that everything is in her name, how do I bring this up to her??",

I went all out my entire body was shaved, moisturized, full makeup, blonde wig, painted nails, high heels sexy lingerie.. you get my point. I felt so sexy for my first encounter with a older guy mid 40s jacked with a nice Dick. After we played I felt so fem like a Barbie doll who’s job was to please and look good.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this and it actually hurts to hear her talk about one of my biggest insecurities.

This may or may not have to do with my confession. \n\nBefore you come for me and say I was careless/irresponsible to damage someone elses property and leave, that I’m an asshole, karma will get me, etc… I know and I agree. I accept it.\n\nUnfortunately it is what it is and I can’t go back. Typical story: I’m a younger/newer driver, miscalculated a move, never been in an incident/accident before so honestly didn’t cross my mind in the moment to leave a note + I panicked. Not adding this on to justify anything but for more context… seemed more or less like a beater car, it was cosmetic damage (paint transfer/scratches/scuffs) \n\nDon’t think there were any witnesses, hoping there aren’t cameras (yes, even though it’s a school but they/the city don’t seem to have the funds or care) but I know it’s never too safe to be sure.\n\nHow long until I’m in the clear?!",

        "text": "My grand-mother was very violently abused by my grand-father for decades, and even though I had full knowledge of it and the extent of the violence he inflicted upon her, I didn't say a word to no one. She was severely mentally ill, either schizophrenic or bipolar (remained unclear until she died), and my grand-father hated her for it, he couldn't stand her outbursts of euphoria and despair, and above all, the hallucinations and delusions; she would be shouting at herself trying to cast away the voices that tormented her, and he would make fun of and hit her to have her act \"normal\" in front of whatever guests we had to endure. I knew it all, I saw it all and yet I didn't say a thing to my father, mother or aunt. They knew of the abuse, but they were convinced it was only verbal and that he would not be violent towards her, but he was, and when they asked me if I had seen anything I didn't utter a single word. My grand-mother has died, of suicide, after decades of continuous abuse that got worse with the severity of her illness; the day she died, I was present at her house, and I heard the shouting and the violence and I knew that she would do something irreparable when she entered the bathroom, and yet I didn't intervene, just stood like a dumb child which I no longer was (15 years old at the time of the incident). This is my greatest regret, not having aided the person I loved the most on this earth, the one I resemble the most, and having her die because I was too much of a coward to face my grand-father. \n\nFunny anecdote as a closure, two years after this incident, I would experience my first psychotic break and got diagnosed at 18 with the very same mental illness she suffered from (and my father, so I guess it is genetics playing a trick on me/us).
