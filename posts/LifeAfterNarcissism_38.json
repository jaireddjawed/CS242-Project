I said that I worked pretty hard on my FLEAS (though spelling it out since most people don't know what that means).\n\nThen this I get this comment on my post:\n&gt;Maybe you should also take responsibility and not blame it on someone else. (Meant in a positive and constructive way. You won't get anywhere just saying \"It's someone else's fault I am the way I am\")\n\nI found it very hurtful, because I spent so much time letting go of that time in my life. I was only a child, so I can't really be blamed for much of what happened. It hurts because I know I can easily go back to blaming my abuse on myself. Letting go and putting the fault on my Nmom was one of the hardest thing I did, and I felt like her comment just kicked my legs out from under me.\n\nI actively work on my FLEAs and feel I have very few that aren't just me being human who makes errors. IDK, her comment really got under me. Maybe it also has to do with my attempt at controlling my anxiety with a lower med dose but I just want other people's opinions on it.\n\nEdit: After confronting this person, she apologized. \n&gt;Oh wow, I am EXTREMELY sorry and I took your original comment completely the wrong way. Please forgive me. I thought you were saying your mom was a bit full of herself and passed her habits onto you, not that she was full on abusive. That is in a totally different realm.\nPlease know that I'm just a dumb stranger and you are actually really strong and amazing and that was really not your fault. Wow I am so sorry.\nRevoking my own commenting privileges now.",

I can't figure out why. Which, of course, leads to impatience, disappointment, and frustration from my SO. Which leads to a discussion, which leads to me feeling miserable. I used to just spiral down, go full defensive to him, and berate myself. I don't do that anymore. I try to listen. I acknowledge my fault. I try to be reasonable with myself and talk myself through all the auto-thoughts and emotions that pop up, so that I don't spiral down into depression. \n\nBut that's the only progress I've been able to make, the stuff still doesn't get done. The less I do, the longer the list gets, the more I want to avoid it. I've tried daily tasks. I've tried starting small. I've tried rewarding myself. I've tried a few more things, like books, planners, a big list on the wall, phone reminders, etc. \n\nThe battle that I fight in my head against my old programming is \"It's all too much, just quit.\" So to me, fighting that battle every day, any day I wake up, eat, shower, and get anything done is an accomplishment, relative to what I'm fighting. And it's something that I'm proud of, because I know what I've survived to get here. But it still feels like I have a 3 gallon gas tank and I'm trying to run a Hummer. It's just not enough. I never have enough energy or do enough. Even when I feel good about what I've accomplished, it's not enough, objectively speaking. \n\nIt's just not enough, not for the life I want to have. I want a relationship where my partner feels like we are a team and they can count on me. (He doesn't). I want to be financially stable. (I'm not). I want to perform well at work (I don't). I'm capable of all of this. I know that I am. I am smart, I am caring, and I have the time. I have the ability. So what is wrong with me?\n\nI see that it's me and I just don't know how to change it. I don't even know *why* I can't seem to do things, even when I want to get them done. \n\nI'm so damn frustrated. \n\n",

        "text": "Hey y'all. I come here every so often when I am feeling depressed. Thanks for being here. \n\nI moved out of the nhousehold 18 years ago. Stayed in contact for further gas lighting and abuse for many years. Finally went NC with the majority of my family almost 3 years ago.\n\nI am the SG, with my Nmom, Edad and GC brother. Not to mention all the flying monkeys, of which are plentiful.\n\nMy Nmom has been an embittered, depressed, controlling, spiteful presence in my life for as long as I can remember. I recall being force fed until I vomited. I recall feeling utterly worthless and without a speck of value as a human being. I didn't just feel like that in some fleeting way, it was a simple fact of knowledge that I wasn't worth a cent and my value was based in going along with the adults and keeping my mouth shut. In retrospect, I believe that's why I felt closest to our family dogs - they were always sweet to me, and were treated with equal disdain. I always feel like we were on the same level, we understand each other. \n\nMy grandmother, the most gentle and sweet woman I will be ever know, was HATED by my nmom who blames her for everything. I will never know the truth, whether my Nmom was actually abused now that my grandmother passed away about 2 years ago. My Nmom blamed her for all of her problems in life. \n\nMy grandmother passed during the first year of NC. My Nmom kept texting me afterwards seeing if I wanted anything from my grandmothers property. I ignored these texts and continued with my NC.\n\nPlus I think it goes without saying that if I vocalized to her that I wanted a memento of my grandma's, Nmom would not give it to me without making me feel about as shitty as humanly possible. So I ignored her.\n\nIt was a very painful and difficult time for me. I missed my grandma, the rest of the family were putting immense pressure on me to make contact with Nmom. \n\nBut there is a memento of my grandma's I very much want and would cherish with all my heart.\n\nMy grandmother was a painter, a beautiful artist. She has many of her works hung in her home. She never sold her art - only created for the beauty and joy of doing it. I asked one of my uncles, who I formerly had a good relationship with, if I could please have one of her paintings. I didn't even care which one, anything, big or small would do. He said he would talk to the rest of the family about it. My heart broke, because I know what that means. I am the SG, always was and will remain. I am not in contact, therefore I do not deserve such a beautiful family treasure such as my grandma's art.\n\nI am also a painter, being able to examine my grandma's brush strokes would mean the world to me. \n\nNo one has asked me once what I've been going through. None of them have EVER offered to listen to my narrative. I went nc, and my grandma died, then the cherry on top is my GC brother cut me out of his life after that, won't even tell me why, just quit answering my calls and texts one day and that was it.\n\nLuckily my edad seems to believe me. But not enough to stand up for me to the rest of the family.\n\nI am happily married to a wonderful SO. I have a job I enjoy. I have skills and hobbies I love. I have an awesome big floppy dog who gives me slobbery kisses. I live a couple of thousand miles away from my nfamily.  I am grateful for the feeling of safety and security.\n\nBut truthfully, I never feel safe from the guilt and sadness. It's always there, eager to kick me in my soul and tell me that I don't deserve anything. \n\nI know I'll never have a painting of my grandma's. I need to let it go. But it just breaks my heart.\n\nThanks for reading. My heart goes out to everyone here. (hug)",

        "text": "It's been years since I had contact with my N family members. While I am better now in some ways, my life is still a mess and seems to be spiralling out of control.\n\nI'll try to make this brief. In my case, my parents were the enablers and my mother's sisters were the controlling N monsters. One of them lived in the other half of our duplex with her husband and only daughter. The other would visit us periodically (she lived in Europe). There was always some epic blowout between the two everytime they met, but they both treated me like shit.\n\nIt was all the classic N behavior and my own parents tolerated it and excused it. Intensely controlling environment, and as I grew older my own world became increasingly smaller and if I protested I was made out to be the crazy one. I really didn't feel wanted at all. I didn't have any sort of relationship with my parents at all. I never shared anything because I never felt comfortable doing so.\n\nIt all started coming apart when my mother came down with terminal cancer and eventually passed away. Her sister said that we basically killed her because our caregiving was inadequate. At this point I had to get out and shortly thereafter, and ended up moving 2000 miles away.\n\nI maintained a tenuous connection with my father. He remained in the house and eventually remarried. My mother's sister became an even bigger monster after that. I tried to talk to him about the past and why he allowed all of this to happen to me. In fact, I tried to fix things with everyone multiple times before I left and it never worked.\n\nHe denied, denied, denied. \"It wasn't that bad\", \"I let you do whatever you wanted, so don't blame me if things are bad for you\", etc. I still kept in touch. He visited me once after that. That visit ended with him disapproving of my entire life, telling me I need to come home and get a real life. He then tried to give me money to get me to come back and I declined. The year after that, he called me and said he was going to visit again. I told him not to come, it wasn't a good time. He already bought the tickets and said he was coming anyway \n\nHe actually came to try and see me. At this point, I've had it. I blocked his phone number. I moved to a different house, so he didn't have my new address. He blew up my phone before I finally blocked him, all pissed off. That was my last contact.\n\nI felt better, but my life got worse after that. I had and still have no direction. No goals. I drift from one marginal situation to the next. It's like I'm a caged bird. The cage is finally open but I forgot how to fly.\n\nIt's been years and I'm getting worse. I don't know how to heal and I don't know what to do. I fear I'm permanently damaged and my life is already fucked. I've thought about ending it but I don't have the courage and now I'm stuck...",

I got pregnant over 4 years ago and couldn't wait to tell her. I just knew she'd be so happy for me - for our family - hell, I expected her to love me more. Ironically, a few months after finding out, she cut contact with me entirely and moved across the country. She's had nothing to do with me or my husband/kids ever since then. She continues to reach out to my brother from time to time - always saying she misses him and loves him. \n\nThe more I'm learning about how toxic she is the less I'm angry that she's gone. I'm wondering though if anyone else got \"dumped\" out of their parent's life and if anyone has any insight into this or helpful input? Before she left I would have said she was my best friend ever - toxic or not, being abandoned by her has been, and continues to be, painful. Thanks for listening! ",

        "text": "I was generally deprived of food growing up, but not my Nparents- they would often eat out or bring things home for themselves as they worked, did errands, etc., but we'd have a couple frozen items in the fridge that they wouldn't cook for us (they had to actually be cooked, not microwaved) unless it was absolutely necessary. However, if I went to a birthday party or there was an event in the classroom with food, I went nuts and pounded down enough food until I was physically uncomfortable. Never had lunch money or food to bring to school; in elementary through middle, sometimes kids would take sympathy on me and give me some food/leftovers. In high school I would linger around campus after the initial 20 minutes of lunch time to see if anyone ditched their leftovers.\n\n\nYears later, after having struggled with weight issues, I've come to realize how difficult self-control is for me around food. Some things I've noticed:\n\n\n- I have my leftover food from restaurants boxed always, though part of this I think is also due to some sense of frugality\n- Though not as much now, I get bothered when I see people not take their unfinished meal from restaurants home with them\n- I used to get somewhat emotional when I would see someone throw food away. Not spoiled food, but just, \"Eh, don't want it.\"\n- At this point in time I have to buy single servings of things because if not, I'll scarf down the whole lot in a night/by the next morning. I can't buy a 2qt. container of ice cream, it has to be a single pint. Can't buy a bag of chocolates, has to be a single bar. Even pizza, I'll just go back to it later after the initial sick feeling and have more.\n\n\nDiscussing it with my spouse, he definitely believes it's because I never had certain things as an option growing up so there's an irrational fear of that same thing not being there tomorrow. After having realized and acknowledging these things, I've gotten a slightly better handle on myself, but I still struggle. I don't want to be overweight. Also I know my weight is my responsibility so I'm not placing the entire blame on my Nparents.\n\n\nHow have you managed to better your self-control?",

I'm on my phone rn and it's hard to link :)\n\nI had an interview for another position with the same company- same job (same salary, benefits, scheduled etc) just different population to work with. That was yesterday. I told them straight up about the other position had recommended me for hire and I was just waiting on the official offer. They did the interview anyways. It went well and I got warm fuzzies from the supervisors. \n\nToday I finally got the call I've been waiting months for- I GOT THE OFFICIAL OFFER!\n\nBut here's the kicker- for BOTH POSITIONS! So now I have to choose which one! It's a huge compliment and I am not prepared to make this choice! I think professionally I'm more confident working with kids (position 1- the original one I interviewed for) and everyone seemed nice. Position 2 is adults and I don't feel as confident in my knowledge with that population. The only thing that gives me pause is that I got a really good vibe from the supervisors with job 2. Warm and fuzzy. So I have no idea! I'm leaning towards job one. I have until Monday to decide :)anyways had to share the great news!!",

        "text": "I thought I did have friends who supported me. I don't know.. but I broke contact with those friends, because they knew the me with all the fleas-- plus they have fleas as well. And in my theory, change would be difficult if you stay with the same people who are used to the same habits.  Unless you give me evidence otherwise, I'm still going to believe this theory to be true. Besides that, the friendship felt awkward and one sided. I was the one who pursued them, while they gave not much of an effort. I don't know if it was maybe starting to change or not (honestly, I felt I needed to let go and move on.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, my therapist thinks I should \"think about how being alone affects me.\" Honestly, being alone has been one of the best things and worst things I've ever experienced. I trust this therapist, but not entirely sure.. so I don't exactly relay unconventional thoughts like this freely. I hate having to explain things and not be understood. So often people respond to others so they can be heard, so they can inject their wisdom instead of talking about what's actually being talked about. While I'm aware that's normal.. I don't really care much for it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd honestly, nobody really cares all too much to know what you've been through or survived-- naturally so (of course, unless they're narcs or enablers.) It's rare that someone cares right off the bat. It usually takes time for someone to care. Which, I'm not in a particular hurry to get anyone to care.. I'm not sure if my therapist is trying to say I should be in a hurry to get people to care about me? If my therapist is, I'm really not sure this therapist understands.. Now, I realize I should probably tell this to them.. so I'll probably bring this up on the next appointment. But for right now, I'm not going to lie, it kind of annoys me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI mean-- I already had a \"friend\" who I thought was sort of supportive, but it turns out I created that thought in my head, because equated listening to a friends troubles with support. But apparently it's not, because she decided to ignore me. I want to know why, but I think it's better if I don't ever find out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd I think I'll explain why my therapist suggesting I get out more annoyed me.. I'm not exactly resilient when I get hit by social rejection. It's easier to be alone, and there's a certain freedom to it. It makes me anxious and nervous when I'm told by others it's BAD TO BE ALONE, or that it's SAD TO BE ALONE. OF COURSE I'D ENJOY COMPANY. Who doesn't enjoy laughing with company? That's a great thing. And you know what? I tried that at a support group. I was laughed at when I said there are times in yoga when they say reassuring things that made me feel better. And an old guy trying to get close with me, and telling me I never experienced disassociation. FANTASTIC. WONDERFUL (/sarcasm). So no getting close to people \"like me\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhich leaves, normal people who will ask me questions, and I respond awkwardly that makes them think I want to be left alone-- which is only half correct. It's easier to pretend like you don't want to be friends so you don't get rejected. I also don't know how to display enough enthusiasm without getting nervous and talking my mouth off. Especially when I know most of them won't amount to anything anyway. I won't contact them, they won't contact me. You say \"well, that's life. That's how you make friends.\" Cool! I respect that. But for me, it's very tiring. Maybe it's because I get discouraged easily. IDK. I like to keep the hope alive in myself rather than in relationships. And I have no idea if that'll make sense to my therapist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can't say I'm 100% not trying to make excuses. ",

        "text": "I'm a 26 year old guy, with no relationship experience. I had a fwb for eight months, and have hooked up with a couple of people casually, but I'm tired of casual sex.  \n\nI've worked on myself enough that I'm not attracted to completely unavailable women or Ns. However, I'm still attracted to women that are emotionally unavailable.\n\nThe general problem is that while I crave more of a connection, intimacy terrifies me, so when I find someone I'm romantically interested in, it's two steps forward, one step back (mixed signals are great to give off!) or I find ways to push them away because I'm absolutely terrified of rejection. \n\nThere's a girl that I like, known her for about a month, and I know that we aren't going to date (my mixed signals at the start and fact she's leaving in a month see to that). I'm probably not ready anyway to date because of the intimacy issues, but I wanted to be for her. When I'm around her, I'm finding that I'm revealing things that I'm largely uncomfortable talking about, and it's like they just come out of me - I have no control, like these things have just decided to be spoken to her by my brain. I think that her presence allowed me to do something that I've never been able to do previously, and never thought I could. There's some sort of connection, but it doesn't feel crazy or too intense like infatuation or a crush - just solid and present, like what I have with my best friend, except I'm attracted to her. I think I'm starting to fall for her and it absolutely terrifies me. Anyway, I'm having trouble because of the increasing intimacy/feelings and I realized that I was scared and doing things to try to push her away. We're going to have to work together on a hobby for the next month or so, which means that I can't keep pushing her away, because we work well together. I'm planning on talking with her about it (apologizing for pushing her away and explaining that I'm scared), but I could use ideas on how to not freak out if we continue to get closer.\n\nAlso could use general information about how to get more comfortable with intimacy and vulnerability. \n\nOr just advice that might be helpful.",

Part of it is my current situation so I'm definitely seen as vulnerable.

In my case, I am not a willing victim. The very second I figure out their game, I confront them, then kick them out of my life, every single time. I am not afraid of them and they will be gone ASAP. So I don't get it. There shouldn't be much about me that says, \"I hate myself enough to let you abuse me,\" because nothing is farther from the truth. I HATE Ns, I hate people who think they can take advantage of and abuse others for their own gain, and I let people who try it with me know exactly what I think about it before they never hear from me again.

He was accidentally bailed to my address, where M and I lived.  He was still allowed contact etc.  So he was messaging people on my FB and saying awful things. I posted and said that wasn't me, was [ex] and most people got it and accepted it.  My narcissistic family on the other hand... \n\nMy mother had decided until I went NC last Sept/Oct to use exs name wherever possible and make it about her.  Typical narcissistic bullshit. But through all the strained relationships I thought me and my brother could at least keep occasional civility.  That was until my brothers wife's ex found copies of the ex messages and started sending them out again.  I've explained to my brother it was  not me. He's not accepting that anymore, even though he has for 5 years. I tried arguing that it's 5 years ago. So what the hell does it have to do today??? Nope.

So I am in therapy for three years and extremely LC with nmom and edad. \n\nThe boss in question had once said that he is jealous of me because I have more freedom in my life than him (he has kids, is the sole breadwinner, three jobs.) In the winter he approached me about a new program that we would be rolling out and then told me that he wanted me to help plan it. I was flattered to help and did the research he asked me to do. He said, \"Good job on the research\" and then I never heard another word about it again. I emailed him about a month after sending him the research and then a month after that to offer him assistance. I never got a reply. But this is not unusual because he has so much going on. Now the project that we spoke about is beginning and I have cleared my schedule and not prepared to work other places. He said he would put me on the schedule but has not said anything to me except saying he is not finished planning it and he \"needs better emotional management.\" \n\nSince this is the only thing I have heard, and I have only been scheduled for one day, I am starting to get an obsessive thought pattern. I think \"he is doing this on purpose. He doesn't care if I am stressed out because I may not have a job!\" \n\nLogically, I think he is just overwhelmed with his life and may be having some personal problems but then a little voice asks, \"Did I do something wrong? Did I just get played? Am I stupid for not arranging another job this summer? How am I going to get money?!\" \n\nI have worked for four years with this guy and he has always been half-assed but never THIS half-assed. It feels very disrespectful to me. In between wondering if I am allowed to be angry about this, I am also starting to believe he is jealous of me and so he just wants to make me suffer. This is exactly what my Nmom's dynamics were with me. She was always jealous of me and tried to beat me down and make me small. \n\nI was going to start applying to other jobs and making enquiries through my network but I don't know if I should because I haven't heard back from this boss yet.

        "text": "I have workaholic/alcoholic mother with whom I am almost 5 months NC by my choice and a naive father on a different continent with whom I am LC not by my choice.\n\nWhen my dad left the country I was 11 and for several years he called **every** Sunday at 8 pm (my time; for real, once or twice he couldn't so he stayed up past midnight and called in the morning). Then he made my brother and I switch to skype. Thanks to my inflexibility I sounded irritated when he called every Sunday at random times but I couldn't voice what my problem was, so he started calling less and less.\n\nAfter a year of two I told him that if he can't call regularly, I'd prefer if he didn't call at all. This meant couple of months of NC. After that we made an agreement that he will send an e-mail day before he calls. This worked. \n\nI spent with him two months this year and part of me hoped that my relationship with him will be \"normal\" again.\n\nSince I left month ago he didn't call until today. It was after I sent him an e-mail asking if he's still alive because when I left he said that he'll call.\n\nThe reason why he didn't call or sent an e-mail the whole month was that he was working a lot and riding a motorcycle a lot. I would understand work, I grew up with workaholic so I am used to being less important than parent's work. But it feels shitty to be told that parent can't find 5/10 minutes to say \"Hi! How are you doing?\" but he can find time to ride a motorcycle.\n\nI feel disappointed. Not because he didn't call for a month but because I hoped that he will start acting like a dad and keep his word. Am I overreacting?",

        "text": "So my mother and I never had what you might call a happy relationship. I never had a feeling from her that I was loved or wanted, merely tolerated. My opinions, feelings, and desires were all considered less important and valid to her own, because obviously kids know nothing and shouldn't have their own autonomy. I had pretty bad anger issues from the get-go which I was forced to manage myself, but began having depressive episodes and panic attacks when puberty hit. I suspect this was one of those part-nature, part-nurture things. Personally, I hate lying, but learned quickly that it was the best recourse when dealing with my mother. Needed to be somewhere on time? Lie about when the thing starts so she'll leave early enough to get there. Don't want to participate in certain after school activity? Lie and say that it conflicts with something else you've already got going on. Want to participate in a non-approved activity? Lie and say you were studying when it was going on. \n\nThings got better when I moved away to college, and didn't have her breathing down my neck. I'd never been so grateful to be 200 miles away from my friends, even though I missed my dog like crazy. I began to learn how to set boundaries, how to do things I wanted to do without worrying about someone else's opinion of them, and I began learning how to love myself. Granted, every visit from her would usually result in a stress migraine and 5000 judgmental stares about my ability to clean up after myself, but it was better. I had my own life. I was an adult, and I wanted to be trusted to make my own decisions. This period in my life allowed me to let go of the idea that my mother and I would ever have a good relationship, and it was cathartic to be able to give no fucks. \n\nWhen college came to an end, I had a BFA and a full time job, but had to move back home so I could save up enough to live elsewhere. Two years later, that still hadn't happened when my mother was diagnosed with an inoperable, terminal brain tumour. Fortunately her large family swooped in to help take care of her so I could work full time, which became more difficult by the week as she deteriorated mentally and physically. Even with all of her memory problems associated with the tumour, she still remembered to tell me the second I was doing anything wrong. Even sick, she was insistent that she was fine, her family was overreacting, and that she'd be better soon (probably because she could never remember her diagnosis). \n\nShe died on Halloween last year, and honestly the worst part is how everyone expects me to be sad and broken up about it. For me, the pros far outweigh the cons. Thanks to life insurance, I paid off my student loans, and we were able to pay the mortgage until the house could be sold. Emotionally, I no longer have someone guilting me for my own existence not being what she wanted. I've noticed in the last 8 months that my emotional capacity has finally widened and deepened to what I had before I began having depressive episodes ten years before. I didn't used to cry at movies or books or friends stories before, because I couldn't allow myself to show that kind of emotion as a kid. My panic attacks have all but gone away, though I've learned that I'm predisposed to anxiety anyway. And best of all, I finally feel like a full person capable of making decisions about my life without being hindered or judged. \n\nI'm finally happy, so put it simply.",

That's it. Conversation over. I've been fired from my position, I suppose. \n\nNow that I'm free and independent there is literally nothing in my world to worry about. It's so... quiet. It's like I've been listening to angry death metal all my life and then someone suddenly switched it off. \n\nMy boyfriend is honest and kind and makes my life better in so many ways each day. No one cares what I do, what I wear, who I hang out with, what I eat, what my plans are for the future. No one questions me, no one has unrealistic expectations of me, no one cares if I stay up all night or if I listen to my music too loud. I don't have to listen out for passive aggressive warnings or censor what I say or get screamed at. \n\nMy life is quieter and more peaceful than a forest covered in snow in the middle of nowhere. \n\nMy brain isn't used to this level of peace and quiet. It keeps thinking, \"Surely there is something you must be doing wrong. Let's think about all of the things you should feel bad about. Are you sure you're not a horrible person? Maybe your boyfriend secretly hates you.\" \n\nI'm having a hard time believing that everything actually is okay. Could life really be this simple and honest and fair? Could I simply go to work, cook food, watch Netflix, be honest about who I am and make my own choices? It seems so simple yet so surreal... is this what life feels like for everyone else?",

        "text": "I moved in with three different roommates a year and a half ago. We all agreed on a fair way to contribute to expenses, and the first month everything seemed okay. As time went on, a roommate I will refer to as B, mysteriously lost his job. He stated that there was a coworker that was crazy and got him fired for no apparent reason. I believed this at first, because I didn't know B well enough to make accusations. We agreed we'd give him time to get on his feet and we all split the rent three ways.\n\nTime went on. B didn't make any attempt to find a job, and was being very territorial about me using the vanity mirror to get ready for my job. I worked at Tilted Kilt at the time. It's like Hooters for those who aren't familiar with the chain, and you do have to put a significant amount of effort into your appearance. B was getting angry that I was waking him up by using the bathroom near his room despite that I made an attempt to be as quiet as possible. I tried to let this slide off my back, because I wanted to keep myself away from conflict despite this person's unwillingness to contribute to the bills and attempt to be at least pleasant while he freeloaded.\n\nWhile I was away, he made some horrible comments about my mental health. I suffer from depression. One of my roommates knew this the time, and he used this as an opportunity to insinuate that I suffered from delusions. He accused me of making up my own boyfriend whom I never actually introduced to these people, because the house had gotten so toxic that I just didn't want him to be sucked into the drama. Despite that he's heard me converse with this person on the phone and has evidence that this person is real. He tried to twist that my own boyfriend was a figment of my own imagination, and started some very \"gaslight\" type tactics. He started making up that he had evidence that I was abusing OxyContin despite that I have no access to the drugs nor the financial means to support an expensive habit. If I went out to the bar, he'd accuse me of being an alcoholic and a bad influence on one of the other roommates.\n\nThis person would break the other roommates electronics and promise to pay them back. He never would. He never supplied any money towards the bills, and finally manipulated his way into turning my own housemates on me simply because he got intimidated that I was the top provider of the house and it was clear I was irritated that he was completely using us all.\n\nI finally had to leave, because he had turned my own living space into a war zone. I thought that would be the end of it, but he still continues to spread lies about me to anyone that knows me. I actually never even confronted him about the horrible gossip he was stirring while I lived with him, and the worst I did was express mild irritation. This person is bent on destroying my reputation, and has spread some horribly incriminating lies about me being involved in illegal activity.\n\nI'm trying to get my realty license which might already be difficult since I have a reckless driving conviction. Most people say I can still pass, but with him spreading gossip online I fear that it might come up when my name is googled. I have no proof that it was him, but the lies are all the same things he told other people about me.\n\nI really don't understand why someone would go to this extent to ruin my life long passed my last interaction with him. I understand that he grew up wealthy but his parents cut him off for unexplained reasons. Maybe hard work was something his family never taught him. He's still completely obsessed with destroying my life over a small disagreement. \n\nHe's always spreading lies about himself to look good. He's made up places he's worked, and lied that he was still with his SO long after the relationship ended. He's lied about other people that he's angry with to make himself appear better such as his ex boss and another one of my ex roommates whom he lied about physically assaulting his SO just because that person finally evicted him.\n\nI don't know what to do. All the harassment from this person is sending me into another pit of depression and I just need support.",

        "text": "Hi Guys, it’s been a tough week around here and though I was feeling pretty defeated by all the punches, in the end I’m here and feeling strong. And I got through this without therapy.\n\nHere’s what happened. I haven’t had therapy for almost three weeks at this point. Between my therapist going on vacation (twice) and my husband being out of town ( = no childcare), I haven’t been able to have a session. But, honestly, the past few sessions have been a bit awkward: I don’t feel like I have anything to talk about and we sit there staring at each other for a good chunk of it.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the beginning of this week. My husband left for a conference on the other side of the world for a week. Before he’d even landed my body exploded in a severe allergy attack - still not sure to what. I’m talking hives on top of hives. I was completely covered and it spread throughout my body for the duration of the day and night. They seemed to have subsided the next day only to come back again in the evening, less severe but still bad and sooooo itchy.\n\nThrough all of this my very-intense-and-hard-to-manage toddler is freaking out because Dad isn’t here and her routine is all messed up. I tried to schedule a lot of fun things to do, but even normally she is a handful and single-parenting her is exhausting. I haven’t been my best mom-self this week, though it wasn’t all terrible.\n\nAnd so, breaking out of the old script, I started asking for help from my friends. Mostly, they just listened and offered moral support. But on the first night of the allergy attack I was also having a bit of trouble breathing. So I let my neighbor know what was going on and that I might need help (yay me!). Everyone has been great. People have been checking up on me, bringing stuff by to help entertain my daughter, and just generally making me feel like I don’t have to do it all alone (general script from Nmom).\n\nOn the third day of being without hubby I woke to an email from my FLEA-ridden/Nsister. You may recall from my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4ow4sf/feeling_the_weight_of_two_years_no_contact/?st=iq36p7wy&amp;sh=0798cd94) that I just found out she was pregnant and was feeling kind of bad about not being a part of her life. Well, apparently she had the baby. I thought I had put the feelings to rest when I discovered she was pregnant, but I guess I didn’t do it well enough. It hit me hard. Her email contained pictures and the last one was of her, baby, hubby, and my mother hovering over them with the caption “My amazing birth team!” I literally almost threw up. My Nsister, who clearly has PTSD, has become so enmeshed with Nmom that she is turning into her. It’s sad that she doesn’t see how poisonous Nmom is, but it’s not really my problem. That one picture verified the reason that I no longer have contact with them: they are all toxic.\n\nSo that was the third blow for this trying week and the one I thought was going to defeat me. I didn’t have the choice to collapse, a child is dependent on me, so I continued. I spoke with my hubby and looked for support from my friends. And I got through it.\n\nThat afternoon I had an appointment with the doctor to check out what was going on with this allergy attack. The hives had cleared by this time so the doc wasn’t very impressed. I have a VERY sensitive system with lots of allergies and recently had a bad reaction to Zyrtec, so I am extremely wary of taking more drugs. (BTW, public service announcement: one of the not-listed side affects of Zyrtec is depression and anxiety. If you are on this medication and have noticed an unexplained shift in your depression/anxiety, consider that you may not be tolerating the meds well.) And the doc just pushed and pushed and pushed the drugs. I did a good job standing up for myself and saying that I did NOT want medication, I just wanted to try and find out what new thing I am allergic to and to make sure that my body is ok now because I did have some trouble breathing. They were very dismissive, did not listen, and I generally felt that they didn’t believe me and thought I was making a big deal out of nothing. I know my body and I know that level of reaction is not normal. Anyway, it was extremely frustrating and very much mimicked how Nmom used to treat my physical complaints.\n\nToday is the fourth day and things are going a bit better. My therapist emailed to see how I’m doing and I told her what has been going on. She responded but I didn’t find her response to be that helpful and I do feel like I got enough support from my other resources. Which is a great thing! This is what’s supposed to be happening, right? You learn how to form attachments in therapy and then you start having them in other relations. You learn healthy vulnerability and build strong relationships like that.\n\nSo I’m wondering, am I done with therapy? I’ve been doing it for two years, I’ve made a lot of progress, but it seems to have stalled now and I don’t feel that crazy dependence on my therapist anymore. I don’t think my PTSD is completely under control yet, but maybe this is something I have to do by myself now that I have the awareness. What do you think? Have you “finished” therapy? How did you know you were done?\n\nThanks a lot for reading and hope you are having a good week. Two and a half more days until hubby is back, yay!",

That's the life of the scapegoat. You're always the guilty one. So you're always the one that needs to reach out first, take the high road, apologize even! Sure they're twice your age and you're the youngest in the entire family. That only matters when they're trying to convince you how \"distorted\" your view of reality is. How you caused all this drama yourself. How even if they were wrong, they're family and YOU need to forgive. Well I finally learned what happens when we don't do what they want us to. Nothing. Nothing happens.\n\n\n\nI can't even begin to explain what a slap\nIn the face it was- to have them drop\noff the face of the planet like they did. I was raised by these people, they knew me-inside and out. They changed my diapers! I think that's what was the hardest. You try to convince yourself that the people that watched you grow from a baby into adulthood don't actually know you or your character at all. It doesn't work. Or worse, some of them do know you but they still hate you for it all the same. Fortunately for me I finally know now that it wasn't me they hated, it was the boundaries I stood for that they hated. That I stepped outside of their realm of Narc abuse and stood UP for myself and my husband. That I was selfish and stubborn but I needed to be, for the betterment of my family.\n\n\nHowever, even in knowing that, it still physically hurts to think about how easy it was for them to collectively drop me from their lives like a hot potatoe. I've had a child since then, and I'm about to have another. Our first boy after 3 girls. I know they know but they just don't care. No cards, no calls, not even a text or Facebook message. The only extended family I have ever known and they haven't even met my daughter, expressed interest in my son, or asked how my oldest two have grown. How can you hate me for not accepting or understanding the \"unconditional love\" and \"joy\" of family then exclude me and isolate me from yours so easily? \n\nHow can you pretend I don't exist when I've been an essential part of your lives for the past 25 years? Who do you tell about Santa at Christmas now that all the small children have left with me? At every birth or death or party or reunion or wedding, how do you invite every single sibling of mine except me? How can you be so hateful? How could you do that to someone you raised and molded and cared for and watched grow up? How could we have been as close as we were? How could I have loved and idolized you as much as I did? \n\n\nA couple shitty arguments happen and because I don't come groveling back to you, apologizing for things that I didn't do -I'm the spiteful bitch that deserves to be shunned for years and years? Fuck you guys, fuck your abuse and manipulation. I shouldn't even want you back. Every minute of every day that I wish I had you back hate myself for more and more. Fuck you for doing this to me. \n\nNow I know I have to stand my ground even further. But no worries I will stop hurting eventually. But you won't. Because as long as I'm not there you'll have to have someone else to hate. Which means more death and destruction and bitterness will always be flowing between you all. And your daughters will hate you and your sons will resent you. And your parents will blame you for all their hardships until they're on their deathbed and beyond. \n\nBut I will have my happy albeit small family. And we will love each other and care for each other. We will support each other's marriages and never judge or talk bad about one another behind each other's backs. We will celebrate each others accomplishments and hurt when each one of us hurts. We will all grown individually and uniquely and will learn embrace and encourage every difference between us. We will be there for one another, not out of guilt or shame, but because we want to be. We will thrive. \n\nAll it is going to take is more time. And for all the scape goats out there, you deserve more, don't ever forget that. ",

I was afraid she was going to start blowing up my phone with harassment, but it didn't happen. After that it sunk in that she just did not care. I moved on. At first I would have between 1-3 night terrors about her each week. They subsided after a few months, thankfully.\n\nIn that time we were NC I processed a lot. I was able to see more of what I went through. Holy god damn. More and more memories resurfaced and everything started to make more sense. \n\nThen around 11:30pm on my birthday I saw I had a voicemail from my N. Surprisingly, I did not panic. I felt nothing. Well, maybe a little shock because I wasn't expecting it. The message was pretty generic. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since then. I haven't called her back. I'm not ready to. I don't know if I ever will be. I still feel numb to be honest. \n\nI just wanted to share. Thanks for listening. ",

        "text": "I think I write this here to find answers.\nI started with IFS-Therapy to work through a \"weird\" feeling I had about the relationship with my mum (and dad). After endless google searches I found websites about dealing with narcissistic parents (mothers) and I could relate to it very much. That's how I ended up with the therapy method itself - I've never heard of it before and was quite open to the experience. \n\nPart of this process was a short break up with my mother and I think I made progress in that sense that I try to stand my ground against her now.\n\nHowever, now over a year into therapy and with the topic around family dynamics \"solved\" (or more or less ignored, cause I did not want to talk about it anymore), I felt more and more frustrated with the IFS method. \n\nI feel like the therapy has \"no purpose\" anymore, no goal, no structure.\n\nI have quite a strong \"intellectual part\" that dictates most of the sessions and provides content to talk about. But the struggle is that this hinders me from connecting with any form of feeling or with those parts that probably need to be heard and healed.\nI have phases every few months, where I could throw myself in front of a train, but as sudden and intense as these impulses come, as sudden they are gone again. And when I try to feel them again in a \"formal session\" afterwards I can't connect with them, I just feel this blank emptiness. I struggle to visualise any parts, or talk to them or interact with them. I feel \"dumb\" imagining myself talking to parts within myself...\n\nI then challenged the method itself in the form of a strong sceptical part, that came in everytime I tried to connect, saying that it won't work anyway and won't change anything.\n\nBecause of that feeling that I thought I did not make any progress, I got so frustrated that I asked my therapist for a break now. \n\n\nI wonder if anyone who works with IFS ever had this experience of frustration, or that they feel blank and could not connect with any parts?\nHow did you overcome this?\nHow can you connect with parts?\nHow do you interact with them? Like, do you feel them, see them, hear them?\nHow do you reach Self and not be in parts anymore?\nWhen do you know/feel you are \"healed\" or solved something inside you?\n\n\nThanks to anyone for reading and for sharing your thoughts...",

I got stronger and they tried to behave in another way. The result is that we're now able to spend time together - actually it's kind of nice. Every time they start to insult me or someone else, I distance myself. Perhaps they realized in order to have contact they have to behave in a respectful manner.\n\n\nSo fast forward to now: I could be really happy, but I'm not. I feel guilty every time they are nice. After meeting them and them saying wonderful and encouraging things, I cry.\n\n\nMy Nmother actually seems to rewrite our family history, trying to imagine ourself as a loving family. E.g.: \"the best time in my life was the day you were born!\" (When I was about eleven she told me she didn't want to have me, I'm a burden, she wanted to abort me and that I'm the reason, my parents may  be getting divorced. - nope they didn't btw)\n\n\nI don't correct her because the reality seems to destroy her (I did a few years ago and she cried weeks - this conversation was the reason for her change) and atm she's behaving like the mother I always wanted to have. Loving, proud, encouraging.\n\n\n\nBut I can't help, every time I see them I sob afterwards without really knowing why. Plus I feel really guilty for somehow not being a better person (but: they don't say anything like that.)\n\n\n\nBtw: please excuse the grammar and all - English is not my native language and at the moment I'm on the couch sobbing and being unable to start the computer in order to properly check my text. \n\n\nSo, does anybody else feel that way and why? I really want to understand these feelings...\n\nEdit: added \"N\" to \"mother\"",

        "text": "Background: DoNM, NC for two years, NC with my three siblings as well: Flying Monkey little bro, Flying Monkey and FLEA-ridden or maybe N sister, and FLEA-ridden other brother.\n\nI’ve been missing my family lately and the feeling got a bit worse when I found out that my sister is pregnant. She is five years my junior and we grew up best friends and each other’s protectors against my Nmom’s rages. But when I moved out and she started getting the brunt of Nmom’s insanity, things started to change. Instead of turning against Nmom, my sister folded herself up and conformed to fit Nmom’s desires. At this point, she has become so attached to Nmom that she is turning into her. The last time I spoke with my sister she was complaining about her fiancé in exactly the same way Nmom used to bitch about Edad - with bitterness and contempt. It’s very sad to me but our relationship hasn’t existed for three years already (longer than I’ve been NC).\n\nI’m sad to be missing out on her life. I wasn’t able to attend her wedding because I’d just gone NC and was in a very unstable place. I understood that my parents/family were toxic and I knew they were not safe for my young child to be around. I suspected they were also not good for me to be around and now I think I was right. And yet I still have a lot of sadness and a bit of residual guilt for missing her big day. Now I am missing more important events in her life.\n\nI’m not really sure if there is any solution to this. I still think that family is too toxic to be around and, though I’m stronger, I’m not yet strong enough to deal with the onslaught I know will happen if I resume contact.\n\nThinking about all of this I just really felt the weight of how long two years has been. On one hand it seems to have passed quickly, but I think about all the things that have happened to me/my immediate family in those two years and it seems like forever. My daughter is a completely different person than when they last saw her at 15 months old. I am pretty different too. I wonder about them, has my little brother graduated college yet? How is my sister liking being married? Has she gained any perspective? And I think about Edad a lot too, I understand him better now that I know about PTSD and have learned more about myself. I wish I could share this information with him, let him know that he doesn’t have to be under Nmom’s thumb.\n\nI haven’t contacted any of them, though, because I honestly don’t think it would make much of a difference. I’ve felt a lot of hostility from all of them and no understanding. Plus, they all report back to Nmom and I still have no desire to have anything to do with her.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to get some of this out. Maybe you could share some of your NC stories too, if you’d like. Thanks for reading!",

        "text": "I don't know why it is so hard for me to try the simplest things, but it is.  Do something for myself?  Why would I ever do such a crazy thing?  (sarcasm)  \n\nI do struggle in trying new types of self-care...\n\nSo, I have a lot of sensory sensitivity.  One of my biggest sensory struggles is auditory sensitivity.    I get overwhelmed by loud or repetitive noises quickly.  \n\nI also have two very young children who are very loud.  My three year-old has been exploring ways to make mommy react.  He's a great kid and I don't mean to say that he's not.  He's amazing.  But, this is age appropriate behavior.  Kids do observe their parents and explore their parents sensitivities... especially at this young age.  And, ya know, three year-olds like to repeat things and loudly.  I also have an 18 month-old like enjoys screaming.  Sometimes the noise is overwhelming enough that I feel like I can't breathe or think, especially when we are in the car.  Usually turning up an interesting (to them) song on the radio will stop them.  Or, I'll start asking them questions... my kids love questions and it helps them learn to think (What is your favorite planet?  How do you think magnets work?  What is your favorite kind of doggy?  What friends would you like to see tomorrow?)  I have ways to help manage the situations, but I still feel like my nerves are on fire no matter how well I manage the situation.  I feel like my skin has been ripped off.  I just want to put my hands over my ears and sob (this has never actually happened).  \n\nYesterday and after *YEARS* of knowing I should try this, I actually took the foam ear plugs out of my purse and put them in my ears while my daughter screeched in boredom due to a long car drive.  I could still hear her... but I could still breathe.  I felt like I had skin.  I felt like a normal person.  I could hear the screaming and not feel like I was losing my mind on the inside.  I could still hear every word my children said, which is important to me.  I need to hear if they are in pain or scared or something.  But, I had enough distance from the stimuli to still think clearly and still feel like me while a child screeched a few feet away from me.  It felt like a miracle.  Funny thing, of course, that it was a few cents worth of foam in my ears... but it felt like a miracle.\n\nWhy did it take me so long to try that?  \n\nI guess I have tried so many things and most of them don't work.  It makes me pessimistic and wary to try one more damn thing that isn't going to work...  But, when I do find something that does work, it **feels so damn good.**\n\nI've been dreading this huge road trip we have coming up soon.  18 hours in a car with two children who don't like long drives.  :(  So, I ordered [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWKKJJK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), more foam ear plugs in various sizes and a sleeping mask (I am the lightest sleeper ever and I want to drive to sleep that night, so that I can take a long driving shift in the morning).  Hopefully with these tools at hand, I will be able to handle the trip this time without feeling like I am trapped in sensory hell.  \n\nWe have all the other normal things planned that any parents would for a road trip like this with very young children.  There will be long stops at parks and rest stops to let the kids run around and play.  We are planning on ordering tablets and new toys to help the kids tolerate sitting for so long.  We will probably do a large portion of the driving at night, so they will (hopefully) sleep through it.  I want a DVD player for the car.  Hopefully, with these things in place, my son won't get so stressed out that he projectile vomits... sigh... as he normally does.  Poor kid.  Well... we did all these things last time and he projectile vomited several times, so realistically I can really only hope he's outgrown it...\n\nI wish flying was an option for us, but I simply won't do it.  I love flying, but my husband and son have deadly food allergies.  If they were to have a reaction on the plane an epi pen only keeps you alive long enough to get to a hospital and being trapped on an airplane with an anaphylactic reaction can be deadly.  We're driving.  \n\nAnyway.... hopefully this trip is better.  My son is older.  I will have ways to escape enough of the noise to feel human.  My daughter is little, but isn't a vomiter.  Once we actually get to where we are going, it's going to be awesome.  I'm going to try to keep my eye on the prize.  Fingers are crossed that this trip goes better than the last one.  \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Precursor; I'm sorry I seems to ramble, this turned into venting..\n\nSo with my Nfamily, growing up there was no apologizing to each other. You either didn't talk to each other till a holiday present itself, in which you had to, or the offender pretended like nothing happened until the offended was over it. \n\nThe times I've attempted to apologize, it was met with sheer anger, and reiterating how horrible I was for doing what ever I did, and that they would never forgive me. If I stood my ground in any way it would make it even worse. So it was either I pretend like nothing is wrong, or become submissive, admit everything is always my fault, apologize and still get yelled at about everything I've ever done wrong. \n\nNow that I'm adult, I understand that this isn't normal. However any time that I'm in the position where I need to apologize, I can't. It's not that I don't want to, or that I don't feel bad. It's that I get the most horrible anxiety and freeze. I feel like if I do that it's going to end the relationship. \n\nI don't even know how to properly apologize. I know I'm suppose to say I'm sorry. I'm good at seeing things from other peoples perspective, so I usually understand why someone is upset with me. I know I need to learn to communicate how to explain that I understand where they're coming from but I also need to learn how to communicate where I'm coming from with out coming off offensively.\n\nHere's the situation I'm currently facing. \n\nThe whole reason I even want to apologize is because I have a co-worker who's a manager, as am I, and I over see a department that includes two of her sisters. She also knows a lot about my department, and I've only recently become a manager. She had become my go-to with trying to navigate being a leader to people who don't yet see me as such. Shes very encouraging, however she also excludes me from decisions, as well as reveal information that should be coming from me. I know a large part of this is due to the fact that her sisters vent to her, and so shes almost playing middle man. She also hates confrontation. So when they would vent to her about things, she would reveal moral boosting information that I was working on. If they had an issue, she would correct it instead of either her coming to me, or encouraging them to come to me. I spoke with her on several occasions about this, but it continued to be an issue, and she told me to let her know when she would do this. She revealed something once again, and I told her as soon as I knew. She became EXTREMELY defensive, and said she was trying to make sure they didn't quit. You know when someone is ready to argue, and I didn't want to do such, so I just said ok. Honestly the only thing I feel I did wrong was my delivery. I wasn't coordinated and I just said that I was planning on telling them during our meeting scheduled for that day. Literally the conversation last less that a minute. She then came to my office and told me she was taking a mental health day, and hasn't spoken to me in several weeks now. This is why I would like to learn how to apologize without having to take all of the blame. I don't think I was in the wrong with broaching the subject, and I'm sympathetic to her being in the middle. However I don't think it warrants receiving the silent treatment, and since she upset with me, it's also made it very uncomfortable to be around her sisters. One of them just blatantly will not do the task I assign her, and ignores me when ever I'm in the office, or gives one word answers. Mind you, this co-workers is also our HR.  \n\n\nAnyone have any advice on how to tackle this issue?",

I was trying so hard to get my ADHD under control and learn how to deal with it and she just cut me to the quick. She called me this for weeks until I eventually stopped reacting to it. (Having gone back to college helped!). I just remember how hurtful that was. I even told her and she didn't care. I don't remember exactly what she said but it was something along the lines of \"get over it\" or \" I was just joking. Don't take it so seriously\" followed by the continued mocking. \n\nSo now I'm reminded of this every time I see something about the new dory movie. ",

How to stand up for yourself, compassionately, while not creating more drama or being sucked into a circular conversation?\n\nMy Ex husband often gaslit me, which would result in circular conversations, and I had a hard time not being sucked into one. It would lead to me forgetting my primary agenda that I came to him with, and instead of solving that I'd end up feeling character deficient and a horrible person in general.\nTwo years of therapy and I know now how these things work. I can identify emotional abuse now (we're apart for 3 years) and shoot him down/call him out (we have a kid together so some contact remains). I've worked on my FLEAs successfully, life is good.  \n\n\nYet. My new (ex) boyfriend. He's the opposite of my ex - which was nice but also not. He's totally enmeshed with his ex - not emotionally or romantically, but he enables her depression (they also have a kid). I told him this is bad, we spoke about him being codependent. I said he needs to be divorced, or at least in the process of, as I don't want to be with a married man. He said he'll put things in motion, and I agreed to give a relationship a try. After all, I've been like him in some ways, and I like to think I made a recovery.\n\nI didn't tell him but for myself, I set an ultimatum of one year. I've told him how I dislike him being married, and he knew that it's a deal breaker. Yet, he didn't even file for divorce during that year, and found new excuses to not do so in the near future. So I broke up with him - amicably. I thought it was sad, but his enmeshment with his ex really bugged me and made me not want to be with him. I explained myself, that I think he needs to sort out his mess before starting a new relationship, and he seemed to not understand. He thinks, filing for divorce might drive his ex into a psychological breakdown leading to problems for their kid, and that I should be more compassionate with him.\n\nNow, during the week after breaking up, he sends me texts every couple days or so telling me about his life, and once, asked me to call because he had a difficult day. He's spoken about divorce with his ex, and unsurprisingly, she had a psychological breakdown, and is now hospitalised for severe depression and psychosis (which he takes as he can't file for divorce until she's better). I just thought \"good that I'm out of this\". Still, he seemed to need a friend, and I called him, we had a friendly chat - no implication of getting back together at all. \n\nToday, I get a declaration of his never-ending love for me, followed by him telling me that I really still love him and that I have many and deep feelings for him. He's clearly infatuated with me.\n\nI replied \"No, you are mistaken. Also, I do not want to get back together.\"\n\nFor which I was proud - I realised he told me how I should feel, I realised I do not feel that way, I've spoken my mind, and I thought I was - given the situation - still quite compassionate. \n\nHe replies\n\"It's impressive how fast you can change your mind\"\n\nAnd it damned drives me crazy. I know I shouldn't answer. But I want to shout at him that \n\"No, I did not change my mind.\"\nI've been consistent about not wanting to be with a married man all through the time we know each other. It drives me nuts to leave it like this. I don't want be told what and how I feel. And if I'm told, I want to defend myself without ending in a circular argument. I didn't respond but am still fuming.\n\nHow can I learn to not give a shit? Responding to him creates drama, I don't want drama. I however also want to stand up for myself, not just let him do that to me. What is the correct reaction? I feel like I can't do human interactions. \n\nThanks for reading. It's not a big thing. But it needed out. \n\nEdited for typos",

        "text": "When I was around 9 or 10 years old a part of me started to develop its own distinct sense of humor/commentary that revolved around privately, secretly, just to myself mocking or internally rolling my eyes at the way my parents would get into utterly stupid bickering matches over minor things or work themselves up into a stressed frenzy about stuff that any healthy adult would see as no big deal. Like the dishes. Holy fuck I couldn't tell you how many tense standoffs and passive-aggressive blame-a-thons happened over dishes or other completely mundane kitchen things. Their addiction to stressing - and to stressing each other out, and especially to dumping stress on their children - was very damaging to me for reasons that nobody here needs me to explain. It shaped the cancerous growth of my inner critic, the part of me that's modeled after some of the worst sides of my parents and therefore tries to find fault with everything I do (or don't do) and see danger everywhere.\n\nSardonic humor has been very important for me in my process of healing and making sense of the absurd, insane world we live in. I've been discovering that one very effective way of [shrinking my inner critic](http://pete-walker.com/shrinkingInnerCritic.htm), when I'm in the right fame of mind to do it, is to employ that same old spirit of \"god my parents are ridiculous\" against the destructive ways of my own inner critic. A couple of examples for inspiration:\n\n*Oh shit that bus is coming in 5 minutes and I don't even have my shoes on god damnit why do I always procrastinate up to the last minute shit I'm gonna be late* | Oh my GOD! Shoes - how will I possibly get my shoes on in time?! I could be a whole 15 MINUTES late to meet up with my friends who will be so enraged they will literally murder me and eat my bones!!!\n\n*Ugh I still haven't taken out that trash, it's been sitting there for... how many days now? ... gross...  I'm becoming a hoarder who doesn't even bother to take care of himself* | Wow I am literally trash man. I am made of trash. Nobody else is ever lazy about chores. I am uniquely terrible and utterly repulsive for allowing a single armful of useless stuff to accumulate. My living space will inevitably get buried under the weight of my self-neglect and there is nothing I can EVER do to stop this outcome.\n",

        "text": "My boyfriend's mom is an N. He finally accepted it today. My own parents are Ns and I called them today. Even they said what my boyfriends mom did yesterday was uncalled for. \n\n\nBasically, I woke up with severe pain in my side yesterday. I called all my friends first but they couldn't bring me to the hospital. I called boyfriend's mom. All she said was \"I can't, I need to go to church, sorry you'll have to call an ambulance\" *click* Now it was one of those fake sorrys where you know she didn't mean it. I ended up calling an ambulance which is going to put me more in debt. I ended up with kidney stones. Boyfriend called his mom today to yell at her for this bullshit telling here there was no reason I needed to call an ambulance. She told him that I could have walked the 2 miles to the hospital and when he yelled at her for it she hung up on him saying \"I don't have to take this, I have to go, bye\" *click* I told my own Nmom about this and even she says it was uncalled for and that I shouldn't have had to go through it, and she has openly admitted to others of hating me. Boyfriend looked at me after hearing my Nmom actually defend me for once and said \"You're right, my mom is a narcissist.\" Finally we have some progress!!!",

        "text": "I posted previously about leaving a job and coming back to my home state. I wasn't returning to where I was living before because I had gone NC with my parents and had previously lived with my Ngrandmother who was cruel as all hell. \n\nI have managed to finally end up partially spending some time at a friend's while I job hunt, which has provided some stability and security. However, I've been using some of this time to figure out what services are available to those living in their car around here, since I may be right back out there at some point, and this is what has led me to posting here instead of one of the subs about homelessness.\n\nI have been outright LECTURED about having \"too many resources\" and lectured about how I'm supposed to be using them and how I'm doing homelessness wrong! I was treated like I was wasting social service's time. Yesterday I had a non-profit straight up tell me what I am supposed to be doing and didn't even give me a choice as to whether I should stay at their shelter (the case worker wants to strongarm me into it despite that they told me they don't have a spot, even though that's not what I even called them for) or for applying to a nearby job. They ignored the fact that I had to drive 40 minutes just to get up there and can't keep heading up there every other day while I stay with my friends. I also have had one of these people raise her voice and told me I'm not allowed to deny certain services and how I'm blocking myself out of options. \n\nIt is one thing to be a relatively healthy adult from an okay background having to deal with the nastiness I'm finding from \"services\" while temporarily living in my car on and off. It's another to having been RBN like I have in this situation. I may/may not have PTSD but each of these experiences has left me feeling COMPLETELY off-kilter, slammed to the ground figuratively, and has ripped my confidence and sense of personal power to shreds. My pals noticed yesterday that I just seemed to be totally listless. The lack of true help, the lack of being listened to, the lack of being asked what I AM actually looking for, and being talked to like a totally irresponsible child repeatedly brings up huge issues from the way I was raised and is causing me to isolate myself and refuse to even continue trying to find things that might actually assist me while I try to get back on my feet.

        "text": "My uncle passed away two years ago and my aunt has recently been grieving very hard so my nmom convinced her to take Zoloft. After about a week on the drug, she had some sideeffects where she began to get very fearful, morbid and anxious, shaky and weepy. She lives in another state and her neighbor told my edad she is not sleeping, eating and not going out. My edad got her on a plane and brought her to stay with nmom and him. He said my nmom is making faces, saying, \"Oh, she's crying again?\" Today I talked to my aunt and she broke down and said she feels very bad about putting pressure on my parents' relationship. She obviously senses that my mom is unhappy with her there. But what she doesn't realize is that my nmom is unhappy because she is no longer the sole focus of my father's attention. True to his enabling nature he said, \"She's not the number one priority in my life right now. She always has to be the center of attention.\" \n\nMy edad told me I just gotta do what is right for me right now, as I am very busy in my life and can't race there to help out, as is the enmeshed tendency that I feel but logically know I can't do, not only because I am busy but because I get lost in that dynamic. \n\nAnyway, what a spoiled brat my mother is. Doesn't even have empathy for a grieving widow who is having a bad reaction to the medication my mom convinced her to go on. \n\n",

        "text": "Had to edit and resubmit\n\nI normally just lurk but this is eating me up inside and I need to get out my story. I left my narcissistic, abusive ex several months ago. But he didn't leave me. He haunts my dreams and I have constant flashbacks of the abuse.\n\nYes, I'm in therapy. It helps to an extent. But it's like every week I remember something he did to me and I break down. I was pregnant and so vulnerable when I was with him. An emotional, hormonal wreck. I started keeping a journal of the things he said and did during my pregnancy because he made me feel like I was crazy and imagining it all. \n\nSome highlights include:\n\n-getting angry at me for rubbing my pregnant belly, demanding me to stop because it was annoying him\n\n-snooping through my journals, phone and laptop in order to find evidence of....something? He always accused me of cheating.\n\n-threatening to cheat on me and look at porn if I didn't do sexual things for him\n\n-ruining any vacation we went on by screaming at me for something and instigating fights\n\n-calling me a b****, c*** and w**** anytime I tried to disagree with him or stand up for myself\n\n-constantly looking at porn and on dating sites\n\n-relationship ultimately ended when he became physical\n\nThing is...he admitted to me he has physically assaulted his ex gfs and had horrible relations with them....he knows he has a problem. But yet I was always blamed.\n\nI think one of the things that bothers me most is how....charming and well respected he is in the community. He does quite well for himself and looks like a conservative, upstanding citizen. To the public and his family he appears to be this wonderful person and I'm viewed as the crazy ex who was making his life Hell.\n\nI just want these thoughts of him to stop. I want to stop obsessing over why he treated me so horribly and why nothing I did satisfied him. I want to stop caring who he dates next.\n\nI worry so much for our daughter. But there's nothing more to be done. Been there, done that with the court. Unfortunately verbal and emotional abuse just aren't taken into account. \n\nI'm just tired of worrying, tired of feeling like shit about myself and just want all thoughts of him to disappear so I can feel whole again.",

Maybe I just need encouragement dealing with this bullshit.\nI don't know. Thank you for reading. ",
