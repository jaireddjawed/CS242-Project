I do think Epicurus had an original view on leisure, and perhaps combined with his withdrawal from society (I'm assuming, if he were around now he would probably withdraw from the job market), it makes me wonder whether he was against work. I'm also aware he wrote quite a bit, so he wasn't lazy by any means.\n\nSo basically, what is his view on work, and how can we acquire the basic stuff (wisdom/education, food, water, electricity, etc) without money? \n\n",

Here is the place ask any questions you have, or offer your own insights. Have you spotted a work of art, a book, with clear Epicurean themes? \n\nTo get the discussion rolling I’ll use the suggested question- What are we to make of the Epicurean relationship with poetry?\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get into Epicurean philosophy is Lucretius’ great poem ‘On the nature of things.’ Yet we read in Diogenes Laertius that ‘Only the wise man will be able to converse correctly about music and poetry, without however actually writing poems himself.’ This suggests a deep distrust on the part of Epicurus for the ability to pass on wisdom through poetry. Is this to mean that beauty has no place in philosophy? Is it that poetry itself is a bad medium for philosophy? Can we tie Epicurus’ idea to Plato’s thought that in the ideal Republic poets would be banished?\n\nReply to any of these questions or ask your own.",

        "text": "The following comes from Plutarch's life of Pyrrhus and relates a conversation he had with an advisor called Cineas. It has a very definite Epicurean feel.\n\n\"Now, there was a certain Cineas, a man of Thessaly, with a reputation for great wisdom, who had been a pupil of Demosthenes the orator, and was quite the only public speaker of his day who was thought to remind his hearers, as a statue might, of that great orator's power and ability. Associating himself with Pyrrhus, and sent by him as ambassador to the cities, he confirmed the saying of Euripides, to wit,\n\n \"all can be won by eloquence\nThat even the sword of warring enemies might gain.\"\n\n\n2 At any rate, Pyrrhus used to say that more cities had been won for him by the eloquence of Cineas than by his own arms; and he continued to hold Cineas in especial honour and to demand his services. It was this Cineas, then, who, seeing that Pyrrhus was eagerly preparing an expedition at this time to Italy, and finding him at leisure for the moment, drew him into the following discourse. \"The Romans, O Pyrrhus, are said to be good fighters, and to be rulers of many warlike nations; if, then, Heaven should permit us to conquer these men, how should we use our victory?\" \n\n3 And Pyrrhus said: \"Thy question, O Cineas, really needs no answer; the Romans once conquered, there is neither barbarian nor Greek city there which is a match for us, but we shall at once possess all Italy, the great size and richness and importance of which no man should know better than thyself.\" \n\nAfter a little pause, then, Cineas said: \"And after taking Italy, O King, what are we to do?\" 4 \n\nAnd Pyrrhus, not yet perceiving his intention, replied: \"Sicily is near, and holds out her hands to us, an island abounding in wealth and men, and very easy to capture, for all is faction there, her cities have no government, and demagogues are rampant now that Agathocles is gone.\"\n\n \"What thou sayest,\" replied Cineas, \"is probably true; but will our expedition stop with the taking of Sicily?\"\n\n 5 \"Heaven grant us,\" said Pyrrhus, \"victory and success so far; and we will make these contests but the preliminaries of great enterprises. For who could keep his hands off Libya, or Carthage, when that city got within his reach, a city which Agathocles, slipping stealthily out of Syracuse and crossing the sea with a few ships, narrowly missed taking? And when we have become masters here, no one of the enemies who now treat us with scorn will offer further resistance; there is no need of saying that.\" \n\n6 \"None whatever,\" said Cineas, \"for it is plain that with so great a power we shall be able to recover Macedonia and rule Greece securely. But when we have got everything subject to us, what are we going to do?\" \n\nThen Pyrrhus smiled upon him and said: \"We shall be much at ease, and we'll drink bumpers, my good man, every day, and we'll gladden one another's hearts with confidential talks.\" \n\n7 And now that Cineas had brought Pyrrhus to this point in the argument, he said: \"Then what stands in our way now if we want to drink bumpers and while away the time with one another? Surely this privilege is ours already, and we have at hand, without taking any trouble, those things to which we hope to attain by bloodshed and great toils and perils, after doing much harm to others and suffering much ourselves.\"\n\n8 By this reasoning of Cineas Pyrrhus was more troubled than he was converted; he saw plainly what great happiness he was leaving behind him, but was unable to renounce his hopes of what he eagerly desired.\"\n\n",

        "text": "D. E. W. Wormell's analysis traced the origin of the Seven Deadly Sins to Lucretius' *On the Nature of Things*. There are two passages in particular:\n\n&gt;These same men having fled as exiles from their native lands,\n\n&gt;Banished from the eyes of men, with blood upon their hands\n\n&gt;From some dastardly deed, beset with every kind of woe,\n\n&gt;Nevertheless keep living, and wherever these wretches go,\n\n&gt;Appease their ancestors, and put black livestock^1 to the knife,\n\n&gt;And send down offerings to spirits of the afterlife.\n\n&gt;The more harsh that their hardships are, the harder they hold on\n\n&gt;To superstition. To truly take the measure of a man,\n\n&gt;You must observe him in the midst of trial and tribulation—\n\n&gt;Then, from the bottom of their hearts, men say what they believe;\n\n&gt;The mask is torn away, and what remains cannot deceive.\n\n&gt;**Take Avarice and the blind drive of Ambition**:^2 both may draw\n\n&gt;Wretched men to step outside the limits of the law—\n\n&gt;Often even as partners and accomplices in crime—\n\n&gt;As each man, day and night, strives harder than the next to climb\n\n&gt;Atop the pyramid of power. It is largely the dread\n\n&gt;Of death on which these open wounds of life thrive and are fed,\n\n&gt;For Vile Disgrace and Bitter Want seem so far from the state\n\n&gt;Of a sweet, established life, they almost loiter at Death’s gate.^3\n\n&gt;Compelled by an unfounded fear, men, to evade such trouble,\n\n&gt;Amass wealth by the blood of civil war, and they redouble\n\n&gt;Their riches in their greed, heaping one murder on another.\n\n&gt;Stone-hearted, they take pleasure in the sad death of a brother,\n\n&gt;And are suspicious of the suppers served up by their kin.\n\n—Lucretius, *The Nature of Things*, 3.47-73\n\n\n\n&gt;And yet what dangers threaten if the mind is not washed clear,\n\n&gt;What battles we unwillingly invite into the heart!\n\n&gt;How biting are desire’s cares that worry man apart,\n\n&gt;How menacing the fears! **And then consider Pride and Wrath**\n\n&gt;**And Lust—and the catastrophes which are their aftermath**—\n\n&gt;**And Gluttony and Sloth.**^4 And he who’s conquered all these, then,\n\n&gt;And banished them from the mind—not by the sword, but by the pen—\n\n&gt;Shouldn’t he be numbered with the gods and not with men?—\n\n&gt;Especially because of the holy wisdom he would preach\n\n&gt;Concerning the deathless gods themselves, and since, when he would teach,\n\n&gt;He unfolded the whole Nature of the Universe in his speech.\n\n—Lucretius, *The Nature of Things*, 5.41-55\n \n---\n\n1\\. *black livestock*: Romans offered sacrifices to the Manes, the spirits of their dead ancestors. As a rule, celestial gods received fair or white victims, and spirits and deities of the underworld received black victims. Cf. Virgil, *Aeneid* 6.243-54, where Aeneas sacrifices four black bullocks, a black-fleeced lamb and a barren cow to various infernal power before entering the underworld.\n\n2\\. *Avarice . . . Ambition*: See note 4.\n\n3\\. *Death’s gate*: Lucretius’ metaphor here is made literal and expanded by Virgil in his description of the entrance to Hell:\n\n&gt;Right at the entrance, at the mouth of Hell,\n\n&gt;Grief and vengeful Cares have made their beds,\n\n&gt;There pale Diseases and sad Old Age dwell,\n\n&gt;And Dread, and Hunger who gives bad advice,\n\n&gt;And Ugly Want . . . (*Aeneid* 6.273-6, trans. AES)\n\n**4\\. *Pride . . . Sloth*: D. E. W. Wormell thinks it is no accident that these, along with Avarice and Ambition in 3.59, correspond so closely to the Seven Deadly Sins (a correspondence emphasized in the translation). He suggests that the Church may have absorbed the list from Epicurean teaching (‘The Personal World of Lucretius’, in *Lucretius*, ed. D. R. Dudley (1965)).**\n",

        "text": "I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/29m0q3/senecas_letters_and_epicurus/cimdqrc) in /r/Stoicism a while ago when someone asked about books for Epicureanism. I'll just repost it here (maybe we could make a reading list for the sidebar?):\n\nThe influences of Epicurus spread through much of the writings of other philosophers and major historical figures. Prominent examples include Isaac Newton, Karl Marx, and Thomas Jefferson. In fact, the *pursuit of happiness* part from Jefferson's *Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness* was likely heavily influenced by Epicurus. \n\n##**Essential reading material**\n\n* [*On the Nature of Things*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura) by Lucretius (*c*. 55 BCE). [Here's](http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Things-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447962/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401768176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+nature+of+things) the translation I have. Most of Epicurus' writings have unfortunately not survived. As a result, this remains the best primary resource for those wishing to study Epicureanism.\n\n* The [fragments](http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/fragments.html) of Epicurus (*c*. 270 BCE). Best of all, these are free! I put them together into a PDF [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3wE4P-ZO1-BM0ZkNEt2bkFwQ2s/edit) that you can easily download to view on your computer or print out for a physical copy.\n\n* [Letter to Menoeceus](http://www.philosophicalgarden.com/wp/texts/epicurus/letter-to-menoeceus/) from Epicurus (*c.* 270 BCE). A great introductory text whereby Epicurus essentially summarizes his philosophical teachings.\n\n##**Recommended Reading of Classical Sources**\n\n* [*The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism*](http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Companion-Epicureanism-Companions-Philosophy/dp/0521695309), ed. James Warren (2009). A much more academic text, but extremely well put together and well sourced.\n\n* [*The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius*](http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Companion-Lucretius-Stuart-Gillespie/dp/0521612667/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411236265&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=lucretius), ed. Stuart Gillespie and Philip Hardie (2007).\n\n* [*On the Nature of the Gods*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum) (De Natura Deorum) by Cicero (c. 45 BCE). This one is a dialogue laid out in three books, each of which discuss the theology of different Roman and Greek philosophers. The dialogue uses a discussion of Stoic, Epicurean, and skeptical theories to examine fundamental questions of theology. Cicero is particularly hard on the Epicureans, though he does his best to remain impartial.\n\n* [*On the Ends of Good and Evil*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum) (De finibus bonorum et malorum) by Cicero (c. 45 BCE). Cicero explains the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Platonism of Antiochus of Ascalon.\n\n* [*The Epicurean Inscription*](http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/tei.html) by Diogenes of Oinoanda (c. 200 CE). An Epicurean Greek from the 2nd century AD who carved a summary of the philosophy of Epicurus onto a portico wall in the ancient city of Oenoanda in Lycia (modern day southwest Turkey). The surviving fragments of the wall, which originally extended about 80 meters, form an important source of Epicurean philosophy. The inscription sets out Epicurus' teachings on physics, epistemology, and ethics. It was originally about 25 000 words long and filled 260 square meters of wall space. Less than a third of it has been recovered.\n\n* [*Lives of Eminent Philosophers, book X*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783425.Lives_of_Eminent_Philosophers_Vol_2_Books_6_10?from_search=true) by Diogenes Laërtius (c. 215 CE). A biographer of many great philosophers, including Epicurus.\n\n* [*The Art of Happiness*](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Happiness-Epicurus/dp/0143107216/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404276182&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=epicurus) by Epicurus and others (c. 270 BCE - 2012 CE). This is a collection of Epicurean writings, including Epicurus' fragments. It also includes some of Lucretius' writings from the above work, plus other stuff that you can read in the Amazon description, so keep that in mind when considering buying.\n\n* The [*Protagoras*](http://www.amazon.com/Protagoras-Meno-Penguin-Classics-Plato/dp/0140449035/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406495528&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=protagoras+plato&amp;dpPl=1) dialogue by Plato (*c*. 380 BCE). A discussion on the relationship between pleasure, knowledge, and the good.\n\n* The [*Apology*](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Socrates-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+last+days+of+socrates) dialogue by Plato (c. 399 BCE). Plato's version of the speech given by Socrates as he defended himself in 399 BC against the charges of \"corrupting the young, and by not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other *daimonia* that are novel\" (24b).\n\n* [Odes and Epodes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212998.Odes_and_Epodes?from_search=true) by Horace (23 BCE). The poetry of Horace (born 65 BCE) is richly varied, its focus moving between public and private concerns, urban and rural settings, Stoic and Epicurean thought.\n\n* [*The Essential Epicurus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195762.The_Essential_Epicurus) by Epicurus (1993), trans. Eugene O'Connor—all of Epicurus' fragments (all of which would be in either the fragments link above, or in *The Art of Happiness*).\n\n* [*Epicureanism*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7127818-epicureanism) by Tim O'Keefe (2009). Part of the [Ancient Philosophies series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/61146-ancient-philosophies) of books.\n\n##**Books to Avoid**\n\n* *The Swerve* by Stephen Greenblatt (2011). This book has been oft-criticized as having a Dan Brown-esque reading style. My biggest complaint however would be that it doesn't properly portray Epicureanism in a well researched way. Not only that, the author makes it clear in his writing that he has a problem with mainstream religion (namely Christianity). This directly contradicts with Epicurean teaches, with the philosophical school being more inclined towards accepting the beliefs of others. If you aren't convinced yet, my last complaint is that the writing is very unfocused, constantly shifting between the 15^th century and a rough sketch of Epicurus in ancient Greece.\n\nEdit: Post other recommendations here for others to see! I'll update the list since this is making up the sidebar at present.",
