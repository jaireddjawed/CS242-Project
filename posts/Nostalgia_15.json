        "title": "Can one accept that their childhood had bad things in them while still seeing them as good memories?",
        "author": "godzillavkk",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/11fqq5y/can_one_accept_that_their_childhood_had_bad/",
        "text": "What makes our childhoods such nostalgic times, is the fact that when you were a kid, you didn't need to worry about all the bad stuff that was. The grownups took care of them. Then, when you become a grownup, and suddenly the bad stuff of today is something you have to take care of, it's easy to look back at your childhood and think of that time period as perfect.\n\n80's born see the 80's as the perfect time... while the grownups of the 80's saw the 50's as the perfect time, and so on. But the sad thing is, many never acknowledge the bad that was... or worse think it was good. But it's important to accept that all time periods had their goods and their bad's. And I think learning about all the bad stuff that was is essential for healthy nostalgia. Perhaps we can learn how the bad of old birthed the bad of now, so we can better handle the bad of now.\n\nTake me for example. I was born in 1992, and I still have wonderful memories of the 90's. My families enormous mansion, my neighborhood was second only to Sesame Street, and I loved exploring the enchanted forest not far away. But that's how my memory sees them. Whenever I venture back there, I see an average house, a neighborhood that probably was built via gentrification, and a small park forest. And those are just a few of the great things I remember.\n\nBut I never knew of, the years before 9/11 were marked by the extremely chaotic rearrangement of the former Warsaw Pact nations and the decade after was dominated by the Iraq War and memories of 9/11. Hell, I didn't even know 9/11 happened until I was in high school. The \"technological revolution\" ultimately never  became the boon it was supposed to be: Economically, the exodus of  manufacturing jobs forced the middle class to live on debt, which would give way to an economic meltdown by the end of the 2000s while privacy  would gradually become a major source of concern as personal data became  readily accessible. During the 1990s, the Internet was very expensive  and was the province of businessmen and geeks while during the following decade, online downloads and chatrooms became incendiary topics. Grunge and \"gangsta rap\" were better known at their peak for the demise of several of their stars than for the music while hip-hop and pop-punk would be regarded in retrospective as trashy as the bubblegum pop that dominated the late 90s. By increasingly appealing to the trendy set, TV and film became increasingly shallow. While ideological differences  became a thing of the past, politics became more self-serving and conflicts became pettier. As a result, people began to feel a sense of  disconnection, which eventually led to the rise of strongly ideological populist movements. \n\nHell, my own mother and father barely had time to worry about any of that. They were too busy raising me. But learning about all this bad has given me insight to how to deal with the bad of today. Has it done the same for you?",
