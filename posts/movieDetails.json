The curator, whilst watching Parzival walk away, decides to leave the scene playing as a major clue is about to be revealed. This implies that The curator knows that the aforementioned scene is a major clue to the contest.\n\n[Clip 2] Parzival says to Art3mis that he always felt that the biggest clue to the contest was hidden in the scene they were watching. The curator says: \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, before changing the context of his comment to the bet they made. \nShortly after, Parzival says to Art3mis: \u201cShe [Keira] is the big mystery\u201d. The curator then says: \u201cNo No\u201d. Before then again changing to the aforementioned context. \n\nIt is later revealed that the final secret to the contest was in the scene that Parzival mentioned, and that Halliday\u2019s relationship with Keira is not a clue to the final step, but actually Halliday\u2019s friendship with Morrow (both are relevant in the scene that Parzival is watching). \n\nThis implies that The curator knows that Halliday\u2019s friendship with Morrow is part of the \u2018final clue\u2019, despite the fact that no characters, or the audience, are supposed to know that the \u2018final clue\u2019 exists (there is a secret final test in the movie).\n\nIn clip 2 The curator also insists that Parzival takes his quarter, despite it being negligible to Parzival\u2019s coin count.\n\n[Clip 3] It is revealed that the quarter that The curator gave to Parzival is a token which grants an extra life. \n\nThe fact that The curator insisted that Parzival takes the extra life implies that he believes Parzival will need it, as the next key is found through completing a dangerous challenge (although Parzival did not need it to obtain the second key), unlike the first key (a protected shortcut under the race) and the third key (the third key was only dangerous due to IOI sabotaging the competition, which is not in The curator\u2019s control).\n\n[Bonus theory] At the end of the film, it is revealed that The curator is Morrow, who created the oasis with Halliday, providing an explanation to how The curator knew all the clues to the contest. Despite this, Morrow says to Wade (Parzival\u2019s human identity) that Halliday told Morrow nothing about the contest. This leads me to believe that Halliday did in fact NOT make the contest, and instead Morrow did to honour Halliday after his death, but I understand that this may just be a plot hole rather than a detail.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1670014060.0},{"title":"In Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), Wakanda's goddess, Bast and Talokan's god, K'uk'ulkan are both sitting in front of Thor and friends","author":"CORVlN","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/wlvlppqwgf3a1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669962026.0},{"title":"In The Three Stooges short \"Hold The Lion\" (1947) Curly makes a cameo, with a full head of hair.
