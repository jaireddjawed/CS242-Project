Assuming also that city has no income tax, how could it be made clear that the high rise would be beneficial tax-wise for the city versus the single family home?",

However, it seems like the conversation has many more voices compared to a few years ago when it was mostly policy wonks listening to Strong Towns.  \n\nIn your experiences (I guess this is more tailored to North Americans), is walkability/anti-sprawl becoming a large topic in the public consciousness? Can increasing awareness lead to collective pressure on policymakers to implement better ideas? Or are younger generations going to continue defaulting to SF housing due to a lack of affordable alternatives or ingrained cultural preferences?",

        "text": "In pretty much every American city the very center/downtown of the city at the very least has a mature grid pattern. Generally lots along these street networks are easy to develop and it is easy to grow the grid system in a comprehensive and navigable manner\n\nUnfortunately many cities that experience growth patterns post WW2 tended to not use Euclidean street network design in lieu of street grids. These are generally more circuitous to navigate and are more difficult to adapt for good bus service\n\nOne example I have in mind the Seattle areas light rail expansion opening 2024-2025 which will open light rail stations in suburban areas such as Lynwood. King county metro is planning a bus network redesign to respond to this so buses can be readily fed to the light rail stations, in theory hopefully making the reach of these light rail station more expansive to those who don’t live in walking distance but do live near a bus stop. \n\nThe issue that this bus redesign has come up against us that there aren’t very many roads that are up to par for bus connectivity the further north from Seattle you venture. East - West bus travel is particularly difficult due to the lack of contiguous roads that travel the full length East -West in the Seattle area. Working within the confines of how the road network exists today means that there are generally only a few high quality heavily trafficked arterials that can possibly work for contiguous bus service\n\nHow should an area such as this approach their problems so that they can help ensure better future connectivity for all modes but especially for buses?",

Quite a few of them already were before the pandemic but the WAH movement has exacerbated this by emptying many downtown office buildings of a majority of their office workers. I have hoped and read a decent bit about how the positive of this is that many large buildings could be converted into mixed use/residential which could bring more people to actually live downtown instead of just working there. But there has also been discussion about how difficult it is to convert these buildings and how some are basically lost causes. \n\nIt got me thinking that perhaps the true silver lining is in all this is that at some point these cities might finally give up trying so hard to make their downtown areas accommodating to commuting suburbanites and instead make them nice walkable places to actually live and work.\n\nWhat do you think is the future of the downtowns of North American cities?",

        "text": "Hi there, r/urbanplanning. This is something I've been thinking about lately, and I wanted to put it y'all.\n\nAs a teacher of language, I've often been impressed by how having the correct vocabulary for things can change how we think. One of my favorite examples is the Japanese adjective \"bimyo,\" which means something like \"neither good nor bad, but in not being good, is bad.\" When living in Japan, this word became a regular staple of the English speaker's vocabulary because of sheer number of things it applies to. \n\nThe invention of the word \"stroad\" and the redefinition of \"street\" and \"road\" by Chuck Marohn has had a similar effect.\n\nI've noticed a similar problem a lot in discussions of density and city form. Super-low density gets the word \"rural,\" single family detached sprawl gets the word \"suburban,\" but middle-density, high-density, and super-high density are generally all rolled into \"urban,\" even though the difference between mixed-use four-story buildings and skyscrapers is massive. (For the record, I'm aware that mid-density areas were historically considered suburban, but the language has shifted completely.)\n\nFor this reason, I'm proposing the following breakdown of \"urban\" into three categories based on the average size of buildings in the area:\n\n* **Semi-urban:** average 3-5 floors\n* **Urban**: 6-10 floors\n* **Superurban:** 11+ floors\n\nWhile these terms are not precise (vocabulary for talking with a non-professional audience rarely are), I think they go a long way to give us tools for distinguishing between wanting to build a mixed use \"semi-urban\" core and building \"superurban\" highrises.\n\nI'm not a planner or a professional in this space, so I'd love to hear your thoughts!",

        "text": "Hello, there has been some upset and disagreement in my City (Oshawa) around increasing traffic and a shift to Jets at the City Airport. I am not directly affected and do not have a strong stance, so was looking for some Redditors to brainwash me into having one. \n\nFor context, Oshawa is a historically independent city which has been eaten by Toronto (the GTA) and now constitutes the Eastern Shoulder, with the Pickering being a city between the two which has developed as an Edge city of Toronto. The Oshawa airport is historically a training airport with prop planes, while Pickering is arguably slated to have a larger airport in the rural north to serve as overflow for Toronto's main airport. \n\nI think Pickering is the better location. It's directly along the alignment for the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal High Frequency train alignment, making it ideal for flighers to connect to Toronto or locals to train to Montreal instead of fly. It's also near the 407 highway, allowing easy highway access. Conversly, Oshawa's airport is in a suburban area, making it more difficult to access, and the runway approach may restrict the development of high rise buildings on Simcoe street, the North-South main street which included a university in the north, the Hospital, and the Downtown. The airport itself is a money losing institution, though the plan is to have the executive jet market decrease losses. \n\nHow do urbanists feel about this? Is there a reason to protect and grow the airport? Is being against the expansion really NIMBY? Should locals suck it up and deal with the noise since they moved near a smaller airport (even though a few farmers seem to have complained enough to end development on the Pickering option)?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Oshawa/comments/119gij5/transport_canada_responds_to_noise_complaints_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

I realized soon into my school career I wanted to go into something relating to the environment. I was unable to switch my major due to financial and time reasons but decided I would take the work route. I've been working in conservation and trail building and I recently got a job in a leadership position in Parks and Recreation. While doing these jobs in Conservation, I've become more interested in Town Planning and creating communities that as opposed to being separated from nature become one. \n\nWell, I was recently rejected from an Urban Planning Master's program in Europe. I'm looking to apply again this Fall for either the same or a different program. I want to spend this year building my resume more for an Urban Planning program, I am doing passion projects like trying to create a Zine about it every month, and creating plans for eco housing and redesigning busy streets. My one fall back is I'm doing all of this by hand since I don't know what programs to use to design. What would you recommend for a beginner who has no experience?\n\nAlso what are my best chances for getting my foot in the career without an undergrad degree and still waiting to get into a Master's program. Will internships take me despite the fact I don't have the Bachelor's and if so what companies would do that? \n\nThank you for your time if you read and respond to this.",
