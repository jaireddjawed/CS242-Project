        "text": "Recently a couple of university students reached out to me for help with their class project.  They are in a class that's focused on my area of expertise, and their professor had pointed them in my direction since I'm a known entity.  This is the first time I've served in this role.  I enjoyed it, for the most part.\n\nBut I had to take the reins in getting our meeting set up.  After I agreed to a meeting, I had to prompt them for their availability so that I could find a date that suited my schedule.  And then the day before our meeting, I realized the students hadn't provided a call-in number or Zoom link or anything. So I set those things up for us.\n\nIt was not a big hardship on my part, and I totally get that they are newbies to the whole \"professional conduct\" thing, not being professionals yet.  But it's got me thinking how important following respectful protocol is to making a good impression.\n\nIf you're asking someone to take time out of their schedule to provide you with information, especially info pertaining to a potential career path, it really is on you to handle the meeting logistics.   Once a point of contact agrees to a meeting, send them a set of dates and times (at least over the following work week, but two would be ideal) that works with your schedule and have them pick from those dates/times.  Then send them a calendar invite with the call-in number or virtual link. \n\nYour point of contact shouldn't have to do these tasks, as piddly as they are.  They are not the one benefiting from the meeting.  They are doing *you* a favor.  The least you can do is take care of the scheduling.  Nowadays, people are so busy (or lazy, depending on how you look at it) that if a meeting isn't automatically scheduled on their calendar, they will forget about it.  \n\nAlso, if you're doing an informational interview, whether it is for school or just professional development, send the interviewee your questions in advance.  I had no idea what these students were going to ask me, so I didn't know what I needed to do to prepare.  I might have given them better information if I had known what they were going to ask me in advance.",

This obviously comes in very handy on the nights you don't feel like cooking, but can become problematic when you are unable to identify the contents of a container. Sometimes it's important to know the difference between chilli and Bolognese sauce so you know if you need to cook up some rice or pasta. \n\nNow label makers are like printers. The label maker itself is normally low cost but the cartridges are ridiculously expensive. If you do your research though you can find off-brand cartridges for a fraction of the cost. \n\nLabelling the food in your house gives you greater visibility of what you have and how long you've had it for. Since I started labelling my food I've reduced the food waste in my home and been able to plan my meals and shopping much easier.",

        "text": "Meetings. Everybody hates them. They interrupt your day. They take forever. And, most of all, there are too freaking many of them. So here's how to make the most of meetings, not to mention make them shorter and more effective. \n\n1. Have an agenda. It's someone else calling the meeting, ask what's going to be covered and what needs to be accomplishment. And then do your best to keep it on that set of topics. \n2. Unless it's strategic in nature, no meeting should take more than an hour. In fact, most should take no more than thirty minutes. Think of it this way. Next time you're in a meeting, count heads and multiply how many productive hours are being siphoned up by this meeting. And then decide if it's worth it. \n3. Only involve the people in the meeting who need to be there. If there are people who only need to be there for part of the meeting, arrange the agenda so that they can cut out when their business is complete. \n4. If there are several people in a meeting and two people are discussing a topic that involves no one else, take that discussion off-line. \n5. Meetings require preparation, no matter how trivial. Read up on the agenda. Review notes on project statuses. Think ahead of time about what's going to be discussed. Fifteen minutes of thought before a meeting can make a huge difference in how effective your presence is in that meeting. \n6. Everything that gets discussed should have an action item, a due date for said item, and someone entrusted to carry it out. Someone should be tasked with documenting the meeting outcome.\n7. Don't pipe up unless you actually have something to contribute. Way too many people talk at length in meetings for no other reason than they feel they need to. And if you say the dreaded words, \"One more thing...\" at the end of the meeting after all the agenda has been covered, you will be secretly hated by everyone else in the room. \n8. Schedule meetings early or late. Otherwise, you're disrupting the flow of the workday. There is absolutely nothing that destroys productivity more than several half-hour meeting scattered through the day. \n9. Can this meeting be an e-mail? Then it should be an e-mail.",

Check the nutritional information after a week. If you see less than 1,000mg of daily Potassium consumption, let alone less than 500mg, you might be deficient. Add 2,000mg, through banana, potato, or \"healthy\" soups.\n\nIf you can make the time, do pull-ups. 3-5 sets, 2-3 times a week. Treat it casually. If you can't make a given set, or just don't feel like it that day, skip it. But try to make it for at least 1 day a week.\n\nThere's a very solid chance your upper back is weak and cramping while you sleep.",

These people will always give a hard \"yes I want you to come to the thing\" unless they really don't want someone to actually accept.\n\nFor the other people, saying \"if you want to\" is the polite thing to do because \"you should come\" is rude and makes the other person feel obligated to join even if they don't want to. These people wont give a hard \"yes I want you to come to the thing\" in almost all situations because that's what they see as polite. \n\nSo you can imagine if someone of the second type is always trying to invite someone of the first type to things and always getting told no, it can drive a wedge between them when its really just a cultural difference.",
