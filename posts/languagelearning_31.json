I am new to language learning and I am currently learning Spanish so I can talk to the locals around me. I am mostly watching a lot of Dreaming Spanish and Spanish after hours so I can get as much comprehensible input as possible. While I do that, I also do the vocab flash cards on the Spanish dictionary app and I also have a Spanish friend that I meet with every Monday to “cross-talk”, where she speaks Spanish to me and I respond with my native language. I sometimes incorporate Duolingo when I have time. Do you think this is an effective way to learn and is there anything I am missing from my routine? I am trying to reach conversational Spanish by the fall, however I’m not sure if that is doable considering I don’t know how long it takes to learn a language.",

        "text": "There could be many reasons why you are struggling to string up a basic sentence even after months or years of making streaks, collecting points or buying premium apps. It can be a lack of discipline, it can be thinking that you can learn a language in 3 minutes of unfocused dealing with the app just to get it of your daily todo list, it can be using too many resources and wasting time relearning the same topics in each of them from scratch, but nothing ruins your progress and gives you false hope as much as a problem of which most people aren't aware - passive learning.\n\nSo what is passive learning? Here's a simple example of a word that many people know:\n\n1. How do you say \"house\" in Spanish?\n2. What does Casa in Mi casa es su casa mean?\n\nDo you notice the difference?\n\nFor the first question you had to actively think and try to recall the word on your own like you would in a real conversation, while in the second one you almost completely didn't need to think at all, but just had to passively recognize the word, which was additionally helped with the context of a well known phrase.\n\nThis is because passive learning is the first step to learning a word (or any other type of information, like that person's name who you keep forgeting) and the second step is knowing it actively and being able to use it yourself, but for words to be activated, you need to either be constantly surrounded by them (contextual input, though shows, books,etc.) or to practice the hell out of them.\n\nYou can learn hundreds or even thousands of words passively and recognize them once they are shown to you, you can score the highest points in apps by recognizing them, however until you learn them actively as well, you will struggle to remember them on your own and will continue mumbling when trying to string up a basic sentence. This is why there's so many youtubeglots who have catchy titles about how they learned x thousand words in a month (which technically is the truth), but once they start to speak, things don't look so great anymore and they sound like they barely know 10 words.\n\nSo if learning to recognize words (passive learning) is the problem and we instead need to learn how to produce/output those words on our own (active recall) like we would in a real conversation, then how do we do that? Well...exactly like that, like we would in the real life.\n\nWe shouldn't learn the words in their \"pre-translated\" form in the foreign language, but we should learn to translate them ourselves from our own language. Instead of reading that casa means house, we should ask ourselves what is the house called in Spanish and try to think about it.\n\nIt might seem simple, but it is what got me to learn anywhere from 30 to 50 words a day and remember them actively after only a few days of SRS reviews, regardless of how hard or rare they are.\n\nActive recall is a process in which you try to remember the piece of information before being presented with it and doing that makes the brain remember better, whether it's languages, some subject in school or anything else, so if this is a well known and proven scientific fact, why would you derail yourself into using less effective passive learning methods pushed by most apps?\n\nIf you learn how to translate a native word into your target language, you will also learn to recognize it back, so you will get the same effect as you would with passive learning, but at the same time you will learn the word actively and be able to use it in sentences after only a few days of SRS based reviews.\n\nIf you are still strugling, then you are either not trying to remember the word or you need a new/different sentence to learn the word from. Which is another important thing, if you struggle with a word, relearning it over and over using the same sentence won't help, but having (several) different ones will.\n\nSame thing can be applied for grammar learning or literally any other subject or field of knowledge other than languages.",

        "text": "**TLDR: I did a Vietnamese language immersion course in Vietnam and spent a month in France practicing French and would like to share what I learned/give advice to anyone else interested in doing immersions to help with planning.**\n\nAs a fellow avid language learner, and after many years of trying to learn on my own cheaply (but obviously giving up and finally putting money towards my goals), I was able to do a 4-week language learning immersion course + 1 week travel in Vietnam (HCMC) and spent 4.5 weeks in France with my partner's family practicing French. I learned a lot from both experiences and would be happy to share advice with anyone looking to do something similar so you might get the most out of it too.\n\nRelevant background and summary of experiences:\n\nI am a native English speaker.\n\n\\- **VIETNAM**: **insecure A1 to solid A2** after my experience (100 class hours). I am a heritage speaker but stopped using it regularly past the age of 7, so my pronunciation is basically native and I have good instincts/foundation about grammar and vocab, but I had very little confidence in speaking because of lack of use and because I never learned it formally.\n\nMy in-country experience was **6 hours a day one-on-one tutoring, stayed with a homestay family**, never studied because my host family wanted to hang out with me all the time so I got lots of listening and speaking practice but honestly did not effectively learn more vocab (my biggest weakness). Lessons were easy for me because a lot of it was review, and I had no issues with reading or pronunciation, so it was mostly a vocab exercise and getting me back to being used to speaking the language and gaining confidence in using it. By the end, I was quite comfortable traveling around for a week and was able to communicate with hotel staff, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, etc. for essentials with little to no trouble.\n\nMy biggest lesson from this: I think being a B1/B2 level would have been better for an immersion program, because at A level, my time would have been better spent in the classroom drilling vocab. Due to lack of vocab, the conversations I had with my host family were very limited and it was very hard to actually learn anything just by speaking/listening. It would have been better to already know the words but now use them in context.\n\n**So if I could do this again,** I would wait until I was a B1/B2 level, and also try to really carve out time to study.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **FRANCE: shaky B1 to....shaky B1** XD. **I went to stay with my partner's family in France for 4.5 weeks** over the winter holidays, and his family and many friends don't speak English well enough to have a real conversation, so I got quite a bit of French speaking and listening practice.\n\nI had been learning online (Lingoda) for the previous year, having put in 260 hours and taking the B1 level classes before I went. After my experience, my best takeaways were basically just proving that I was able to spontaneously have conversations with native speakers (with plenty of accommodation and understanding on their part, which I am very grateful) and that all my studying was worth something. My main points of learning were learning words/phrases I already knew but in context/in a real-life way, and realizing that being in a real French environment was a far cry from having your French teacher's clear, simplified words piped directly into your ears via headphones. Also, being B1 level helped a LOT because I was able to have actual conversations and make connections with people, which I felt I couldn't really do in Vietnam. Bonuses: I also read my first book in French while I was there, and had my first experience speaking to shopkeepers.\n\nHowever, because this was also a personal trip for us, I really struggled with the feeling of not wanting to be in the way of people catching up, not wanting non-teachers to have to accommodate to me, not wanting to burden the trip in any way, etc. so I was often stressed and shy and did not end up speaking as much as I could have. This might have been mostly in my head, but for the sake of language learning, it would have been better to be in an environment where everyone I'm talking to knows I'm a learner and can accommodate and encourage me.\n\n**So if I could do this again,** I would prefer to take a proper course with a school so learning can be a focus of my trip, but try to integrate socializing with normal French people.",

If I buy an English translated version, I can more properly enjoy a material but I lose the language exposure. This isn't an issue with tv shows because I can understand a good chunk of spoken language and it takes 24 minutes to watch an anime episode whether I watch it unsubbed, with subs, or English dub. But it's a big dilemma for something that requires a lot of reading and mental energy like books and games. What probably isn't helping either is the use of a lot of Japanese at work whether it's in meetings, technical documents, etc. and I believe this is contributing to fatigue in the language.

I've been speaking this language on and off for about 6 years now, but my studies have been so sporadic that there's a lot I've needed to work on over time.  As a result, 6 years feels... too long for someone of my ability. I was talking with people and screwed up really poorly, and someone remarked about my ability in a way that natives of the language interpreted as fairly insulting after telling them about it.\n\nHonestly, this whole thing has really shattered my confidence and made it hard for me to speak with people outside of my closer circle, since I already have confidence issues. what are some ways I can bounce back from this pretty poor interaction?",

And I was super excited to be learning the language for two years, but in the third year, it just feels like a waste of my time!\n\nI’ve been in Spanish for three years, but the system has changed how exams and competence tests work so that my brain just never retains any information. It doesn’t need to. The setup of the class ensures I will never use “caerse” again. And even if my classes had been helping me retain the information, they won’t let us use it! Just today we sang “De Colores” like we were children, and any time we have for actual conversations, our ability is almost nonexistent. No matter which partners we’re assigned too, nobody can speak at a level beyond your average three year old. (Como se dice… everything?)\n\nIt’s just very frustrating, because I want travel and languages to be a part of who I am; I think they’re very valuable and I want to travel a lot. But between the failure of classes and the failure of websites like Duolingo or Babble, it just makes me want to turn my class into just another thing to get an A in, not a life skill.",

I’ll start with a few (not all) that I know, and I’d like to hear how speakers in your languages tease each other.\n\n- Plenty of English speakers insist that the Australian accent is next to impossible to understand. Comedian Trevor Noah (from South Africa) once joked that nobody can tell the difference between Chinese and a very thick Australian accent.\n\n- Speaking of Chinese, the different accents in Mandarin get ribbed for how they sound. People from Beijing are accused of over-curling their tongues, since they seem to put 儿 (ěr) at the end of everything. Meanwhile, there is a joke that Taiwanese Mandarin is just “start every sentence with 啊 (ah) and end every sentence with 那 (nah).”\n\n- I don’t know any specific teases, but Swedish speakers absolutely love poking fun of each other’s accents. I know that Skånska is often the one that seems to get laughed at the hardest because of its Danish influence.\n\n- I can’t say this is reflective of all Spanish speakers, but I’ve met my fair share of Latin Americans who say they cannot stand the lisp that dominates speakers from Spain. Meanwhile, at least one Spaniard I’ve met once said that if all Latin Americans insist on pronouncing their c, s, and z the same way, they should just use one of those letters and forget the other two.\n\n- One French speaker once told me that “media from Quebec is subtitled in France because we don’t understand a damn thing they’re saying.”\n\nI look forward to reading your answers.",

        "text": "So... Maybe you should not tell anyone about the fact itself, be stupid and pretend you don't do anything, you do not learn, study or acquire a language. Why would I do something so stupid you may ask, well... It is pretty smart actually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe truth behind it has science evidence and rational logical statements - let's start. \n\n1. You have an idea, you want to learn something, or create or maybe do something - start running, having good sleep recall, or study better at school and finally learning a language. You will be thinking that you're pretty smart than others, so you would start telling people about your goal, for example becoming fluent in Uzbek. There is gonna be a lot of reactions to this fact, let's assume that all of the people will say that this is a great idea! You will become smarter, you would be able to travel to Uzbekistan and speak with people on their native language, only benefits. However your brain will release dopamine - a hormone in our brain that gives us pleasure for a thing that you haven't accomplished yet, it still means that you will feel pleasure, there is only one problem - brain will also think that you already accomplished it because 1) People already praised you. 2) Brain already gave you pleasure, so you should relax and be proud of yourself. \n\nThe idea with this science maybe wrong, maybe it's complete bullshit because I've only heard about it from on youtuber, however I trust him because he always say to us that we should check up information on our own and trust no one till we proof that it was true - you can do it, be sceptical.\n\n2. \n\nThe second problem is motivation will quickly fade away - I don't mean that you will become bored soon, I mean there is gonna be people who will say that Uzbek is useless language, not a lot of people knows it, there are not a lot of information on it, you should learn Chinese, Japanese, Russian, English, French, etc. At the beginning you think that they are wrong, I know better than they and you will continue, but this time with a mindset one against entire world, since no one believes that this is a worthy language. \n\n3. Expectations\n\nDo not underestimate this part - when people know that you learn a language, they will have expectations on you, even if they didn't want to have it, they created them automatically. Sometimes people will ask you about your progress, maybe saying good job or realizing that you're too slow, stupid, do not do it correctly, here is another way and another. You'll be pretty disappointed once again and it will only get worse with your motivation. \n\nAlso if you decided to quit the language, you would simply be afraid to tell them since you quitted. \n\n4. In the end you will have a lot of pleasure from people who praised you and a lot of hate because they think that this language is useless for you or other reasons. You will quickly forget about the language, since all the motivation disappeared and you're miserable know. \n\n5. Salvation.\n\nThere is a way how to quickly get up while being pretty much motivated on a normal level without accomplishing anything just yet - simply get ready, understand that it will take some time, since we're sceptical, we're not gonna say that it will take me nor 1 month or 1 year or 10 years, just see how it goes. And of course do not tell anyone, the pros is exactly the opposite to previous steps - since no one knows what the heck are you doing, no one will give you hints or advices or things to do better than learning your language. If before people praised you, know there is gonna be silence. If they said that it's a useless language, now they will say nothing. And motivation will only depend on you and with things that you consume - it can go low or high sometimes, still it'll be on almost the same level all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s You might be thinking, why would I write the article, If I made a post where I literally confessed that I learn a language, basically I wanted to share an idea that I found from one guy on YouTube, I was just sceptical about it and wanted to see people's opinion - some people agree, some people don't, that is okay. Anyway I could say my motivation is not lost really, since no one really knows what my TL. I'll give you some hints - It is not Russian or English, maybe Uzbek? :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven If you give me a correct answer, I wouldn't really answer anyway until I get some good results, like b1-b2 level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;DR - Do not tell anyone which language you learn, do not even tell the fact that you learn a language, keep it a secret till you will have some good progress.",

I've greatly improved over the last two years, and would say I'm in an early intermediate stage. I can have a fairly fluid conversation with a native about normal topics with only minor amounts of vocabulary holes/syntax difficulties.\n\nWhen I was younger, I tried really hard to learn Spanish and loved it. I was one of the best students in my school and loved learning spanish. However, I was never able to understand or speak in real life. This was because I only spoke/listened in class, but at the time I simply bought into the monolingual idea that I could never do it because I didn't learn it as a kid.\n\nNow that I know I can learn another language, I'd like to re-learn Spanish as a third language. However, I don't want to lose my progress in Ukrainian, which is my primary TL. So I figured I'd ask y'all what your experience has been. What level were you in your TL when you took on another TL? How did you know you were ready?\n\nThanks!",

I recently started using dreamingspanish as well watching 15-30 minutes worth of content per day, coupled with doing a 30 minutes pimsleur lesson, or just doing 10-30 minutes worth of flash cards in the app. I also bought Madrigal's Magic key to spanish and suppliment in chapters of that book when I don't feel like doing the other two, as well as reading short stories in Spanish. I feel like my method is a little all over the place and would like to try and formalize it a little more.\n\nI want to stick with watching 30 minutes of spanish videos every day. That is a easy thing for me to do and I feel like it has helped my comprehension a lot as well as picking up some new vocabular. I am about to finish Level 2 of pimsleur and after that I wanted to start using italki shooting for a 1 hour session per week. I'm not sure how to fit reading in, if I should be doing it every day or not. I have really just been trying to spend at a minimum 40 minutes to an hour a day taking in spanish content. Do I have a pretty well rounded routine? Should I be adjusting how my time is spent?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

I am trying to study a little of each every day. On days where I have more free time I also practice my two other languages that I am learning (French B2, Yiddish beginner).\n\nAs expected, I've got some \"mixing\" going on which is causing a lot of tip-of-the-tongue moments.

I also studied throughout high school and took 2-3 classes in college (I tested into a 3000-level advanced grammar + writing course for example).\n\nI am at a point where I need to round out my high listening comprehension skills with speaking, reading, and writing skills for work / community-building. Starting ‘at the beginning’ would be much too basic for me. I need to pinpoint certain grammar skills and fill in (many) gaps in my knowledge of vocabulary, idioms, and other turns of phrase.\n\nI have tried Duolingo and found it unhelpful, McGraw Hill’s Advanced Grammar (too advanced), and one on one lessons, which were expensive and not as challenging or fast-paced as I had hoped. At the same time, I never developed study skills that worked well for language learning. I feel I don’t know how to teach myself or devise a curriculum for myself. It’s frustrating, as my comprehension is very high but I struggle to form sentences most of the time. My vocabulary feels quite limited. I get nervous even for casual interactions at the store. However, I have also had a handful of conversations in Spanish that were lengthy and went very smoothly when solo traveling… no idea how I was able to pull off those conversations.\n\nI am at a loss as to where to find the best or most appropriate resources for my situation. My employer may be willing to support financially, but I’m not sure what to ask for. I work in the arts / nonprofit, so think general outreach and one on one support re: artist opportunities.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "tl; dr - when it comes to content consumption to learn a langauge, what are your thoughts? Articles? Youtube? What about Tiktok or Instagram?\n\nMy friend and I have been building an app that makes it easy to look up words while you are reading articles or watching Youtubes video. Both of us have learned multiple languages over the course of our lifetime, so we have a slightly different learning approaches and goals. \n\nMe: native Korean, but lived abroad most of my life since highschool.  I currently live in the US, and although I don't need to actively learn English, I know if I don't use it for a while, my English just sounds awful (maybe it's in my head, but I can feel it) Like most good Asian kids, I read articles (major news outlets) and books to study, and when I find a new word (or words that I sort of know but can't really use), I want to turn them into a vocab notebook and a flashcard (but usually I am too lazy to make one, so they just live in some notebooks). All other languages that I learned (Spanish, Italian and Japanese) are through classes so for me I think of \"learning language = serious business\".\n\nHim: American, but lived in Japan for a really long time so he's fluent in Japanese. He also speaks casual German (his family) and Portuguese (for fun) but I don't think he took any formal course or anything. For him, he likes the dopamine hits when he finds new words and learns interesting facts, so the activity being fun and spontaneous is pretty important to him.\n\nNow, coming back to the original question - he wanted to support Tiktok and Instagram as part of the app, and I told him I don't think that would be a useful feature. Sadly we don't have a big user base yet, so we couldn't talk to the users directly... so here I am asking y'all :D (Also, is it kosher to get feedback on apps that you are making? iano) When it comes to content consumption to learn a langauge, what are your thoughts? Articles/books? Youtube? What about Tiktok or Instagram?",
