        "text": "Supps are often criticised for a variety of reasons. However, most of these dont seem to hold water. Lets take a look at the most common rebukes.\n\n1) Lack of Cofactors\n\nThe argument goes that many multivitamins lack the necessary cofactors to work in an optimal fashion. For example, vitamin C in citrus fruits pair well with bioflavonoids and phytonutrients, whereas a supplement might contain only vanilla Vitamin C, thereby limiting its effectiveness.\n\nHowever, what if we were to take multivites with a well balanced meal (plenty of greens/lean protein etc) Doesnt this largely negate the issue, since these foods would likely contain the necessary cofactors multivites need?\n\n2) Nutrients in Isolation\n\nSupplementing a single type of vitamin have been shown to cause issues. Beta carotent was alleged to increase lung cancer risk in smokers substantially, for instance. \n\nHowever, nutrition consists of a chorus, rather than a single note. Would the variety present in a good Multivitamin not address this issue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Misleading/ False Labels\n\nCorporate lackeys like Orrin Hatch, with the disastrous DSHEA Act of 1994, have meant that the FDA has rather limited oversight of supplement products. This meant that some supplements under/overdose, while others straight up dont contain what they purport to.\n\nHowever, to my knowledge, this is a phenomenon more common with regards to herbal supps, like ashwaganda or gingko biloba etc rather than vitamin supps. Even if we assume US based supps to be lousy across the board, wouldnt vitamin complexes from other countries with better regulation (the EU for instance) solve the issue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance! Hoping to spark some discussion about this issue.",

Most of the animal based / carnivore community argue that fiber is a lie and that we don’t need vegetables since they’re man made and full of anti-nutrients which are bad ?? On the other hand a lot of keto advocates or any other person for that matter encourages vegetable consumption and fruit restriction whereas some carnivores incorporated fruits back , honestly i am lost in this sea of contradicting info and i just want to know which side has the most proof , science backed research that proves strongly their points . What do you think",

There's only 3% of hazelnuts anyway. The sugar content, however, is at 5.5%. So I'm not knowledgeable in this area, but am interested in discovering more about it.\n\nThis also goes to show the importance of all the processes that the ingredients go through (drying, boiling, grinding, mixing...), compared to merely considering ingredient lists alone. Those processes are neglected by the law, which mandates ingredients only to be disclosed.",
