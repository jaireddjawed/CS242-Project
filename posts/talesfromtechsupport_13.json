        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm one of those people that you people describe with \"Knows just enough to be dangerous\" so I'm sorry for any confusion.  \n\n\nActors:  \n$Me = Me  \n$PO= PC-Owner  \n$AB= Admin-Bunny, while not a nickname that stuck, you'll see why I chose it, he's my best friend...and the unlucky soul I call when I run into problems.  \n\n\nTale One:A young friend of mine had trouble with her PC.  \nAs I was sitting around at her place anyway, I offered to take a look.She told me it was slow as hell and refused to play music, so I started the machine.  \nImmediately I learned what she meant with \"slow\". It took a solid 15minutes to boot.  \nIn the meantime I learned that some well meaning friend hat frankensteined the thing out of parts that, at least some of them, might be older than the girl.  \nIt had floppy-disk-drive for hells sake! So, after spending some time allowing Win10 to update I tried to figure out the sound issue.  \nWindows helpfully pointed out that there was no Audio Hardware, which seemed fishy, as the machine had played music before Win10 came along.  \nOff I go to find some drivers. Automatic updates insist there isn't anything to update, and I can't find anything that looks sound related in the hardware that has a model number or makers name.  \nFrustrated I write to $AB about the issue.  \nHe calls back in minutes and requests remote access.  \n\n\n$Po is currently not in the room, so knows neither of the call, nor the remote access.  \n$PO comes in, sees her PC click and scroll through various menus while my hands are off of everything.  \n\n\n$PO \"Uhhh, what is it doing?\" To her credit, she didn't sound overly concerned.  \nI turn around, look her in the eyes with as serious face as I can manage and tell her \"Your PC seems to be posessed, please get some holy water.\"  \n\n\nAbout this time $AB the PC-Demon opens up a youtube tab I had left open and types \"Does it work now?\" thoroughly ruining my mediocre acting, so I had to explain the remote access.  \n\n\nI try and type \"Nope, give me a moment\" and slide under the desk to try and fiddle with the audio ports.  \n\n\n$PO \"You did turn up the volume, right?\"  \n$Me \"Uhhh, sure?\"She turns up the volume from zero and we get sound.  \n\n\n$AB saves the day and gets a thank-you note.  \n(and yes, for previous tests I had turned on the speakers, it was a driver problem)  \n\n\nTale 2: AB-Origins  \n\n\n$AB at the time is a design student who also doubles as tech support for the department at his University.  \n\n\nHe calls me and is rather annoyed about his fellow students.  \nTo make it short: They had a Mac that wouldn't start, despite the hardware being okay.   \nAnnoyingly, this Mac was the one all students in his design department would use to present their work on various projects. This, as the ever competent AB found out, was also the problem, as dozens of students a day would just drag and drop rather big presentations on the desktop, which Macs notoriously dislike.  \n\n\nSo he went through the whole process of wiping all drives and setting up this mac again.  \nThen he spent some time obsessing over fonts and made a tastefull desktop-Background that explained why dropping things on the desktop was bad.  \nNot even 24hours later, the desktop was so full of stuff you could barely see his warning. I told him \"Give me a minute\" pulled a meme template of the time from the internet, fought with the urge to use comic-sans for a moment and finally send him an image with instructions to put it as the new desktop background.  \n\n\nThe image was of a fluffy white rabbit, covering his face with his little paws and the text:\"If you save to the desktop, you make Admin-Bunny cry!\"  \n\n\nI'm proud to report that this not only solved the issue, the image became the standart background for the macs of the department and the logo for the department-Facebook-group.  \n\n\nLesson learned: \"When dealing with users, consider some social engineering\"  \n\n\nEdit: Why did it have this hellish formatting?",

        "text": "I love this sub and have been getting a kick out of some amazing/fun/shocking/brain numbing dumb stories haha. So thank you all for sharing your experiences! I've even learned a thing or 2 from a couple.\n\nThis next one of mine comes from my days of my IT Traineeship. I was 20 and the $company that hired me was a small training outfit for tradesman. I was hired by the $HIT as his sidekick to support the students and staff. He trained me up over a few years but truthfully I have self taught myself more with the ancient style of Google-Fu.\n\nLike most companies of that size with a heavy \"tradesman culture\" the IT guys are only seen as 2 things. Dark Wizards... or useless nerds getting away with doing nothing because \"nothing ever breaks\" and we are only do basic \"on/off support\". Obviously untrue as they never see or understood the setup behind the scenes.\n\nAnyway, the Owner of this place known as $CreepoOwner was a piece of work. Slimy, yet friendly. Happy yet screaming in your face. It was unsettling trying to figure out his mood any given day so you could navigate yourself out of the firing line. The relationship between $HIT and $CreepoOwner was always strained. $CreepoOwner didn't like $HIT or $Me but he knew he needed us. He would always pull us up on stupid things that i wont go into but it caused $HIT to be very secretive with the infrastructure. Its understandable why, due to the HUGE turnover rate. He protected our knowledge so we were un-fireable. That only lasted so long but that's another story. One of the main things $HIT hid was the Admin passwords to the VMs/servers/firewalls etc etc. \n\nAs the underling I would always be put in the middle between both the $CreepoOwner's and $HIT's authority. I was not allowed under any circumstances to share the Admin passwords with $CreepoOwner on pain of unemployment. Also not complying with $CreepoOwner ' requests had a similar outcome with more yelling. It was a recipe for disaster that was incredibly unfair on me but whatever. \n\nSorry for the massive setup, but I like to give context and a setting.\n\nOne summer evening after work...\n\nMe = $Me\n\nHead of IT (my boss) = $HIT\n\nCreepoOwner = $Owner\n\n$Owner \\[Calls my Personal Mobile Afterhours\\]: $Me, whats the Admin password to my F\\*\\*\\*ing laptop.\n\n$Me: uhhhh hi $Owner, whats the problem with your normal login?\n\n$Owner: One of you idiots locked me out! Now get me back in right now!\n\n$Me: Sorry, we wouldnt have done that but i'll see if i can get your account working again.\n\n$Owner: No give me the Admin login now!\n\n(all company devices have an Admin login for us to access to change things. We gave limited acces to everyone due to many issues in the past)\n\n$Me: ummm sorry, but I'm not allowed to give you that password.\n\n(all hell breaks loose)\n\n$Owner: ARE YOU F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\* SERIOUS???!?!? I AM THE F\\*\\*\\*\\* OWNER OF THIS F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* BUSINESS. GIVE ME THAT F\\*\\*\\*\\* PASSWORD RIGHT F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* NOW OR YOU ARE DONE. YOU HEAR ME?!!\n\n(he is completely right but 1. yelling 2. I hate that $HIT put me in this situation)\n\n$Me: \\*Internally\\* oh f\\*\\*\\*... what do I do I really need to finish the traineeship for the qualifications. Shit shit shit....... BRAINWAVE!\n\n$Me: Ok, sorry sir. The Admin password for that laptop should be \\*PASSword123\\* \n\n(it was actually \\*passWORD123\\*)\n\n$Owner: That didnt work!\n\n$Me: Aw damn, looks like its fully locked down. Would you like me to come round and take a look?\n\n$Owner: Get it done. \\*Hangs up\\*\n\nNow I would never do that these days unless there was OT involved but I was young and desperate to keep the higher-ups happy. I drove over to his house and jumped on the laptop to be a tech wizard and \"unlock\" the laptop. I then created a new \"admin\" account which gave him no additional access. $Owner was happy that he got the password out of us and my $HIT was happy that I didn't give him the real one... man that was stressful. I grew some balls and let $HIT know what i thought about the situation and how unfair it was. Rock and a hard-place and all that.\n\nThe whole situation made me grow up quickly and solidify my IT backbone a bit.",

For the past several years, we've been offering \"retired\" computers (i.e. they are 4+ years old and have been replaced) to employees for $100 each.  They have a clean install of Windows 10 and nothing else, and we make clear that they are offered with no warranty or support whatsoever and could last 5 years or could die in 30 days.  Nevertheless, we get a few takers because they're a lot better than what you can normally pick up for that price.  I'm sure it helps that I take the ones with the lightest use off the pile to recondition and sell.\n\nApparently one of our faculty members heard about this offer through the grapevine, because yesterday afternoon, she sent me this email:\n\n&gt;To: thefultonhow  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From: FacultyMember  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Subject: Used Computer?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;thefultonhow,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My husband would be very interested in my purchasing a used computer through \\[school\\], is there anything available?  If so he is thinking about the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8th Generation i5 processor with 16 GB Memory and 1 TB of storage.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FacultyMember\n\nI saw it this afternoon, and after I got my guffaws under control, I replied with this email:\n\n&gt;To: FacultyMember  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From: thefultonhow  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FacultyMember --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those specs are better than the ones we're buying new!  This year, we bought 8th gen i5s with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB SSDs for storage on laptops (7th gen i5s with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSDs for desktops).  Any computers we sell would be at least four years old, and would likely come with i5s from 2013 or 2014, 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM, and 320 GB hard drives.  If your husband wants something better than that, he's going to have to look elsewhere.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;thefultonhow\n\nI bcc'ed my boss and texted him:\n\n&gt;lol, check out the email I just bcc'ed you on.  it's amazing\n\nHe responded a few minutes ago:\n\n&gt;Lol, do you have a junker you can sell me?  I'll take a Bugatti Veyron if you have any\n\nSeems accurate.",

        "text": "This didn’t happen recently but probably more than 10 years ago.  I work for one of Canada’s major banks and was supporting an application that provides corporate clients an official report on their holding with the bank on any given date.   The app at that time was written in VB and connected to various databases which were MS Access.  A database was getting quite full so i had archived it and created a new one over the weekend. The way the app worked is that the users would have to edit a configuration and provide the full path to the database for the given date range.  Easy stuff, right?\n\nMonday morning rolls around and everything is smooth until one user calls up and tells me the app is throwing an error saying database does not exist.  I asked if she followed my instructions on how to edit the config and she assured me that she followed it step by step and that she still can’t get it work.   She’s getting frustrated and deep down so am I.  I walk through the same steps and get her to read me out the database path that she entered and it seemed fine. I again get her to repeat it, again she’s telling me the right thing.   I hunt around and am 100% convinced that it is a problem with the path, and that she’s likely confusing a back slash with a forward slash.   I tell her this and she snaps back “NO. I entered everything fine”.   I get getting beyond pissed at this point cause I know she has it wrong.  She’s going on and on that I don’t know what I’m doing and that I am wasting her valuable time and that my problem should be escalated.   I calmly say, hey do you have a piece of paper?   She says yeah, of course.  I tell her grab a blank piece and a pencil or pen.  Got that yet?   She says yes.   Ok, now take your pen or pencil and draw a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.    I wait.   Are you done yet?   Yes, she says.  Ok good..   what you’re looking at on the sheet is a back slash.   CLICK...   I didn’t hear another world from her the rest of the day so I guess I fixed her issue!!!",

        "text": "Just remembered this one. Pretty minor, all things considered, but amusing.\n\nOver the last couple of months, I've been upgrading our desktops from spinning-disks to SSDs. I've gradually refined my process and can get a machine reliably copied in an evening (it's not a simple case of just DD'ing the partition since the SSDs are smaller (512GB vs 1TB), consistent with the machines we've bought with SSDs as standard, since we don't store masses of data locally).\n\nA colleague messages me saying his machine (with a spinning disk) is giving him a warning about the boot partition being full - Ubuntu has the annoying habit of creating very small `/boot` partitions so this happens quite a lot. Sometimes a simple `apt-get autoremove` is enough so long as there's a little bit of available space, but other times, APT does its best to plough through and use every last byte. This was one of those occasions.\n\nSo I SSH into the machine and begin clearing sufficient space on `/boot` by hand, then nuking the old kernels. Meanwhile I'm chatting with $colleague on Slack as I work.\n\n&gt;$me: okay, so I've cleared space, now I'm gonna work through the pending updates.  \n&gt;$colleague: great. while you're at it, my machine is *really* slow when I first fire it up. I mean, I can go get a coffee and it won't have loaded up CLion.  \n&gt;$me: ah, that's kinda expected, CLion has tonnes of tiny little files it touches when it starts. Probably the disk holding you back.  \n&gt;$me: &lt;begin typing a sentence about putting him on the list for an SSD upgrade&gt;  \n&gt;$colleague: hang on a mo  \n\nI blink. He drops off Slack.\n\nI switch back to my terminal. My SSH session has died. I look at the last thing it got to.\n\n`Generating initramfs for &lt;current kernel&gt;...`\n\nOh.\n\nI wander over to him, and sure enough, he's rebooted his machine. And it's dropped to an initramfs shell.\n\n&gt;$colleague: umm... what happened??  \n&gt;$me: &lt;with great patience&gt; what did you reboot for?  \n&gt;$colleague: that always made my last machine run faster...  \n&gt;$me: &lt;explain that he's interrupted the initramfs generation and essentially nuked his current kernel until I rebuild it&gt;  \n&gt;$colleague: uh, so it's not like Windows then?  \n&gt;$me: indeed. so I was going to suggest putting you on the list for an SSD, but now I think it's going to be faster to give you one of the already-upgraded spares. Well done forcing my hand, sir...  \n\nExactly what I did - pulled my spare freshly imaged SSD-powered desktop out of the cupboard, set it up on his desk, get him logged in, PXE-boot his machine and `rsync` his files off the HDD onto the new SSD. He gets his upgrade, I put in an order for another spare SSD.\n\nI don't hold it against him, after all he did have *extremely* good timing for triggering the reboot - a few seconds either side and the initramfs would be fine. Despite me clearly telling him I was logged in and working on his machine, he decided spur-of-the-moment to reboot with a quite ambiguous warning.\n\nAnd yes, I know I could have rebooted him into a previous kernel, but I decided to etch in the need to be more careful about doing stuff with Linux - that it will do *exactly* what you tell it to do, so please be extremely careful what the instruction is!\n\nI also learned that it's *extremely* difficult to disable the ability to restart an Ubuntu machine...",

        "text": "This happened a couple of days ago, I work in a call center for a company that accepts walkins too. One lady (a rather notorious bad user that likes to call 4 minutes before closing to try to trick someone into formatting a PDF for her real quick so she doesnt have to) she comes in with her company laptop about 15 mins before we have to leave. Her version of windows is corrupted. Usually for this we almost always just pull the HD and reformat with a new one. We explain the steps to fix it and she insists she needs it for a conference tomorrow 3 hrs away. Again not a problem we have loaners setup for this specific purpose. We get one out, make sure its ready and hand it to her. Shes grateful for the loaner and then asks how fast we can do the reformat because she needs it tomorrow. \n\nMy coworker and I look at each other a moment before explaining again how we have to fix it and that the loaner should be everything she needs for tomorrow. She chuckles and says \"oh no I need all my reports and powerpoints\" we tell her we cant get the data off it today as it was closing time. She doesnt understand so we tell her to come by tomorrow morning and we can take care of it,  she says she won't have time so she wants to just take the bricked computer with her. We explain why that seems really dumb and pointless but the words just go right over her head so I allow it. She leaves with a blank loaner and her computer with inaccessible data. We shrug and make a note to call her in 2 weeks when the loaner is due back. ",

        "text": "I work for a small MSP as the guy in charge of centralized services (basically if more than one of our clients is managed from a central dashboard, it's in my jurisdiction -- this includes backups, managed AV, monitoring, etc...). When backups are humming along, virus threats from users are at a lull, and the server fires are at a controlled burn, I will pick up some slack and work service desk tickets. I was not prepared for this particular ticket.  \n\nThe one I picked up this day was internal: $User accidentally deleted some emails she needs back. This is typically not an issue, as all but a very few of our clients use Orifice 365 and have their mail backed up using the SaaS backup service offered by one of our partners. \n\nSince it's in-house and I could use the exercise, I walk across the building and find $User sitting at her desk, in the middle of a call. She sees me and holds up a finger to let me know she's almost done. She finishes the call and looks at me.  \n\n**$User**: Hey, $Zeihous.  \n**$Me**: Hey. So, you've got some email you deleted and need to recover. What folder were they in?  \n**$User**: Uh... they were in the Deleted Items folder. \n\n**$Me**: ...\n\n*No, this can't be,* I thought.\n\n**$User**: What?  \n\n**$Me**: So, the emails were in the deleted items folder and you deleted them again? You deleted these emails *twice* on accident?  \n\n**$User**: Well, I didn't delete them twice. I kept them in the Deleted Items folder so I could look at them later. \n\n**$Me**: You kept your important emails in the email trash can so you could look at them later?\n\n**$User**: ...it sounds kinda stupid when you say it out loud. \n\n**$Me**: Create a folder in your inbox for them and keep them there in the future. \n\n\nI gathered information I needed from $User to find the emails we're looking for. I load up the backups from right before she deleted the emails and find several hundred emails that exactly match, but, because the only terms I had to search brought up several thousand other emails as well, I couldn't simply restore the entire search, as that would make it difficult to sort through and I'd end up with even *more* work to do. So, I just restore the entire mailbox to the inbox under a folder labeled \"Restore from:\" and the date and let her sort through it. I emailed her to let her know that the restore will take a little time, but if she doesn't have it by tomorrow morning to give me a call back. \n\nThe next morning I get a call from $User. \n\n**$User**: The folder isn't there. \n\n*I know I told it to restore. It surely can't take* this *long*\n\n**$Me**: Okay, I'll be over in a minute. \n\nI walked back across the building and ask her to show me what she's seeing. She indicates the Inbox folder. \n\n**$User**: See? It isn't there.\n\n**$Me**: Expand the Inbox folder. \n\n**$User**: What?\n\n**$Me**: See the little triangle beside 'Inbox?' Click that. \n\n**$User** clicks the triangle and a folder labeled \"Restore *date*\" pops up. \n\n**$User**: Oh! There it is. Okay, let's see...\n\nShe clicks on the folder. Nothing pops up in the message pane. \n\n**$User**: There's nothing here. \n\n**$Me**: Expand the folder. \n\n**$User**: What? \n\n**$Me**: Click the little triangle. \n\n**$User**: Oh, yeah.\n\nShe expands the folder and sees a bunch of other folders that were in the restore. She clicks on Inbox. \n\n**$User**: They're not here. \n\n**$Me**: Where did you keep them?\n\n**$User**: Oh! \n\nShe clicks the Deleted Items folder and finds the messages she's looking for. I tell her that she'll need to go through and find them and move them to another folder. Once she's found everything she needs, she can delete the folders named \"Restore.\" She thanks me and I go back to my desk and the comforting, forehead-shaped indentation. \n\nHowever, the next day, I come back from lunch to a voicemail from $User. \n\n**$User**: Hey, $Zeihous. The folder is gone. It isn't there anymore. Can you come take a look? \n\nI go back to her desk and find that she has once again forgotten how to expand the folders. We have a little tutorial again and she is satisfied that she has her emails back. \n\nOf all the gin joints in all the world...\n",

So, without further ado, let me present the conclusion in: \n\n**I'm Basically The Manager pt 2: - I'm Actually The Manager!**\n\n\n\"Welcome to IT Service Desk! You're speaking to UnintentionalAss, how can I help you?\"\n\n*The man from The Dark Abyss of Ignorance sounds very tired, like he just woke up. I almost picture him sitting in his underwear, barely awake, in gloomy dim, light, perhaps a wee bit hung over.*\n\n\"Yes, hello. I'm calling about an issue regarding [company + location that seem very familiar], and I have a ticket number here, and, erh... Do you want my user-ID..?\"\n\n*He gives me his User-ID, and he starts reading me the ticket number - but I recognize this account, and I know exactly which ticket he's referring to. I have it pasted in my notes, just in case I'd get this call - and by the hand of God, I am handed the resolution to the problem for the poor man who was basically the manager, and Gary, the Password-Pusher!*\n\n\"Yes, Sir, I have the ticket right here! And you need a password reset, right?\"\n\n*He makes some low grunt of confusion.*\n\n\"That's right...\"\n\n\"And just to confirm, you are Mr. Manager and you are actually the manager on this site?\" \n\n\"Yes, of course I'm *actually* the manager.\" \n\n\"I'll need a number I can reach you on, Sir.\"\n\n\"Yeah, um, I'm on vacation - can I give you my private number? Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, no worries, Sir, that'll be grand!\"\n\n*He gives me his number and hangs up, so that I can do my thing. I unlock the account with a smile on my face, picturing BasicallyTheManager taking a liberating breath, lost in The Abyss no more. I call Mr. Manager back.*\n\n\"Hello, IT Service here! Thanks for waiting! Are you ready for your new password, Sir?\"\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n\"[Bravo, Oscar, Lima, Lima, Oscar, X-ray, Zero, Five]\"\n\n*Middle-aged and old men love the phonetic alphabet.*\n\n\"That's it? All right, thank you.\"\n\n\"No problem, Sir! And hey - make sure Gary doesn't get his hands on it this time!\"\n\n*He chuckles loudly and snorts.*\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind, Sir... A serious piece of advice, though - perhaps you should consider ordering some permissions for your employees, so that this issue with your account is not repeated any time soon.\"\n\n*He gets quiet for a bit, seems a little stumped, and to my surprise and delight, I meet with no resistance.*\n\n\"Um, all right...\" \n\n\"Cheers! Have a nice vacation now!\"\n\n\"Yeah, thanks! Bye.\"\n\n*He hangs up, and I lean back in my chair. Feels good being me sometimes. Actually feels good.*\n\n",

        "text": "Couldn't find the Tales from Product Managers page but this might fit here. I currently work at a start-up that had been founder led for the last 3 years and recently brought on a product owner (PO) to get the dev guys in line and organize the sprints around priorities. Us Professional Services teams had been sending any new features to the exec team and having them decide what was important but now we were to have 'process'.\n\nThe plan the PO put in place was actually really good and outlined the process well; since it is only the first two steps that matter here they were:\n\n1. Get requirements, build out functional request\n2. Open Jira and send to Architecture\n3. etc\n\nSince I have been here 1 year I had a queue of over 20 of Features that I thought would be good in the future but didn't have any customer leverage or were internal and needed more discussions with the devs on how we could accomplish. I had created Jiras, and assigned to myself as to be put in my queue for easy access for when they were ready.\n\nD = PS Director\n\nPO = Product Owner\n\nMe\n\nD: \"PO is saying your not following his new process, he found a bunch of Jiras with just links\"\n\nMe: \"Those are just supposed to be internal and are for reference until I have all the requirements and can move to step 2\"\n\nI thought that was good enough until about a week later I got a Slack from PO, very angry now.\n\nPO: \"How can you have a 6 month feature request open and not be following the process, if these need to be looked at they should be done and moved to step 2\"\n\nMe: \"They are not ready, just ideas.\"\n\nPO: \"They can't move to Architecture in this shape, they are just one line, not even a story\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I know I have not even gotten to step 1 in your new plan\"\n\nPO: \"But they are still in your name, Architecture won't even be able to see them\"\n\nMe: \"Correct, they are not ready, that's why they are in my name. When I am done with requirements I'll move to Architecture\"\n\nPO: \"This might be escalated\"\n\nLater the PS Director came over to explain that he was just concerned with 'aging Jira' tickets, so I guess now there will be some adjustments for a pre-step 1, if you have ideas just keep them in a notebook.",

        "text": "Another story to go along with my [tale of the broken installation](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m94wc/its_installed_where/).\n\nThe big difference with this tale is that I take an awful lot of the blame for what went wrong.\n\nMy own stupidity and not making time for the simple stuff left us pretty far up the creek without a paddle in sight. But please do remember, before you judge me too much, that as skilled as I am, I was simply used as a firefighter whenever those above me screwed the pooch. I had little knowledge of the infrastructure as that information was kept from me.\n\nSome backstory...\n\n&gt;As the IT Manager (**$ITM**) in my previous story was heading out the door to retire off on the south coast, his handover procedure was, shall we say, a little hamfisted. The main thing affected for the purposes of this story, is backups.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because it's always the bloody backups.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For a couple of years, I (**$TR**) had complained that as what was essentially a \"keep the gears running\" team, we needed e-mail alerts for everything. Backups, Hyper-V clusters, anything. I wanted something to tell me if there was an issue so I could get into it quickly and try and rescue it before it affected the couple of thousand people I worked for.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alas, my cries fell on deaf ears and the information hogging $ITM simply read all the alert emails and told us what to fix. It made things a load of fun when he was on leave.\n\nAnyways.\n\nUpon handing his notice in, he started to edit these email settings so they mailed me directly.  I very quickly set up a Distribution List for such things and asked him to send them there.\n\n*MISTAKE 1 - I definitely should have done this myself. Why, will become apparent pretty soon.*\n\n**$ITM** \"It'll mail you anytime it has an error or fails a backup\"\n\n**$TR** \"Not for successful backups?\"\n\n**$ITM** \"No, there's too many jobs and it'll spam you and you'll just ignore them.\"\n\n*MISTAKE 2 - I know, I can hear you all screaming at me. I should have gone and changed that.*\n\nLet's assume now that everything was running smoothly and I wasn't fighting a constant slew of dumpster fires on a daily basis just to keep things running for the 4 weeks between $ITM leaving and where our story starts.\n\nA 6th form student (**$ST**) rushed into the room - on a friday afternoon of all the times he could - and kick starts just a shower of awfulness.\n\n**$ST** Mr TR, I have lost my work!\n\n*I've dealt with this particular student before. He's a decent kid and hasn't been one to BS me in the years I've been there so I forego the usual crap and we jump straight into it.*\n\nI log on to the backup server and start the process of running a restore.\n\nExcept, there's no backups for the last five weeks.\n\nNone.\n\nZilch. Zero.\n\nS\\*\\*\\*!\n\nRight, there has to be an explanation, lets have a look.\n\n\\*\\*$TR \"\\*\\*The server's being a pain in the ass. scribble down the file name and I'll recover it for you once I've slapped it about a bit.\"\n\nIt doesn't take long for me to realise that the problem is that the backups have been failing, daily, for a full month!\n\nS\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*!\n\nNot just the student data server. Finacial data, database servers that include information we are legally obliged to hold onto for years and ensure we have backups of. We are in a right mess.\n\nI am in a right mess.\n\nS\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*!\n\nI could honestly see my job going out the window at this point.\n\nI dig.\n\nI read through logs of jobs that I should have had mailed to me and discover that the repository has completely run out of space. I dig a little deeper and it appears that it has been doing this for months and $ITM has \"*cured\"* it by either manually deleting old backups or extending the datastore it's using as a repository.\n\nOh crap!\n\nThe datastore...\n\nMy worst fears come to life when i see that no only has the volume for the Backup Repo filled to capacity. every other volume is throwing alerts for low space and everything is over-provisioned.\n\nS\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*! S\\*\\*\\*!\n\nSurely I should have gotten emails about this, too?\n\nNow I'm in a rabbit-hole of errors I need to find and I'm yet to recover this poor kid's work.\n\nAt this point, it's time to fess up and go see someone and tell them about the prolem(s) before someone else does.\n\n&gt;*I'd honestly never held my head in true shame until this day. When I walked into the Business Director's office to explain myself.*\n\nMeetings with financial directors and head teachers and department leads soon follow and I have to explain over and over again the issues and stand there and say I have no idea why I didn't know they were happening. The first of my three prepared envelopes doesn't feel like an appropriate excuse for a f\\*\\*\\* up this monumental.\n\nThe thing about this story is, there was no magical fix that brought everything back to life. It was a near impossible situation.\n\nI sat with the student and recovered what I could from the locally stored files on the last computer he was logged in to (thank god the profile wipe on logout wasn't working) and instead of losing weeks of work he only lost a couple of hours.\n\nI had a little bit of goodwill left over from $ITM retiring and me keeping things going and I managed to keep my job. But not without being hauled up in front of a committee of governors and having to explain why i wanted to spend tens of thousands on a new backup system with a separate repository. As well as a few grand on increasing RAM on all of our hyper-visors that were running an entire academy's worth of servers on barely enough memory to keep the place functioning.\n\nIt was an absolute nightmare few weeks that ended with a checklist being created for whoever was in first everymorning to go through to make surethings were still standing. and to warn us of any incoming issues.\n\nAnd the problem with the emails?\n\nWanna take a guess?\n\n$ITM can't spell.\n\n[servicedesk@thisschool.com](mailto:servicedesk@thisschool.com) became [servicedeks@thisschool.com](mailto:servicedeks@thisschool.com) and was copy-pasted into everything and never checked.\n\nTL:DR\n\nDon't rely on other people to do the work for you.\n\nEver.",

It doesn't seem tinted to me.\n\nI spend about thirty minutes with him jiggling with the monitor settings - hot, cold, contrast, etc, but the user still sees blue - and he gets his manager to back it up.\n\nNow, I'm going to be a rude noob POS here, but with this company, we have an issue with *everyone* trying to get custom monitors, either from IT, or bought from [insert retailer here] using their division's budget - and I can't blame them, because who wants a sad 22-inch [RHYMES WITH PEMOVO] when you can have a 32 144hz [RHYMES WITH THE SPANISH PRONUNCIATION OF 'JESUS'] monstrosity, especially if you work with editing manuals or design and work in a wing where half the cubicles have them?\n\nI, being a noob, assumed they wanted one of the spare fancy monitors in lieu of the two monitors. (This wasn't too long after I got caught between an exec and her boss nearly get into a shouting match over buying the fancy monitors, while I was trying to install said monitors.) Yes, I'm a dolt for thinking this, because he didn't say *anything* about wanting the new fancy monitors. \n\nI'm weirded out and tell my mentor, who goes with me.\n\nShe reports it's blue, too, and gives me a look. (Note: we both wear glasses.) We replace it with one that was significantly less blue.\n\nI found out why the monitor looked blue and had crappy resolution, as well - one of the monitor brands we use has a new version of one of their models that looks *exactly* the same as the old one until you plug it in, and it has things like \"actual HD support from Apple\", \"doesn't look like hot garbage if you set it to a higher resolution\", and 'doesn't have a weird blue wash to everything'.\n\nAnd, of course, I've got a hot date with the ophthalmologist and the opticians.

        "text": "After seeing a post about mercury starting to go into retrograde it reminded me of a story.  \n\n\nSome years back I used to work at a company that supported a few dozen small/medium law firms.  One of the daily tasks we had was to verify backups ran just fine the night before and make sure the next tape was in for that evening's run.  One particular small client has this strange woman working there as a paralegal that was in charge of swapping the tape.  She was one of those people that was into all that new age nonsense, crystals, astrology and the whole nine yards.  When I first started working there I kept chasing and chasing her to put in tapes with no response.  Finally I voiced my concerns to a coworker she told me that the woman only put in the tapes when mercury was in retrograde because it effects technology.  WTF?  So as you can imagine that eventually was a major issue for them.  They lost a bunch of data and the last tape they had to go back to was months old.  I think they had paper copies of a lot of the documents but every time they needed to do a quick edit on the document they were sitting there hand typing the document over so they can revise it with a few quick edits.  This was before good OCR software was out there so it ended up being quicker to retype than to scan, OCR and fix the messed up scanned document.  ",

        "text": "Following my adventures with the old server this will be the second part of my story fixing the unfixable.\n\n\nEverything written happened a few years ago and I have left behind the workplace for (somehow related) other reasons. \nThe first part can be found [here](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/91ifcg/the_cabinet_of_horrors_part_i_discoveries/).\n\nThe third part can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/953gs7/the_cabinet_of_horros_part_iii_the_call_of_cthulhu/).\n\n\nA week goes by. The summer heat stresses the poor little server in its smeltering hot room even more but it is still holding up. The sensors say 70°C and I get a little nervous.\n\n&gt; $boss, you know, that server can die every minute now, we need an exit strategy. \n\n\n&gt; It worked until now, why should it break now? \n\n\n&gt; Come on… I won't even argue with that. I won't be available for projects for the next couple of days, FYI.\n\n\n&gt; But…\n\nAnd I was on my way, knowing I won't be thanked for any work I would do, but saving the company would be nice. \n\nFirst thing I established a fallback for the AD, file server, printer, everything with our head office in another country. With our 100mbit connection this would not be ideal but it would keep us working (besides sending a printing job a thousand kilometers to another country and back to the printer next to you is grotesque).\nThis took a great deal of discussion if this was really necessary (yes) safe (it's your VPN, tell me) or efficient (hell no) but in the end I had a fall-back if (or when) the server goes belly-up.\n\n\nNext I gathered the two unlucky interns and started cleaning up the storage cabinet. That was honestly a bit entertaining. The office was relatively new and they must have just crammed all the stuff in there that nobody could decide to throw away. \nEmpty printer cartidges worth 5 years of heavy printing (and 75€ in recycling - bought the interns lunch and ice cream), old tech and stuff I just recycled no questions asked and so on. \nSometimes $boss came along and saw the piles of garbage.\n\n&gt; You can't throw that away, we will need that…\n\n\nOf course I can and I will. Nobody needs 47 spare VGA cables (yes I counted and the whole office was rocking HDMI or DP since I started taking over). \n\n\nBut the best part were the documents. The whole company was active in a heavily regulated field. By that I mean third party audits, really high market entrance thresholds and documentation for every little thing. \nThat documentation was in this small room. With lots of paper. And printer toner. And a small in size but considerable fire hazard. So as long as this little dragon slept in there I kept all of that stuff somewhere else. \n\n\n&gt; Why are these shelves full? \n\n\n&gt; Because I like my job (yes, still) and don't want the company lose the very foundation that enables us to work…\n\n\n&gt; Ok…\n\n\nThe whole ordeal felt like emptying the Tardis. Heaps of stuff the same size as the room were moved. \n\n\nFinally we reached the methaphorical bottom and another surprise awaited us. Customer prototypes (classified of course) and a complete CAD workstation worth a couple thousand just sat there and nobody seemed to miss them. \n\n\n&gt; Hey $boss did we at some point do projects with x, y and z? Do they maybe want their stuff back?\n\n\n&gt; What do you mean? Like paper work? They got that ages ago.\n\n\n&gt; I mean this stuff.\n\n\nSo I proceeded to dump these sometimes bulky prototypes on the desk of $boss just (to annoy him) make sure that they are taken care of. \n\n\nEventually my intern moving crew got the new, very exciting task of calling the former customers and inquiring where to send their devices. You would not believe how difficult it is to get companies to take back their own property.\n\n\nSo after lots of moving and cursing ends this chapter of my epic quest to establish some kind of IT infrastructure that deserves this name and soon™ there will be a story about how I unleashed to Kraken to shorten a discussion about remote support. And that little server was still going strong and got a little relieve when I put a huge ventilator in the doorway to the room so it would not just spontaniously combust...",

Hanging out in my office one day when one of the 1LT's came up to me needing help with a question. Her setup at her desk is one laptop connected to two external monitors. She states that \"she has a meeting in about 30 minutes and she needs help projecting her power-point onto the big TV's in the conference room, but her files aren't showing up on the TV!\" I tell her no issue I can help with that even though hooking up a HDMI to a laptop is pretty much something a child can do. I walk over to the conference room with my buddy (he just wants to get out the office). I'm looking at the setup and notice she has the HDMI going from the TV and its connected to one of her external monitors which is plugged in and powered on. So I'm looking around for her laptop assuming its somewhere in sight. After a few minutes I notice the laptop isn't there and ask where is it? She then states \"No I don't need the laptop my power-point along with all my other files were saved onto the external monitor\" My co-worker immediately understood what she was trying to say and busted out laughing. I was still puzzled on what she was trying to tell me. I asked what did she mean? She said \"I always dragged my files from the desktop to this monitor so all my files are on this monitor, so I brought it to hook it up to the TV!\" I then realized why he was laughing so hard, which btw he was still laughing extremely hard. I just stood there in shock being that this LT always like to mentioned she was a West Point grad. Instead of wasting my time explaining it I just went to her office, grabbed the laptop and did what needed to be done. She still didn't see why I needed to laptop when the files were on the monitor. After it was done I walked with my buddy back to the office and we laughed for the rest of the day. These are the people leading todays troops folks.",

There was a big compliance issue opened because one of our business units was doing their own access administration, so we have to move everything into our platform, but in a nonstandard way. \n\nThe technology group swears they have permission from all the application owners to use their application as a launch pad for their access requests. I go through the pain of setting up several assets and an SFTP route for them to send in their profiles/roles. \n\nToday I get a call from the app owner who says he never gave permission for this and he wants it removed - problem is, since our app is a controls tool, we can't remove an instance once it's been created. He yells at me for 20 minutes while I try to explain I was lied to by tech. He finally accepts that and apologizes for yelling at me for Tech's mistake. Then I get an email from the project manager saying the project is shut down indefinitely until they figure out how they want to handle the nonstandard stuff.\n\nSo glad I'm on vacation tomorrow and next week.

One of those persons never calls us directly, she just asks the other girl to call us because she's \"too busy\". They're technically partners and equals in their department but there's always a \"boss/assistant\" relationship.\n\nAnyways, co-worker takes the call and it's a desktop that won't turn on (\"The CPU won't turn on\". Anyone else have users that call the desktop case \"The CPU\"?).\n\nHe's going through the normal debugging steps; check for loose cables, if cleaning lady didn't accidentally turn off the PSU's switch on the back, plug in another thing to check the outlet is working, etc. Nothing seems to work.\n\nFor context, we're a small team of 2 which are hired specifically to attend to our location's problems which are all sales/accounting/payroll issues. We're not technically supposed to be solving other office's problems but we do since we're \"the IT guys\". That means we can't physically go to the office since it's a 2 hour drive on peak-hours then another 2 hour drive back. And anyways, the user's job requires her to work on that office on the morning and then come to our office since theirs requires to close at 1:00 PM.\n\nSo co-worker asks a sensible and understandable \"We'll then just disconnect the computer and bring it here, we'll check it out\" to which she immediately and without any sense of irony or respect replies:\n\n\"No, I won't do it\".\n\nPartner is dumbfolded. \"Why? It's easy I can walk you through and it'll take you 1 min and you can't work anyways...\"\n\n\"No, it's just too much work. I won't do it. Thanks for nothing.\"\n\nAnd then proceeds to tell him of another problem with the other lady's scanner that isn't working, but she's currently dealing with a client so she can't answer the phone or do tests.\n\n\"Ok then\" co-worker replies \"then call me back when she's done or bring us the scanner later when you come here anyway...\"\n\nHe immediately gets put on hold, and then the same reply\n\n\"She says we can't do it. She doesn't want the scanner disconnected\".\n\nCo-worker \"Ok, then we can't help you if that's the status of things. We'll put it on a to-do list and deal with it when we can go there. Is there anything else we can help you with?\"\n\n\"No, nothing\" *click*\n\nAnd then he looks to me with his best face of I can't believe this just happened",

        "text": "Hello again, TFTS! This story happened a few months ago, but I was just reminded of it and figured it'd be worth sharing with y'all. No disgruntled clients this time, just a tale of a spouse and a server rack. \n\nThe cast:\n\n* $Me: hi! :D\n* $DW: my Dear Wifey\n\nI have a few small clients on the side with my small business, mostly maintenance and remote support when they have an issue. Unless it's an emergency, most of this work is at night or on the weekends when I'm not at my day job, and said day job is flexible enough that I have been able to leave early on the rare occasion that one of them has a crisis. For the most part, it's maybe 5-10 hours a week between all my clients, so not that much work really.\n\nI have a small server rack at home that hosts mine and $DW's websites, runs our home file/media server, and is a testing ground for various VM's and projects for myself and my clients. The rack itself has three small servers, a battery backup, modem/router/switch, and external backup drive with a label reading: \"GRAB IN CASE OF APOCALYPSE\" ($DW's idea, since she would have no clue otherwise what to grab in case of emergency). Also, there is a power strip running across the middle of the rack, with six outlets facing outward (important later), and more facing inward to power the various attached devices. The power strip is connected to the battery backup, as are all three servers (also important). This little server rack sits nicely between our desks, the twinkling of blue and green lights keeping us company during our gaming marathons and work sessions. The outlets on the front are usually for charging phones or cameras, and occasionally a computer or monitor when doing repairs.\n\nOne lovely evening, it dawns on us that it's trash night. $DW and I collectively sigh, and pause our raiding for a moment of adult responsibilities. $DW offers to vacuum around the office and scoop the litter box if I take the trash bags down and empty the vacuum when she's finished. I agree, and we set to our tasks.\n\nNow, our condo has everything upstairs except for the garage, where the trash bins are stored during the week. I load up all the trash (because more than one trip is for sissies), and start walking down the stairs to the sound of the vacuum rolling across the carpet. I get the bins loaded, hauled out to the curb, and start to close the garage door when I hear the vacuum power down. A strange, high pitched whine can be heard, but it's hard to pinpoint what the source could be as the garage door is rumbling shut. I head back inside, and notice the whining is notably louder now, and coming from upstairs. As I take the last step up, I'm greeted by a mortified $DW, her eyes wide with fear.\n\n&gt; $DW: I think I did something bad...\n\nI start to open my mouth to ask \"what\", but the shrill sound from the office has my attention. I walk past DW and into the room, and cover my ears. Damn, that thing is loud! In the middle of the room is the vacuum, it's cord trailing off towards... the server rack. The screeching sound is coming from the battery backup, the little light on the front that normally glows blue is flashing red at an alarming rate. All other lights on the server are unlit, no fans whirring, no disks humming softly. Pushing the vacuum aside, I click the buttons next to the battery LCD in an attempt to shut the damn thing up. A few clicks later, and my eardrums are relieved, though I can still hear the faint ringing of the alarm.\n\n&gt; $Me: $DW's *firstname*, what happened? (no terms of endearment are used when my electronic babies are dead, sorry)\n\n&gt; $DW: I was just vacuuming, and the server started to beep. Then everything turned off, and it just went from beeping to a solid tone!\n\nI sighed, and began trying to resurrect the rack. The battery had quieted down to an angry chirp every ten seconds, constantly reminding us that it was dead. The fuse in the power strip hadn't blown, but the battery wasn't giving out any power until it cooled down. From what I could tell, the vacuum pulled about triple the maximum listed amperage the battery was designed to output, and rather than tripping immediately, the battery simply gave its best for about 90 seconds until the charge was too weak, or it overheated and tripped a safeguard. That safeguard switching off took our whole little home network with it, from WiFi to our websites.\n\nI took a moment to explain to $DW what happened, and her already wide eyes bulged out further. Her business is makeup related, so while she knows that everything shutting down at once is bad, she didn't really know how much most of the stuff costs (other than my keyboard, and apparently $150 for a nice mechanical keyboard is *insane*, but a similarly priced Gucci mascara or whatnot is okay).\n\n&gt; $DW: Is anything broken?\n\n&gt; $Me: I'm not sure, but until the battery cools down, I have no way of knowing if anything is fried or not.\n\n&gt; $DW: How much is the battery?\n\n&gt; $Me: About $400\n\n&gt; $DW: o.O    ... and the servers...?\n\n&gt; $Me: Depends on which one... top one is about $2000, middle is around $1200, and bottom is at least $3500.\n\n&gt; $DW: O.O\n\nAfter a few minutes of back and forth of $DW saying I'm pulling numbers our of my ass, and me showing $DW similar models online for FAR more than that (and enjoying the look of her eyes popping out further, seriously it's adorable when she's like that), the battery stopped beeping, and the blue light of life returned. The fans started spinning up in unison, followed by the vacuum roaring back to life. Scared the hell out of us, $DW yelped and jumped back, and I about fell over from the sudden sound right next to me, before yanking the plug out of the socket. A few minutes of checking everything on the servers, and I happily informed $DW that the only thing she broke was the nightly backup, which was in the process of running when my little computer kingdom came crashing down. \n\nThat was about six months ago. We joke about it now, almost anytime one of us decides to vacuum the office, and sometimes when she plugs in anything other than her phone. $DW even put a little label on the power strip \"NO VACUUM *skull-and-crossbones*\". Seriously, I don't know how she even got an emoji from a label maker, but it's a cute little reminder of the near-death experience our servers had that night. \n\n",

I close it, but its still there when I connect to the remote desktop connection again, and FastNovel says I can’t run more reports because something is happening to [spreadsheet software]\n\n\nIm standing here thinking, “This is literally not my job. We paid for the hosted version so that LeftNetworks would handle everything on their servers.\n\n&gt; $me – Well, the way its set up, we cant open the taskmanager to force it closed, and we cant ctrl-alt-del, so I am going to log you out, *clicks start, log off* and that should fix it.\n\n&gt; $cont – Ohh, instead of clicking the X up there?\n\n&gt; $me – yeah, that just closes the connection, it doesn’t actually terminate your session.\n\nSo, we do that, she logs back in, and everything is working for her again.\n\n&gt; $cont – Thank you SO much! I love IT people.\n\n&gt; $me – No problem, that’s what I’m here for.\n\nIt doesn’t happen all that often, but it feels great when I am actually thanked for helping.\n",

I had just grabbed my coffee and wanted to a take sip when suddenly I receive a call from my all time favorite user $CW. Reluctantly I answer the call - after a few sips from my then hot coffee - and am greeted with the following: \n\n&gt;**$CW:** YOU CHANGED MY PASSWORD I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY E-MAILS OVER THE WEEKEND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! \n\nAt this point it's important to note that our Users passwords expire after a set amount of time, which we stated several times but as you can guess no one reads our e-mails... Anyways $CW's password has expired on Friday, and he had to change it accordingly. I know this because he called me on Friday to complain about the password expiration. \n\n&gt;**$Me:** I did not change your password, but I did support you in doing so just three days ago. \n\n&gt;**$CW:** YES I KNOW I HAVE TRIED THE NEW PASSWORD AS WELL IT WON'T WORK! \n\nAt this point the day was already ruined... \n\nI checked his Account on the Server and - surprise surprise - it was locked down due to too many failed login attempts. I wonder how that happened. \n\n&gt;**$Me:** Okay, I just checked on our Server and it looks like you entered a wrong password too many times and your entire account got locked dow-\n\n&gt;**$CW:** I DIDN'T ENTER A WRONG PASSWORD YOU JUST CHANGED IT ON FRIDAY\n\n&gt;**$Me:** I did no such thing, but that doesn't matter now. I've reset your password to our standard password and you'll have to change it the next time you login. \n\n&gt;**$CW:** FINE BUT WHAT ABOUT MY MISSED E-MAILS FROM THE WEEKEND?!\n\n&gt;**$Me:** If you login on your PC and start Outlook you will see all e-mails that came in over the weekend.\n\n&gt;**$CW:** NO I DON'T! THERE ARE NO NEW E-MAILS IN OUTLOOK! I WANT MY E-MAILS!\n\n&gt;**$Me:** If there are no E-Mails you didn't receive any over the weekend.\n\nIt was at this moment when he hung up on me.

        "text": "Back when I was but an IT tech noob, I was working in a corporate hospital ($themed), and I'd gotten a call to run a ticket to install a user's (a nurse director, mind you) desktop printer she wanted added to her device that she'd brought from home. Back in those days, we allowed that kind of thing. When I left that job, things like that were not permitted anymore.\n\nAnyway, I go in to this XP machine and start setting up drivers and such from disk, as was needed back in those days, and plug in the printer, and fire off a test print. Works great. As a general rule, I like to reboot and confirm everything is still working properly.\n\nIt proceeded to shit the bed.\n\nAnd I, being the tech noob I was at the time, absolutely terrified. I'd trashed this nurse director's office machine. I don't even know what I did. So I did what any good tech noob would do. I called in reinforcements. First was the Sailor, who was significantly smarter than I was, and I thought for sure could figure out how I broke this poor innocent machine. After 30 minutes of trying all kinds of stuff, we decide to call in the big gun, Quantum.\n\nNow, Quantum was the guy you'd call when no one else could figure out what was wrong. He was the number one, top person in the entirety of IT that, if he didn't know it, it wasn't beyond him to figure it out.\n\nSo Quantum joins the Sailor and myself, and, for another 30 minutes, this device is just trashed. No one can figure out what happened. So Quantum starts pulling data for recovery purposes to take to build another device for this director, and we proceed to prepare to talk to the nurse director, letting her know her device was dead.\n\nIt was right before we walked out of the room that the Sailor had one more idea. He reached behind the printer I'd installed, pulled the USB cable from it, and rebooted device.\n\nAnd hark, it sprang back to life like the last hour and a half had never happened.\n\nWe both praised the Sailor for his ~~luck~~ brilliance and I was super appreciative he saved me from having to look super dumb in front of this nurse director I didn't know yet.\n\nIt was not until years later I would understand the power of corrupt drivers and how much damage they could cause. You never know what is going to break a machine these days, but my recommendation is to always check the easiest thing first, it has saved me so much time and effort over the years.\n\nThis is not even close to the only story with Quantum and the Sailor (among a whole cast of characters at $themed), if anyone else is interested in hearing about my adventures as an IT noob, and eventually a competent tech, to an IT dragon with them.

Hours went by.

Too fast for him to react to when she ran into the room with that trademark cheerful squeal. Too fast to prevent her from pressing the shiny round button on the front of his computer.  \n\nRemember this was a hardware power button. Electricity ceased to flow through the computer, resetting every bit of its RAM back to zero, including all 6 hours worth of unsaved flow-state data entry.  \n\nA trip to home depot later, the hole in the wall was patched and he was ready to start again with an ice pack on his right hand.  \n\nThe next day, we used hot glue and velcro to create a makeshift removable plastic shield to cover the power button from that point on...",

I deal with everything, and generally do so with a good sense of humor, and without being condescending to any $Lusers. Today was one of the only times in my memory that I've ever been so pissed off at a $Luser that I actually yelled at them, and did it in public. Worse, the $Luser is a manager, and I did it in front of their team. \n\nCharacters\n\n$Me: Yours truly\n\n$OM: The office manager. Main person in charge of the non-clinical staff. Been here longer than I have.\n\nStory\n\nWe have a printer in one of our departments that always gives us a lot of trouble. It tends to disconnect itself from the network, break down at inopportune moments, etc. This printer is plugged into a wall outlet. Also plugged into this wall outlet is a WAP since wi-fi was a late addition to this floor, per $OM's request, who saw me install it, saw where I plugged it in, and saw me hide the wire behind some desktop objects. WAP takes up the only port in the general vicinity of the printer, so for the time being (when the budget has it in it to replace the WAP with one mounted on the ceiling), the printer is plugged into a port on the WAP. I think y'all see where this story is going.\n\nI get a call from the a doctor. Calls are reserved here for the most urgent of IT issues. He's unable to print, and a patient needs a report immediately so they can leave. I remote in, and see that the printer is offline. Great. This printer has a tendency to do this. Check the print server. It also says that the printer is offline. Even more GREAT. So I make my way down to their floor and begin to check the printer. Is it plugged in? Yes. Are there any errors on the printer? No. Is it plugged into the AP? Yes. Is the WAP on? NO. I check the power supply, and it's plugged into the WAP, so that's fine, but then I check the wall.\n\nAnd what do you think I find? The WAP is unplugged. And a $fruitphone power brick is in its place, connected to none other than $OM's cell phone. I plug in the WAP, and put the charger on $OM's desk. I may have slammed it down. \n\nThe following conversation happened in loud tones\n\n$me: You did not seriously unplug that to plug in your phone.\n\n$OM: It looked like a phone charger (note: no phone charger has an actually attached wire to it anymore, unlike this)\n\n$me: HOW?!\n\n$OM: It's not labeled. How am I supposed to know it's supposed to be plugged in?\n\n$me: maybe you ASK before you unplug something. Something you asked me to put there in the first place. Now you've wasted my time, the patient's time and the doctors.\n\n$OM went back to work angry. Meanwhile, I grabbed a label out of a label printer and attached it to the WAP power supply with the words \"DO NOT UNPLUG. $ME WILL KILL YOU.\" in red sharpie and all caps.\n\nTl;dr: $luser disconnects printer to charge cellphone",

The kind of I know it all Ive seen it all you are trying to overcharge and whatnot. Micromanagement squirrel.\n\nThey planned to move into a new office and asked me for a quote. 25 offices. 2 employees per office and they will make a move in with voip phones too.\n\nOpen walls. Easy job. 4x cat5e per office and 5 more for printers and plotters. Office was huge. So I quoted fairly because the office was huge.\n\nWell micro squirrel know it better and got a 1/4 of my quote deal with CAT6 wire. I honestly didn't want to lower my price because it was a fair one and going from cat 5e wire into cat6 one for the same price would be nuts. \n\nEverything went well and good till 2 weeks later I got called for consult and got asked some question about my old quote and why I quoted so many wires. I was like: \"Whaa? What do you mean so many? one per station and 1 per phone. It was a bare minimum actually to make it work just right\"\n\nDeal guy installed 1 cat6 wire in each office. They had to buy little netgear 5ports gigalan switches to plug everyone. So 25 offices = 25x about 50$ switch = 1250$. \n\n2 stations and 2 voip phones on a switch on a single wire. Yeah. Great.\n\nVoip guy was also pissed like hell; he was supposed to install phones with poe switch (power over network wire) and couldn't do it because of the stupid switches everywhere so he had to supply adapters for every phone. it cost them about 30$ for every phone. Overall stupid mess. so 50x30=1500$\n\nIt was bad. Bad. BAD! Systems were losing printers. Printers were losing systems. People on the phones were working inside huge caves on the moon with huge delays and echos over the phones. They actually got an ultimatum from the voip guy: you fix your network bs or I take everything back and then sue me.   \n\nWhat we could do to fix it? Easy: 3 more wires into each office and because walls and some parts of the ceiling couldn't be accessed it would be over 200% our original quote. \n\nSquirrel ass: \"You mean minus the wires already installed.\"\n\nNo. 200% of my original quote to add 3 wires into each office.\n\nYeah we got the job 2 days later. We did it during construction vacation period so it was a very relaxing job. Empty walls so it wasn't so bad. we also used the previous wire to drop ours. We just replaced the face-plate from 1 into 4 connectors. Felt good.",

I got a call yesterday that someone is doing inserts that are messing up their data.  \nOur security policies say it is not authorized to have a program update a production database without attaching a name to the update so naturally I assume the program has details about who is logged into the system. Nope. As I'm talking about this with the person on the phone, the person next to me is in security controls and gets involved. She states what we are doing is not allowed and I need to notify someone.  \nSo I go over to the team lead and detail the problem and how what we are doing is not allowed and goes against our standards. Lead immediately goes into CYA mode. He says the inserts are not done by an unknown ID but are done through a DB insert triggered by the proforma so it is legal. I state again, updating database records without capturing an ID is against our corporate rules.  \nIf I go to corporate about this, the team will know who brought it up. It's my most important team and takes up the majority of my time. The team can choose to drop me if they want and do training through India. It's not the best option, but it is an option.  \nSecurity and Controls wants me to create an issue about this. The application team wants me to stay out of it.  \nI'm going to raise the issue further up the application teams tree first but I do not expect anything to happen there either. Me and the head guy don't always see eye to eye because I bring up issues like this that he wants to ignore.  \nSo corporate says we are supposed to notify the company anytime we find stuff like this. If I notify the company I have a good chance of being pulled from my team which will greatly reduce my value to the company. A true Catch-22. Hosed if I do and hosed if I don't.  \n**Update**: Our team is part of a larger team responsible for all facets of software installed on any plant servers. Including making sure all software is following all rules. My real manager is in India, my in country (US) manager is head of that larger team. We had a meeting yesterday and I told him what was going on. The worms are out of the can.",

        "text": "A long time ago, when Windows NT 4.0 was the new kid on the block, I spent some a few years with the job description of \"The IT Department\" for a company being introduced to the wonders of technology. Here’s two short tales from dealing with one especially bone-headed manager.\n\nI was rolling out the first batch of computers to the warehouse management team. The warehouse manager walks up while I’m unloading some horrible beige Compaq on his desk and picks up the mouse:  \nManager: Ah so this is my new mole… I‘m very good at using them, you know.  \nMe (muttering): I see your knowledge of taxonomy matches your knowledge of management.  \nManager: What was that?  \nMe: I said \"Yes, that’s your new mole\".\n\nThe same manager about 12 months later asks me to fix a problem with his email. A quick change of settings in Outlook and a restart… Yes, send pending emails now... Yes empty deleted items folder… Restart...  Job done. But then I get a call 5 minutes later.  \nManager: You deleted all of my emails!  \nMe: I didn’t delete anything, I just fixed your problem.  \nManager: The Deleted Items folder is empty! That’s where I keep them all - get them back at once!\nI had two options here. Option 1 would mean a lot of messing with last night’s tape backup, but I figured option 2 would be more productive here:  \nMe: Well I think we learned today not to keep important documents in a folder called Deleted Items.  \n\nIt turns out that he’d figured out that pressing the delete key moved his mail to the deleted items folder, and realised how convenient it was to be able to move selected emails easily into another folder. This lead him to believe that this must be a productivity tool for storing priority emails – despite pressing the DELETE key to move the mail to DELETED ITEMS, this was obviously Microsoft’s way for storing important emails.\n",

You're speaking to UnintentionalAsshole, how can I help you?”\n\n*A flustered man’s voice is blowing violent air into my brain from within The Dark Abyss of Ignorance.*\n\n“Uuh, yeah – hello?!”\n\n*He’s running. Why is he running while calling IT-Support?*\n\n“I’ve all but got fire up my arse, and I need to unlock an account!”\n\n“You need to unlock an account with… *fire* up your… behind, Sir..?”\n\n*Start wondering if he shouldn’t call the fire department. Or the police…*\n\n“Aye, that’s right! There’s this guy on vacation, and I just went to lunch, and now I can’t place or receive orders - and I need the account unlocked!”\n\n*Irrational humans who speak inconsistently and without following any sort of lines. My favourite.*\n\n“All right, Sir – let’s see if I can help you! Can you give me your user-ID, please?”\n\n“**Mine**?”\n\n“Yes, Sir, yours.”\n\n“Um, all right, but…”\n\n*He starts giving me letters, but then, he mumbles something, and then changes his mind, and changes the letters. He gives me his user-ID. I look it up. I confirm his name and his phone number. I check the status of his account. It’s not locked out, as far as I can see.*\n\n“Excuse me, Sir, but is it a password reset you need? Because as far as I can see…”\n\n“No, I just want an account unlocked, with the old password!”\n\n“Sir, as I said – if you cannot get into your account, most likely your password has simply expired. Your account is not locked out.”\n\n“No, but it’s not for *me*, though!”\n\n“It’s not for you?”\n\n“*It’s not for me!”* \n\n*It’s not for him.*\n\n“So… Whom is it for..?”\n\n“It’s for the guy on vacation!”\n\n*Of course. Of course it’s for the guy on vacation. Who else would need his account unlocked..?*\n\n“So – just to confirm your issue, Sir – you want me to unlock *someone else’s* account for you; someone who isn’t there to verify that you’re allowed access to his account?”\n\n“Hey! Don’t *put it* like that!”\n\n*I ponder for a second how else I could have possibly put it, but give up once I realize for the gazillonth time that the Users from The Abyss have no logic supporting their actions…*\n\n“All right, then, Sir… Would you please give me your employment status? Are you the Manager? Account operator or Administrator? Any position that would indicate *permission* to access another user’s account?”\n\n“I can give you his name and ID!”\n\n*He’s flustered. He’s going to blow. Not now, but it will happen. I wait for an explosion from The Abyss.*\n\n“That’s all very good, Sir, and we’ll get to it if we get that far, but I need to know your position at the company.”\n\n“Look – I can give you all his details, and I’m not the one who locked him out of his account! I told you, I’ve got fire up my arse and I need to do this, *now*!”\n\n“Calm down, Sir, and would you please confirm your status at the company?”\n\n“I’m, uh… I am, eerh…”\n\n*I can see his account. I can see his position. He doesn’t have the access needed. I just want to hear him try. He pants.*\n\n“Look, hey, just unlock the account, so that the entire company doesn’t *collapse* because we can’t handle the orders coming in! I’m ***basically*** the manager anyway!”\n\n“Excuse me, Sir – you’re *basically* the manager..?”\n\n*I’m almost impressed. No one’s pulled that one before.*\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m *basically* the manager now, because the manager and everyone else above me is on vacation!”\n\n*I mute to chuckle. I’ll remember that when my boss is on vacation – I’ll just tell everyone I’m ‘basically’ the manager…*\n\n“I am very sorry, Sir, but…”\n\n“Look – can you just..? Just unlock it for me, all right?! It wasn’t *me* who did this *stupid* shite anyway – it was this other bloke!” \n\n*There’s another bloke involved in this. Of course there is another bloke.*\n\n“Someone else besides you had access to this user’s account?”\n\n“Well, yeah!”\n\n*He says it like it’s the most natural thing in the world; like I’m the one breaching protocol here.*\n\n“We were using this person’s account, because he’s the only one with permission to place and receive orders, and then I went to lunch, and that other arsehole *idiot* – sorry for cussing – tried to bloody login *five* bloody times – sorry again – with the wrong *pass-bleedin’-word*, and now we can’t get in and place or confirm orders!! I went away, and the other guy tries to login, and he doesn’t succeed – and what does he do then? One sure as *fuck* doesn’t try *five* bloody times with the password that *didn’t work in the first place!!”*\n\n*Oh, the humanity... At this point, I’d be well within my rights to tell him to sober up and talk to me as an adult human male – but I’m not petty like that. I’m petty in a much worse way.*\n\n“No, that does sound awful, but this is very much against the rules – unless you had some sort of employment status that indicated your right to access the accounts of other users in cases of emergencies…”\n\n*He sighs. He breathes deeply.*\n\n“Can you just *look* at the account for me, please?”\n\n*I scratch my itching scull. I check the account. Ah… *This bloke* is the manager, and nowhere – to my infinite, reversed surprise – does it say that the user I’m speaking to has any granted, acceptable access to his accounts or devices.*\n\n“So, Sir… Sir?”\n\n*He pants.*\n\n“Sir..?”\n\n“Yes? Will you please unlock the account for me??”\n\n*I hear others in the background now. They are yelling. Some argue what the original password actually was. Some ask why the account isn’t unlocked yet. The dude I’m talking to goes bananas.*\n\n“NO, *GARY* – THE PASSWORD WAS *NOT* ‘ZEBRA500’, AND I’M TRYING TO TALK TO A BLOKE IN IT TO UNLOCK IT *RIGHT NOW*!!”\n\n*Oh, the urgency… I try to imagine in my mind a place of work where the entire company just goes under because **one guy** went on vacation. I don’t envy these people one bit… I do, however, have a job to do myself, and I cannot risk this sort of security breach. Even if I would want to help them, they are doing exactly ***everything*** wrong right now, and my calls are monitored.*\n\n“Um, excuse me, Sir..?”\n\n*Also, he called me a 'bloke'.*\n\n“Yes?” \n\n*He speaks between his teeth.*\n\n“Sir, according to my records here and according to *any* sort of common security sense, I *cannot* unlock the account for you, and I will *definitely* have to do a password reset – but to do that, I need to speak to the user to whom the account belongs.”\n\n*He sighs. Deeply, painfully.*\n\n“Are you *sure*?”\n\n“I am sorry, but the security guidelines are very clear on this. His account has been locked out, multiple people know his password – or some form of it, it seems - and he is not there to verify any of this. If I had a way to contact him, or if he could contact me…”\n\n“But he’s on vacation!”\n\n“Without his phone?”\n\n“Without his *work*-phone!”\n\n“And none of you have access to the ordering system?”\n\n*He groans loudly.*\n\n“The only other guy who has permission… He’s gone.”\n\n“Gone, Sir?”\n\n“Yeah, he’s *gone*. Not here.”\n\n“All right… Because I really cannot unlock the account for him if he’s neither here nor *aware* of it…”\n\n*He stomps his foot; I can feel the ground shaking from The Dark Abyss. He sighs.*\n\n“Alright… Alright! *Let* the entire company go under! I’ll try and see if I can get a hold of him some way… Maybe he’s on Facebook – who knows..? God dammit! I know it’s not your fault, but God dammit! God dammit, *Gary*!”\n\n“I wish you good luck, Sir.”\n\n“Yeah-yeah – thanks for… Well, for listening to this shite, I guess… Good bye.”\n\n“Good bye!”\n\n*He hangs up.*\n\n*Oh, such problems… And to think – on the day when he was basically the manager…*\n\n\nEdit: I botched a line...\n\n\nUPTADE in this post:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/92mpoc/im_basically_the_manager_pt_2_im_actually_the/\n\nGary's getting out of the corner of shame, you guys, cause he'll be too busy doing his job again!

Easy to fill out takes less than 5 minutes mostly drop down boxes and a few tick ones apart from name, job, date of birthday and a notes field.\n\nThis form submits and goes into our queue to be updated and managed. Anyway this morning I get handed a print out of the form from someone who sits near the service desk explaining she was rattled and annoyed when she brought it up last night after hours as it wouldn't work.  \n\nBasically a lady trying to arrange a new starter got so frustrated it wouldn't submit so she's sending us a paper copy. Firstly we have in big red letters on the form it can only be done electronically for audit purposes and security. \n\nAnyway on closer investigation the user has filled in her own name as the new starter and the manager then put yesterdays date as the DOB and literally not ticked any tick boxes... there's a big bold one at the end which is basically yes I accept terms and understand this form must be done properly.\n\nNo surprises nothing new but a simple one to start your days off. Bare in mind our organisation is very funny about names and details being printed on paper and this has been handed around to several people already!",

        "text": "So this happened 3 years ago. My small business customer of about 40 employees, I do IT stuff for, decided to move office into a new building. Open walls; need network wiring. Easy job. I quoted good network cables almost 40% under market price for whole job; him being good customer and whatnot. \n\nWell I heard back from one of the owners; he found a guy who will do it for half my price and if I'm interested to match it. I was like: \"Wtf? How? Fuck that!\" Unfortunately I couldn't do it but could of course do all the wall-plates and patchpanel-serverroom job to make everything work at my usual per hour fee.\n\nEverything was fine; I was supposed to get there on Friday and complete all job. One day doing network stuff will change me of usual desk-sitting I usually do. I'm all set with my wall plates, patch cables, patch panels and even more patch cables.\n\nOffice is opening on monday morning. All desks are set and all equipment had been moved by moving guys; they did a hell of a job btw. So lets get back to my end of the deal.\n\nAt first I was damn impressed by wiring job: all cables are neatly identified with marker on electrical tape; it does the job. Good. \n\nOMFG! 911! there is only 1 network cable in the server room. WTF? HUH? The other 59? Left in the ceiling? Found a ladder; thanks to electrician still working on lights. Nothing in the ceiling besides 1. FREAKING ONE network wire.\n\nWTF? I have 2 network wires coming out of every hole in the wall; where did damn guy moved all the end of network cables? After checking everywhere in the office and in all broom closets: nothing!  It's time to call the big guy. \n\n(calling, explaining, guy is freaking out, on his way in the new office...)\n\nBy the time he got there I figured out what happened: wiring guy wired 1 single wire from server room into the first hole. 1 wire from 1st hole into the second hole, from second hole into the 3rd... you get the picture. Electrical wiring 101. ALL OF THEM!\n\nDis gonna be good.\n\nWhat are you going to do to fix it? Me? Fix it? I need to have 60 wires in the server room and I have 1 usable. How do you want me to fix it? Its not a fix; its a whole job! Call the damn witing guy. He is not taking calls. Got paid cash. Umm. What are the options? \n\nAbout 60 network wires total. Finished walls with soundproof stuff in there. I'm damn sure I'm not doing it myself. Are you nuts? Must call two of my other techs guys. Its going to be 300% market fee and its a good price trust me on short notice. Sure you can make some calls. 40 minutes later I got the job. I'm sure the price he got made him realize I'm not trying to screw him over.\n\nWe finished late into sunday. It was messy. We made a lot of holes without a single comment from our new stressed out inspector; he actually helped and paid all of our lunches and cold drinks.\n\nWe got paid right after the job; no questions asked. The inexpensive wiring guy changed his phone number btw :)",

This is good for my job, though the amount of \"weird\" issues I've had have been dropping steadily.  I don't know whether to attribute this to students getting better or me just getting used to it.  Anyway, on to this story!\n\n$Me: Shooxjat, school IT\n\n$Kid1: Student with a broken computer\n\nI'm eating lunch one day in my office when I get a kid running into my office.\n\n$Kid1: Mr. Shooxjat, my computer's in a microwave!\n\n$Me: ...Huh?  Take it out of the microwave! (I'm trying to process the previous line. My mental error checking must have been deep.)\n\n$Kid1: No, my computer's in a microwave!\n\n$Me: Okay, so take it out of the microwave?\n\nI'm ashamed to admit at this point I'm going to skip over some rather circular dialog, but this went around a few times more than I'm typing.\n\n$Kid1: But you don't understand, my computer's in a microwave!\n\n$Me: I think I do understand, and step one is to take it out of the microwave.\n\n$Kid1: No, my computer's in a microwave!\n\n$Me: Have you tried taking it out of the microwave?\n\n$Kid1: Yes, my computer was in a microwave and someone turned it on!\n\nNow, eagle-eyed readers of this post may notice the rather abrupt change/clarification of tense in the last line.  I certainly noticed it.  Also... it was in the microwave when the microwave was turned on?  This can't be good.\n\n$Me: Okay, well, where is it?\n\nAt this point, $Kid1 takes the computer out of the bag he's got, and hands it to me.  The first thing I notice is that fine eldritch scent of burnt electronics.  That combination of burnt metal and burnt plastic that we all love so, so much.  I went through the song and dance, and confirmed that it was dead, gave the kid a spare and he left.  I later found out that $Kid1 and $Kid2 were arguing about something, and $Kid2 grabbed $Kid1's computer from him, and put it in a microwave and turned it on.  When asked why he did that, $Kid2 said \"I thought he was going to stop me, but he just stood there!\"  We all were in shock when we heard this, much as I suspect $Kid1 must have been when his computer went into a microwave.  $Kid2's family had to pay to replace the microwave, and the deposit on labor for fixing the computer, which rather surprisingly to me came out to 0 dollars thanks to $Manufacturer counting it as \"accidental damage\".  Wonders never cease.",

        "text": "Our IT Department supports the installation but not the use of MS Office products. As such we generally turn around any support related issue back to the user community. However on occasion we will support when users encounter something unusual.\n\nI get called into some of these for Excel. In this case first tier support gave up on the business manager as he was abusive and uncooperative. \n\nThey ask for my help. I review the ticket. The manager has put multiple curse words into the ticket explaining how we've screwed up the network and now this spreadsheet which is critical to month end close is not working. In reviewing the ticket I discover it is not the manager with the issue but one of his accountants. So I send her an e-mail and after some back and forth I convince her to send me the spreadsheet so I can see what is happening.\n\nI open the spreadsheet and instantly Excel tells me that there are links to other spreadsheets and do I want to update the data in this spreadsheet based on those links. Not having access to the drive mapping for this department etc I tell Excel no but this is my clue.\n\nExcel allows you to link data across multiple spreadsheets. I go inside Excel to see all of the spreadsheets this spreadsheet links to and oh dear. Two spreadsheets on the users C drive (local to her machine) as well as another spreadsheet on their LAN.\n\nI call the accountant and ask her more about her issues. She is trying to share this with other users in her department and they are getting the failed to update data from her C drive. Ahh we have found the issue. I then spend about fifteen minutes explaining to her how networks work and the difference between her C drive and a folder on the LAN which is shared with her coworkers. Plus I threw in an explanation of how to set up the security on the folder so only the people in her department can use this spreadsheet. At the end of this call I have walked her through setting this up and she has moved the files from her C drive to the network and tested. All is good. I closed the ticket.\n\nOr not.\n\nThe manager reopened the ticket and adding even more expletives about IT, Networks, security etc and says this is not fixed to his satisfaction. So I call the user back and talk to her. They did not understand why all of their C drives were not shared across the department. Ahh. So now I give an explanation of why we set the PC's up the way we do and why it is a horrible idea to share everyone's C drive especially if you have anything private on your computer. Not to mention backups, drive failure etc. After some discussion she reluctantly comes around to understanding our method of setting up PC's and the drives etc. I ask her if she wants me to talk to the manager and she says no everything is fine. So I close the ticket again.\n\nOr not.\n\nAgain more expletives etc from the manager. I call the user back one more time and she says everything is working and everyone in the department understands (except the manager). I tell her I am going to close the ticket and we will not respond to it being reopened. She agrees.\n\nBut the manager must get in the last word and as part of our process we send out a customer satisfaction survey which is  rated as low as possible across the board with you guessed it, more expletives in the comments. I reviewed this with the support manager and he agreed I did well above and beyond. \n\nI look up the local technical community college on-line and snap shot the classes around Excel and paste into an e-mail to the manager with a sweet message about education but then I thought why bother. This would be over his head anyway. Still... :)",

At first i just think hes doing something wrong, so i remote in and set the settings for him and showed him how to do it.\n\nDays later he emails me saying that they reset again. I'm thinking what the fuck?! Next thing i do is walk him through getting to the BIOS and check if there are any settings about it there. He listed all the options and nothing was really relevant to the issue. I tell him I'mgoing to do some research on this and get back with him.\n\nA few weeks go by and still i have found nothing on it for him, I pretty much have given up and got sidetracked by other issues and i forgot about it. At least until i was poking around their DC's group policies for a completely unrelated issue, and low and behold in the default domain policy there's a setting for power options! Fuck me sideways, it was a GPO this whole time!\n\nI call him up and i told him i finally figured out his power options issue, after explaining it to him he had a laugh and as did i and proceeded to wipe that setting out of existence.",

        "text": "So. We're setting up a SmallLimp failover cluster - nothing special, and old-school two hosts with failover connected to iSCSI MPIO storage, SQL clustering inside the physical cluster. Completely supported by SmallLimp following their own guidance. This cluster is for one of the client's Big Important Clients.\n\nFor backups, the client has multiple Dingus devices. Dingus is a B2D2C appliance that at this location is covering approximately 30 servers instances. It works... acceptably.\n\nNow, I've never built a SmallLimp cluster and had to back it up with Dingus, and Dingus KB doesn't list anything about SmallLimp clusters except when using them for virtualization, which is decidedly not this case. Google-fu doesn't bring up anything useful either, so it's off to the Dingus ticket system.\n\nI explain the configuration - hosts DB1 and DB2 are physical, the CSVs are letters E-K inclusive, and the virtual name for the cluster is DB0. I flat out ask if there's going to be a conflict when backing up to capture DB1 and DB2's OS drive while backing up DB0, which will inerrantly point to the CSVs.\n\nAfter much experimenting and emails back and forth (most of which were me correcting them that NO IT'S NOT A VIRTUALIZATION CLUSTER) I get the answer \"Yes, that'll work.\"\n\nHurray, off to the races, release the built cluster to the client, who deals with their own DB installs and configurations.\n\nTesting is great. Everything works on the internals, the backups, the failover (tested by physically pulling cables and/or killing needed services), all down the line. Client cuts over the production database on a weekend, and it's running full-tilt.\n\nAnd the backups die. The direct-to-host C: drive backups spin along like clockwork, going to the virtual host DB0 fails every time.\n\nWell, piss.\n\nLoop in Dingus tech support, pasting the configuration into the ticket and explaining the situation. Immediately ^(Okay, 24 hours later) they come back taking about how to configure it for virtualization hosts.\n\n~~Tear tech services a new one for their inability to read~~ Explain, again, that's not what we're doing. Sits in queue for two days before I get an email asking if they can close the ticket. Get irked, ask if they've actually done any work on the ticket. Things are getting a bit heated.\n\nThey check a few things ^(Dubious) and report back there's errors on three drives; we need to run CHKDSK /F on all of them, then run SFC /SCANNOW on those three disks.\n\nOkay, we're into total bollocks territory. Did I mention this server is for Big Client's Client, with a 24x7x365 uptime contract?\n\nFortunately, we have a quarterly maintenance window of four glorious hours already scheduled. Unsurprisingly, chkdsk and sfc /scannow are both deliciously clear.\n\nReport back to Dingus.\n\nThey tell me \"that configuration isn't supported\" and a link to the KB. Full stop.\n\n**This aggression will not stand, man!**\n\nRope in my boss, who has a direct line to Dingus's CTO. Tell my boss about my desire to tear them a new one. He tells me, \"Go for it, also email CTO@Dingus and me, to loop everyone in.\"\n\nI escalate, then go back through the Dingus KB to see if I actually missed this.\n\nNo, I didn't. The origination date on the KB was the day ***after*** I got the unequivocal go-ahead from Dingus engineering.\n\nI'm working with senior engineers now, after telling the CTO we're looking at moving this client - and their two devices - to something else if we can't resolve this garbage.\n\nWe're delving into SQL backups to NAS at this point, which is a pain in the ass for faster restoration of a 24x7x365 client who notices every hiccup of their SQL back end servers.\n\nSelah.",

        "text": "**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.\n\n \n\n**$User** - Company employee, calling in for support!\n\n \n\n**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant and indirectly $Selben’s boss. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!\n\n \n\n**$Tech** - The last remaining helpdesk tech.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\nThe office was dimly lit with flickering fluorescent lighting on their last legs as $Selben entered the office and sat at his desk one morning. Putting on his headset he looked up to see four ~~mysterious robed figures~~ technicians all stand in unison and walk out the door ~~drawing twisted blades~~ reaching for cigarettes as they left. During the ten minutes his machine took to load, $Soda arrived, waving as he passed by to his own cubicle.\n\n \n\nRecently all the helpdesk technicians, including all the IT managers, had quit, except for one low level tech who had only been there a month. $Selben and $Soda were brought in on temporary contracts to help until the company got staffing back up to snuff. The other temporary techs were normally internal software devs and were filling in until new people were hired. Unfortunately, this meant they didn’t know much more than $Selben and $Soda about company procedures for the helpdesk. Documentation at this facility was completely lackluster. Almost everything had been tribal knowledge, being passed from technician to technician, making it difficult to troubleshoot internal systems.\n\n \n\nImmediately on making himself available for phone calls, $Selben’s phone rang and he leapt into action!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling $Company, this is $Selben. How can I help you?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: This is $User. Badge reader.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay, let me just get a ticket started.\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Great thanks!\n\n \n\n*Click*\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Hello?\n\n \n\nThe caller had hung up… $Selben began to fill in the ticket, but before he finished another call came in. He scribbled a note to himself to finish after the call. This user had a complex issue that took right up to his 20-minute call goal but managed to finish it at the last moment. He glanced at his note from the previous call, but his phone rang again before he could touch it. This repeated over the next couple hours, including getting several calls from other users who only stated their name, followed by “Badge reader,” before hanging up.\n\n \n\nGetting annoyed by the abrupt calls with no information, he put himself on extended call completion so that he would stop getting calls temporarily and walked over to $Soda’s desk. As he approached he noted the other techs had gone on their fourth smoke break of the day, so it was just the two of them.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Hey $Soda.\n\n \n\n$Soda sighed and put himself on extended call completion.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: What’s up bud?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Have you been getting weird calls about…\n\n \n\n$Soda completed the statement for him.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Badge readers?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Yes!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Indeed, it’s very odd. I was trying to find documentation for it, but there’s nothing. Let’s check with the other guys when they’re back.\n\n \n\nFeeling satisfied there was at least a plan, $Selben headed back to his seat. Before he made it, a random user from the office caught him ~~with a snare and dragged him kicking and screaming from his cubicle~~ and asked he look at something on their computer. It took nearly 30 minutes. The user had managed to unplug and attempt to plug back in their VGA cable upside down. After some pin unbending due to no extra cables in the supply closet, $Selben got it working again ~~and was able to escape with his life~~ and returned to his desk to find chaos unfolding.\n\n \n\nTwo of the four techs were having a yelling match with a company VP, while the other two and $Soda were frantically taking calls. The call queue had blown up—it seemed none of the badge readers were functioning. $Soda finished his call and somehow got everyone to calm down.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Okay $Tech, what did you do in the past when the badge readers stopped working?\n\n \n\nHe quickly got heated again.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Tech: I don’t know! I was never involved, I just created the tickets that they called.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Okay, don't worry, just think. Walk me through a call, would you transfer it or do something else?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Tech: They would call, give their name, and then hang up. I’d then go and look them up to create a ticket and would ask them to call back if they still needed help. They never would. Eventually I would just close the ticket.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Wait wait… Where would you look them up?’\n\n \n\n&gt; $Tech: I opened the badge reader app, logged in and searched for the user to make sure they were there. They always were. Then I’d create a ticket and close the app.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Show me…\n\n \n\nAfter only a minute of $Tech showing him what his process was, $Soda stood up beaming and called out to the $VP.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Hey $VP, if I can fix this issue permanently, will you buy us all gyros from the corner food truck?\n\n \n\n&gt; $VP: Of course! No one else has been able to fix it since we got the readers years ago!\n\n \n\n$Soda opened the badge administrator application and logged in. Quickly selecting all badge readers company wide, he went to their shared settings, and turned off…the sleep timer. He had realized searching for the user woke the badge reader up, causing it to work after the user called in.\n\n\n\nAn hour later, all the techs were happily eating their gyros.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to the length of time this issue had gone on, most users were still repeating the ritual of calling in, stating their name, “Badge Reader,” and hanging up, before even trying to use it. $Soda suggested making a prompt on the tech support phone line for badge readers that would go straight to voice mail and be automatically deleted after a set amount of time, and $Selben was asked to implement it. $Soda and $Selben received more gyros for this as well.",

Still, the impatience of one of our managers was just a bit too much.\n\n\nKey Participants:\n\n\n**$Me**: Disappointed Author\n\n\n**$SV**: My direct supervisor\n\n\n**$MG**: A second-level manager at my workplace\n\n\n**$EA**: Executive Assistant\n\n\nRewind to yesterday, and I get an instant message from boss:\n\n\n&gt;**$SV**: **$MG** will be coming over there in a bit to ask you to update a map. It shouldn't be a big deal.\n\n\nThis reality never materialized, and with us down about 20-25% of our staff, I wasn't about to go looking for extra work. It's been finding me plenty of late, thank you.\n\n\nNow we're at today, and I overhear **$MG** talking to **$SV** about this map, wondering what came of it. **$MG** then comes over to ask me.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: **$SV** asked you yesterday about updating our map, did you do that?\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**: No, he told me that you would be coming to talk to me about it, but you never did.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: Oh, I thought he was going to.\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**, What do you need done? It should only take a couple of minutes.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: We need to reassign one of the territories from one person to the other.\n\n\nSide note: The map marks territories from some traveling employees. There are only four, meaning four colors. What was being asked is that I open Paint and use the fill bucket to change one are from one color to the other. We've had issues in the past where users don't make updates to master copies of documents (instead keeping their own, updated copies and leaving the master files out of date), so IT has basically decided we'll handle anything that acts as official work documentation to avoid these mishaps.\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**: Oh, sure, that'll just take a second...done\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: Great, can you print me 5 copies for a meeting tomorrow and e-mail it to **$EA** to send to everyone here?\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**: Yeah, let's go grab these off the color printer and make sure they came out OK\n\n\nYeah, I have a tendency to make sure color print outs come off OK, as our color printer can be difficult...which it was.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: Looks good, thanks.\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**, staring at the paper he's holding: Wait, why is that blue? It should be gray, but it's come out about the same blue as the other part. Let me get rid of those and try to fix it, it might be a bit.\n\n\nI tried reprinting, and it just got worse. The gray went back to gray, but a red hue was spread across the pages. I decided to send off the e-mail before I forgot, then I would deal with the printer.\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**, via e-mail: **$EA**, here is the map **$MG** requested. Don't let anyone print it for a while, the color printer is being difficult.\n\n\n&gt;**$EA**, in an e-mail to all staff: Please see the attached update to the staff map. The only change is the reassignment of one territory. **$Me** advises that the color printer is being difficult right now, so please avoid printing color copies for a little bit while he tries to sort it out.\n\n\nNot 2 minutes later, **$MG** has caught up to me as I head back to attempt number 3 on fixing this dumb thing.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: Hey, how are those print outs coming?\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**: I haven't figured out the printer, I told **$EA** to make sure no one uses it for a bit.\n\n\n&gt;**$MG**: Oh, well, I didn't read it, I just sent a copy for myself to the printer.\n\n\n&gt;**$Me**, to myself, dying inside: Are you kidding me? It's been, like, 20 seconds.\n\n\nManagement has now deemed e-mails with two lines of text (totaling 3 sentences) too much of a hassle to actually read. His print out didn't come out right either, so I had to toss it with the rest of them. It turned out the magenta cartridge was faulty and just kept smearing toner across pages.\n\n\nFinal note: Never try to clean off a magenta toner cartridge with compressed air. Your arm will turn a little pink.",

Namely, the \"return your computer, you're too dumb to own one\" category. \n\nNow, the ticket itself was innocent enough: \n\n&gt; 07:30 AM: Computer dead, monitors dead, laptop is working. Need new computer. Please assist ASAP at Room 313, 3rd floor, building F.\n\n\nEager to show my skills, this being a new job and all, I assigned the ticket to me and got on my way, all over to the other side of the compound to building F. \n\n\nAnd I could. Not. find the room. It simply did not exist in the hallway in the 3rd floor. Error 404, room not found.\n\nBut as Lady Fortune would have it, I happened to stumble upon one of the janitors, who could tell me that the room was not on the 3rd floor, it was most likely room 213, which was on the 2nd floor. Sounded reasonable, it could be a simple typo.. Twice.\n\nAnd then he mentions that he had just replaced a fuse on that floor and that the section of the floor that room was located at, had been without power the entire morning.\n\n\nSo.. We go and check. Yep, the room seems to be the correct one, username checks out, it's right there on one of the aforementioned monitors. That was supposedly dead. Connected to the supposedly dead computer.\nAnd the laptop? Of course it would work, it was docked, but they had only keyboard and mouse connected to it and it was connected to the wifi, so it was working like a champ.\n\n\nI had to ask the janitor once more if *all* the power in this section had been gone, which he confirmed. No power, which meant no lights, no running computers, nothing that would require a constant power supply to work, would be running.\n\n\nIt was a case that resolved itself, but you have to wonder: How can you, after having walked through the dark hallways, where the only source of lights would be the emergency escape lights, enter your office, be unable to turn on the lights, then find that you're unable to turn on your computer or monitors, use the laptop to report to the IT department.. That your computer is not working and that you need a replacement?\n\n\nWas my very first case ever that I had to close with both errorcodes #ID-10-T and #PEBKAC.",

A big troubling mistake that cost me dearly both in time and my own sanity. I said yes...\n\n##The Fallout\n\nIt was a Wednesday morning. Minding my own business I was doing my thing debugging something relatively uninteresting when $boss walks up to my desk:\n&gt;You know $luesterklemme, you seem to like this IT stuff and since one of the guys caring for it left and the other doesn't seem to be too interested, maybe you should do it.\n\nDumbfounded I stared blankly in his general direction thinking of AT-commands.\n&gt;Uhm, yes?\n\nThinking of ordering gadgets and keeping the engineering grunts happy (all power users, seemingly capable), maybe fiddling with an Exchange server, I didn't seem to grasp the momentousness of that reply.\n\n&gt; Sure I can do it. What exactly is \"it\", anyway?\n\n$boss lightens up.\n&gt; Not much, really. Hardware for the developers, printers, whatever, maybe a bit of financial planning, keeping the servers running. Simple stuff...\n\nServers?  \nPlural?  \nI didn't even know we had one on premise. Let alone multiple. Ok that could be interesting.\n\n&gt; Hm, I will need a bit to get an overview and come back to you when things need to be done.\n\n$boss already on his way to the coffee machine:\n\n&gt; Yeah, sure. Take your time. The guys who did it so far didn't spend much time with it either, so it should be no biggie.\n\nRed flags waving in front of my eyes I finished my debugging and started my quest in the search of the office servers.  \nSince it was an open plan office, there was not much room to hide away servers. The meeting rooms and the lab were devoid of anything remotely looking like a server, \nthere were no maintenance rooms or even a server room to be searched but I was told somewhere hidden away in a far corner the \"storage room\" could hold the \nfaibled thing I was looking for. The inclined reader may now picture a room so small and cramped that the door needed to be opened carefully not to disturb the \ncarefully established equilibrium of papers and ancient archives. \nUpon entry a hellish blaze of dry heat flushed my face and somewhere beneath all the dead tree sheets and shelves a faint whirring noise could be heard. \n\n\n##The little server that could\n\nAs if Gandalf and his dwarven friends I stirred the lair of ~~Smaug the server and was stunned in awe and shock. That little server was there under heaps of stuff and did its thing uneventful and unnoticed for years. \nFans whirring away it sat on the ground hooked up to an old UPS (lights blinking - battery dead) next to another small server hooked up to the same UPS. \nConnecting a monitor I was greeted with the all familiar log-in screen of Windows XP (or in this case Windows Server 2003) at that point out of support but that didn't matter since there was a backlog of 200-odd updates waiting for the next reboot. \nThat thing did everything from file server, AD, print server, mail you name it and was out on the very last limb. The little Linux server next to it was of no concern since it was pretty much just experimental stuff but shutting it off would have hurt nonetheless.\nSo I scuttled back to my desk and worked on something different and tried to forget what I had just seen.\n\n##Confrontation\n\nThe next day $boss came by\n&gt; So what do you say? All fine whith the server?\n\n&gt; If it was a horse I would drag it past the barn and shoot it. \n \n$boss stood there dumbfounded.\n\n&gt; That sounds bad. Do we need to order parts? More RAM? HDD? We will need to see what we can do. Can you compile a list so we can talk about it? (Translation: Ignore it)\n\n&gt; That won't help I'm afraid. That room is not suitable for a server or in fact for any electronics at all. There is just too much stuff crammed in there - everything flammable I might add. And I wouldn't be surprised if two hobbits came along with a ring and try to throw it in there. That server is past its time and the software won't get updates. UPS is quite possibly dead and it's a bad design from the beginning. So the only point on the list would be: Everything.\n\n&gt; Be reasonable, we can't just buy a new server. Too much money and time. \n\n&gt; Ok then I'm on my way to the \"server room\" and test the UPS since I am in charge of the equitment now. You might want to have a look what happens when I pull the plug. Also you might want to write an E-mail to corporate before you can't anymore that the whole office is not getting any work done for the next couple of hours if we are lucky or weeks if the server dies with the UPS.\n\n$boss with a slight hint of panic in his voice stammered something about net losses and working hours and went on his merry way and I started browsing what to get as a replacement server. \n\n\n",

So, here goes - The Story of the Broken Password! \n\n\n\"Welcome to IT-Service Desk, how can I...\"\n\n\"One of you did something to my password!\"\n\n*Interrupter. I love interrupters as much as I love bed bugs and pishmires...*\n\n\"Excuse me, Ms..?\"\n\n\"Yes, hello! I had my password expire, so I called you guys, and one of your colleagues did something to it, and now it doesn't work!\"\n\n*Wrap my head around how she thinks her password is a physical constant that you can \"do things\" to...*\n\n\"Well... All right. Can I have your user-ID, please?\"\n\n\"Is that my login? Because my login doesn't work!\"\n\n\"Um, well, your user-ID - or username - won't be, um, *damaged*, and I need it to check who you are in our system and to reset your password.\"\n\n\"That's what he said! 'Reset it', he said to me, and then after he did, my password didn't work!\"\n\n*Check her ID and verify her name. Her account has been locked out. Too many tries, most likely. I take her number and tell her I'll call back. I breathe deeply, reset the password to something easy and call her back.*\n\n\"Hi, it's UnintentionalAss, from IT, and I'm calling with your new password. Are you by your computer, so that we can make sure it works this time?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sitting here...\" *She doesn't sound happy. Not one bit.* \"...but I'm at the wrong screen!\"\n\n\"At... The wrong screen..?\"\n\n\"Yes. There's two screens on my computer, and it's much better to call IT-Service Desk when you're on the other screen!\"\n\n*Mute to take a deeep breath, so that I can wrap my head around how she thinks it will actually make any sort of difference which monitor she's on - and the fact that she refers to them as being 'on' her computer.*\n\n\"All right, then - you just have to click and hold your mouse pointer at the top of the CertainWebEnvironment-window and pull it across to the other monitor.\" \n\n\"Monitor...\" she mumbles.\n\n\"The other screen...\" \n\n“I know that!”\n\n*I doubt that she knows that. I hear her click and pull and really make an effort to move her window, for some inexplicable reason only she knows.* \n\n\"Shall we try again?\"\n\n\"Yes, we can try.\"\n\n*I give her the password. It's a normal word. An easy word. Yet, she manages to do it wrong some way.*\n\n\"No, you see?? It didn't work this time either! One of you did something to my WebEnvironment!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I can assure you, one of us did not damage your WebEnvironment in any way, and my password should work. Would you be willing to try again, please?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll try again - but there's something wrong, I'm telling you!\"\n\n*I spell the password out to her, again, very slowly. Yet, there's still a problem somewhere - and if I could take a wild guess...*\n\n\"Ma'am, would you please make sure it says 'DOMAIN' and a backslash before your username?\"\n\n\"Slash?\"\n\n\"Backslash.\"\n\n\"Which one is backslash?\"\n\n\"Well, it's the slash that goes the other way, backwards, towards the name. It's right next to 'Shift' - the thicker upwards-pointing arrow.\"\n\n*She struggles. Oh, how she struggles, but it just won't work.*\n\n\"No, there's a backslash, but it doesn't work, because the password is wrong!\"\n\n*I start a remote session of WebEnvironment. I put in her username. I put in my normal, super easy password. It works just fine.*\n\n\"Ma'am, now I have started a remote session of WebEnvironment, and I used your credentials to login. It works just fine on my end, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't on yours.”\n\n*She huffs, presumably getting an ulcer at the sound of all these unfamiliar words I try to use as diplomatically as possible. I have to try again.*\n\n“Are you sitting at your work computer?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm at work!\"\n\n\"Could you log into your computer with this password?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n*I rub my temples, confused beyond reason.*\n\n\"Then... How are you logging onto WebEnvironment?\"\n\n\"But that's what I can't do!\"\n\n\"No, I mean: how are you on the computer if your System-password doesn't work?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I just didn't log in! WebEnvironment is the first thing I log into!\"\n\n\"All right...\"\n\n*I think. Man, do I think. I think until my scull hurts. Then, I take a wild guess, and I leap.*\n\n\"Ma'am, will you do me a favour, please? Will you check at the very left on your keyboard? There should be a sort of half-big button there, with the words 'Caps Lock' written on it.\"\n\n*She goes from angry to furious, because this one, she's heard before.*\n\n\"I HAVEN'T PRESSED CAPS LOCK! IT JUST ISN'T WORKING! I CALLED YOU TO HELP ME, NOT TO BE A JERK!\"\n\n*Suddenly, she's silent. Oh God, what a beautiful silence. I hear a click. She mumbles something. I hear, to my delight, a co-worker of hers chuckle from the distant Dark Abyss of Ignorance. I wait a few seconds. She types on her keyboard.*\n\n\"Ma'am..? Did you press Caps Lock?\"\n\n*She grunts. She grunts a beautifully shameful, annoyed grunt.*\n\n\"No, I didn't! I hadn't pressed it at all, but it works fine now! It fixed itself! Bye!\"\n\n*She abruptly and angrily hangs up. I shed a joyful tear. It's finally over...*\n\n",

        "text": "So this was years ago, back in 2001, and I was working for a company that was riding the wave of capital, just before the dot.com crash.  I was tasked with going and checking all the data jacks under the cubicles and desks in a vacant part of the building that had been occupied, but we were making plans to expand back into.  Tedious work.  All of the cubicles had no chairs, as they had been been cannibalized to other parts of the building.  The only things remaining were the cubicles, the office chair mats, and the occasional piece of office equipment that had somehow been left behind.  So I get work, and start testing the ports.  I walk up to the desk, drop down on all fours, and crawl under it to connect the network scanner.  I'm a big guy, and I can get my work done, but after crawling under 20 or so desks, you start getting tired, and a little unobservant.  So I go walking up to my 24th or 25th desk of the day, and just like I've already done a hundred times, I drop down an all fours onto the chair mat.\n\nSomeone had turned the chair mat over.\n\nYou remember that scene in Terminator 2? When Arnie throws the biker in the bar and he lands on the stove?  And he's just struggling to get off it, but all he can do is keep burning himself?  Yeah.  About 3-4 really good puncture wounds in each hand, not to mention the myriad of smaller, bruised pinpoints.  But my knees got it the worst.  Said goodbye to those pants.  I finally did what the biker did and just kind of rolled off to the side of the mat, onto the empty floor and laid there, growling and swearing over and over.  It took me a looong time to get up, and finally did so, but figuring out the logistics of getting up from a supine position, without using your hands or knees is quite the challenge, let me tell ya.\n\nSo anyway, that's my story.  A little self-deprecating, but if I got a laugh out of ya, I guess I can say it was worth it.  Now.",

So as of yesterday renovations for the building next to our office has finished and we were tasked with *JUST* moving computers and periphery from each employees temp office to the finished ones. Of course you and I know it's never just computers and periphery. Anyway, everyone got different desks, some were not put together, others were but they weren't optimal for any computer (no outlet holes to plug stuff in) and of course all day we were having to work around users wanting to arrange the room in such a way that they ignore outlets, ports and the like. Then they pitch a fit about cords running across the room. Then there was one guy in particular that had us arrange everything just so, routing all his cables through this 2x1 inch hole in the back of the desk. Basically it took forever and a day to get it wired. Then when we finished, he bitched about the printer cable running around the room (he insisted the printer be on the far side of the room away from him because it is loud) then he decided the tower needed to be on the outside portion of the desk so we had to undo everything and redo it around the desk. \n\n\nTHEN around the time we got done with the 4th ot 5th person we start to realize no ones phones were working so I tell them I will address it soon. Finish with the moving and I check with my boss, he confirms what I think we need to do as I have done it before, recently. I grab a notepad and pen and start taking down port numbers in every office and carrying a phone around to test them. All but maybe 3 work. I get to the 3rd floor, maybe 3 offices away and run into our unit director, he asks what we are doing, we tell him. He chuckles and says \"Didnt you see the e-mail? [Administrative support lady] sent one about the phones. No one has come out from [Main IT Unit] to turn the ports on.\" I tell him no, when and to whom was this sent? He tells me it was sent around 1 (while I was moving computers and therefore unable to check email) and it was sent to the mailing list that included department directors, associate directors, certain other high up people that I am unsure what their job is  and the lead developers. NOT tech support. NOT computing coordinators. NOT anyone I would have bumped into today save for him. \n\nThis is one of those \"of course they didnt, why would I have expected them to\" moments but man it was a shit show.",

Let's talk.\n\nToday, 22:30. I (Director of IT, department of one guy) had just gotten off the phone with my boss (CTO). He's been 'assaulted' by a lot recently, from an entire building getting renovated meaning he just had to tell and help some poor blokes (me included), that we need to move a few tons of misc TV equipment by hand three floors down, then two up, between two buildings. Also about how our main antenna aircon is failing and we drop broadcast (note, this concerns a TV station/channel workplace) every once in a while. A lot more, but in short, tiles falling under him from everywhere, but nothing really came close to what i just had to tell him:\n\n&gt; $Cosmitz: \"The entire production fileserver is unrecoverably dead.\"\n\n\n&gt; $bossCTO: \"...\"\n\n---------\n\nFlashback time. We had an install of a massive system a while back, three or so years. That install [took away my best friend which i was working with](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3k8zhh/not_your_average_tfts/) at the time. It was a massive tape-to-digital as well as SD-to-HD conversion plus a Media Asset Management system which was followed by a glacial post-install support. \n\nThat support ran for a stated three years or so, in short, everything had ended at the beginning of this month. That included all our broadcast servers, all our production equipment, all the licence support, and generally everything you would think as being mission-critical to a well-running media company. My boss and I have had a lot of discussions about this impending scenario. We knew we wouldn't get financed for a complete package for another two years, which ran up to 150.000 euros, and we started to hack it apart. Figure out backups, what we could live without if something just up and died, something that has been known to happen, especially to our company. In our discussions, we sliced it down to something trivial in price, but apparently it wasn't enough anyway and we didn't get anything. We've noticed more and more cutbacks everywhere, and we were told to 'deal with what we have'. Ours is a sort of a little crooked tentacle in a bigger mess of a megalithic organisation so sometimes, especially with the massive renovation project going on next door out of the same common 'wallet', we can sometimes get pushed aside as non-important.\n\nI knew the corporate structure and economics of where i was employed, so i got to work.\n\nI made a ton of documents showing procedures, workflows, ways stuff could work if X or Y becomes unrecoverable. Legit a few weeks of work. I had also made one for 'production server dies' and in it i wrote a few phrases akin to: 'It's not worth discussing what happens if the production server dies and we don't have any lifelines. If it drops dead, we'll each just go home and get piss drunk and hope the matter goes away in the morning by pure unicorn magic'.\n\n--------\n\nTechnically, today was 22 days past the support cut-off date. Practically, it was something nearer to 45ish days on this particular equipment due to our reseller skimping out on some details. It didn't matter for the people i had emailed today for support.\n\nThe matter started out with a damaged RAID array, but without any faulty drives reported. After troubleshooting what is an ultra-closed system where the only thing i could really fiddle with was their webgui backend which didn't feature any user-initated rebuilds, i decided to give it a restart with the consensus of the CTO hoping to see some statistics from the RAID controller as it booted up. It really wasn't a big deal. Except when the machine didn't start again. Filled with kernel panic errors of varying casues depending on which restart you were on, no backup disks or even a possibility of using such since, again, an ultra-closed system... i just had to make the call.\n\n&gt; $Cosmitz: \"The entire production fileserver is unrecoverably dead.\"\n\n\n&gt; $bossCTO: \"...\"\n\n&gt; $Cosmitz: \"The data should be fine, that's not a problem, however this isn't something they can just remote in and fix even IF they wanted to, and even if we somehow managed to summon up a few thousand euros just to pay for a one year support plan just exactly for this one machine, that'd still imply flying someone out most likely for a few days of work, plus a whole new machine under-arm which we may need to pay extra for.\"\n\n&gt; $bossCTO: \"What does this mean realistically for us?\"\n\n&gt; $Cosmitz: \"No production at all, everyone can go on vacation for as much as it matters. There are no heroics here to do, no medals to win or statues to get built if we could pull this out of our asses, since we can't. MCR (main control room) will just have to deal with whatever material they already have on the smaller storage machine, just to keep us from dropping to black.\"\n\n&gt; $bossCTO: \"I see. Be seeing you tomorrow in the morning and we'll figure what we can do.\"\n\n&gt; $Cosmitz: \"Unless we pay these guys, ASAP, that's the situation, and even then... we'll have more downtime than anyone high up is comfortable with.\"\n\nWe both closed the call without saying goodbye. We both knew it. We were in the Apocalypse scenario.\n\n---------\n\nThat was roughly an hour and a half ago, before the shots and my tapping this out here more to get it out of my system.\n\nSo yeah, this story ain't over yet but i'm reasonably certain things may happen as a result to this. Including our entire station just getting the axe instead of having to deal with the economic investment from up-high, especially right now in a very unfavorable climate for the organisation. We can squeeze this for a month or so, maybe i can perform some necromancy on older equipment and jockstrap it together, but the moment we need to roll out any sort of heavier production past just the daily news, which will be a feat on its own, we're done.\n\nHere's hoping some unicorns are feeling glittery tonight.\n\n----------\n\ntl;dr: sometimes the worst just happens, and all you can realistically do is sit back and watch it burn.",

Let's call her PL for Password Lady.\n\n&gt;$PL: I don't have any of my bookmarks, and all of my passwords were stored in the AutoFill of Safari. I literally don't know any of my passwords!\n\nI literally didn't know what to say to that and was silent for a bit.\n\n&gt;$Me: Well, I can export your bookmarks from your old hard drive and re-import them, but I can't promise I can get your autofill restored.\n\nSure enough, even after restoring bookmarks there was no autofill. I then remembered Keychain and found the old keychain from her hard drive, and switched out keychain files in the library (I didn't overwrite the current keychain). After doing that, Safari was asking for a keychain password. She tried her login password, and it didn't work. She then verified that her old computer login was the same as the one she was entering, and tried a few things. I explained to her that if she changed her password on her laptop at some point, and the keychain wasn't updated, then it wasn't updated with the password she was entering. Surprisingly, she accepted this and didn't try to shift the blame to me for not remembering her passwords. I switched the keychain files back and logged off her computer.",

        "text": "Well here I am once again with another tech support story from the call center of insanity. In this case the support came from inside the center instead of over the phone. Let's introduce our cast of characters\n\n$Me: A Strapping used-to-be young lad running short of leash and shorter of patience\n\n$TempLead: The poor but awesome colleague that is at the same level as our hero, but as our 'fearless leader' is on vacation is responsible for all of us and anything we've been dealing with.\n\n\nTo set the stage a little, After July 4th it almost felt like the signal fire for the masses that are being supported by the small queue of a few good men. The phones began to light up the next day, and every day since only proceeded to light up further and faster as many tech issues, both old and tired, and new and confusing began to pop up. Our band of heroes continued to fight valiantly by the day however by the third week it has become exhausting, and unfortunately the latest volley of calls came with an unexpected problem. \n\nAs our Hero came in for the week, drunk with the liquor of a calm weekend and feeling calm and happy he would only take a moment to look at the battlefield board. Already the signs were showing of another long day and fights and issues with numbers reaching high and flashing colors of red indicating the urgency. \n\nWith massive strength of will our quickly started to brew a cup of his finest caffeinated brew and began to arm himself with his systems getting ready to tackle the day once again, but suddenly tragedy struck banishing the wistful dream he was having bringing the cold hard reality that he was a phone jock in a call center to view. Try as he might, he could not connect his system to the network.\n\nAs our Hero questioned what was occurring, thinking it might be something small and simple he tried running the basics. Unplugging and replugging the network, checking the IP, rebooting the system. All for naught. Confusion caught on as suddenly the ruling party came and provided info for the woes\n\n$TempLead: Swap the cables around. The network isn't working in one port and swapping seems to help a little letting us connect to the network we need to support.\n\nYes, instead of the outage coming from outside the walls, we were now in the midst of our own outage, and it was plain to see that if this did not get a workaround soon we would be even more hobbled to the volley of issues soon to hit.\n\nQuickly our hero started to look into this. Trying releasing IP's and flushing DNS with no results. When our hero started to pull up a few things to generate errors, he noticed suddenly that for some odd reason sites with HTTPS would not work, but those that did not contain it would come up.\n\nCurious indeed.\n\nHe quickly reported this to to $Templead who puzzled at this as well. Suddenly inspiration struck. He saw something while the system was bouncing connections in the ip release. It made no sense, but maybe something with no sense can work in this place of chaos.\n\nQuickly going back to his system he remembered seeing a wifi signal for a brief moment, and disconnected his network. He waited with baited breath for a minute, and then suddenly it connected and bells rang glorifying in network connectivity. There was a hidden wifi, never told to the basement dwellers, that was also part of the network and it worked. Quickly he tested and found everything working, and spread the word crying out happiness and hope to all. Except for the one person who was on a tower system with no wifi. They decided to use a longer cord to plug him into another working port in another cube.\n\nHe announced his triumph to the $TempLead, who groaned his frustrations at the Emperor wondering why we were trying to fix out network issues instead of fixing calls. Still the $Hero felt the buzz of actually doing real tech work, and started to feel inclined he might need a job change.\n\nA few hours later the workaround is still being used, but it was found the DNS had been corrupted to the wrong location. Fixes have been made, but still the network continues to fail.\n\nTL;DR: Network goes halfway down while working with another company who's network is having issues. Apparently systems all have a wifi configuration we were never notified about that works, which helped when everything started to break on the other company's side\n\n(Sorry if the grammer goes all over the place. Had to type this between calls)",

        "text": "An [earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/910cmc/plug_things_inprinters_dont_break_computers/) reminded me of something I ran into back a few years before I was a paid IT whipping boy.\n\nBack in the mid '90s my dad bought a new PC for home business work.  Since I was already pretty experienced with Wintel hardware, he handed it over to me when it arrived to set everything up.  Things were running smoothly, but they went horribly wrong when I plugged the printer in to install the drivers.  The screen went black, everything stopped responding, and nothing happened when I hit the power button.  I didn't smell any magic smoke but that machine was hopelessly dead.  I didn't think I did anything wrong, though I was still a bit freaked out.  I told my dad about it, and ended up calling the company's tech support.  The guy I talked to was cool about things, but we were stumped.  After some back and forth, they wanted us to pack the machine up and send it back.\n\nAfter hanging up, I had a sudden thought that I thought I'd investigate.  This computer was still in the AT hardware era where the peripherals (serial and parallel) use ribbon cables bolted to the case's backplane, rather than built into the board.  I removed the screws and confirmed my suspicion.  The internal parallel cable had a non-molded plastic shield that was easy to remove and expose the pins.  There was a defective solder joint that was bridging two of the pins.  So apparently with nothing plugged in, the bridge was harmless but attaching the printer destroyed the motherboard.\n\nThe damage was already done, but I was able to fix the connector.  I called support back and explained exactly what I'd found.  I'm not sure the guy was pleased with me tinkering around inside, but I was able to get him to just send a replacement motherboard so I could swap it out.  The operation was a success, the computer had many good years of life, and the printer was no longer homicidal.  I have a suspicion that if I'd sent the PC back, they would have just replaced the board and sent it back, and it would self-destruct again if I'd tried to plug the printer again without identifying the problem.\n\nLesson learned:  Whenever I encountered peripheral ribbon cables I made a habit of always checking them for defective solder joints.",
