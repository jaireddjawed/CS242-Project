They shouldn’t be beholden to their respective political parties, whether Democratic or Republican. In this way, you would see decisions that shock their own political party, because they’re above political partisanship and are making decisions consistent to their own thinking and almost predictable over time. \n\nAre we seeing hyper partisanship creeping into Supreme Court decisions? Basically if you have the majority vote, all decisions will favor not a conservatism or liberalism, constitutional expansionism or originalism, but whatever decision currently benefits their respective political party at the time? Are we seeing a Supreme Court that is nakedly biased and partisan, and just an extended arm of whatever political party holds the court at the time?",

He declined to identify the charges or prosecution targets the panel is considering for criminal referrals.\n\nThroughout the committee’s proceedings, members have made clear they hold Trump responsible for inciting the attack on the Capitol in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nWitnesses who’ve been interviewed by the panel include presidential staff and lawyers as well as law enforcement officers and others who testified to what was going on in the White House as hundreds of rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to stop the US House from certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe charges may include perjury, Thompson said, also without providing any details. “Well, that’s part of the discussion. Yeah,” he said. Among other potential charges are criminal contempt of Congress, obstruction of justice, obstruction of an official government proceeding and conspiracy.\n\nGarland last month appointed a special prosecutor, John L. “Jack” Smith, to oversee investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol — including any role Trump may have played — as well as the former president’s handling of classified White House records after he left office.\n\nMore than 900 people have been arrested for taking part in the assault. Of those, more than half have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial.\n\nIs it likely Trump is specifically included in the criminal referral as a target?",
