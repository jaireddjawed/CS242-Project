It was originally an anesthesia attending who told me he only works at 80% and feels way happier, but he also said that anesthesia is shift work so it is more conducive to that kind of thing. I'm definitely not set on anesthesia or anything but this put it pretty high up on my list since I think it is pretty cool anyway. \n\nBasically, I am looking for a non-surgical specialty that works close to normal office hours and allows flexibility for scaling back, possibly for multiple years at a time or indefinitely.\n\nWhat specialties would be good for this kind of voluntary scale back (with a proportional pay cut I assume)? For context, I'm hoping to end up at a large medical center. For the fields that are good for this kind of thing, can you maintain a scale back for multiple years or do admins try to get you back up to 100% pretty fast? \n\nThanks!

This semester, our school is doing this thing where they bring in a hyperspecialized expert for every single topic and subtopic that we learn about. In pathology alone we have 14 professors and none of them teach more than 3 or 4 consecutive lectures. The problem is that they have no idea what we already know and dont know as med students. One prof told us to memorize which vasculitidies were P‐ANCA/C-ANCA before a different prof finally told us what ANCA is. We're told to memorize the spinal levels involved in DTRs but every professor tells us slightly different levels. Some of these people absolutely suck at teaching and don't belong in a classroom while some are amazing teachers but only get to do 1 lecture. Collectively I feel like the patchwork of professors in leaving gaps in my medical knowlege that I need filled to pass step1. My school is also graded preclinicals so I can't just go for a bare minimum pass and study first aid.\n\nDo any other schools do it this way?",

I also just have this thing where I lean into self-deprecation too much in order to connect with people but it just backfires on me because people start taking it as permission to bring up my mistakes too. I also just don't project confidence and self-assuredness like a lot of people in my class (and some of my friends) do. \n\nNow I just feel condescended all the time and people just don't seem to take me seriously ever. If someone asks a question and I answer it, they won't take it seriously as the right answer until someone else says the same thing. If I'm in cadaver lab with a group of people, they will disregard me when I say something. I don't think they even realize they're doing it - it's just that they've subconsciously decided I'm stupid and have me categorized that way. I want to prove them wrong and show them I can be a really good student who knows what they're talking about but a part of me think they're right and I'm actually an idiot. \n\nI know no one can make me feel anything I don't want to and I'm probably projecting my own insecurities too but this is actually crushing me a little bit.",

Should I take a chill elective the month before submitting ERAS so that I have time to research programs, write essays and clean up my ERAS application and handle edits and etc.\n\nOr should I do a second away rotation? \n\nOne one hand I think having that month allows me to ensure my PS are personalized for top programs I want to go into and that there are no typos or errors and ensures my application is in tip top shape. This would hypothetically boost my chances are all residency programs.\n\nOn the other hand, I could do an away and increase my chance at one program.

My psychologist said that it’s going to take me time to process what happened. Apparently I’m subconsciously processing, even when I don’t realize it, and that’s taking up my bandwidth for motivation and focus.\n\nI’m not failing, but I’m falling behind rapidly in school, and I wouldn’t be surprised if I did start failing soon. I really don’t know what to do, because I’m getting all the help I can get, but it’s still not working for me.\n\nI have no motivation to study anymore. I know I have to just push through it, but I can’t do it. Does anyone have some advice for pushing through?",
