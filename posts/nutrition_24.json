I would imagine that the bioavailability of plant sources of Zinc (e.g. pumpkin seeds) would be lower but what about non-plant foods?\n\ne.g. 20g of canned oysters equates to approximately 20mg of Zinc, but how much of the 20mg is actually used by the body? \n\nIf the bioavailability from food is less than 100%, should you only count the (approximate) absorbed part towards your daily Zinc count? e.g. if you use a Zinc Picolinate 50 mg tablet, your body may only get about 20% of that zinc for use by your cells and so would only count for approx 10mg?",

        "text": "I recently came across a diet/lifestyle based on nuts and fruits that does not involve any cooking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5jWoC_CXQ) (it's not in English).\n\nHere's my notes/summary:\n\n \n\n* Wake up at 4 am.\n* Do meditation and yoga.\n* Drink water twice before 10 am.\n* 300 ml of mango juice at 10 am. Drink slowly sipping it for 10 - 15 min.\n* Eat twice a day. Diet consists of  \n   * Seeds/nuts\n   * Fruits or dry fruits\n* Between 11 am to 12 pm, have **lunch**:  \n   * raw peanuts\n   * tender coconut 1 cup. If this is not available, substitute with a dry nut\n   * soaked (if possible) nuts mixed with ripe dates:  \n      * 4 to 5 macadamia nuts\n      * 2 brazil nuts\n      * 6 hazelnuts\n      * pinenuts\n   * 2 dried figs (sometimes)\n   * seasonal fruits like guava\n* A glass of coconut water at 4:30 pm.\n* **Dinner** at 5 pm (finish before 6:30 pm):  \n   * pumpkin seeds - soaked\n   * sunflower seeds - soaked\n   * 25 almonds - soaked\n   * pistachios - soaked\n   * blackberries\n   * blueberries\n   * long dry grapes (raisins)\n   * 4 to 5 prunes\n   * 2 apricots\n   * 1 fruit\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitarianism) says:\n\n&gt;Fruitarianism is a diet related to veganism that consists primarily of consuming fruits and possibly nuts and seeds, but without any animal products. Fruitarian diets are subject to criticism and health concerns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;…A fruitarian diet may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as reduced intake of vitamin B12, calcium, iron, zinc, omega-3 or protein.\n\nSo my question is, does Dr. Manthena's method in the linked video address the above concern of nutritional deficiencies?\n\nThere are several negative comments to his video but they are about how expensive this \"sage diet\" is.\n\nThanks in advance.",
