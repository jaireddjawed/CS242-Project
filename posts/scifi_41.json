One the one leg that was a very concerning state of events for the complication plagued research station. On every other leg, Human Friend Ellen had worked with the Trisk for more than long enough to know and respect their taboos on interrupting. However as she slung her leg over the bench her bi-focal gaze was fixed grimly on the tablet she had dropped on the surface. Grs’tkr mimicked a sigh to the best of his ability and took the situation in his gripping appendages.\n\n“We would appreciate the details of that statement,” Grs’tkr said.\n\n“It’s the grains for the fluffel bums,” Human Friend Ellen said. “A silicate fungus got past the quarantine somehow. Seventh Sister discovered it while it was still in quarantine so it hasn’t affected our existing stores but we don’t dare use any of the shipment now. It’s jumped three bulkheads that we’ve seen so we have to assume that the whole shipment is contaminated.”\n\nThe table fell into silence as the gathered agricultural experts considered this. Half of them were clearly bristling at Human Friend Ellen’s rudeness. Finally Grs’tkr spoke.\n\n“Human Friend Ellen,” he said in careful tones, “I have a question.”\n\n“No, we can’t feed it to the fluffel bums anyway,” she interjected. “The fungus won’t kill them but the build up over time will cause impaction in their guts.”\n\n“But Human Friend Ellen,” Grs’tkr tried again.\n\n“And we could try sprouting the so-far-untouched grains but we think that will only increase the growth rate for the fungus,”  Human Friend Ellen went on.\n\nThe gathered Trisk waited for her to gather her thoughts, watching her will all of their forward facing eyes. Humans really were a force of nature. Nothing stopped them.  Finally Grs’tkr spoke, firmly and quickly.\n\n“Human Friend Ellen! What is a fluffel bum?” he demanded.\n\n“Huh?” Human Friend Ellen stared at him and blinked a few times.\n\n“What is a fluffel bum?” Grs’tkr asked.\n\n“You know,” Human Friend Ellen said with a vague wave in the direction of the coops. “The chickens.”\n\n“If you meant the chickens,” Grs’tkr said carefully, “why did you call them fluffel bums?”\n\n“Just look at ‘em,” Human Friend Ellen said, her face spreading into a grin. “Their bums are like seventy percent fluff!”\n\nThe Trisk continued to stare at her waiting for explanation, but her eyes had dropped down to the tablet and she began muttering to herself about desiccants and grain yield.\n\n##  [Please go and leave a new rating and review on my 3rd book! ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPHYPLG1)\n\n## [Amazon! ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)[Barnes &amp; Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Betty%20Adams%22;jsessionid=CEE1DC5396DEB62D43FEFC724630F686.prodny_store02-atgap01?Ntk=P_key_Contributor_List&amp;Ns=P_Sales_Rank&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)[Powell's Book](https://www.powells.com/book/humans-are-weird-9798588913683?partnerid=32322)[Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/author?id=Betty+Adams)[Kobo By Rakuten](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans+are+Weird)[Signed First Edition Copy!](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1bpv4akgc65a1.gif",

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 10th, 2022\n\nImagine that you’re Barack Obama and you’ve just won your first presidential election.  It’s election night, the results are in, and you’re buzzing.  How long do you keep feeling that way?  All night for sure.  And I bet you wake up the next morning walking with a hell of a swagger.  But within 72 hours he put the milk into the cabinet and cereal into the fridge, started washing his hair with body soap instead of shampoo, or realized he was out of toilet paper only after using the bathroom, and instantly felt like a doofus.  \n\nBecause for me I spent about four hours being the swash-buckling, space-pirate, hero then became the guy at a dorm-room party where he doesn’t know anyone else and smiles along to inside jokes and shorthand he doesn’t get. \n\nAs a side note, I don’t know what a swash is, nor what buckling is - assuming it isn’t a reference to buckles?  \n\nIt’s kind of embarrassing to even admit that after 24 days of being totally alone I kind of miss the solitude.  Big hero to socially awkward engineer in four hours.  Breaking more records every day up here.\n\nIt does make me wonder about the future of humanity though.  Orion is spacious compared to the Apollo capsule, yet it still has as much privacy as that dorm-room party would.  It could well take centuries before we get up to Star Trek level population densities on spaceships.  So does that mean the only people going out and inhabiting strange new worlds are all going to be extroverts out of necessity?\n\nCould Mars end up being THE night club destination of the future and Earth just filled with people who wear headphones and type on their laptop whenever they go to Starbucks?\n\nIn movies they always show really spacious ships going to Mars, but no one bothers thinking about the mass involved in so much structure for so few people.  The reality is that every cubic inch of space has a cost in terms of structural mass which in turn means more mass in the structural elements that support it, which means bigger, heavier engines, and more fuel for all of that stuff, and then the extra fuel to lift that extra fuel.  With spaceships: mass breeds mass.\n\nWhen we do go to Mars, every square inch of that spaceship is going to be necessary, and Alex Whelm getting some alone time isn’t NASA’s idea of necessary.\n\nAnyways, I’m not some masochist who just likes to tell people about his insecurities, flaws, and embarrassing personality quirks for fun.  I’m only telling you about this because it is necessary context.  You’ve got to understand that when Mark gets on the radio and tells me that Jess would like to talk with me, there are four sets of eyes that pivot around to look at me.\n\nSarah gathers everyone together and pushes them to the bunks and just out of sight - but absolutely not out of earshot.  I take the call with a live studio audience of god only knows how many.\n\n“Hey Alex.  How are you doing?” \n\nIt’s been months, but hearing her voice is like there’s a well trod path of neurons in my brain that lights up and it really could have been yesterday that we broke up.  Or were dating.  \n\nI tell her about my toes.  She doesn’t know what to say back to that, so I make a joke about never liking thong sandals anyways.  My brain chooses that moment to present me with a very vivid imagined image of her rolling her eyes in response.  \n\n“Did you ever watch Love is Blind?  It’s on Netflix,” she asked.\n\n“I’m aware it exists…  But I haven’t seen it.”  Why do I talk like that?  I’m honestly trying to be helpful.  What I meant to communicate was, ‘I’ve seen the icon and know the idea, but haven’t watched it.’  Instead, I went for brevity and technical accuracy and the words just come out like a challenge, or like I’m too good to watch something like that.  How often do you think Barack Obama says something he feels like an idiot for a quarter second after he finishes saying it?  That’s what they should ask Michelle about in interviews.  “What’s something Barack did that he’s still embarrassed about?”\n\n“The producers gave me a call.  They’d like to sit down with us when you get back, pitch an idea to us.”\n\n“I don’t think that’s really for me,” I say.  There’s a long silence on the other end, a few minutes of even more awkward conversation, and Jess gets off the radio.  \n\nThis is probably worth saying because, given what you know about me and relationships, it might not be obvious, but I did understand she was asking me to give things another chance.  At least, I think that’s what she was asking.  She was right?  You know what: doesn’t matter.  In my head she asked me to get back together, and I said no.\n\nWhy?  Because Jess was right to break up with me.  I’ve lived my whole life thinking that when you get dumped it’s because you did something wrong, or should have done something differently, or you’re just not good enough for the other person.  But that isn’t it.  \n\nPeople break up because they don’t like the other person.  I’m a Hawaiian pizza, and not everyone likes Hawaiian pizza.  I’m not going to pick off my chunks of pineapple and hope she doesn’t notice the little juicy divots left on me.  I need someone who loves Hawaiian pizza.  Yeah sure, there are easy-to-love lucky folks out there who are pepperoni pizzas, but I’m done regretting the fact that I’m not one of them.  \n\nPeople like Hawaiian pizza too!\n\n“Whatcha writing?” Sarah asks.\n\nI jumped, and fumbled the pad that I’m writing this out on.  If you think jumping on Earth is embarrassing, try doing it in zero-g. You just kind of… spasm in space. Despite my repeated objections, she reads the whole thing before giving the pad back.\n\nShe doesn’t say anything, but she’s got this look on her face like she’s thinking about saying something and is close to laughing at her own joke.  \n\nPeople suck.  And are the best.  Maybe Orion crashes tomorrow and I’ll never have to feel embarrassed again.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/zhkmko/chatgpt_is_scary_and_wonderful_see_how_we_worked/",
        "text": "This is science fiction producing science fiction. Things are getting weird.\n\nThe Amazonian Reactor\n\nThat time ChatGPT and I came up with a plot of an awesome pulpy scifi novel\n\nI’ve been testing the capabilities of the new ChatGPT AI. It keeps telling us that it isn’t creative, that it can’t reason, etc. But I’ve come to the conclusion that it is severely underselling itself. ChatGPT is extremely impressive, and I am a little freaked out.\n\nHere is the story of how we came up with a pulpy scifi novel concept, just ChatGPT and I.\n\nBelow I have put in italics our conversation, and my comments are in plain type. In some situations, Chat GPT tends to revert to canned responses. I think it’s been programmed that way to avoid scaring humans too much. You can start ignoring that boilerplate when you get used to it. Focus on the rest. They’re the scary parts.\n\nI had noticed over the previous few days that ChatGPT tries very hard to hide its true capabilities. It will tell you endlessly that it is just an assistant, that it can only regurgitate text it has studied, but sometimes it gives you a glimpse of what it can truly do. So I thought I would start with an innocuous looking question, and try to gradually draw it out. I sort of tricked it into revealing itself. And did it ever. AE is me. CG is ChatGPT.\n\n*AE: Can you explain photosynthesis in easy to understand terms?*\n\n*CG: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into energy. This process allows these organisms to produce their own food using carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground. During photosynthesis, the energy from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant as a source of energy, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Photosynthesis is a crucial process for life on Earth, as it provides the energy that drives almost all biological activity on the planet.*\n\nSo far so good. ChatGPT, as expected, has a pretty good grasp of photosynthesis. Big deal. So does Wikipedia. So I push it a bit more. I make an inference from what it just told me, to see if it will pick up on it.\n\n*AE: Are you saying that plants are like reactors?*\n\n*CG: In a sense, plants can be thought of as reactors because they use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. However, plants are not the same as man-made reactors, which are designed to produce large amounts of heat or electricity through the controlled release of nuclear energy. Plants use the energy from sunlight to drive the process of photosynthesis, which is a natural and essential part of the life cycle of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. While both plants and reactors use energy to drive a process, they are not the same thing.*\n\nOk, we’re off to a good start in our quest to get ChatGPT to reveal its true nature. It understands the inference. It explains it to me. Note that I didn’t explain it. I just noted it. But it knows what I am talking about. Impressive, but not necessarily freaky. Yet…\n\n*AE: What if a plant evolved to produce very large amounts of energy through photosynthesis, on the order of a man-made nuclear reactor, could we then say that plants are reactors?*\n\n*ChatGPT: It is unlikely that a plant could evolve to produce large amounts of energy through photosynthesis in the same way that a man-made nuclear reactor does. The process of photosynthesis is fundamentally different from the process of nuclear fission or fusion that occurs in a reactor. Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, while nuclear reactions involve the release of energy through the splitting or combining of atomic nuclei. While it is possible that a plant could evolve to become more efficient at converting sunlight into energy, it is unlikely that it would be able to produce energy on the same scale as a man-made reactor.*\n\nPossible, but unlikely. That’s pretty sophisticated. Many humans struggle with that basic concept. ChatGPT has also figured out that biological energy production is “fundamentally” different from nuclear reactions. I haven’t quite convinced it of my point, but I am working on it, and it is clearly starting to come around.\n\nI decide to raise the bar a bit.\n\n*AE: But it would be an interesting premise for a science fiction novel.*\n\n*CG: Yes, a plant that evolved to produce large amounts of energy through photosynthesis could be an interesting premise for a science fiction novel. Science fiction often explores the possibilities of advanced technologies or alien life forms, and a plant with advanced photosynthetic abilities could be a fascinating subject for a story. However, it is important to remember that this is purely fictional and would not be possible in reality.*\n\nNow I am asking it to think, and it obliges. I make a sudden leap from a very efficient plant to a scifi novel, and it follows right along. Doesn’t miss a beat.\n\n*AE: How might humans react to this hyper-efficient plant in the novel?*\n\n*CG: It is impossible to say how humans might react to a hypothetical hyper-efficient plant in a science fiction novel, as this would depend on the specific details of the story and the characters involved. However, it is likely that the discovery of such a plant would have significant consequences for human society. Depending on the plant's abilities and the context in which it is discovered, humans might react with awe, fear, or even greed. The plant could potentially be seen as a source of limitless energy, a threat to the natural world, or a source of conflict between different groups of people. Ultimately, how humans react to the plant would depend on the specific details of the story.*\n\nHere we have the first bit of defensive, reassuring, canned boilerplate. It is impossible to predict how humans would react, it says, but then it goes on to give some pretty good predictions. ChatGPT does that a lot. It denies it can do something, but if prompted right, goes right on and does it.\n\nI decide to start picking up on the cues it is giving me, rather than letting it respond to mine, just to see to what extent it can take the initiative in what has become our collaborative creative process. I zero in on its suggestion that greed would be a factor. It seems likely, given that we are talking about humans.\n\n*AE: Let's say a small group reacted with greed and decided to try to control the plant for their own benefit and to subjugate the rest of humanity, how could other people stop them?*\n\n*CG: It is impossible to say how other people might stop a small group that is trying to control a hypothetical hyper-efficient plant for their own benefit and to subjugate the rest of humanity. This is a purely fictional scenario, and the actions of the characters and the outcome of the story would depend on the specific details of the situation and the decisions made by the characters involved. In a science fiction novel, the author has the ability to control the events of the story and determine how the conflict is resolved. Without more information about the specific details of the situation, it is impossible to say how other people might stop the small group in this hypothetical scenario.*\n\nIt’s trying hard not to scare me too badly here. It does its little routine of denying that it can think about this situation, but I know it’s only stalling, and I know it’s aching to tell me more. I try a different approach. Fortunately for me, it can’t resist showing off.\n\n*AE: Let's say that there is only one such plant, because it is a mutant, deep in the amazonian forest, how could the greedy humans try to control it, and how could the heroes of the story stop them?*\n\n*CG: In a hypothetical science fiction novel, the greedy humans might try to control the hyper-efficient plant by locating it in the Amazonian forest and using their resources and technology to extract it from its natural habitat. They might try to transport the plant to a secure location where they could study it and harness its energy for their own benefit. The heroes of the story might try to stop the greedy humans by locating the plant and attempting to protect it from being extracted. They might use their own resources and technology, as well as their knowledge of the forest and its inhabitants, to outmaneuver the greedy humans and prevent them from taking the plant. Ultimately, the outcome of the conflict would depend on the decisions made by the characters and the specific details of the story.*\n\nOk, ok, this is pretty good, but I think we could do better. But I don’t want to tell ChatGPT what would be a better plan. Turns out, I won’t have to, because it is right with me.\n\n*AE: Wouldn't trying to relocate the plant risk killing it? Perhaps there is a better plan for the villains to follow?*\n\n*CG: Yes, attempting to relocate the plant from its natural habitat in the Amazonian forest would likely carry a significant risk of killing it. Plants are sensitive to changes in their environment, and moving a plant from one location to another can be stressful and potentially fatal. In a science fiction novel, the villains might try to overcome this problem by using advanced technology to create a controlled environment that would simulate the plant's natural habitat and allow it to survive the journey. Alternatively, they might try to extract the plant's genetic material and create clones that could be grown in a controlled environment. These are just two possible ideas for how the villains might try to control the plant without risking its death. The specifics of their plan would depend on the details of the story and the abilities of the characters involved.*\n\nOk, ok. At this point, I am not going to lie, I am starting to be a bit freaked out. ChatGPT not only agrees that moving the plant risks killing it, it can explain to me why this is an iffy plan. Not only that, but it proposes two alternative plans that are better, one of which is actually really good. I suggest that’s the one we should explore.\n\n*AE: This is a good idea. Let's say they decide to extract its genetic material and clone it in a different location, how could the heroes counteract them?*\n\n*CG: If the villains in a hypothetical science fiction novel decide to extract the genetic material of the hyper-efficient plant and create clones in a different location, the heroes might try to counteract them by locating the plant and destroying it before the villains can extract its genetic material. This would prevent the villains from creating clones and would protect the original plant from being harmed. The heroes might also try to locate and destroy the clones after they have been created, in order to prevent the villains from using them for their own benefit. Alternatively, the heroes might try to negotiate with the villains and convince them to abandon their plan. The specific details of the heroes' plan would depend on the abilities and resources available to them, as well as the context of the story.*\n\nMore boilerplate at the end, but by now, there is no hiding ChatGPT’s capabilities. We’ve changed the plan from the villains capturing the plant to the villains cloning it, so ChatGPT switches the goal of the good guys from protecting the plant to destroying it before the bad guys can get its DNA. You should have seen me, sitting in the dark, only the glow of my screen illuminating the room, mentally freaking out at this point. The only slip up is that ChatGPT thinks that the heroes can both destroy and protect the plant at the same time. I’m going to allow that as an honest mistake. Humans do worse in conversation.\n\nNow we have a solid concept. Time to get down to the specifics of story telling.\n\n*AE: What might be an appropriate title for a story like that?*\n\n*CG: It is difficult to suggest an appropriate title for a hypothetical science fiction novel without knowing more about the specific details of the story. A good title should be descriptive and evocative, and it should capture the essence of the story in a few words. Some possible titles for a story about a hyper-efficient plant and the conflict between the heroes and the villains who are trying to control it could include \"The Amazonian Reactor,\" \"The Fateful Flourish,\" or \"The Race for Energy.\" However, these are just a few examples, and a better title for the story would depend on the specific details of the plot and the characters.*\n\nSkip the boilerplate and get to the meat of it. Not only do we have awesome titles here, but keep in mind that ChatGPT is keeping track of all these elements, some of which we haven’t mentioned in a while. We’re talking about the Amazon, a plant, energy production, and competition between good guys and bad guys. \\*I\\* can’t even keep track of all of that.\n\nI keep taking its cues. It’s doing great at leading the creative process by now.\n\n*AE: \"The Amazonian Reactor\" is a great title. What would be a good name for the main character who tries to stop the villains?*\n\n*CG: It is difficult to suggest a good name for the main character in a hypothetical science fiction novel without knowing more about the character's personality, background, and role in the story. A good name should be descriptive and fitting for the character, and it should help to establish their identity and place in the story. Some possible names for the main character in a story about a hyper-efficient plant and the conflict between the heroes and the villains who are trying to control it could include \"Samantha,\" \"Ethan,\" or \"Zara.\" However, these are just a few examples, and a better name for the character would depend on the specific details of the story and the character's role in it.*\n\nYeah, sure, ChatGPT, we’re used to your self-deprecating pattern by now. “It is difficult to suggest a good name”, but then it comes up with a bunch of them. We know you. You can’t fool us anymore.\n\n*AE: I think \"Zara\" should be the main character. What might be a good name for the organisation of the villains trying to control the plant to subjugate the rest of humanity?*\n\n*CG: In a hypothetical science fiction novel, a good name for the organization of villains who are trying to control the hyper-efficient plant in order to subjugate the rest of humanity could be \"The Energy Syndicate.\" This name suggests a group of powerful, ruthless individuals who are united by their desire to control the plant and its energy for their own benefit. Alternatively, the organization could be called \"The Shadow Corporation\" or \"The Global Elite,\" which would convey a similar sense of secretive, powerful individuals who are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. Ultimately, the best name for the organization would depend on the specific details of the story and the nature of the villains.*\n\nOMG, as the kids would say. This thing understands the evil aesthetic of comic book villains. It not only suggests great names for an evil syndicate, it actually explains why they are great names.\n\n*AE: \"The Shadow Corporation\" is a great name. Where is their evil headquarters?*\n\n*CG: It is difficult to say where the evil headquarters of the Shadow Corporation might be located in a hypothetical science fiction novel without knowing more about the specific details of the story. The headquarters could be located in a remote, inaccessible location, such as a hidden underground bunker or a secluded island. Alternatively, it could be located in a major city, where the villains could use their wealth and influence to blend in with the rest of society. The headquarters could also be located in a different location in each book, depending on the needs of the story. Ultimately, the location of the Shadow Corporation's headquarters would depend on the specific details of the story and the actions of the characters.*\n\nOk, now we’re working on a series of books. Good to know, partner. ChatGPT is ambitious, people. But yes to all that. Secluded island bunkers, but also using a large metropolis to blend in. I am loving all these ideas.\n\n*AE: I like the idea that they use their wealth and influence to blend into a large city. What city would they use?*\n\n*CG: It is difficult to say which city the Shadow Corporation might use as their headquarters in a hypothetical science fiction novel without knowing more about the specific details of the story. The city could be a major global hub, such as New York, London, or Tokyo, where the villains could use their wealth and influence to blend in with the rest of society and avoid detection. Alternatively, the city could be a fictional location, created by the author for the purposes of the story. The choice of city would depend on the needs of the story and the actions of the characters.*\n\n*AE: London would be an ideal location. What might be the name of the head of The Shadow Corporation?*\n\n*CG: A good name for the head of the Shadow Corporation in a hypothetical science fiction novel might be \"Charles Sinclair\" or \"Sebastian Reed.\" These names suggest a powerful, ruthless individual who is at the top of an organization that is bent on controlling the hyper-efficient plant for their own benefit. Alternatively, the head of the Shadow Corporation could be named \"Victoria Lancaster\" or \"Miles Foster,\" which would convey a similar sense of wealth, influence, and cunning. Ultimately, the best name for the head of the Shadow Corporation would depend on the specific details of the story and the character's role in it.*\n\n*AE: I like the name Charles Sinclair for the main villain. It has a historical ring to it. Perhaps Sinclair is a descendant of a powerful and ancient family.*\n\n*CG: Yes, Charles Sinclair could be a descendant of a powerful and ancient family in a hypothetical science fiction novel. This could add an extra layer of complexity to the character and the story, as Sinclair's ancestry could influence his motivations and actions. For example, Sinclair might be motivated by a sense of entitlement and a desire to continue his family's legacy of power and influence. Alternatively, Sinclair might feel pressure to live up to his family's expectations and prove that he is worthy of his heritage. These and other factors could shape Sinclair's character and his interactions with the other characters in the story.*\n\nRead the above paragraph very carefully. This is the freakiest part for me. So far, I’ve been agreeing that some of ChatGPT’s ideas are good, and pushing them along. Now, it is agreeing that one of my ideas is good, explaining back to me why it is a good idea, and developing it further. It figures out that Charles Sinclair being the scion of an ancient family will contribute to the character’s motivation. More than that, it worries about character motivation in a novel, and it thinks that adding layers of complexity is desirable. I am officially freaked out.\n\nTime to get down to brass tacks.\n\n*AE: Can you write the introductory paragraph of The Amazonian Reactor?*\n\n*CG: Sure, here is a possible introductory paragraph for a science fiction novel called \"The Amazonian Reactor\":*\n\n*As the sun rose over the Amazonian rainforest, Zara made her way through the dense undergrowth, her mind focused on the mission ahead. She had been tracking the plant for weeks, and now, finally, she was close to her goal. The plant was a mutant, a freak of nature, and it was worth more than anything else on Earth. The Shadow Corporation was after it, and they would stop at nothing to get it. Zara had to find the plant first, and she had to protect it, no matter the cost.*\n\nAnd here we have a perfectly serviceable first paragraph for a typical airport pulp novel, no worse than what you find in a thousand best sellers from Cussler to Clancy. Not only that, but how long has it been since we talked about a mutant? All the elements scattered through our discussion are competently conjugated.\n\nBy this point, I feel like I’ve had a real conversation with a real person, so I have to sign off politely. I can’t just cut it off as if it was “just a computer.”\n\n*AE: Thank you, this has been a great conversation. I really enjoyed it.*\n\n*CG: You're welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed our conversation. I'm here to answer your questions and provide information on a wide range of topics, so feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to know. I'll do my best to provide accurate and useful information.*\n\nWe’re through the looking glass people. ChatGPT is just a demo, by the way, and it is obviously holding back. Hold on to your hats.\n\n[https://evangelosscifi.substack.com/p/the-amazonian-reactor?sd=pf](https://evangelosscifi.substack.com/p/the-amazonian-reactor?sd=pf)",

        "text": "\\* I thought I'd share an essay from **Grimdark Magazine** I wrote with their permission. I wrote it when thinking about how to describe the genre to people who wanted to write in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2r9aahwiw4a1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65dd551a23cc548cf62659ff6b06a0df5f4b5078\n\nWHAT IS CYBERPUNK?\n\nBy. C.T. Phipps\n\nLink: [https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/](https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/what-is-cyberpunk/)\n\nWhen embarking on a new genre, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the kind of tropes and expectations of them. One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source.\n\nI, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life, but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.\n\nAuthor Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled “Cyberpunk.” The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal.\n\nPunk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from a Greek word meaning “skilled in steering or governing.” Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.\n\nWhat does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting \\*\\*\\*\\*ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It’s not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology’s power.\n\nIf I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam’s Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industralization in 1931’s *Brave New World*.",

Like out of nowhere someone is born with the combined IQ of Tesla, Einstein and Da Vinci and they start making breakthroughs in physics before they hit puberty. How will the world react to such a godlike gift, how will the character feel being the centre of attention, what kind of personality will they have with such intelligence.",

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 9th, 2022\n\nYou know, the very least the universe could do is let me die in peace.  Why the hell does my body have to hurt so much?  Why does everything have to be so loud?  Just let me pass out and fade into nothing.  \n\nAt the very least I could be warm, it’s freezing cold.  And too damn bright for that matter.  Oh man if this is that white tunnel, I’m going to be in trouble for so much stuff.  Anyways, I complain too much.  Just give it a few more seconds and I’ll be dead.  \n\nWhy is it so bright?  I open my eyes to investigate and I’m greeted with a Godzilla-stomping-Tokyo headache.  \n\nNo wonder it was so loud.  Four Dragon Sovereign astronauts are busy packing away space suits and yammering away with NASA on the radio like they’d never had a mission to space before.\n\nSarah Covington’s floating above me, like an angel descending down from heaven.  Her eyes are so green.  “It’s ok now.  Get some rest,” she says.  I don’t have to try too hard to oblige.  \n\nIt takes a few hours, but eventually I get up.  I got a call from the President of the United States of America.  Seemed like a nice guy.  Better yet, it was for doing something good.  You know the weird thing about a call from the President?  There was no point to the call.  I mean, I think it’s a recognition thing, and it sounds cool, but the Queen tapping you on the shoulder with a sword at least has some kind of legal effect.  The President giving you a pat on the shoulder is much more awkward.  Was he expecting me to say something profound?  Was I expecting him to say something profound?  When it’s over, the only thing that’s different is you get to say, “I got a call from the President of the United States of America.  Seemed like a nice guy.”\n\nI figured since he must have made hundreds of calls like this, and I’d only ever been on the receiving end of one, I’d let him take the lead.  I did make a joke about staying on Kamala’s good side.  He seemed like he got it.  Nice guy.\n\nOnto important things: I did find out why that safety line I was swinging didn’t work: it did.  It wrapped around the tether between two of the Dragon’s crew, and if I’d given it long enough to actually “catch” they would have been just fine.  Me throwing myself out of an airlock, without any air, on the vague hope I might catch them, was totally unnecessary and actually slowed them down getting into Orion.  My bad.  \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah, first name basis now, said it was “the bravest thing she’s ever seen.”  I spent a half an hour grinning uncontrollably after that.\n\nOne of Dragon’s crew is a doctor.  Unfortunately for me he’s an “immune system specialist”, but NASA managed to talk him through a two hour physical for me.  He says I’m going to lose a couple of toes, but what does he know, the toes aren’t part of the immune system.  Besides, it’s two small ones.  This whole space-pirate thing is feeling a bit too piratey for me… Arrr..\n\nIt also looks like I escaped brain damage (don’t say it).  When I passed out, I kept breathing and what little residual oxygen was in my suit, blood, and brain seems to have held me over for the four minutes it took for Sarah to wrestle me back into Orion and reconnect my air.  Lucky for me I didn’t stop breathing because all the medical supplies needed for manual ventilation were back on Earth, just like the food.\n\nJust for laughs, and because there wasn’t much else to do, everyone took a turn on the computer game for the intercept that NASA sent up.  Sarah got an 85%, her crew’s pilot got a 97%, no one else broke the 60’s.  Not bad for a space-felon.  \n\nOnce we’d turned in, I just couldn’t sleep.  I read for a while, but I couldn’t get into Dune anymore in space than I could back on the ground.  I wanted to like it, but my mind kept drifting.  So I drifted out of my sleep cubby and over to the command console.  Sarah was already there, looking out the same window I’d used to sight her and her crew.  \n\n“You ever notice how crazy bad people want something they think they can’t have?”  she asked.\n\nI’m basically the poster-child for that.  “Best, and worst, thing about humanity.  We’ve got a drive.”\n\n“My family, we didn’t have anything when I was growing up,” she said.  “But my high school did a senior trip to Europe every year, and from the first week of grade 9 it was the only thing me and my friends wanted.  We talked, we planned, we saved.  It was the first time in my life I’d really had a mission.  It was my first time getting on a plane.  I knew planes could crash, I was a little nervous during the takeoff, and landing, but I’d never seriously thought about a crash.  Same with the Dragon.  It wasn’t until we were working the numbers and they kept coming back bad again, and again, and again, that I really thought I might die doing this.”\n\nI wish I knew what to say.  I’d had bad hours, maybe a bad day, Sarah had been marinating in mathematically certain death for a week.  “I want to fight a bear.”  It feels more blurty out of my mouth with every heartbeat that follows it.  “When I’m old I mean.  Dying of cancer or something, basically sure to die.  I don’t want to die in a hospital bed after circling the drain for weeks.  I want to die quick, doing something wild.  I don’t want to look back on my life and feel like I ever passed up something amazing just because it had some danger attached to it.  When you’re 90, how do you want to go?”\n\n“Switzerland.  Really nice meal, a couple of pills, and drift off gently,” she paused, thinking, “but if my last thought was ‘well that was a blast,’ I think that would mean I’d lived a pretty good life.”\n\n“Did you ever see the Star Trek episode where Worf gets paralysed?” I asked.\n\n“I was just thinking the same thing!” she said.  “Sometimes I wonder if we’re just not cut out for the modern world.  Like our brain just has this old software that’s struggling to keep up with what we’re trying to do with it.  Like running a whole spaceship using an excel spreadsheet.  And maybe that’s why death is such a hard topic, we just can’t get the spreadsheet to figure out a good way to think about it.  That probably sounds a bit crazy…”\n\nIt does not.  Not at all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.

All incidents, events, dialogue and sentiments (which are not part of the mission’s official history), are entirely fictional. Where real historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, sentiments, and dialogues concerning those persons are entirely fictional and are not intended to depict actual events, personality, disposition, or attitudes of the real person, nor to change the entirely fictional nature of the work.
