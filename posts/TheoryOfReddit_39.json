I've always wanted to quantify this, and also see how it varies across subreddits.\n\nSo, using all the reddit comments from January 2015 ([collected by /u/Stuck_In_The_Matrix](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) ) I calculated the number of comments per user of each subreddit, and used that to calculate the Gini Coefficient. The results weren't incredibly shocking, but nevertheless I thought it was interesting.

Some books like 'angels and demons' have 1 million of ratings on goodreads (whatever is the rating, at least one can assume one million of readers) and others like 'the swann's way' have barely 20 thousands of ratings.

        "text": "/u/spez has said it a few times, that he wants celebs to stop by /r/IAMA but he wants them to stick around and engage with the community (not just use it as another stopping point on the press circuit). \n\nToday's AMA with Natalie Imbruglia is probably the clearest example of a concerted effort by PR-types to mask what was nothing more than an orchestrated publicity stunt for her new album. \n\nDuring the AMA she answered about 20 or so questions, which is respectable given how some AMAs only answer half that many in the same time. However, as /u/digital_end points out, there appears to be at least 9 accounts that were created for the sole purpose of lobbing questions at her about her new album.\n\nHere's his breakdown: https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3fdqga/looks_like_natalie_imbruglias_ama_was_a_publicity/ctnpj82\n\nThe theme is surprisingly common:\n\n1. New user, no previous comment history\n2. Asks a positive/softball question, or one about her new album\n3. It gets very few upvotes yet gets an answer from the OP\n\nNow, I am not against celeb-types promoting their newest whatever while chatting with the community; in fact I like Natalie Imbruglia's music. However, I wonder if it'll ever be possible to curtail this kind of coordinated PR campaign. /r/IAMA is supposed to be egalitarian, where celebs can chat about all sorts of different things. Joss Whedon spent a ton of time talking about firefly, Al Gore responded to an obscure anecdote from a user who met him years earlier, Chris Pratt confirmed he was a former tenant at a users townhouse, and Neil Degrasse Tyson once answered which Street Shark was his favorite (Ripster, naturally). My point is that Reddit is the place for celebs to connect with people in a way that rarely happens in the heavily sanitized/scripted world of media/PR. I worry that Natalie's AMA further erodes AMAs being the platform it once was.\n\nMy thoughts for how to mitigate this are pretty straight forward: We should prohibit new accounts from posting questions, and perhaps update some of the AMA guidelines so that celebs are encouraged to answer real questions. Or maybe it's time to spinoff /r/IAMA into a celeb and a non-celeb subreddit, so that people can judge for themselves what is real and what is just a commercial that has been repackaged.",

        "text": "I think a case can be made for moderation.  This isn't about the merits of needing to moderate.\n\nThere is a need for protection of innocents and to weed out junk, particularly because people don't bury the junk on their own in most cases and it is a subjective job.\n\nIf the hive mind was useful in shaping content then moderators would have less workload in determining good content from bad per the rules of their respective subreddits.\n\nHowever there is another case for this that I want to discuss that I struggle with.  In a disturbing number of cases I ask \"good\" questions that won't be answered.\n\nMy definition of good is subjective, but what I mean is they are earnest, not meant to be spam, etc.  In short I assume that they are good enough if they are subject to the will or whims of the people.\n\nNow I have come across two major a separate problems that I think may be inflicting more folks than just me, and I'd be curious what there is that could be done about it.\n\n**1) Exhaustion** \nIn some subs, the moderation tools are lacking and it appears that given the load of the moderators to review and approve posts they can't keep up.  They only review a kind of quota and then move on, only making a dent in the content that they could consume.\n\nThis is clearly not their fault, but is victim to their own rules.  A combination of changes to their methods and better mod tools would eliminate this concern perhaps.  \n\nTo draw some context for this consider askscience (~6M subscribers, 1,000 concurrent, 400 moderators) and askreddit (~9M subscribers, 40,000 concurrent, less than 40 moderators).\n\nClearly the rules that askscience adopts requires a much higher manpower.  They cannot keep up and may choose to adapt. But let's continue.\n\n**2) Reach**\n\nIn my experience there are some very strict subs in terms of moderation.  This is the prerogative of the moderators, I respect that.  Although I have a lot of negative feeling about seeing [deleted] throughout threads in askhistory, I acknowledge that they run a quality discussion group.\n\nOne example of this though that I find disconcerting is ELI5.  I have asked questions where the implied quality is much better than other questions that have blown up but have been moderated out of the discussion entirely by moderation.  I accept their ruling and don't specifically challenge it.  I would definitely argue for better standards in some subs, but the problem that I want to talk about is reach.\n\nWhen you have a good question that you don't really need a specialist for, or you simply want a discussion to sort out your position you have few tenable options.\n\nAskReddit is a great sub, but the flow of messages is so high that even a good post doesn't grab attention long.\n\nI wrote possibly my best askreddit yesterday and monitored it's rise and fall through the new and hot tabs.  It got 8 upvotes, but the top rank it received in *hot* was 13, and in *new* I never saw it in the top 100.\n\nA similar incident related to ELI5's policies involved just removing the item when I was receives comments, which halted any further discussion on the topic.  It was originally removed via a trap in the autobots, but even after appeal the moderator wouldn't budge.  The moderator's opinion was that the post did not seek an explanation and that ELI5 was not for discussing topics.  I believe I was cordial, I wasn't a problem person and I think we would both agree that he was simply standing up to his principles.\n\nThe problem that I can see with this type of active moderation is it seems so random. It arguable doesn't do much to shape the overall content of the sub, there are ~5000 redditors online for ELI5 now and less than a dozen moderators.  They seem to cherry pick my posts :)\n\nIf I seem bitter it is not really fueled in my mind that way.  This is the big conundrum for me.  There are 5000 people that I could have reached in that sub, the alternatives they cited askreddit (40,000 concurrent) and answers (68 concurrent) means that there really is no good place that I can see to ask *dumb questions to the public at large* (my phrasing).\n\nOn the one hand no one will really see it, and the other the activity is so great that the post is rinsed from view prior to being able to get any reasonable attention.\n\nIs there a discussion to this essay I just wrote?\nLet's get into it...\n\nTLDR: I'm a geek and a fan of reddit, I love to analyze things way too much and I think there are structural problems with moderation or choice of the default subs.",

Reddit considers the idea to be so true or unarguable that it stifles other opinions on the subject\n\n4. Lack of contest to the tenets of this ideal makes it become oversimplified and it loses its luster\n\n5. This goes on to a ridiculous extent until the community looks foolish\n\n7. The idea loses popularity with mainstream Redditors\n\n8. The foolishness of the community becomes apparent, and it's now funny to mock the overzealous Redditors who made it popular\n\n9. The anti-circlejerk forms, where the idea has become so laughable that it's now taboo to speak of its positive attributes\n\n9. The anti-anti-circlejerk forms, where it is still cringe-worthy to act as in steps 2-5, it's not as funny to behave in the manner of steps 7-9. A sort of equilibrium has been reached. \n\nI'll give you an example: Reddit used to be really, in-your-face libertarian. It got to the point where the \"edgy teenage libertarian\" stereotype formed after this went on for too long. Then it became better to mock the libertarians who treated their idea like a religion than it was to defend and look foolish alongside them.\n\nNow many people on Reddit are still libertarians, it's just that they're a little quieter outside of specific subreddits. I think it's because they had to re-evaluate some of their more fanatical ideals to avoid mocking by the larger community. In this way, the circle of Reddit life is complete.\n\n\n(I think that another, possibly better example is what happened with atheism on Reddit)\n",

        "text": "I'll prefix this by saying that I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, and I have been an active participant in the subreddit /r/SandersForPresident. That said, I have been noticing that the subreddit is quite a unique type of subreddit. Its main goal is really just to discuss about Bernie Sanders in any ways possible. The subreddit is unique in that it's so autonomous from the other subreddit that it didn't even realize about the blackout while it was happening. \n\nThe community is tight-knit that it has created their own mythologies and it's the center in the web of other spin-off, which are in its own autonomous subreddit.\n\nSo needless to say, SandersForPresident is in itself, a circlejerk. The word circlejerk itself is an injustice, because I feel that the kind of reinforcement of the community's common admiration for Bernie has been very productive by means of help spreading the [100,000 RSVPd in 3500 events around the US](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-live-streams-to-thousands-house-parties/), a lot of really cool [web/mobile applications](http://map.berniesanders.com) to help the grassroots movements, and improve the name ID of Bernie in different states he has no teams over ([in florida, the latest poll has Sanders at 29% against Clinton](http://www.saintpetersblog.com/archives/236563). So much so that CNN has labeled the subreddit as Bernie's secret weapon. Essentially, the campaign and grassroots reddit movement feed off of each other.\n\nHowever, given that the userbase of the subreddit is around 70000 and we are all of common admiration towards Bernie, it is easy to have a post that is heavily upvoted - perhaps a classic case of a circlejerk if viewed outside of the community.  And when that happens, a post can easily fly up to 5000 upvotes, which will inevitably push it towards the front page.\n\nThat's when the ugliness starts.\n\nFor example, this photo was posted by one of the members of the community while he was in the house party Bernie Sanders was, and /u/rcas was posting photos from the event. However, the title was worded like a mundane dialogue between Bernie and the host of the house party.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3f3zaa/the_host_made_cake_for_bernie_bernie_asked_who/\n\nFor the members of the autonomous subreddit, this is a nice photo showing what are actually happening in the source of all the broadcasts, it was a sincere moment, and everyone liked it. When it still wasn't at the front page, the members were asking questions where it was, how jealous they were, asking for stories, etc. It was building up the excitement of the users, and essentially it's just a \"Hey look who I met\" sort of post.\n\nWhen it reached the front page, the flood gates have opened. People from outside the community started posting sarcastic/negative comments, declaring it is for circlejerk, etc, etc. It's like a gang raiding a peaceful village. The OP and some other members worked extra to provide context to the photo, a context that was not needed to people who know about the huge July 29 event. Things got sour and essentially did not look good.\n\nIs there a way to prevent this? Is the /r/all mechanism flawed in this regard, and is there a possibility for mods to turn the /r/all off for their posts? What would be the pros / cons?  OR another possibility is to put only Not Participation links in r/all.\n\nI guess being in /r/all widens the reach of the community without doing outreach, but also welcomes the bad side of reddit.",

My counter point to this is that isolated communities like those are insulated. They're echo chambers that get louder and louder until some fuck loses the context of internet trolling &amp; free speech and then goes on a killing spree, or at least he loses the filter that keeps him from acting on these beliefs in some other less-harmless way.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; It's a fallacy that anger dissipates as it's used. It's more like an addiction where your tolerance builds up and simply trolling doesn't satisfy it anymore and you end up going to extremes to get your \"fix.\" You get entire communities like this and you have a tinder box next to a bonfire.\n\nWhat are /u/iamyo and /u/CultureVulture629 talking about? Both posts criticize a particular view of Reddit, the \"mirror\",\n\n&gt; We go on Reddit and we reflect in words the way we are in life.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; Reddit tells us who we truly are, and of course we are largely powerless to change who we are.\n\nOf the two comments critical of the \"mirror\", the first uses the \"spider web\" and the second uses the \"echo chamber\".\n\nIn order to give this discussion a little more weight, I'll presume that these are more than metaphors, they are models or paradigms, they may be powerful ways of thinking about Reddit, and describing the behavior of Redditors. If you think it is too early to be talking this way, I say better to have a flawed or even wrong model than no model at all.\n\nOf these three models for the sociology of Reddit, the echo chamber is by far the most developed. It even has a Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media). It has been discussed on Reddit at least twice in depth:\n\nPrior discussion of the echo chamber in CMV: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2c1wge/cmv_all_of_reddit_is_an_echochamber/\n\nPrior discussion of the echo chamber in ToR: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3dpm0d/echo_chambers_are_the_downfall_of_reddit/\n\nThe ToR post comes about a year after the CMV post and does not *question* the echo chamber effect but rather *presumes* that the echo chamber model describes the way some subs work.\n\nSo how does hate work? We have three examples: /r/rapingwomen, /r/coontown, and /r/gasthekikes. No doubt there are many more lurking in the shadows. Are these subs places for people to...\n\n&gt; reflect in words the way we are in life?\n\n&gt; get together to spin little webs of hate?\n\n&gt; get louder and louder until some fuck loses the context?\n\nHaving put the nail in place, let me now hammer it in: I contend that Reddit denies a scientific, evidence-based inquiry into these issues when it \"destroys the evidence\" through banning harm-inciting subs. I claim that banning harm-inciting subs is a step toward alarmism, superstition, and speculation and a step away from rationality, level-headedness, and hypothesis-testing.\n\nThis is the difference between, \"I'm an expert, I understand how this works and I'm here to save you! Now do what I say, or *terrible things* are bound to happen!\" vs. \"I don't understand the principles involved. I would like to learn more and gain insight into how it works.\"\n\nYou listen to the so-called \"experts\" at your peril because they are pushing a political agenda, the agenda of censorship and suppression. They refuse to allow the experiment to continue. They refuse to allow the collection of data that could prove them wrong.\n\nAny \"expert\" who says, \"Put that thing down. You shouldn't play with it or you will hurt yourself. Rather, you should listen to me, and I will tell you how it works\" is making an argument that *all further* lines of inquiry into its operation should be closed off. It is a self-verifying position: you're never going to be able to prove this \"expert\" wrong because the \"expert\" says that even *gathering information* that could prove the \"expert\" wrong is *dangerous*.\n\nYou will never understand how something works if you are afraid to look at it. Are you going to listen to those who preach fear, uncertainty, and doubt, or are you going to listen to the guy who is asking you to open your eyes?",

        "text": "The question I want to present is: did the presence of the harm-inciting subreddits /r/rapingwomen and /r/gasthekikes make for an overall wiser, stronger, more robust internet society? [1]\n\nA while ago I said /r/rapingwomen was a breath of fresh air, and if I had known /r/gasthekikes was going to be banned as well, I would have protested the plans of /u/spez to ban the evil masterminds planning genocide there.\n\n&gt; b-b-but they're inciting harm! We must stamp out evil!\n\nWhat do you think is better: people doing evil in secret or people doing evil in public?\n\nPeople here seem to think that if speech is suppressed, then things won't go horribly wrong in society. It's completely mixed up. It's deluded. What you want in a civil society is people who understand all sides of history from different angles. People who have the capacity to step outside their native world-view for a moment. People who understand the language of evil.\n\nOne of those angles is seeing history through the eyes of evil people. How are you going to do that? By interacting with and having conversations with evil people.\n\nYou want to understand what it is about people that makes them hate each other. And you want to let the scientists of hatred ask questions. You want to give them access to data, the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of those who hate.\n\nThis idea of the ideal society as a perfectly regulated democratic system (there are many examples, but Zardoz comes to mind) of well-behaved individuals is just plain nuts. People aren't well-behaved, and trying to fit them into a rigid system that fails if it can't control the behavior of individuals is doomed.\n\nThe Reddit admins in general and /u/spez in particular should be *delighted* that people use the platform to express racial hatred and advocate sexual violence. The fact that people seem to think this will lead to negative IRL outcomes speaks to the complete unwillingness of the society we live in to take the inner lives of individuals seriously and take action accordingly. People are crazy, they're deranged, they're dangerous. This is naturally how they are, and they resist external control. This incuriosity can lead to disastrous consequences.\n\n&gt; Maybe if we don't know how people think, and don't ask questions, then we can pretend our world is neat and clean and well-ordered and everything will be fine.\n\nThis is skating on thin ice. The impulse to ban harm-inciting subreddits reflects incuriosity, the fear that life might entail things we don't like, things we don't want. It reflects the desire that Reddit should be a lovely thing, something beautiful that reflects only the good, positive qualities of being human. We want Reddit to tell us that we are the best of all. We want the fact that we are Redditors to be something we are proud of. What pride is there in being a Redditor? What pride is there in being alive? We go on Reddit and we reflect in words the way we are in life. Taking pride means we get caught up in ego games of our own devising, which will lead to grief when the truth finally comes out. [These are not my ideas](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.057.than.html).\n\n[Reddit Reddit on the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_-pDpLVVNc)\n\nReddit tells us who we truly are, and of course we are largely powerless to change who we are. We cling to this idea that we are powerful, but clearly the queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is powerless to change her own physical appearance.\n\nUrsula K Le Guin said it much better than I could ever hope to, but she had an entire book: [A Wizard of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard_of_Earthsea).\n\nPart of maturity is accepting your dark side. By rejecting its own dark side, Reddit persists in immaturity. And the society we live in is weaker and more vulnerable as a result.\n\n[1] By \"internet society\" I mean: the English-speaking, internet-connected, Reddit-browsing world and those who interact with this world, which is a large chunk of modern civilization.",

        "text": "I recently came across [this](http://redd.it/3e5w5h) post on /r/childfree, where the OP expressed surprise at not encountering many of the obstacles that other users regularly post about (specifically *bingo's*: a supposedly foolproof argument in favor of having children). This sparked a theory that isn't necessarily new, but is appearing in a context that I've never really seen before. I'd just like to flesh it out a bit.\n\n\nIn [*This Video Will Make You Angry*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc), CGPgrey does a great job explaining why online communities that are at odds with each other perpetuate each other's existence. But I'd like to go a step further and say that communities like /r/childfree, by the nature of their existence, can sometimes blow up a problem like being *bingo'd* to create an analogue for the opposing side, which may not exist in every case. I'll explain:\n\n\nWe know off the bat that /r/childfree is not an unbiased source of information. We also know that more dramatic and intriguing stories are likely to be upvoted. So I think it's safe to assume that all *bingo* related posts on the front page of /r/childfree reflect the most negative experiences people have had. I would like to reiterate here that *there is nothing wrong with this, it's the nature of the subreddit and reddit's voting algorithm*. But what this does is create a more dramatized narrative for your average subscriber of what it means to decide to not have children.\n\n\nNow on to the ramifications of this, which is what my theory is about. I have a disclaimer at the end, because this theory is only true in a specific context. For someone who has *not* faced the obstacles that are so often talked about in /r/childfree, or any subreddit for that matter, there can be a sense of what is almost disappointment. Obviously, there are feelings of relief, but when someone gets worked up over these alleged obstacles and they fail to materialize, that person can feel unfulfilled. Often times people use opposing views to justify their own. So when the opposition isn't what they expected, that person might feel embarrassed over getting so worked up.\n\n\n/r/childfree celebrates users who refute *bingo's*, and who take a stand against opponents to defend their position - and why shouldn't they? This is typical fare as far as subreddits go. My concern - my theory, is that subreddits who are for or against certain concepts can easily exaggerate issues, which is detrimental to their own subscribers if their personal experience falls short of the typical narrative. \n\n\nJust look at the title of the original post: It has a tone of disappointment. The OP was expecting to overcome significant hurtles, which in the end would in the end further justify their position.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't want anyone to think I'm saying these people enjoy being harassed about their life decisions. What I'm trying to make is a larger comment about how we can be disappointed when a situation does not meet our expectations, *even if those expectations are negative*\n\n\nThank you for reading \\^.^",

This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.\"\n\nSome have referred to this as locking these subs in the basement.\n\n\n1)  Subs in the basement do not generate revenue for reddit.  This means that reddit is subsidizing these subs and they will be ad free.  In so far as ads are a cost or drawback to using reddit, this makes the experience in these subs superior to the vanilla reddit experience.  [Relevant post from /r/4chan](https://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3doy5v/as_many_of_you_have_heard_reddit_admins_are_now/)  \n\n\n2) Implicit in the distinction of this new type of sub is that subs outside of the basement would not \"violate a common sense of decency\".  Presumably the moderators would be enforcing this expectation.  For the vast majority of subs, this is probably no change, /r/science or /r/Terreria etc. already enforce these sorts of rules.  For a handful of subs that are borderline, this is an additional burden.  It strikes me that some subs may prefer the basement for this reason - it would ease the burden on the moderation team.  \n\n\n3) By requiring a username/password for these basement subs their stats will likely increase, at least in the short-term.  [redditlist](http://redditlist.com/all)  Now you would need to login and subscribe to view the content in these subs, so greater subscriber numbers.  And as long as you've gone to the effort to create an account, may as well do some voting or commenting, resulting in greater activity numbers.\n\nEdit: commas and whatnot",

Your obligation is to *allow* them to speak words you disagree with, not to actively *help* them spread their message. And if reddit were to decide it no longer wishes to give free hosting services to hate speech forums, it would not deny anyone the legal right to speak their mind.

They could go to Voat, or they could download a copy of reddit's code (it's open source) and host it themselves. From a software engineering perspective, it would be an intern-level task.\n\nNobody involved in the reddit hate speech debate is calling for it to be prohibited by law or for reddit to interfere with anyone's right to express themselves off-site; they're merely calling for reddit to stop being the one to provide the free microphone.\n",

        "text": "A few key changes over the past few years have, in my view, led us to where we are now on reddit. I'd like to break them down and offer possible solutions. \n\n* It starts with a sharp rise in popularity. New users flock to the site because of its emerging cultural relevance. But this wave is less concerned than many existing users about the concept of creating and enriching an online community. Reddit becomes less like an online club and more like normal Western society.\n\n* The increase in cultural relevance (ubiquitous celebs, regular mentions in mainstream media) creates an environment where more is at stake on the site. From commenters knowing that their thoughts will be read by thousands of people, to PR people getting an article about their client on the front page, \"what people see on reddit\" is perceived as more important.\n\n\n* American culture wars revived. In contrast to the political debates that dominated the earlier part of this century, the recent issues of race, immigration, gay marriage, and \"over-sensitivity\" represent a shift in the conversation towards much deeper-seated, emotional issues for many Americans, who comprise a large portion of the site. I can't speak for those outside the U.S. \n\n* The constant news media cycle, which creates hysterical echo chambers and sustains itself by building problems up to be much bigger than they are. Many users of FPH fell victim to this, justifying their actions by claiming they were combating the specter of the fat acceptance movement, even though most people have never even heard of it. \n\n* An example in the Ellen Pao debacle. Spurred by culture wars, and amplified by the change in reddit's demographics, the whole \"Ellen Pao thing\" spiraled out of control because it gave combative redditors the battle they've been dying to fight, in an arena they perceived as important. It took all of about 2 seconds for redditors to ready their pitchforks, suggesting they took them out of the shed a while ago. \n\nRevved up on emotion and soundbites, reddit has become a place for many users to simply do battle with words, mirroring cable news talk shows and comment sections in political news articles. Gone from mainstream reddit is the user who cared at all about building community, replaced by those who want to loudly make their point or vent viciously.  \n\n\n\nHere's what I'd like to see, and I believe the administration has the power to help greatly:\n\n* Make a clear content policy, then leave that discussion to dry. Instead, make a strong, positive stance on another issue that is both begging to be addressed and essential to a healthy public forum: civil discourse. Prioritize it, and make it a central element of the site. If people think that approach is lame or soft, they should leave and the site will be better for it. \n\n* Encourage civil discourse by empowering moderators. Now, I have no idea how moderating works nor do I have the slightest sense of the technology behind reddit. But it seems logical that a) the mods are the lynchpin of the whole site and b) they have the power to encourage a more civil discourse throughout the site. Do what needs to be done, either by reward or empowerment, to help them do this.\n\n \n\n",

Giving users the power to see what they are interested in gives them that power to confide themselves into an echo chamber. Subreddits make for easy to form, easy to manage echo chambers.\n\nThe unfortunate problem with these echo chambers is that people who seclude themselves will become more and more hateful, and more likely to actually harass or harm others. A form of tribalism occurs where the user slowly acclimates to the doctrine of the respective echo chamber, which may have less a less than decent morality. When secluded in an echo chamber, the user will not directly interact with the ideas they disagree with, but with an extreme version of those ideas. They will accentuate what in their eyes are negative things.\n\nTaking a look at /r/fatpeoplehate, it had the hallmarks of a typical echo chamber: Banning dissent, having a specific set doctrine, and a tribalistic user base. The same holds true for /r/shitredditsays, /r/coontown, and others. It happens on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and other sites. Barring these subreddits off only makes it worse.\n\nTL;DR: Extreme ideas and ideologies breed from echo chambers, and subreddits are an easy way to set one up.",

        "text": "The recent going ons at Reddit got me to thinking.\n\nBack before we had smart phones and IPads, when you went to take a poop in a public restroom, all you had were the walls to read.\n\nI had just started college and was doing my business and there on the door, scratched into the paint, were the big block letters spelling “Fuck You.”\n\nI remember this because it started me on kind of a journey of sorts.  I am one of those guys that questions why things are the way they are.  I have always been like this.\n\nI remember wondering what would compel a guy to take out his keys and etch “Fuck You” onto the door?  Who was that directed towards?  What need did this serve? If you think about it, unless they were waiting outside they would never see my reaction.  Oh, but they would know someone saw it.  Well they showed them!\n\nThis, as I said, got me to thinking about who writes what on bathroom walls.  That research happened a long time ago, and I fancied myself writing a paper on it.  Really, that’s how my brain occupies itself.\n\nSo fast forward to Reddit 2015. \n\nThis statement by Former CEO Yishan made me think about those bathroom wall writers when he said this:\n\n&gt;Human minds love originalism, e.g. \"we're in trouble, so surely if we go back to the original intentions, we can make things good again.\" Sorry to tell you guys but NO, that wasn't their intention at all ever. Sucks to be you, /r/coontown - I hope you enjoy voat!\n\nAnd then today, Ellen Pao is [quoted](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-cannot-let-the-internet-trolls-win/2015/07/16/91b1a2d2-2b17-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html) as saying:\n\n&gt;The foundations of the Internet were laid on free expression, but the founders just did not understand how effective their creation would be for the coordination and amplification of harassing behavior.\n\nBoth of these statements assume that this behavior is new.  Well I am here to tell you, it is not.\n\nLet’s look at what was being done 40 years ago to bathroom stalls.  Most of us were lurkers.  We read but we never commented.  We relied on others to give us the content to occupy the time.\n\nNow, excluding the boring taggers who just want to see their name or affiliation on every surface, you ended up with these basic submissions:\n\n* Porn aficionado:  These guys like to draw anatomically incorrect sized penises and boobs as well as spread eagle women.\n\n* Revenge porn: “For a good time call Nancy at…”\n\n* Humorist: Original stuff, not seen before, funny enough to make you quietly laugh.  My favorite was “Reagan Party Hats” written on the toilet seat cover dispenser.\n\n* Reposters: Zero effort.  “Here I sit brokenhearted...” “Flush twice it’s a long way to the cafeteria.” /yawn\n\n* Political: “Carter can shove his 55 mph speed limit up Billy’s ass!”\n\n* Homophobic: “Bob is a faggot!”\n\n* Combative: “Ford Sucks!” “Astros rule!”\n\n* Religious: “Jesus Saves!”\n\n* Responders: “Moses invests!” or “Your mom!”\n\n* Racists: “[Blank] are living proof the [Blank] fucked [animal name]”\n\n* Trolls/Bullies: “Bob sucks dicks, call him at…”\n\nYou notice something here?  Yeah, so did I.  What we see on Reddit is no different than what we have always seen when people get to write shit anonymously.  To think that all this different type of behavior and content is new to the internet is wrong.\n\nBasically, Reddit is nothing more than a bathroom stall wall with instructions to write on it.  And write on it we do.\n\nYou are never going to stop this type of thinking, this behavior.  The guy that felt compelled to scrawl “Fuck You” has been replaced by younger person with the same need. Those quotes I wrote were written by the dads and grandads of those that are now on Reddit.\n\nSo with this in mind, what Reddit must do is resist the demands to remove it.  You can’t, it’s futile,  But what you can do is marginalize the shit you don’t like.  That’s basically what the down arrow does.  Relegates the poster to “not shown” just like a coat of paint does. (yeah it gets abused but my point is that you can let r/coontown be and marginalize both technology wise and user wise.)\n\nI think it is too late for Reddit, however, based on this statement from Ellen Pao:\n\n&gt; A large portion of the Internet audience enjoys edgy content and the behavior of the more extreme users; it wants to see the bad with the good, so it becomes harder to get rid of the ugly. But to attract more mainstream audiences and bring in the big-budget advertisers, you must hide or remove the ugly.\n\nTo paraphrase  /r/yishan:  Sucks to be you current Redditors, I hope you enjoy YouTube and FaceBook commenters!\n\n\n",

        "text": "On this board and reddit in general, it's very common to generalize reddit based on the idea that you can see which opinions get upvoted and which get downvoted. I agree in theory that this can tell you about trends and majority opinions on reddit.\n\nBut I wonder how much of each individual's beliefs regarding the majority opinions is a product of confirmation bias. It may not actually true when looking at an objective count of upvotes/downvotes/posts but it certainly feels accurate to the individual with the belief.\n\nOne example is the big post about trans rights in Ireland on the front page today with over 4000 comments. The majority of the top posts when sorted by upvotes are supportive and critical of the bigoted posts. Yet, many of those supportive posts seem to believe that they're in the minority on reddit somehow even with all of their upvotes. I understand some of that is due to different posting times (i.e. there may have been more upvoted bigoted posted when they initially posted) but the longer the thread is up on the front page, the more representative it is of reddit's majority. And now that the post has been up for several hours, the top posts clearly indicate that the majority opinion is supportive of trans rights.\n\nYet, many of these people will still walk away from the thread thinking that the majority reddit opinion is anti-trans rights even though that doesn't reflect the reality of the upvotes and posts at all. In fact, it requires completely ignoring the posts that agree with them and focusing on the posts that don't (regardless of the vote totals for each) to confirm a preconceived narrative that makes them feel good (i.e., reddit is bigoted and they are superior).\n\nYou also see this effect with what's dubbed a circlejerk and counterjerk on reddit. I think most people are on-board with the idea that the /r/atheism counterjerk outweighs any /r/atheism circlejerk at this point. But are there others where the backlash against the initial majority opinion has become the new majority? I would bet there's a lot of debate on which opinions that's the case for. For example, I think the anti-STEM counterjerk has grown larger than the pro-STEM circlejerk at this point because for every pro-STEM post, I see 10x the upvotes for a \"DAE LE STEM?!?\" post mocking it.\n\nOf course this could be my own confirmation bias, so I ask how do you come up with what you believe majority opinions on reddit are without selectively reading to fit your own narrative?\n\n**TLDR: People like to generalize reddit. Generalizations without any objective data are very susceptible to confirmation bias. How do you generalize without falling into the confirmation bias trap?**",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3dgl01/sharded_reddit_thought_experiment/",
        "text": "A while ago, I noticed a fair number of commenters opining that the quality of reddit discourse had steadily declined over the life of the site, and that this decline was effectively a function of the number of people using the site: that reddit had gotten too big to sustain good discourse and was now locked in [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September).\n\nThis got me thinking: if we accept this explanation(1), why not improve the site by making (and keeping) it smaller? Here's a very loose thought experiment about how to do that: sharded reddit. \n\nAssume there is some magic number N that is the ideal size for an online community: large enough to sustain itself and generate enough good content, but not so large as to succumb to Eternal September. Further assume that we somehow know what it is.\n\nThe basic idea is that each signed-in user belongs to some shard, which is assigned when the account is created. By default, that user sees only the content, users, subreddits etc. that belong to their shard. As long as the shards have ~N users, then all is well and reddit can accommodate an arbitrary number of users who all have a cozy, small-site experience.\n\nThe problem then is how to allow growth in the userbase. It’s not viable to make people wait to sign up for reddit until there are N people to start a new shard (unless it turns out that N is very low). Here’s a solution: at any given time, there is one shard, randomly chosen, that takes in all new users. Once it hits a certain number of users, say 1.5N (2), it’s split into two new shards of size 0.75N. Each of these new shards starts as a copy of the shard it came from. These two shards are then allowed to grow to N. After they do, a new growth shard is selected. \n\nSome problems and potential solutions:\nQ. What about [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)? Won’t people just end up spamming new accounts to get one in every shard and then using extensions to be everywhere?\n\nA. Maybe, but hopefully not. Non-signed-in users will see content mixed from all the shards, and signed-in users can see content from other shards but not vote or comment. (i.e., content from other shards is automatically np. for you.)\n\nQ. What if I’m in a growth shard and I don’t want to lose access to my friends? What happens to mod teams?\n\nA. It’s reasonable to let people pick which of the new shards they’ll go to so long as the post-split numbers aren’t too unbalanced. Mods of substantial subs should have a little more latitude, to ensure that they can put together a transition plan. Subs that heavily rely on a given individual will end up living in only one of the child shards. It’s probably reasonable to let people shard transfer as long as they can’t use shard transfer as a way to effectively belong to all shards simultaneously.\n\nQ. What about subs with really small subscriber bases, such that splitting them in half would probably kill them?\n\nA. This is an excellent point, especially since the most common advice for finding good discourse on reddit is to subscribe to smaller subs. Perhaps it would be better to shard subs rather than the whole of reddit. (I actually think this is probably a better proposal.) So you’d have just one /r/PizzaProposals, but dozens of /r/Videos.\n\nOne of the interesting side benefits of shards is that they’re an endless supply of natural experiments. Watching the divergence of different shards from a common origin could teach us a lot about how reddit (and other online communities) really work and evolve.\n\n(1) I have no opinion on whether the quality of discourse has declined or whether this is the right diagnosis if so.\n(2) These numbers are for example purposes only. I don’t know what the ‘right’ numbers would be.",

Generally, they can be summed up as \"this is wrong, I am right, here's something I pulled out of my ass to describe why\".\n\nI've noticed this a lot on forums like Worldnews or Politics, but it's also everywhere on Reddit where bullshit is tolerated.\n\nI know how this guy thinks because I've been this guy.  The train of thought is \"I want to participate in this electric atmosphere, but I don't have anything to add.  I'll just say something that sounds vague and smart and then others who had the same thought will upvote it.\"  This is how I obtained a lot of karma on another account of mine.  I call it blood-karma.\n\nAnyway, this is a longstanding problem and I'm sure people have talked about it before.  Clearly there aren't any real solutions right now because they flood the defaults.  I would just like to throw the idea out there to trawl for any breakthroughs or innovations on how to deal with these people.\n\nSo - how do you deal with conmen?",

Especially in this day and age when a motivated attacker / conversation hijacker / ideological asshat can forge their browser signature, their cookies, swap out to one of dozens of other throwaway usernames that have been prepped for months, and bounce out of dozens of relays worldwide in order to avoid IP bans?\n\nThe answer is /r/subredditsimulator.\n\nThe administration of reddit isn't paying an employee to run a funny novelty; they are paying an employee to develop and train a Markov-chain powered Spamfilter heuristic that mathematically, statistically, analyses the characteristics of the writings typified in each of various subreddits. Developing stylistic signatures. Performing author recognition.\n\nThis \"experiment\" has been running, training on data, for months. \n\nThe purpose is to provide a way for AutoModerator to recognise a variety of characteristics of *authors*, of their writing styles.\n\nAll the bullshit lying and misleading Stormfront copypastas? *yank*\n\nDon't have enough karma in order to post or comment in a default subreddit? *yank*\n\nComment enough to gain enough karma to post in a default subreddit?

Not much right now; Google is still struggling with developing image recognition, so reddit is not going to suddenly, magically be able to recognise images of dead kids. It *will* eventually happen, but by the time it does, this will be our children's world. The system *will* likely eventually allow moderators to disable comments that are nothing more than a link to an image, and *definitely* will have a blacklist of URLs (this exists already).\n\nThe new Content Policy will be enforced by the same Spam-filter technology that keeps Spam out of our email inboxes.\n\n--------------- \n\nSeparate hypothesis:\n\nThey will *almost certainly* need to introduce a change to the way voting works, in order to choke out vote brigaders harassing users anonymously — in order to vote on comments, you're going to have to get voted on positively by the community *at large*, up to a certain threshold — effectively having the community vet new user accounts.\n\nIn addition, if you and an insular group of friends all pretty much exclusively vote-jerk each other in one or three subreddits, and no-one else does — congrats, that won't qualify you, because you're not being trusted/vetted by the community *at large*.\n\n-----------------\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nAutoModerator will soon have the ability to target the typical writings and copypastas of ideological hate groups;  \n\nThere's going to almost certainly be a change or expansion in the works for evaluating how much the system should trust users, based on their writings as well as their voting histories (given and received);\n\nKicking /r/FatPeopleHate off the site and dealing with the following \"user revolt\" provided the administration with a perfect testbed for the enforcement tools.\n\nNow we wait and see.",

So what purpose did it serve for him to say otherwise?\n\nI think that clearly reddit has changed a lot since it was founded 10 years ago - the site has a much larger and more diverse userbase now. Monetization is also a more pressing problem now. It's no longer the small pet project of a couple of guys mostly accessed by people in the tech industry with a rather high barrier to entry. The community was much smaller and tighter-knit. So while reddit could promote relatively unrestricted speech.\n\nInstead of going back on his past words Ohanian could have said something like this: \"While I intended for reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the community has changed dramatically since I started the website. Unfortunately, many people who have used the site took advantage of our rules and created a hostile environment we never intended.\"\n\nPersonally, while I think reddit's free speech ideals worked in the beginning, I think the site has changed to make it unfeasible. But it was definitely intended to be a bastion of free speech when it was started.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I was shocked that surveys showed that 80% of respondents were white. Even on /r/anime a survey showed that 70% of respondents were white. I was slightly shocked. And the probably played into many people's perceptions that Reddit is predominately White, male, and young.\n\nAnd from this data people were led to believe that Reddit is not welcoming to people who are non-white. Maybe the reason why so many Redditors are white is because other races are oppressed and don't feel welcome. Maybe Reddit content is just suited more for white people.\n\nWell the truth is that 77.7% of Americans are also White. So while people may think it is significant that 80% of reddit is white, it really isn't a problem.\n\nSome minorities may come from minority neighbourhoods so they don't realize how white the US is. Also some white people probably don't know how white the US is.\n\nWhile Reddit may be 80% white, I don't think it's a huge problem. It's quite normal. Also just because Reddit is predominately white does not mean anything about racism. Being white doesn't make you a racist.\n\nEthnicity | Fitness 2011 | Fitness 2014 | Anime 2014 | TIA 2015 | US (2013) | Canada\n---|---|----|----|---- |---|---\nWhite | 80.20% | 79.75% | 70.4% | 83.5% | 77.7%|76.7%\nAmerican, Indian or Alaskan Native | 0.40% | 0.40% | 1.9% | 0.8% | 1.2%|4.3%\nAsian or Pacific | 9.70% | 10.50% | N/A | 6.4% | 5.5% | 11.4%\nEast Asian | N/A | N/A | 18.1% | 3.6% | N/A | 4.8%\nSouth Asian | N/A | N/A | 6.5% | 1.8% | N/A | 4.8%\nMiddle Eastern | N/A | N/A | 2% | 1% | N/A | 1.8%\nBlack\t | 1.00% | 1.31% | 2.7% | 1.5% | 13.2% | 2.9%\nHispanic | 4.30% | 4.02% | 6.6% | 1.8% | 17.1% | 1.2%\nOther (includes mixed) | 4.40% | 3.32% | 3.3% | 6% | 2.4% | 0.8%\n\n\\* Note for /r/anime survey 1.9% responded as Japanese (I included it in East Asian).

        "text": "So, like most redditors I've been following the developments and changes that have happened over the last few days. In watching all of this unfold, I've started to wonder about reddit's Board of Directors -- mainly its composition and its authority/power. Having served on the board of two relatively large companies, the way reddit's board *seems* to be portrayed is starkly different from the boards I've served on (full disclosure: the boards I served on were non-profits, though the larger company was run similar to a for-profit corporation).  \n\n- Most BoDs focus on three main areas: 1) hiring and firing a chief executive who manages the day-to-day operations of the corporation; 2) creating/adopting the annual budget (often at the recommendation of the chief executive, with slight alterations); and, 3) long range planning and setting the \"vision\" of the company. \n\nIt seems that this is the role of reddit's board, per /u/samaltman's comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cudmx/i_am_sam_altman_reddit_board_member_and_president/csz2k1o).\n&gt; Your job as a board member is to hire and fire the CEO, approve the annual financial plan, and help the executive team set the strategic direction.\n\nAccording to a reddit blog post [from two years ago](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/08/reddit-myth-busters_6.html), reddit's board consisted of 3 members: /u/kn0thing (as co-founder), Bob Sauerberg (as President of Conde Nast), and the CEO (at that time /u/yishan). In 2014, a year after that blog post, reddit raised $50 million in a funding round led by /u/samaltman, who we know now serves on the board. I'd assume (though could be wrong) that Bob is still on the board, and I'd imagine that other investors may have also been made board members. But we simply don't know. Following /u/yishan's resignation as CEO, Alexis was bumped up to \"Executive Chairman\" meaning he may have had some duties outside of the usual role of a board chairman (via [NYTimes](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/reddit-chief-executive-resigns-as-company-shuffles-top-ranks/), he was overseeing marketing, communications, and strategy). \n\n\nTo my questions: \n\n\n* **Who is serving on reddit's Board of Directors -- and how many Directors are there?** \n\nThis is important, because the board sets the strategic direction of the company. In reddit's case, this strategic direction will likely involve what kind of content is acceptable and what kind isn't. If the board is actually comprised of three (or four) directors, the vision set forth by the board, in my opinion, would be very narrow. Especially when two of the three (or four) directors are co-founders of the organization, and the other director(s) are heavily invested actors. While obviously those investors have a very serious right to steer the direction of their investment, a board of three or four members seems very limited.\n\n\n* **What is the role of reddit's Board of Directors?** \n\n\nThis, I think, is the more important question, and it doesn't seem clear. If reddit's board is actually following that \"tried-and-true\" role of hiring the CEO, budgeting, and strategic planning, then why was a board member (/u/kn0thing) involved in the firing of an employee -- even if he was executive chairman? That's an operational decision and traditionally handled by the CEO, if reddit was operating as a traditionally structured company. If /u/kn0thing's role as executive chairman was directly in competition with the CEO, that's a horrible structure for a company -- it's not even the tail wagging the dog, it's a dog with two heads unsure of which car it wants to chase. \n\n\nAnother area the board seemingly overstepped their intender role (per /u/samaltman's description) was pointed out by /u/yishan [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc).\n&gt; on at least two separate occasions, the board pressed /u/ekjp to outright ban ALL the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge\n\n\nAgain, that is an *operational* decision, unless it is the part of a much larger strategic direction the board sought to take reddit in -- but that almost certainly isn't the case, because if it was /u/ekjp would've been fired by the board for not following the direction they put forth. (This kind of strategic direction would take months to compile, and it seems clear right now the reddit board has no clear strategic vision in place). \n\n\nIn a post, /u/samaltman described [what a bad board member looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cudmx/i_am_sam_altman_reddit_board_member_and_president/csz2k1o), saying:\n&gt; Very bad board members try to do the CEO's job.\n\n\nFrom what I can tell -- and I may be wrong -- reddit's Board of Directors were doing the job of the CEO. As a result, we've ended up with an interim-CEO resigning, a new CEO being appointed overnight, a former CEO criticizing the board and co-founders, and a reddit community extremely confused by all that is going on. \n\n\n /u/yishan concluded [one of his posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc?context=3) saying, \"We tried to let you govern yourselves and you failed,\" commenting on how redditors attacked on Pao, ultimately leading to her resignation, and the appointment of /u/spez. While Yishan may be correct, it appears to me (and I hope to have some discussion on this) that reddit as a corporation failed to follow its own internal governing procedures. \n\nThoughts on this, and the impact it may have on the community?\n\n**TL;DR** - the structure of reddit's board of directors is unclear, and it seems to play an important role in the future of how reddit will operate. How do we get more information about the board and its intended role?",

        "text": "[This article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-is-not-the-front-page-of-the-internet.html) discusses Reddit's skewed demographics in a dozen different ways, without much analysis of why approximately three-quarters of Reddit users are male. I don't think there's any evidence or investigation into why this is the case, but it seems like there are three potential, probably, and likely overlapping causes.\n\n1. Reddit's content is overwhelmingly male-oriented: Traditionally, Reddit has been a geek site above all else. In 2009, [a quarter of the defaults were tech-related](https://www.reddit.com/r/defaults/comments/34p4v3/list_of_default_subreddits_december_31_2009/), soon to be joined by /r/atheism and /r/technology. Moreover, these areas tend to almost always bleed into other subreddits. /r/politics and /r/news disproportionately deal with STEM issues (like internet censorship or space travel), and it's very common for somewhat technical material to crop up in any subreddit. For reasons that I don't care to discuss, these areas tend to be dominated by young men and teenage boys. I'm sure that there are just as many people interested in makeup or skincare than in hardcore gaming, but /r/makeupaddiction and /r/skincareaddiction have never been defaulted, and are dwarfed in terms of subscribership. I'm quite sure that tons of potential female Reddit users (as well as many men) are turned-off by the defaults before they find any cool subreddits that they might prefer. Reddit can be difficult to navigate early on, especially because subreddits are really only spread by word-of-mouth.\n\n2. Reddit's format is alienating to women: This is probably the less plausible, given the huge amount of young women on similar sites like Pinterest or Tumblr. But because Reddit has more of a bare-bones style than other sites, I could maybe believe that it only really appeals to nerdier people more familiar with forums than with social networks, and these people tend to be overwhelmingly young and male. Some older men I know, who have stumbled onto Reddit for whatever reason, have complained about how the site is \"god-awful\" because of its layout and somewhat boring color scheme. \n\n3. Reddit is hostile to women: This is a tough one. Reddit has a problem with its sexism, and I really don't think this can be denied. I don't think the majority of Reddit users have any negative feelings toward women, as I've heard some people argue, but there often can be an underlying anti-women attitude, which is especially common on more conservative subs like /r/mensrights, /r/kotakuinaction, or even /r/askmen. The humor is bro-ish, \"Is your wife single?\" jokes always get upvoted, and sexual humor is considered high-brow. There is of course the matter of subreddits like /r/punchingwomen and /r/theredpill, which are explicitly misogynistic, but I honestly don't believe that these subs would alienate mass numbers of women. Those subreddits are so niche that they're discussed much more often than their material is promoted, and there are similar anti-women all over the internet. I think that a much bigger problem is Reddit's generally bro-ish attitude. This attitude certainly makes a ton of women uncomfortable, and this attitude is ironically the result of reddit being a boys' club. If as many women voted on comments as men, discussion would be incredibly different. \n\nAre there other potential reasons for Reddit's odd userbase?",

There’s no mass movement forming to apologize to Pao for wrongly targeting her.\n\nCould it be that perhaps Taylor’s firing wasn’t the real reason so many were angry at Pao?\n\nCould it be that her haters actually hated her not because of the firing but because she was taking small steps to curb the worst excesses of Reddit’s poisonous culture? That she was a woman standing up to some of the angry boys of Reddit?\"\n\nArticle: http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/07/14/so-it-wasnt-ellen-pao-who-fired-that-popular-reddit-staffer-after-all-but-the-angry-mob-isnt-apologizing/\n\nMy question is: can we basically sum up all of the vitriol against Pao over the past few months to be a majority based around sexism and racism? Would this extreme level of harassment and just horrific postings be going on if Ohanian had been the CEO? Would there be a \"Chairman Pao\" hashtag equivalent given to him?\n\nOr is the higher amount of anger about all of this in a major sense because she is a woman and, to a more minor extent, because she isn't white? How much of Reddit's culture and community is based around this racism and sexism?\n\nIf yes to all of the above, is there any way to fix this, to better this culture and community? I'm not sure if I personally have any answers to that. ",

        "text": "Hi, ToR. Blackstar9000 here. You might remember me from such \"created by\" fields as this sub. It's been a little over a year since I stopped participating on this site, but the recent staffing shake-up has, naturally, drawn my attention. In particular, this post was inspired by a [recent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv3/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1gokj) /u/davidreiss666 made, and which has made the rounds on a few other social media platforms. I'm mostly in agreement with what David wrote there, but have to take issue with a sentence toward the end:\n\n&gt; If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.\n\nI'm not sure the past is very reassuring on that count. Media scrutiny has, in fact, driven the admins to make changes in the past, but those changes tend to be very localized. If Anderson Cooper makes a fuss about a particular subreddit, then the admins will make a special exception and close down that sub—but the policies that allowed that sub to grow into a problem in the first place? Those remain.\n\nThe rationale offered for most of this is usually Reddit's self-declared stance on free speech, though I suspect that it's just as much a cost-saving measure as a stand on principle. And, anyway, I'm not entirely convinced that speech is really the issue here. We're not just talking about a person's right to wonder aloud if maybe the bell curve wasn't right after all. We're talking about subreddits created to organize harassment. They're not merely expressing unpopular ideas (and, because they attract a certain demographic to the site, they're becoming less and less *un*popular). Rather, their function is to capitalize on the voting system in order to push antagonizing images and messages toward enough popularity that mixed audiences will find it difficult to avoid them. That was made stunningly clear last week in the way that protest over the dismissal of Victoria Taylor rapidly morphed into harassment of Ellen Pao, complete with racist and sexist imagery on the front page. The problem is not speech, but rather behaviors—intimidation, harassment, witch-hunting—that manipulate our commitment to the principle of free speech as a smoke screen for perpetuating hate and discrimination.\n\nThat's why I think Huffman's plan of [quarantining content](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/cszuhho) is unlikely to work. The groups that start aggressively offensive subs aren't likely to stand quietly in the corner. If they didn't want non-subscribers to see what they were posting, they'd have already set their subs to private, right? Visibility is part of Reddit's basic attraction, and if they can't be visible in their own subs, chances are they'll develop strategies for moving posts up the queue in more mainstream subs. More than an actual solution, quarantine sounds like a way to sweep the dirt under a rug, so that it's less visible to the news media.\n\nEven so: as I stated above, relying on the media to force change in the house of Reddit is probably dim hope at best. If you want the admins to take a stronger stance toward those behaviors, redditors themselves need to take action. And, as circumstance would have it, the recent shake-up has shown you what can be done. Two point, in particular, are worth highlighting:\n\n1. Organization on the user and moderator level is effective at pushing the admins and executive board to action. In the case of the anti-Pao protests, the outcome was (IMO) negative. It led to the resignation of a CEO who has actually worked to combat the very behaviors I'm talking about, and the subsequent revelation that she wasn't even responsible for the staffing change that was the ostensible cause behind those protests. Nevertheless, it should be clear that mobilizing the userbase can be an effective way of promoting change from within, and if that can be used for bad, then it can also be used for good.\n2. One of the primary concerns of the admins and board is increasing the site's potential revenue by growing its userbase at a particular rate. They are, it would seem, so intent on that, that they're willing to tolerate a great deal of abuse so long as the abusers don't jump ship for Voat or Digg or wherever. And the main concern behind the quarantine plan is keeping those users around while, at the same time, keeping them from driving off other users, both current and potential. That is your leverage.\n\nWhat it would take, I think, is something like the blackouts you orchestrated against Pao. Given the historic tension between moderators and average users, though, I'm not sure a middle-out approach will work. Rather, what you'd need is a mass walk-out—**both mods and ordinary redditors stepping away from the site at the same time.** That would mean no posting, no moderating, no logging in—not even checking the site, since that would generate page views. (Okay, so maybe restrict yourself to checking the front page once a day, if you can't go cold turkey.)\n\nI'm not necessarily talking about deleting your accounts or swearing off Reddit indefinitely. The point here is to demand a change of policies, so it would be sufficient to stay off of the site until those policies change. At the very least, I'd recommend setting it for a period of one week, so that users who just can't keep away will at least have a discrete goal to shoot for. If you think a pithy name would help, call it Cold Turkey Week.\n\nThe message, of course, would be that Reddit has more to lose by continuing to court hate groups with its weak policies concerning organized abuse than it does by holding the site to a higher standard. At the same time, if enough redditors were to participate, it would also serve as a striking demonstration (both to the board and to outside observers) of what the site might look like if those groups continue to make up an increasingly large portion of its population. In either case, it would touch the power-that-be right where they're most sensitive—right in the business.\n\nIs that sort of protest possible? I don't know. By the time I decided to take an indefinite break from Reddit, I was already pretty pessimistic about the possibility of this site's users driving change from within. The anti-Pao protests suggest that it's still possible. The question, then, is whether that only happens when the mob lashes out over surmise and misinformation, or if it can also be done with a clear-sighted focus on a positive goal.\n\nAnyway, good luck! Blackstar out.",

It seemed to place the blame for all of Reddit's problems on someone who was CEO for under a year.\n\nI had the idea for this post before kn0thing said that he decided to change AMAs. Now I'm even more bewildered. How did the Pao-hate movement gain so much traction without any evidence?\n\nI wrote the next several paragraphs before taking a break to check Reddit, where I found a [partial answer to my question](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/csz2p3i).\n\nMaybe they come from different groups of people, but two of their ideas don't seem to mix:\n\n* Pao is a swindler whose lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers was for money, not for any kind of feminist cause. Pao does not actually believe in having women in the workplace. Kleiner evidence showed she rated female employees negatively.\n* Pao is such a pro-feminism zealot that she is personally responsible for two of Reddit's most unpopular recent actions:\n * The (all-but-confirmed) firing of Victoria Taylor, the Reddit employee responsible for communicating between I Am A mods and celebrities\n * The removal of certain subreddits, most notable Fat People Hate. The announcement for this removal said that Reddit was policing actions, not ideas, and said that the banned subreddits brought harassment those features on each subreddit.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, I don't understand how Pao could be blamed for Victoria's firing. Was Victoria the only one fired that day? Do CEOs usually personally involve themselves in employee firing? Reddit is a small company, yes, but is the CEO micromanaging to the point that they pick which employees stay and which ones go? If Pao did make the final call, isn't it probable that other managers gave advice and data that led to that decision? *Is this entirely Ellen Pao's fault?*\n\n---\n\nOkay, I wrote all that before finding out that Alexis Ohanian (kn0thing) says that \"[i]t was my decision to change how we work with AMAs\".\n\nBut the mismatch remains. Can Pao be a feminist who also doesn't believe in feminism? What was the point of cleaning up the subreddits, something which made Reddit less nice to use (constant FPH posts on /r/all)? The accusation is that it's either for ad money or for a social-justice cause. The ads have not come, not yet at least. That leaves social justice coming from someone who the anti-Pao crowd certifies as a fraud.\n\n---\n\nWas every gripe against Reddit rolled into one anti-Pao package for convenience, and to unite behind a common message? Or was it a more sinister [co-opting](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3c58qc/has_the_recent_movement_in_reaction_to_victorias/)? Was subtlety lost out of convenience, or out of malice?\n\nOver and over again, Reddit has gotten itself worked up without any supporting evidence. (See: Boston Marathon bombings, basically any headline on /r/politics or /r/gaming.) The communities seem to revel in this careless approach to fact-finding. Make the accusation first, get thousands of points, and if a correction is posted, it never gets the traction the original did.\n\n/r/Games is nice enough to tag posts as rumors. That's a start.",

        "text": "[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/IlxaQ3G.png)\n\n---\n\nData source is the [BigQuery interface for /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix's](https://np.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/) data dump of the comments. Specifically, this query:\n\n\tSELECT\n\t  score,\n\t  AVG(LENGTH(body)) as avg_comment_length,\n\t  STDDEV(LENGTH(body))/SQRT(COUNT(score)) as se_comment_length,\n\t  COUNT(score) as num_comments\n\t FROM {{list of all comment tables}}\n\t GROUP BY score\n\t ORDER BY score \n\nTook only 3 seconds to execute! (and 1/4th of the monthly free BigQuery quota!)\n\nTool is R/ggplot2. Shaded areas represent a 95% confidence interval for the true average at each discrete score value.\n\nThere's a slight positive relationship between score and comment length, although the relationship is less clear when the score is 1000+, due to a relative lack of data (which is the reason I did not expand the chart much beyond that threshold). What I didn't immediately expect is that the average comment length for comments with a negative score is much. much lower.\n\nData and code for generating the chart is [available in this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/minimaxir/reddit-comment-length).",
