Here’s a short one. \n\n$Me: me\n\n$user: User\n\nSo one of the things I get to do as tier 1 is sending tickets for account unlocks on software we don’t have access to do. Today was one of those calls. Standard practice with most accounts is 30 days then disabled and after 45 days it gets deleted. \n\nHere comes my next call....(dun dun DUNNNNN)\n\n$Me: Thank you for calling IT. How may I help?\n\n$User: yeah my account is locked. \n\n$Me: I’ll be happy to put in a ticket. Out of curiosity how long ago did you last log in?\n\n$User: July 5th. Why?\n\n$Me: I see. The policy for this account states that after 30 days it will be disabled. \n\n$User: that’s crazy! \n\n$Me: I’m sorry? \n\n$User: Well yesterday was Sunday I didn’t think that counted.\n\n$Me: ........\n\nI explain to her that weekends are included in the policy and advise her to login every two weeks aka payday if she doesn’t regularly use the software as a reminder before putting in the ticket and sending her on her way. \n\nTLDR: User didn’t think weekends were part of days and as a result her account is disabled. \n",

(They're not the most tech literate) The computer they had it hooked up to died and they got rid of the monitor, but kept the tower. \n\nThey didnt realize that the tower was useless without the power and just left the modem hooked up to a lone tower.  I had to explain to them that leaving it hooked up to a tower is pointless and definitely doesnt increase the speed of the wifi. \n\nThey all laughed and felt silly afterwards, and I got steak as a reward.

        "text": "In the year or so leading up to the millennium, it was all over the news about Y2k. Lots of people were afraid we were going to be thrown back into the dark ages, because most computer programs at that time only coded the date as 2 characters instead of 4, and some other math that I'm sure much more intelligent folks than me can explain. Suffice to say, people were doomsday prepping left and right.  New Year rolls around, and, thanks to the heroics of some amazing folks (I know a few of the coders who worked to keep the dark ages away) nary a peep was heard except...\n\nThe date was January 2nd, 2000. I was fresh out of high school and working in the Service Center of a bovine inspired computer company. In walks a man with his tower, sets it down on the counter, and says his CD isn't working.  No problem, we are here to help. \n\nI grab the serial number off the back, and turn the tower around so the front faces me, when I see it. The front of the plastic case is shattered. Turning the case to look at the \"left\" side (the side that opened) I saw a hole, right about the right size for a bullet holes. I looked up at the customer, back at the computer, then sweetly asked home to wait a min. I ran in back and grabbed the techs, swearing it would be worth it, but not saying anything else. \n\nWe arrive back up front, my three techs look on in wonder, and we all look at the customer who has gone very quiet. He explained he thought the end of the world was near so he stocked up on food water and about 30 Russian SKSs with sundry amo.  His son, who had some mental health issues, had gotten one of his possibly illegally modified SKSs and sprayed the whole living room down.  No casualties, except the walls and the tower.\n\nTook it back, cracked the case. The bullet had missed everything except it nicked the IDE cable. We replaced it on the spot, buttoned it back up, and that ladies and gents, was our only Y2k issue.\n",

        "text": "It was a lazy Thursday, about 1 pm in the afternoon, and I had just come back from a delicious taco lunch. One of my duties is to chase down TSM backup failures from the night before, figure out why they didn't run, and run a one-time, just in case. I had a list of 5 and had worked my way through 2 already. Fired up the 3rd.\n\nI'm happily reading um... training materials, let's go with that,  as a one time runs, when the senior VP of IT ($SVP) comes to my desk. Now, at my company, it's a pretty nice place, and I have had a few pleasent conversations with $SVP, so I took off my headphones and gave him a smile. He did not return the smile...uh oh.\n\n$SVP: Are you running any TSM stuff right now?\n\n$me: Well, yes, there's lots going on right now...what's up?\n\nI trailed off and looked at him expectantly. \n\n$SVP: Are you running anything in DMZ?\n\nNow, we have a DMZ zone that keeps our outside customers from accessing internal resources. TSM is one of the few applications that can get to both areas.\n\n$me: Well, let me check.\n\nI looked up the server I was running a one time on and low and behold it was a DMZ server, and so was the previous one as well, but I still had no idea why that would matter. I confirmed for $SVP that yes I was running a backup on a DMZ server.\n\n$SVP: Stop that immediately. Why would you run those during the day??!?! Nothing should be run during the day!!\n\n$me: Well, I can stop what I'm doing but this is standard procedure for us, and up until today, have never had an issue. What's going on?\n\n$SVP: Come with me!\n\nWell, I'm fairly certain I'm not going to get fired, but I still had no idea what the heck was going on. He takes me to the network wizard area, and the wizards are all in an uproar. Outside internet access has been unavailable for the last 45 min, and they had just narrowed it down to TSM traffic taking all the bandwidth. The SVP was adamant that we never do another one time backup during the day. I asked that we not be so hasty and let's figure out what happened first. \n\nThe head network wizard finally looks up from his frantic casting, I mean typing, and explains: In order for traffic to get to the DMZ, it had to leave our Network at 10gb, go through the 1gb PAN, through the 450mb Blue Coat to the DMZ, then back. All traffic, including outside access to the internet was routed this way. In kicking off a 20gn and 6gb backup respectively, I had wiped out the pipe, company wide, for the last 45 min. We are a bank so outside access may be important for things like wire transfers, loan applications, YouTube surfing, you know, important stuff.\n\nThe $SVP again tried to say no more backups during the day. I said fine, but what happens when I have to restore that 6tb production database that's vital to the feds? I actually heard his brain do a record skip. I explained that the backups were just the symptom, and to avoid this in the future, I won't do any one-time DMZ backups during the day, but if I have to restore production, I'm taking the pipe down again and I don't care for how long. He is a good $SVP and listened. He turned to the Networking Director and asked why this was an issue. Turns out the director didn't want to put new equipment on this year's budget for whatever reason (it's not like we have budget issues, still don't have an explanation on that one), and things were slated to be replaced next year. \n\nNet, net, no moving of files, or backups during the day, or messing with DMZ at all during business hours unless it's a restore. $SVP apologized for not waiting for the whole story, and for jumping in to say it was my fault before all the facts were in. I can now put on my resume that I encreased employee productivity by 75% by removing outside distractions, company wide. ",

        "text": "So this happened a few years back. It was technically before I was full on tech support. I was more of a hardware engineer at the time. \n\nI was working for a company that did third party repair of POS for food chains and a few other random retail locations across the country. This particular retail was based on the west coast, and our facility was in the midwest.\n\n$Shady- Me\n\n$Broken- Client\n\n$Idiot- My manager\n\n$Wraith- My lead/subtle genius\n\nThe phone in our workshop rings one day, and it's $idiot. She calls to tell us that she just got of the phone with a client and that they had a POS that had a broken screen and needed repaired ASAP. She assured them that if they overnighted it, we could have it done the next day, and back on a truck within 24 hours. Keep in mind, we have no idea what they are sending us, how bad it is, or anything else. She was infamous for doing this to us, as she had no tech background what so ever. \n\nFast forward to the next day, and there is a giant box waiting for us in our workshop. $Wraith and I break it open, ready to get to work on this thing, and we just stand there in utter disbelief.  What we saw, was a POS that was broken in 3 pieces, with a screen that not only had a boot print on it, but what looked a lot like a bullet hole, too. \n\nWe immediately call, $Idiot to the back to look at this thing. She comes back and take s a look and asks us what the problem is. We gently explain to her that it isn't something we can fix, as all the mounts are broken, the screen has a thru and thru hole, and the base looks like it took a good old fashion beating, too. She goes off the rails, as she often did, and started ranting about how we had a contract with the client and if we broke the SLA, that we'd have to pay out a bunch of money, etc, etc. She then told us that we would have to talk to the client when they called back in and explain to them that we couldn't do it.\n\nShe locked herself in her office for the rest of the day, and wouldn't talk to us, or the client when they called, so it came to us. We put him on speaker, and talked to him about how it was beyond broken, with boot prints, bullet holes and who knows what else. we also mentioned that it was packed poorly, with no package protection. It was literally just tossed in a box and sent to us. He went on about how we did all that damage, and he wasn't going to eat the cost of it, etc, etc. \n\nEventually, we got the Company owner involved, and there were some legal things that happened. Long story short, we didn't pay for it, and $idiot was moved to manager over shipping, while my buddy $wraith became the manager over repair. \n\nNo moral or anything here, just a reminder of how stupid people can be.",

        "text": "Part three of the quest to fix the unfixable. Today: How not to support.\n\n\nEverything written happened a few years ago and I have left behind the workplace for (somehow related) other reasons. \nThe first part can be found [here](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/91ifcg/the_cabinet_of_horrors_part_i_discoveries/).\n\n\nThe second part can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/92ctmv/the_cabinet_of_horros_part_ii_the_cleaners/).\n\n\nAfter the hassle and subsequent crowding of the $boss's office with old prototypes everything was back to normal. The old server did indeed serve. The co-workers were pleased with a set of second monitors (seriously, who is still programming with only one [not ultra wide]?). The interns did their best to get rid of the corporate junk and I could start working again and finished a cost sheet for the new server and installations.\n\n\nMonday morning before my first tea my company provided phone rings. Nobody would ever call that since I am quite new. On the display some weird foreign number. Preparing to waste time of a scammer I picked it up:\n\n\n&gt; Hello, this is Luesterklemme from $company, how can I help you on this fine Monday morning?\n\n\n&gt; Hello, this is $supportingPerson (SP) from you soon to be parent parent company. We will be doing your IT support from now on.\n\n\n&gt; Oh, nice. I didn't know we were bought. Sounds good, so I can be an engineer again. What do you need of me and when will you start here?\n\n\n&gt; I will need all the passwords for the network equipment and servers. You don't need to do anything. And what do you mean start? I started already.\n\n\n&gt; I mean like on premise. In this office. In person.\n\n\n&gt; Yeah I won't be doing that. We will support you remotely.\n\n\n&gt; Ok, I think we might run into problems here. This office needs new stuff installed and I can think of a dozent things that can and will go wrong that needs somebody to interact with the problem physically. In the case you don't have the power of telekinesis I am pretty much in doubt.\n\n\n&gt; Leave that to us. We are professionaly and you are not the first office we are supporting. \n\n\n&gt; *metaphorical jazz hands*\n\n\nAfter that weird call I got and email matching the name from the phone with a corporate provided email adress. Huh? No scam? Somebody must be playing a joke? Not the first of April either. Shouting to boss he denies any involvment and confirms the buy out story. My week was going to get intersting again but not in a good way. \n\n\nSo you might suspect where this is going. In this first week the Eldritch Gods tried to purge all sanity from the office. Not only did I lose all the admin accesses (at least officially, of course I made spare accounts beforehand and nobody bothered to check...), the server project got pushed back and as the icing on the Cthulu shaped cake that little Linux server was abruptly shut down because \"it was reachable from the outside\". That's the whole point of a server but I digress. \n\n\nAs first meaure I got a remote root server I was not intending giving the support guys any access (or even knowledge of the existence) and tried to keep on networking as if nothing changed. Because I am a nice person I tried to make it work full knowing it will end up in an epic supernova of networking FUBAR. Any mentioning that for some work somebody has to be present was ignored and the whole support was plastered with guidelines, tickets and restrictions. The change of some alias email adresses on the SMTP took them the better part of a week and it didn't even work. \n\n\nThe engineers started to get unhappy and always diligently pointed to the support sitting in another country and after a couple days of ticket ping pong did it myself as support support. I also logged all the wasted hours I spent, faults and wrongs they did and instances where they could do nothing (restarting a network switch. Still no telekinesis?) and readied myself for the final blow.\n\n\nOn the following week Tuesday morning I informed my co-workers there might be network connectivity problems and instructed them to rely on the networks stuff as little as possible. I logged in a provided some critical points with static IPs (except for $boss's laptop of course). From the depth of the abyss then rose a little network switch. Drawing my runes and symbols I connected it to the network. I stirred the sleep of the thing that should not be. I took another network cable, plugged it in and in my satanic ritual plugged it in again. \n\n\nWhat followed was a evil storm of stray DHCP packets. The hail of new and not so new device information kicked and reconnected all DHCP devices in a endless downward spiral until the end of time. I imagined the control dashboard of the supporters I supported like a infernal christmas tree where all lights started blinking red and green and maybe yellow too. My colleagues were warned and I sat back and played the waiting game. \n\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I get a frantic call from the other office.\n\n\n&gt; Hey, what is happening with you office? I can only sporadically reach you?\n\n\nFeigning ignorance:\n&gt; Oh, I don't know? I've seen it work with some devices. The printers are fine. Internet works for some too? \n\n\n&gt; Can you have a look that the firewall is correcly configured or apply a backup?\n\n\n&gt; Sorry ~~Dave~~ I cannot do that. I have no access. \n\n\n&gt; Oh. And is ther server still ok?\n\n\n&gt; It is still running. Everything else is your job. I can't log in, I have no access. \n\n\n&gt; Sh...I will think of something. Talk to you later...  *click*\n\n\nSmirking I went back to work. $boss came around and asked what was happening and all the pieces of my plan fell together.\n\n\n&gt; Yeah we have network outages. Can't tell whats happening but I guess today is gonna be no good day to get work done on the shares. Sorry.\n\n\n&gt; Can't you do something?\n\n\n&gt; Nope. Not my responsibility. \n\n\nAfter lunch (4 hours of outage so far) I get another call.\n\n\n&gt; Hey Luesterklemme, I've got a solution: You get you cell phone and tether the cell service to a laptop, you connect the RS232 to the firewall and I remote in to solve the problem!\n\n\n&gt; Okay.\n\n\nI really wanted to see that since the storage cabinet had barely any reception but I gave it my best shot. After setting everything up $SP went to work and after a few hours of agonizingly slow debugging went home after calling and telling he found nothing (no, really?) and we should all tether our phones. I waited another 30 minutes and put Cthulu back in its slumber. \n\n\nThe deed was done. The storm was over. Sluggish DHCP packeges oozed back to their place. And none of the remote support where any wiser what caused the outage. I readied my weapons for the full frontal assault and got the accesses back and the renewals of the plans for the new server in about 2 weeks of discussions and my biggest backer was $boss after I calculated (in management calculations) what that outage had cost us and will in the future when the server follows Cthulu and loses its mind.\n\n\nAnd of course that was not the final part since that little server that could still served and now also the parent parent company wanted to play ball. But that is another story for another time. \n\n\n\n",

My mom is often overwhelmed by technology's quirks. (She learned punch-card computing in university, but modern systems are mysteries to her.) I know how to solve computer quirks and can even code a little, so I get to help.\n\nOur family recently upgraded our phone plans to a new set of phones with \"cool new features for your convenience\". I made sure that mom and I got the same type of phone so I could help her. I don't have time to set up my phone right away, as I'm travelling to another city, so I decide to set it up when I get there.\n\nUnfortunately, I had forgotten to pack the new phone, and the old phone's contract expired. I bought a cheap month-to-month plan because I would be home in a couple weeks. This plan only allows local calls, and my parents are not in the local calling area. Mom does not like to text.\n\nI suggest that we use $CielVideoCall instead. Mom agrees, and we both log on. It's a program we don't use often. We didn't realize $CielVideoCall had been integrated into $ThatComputerCompany's database, meaning that all the old user information had been wiped. That included contacts.\n\nI end up finding her fairly quickly. The usernames were now the name assigned to the computer, meaning that if you use a weird computer username, it matches. I send her a contact request and a message on the app, and switch my profile photo to a photo of our dog. I text her asking if she got the request. She says she hasn't. I try messaging her on the app another time. No reply.\n\nAt this point I try to find my dad's $CielVideoCall profile. I find it, send him a contact request, and he adds me. Great! They can both talk to me from his laptop computer. I call.\n\nProblem solved, right?\n\nIf it was, it wouldn't be on this subreddit. Mom brings Dad's computer to the office and balances it against something so I can help her figure out why it's not working. The video capture is not kind to her screen - it's too overexposed to read the text well, but I can kind of see the colors.\n\n$Mom: It keeps telling me to buy something.\n\n$Me: That's not the program, that's the website. You do not need a premium subscription. Close that and go back to the program. Now click the big blue button on the left to bring up -\n\n$Mom: It's brought up the payment window again. I don't want to give them my money.\n\nMe: You're clicking the wrong place.\n\nI try to direct her through the steps, using screen-share mode as a guide. Dad helps with the instructions too.  She still can't find me.\n\nIt's quite late at this point, and we have many other things to discuss, so I just tell her to call $CielVideoCall tech support the next morning.\n\nThe problem never really got solved. I think I might have to look at her account the next time I visit.",

        "text": "I've never posted here so IDK if this counts. I'll try to keep it short.\n\nAbout 4 years ago in College, I was in a fraternity whose chapter I helped start. I won't give the name here, but this wasn't a party fraternity or anything, it was pretty heavily focused on community service and actually forbade drinking at all official meetings and functions. That's not really important to the story, but it gives you an idea about the kind of group we were. Anyways, part of our pledge process involved a presentation that the pledge needed to make and present to the brothers, usually about the history of our organisation. We didn't expect a whole lot, we just expected them to A) get facts right, and B) actually do it.\n\nWell, during my Junior year one kid (we'll call him $PK for Pledge Kid) was being a pain about pretty much anything we asked him to do. To be clear nothing was \"Crazy Pledge Stuff\", we're talking 'do a few hours of community service' and 'have conversations with all the available brothers', and he'd always have some kind of excuse. Eventually, $PK was assigned his presentation, and come the night of, he says he doesn't have it. The discussion went like this:\n\n*$PK:* \"I made my presentation today,, but Power Point  closed before I could save it, and now its gone!\"  \n*Fraternity President ($FP):* \"Do you think you could present if you had the slides?\"  \n*$PK:* \"Definitely, I remember most of the talking points.\"  \n*$FP:* \"Sounds good. $Brother1, $Brother2, and $Me, can you go help him out?\"  \n\nYou see, what $PK didn't realize was that $B1, $B2, and $Me were all studying Computer Forensics, and had all learned to retrieve a crap ton of information, and a lost Power Point presentation would be easy pickin's compared to some of our assignments. $FP explained this and, looking nervous, agreed that if we could retrieve the presentation that he'd present it. So the lot of us follow $PK to his dorm room, and he lets us take a look at his PC. Well we all ensured that we knew the right steps to recover the document. We go through all the steps, each of us making sure the steps are right (we were students, after all), and we do find an autosaved copy of the presentation.\n\n&gt;*$Me:* \"So is this the presentation? It's the newest file here.\"  \n&gt;*$PK, looking nervous:* \"Umm, yeah, it probably was that.\"  \n&gt;*$B1:* \"Great, glad we could find it. Let's open it just to make sure it's right.\"  \n\n$B2 opens the restored document\n\n&gt;*$B2:* \"There's only a title page here.\"  \n&gt;*$PK:* \"It must not be from the right time!\"  \n\n$B2 opens the document properties window.\n\n&gt;*$B2:* \"This says it was last modified and last accessed at about 5:30 pm, about half an hour before the meeting started.\"  \n&gt;*$PK:* \"Well that's not right!\"  \n&gt;*$Me:* \"That also says the document was only created at about 5pm anyway.\"  \n&gt;*$B1:* \"If you needed extra time on your presentation we could've given you an extra week. We understand schoolwork comes first.\"  \n\nBack at the meeting place, $PK explains to us and to $FP that he was going to make the presentation after all his classes, and that once he got free, he started to create the presentation and closed it once he realized he wouldn't finish in time. We explained that we understood how time can get away from someone, and how we didn't take any of this so extremely seriously that we were gonna kick him out just for a late presentation, but that lying about it was a problem, and how we need brothers to be responsible for their actions and their inaction. How, since our fraternity focuses so heavily on Community Service, we need to make sure that we aren't making flimsy excuses to not participate in service outings. He understood, and I believe a week or two later he did present. But it was agreed by all, including $PK, that this fraternity might not have been a good fit for $PK.\n\n**TL;DR** Guy lies and says he lost a project we asked for, doesn't realize that he's talking to the exact people who could verify he's lying with actual concrete proof.",

        "text": "Another tale from my time in legaltech.\n\nI had been flown out to Osaka, Japan to assist in setting up transcription for a private arbitration at a hotel. My confusion with eastern-style toilets and astonishment at carrying twenty thousand *anything* in my wallet aside (\"merely\" two 10k yen notes), I adjusted fairly quickly to the setting, settled into the heat and got to work in the hearing room as they were preparing it.\n\nOur system setup was a small linux netbook running our transcript server, connected to a Cisco router already configured for our purposes; we would chain out some network switches from the LAN ports, setting up laptops for local users, and use the local venue's internet access through the WAN port to provide the service to external authorised parties.\n\nAs usual I'd set up our core system for the transcription team and started on the networking. I looked around for a floor port but turned up nothing and gestured to the hotel manager, who will be $HM (and I'll list the other actors as they come in a similar manner).\n\n&gt; **$HM**: Yes, sir!\n\n&gt; **$ME**: (unused to such politeness) I, uh, need to get internet access to provide our service.\n\nShe goes over to a wall panel and unscrews it to reveal: their own router, plugged into the wall. I ask if it's alright to disconnect and I'm told it's fine, it's just for the wifi and there's plenty of coverage.\n\nSo I plug the cable into my router's WAN and wait for it to come up. I can't do much with the server until the internet is instated, so I'm waiting just for this.\n\nIt never does anything. I wait, I unplug, I turn it off and on again, nothing. I plug the cable back into the hotel router and connect to its wifi. Internet access is back in seconds. Oh dear. This must be a local router setting.\n\nSo I try something else. I take a cable from the hotel's router's LAN port and stick it in our WAN. Nada. Zip. I try it with a laptop.\n\nI get an IP address and have network access, but no internet. And the hotel's internal network has security, probably MAC address limitations. I gesture to $HM again.\n\n&gt; **$ME**: I need direct access to the internet but I think only your routers are allowed to use the local ethernet connections. Can I get a different line or have it reconfigured?\n\n&gt; **$HM**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter.\n\nThe English interpreter arrives post haste and I reiterate my query to her.\n\n&gt; **$EI**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter *with knowledge of technical terms*.\n\nThe technical interpreter arrives and I say, once more, my query. He nods at me and calls a number on the room phone. Four men in jumpsuits arrive and he presumably relays my question in Japanese.\n\nAfter a moment, the men all nod excitedly and smile at me.\n\nI smile back and take a seat.\n\nThe men continue to smile and stand there.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence, I realise my question has been lost in translation.\n\nThere are a few hours before the clients are due to start arriving.\n\nAfter being told the local tech support does not speak or read English, I attempt to use a flipchart and markers to relay the message using pictograms. This is also unsuccessful.\n\nRunning out of both options and time, I wonder if I can reconfigure the router for our service by connecting to it with a laptop by cable and directly accessing the gateway IP.\n\nI am confronted by completely incomprehensible Japanese characters with no way of translating them. I do know what a router login screen looks like however, so I ask the TI for the router admin details.\n\nNone of the hotel staff know, so I take a wild stab in the dark and try the default login details on the bottom of the thing (root / root) and ***what do you know***?!\n\nStumbling through menu options, I do eventually get the router configured as intended, sort out the rest of the room for networking and the job goes off without a hitch.\n\n\nI celebrated that evening by going to a local store and watching the most furious (and only) YGO tournament I've ever seen.\n\nEdit: I incorrectly remembered my 20k yen as 100k yen. *Slight* difference there.",

        "text": "Last week we were at a remote site (hotel/camping) of one of our clients that is a bit independently managed. Our main goal: Prepare their somewhat ancient Windows Small Business 2008 Server dreadnought of an IBM tower for decomissioning.\n\nThat trip was planned weeks ago. Everything was layed out:\n\n\\-rebuild their network structure to make use of a recently laid fibre and unifi (ha!) everything but separate the office network from the guest network; that site somehow forgot to mention to us for nearly a year that they contracted a local ISP/MSP to set up a guest wifi network with a pretty healthy Unifi stack + 100/40 speed, while their office happily cludged along with 2 Mbit down / 0,00 up on a piece of shit ISP provided plastic CPE router where you configure the internal LAN IP under the DHCP tab...\n\n\\-set up a site to site VPN between the main and remote site\n\n\\-dump their PSTs, upload those to the main Exchange server &amp; set up Outlook correctly for the first time; for some shit reason the client's Outlooks downloaded emails via a POP3 account &amp; put them in the .ost file of a local Exchange account (I didn't know until a month ago that this was even possible; and why would you)\n\n\\-migrate their user profiles to the new domain (shoutout to ForensIT!)\n\n\\-migrate their on-prem hotel management software to the cloud offering of the same vendor (the main reason for that particular SBS' existence)\n\n\\-migrate all shares to a local Synology &amp; set up double backups local &amp; remote\n\n\\-point the AV to the new management server\n\n\\-throw SSDs at their not-old-enough-yet desktops mainly because WE can't stand to work on anything else anymore\n\n\\-yadda yadda other small office stuff like fighting with the correct syntax for scan-to-smb on their kyocera yadda yadda\n\nEverything went mostly fine. We were done in only 12 hours for a total of 3 PCs in sweltering central European heat. All new or altered workflows were checked by the staff and got the final \"it's all so fast now!\" sign of approval. We nodded at ourselves for a job well done.\n\n\"So, we're gonna take this monster away now?\"\n\nUncertain finger tapping.\n\n\"...better not. Just shut it down and see what happens. I swear to you that some bullshit is just waiting to jump at us. Leave it connected so that the staff can just switch it on.\" The machine was wound down and the office temperature dropped by 5°C in the next 10 minutes, I swear.\n\nBullshit jumped at me today.\n\nThe assistant hotel manager wrote a somewhat panicked email, that their personel management Access database wouldn't open. (for you younglings: Access is nowadays regarded as a somewhat fancied-up Excel)\n\nWait, what? We checked that it worked after the migration. There was this single Access file on the share that we migrated to the Synology NAS and which we *saw* they used.\n\nWeeell, we checked that it worked *before* we shut down the server... Obviously we overlooked a dependency.\n\nBut how, why!? Why would that Access file not work anymore if the server would be offline?\n\nIn this case, the only reason why that Access would have problems is if the actual data is not kept by the Access file itself but by a database that the Access file would connect to.\n\nUsually you'd do this by connecting that Access (file) to a SQL server instance &amp; and subsequent database, which would be a good enough solution for something small like this. That database could be on the same machine or somehwere else on the network, say, on a server.\n\nBut we looked: There was no SQL instance on the server other than the usual SBSMonitoring instance that comes/came with every Small Business Server installation and that no one ever, in the past, present and future ever cared, cares or would care for. It's just... there. You don't touch it. You let it do it's thing because you fear the repercussions of too much meddling. It's like a Baltimore cop that is completely aware of the drug trade right in front of him, but can't act on it *all the time* because that would generate more problems, what with the complex socioeconomic intricacies of the drug trade in communities and cities.\n\nBut, see, that is the administrator/integrator talking. You never now what a *developer* might do...\n\n**Phase 1: Solution oriented approach**\n\nI told them to switch the server back on and after half an hour of presumably huffing and puffing (fingers crossed; it's a bare metal SBS that ran like 8 years straight after all and probably just threw a disk) the server posted and I could remote in. Meanwhile, the hotel manager could access the personel management thingy again and was relieved a bit.\n\n**Phase 2: Problem oriented approach**\n\nNow what was it... ah yes, there was a screenshot of an error message that the manager sent prior to all that when he tried to open the file in the first place.\n\n\"ODBC connection error: Can't connect to SBSSERVER\\\\SBSMonitoring\"\n\nOh you dick... you didn't. Wherever you are, I hope you'll get devoured by a swarm of acid cicadas.\n\n**Phase 3: Post-mortem**\n\nSo this is where it's at now: We have to track down the guy that wrote that Access file and was handed access to the server to insert his database into the SBSMonitoring instance (because why spin up a dedicated instance when you can just use what's already there, right?), so that he can do the needful to port this away from the server so that the machine can finally groan to a peaceful death.\n\nIn all propability that would be the stereotypical good-with-computers standalone-developer acquaintance of a friend's friend of the former hotel manager and is either dead, retired, disgruntled or at least two of those three. Bonus: He probably only speaks French. I don't.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nPart-time developer decided to hide a production database inside a non-related SQL instance where it was overlooked. Successful scream test.",

She blamed my mom for getting fired, (as my mom had reported some things she shouldn't have been doing, though lots of other people were reporting her as well.) \n\nSo she got on Facebook and threatened to come after my mom with a gun, and to blow up the school. My mom reported it to the police but they didn't do much.\n\nThe woman now blames the whole thing on her psychiatric medications being messed up. My mom ran into her randomly in a store a year ago and the woman apologized. Apparently she's now working for the public school department, so my mom went to them and told them about the threats, though she has no clue if they did anything about it.\n\nSo basically I never should have set up a computer for her because that's what she used to make the threats, but there was no way I could have known what would happen.

        "text": "Over the years I have become the go to person when the iSeries systems operators discover a badly written DB2 SQL that is causing system slowdowns. I get an e-mail forwarded to me that has a chain of e-mails between the user and our operators explaining why they keep killing his SQL. According to the DB2 plan cache the SQL would exceed 20+ hours. Oops. Enter me.\n\nI e-mail the user from this thread and kindly request the SQL statement. After some back and forth during which he explains to me he has a PhD in Materials Science and has taken so much more advanced math and computer programming that he doubts I'll be able to even understand what is trying to do.\n\nAs they say Challenge Accepted.\n\nHe sends me his query. He is comparing the data in two files to find where the data in the first file is not in a column in the second file. To be more specific he wants to know for a given part if it is never a child in the bill of material (BOM) file. His part file is 100 thousand parts and his part of the BOM file is 1 million parts. Since he is using a not in and the child field is not indexed the database has to look at all 1 million records each time it finds a part that is not a child. Since most parts are parent parts this means a lot of million row full table scans. I think the final result had about 10 thousand parts that were not children.\n\nSo a little SQL magic using Common Table Expressions plus reversing the logic so I can use IN instead of NOT IN and I get the query down to 20 seconds. I love DB2 SQL. (for the record I use Oracle and SQL Server as well and if forced to admit MS Access.)\n\nSo I send him this new query for him to test. \n\nNow we have a new back and forth. The query can't be right because it is... TOO FAST!\n\nFinally after much testing on his end he concedes that I am correct and tells me my SQL is mystic. :D",

        "text": "A vast majority of the time vendors will only think about the new shiny with new customers and will not really put much thought into what happens when their existing, longtime customers upgrade to the new shiny.\n\nToday I had a faculty member come in with an \"email problem\". According to him, the campus email only lets him see 8 emails at a time. When he wants to see more email, he needs to delete the top 8 so he can see the next 8. He also went on to explain that this was so because he could \"only see the right cursor, but the middle cursor does not show up\" and therefore he \"could not see all the icons\". One of my new staff was helping him and I saw that this was going to become **A Thing™**, so I stepped in.\n\nIt turns out that this fellow had gone to the Fruit, Inc. store to address some issue on his laptop. The tech support there had informed him that his operating system was too old and that he needed to update, so he let them. After his visit, all sorts of strange things started happening. First, he noticed that when he turned on his computer almost every program he had installed would start automatically. This, of course, was very inconvenient, as it meant he had to spend time closing everything before he could get to work reading his email, which of course, he could now only read 8 at a time of. This proved to be too much, so he came to us.\n\nFor those of you that have been using Fruit, Inc. computers for a while, you're aware that at some point they made the absolutely braindead decision to make it so that scrollbars would automatically disappear on computers that have touchpads by default. The thought, of course, is that if you have a touchpad you could just two finger scroll and that's so intuitive, *anyone* could figure that out. This poor instructor's issue was that because the scrollbars disappear and because nobody told him that two finger scrolling was a thing (I believe new computers show you a gestures tutorial on first run, but it's been a while since I've seen a new Fruit laptop fresh out of the box), he thought that he could no longer scroll down further. This was the \"cursor in the middle\" that was \"missing\".\n\nThe second issue is that on this particular operating system, closing all the windows of an application does not necessarily mean that the application itself has quit, it just means it has no active windows. Combined with an update that lets you start back where you left off after a shutdown, this meant that every program that he'd ever opened and had closed the window on but never actually quit was still technically running, and when he restarted his computer, the OS helpfully started back up where he \"left off\". Because he was dutifully re-closing the windows (instead of quitting, because again, he doesn't know it's a thing), the computer would helpfully do it *every*. *single*. **time**. he rebooted.\n\nTL;DR: The new shiny may may you oooh and aaahh, but for the more experienced it may also make you **ARGGGGGH!**",

I booted to a linux usb and mounted the drive and it was in read only mode as well. (He had all his files backed up but needed a couple that weren't backed up yet. I got those off first thing.)

        "text": "Hello TFTS! LTL;FTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, etc. etc. etc. This should be short.\n\nI've commented on several stories lately, and finally have one to share myself. Some background: I am now a SME (Sometimes Management-ish Entity) at an inbound technical helpdesk for a particular worldwide corporation. Said corporation has retail locations all over  wherein one exchanges money for wheeled conveyances of various sorts. In addition to said transport, you also receive a printed (triplicate) contract for your records.\n\nIt is one of those contracts (or the printer thereof) that brings me to you today.\n\nA co-worker took this call, so I don't have direct dialogue, but for one quote.\n\nThe scene is thus: user calls into the desk, with the problem that their printer is malfunctioning. Every contract they print is printing backwards. Not right to left, or bottom to top, but rather the text of the contract is printed on the BACK of the triplicate forms that get fed into the printer. Clearly a printer issue.\n\nThe user is somewhat resistant to the suggested troubleshooting: turning the forms face-down in the paper tray, and test-printing a contract to see if this resolves their issue. One bit of this resistance is that 'the issue started recently'. In fact, there was a coincidence of the problem starting with also having reloaded the printer tray with forms.\n\n\"Nay!\", I hear you think, dear reader. But \"Yea\" say I. After duly wearing down the caller's resistance, the paper was turned over, a test was printed, and behold, a contract printed on the front of the form, in the correct orientation. It is then our dear caller made this observation: \"We put the paper in upside down and it's working now. I guess we just need to load the paper in upside down to make it work.\"\n\nI have since added to my checklist for printers:\n\n1. Is it plugged in?\n2. Is it turned on?\n3. Is it REALLY plugged in?\n4. Is the paper orientation correct?\n\nEdit: words, and apparently reddit's auto-numbering doesn't believe in zero indexing.",

        "text": "So, this is my first post in a long time. This also didn't happen recently.\n\nI go to a school where they encourage technological use (apart from using phones in class and what not) and we have computer class once a week. I'm not a hardware god, but I know enough to have built my own computer. This might as well count as a r/TIFU, brace yourselves.\n\nSo, even if this isn't exactly a real tech support job, I act as the tech support in my class since we live in a rural farming area in Ireland, where people are used to outside and nature and not sitting on their asses all day using a computer. So apart from the teacher, I am the most knowledgable in the class.\n\nWell one day the teacher is absent, and lo and behold someone's computer isn't working. Our sub teacher (just another teacher who works at the school, a history teacher, who somehow knows less about history than she does computers (and she knows nothing about computers)) is supervising the class, and she goes over to the person who's computer isn't working. When she asks if anybody is good at computers, a couple of people mention me.\n\nNot wanting to tarnish my reputation as \"master of all the things technology^TM\", and being the idiot that I sometimes am, I agreed.\n\nI walked over, cracked my knuckles and looked at what was going on. Computer wouldn't turn on. \"Okay\" I thought to myself, simple enough. Should just be the cable in the back. I check the cable in the back, it's plugged in alright, and making the slight humming sound that those cables make. \"Maybe the switch?\", I ask. No, switch is turned on.\n\nThe teacher seeing I am having obvious trouble with solving the issue, tells me to stop and to go back to my seat, as I'm probably making it worse. That slightly pissed me off. \"Because, I knew the steps I needed to take to solve said issue. After all, I built my own computer. What have /these/ people done?\" /s\n\n\"Miss, I know everything about computers.\" I say confidently.\n\nI plug out the thing, cables and everything. (To the horror of my sub teacher, but after the last bold statement you'd have to have believed me.) monitor, mouse &amp; keyboard, \n /EVERYTHING/. I tear off the side panels violently, and start getting to work. Unplug motherboard cable, cpu cable fan cable and all. Replug, in reverse order to try and test which thing is broken. To nobody's surprise after seeing such comedy, it still wouldn't turn on. Worse is I technically broke it at that point, because I opened it. She told me to go sit down, and I did the walk of shame to my seat and sat quietly (strange because I have this habit of speaking very loudly, which I'm working on) \n\nSo a week passes, and the teacher has a talk with me. Turns out there was something wrong with the little coin battery in the motherboard, as well as some unplugged cable he wouldn't specify. I got off easy, but am now no longer trusted by any of the teachers when it comes to computers, which is a shame because it was going to be my next check on my list to solve the issue. But play stupid games win stupid prizes, I guess.\n\nAnd that's the tale.",

        "text": "Something very few people know about me is that when I get really stressed out I cuss hard enough that it would make a hardened sailor blush. Usually I am pretty good at keeping my temper in check but once the cat’s out of the bag I won’t stop until either a) the problem has corrected itself, or b) I run out of steam and/or languages to cuss in. For readability I have translated my four-language cussing tirade below into censored english.\n\n\nIt had been a particularly bad week at the fix-it shop, complete with rude customers, a 30-minute ‘ware scrub turning into a 6 hour marathon of quenching digital brushfires, getting one of my coworker's backlog dumped on me without warning, having my hours rearranged on the fly and one of the temps being extra sleazy towards me all week. All small things I could endure one at a time but everything happening so close together had the effect of grinding down my patience thinner than ice in the Sahara desert summer.\n\n\nThen the Printer From Hell arrived.\n\n\nIt was a Brother printer, though I can’t remember exactly what model, only that it had a option to connect via wireless. The guy who brought it in said it would connect to wireless but a few seconds afterwards it would disconnect and had to be restarted to find the network again, only to drop the connection after a few second again. The warranty had run out and he had pulled some sob story about absolutely needing the printer fixed quickly and that he couldn’t afford a new one. \n\n\nBeing young and naive I thought a printer couldn’t be that much of a problem to fix. I was sure it would be a quick fix and dug in with gusto, hooking it up to one of our loaners, downloading drivers and looking up settings. After i got connected via USB and al drivers installed i removed the USB cable and tried to connect it to the shop wireless. The connection looked fine and, naive as I was, I thought it had just been some problem with the guys drivers. Nope, there went the wireless connection down the drain. I restarted the printer and tried again.  \nConnected, stable… aaand dropped connection. \n\n\nSeveral tries, downgraded driver versions and a lot of google-fu later I was at the end of my sanity. This piece of plastic and circuits taunted me with it’s pure existence. It’s stubborn refusal to keep the connection grated on my nerves like nothing before had. \nWhy the temp guy chose this time to come up to me and be a sleazy a**hole I’ll never know. Maybe he lacked a sense of self preservation or he just didn’t care. \n\n\n&gt;”Hey beautiful, how about a deal: I fix that for you and you go on a date with me tomorrow. Wadda’ you say?”\n\n\nNo. Nope. Never ever in a million years. Like crystal glass struck juuust in the right spot my patience shattered into a million pieces and all the fury I had bottled up came spilling out with the result of something along the lines of: \n\n\n&gt;“Connect you d---l’s f---ing c---spawn piece of a--chewing s--tstain from s---ns da--ed and ruined a---hole! Connect or I shall tear open your cover and do unspeakable things to your innards you a--f---ed  \nm----rf---er!”\n\n\nAll the while smacking the offending printer with my fist over and over until my hand hurt too much to continue. When I was done and out of breath I just slumped down on my chair and sat there glaring at it for several minutes. The temp guy looked like he had had a cute flower turn into a venomous snake in his hand and had backed off several meters.   \n\nAfter I finally regained my composure I gave the printer another onceover. Power it down, unplug every cable possible, remove drivers, count to ten, reinsert the cables, power it up and reinstall drivers then connect it to the wireless and crossed my fingers. \n\n\nConnected, clear connection aaand… it stayed online. It actually stayed connected. I don’t know if it was the percussive maintenance or the complete powerdrain that fixed it but it was keeping the connection. I left in plugged in until the customer came to pick it up the next day and the printer kept its connection for that entire time. \n\n\n**TL;DR**: Cursed both a printer and a sleazy coworker into submission at the same time",

        "text": "A cautionary tale.\n\nI don't work in IT, but have used home computers for a long, long time. Coded 6502 and BASIC for a while. Even wrote some utility programs at work. At least I had the sense to realise I was only a fair amateur...\n\n( KISS, no spaghetti code, REM and renumber, user interface says 'Please', 'Thank You', 'Sorry' and 'Pass n of m'.)\n\nOur home network is hard-wired because the old house-bricks eat any signal that is not 'line of sight' to an access point.\n\nThe cable modem on this upstairs desk feeds a nice, dumb, metal-cased 8-way switch box, which feeds two PCs and an old HP all-in-one printer. Cables wander off to the rest of the house. Upstairs, there's a modern all-in-one A3 printer, a 'wide body'. Downstairs, concentrated by a couple of dumb 5-way switch boxes, there are a bunch of IP cameras, an old router/extender re-purposed as a switch+WAP, and a high-end Blu-Ray player. The latter had a wireless dongle, but the data rate was terrible. One spare cable later, it's happy.\n\nSo, middle of the evening, I'm working on my desk computers when family shout up that the Blu-Ray player has lost the network. Takes me a few minutes to confirm the correct menu options are still set, and there really is no connectivity. Takes me a little longer to notice some of the usual blinken lights on the switch+WAP don't. But the power is on.\n\nPower off, mutter, mutter, mutter, power on. Self diagnostic blinkies mostly okay. The switcher is talking to downstream stuff, but ...\n\nFine. Back at desk, I open Chrome browser, access the switcher. Well, I tried. No network access. I've Internet access, that's okay. I run the IP scanner. That says that I've lost the downstairs stuff.\n\nHas upstairs switcher glitched ? I can see the cables are all in place, but the one heading downstairs has a dark status blinky.\n\nPower off, mutter, mutter, mutter, power on. Self diagnostic blinkies mostly okay. The switcher is talking to other downstream stuff, but not the downstairs cable...\n\nThus began four hours of hapless trouble-shooting, often escorted by our four tabby cats. Three spotty, one swirly, all free-spirits. And no, none of them had chewed on a cable or peed up a switcher. Or coughed a fur-ball into something expensive. Not this time...\n\nCome 2 AM, I am slumped at desk. I've run out of things to try. The cable heading down-stairs was clipped to picture rails, ran under carpets and furniture, would take a miserable week to demount and replace. My free-lying 'proof of concept' cable had been a grade-A trip hazard. It even got me ! Never again, I'd been told.\n\nThe cats come to offer their sympathy. Up and down the desk, around and around and around.\n\nThey love watching modem and switcher blinken lights. \n\nBoss cat reaches a paw, extends a claw, tags a Cat-6's clip.\n\nOut comes the plug.\n\nNOW I understand.\n\nI run down-stairs, prepare three fresh bowls of catfood.\n\nThen I go back to my desk and carefully unplug, firmly replace EVERY network cable I can reach. Turns out several were unlatched, but one had crept just enough to disconnect. Yes, that one...\n\nBlinken lights resume. Network restored.\n\nStagger off to bed while calling myself every sort of stupid ijit...",

        "text": "This is something that will always stick with me, and I'm glad I found this sub so I can share it with y'all.\n\nIt was about 3 years ago- I got hired onto an entry desktop support position at a call center office, and my boss had me coming in for the morning shift to handle the easy morning stuff. The morning shift would only be myself, and the tasks were simple things like unlocking/resetting passwords, reimaging PCs and walking the sales floor to make sure things were greased up and running before the rest of the team came.\n\nIn the early mornings, this call center holds training classes and orientation sessions for their new hires. Now, this one particular morning, I received a call from one of the trainers, we'll call him David. I would bump into David every now and then during my floor walks, and he seemed to know what he was doing. Mind you, I was still a noob, trying to read out how the people were, how the flow of the office was, etc. \n\nSo David calls me and says that one of his agents can't log in. I do the usual, ask for the agent's username and reset their password. He insists that the agent has tried multiple times, and is still not able to log in.\n\nNow, I'm not seeing that the account is locked in AD, so I asked for the computer name so I can remote over to check. He says he doesn't know the computer name and if I could just come to the training room to help because he's busy.\n\nI figured why not since there's not much action happening at 5AM besides YouTube on my monitor. I head into the training class, and David's running around trying to help all the new folks, then glances over at me. He waves me down and leads me over to the agent.\n\nDavid - \"Yea, she's the one that can't log in, help her out please.\"\n\nMyself - \"Alright lets see, may you go ahead and try logging in...\"\n\nThe agent, early 20s, proceeds to enter her credentials. Typing in her username and password, one key after another with her index finger. I was told by my supervisor, that this office has a high attrition rate, and now I could see why.\n\nAfter the agent typed in her username on that crisp Windows 7 login screen, she lifts her right hand over to firmly hold onto the mouse, then moving it down to click on the password field. Of course, in my mind, I'm just saying press Tab, but that'd be too easy.\n\nShe goes on to type in her password, and then once again, gets a hold of the mouse and gracefully hovers that there cursor over the 'Cancel' button and clicks on it with finesse. During this moment, time seriously slowed down so much, I could hear my neck creak and my teeth grind. \n\nI didn't believe that actually just happened, I thought it was a mistake, so I had her input her credentials again. We run it back once more, and AGAIN, she hovers over 'Cancel.' I had to cut in and say, 'No no no no....click on the arrow.' All of this, and no password reset nor an account unlock was needed.\n\nI glanced over at David, and he didn't care at what had just happened. He only said, \"Awesome, she's logged in, great!\" and moved on. I learned a lot from that day, and that office. I also learned very much that there were more trainers like David. All in all, lots of tales, but that one tops it for me at that office.\n\nThanks for reading. ",

        "text": "TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nAlthough I'm an IT Consultant, this didn't happen on the clock at work since I was on vacation at the time, but still a good one nonetheless.\n\nAnyways, some good friends came down to visit from out-of-state and we get an Airbnb private place with a couple -of bedrooms and a living area with a big TV. One day after coming back from the beach we decide to watch a movie that my friend has downloaded onto his laptop. He takes the the HDMI cable that's running from the TV and plugs it into his laptop to get the display on the TV but nothing happens.\n\n**Friend:** \"It's not coming up.\" (*Messes with a few settings. Unplugs and re-plugs the cord in.*)\n\n**Me:** (*IT mode kicks in*). \"Try Windows + P and select duplicate.\" (*I'm walking over to make sure he's doing it right.*)\n\n**Friend:** \"Nope not working either.\"\n\n(*I'm looking to make sure the TV's on and that its set to the correct HDMI.*)\n\n**Me:** \"Go into the display settings on your laptop and see if it even detects the TV.\" (*Nothing shows in there either.*)\n\nAs all of this is happening, I notice his computer is unusually slow for a decent gaming laptop. Takes a few moments for a simple display settings screen to come up. I think to myself that the next quickest step would be to do a reboot.\n\n**Me:**  \"You know what? Go ahead and reboot your computer.\"\n\n(*Friend gets unusually annoyed at this request.*)\n\n**Friend:** \"What?! No Dude.. Only bad IT tells people to restart the computer. There is some reason this is not working!\"\n\n(*He proceeds to ramble on how at his job, the 'bad' IT people will always tell people to reboot.*)\n\n**Me:** (*Now insulted*) \"Actually, good IT will know when its appropriate to reboot and now is the time\".\n\n(*He reluctantly agrees to do it but still annoyed about doing it*.)\n\n**Me:** (*Still insulted*) \"There is a reason 'turning it off, turning it on' is a thing, and its because it fixes a lot of weird issues!\"\n\nWe notice during the reboot that Windows is doing long updates which is a hint that he is not shutting down enough. According to him, he mostly just keeps his laptop asleep and closed when not using it. I may have a small thread of doubt that there is a 5% chance it still wont work and its like a bad display card or the TV HDMI port is busted but I'm confident the reboot will do the trick.\n\n**Me:** \"When was the last time you shut this thing down?\"\n\n**Friend**: \"Maybe once every few weeks.\" *(I'm thinking to myself. No wonder his sh\\*\\* ain't working.*)\n\nAfter finishing its updates the moment of truth arrives and unsurprisingly, to me at least, the TV immediately gets the display on it right at the log in screen.\n\n**Friend:** (*Looking somewhat defeated.)* \"Ugh! Why does that fix it? It makes no sense!\"\n\n(Keep in mind at work I don't get to be this blunt with users and I have to do everything with a grin on my face no matter how stupid it is so now I begin to teach a hard lesson. Also keep in mind that this particular friend loves to boast about his skills at his job nonstop and all the stuff he does so I get a little 'teachy' with him here.)\n\n**Me:** (*This may not be exactly verbatim*) \"Because keeping it on long enough will cause system background stuff to gradually jump ship and stop working. Typically a reboot is the quickest and easiest way to get the operating system back to normal function. You need to shut it down at least once in a while. Also... only egotistical IT will 'try' and fix an issue like this by wasting everyone's time and screwing with the settings for hours on end instead of trying a reboot.\"\n\n(*I said all of this with a stern glare and stern voice but it felt good.*)\n\nWe proceed to watch the movie with no hard feelings. It felt good to show a little of my 'expertise' considering this particular friend talks non-stop about all the stuff he does at work and how good he is at his job and always talking about the programs he creates. I was incredibly insulted when someone who likes to boast about their career and skills insults mine so I pretty much threw the book at him during this whole fiasco.\n\n**TL:DR** \\- Friend plugs laptop into TV. No display comes up. Tell him to reboot. He gets mad and tells me only bad IT people recommend that. I get insulted. He reboots, and screen comes up on the TV. He sheepishly listens to me while I teach him a lesson about how IT is more about finding the best and quickest solution for the issue rather than assuming it can be done in some longer time consuming manner. We both move on, forget about the fiasco, and continue being friends.",

        "text": "We finally moved all of our email services to Exchange/Office 365. The final migration was this past weekend, which means service accounts can be their own Exchange accounts now that are added separately to email clients (most service accounts are permission-based by a list of users, and will automatically show up as a second inbox without any extra steps; some were created as a secondary account based on the need).\n\nMy manager stopped by my desk this morning and asked me to call someone in the President's Office, let's call her AA for Administrative Assistant. I was a bit a confused because I was already working on a different ticket for AA, even if it was for a different computer this person sometimes mentions multiple issues while she's on the phone with you. I call AA and ask to remote in to see what's happening. As she's explaining what's happening, she also sends me the error message she got.\n\n&gt;$AA: I was trying to send this email to our Board of Trustees and it failed, but when I sent a test to my Gmail, it went through fine.\n\nI looked at the error message, looked at what she was doing, and almost immediately figured it out. She had her email, Old Secretary (OS) which went through our pop server and New Secretary (NS), which went through Exchange. It was trying to send through the OS and she didn't change the \"From\" option. I couldn't just remove the OS account because there was some mail saved locally in that account that needed to be moved to Exchange, so I named it appropriately, so that she knew which inbox was old and new, but this didn't reflect on the \"From\" field in a new email. Even when I showed her how to distinguish between them (the old one had her name on it, the new one had Secretary), she said she understood but didn't seem to.\n\nI asked her to try sending the email again, and either it would go through with no problem and they'd receive it, or it wouldn't again and they wouldn't know an email was being sent. She said she'd test it again and call me back. Once she called me back, she did the same thing with trying to send from the old account. I had to show her again how to change it, then I figured out it was defaulting to that because she was in the OS folder. I explained this to her and recommended being in the email she intended to send from, when sending a new email. I think she understood this time.\n\nWe all know that users lie, but is there a rule for users that don's listen even when you show them the issue?",

        "text": "Not sure if providing tech support to myself qualifies, but I think it should? \n\nI work in financial planning, but one of my roles these days is creating various technical tools that my team uses to create financial plans. A couple days ago, I was working on one of these tools - basically, it's an Excel sheet designed to take a cashflow table as input, and clean it up into a format we prefer(change a few names, delete empty rows, sum up the totals, etc.). I've been using an English-language version of this for months with no issues, but my team covers all of Canada, so now we need a French-language version as well. \n\nI translated the text, and expected to see the same nicely-formatted output we get in English and...it's trash. Half the rows are deleted, nothing is formatted right, and it's a mess. So, time to figure out what's going on. I look at the formulas, and most of them seem to be working fine, but there's a couple oddities. All the text formatting is right, but anything based on numbers(e.g., \"are any of these greater than zero?\") is failing. \n\nQuebec uses number styles differ from English-speaking Canada. We would write a thousand as \"1,000\", while they write it as \"1 000\". Simple enough for most purposes, but these numbers are being put into an Excel sheet, and that means Excel needs to treat them as numbers. And it seems that to Excel, \"1 000\" is a text string - it can use commas to separate digit groups, but not spaces. \n\nOkay, let's fix that. A bit of text substitution to clean out the spaces, and it's coming through as \"1000\" - that should be a number, right? Weirdly enough, no, it's not - IF(1000&gt;0) is still coming out false. So I try another text-cleaning approach, and then I check it by adding something to the result. I figure that if addition works, it's a number, right? \n\nSure enough, addition works fine. 1000+1 = 1001, so we're good. Except that, when I look at the final output, we're not good. Something is clearly wrong, and when I dig through it turns out to be a \"find the largest of these\" function - the largest one of a group of five positive numbers is zero. However, the one that I tested by adding one to it, that one(and *only* that one) works fine. It seems that a string of digits from a text function isn't *really* a number in Excel's mind, but the result of an addition is. \n\nI ponder this for a minute, and then realize what I need to do. In the cells where I'm doing the text cleaning, I go in and add \"+0\" to all of the cells I'm doing the text cleaning in. And sure enough, everything is a number now, and it all works perfectly. \n\nSometimes the fix is even stupider than the problem. ",

That subtle invisible field around some people that causes misbehaving tech to straighten up and look smart just by being near whatever it is that is giving you grief. This isn’t really a story about tech aura, but something on a similar wavelength.\n\n\nAnother day at the local fix-it shop, tackling anything from simple ‘ware clean-ups to complete overhauls. We did mostly computer stuff but sometimes we took on special cases. This is about one of those special cases. \n\n\nSome guy had dropped off a two, maybe three, year old 50gb mp3 player/portable drive combination that was dead as a doorknob. Again I was the only one not elbow deep in hardware guts so I got the dubious honor of poking and prodding it to see if we could scare it back to life or at least recover the data from it.   \nWell after much serious poking and some hard prodding I was ready to chuck it in the bin and call it a day. Nothing I could think of would make it turn on or even show any hint of charging. All that was left was a complete dismantle and inspection of every minute part, which would take up far more time than I was willing to give up that day. \n\n\nThen a thought struck me. When all else fails we IT folks tend to joke around about sacrifices and dark IT gods. Guess it couldn’t hurt to give it a try before I condemned the thing to the bin of lost hopes, bad dreams and unsalvageable tech. \n\n\nIt was the work of moments to swipe a blank A4 from the printer, draw a decent pentagram on it and put the offending mp3 player in the middle. I grabbed the “killer cord”, a straight 120v-to-modular-charger one of the guy had made as a joke, folded my hands into the sign of the cog, recited some stuff about the glorious machine spirit (yay for being a Warhammer 40.000 nerd!) and plugged in the killer cord. \n\n\n**SNAP**  \n\n\n**CRACKLE**  \n\n\n**HISS**  \n\n\nI yanked out the killer cord before it could start a fire and was about to toss the mp3 player when I figured I’d try to turn it on a final time. One press on the ON button and I almost dropped it out of shock when the device booted up with a jaunty start-up jingle. It worked.   Somehow it worked.   \nOne of the guys that had walked by my station and stopped to look at what I was doing was staring at me like I had resurrected a dead hamster in front of him. And that's why I got the nickname Tech Witch.\n\n\nTL;DR: When it doubt, make a sacrifice and add More Magic.",

I got a chat from a woman who was complaining about poor service on her phone, but was also chatting FROM that phone, so I couldn't actually do any troubleshooting with her, because most of it involves turning off the phone and/or other things that would end the chat. I eventually convinced her to go to her computer and chat back in, but not before this happened. Also, I cleaned this up heavily, as her actual messages to me were in texting shorthand and about 25% emoji.\n\nWoman: So I'm getting bad service when I'm traveling, but also when I'm at home as well. I'm only getting about 1 to 2 bars. But I guess that can't be helped, because of the death.\n\nMe: I'm sorry for your loss, but could you please clarify?\n\nWoman: Oh, it's not my loss. It was in the 40's. Actually, it's a really old building, so I'm sure lots of people have died here.\n\nI'm so glad this was chat so she couldn't hear me laughing my ass off at this point.

It's free and my use of it is purely for effect this morning.\n\n\nA user appears in the corner of my eye.\n\n\n\"Oh IT!\" he says. I do have an actual name but I don't think he has bothered to learn it yet. \"The printer out the back is not working.\"\n\n\nAh the old \"not working\" fault description. My absolute favourite. Never mind the ticketing system I've shown him how to use and asked him to log tickets with multiple times. Bailing me up on my break or in the hallways is much easier to do I guess.\n\n\"Sure I'll take a look at it after my coffee.\" I manage to say through gritted teeth, ignoring my top two pet hates. No real description, no ticket. Not calling me by my name was the icing on the cake. I've already internally decided not to ask any more details on the problem. I'm off the clock and I'm yet to ingest any caffeine at this point.\n\nHoping that this interaction is over, my attention is turned back to the coffee machine.\n\n\n\"Wireless\"\n\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I stutter confused and caffineless.\n\n\"Wireless.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm not following...\" I trail off, brow furrowed in bewilderment.\n\n\"Do you think it could be the wireless?\"comes the response \n\n\"For fuck sake... I don't fucking know! You just literally told me about the issue. The printer is on the other side of the  factory. I can't fucking diagnose  the issue from here. Not withstanding you told me nothing about the actual problem itself. How about some symptoms? Be more descriptive man! Besides, can you see I'm on my break. Please kindly fuck off and leave me to my 15 minutes of peace\"\n\n...is what flashed through my mind in a second.\n\nWhat I actually said was, \"I'm not sure. I'll have to check it out.\"\n\nHe left unaware of the storm boiling in my brain and the lack of caffeine in my blood.\n\nAs a post script to the story, the coffee was weak and watery and upon inspection the printer was working fine.\n",

        "text": "I work for a large phone manufacturer and a while ago I spoke to a lady who was trying to transfer data from a very old phone to a very new one. Doing this involves transferring data from the old phone to a computer program that will then connect to another program that can download it into the new phone, which isn't as complicated as it sounds if you follow the instructions we can provide you with.\n\nThis woman has however been struggling with it for quite a while and has called us several times before. It becomes obvious why only a few minutes into the call when it turns out that she asks unrelated “why”-questions about everything, doesn't really listen when you answer her questions and wants to read everything that she sees on the screen out loud to you. If you interrupt her she'll tell you to \"please let her finish\" and starts over. So, as you can imagine this becomes a rather long winded call, but after struggling for a little while we manage to transfer her data to the first program without any major incidents.\n\nBy then I've asked her perhaps two or three times if she's installed both programs and has both cables close at hand since her phones use different cables, which she says she has. She goes to plug the new phone into her computer.\n\n&gt;C: “It’s broken! The cable doesn’t fit anymore.”\n\n&gt;Me: “Are you using the cable you received with the new phone?”\n\n&gt;C: “No, why do I have to do that?”\n\n&gt;Me: “As I said earlier you have to use the cable you received with the new phone because the old one doesn’t fit.”\n\n&gt;C: “I've plugged it into the computer now and nothing has changed.”\n\n&gt;Me: “OK, so the program looks exactly the same as it did before you plugged it in? Is there a notification on your phone?”\n\n&gt;C: “No, it only says…”\n\nShe starts reading the program’s generic welcome text, which pretty much only tells you how to use it and what it can do, out loud to me. After she’s finished we do quite a bit of trouble shooting, which includes restarting everything, checking the cable and connections and asking the customer to reinstall the computer program, but despite everything it’s still stuck on the same screen. So nothing has changed, and the customer is getting a bit upset. We're about 30-40 minutes into the call by then, and about 20 minutes into my lunch break.\n\n&gt;C: “I’ve done everything now, why can’t you just fix this? I never had this issue with my [phone from other brand]! If you can't solve this within the next ten minutes I'll just throw away this phone and never by anything from you again.”\n\n&gt;Me: “I’m sorry that it’s taking a bit longer than expected to fix this issue, but I am trying to solve it as soon as possible. Just to check, are you entirely sure that you can’t see anything else in the program that wasn’t there earlier?”\n\n&gt;C: \"Well, it says \"Download for PC\" here, but that's really not important right now!\"",

LTR;FTP\n\nI work at a med-sized organization as a web dude, so technically not IT, but am required to help if I can, if not, then ask other IT members and ask for help. We use a Content Management System (CMS) where staff can write their own content for users, this way the web people aren't having to write everything and can focus on development.\n\n$M-Me\n$L- Lady\n$I - $L's intern\n\n$M working alone because others come in later. $I knocks on the door and says she needs permissions to access the CMS, I tell her to email us so someone else on the team can take care of it. I'm still relatively new so can't do everything yet. She says OK and promptly sends an email. Good. I go back to work.\n\nA few mins later, $L comes and starts talking about not being able to change something on the website, and $I is standing behind her. I look over to $I and ask \"is this related to the thing you just came here for a few minutes ago?\" $I replies \"no we can't change a link for some reason, it won't change in the website\". I get worried because this shouldn't be happening. All the systems are working fine and if there is a problem with trying to change links, it could be a big thing that requires contacting the people who've been here for much longer. Nobody here is bad with computers, plus $I is a student worker, so she should know about basics at least. This could be bad.\n\nI lock my computer and walk over to $L's room with them, and they've got the CMS open in editing mode on one monitor, and the website open on the other where they're trying to make edits and change a link. $L shows me the problem where the link in the CMS is changed to a different link, but when you click it on the website, it still redirects to the old link. I hover over the link in the CMS and it seems to be linked properly, so nothing should be wrong. There shouldn't be an issue here, everything is working fine. It's a relatively simple CMS to use, and pretty straight forward. I decide to reset and redo the whole process and see if that helps. So refresh the CMS, copy the link, link it to some text, press save, and refresh the website. When I click on the link, it redirects to what they wanted!\n\n$I screams, literally screams, \"HOW??? WE JUST DID THE EXACT SAME THING!!!!\". $L thinks and says \"you know, the only thing we didn't do that he did was press save\". $I with her high pitched voice replies something like \"no wayyyy\". I say something like \"haha yeah happens sometimes, I've probably done this as well\" and leave feeling relieved.\n\nMoral of the story, don't panic, the system is probably not dying. User's just need to be reminded of the save button.",

        "text": "Hello fellow system supporters, tech teams, and printer punchers!   \nI have a few short printer tales because The Cutover Part 3 is still a work in progress. \n\n  \n**The one where a camera company made printers.**  \nIt's not Canon, but another one that was popular in the 35mm film era. \n\nTo start, the service tech does not believe in DHCP, says it's too unreliable.  \nSo this company buys 20 of them anyways, tech pulled an IP and then set the printers to hold that IP static, the PC team didn't know the glaring problem with the method used until it was too late. We like to make note about printers if people will tell us about them. \n\nIT comes along later and re-maps the IP schema for various reasons (new hardware, getting rid of outdated technology/servers/etc.) It happens, deal with the fallout of not following protocol. \n\nThe screams of offline printers may still haunt the dreams of those poor technicians...\n\nThe only way to resolve it?  \nRenew lease on printerOS?  \nHa!  \nYou had to shut down the printer, power down the subsystem, and then flip the main switch to drain all residual charge.  \nThen and only then would it refresh it's IP address.  \n\n\n**The one that took 30 minutes to install-**\n\nHP's Laserjet 400 pro series is by far one of the most annoying designs ever as it like to switch to Russian, it's heavy, and the driver installer is weird. I followed protocol, tried the simple driver first, it failed and made the mistake of using the full-installer. \n\nThe installer did nothing for 30 minutes, but managed to load the print driver in less than 10 seconds! \n\nI cancelled the install hoping it would just stop at that point and let me load the proper HP software after the Sysadmins re-packaged HP's crap. \n\nNope! Rookie mistake!  \nDriver terminated  \n\\*Windows Chime\\*\n\nNew device detected - Discovering drivers now.  \n\\*Standard Windows Error\\*  \nTell me what it is! I know nothing!\n\nI sigh and resign to watching the screen for 30 more minutes.  \nIt finally worked, but it took so long to do so much nothing.   \n\n\n**The Russian printer:**  \nIn a new office suite, there are two identical printers located in adjacent offices and one of them decided to switch to Russian, we're not sure why or how, but it was odd. Even though I have a fantastic on-demand Russian accent for being an American, it was not enough to read or understand Cyrillic.\n\nI tried the konami code on it by stepping through the second printer's English menu to change the language.\n\nNo dice, something wasn't quite right with the order in the menu. \n\nAha! Try Google Translate! \n\nThat was really hard because of the constant up/down at the desk/matching my English keyboard to the Russian characters.\n\nI finally reach enlightenment and remember now Google has a camera translator! After some very oddly spelled words, I got close enough to find the proper language menu and set it english. \n\nDay saved, user happy.​ ",

        "text": "While in Germany, as I’ve mentioned on occasion, I found myself in charge of the POL (Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants—aka, Hazardous Materials) program and cabinets for my Company as well as the Tool Room.  Between the two jobs as well as any engine work that came up, I was rather busy and was in dire need of an assistant.  Towards the last eight months or so of my time there, we had a new Private First Class (PFC) show up and he was given to me by the Platoon Sergeant to answer my prayers.  \n\nUnfortunately, PFC Delmonte (Like the fruit brand…reminds me of his name) just added to my workload instead of lightening it.\n\nPFC Delmonte was a Power Train (transmission) mechanic from Puerto Rico by way of New York City and really didn’t care for the Army.  This was his first post-training assignment, but he’d already figured out how to game the system.  When he arrived he put on a show of not being able to understand much English (How on earth did you enlist, then?!) and therefore, was required to be accommodated with ESL (English as a Second Language) classes.  After work in the barracks?  Could hang out and BS with us all day.  Get him in the shop?  No hablo ingles.\n\nI learned quickly he seldom cared about much to do with work and was mostly disengaged.  I was able to prove this theory once while we were painting a grill my squadleader, KG, had built from aircraft stands, a wall locker and a 55 galllon drum.  The plan had been to paint the whole thing black using some spray paint I had in excess, and seeing how I had too much to do that I didn’t want to putz around with this all day, I grabbed Delmonte and had him help me out. \n\nWatching him handle the spraycan, something piqued my familiarity.  Having grown up in some unsavory areas, I realized he wasn’t actually spraying the grill—he was *tagging* it.  Smiling evily, I waited as he became engrossed in what he was doing before suddenly shouting.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Oh, %$&amp;@, it’s the cops!”\n\nHe threw that can one direction and started sprinting away across the airfield in the opposite direction.  \n\n***\nNeedless to say, I realized from his behavior that he wasn’t always the sharpest tool in addition to his lack of care for his duties.  The best place for him would be checking in and out tools from the tool room.   He wouldn’t get into too much trouble in there, and would “expose him to more English.”\n\nAround this time, in order to combat people using inappropriate secondary containment for solvents (and provide tighter inventory control in general) I had implemented a check-out policy from the POL lockers. Mechanics would have to go to the tool room to check out spray bottles of the various solvents.  It would be the responsibility of the person running the tool room to check those items out as well, since the lockers were right next to the tool room.  \n\nOne afternoon, while I was working on an engine swap on one of our Blackhawks, there was a commotion down by the ‘hell hole’ in the tail boom.  A mechanic was sliding out of the underside access panel, obviously dizzy and disoriented, holding onto a bottle of solvent.  I climbed down to help him and determine what chemical he’d just obviously been unintentionally huffing—you see, the “hell hole”  is a very tight space right where the tail boom of the helicopter joins with the main body of the fuselage.  The ventilation in there is poor, so one needs to exercise caution in any solvents they might be using since the wrong stuff could create a very dangerous atmosphere in short order.  \n\nI looked at the bottle and did a doubletake.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Snuffy, just what the hell were you doing spraying this in there?!”\n\n&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “I was trying to clean it up…”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “You’re supposed to use Isopropyl for that!”\n\n&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “I did!”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “No, this is Trichloroethylene!  You’re lucky you didn’t pass out and die in there!”\n\n&gt;**PFC Snuffy** “Well that’s what Delmonte gave me…”\n\nMy head whipped over to the tool room, where I saw him casually not caring about what was transpiring mere feet away.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Delmonte.  WTF.  He asked for Isopropyl, and you gave him trike?!”\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n&gt;**Delmonte** “So?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Snuffy could have *died*. Did you even look at the bottle?”  \n\n&gt;**Delmonte** “No.”\n \n\nHe didn’t look like he cared too much.  After that, I took away his POL locker key and made everyone come to me, instead.  He got a little piece of paper telling him to be careful, but due to his ‘language barrier’ they couldn’t actually punish him for negligence.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Soldier in Germany attempted to gas another.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoy these?

        "text": "Before we begin, allow me to introduce the players in this round:  \n\n\nBand: There was a time that Quantum was a professor at a local community college. Band was one of his better students, which helped to get him into $themed. Band was a clever guy, started as an intern a little after I did. Wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, able to keep up the pace with more complicated tasks, all around good guy. In the interim between the time I left $themed from being an intern to finishing my Bachelor’s degree and coming back, Band had become a real boy, as some other tech had left and he’d moved into their position, and if I recall correctly, he’d actually gotten a promotion to an analyst at the point this story takes place. If not, he was the highest level of technician that $themed had to offer.  \n\n\nBuchji: Buchji was the IT guy for the Pharmacy. Started as a pharmacy tech (actually dealing with drugs and such) long before I got my first taste of technology. He eventually fell into the IT role for the pharmacy and through a long and complicated tunnel he dug his way through to the IT side of the house as opposed to the Pharmacy side of the house. Being the pharmacy tech, he had his own office with all kinds of stuff that normal techs didn’t have access to for various reasons. I first met Buchji when I was an intern and thought he was just an angry older dude. What I could have never told you is that he and I would become the absolute best friends, literally doing magic and successfully doing the impossible. He and I became the dream team, if someone else couldn’t figure it out, they fielded it to Buchji and me, and we would figure it out. There was literally no problem that we were given that we didn’t at one point or another find a proper resolution to. At this point in the overarching story though, we’d worked together a lot and were very good friends, but we hadn’t figured out the capabilities we had when we worked together just yet.  \n\n\nTurtle: Turtle was my direct boss. He and my father had been friends for years, and by extension he knew me. He and $Heart (his boss) worked with my dad for years and helped me get my foot in the door. Turtle loved to give us hell about all kinds of things, but would always come through in a pinch or when you needed him. 10/10 fantastic boss, would work for again.  \n\n\nTinker: Tinker was a higher level technician, on the same level as Band. He’s known for being super good at tinkering. He was incredible with electronics and soldering and fixing broken… pretty much anything. He was also very good at hardware (computer and otherwise) modification. He’s also \\*the\\* guy that $CEO calls when anything is wrong with anything technological she has.  \n\n\nWykydtron: The AVP of Information Technology at $themed.  \n\n\n$CEO: The CEO of $themed.&lt;/p&gt;  \n\n\n\\*It is also important to note if you’ve not worked in a Hospital/environment before, there are software suites all over the place that depend on ancient software to run properly. Some of them still exist because the Hospital doesn’t want to buy something else if the old system works (even if it is the worst kind of security vulnerability), or the vendor is no longer in business or supporting the software in question, and no one could find something that works better.\\*  \n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nOur story begins on day like any other, I had just walked in the office for the morning and was browsing through ticket queue and finishing a rebuild for a user whose hard drive had died. I’m tired, its 7AM, and I hadn’t gotten my morning can of $energydrink (green/original, for those wondering). I skim through the ticket que and determine that nothing major is going on at the moment, and head to go grab a can of $energydrink and breakfast from the on campus café.  \n\n\nOn my way, I knock on Buchji’s office door and check in on him for the morning, as he was on the way, and offered to get him breakfast if he was interested. He politely obliged and we headed off. We made it to the café and got our breakfast/$energydrink and proceeded back to my office. Not a minute after we’d sat down (it’s around 8:30AM at this point), Turtle walks in and is literally freaking out about a call he’d just gotten from Wykydtron that $CEO doesn’t have office on her computer anymore, but it wasn’t just her, it was all of $Administration. Turtle proceeds to dispatch Tinker to go check on $Administration and $CEO and figure out what is going on.  \n\n\nIt was about that time I turned back to my breakfast/ticket que and I realize that the flood gates have opened. It wasn’t just $Administration that had been hit by whatever it was that took out office, it was the entire environment. I quickly proceeded to scarf down my breakfast and I believe it was the fastest I’d ever chugged $energydrink, but I knew it was going to be an incredibly long day and the sooner I got started, the better off I was going to be.  \n\n\nNot having been informed on exactly what happened, I start to ask questions. As a group we often talked about the goings on and changes that were going to be made to the environment, as my team was the one that the desktop images/updates/patches/changes lived with. Band was actually the guy using $softwaresuite to allow us to mass deploy updates and patches and deal with asset management. It was planned that there was a clearly defined list of 80 devices on 4 floors of $themed that were going to have $OldOfficesuites forcibly removed and have $OnlineOfficesuite pushed to them without technician intervention. The initial tests in our office had gone off without a hitch and Band was prepared to test on a larger group of users, but not something so big that, if it went wrong, the team would suffer brutally. We, as a collective, tried to automate everything we could automate to make life a little easier for the techs. Quantum and The Sailor had already moved on from $themed to their next big jobs at $Fortune100. Between Chewy, Band, Honey Badger, Macguy and $me, there was plenty of custom software to go around. Those guys, as well as the rest of the crew will come in other stories though.  \n\n\nWhat was intended and what actually happened were quite different though, if you haven’t caught on just yet. What actually happened was that $softwaresuite lost the file that clearly defined the 80 devices that were supposed to be our test environment, and as opposed to just stopping and asking questions like a good software should, it fired off to every device in the environment, and there was nothing we could do to stop it by the time we realized it. All we could do at that point is man our machines and try to reinstall everything we could as quickly as we could.  \n\n\nIt was impossible to get through all of the tickets (as there are 10,000 devices and 15 of us techs, only 11 of which were allocated to deal with tickets) that came in that day, but we did as well as we could. The next morning we came in, we found that a huge portion of those tickets we’d closed the day before were reopened. After further investigation, we found that $softwaresuite was still pushing the delete/uninstall command and had been all night.  \n\n\nAwesome.  \n\n\nWe dug in and found the way to stop the delete scripts from being pushed out to more devices, but the damage had been done, and we actually ended up spending almost 2 months to get $OnlineOfficesuite redeployed by hand. And while you’re wondering why we didn’t just use $softwaresuite to push out $OnlineOfficesuite, we tried that but ran into catastrophic failure on devices that had the original scripts pushed to them.  \n\n\nWe finally did get everything back to where it was intended, it was just not exactly how we intended to happen the way that it did. It was that incident though that made us shape up our Incident Response plans and make sure we were well prepared and had a plan of attack for if anything like th… \\*snickers\\* who am I kidding? Management didn’t learn any lessons from that incident, and it was actually just in the last couple of weeks that $themed got hit by an \\*actual\\* cyber-attack. From what I could tell, resolution tactics were the same and took an extended period of time with all of the techs available to issue proper resolution to that issue.  \n\n\nTl;Dr: Had a software suite powerful enough to push changes to save techs a lot of time upgrading to a new suite of products. Had a clearly defined parameter of “wild” machines to test on. Parameters lost, software suite shits bed, techs end up spending 2 months doing the job that should have been paced for around 6 months as emergency countermeasures. Management learns nothing.  \n\n\nAs a last note, during that two months there was a lot of day drinking ($soonMhine, for those curious) and a lot of frustration, but also a lot of pizza from $bestlocalpizzajoint, because morale was super low. We got through it and Band kept his job, and is actually still working for $themed. He hasn’t caused an incident like that since.  \n\n\nEdit: If you missed my last tale about Quantum and the Sailor, you can read through that [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/925isw/quantum_sailor_and_the_case_of_dumb_luck/)  \n",

        "text": "**Looking for a complete list of $404Comp tales? Here's the [index!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Savacli/wiki/tales)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**It's been a while...**  \nSorry for the long gap since my last post! Got married, honeymoon'd, and shortly after my wife and I were putting together the next sizable chapter of my DnD campaign that we finally got to play this past Saturday!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Cast**  \n**$LawnGnome:** Contrary to his name he's actually quite tall and lengthy.  \n**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$LawnGnome has been with us a couple months now and is eager to take on larger scale projects so we've been throwing him more regularly into disaster-level situations with plenty of folks on standby for support in case he gets walled. This particular support case was \"mission-critical\" level so naturally we ~~threw him into the fire~~ assigned the ticket to him.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Ugh, I can't keep up with this anymore.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Hmm?  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Oh, sorry. It's just that the database over at $HearingAgency has gone offline for the third time this week. Staff over there gets an error immediately after they try to open it.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Umm, that's not good.  What caused it?  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Don't know. It's been working fine, but all of a sudden it just refuses to open this week. The error is about having to repair the database.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** *eye twitch* Let me take a look...  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, $HearingAgency used to be pretty quiet when we first took them on as a client, but they recently had one of their admin folks retire. Why is this relevant? Well, it turns out that said admin person had took it upon herself to compact the database on a weekly basis while she worked for the Agency as a form of maintenance. So after months of her being gone from the company, the size of the database had grown to 2GB? Not too shaby for a database, eh? Well, of course I wouldn't be typing up this Tale if that was the case.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** ...this...this isn't a database; it's an abomination!!!  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** What??  \n&gt;**$Savy:** The whole thing is built on Microsoft Access!  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** What do we do?!  \n&gt;**$Savy:** We're gonna need some candles and possibly an intern to sacrifice to the IT gods.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** ....for real?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** What? No, but just we need to call their director and let her know what's going on.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*[insert montage of everyone running around and screaming]*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo add to the complexity of the situation, the \"database\" had multiple versions of itself on the shared drive, and no one knew which was the original database. Further the issue with custom FrontEnds being developed for each individual staff member that was pointing them to all different copies of the database. How do we go about fixing this?  \n\n* 1. Cry  \n* 2. Salvage the database  \n* 3. Identify the master copy and obliterate the impostors  \n* 4. Do the same for all the FrontEnd databases  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe managed to barely squeeze some life out of the database by compacting it from its hard cap of 2.00GB to a walloping 1.96GB which was enough to open the database again. We normalized everyone's FrontEnd shortcuts so that everyone would point and work out of the same copy of the database. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**So...No Interns were harmed in the making of this Tale?**  \nAfter a thumbs up check we reported back to the Director and let her know that the database is stable but is no longer something we could support and that the database would fail again if no action was taken. She was happy that we brought this issue to her attention and assured us that she had contacted a developer to migrate the database to a more suitable platform. The kicker? That very same director ended up retiring a month after she made that promise to us.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL:DR:** Someone had the brilliant idea to turn Access into their org's mission-critical database and let it reach the 2GB hard cap. Hilarity and Panic ensues.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Spelling, round 1  \nEdit 2: Typo",

        "text": "Alt account due to colleagues i’d rather not have know of this recognising my main account\n\n\nThis tale takes place back in ’09 when i was but a pimple-faced young girl fresh out of uni, with a head full of big ideas and booklearning but shy of any kind of hands-on experience.\n\nI had taken up work as a part-time IT fixer at a local fix-it shop straight out of uni. The hours were bad and the culture was severely leaning towards the “sleazy old pervert” side of the spectrum but it paid rent at least. To be fair I did dress somewhat provocative, as I like having a touch of femininity in such a male dominated area. Besides, I had gone through a bad breakup a few months before and some primal part of me enjoyed the attention I got from my male colleagues. But I digress, so on with the story. \n\nI was enjoying a quiet Friday afternoon, lazily browsing some goth clothing webstore or another when my boss poked his head in and told me he had a customer in need of on-site support ASAP and since everyone else was either busy with other things or on vacation it was my lucky day. He tossed me a crumpled piece of paper with an adress on it and the words “Server broke computer FIX ASAP” on it. \n\n\nA server that broke a computer? I had heard about the reverse happening with bad setups but this was something new for me. I decided to go all in on this to show my boss I actually knew my way around IT so I grabbed a toolbox and rammed everything i could think of needing in it. Recovery discs, ‘ware killer USBs, extra cables, screwdrivers, pliers, anything that could be remotely useful in bringing a downed computer back to life went into the toolbox. Once I had packed everything but the kitchen sink I got in my car and headed out to the adress on the paper.\n\n\nThe adress ended up being a strip club in the bad part of town. Not really what I had envisioned when I headed out but a customer is a customer, right? The bouncer let me in through the back door and I began my search for the downed computer. A quick chat with the bartender and he showed me a small office in the back. On the desk stood a Dell that looked like it had been dunked in a swimmingpool, complete with a small puddle spreading out on the desk around it and a big wet spot on the floor. When I asked the bartender what happened and how a faulty server could cause a minor flooding he nearly bent over double with laughter. It wasn’t a case of a IT server choking and dragging a computer down with it, but a case of one of the serving girls watering a potted plant near on the desk and fumbled the pitcher of water all over the computer on the floor next to the desk. \n\n\nWell, the poor computer was busted alright. Nothing I could do to save it but bring it back to the shop and fetch a loaner for them while we attempted to recover what we could. When I returned with the loaner I had to take a shortcut through the area the showgirls used to prep for the show and damn was that place bustling. Some guy (I’m guessing the manager) even tossed me a skimpy shirt a few sizes too small for my bust and told me to get ready for stage when I was heading back out after plugging in their loaner. I tossed it back, told him about the computer and headed back to the shop to clock out. To be frank I kind of took it as a compliment that some guy thought me good looking enough to be on stage so I never told my boss about that part when he asked how the job went on Monday. ",

At our little VCS company, we are ordered to go above and beyond, which is why it is possible to see me installing a goddamn LDAP server for a customer.  Which ended up being used for production use.\n\nBut anyway.  That's the technical expertise level of some customers, like NotFinland (whose name I mistake for Finland sometimes) and NotGovernmentButContractor (NGbC, which is just as bad as the government).\n\nNGbC is getting a new server installed (yay! servers!) and is entirely unable to do so themselves.  \nBecause this is a large company who prides themselves (ostensibly) on security, I cannot control their computers via WebEx.  I have to explain what's going on.  They've also blocked connections to most of the rest of the internet, which is to say, I can't use my handy-dandy (but stupidly basic) automation scripts to get around most of the grunt work.\n\nBut did we know that? No.   \nDid I ask \"does this server have internet access?\" Yes.  \nWas I answered in the affirmative? Yes.  \nAnd if I knew how to turn off that block would my contact know to tell me it's a bad idea?  Of course not, that'd be intelligent.\n\nSo oops.  Guess this'll happen manually.  I wonder if I need something for high blood pressure. \n\nAnd it was torture.  Complete and utter hell.  Just to get 3/4 of the way there.  \nTwo hours later, MySQL is installed and configured.  The main VC daemon is present, and replication (from the old server) is configured.  I've muted him once every five minutes to swear I'm going to rip his throat out, there's no way you can misspell vi the wrong way that many times.  There's also no way you know the configuration differences between MySQL on old server (no root password, accessible as root remotely) and on new server (not any of that, because I'm not a complete moron).  Why do you think you're helping?\n\nUp next, startup and replication debugging.  \nI do this when I have control in 45 minutes.  \nLet's hope I don't say anything unforgiveable tomorrow, like \"can I just give instructions to your IT department?\"",

As it turned out, she was the one that hadn't approved the request to purchase the license that was both cheap and easily sourced by our procurement tech.  It was an alright 1st hour of the day, considering things like that happen on the daily.  \n",

As a result, the school relied on a few tech-savvy teachers and students (like myself) to help out with computer issues.\n\nBACKSTORY: There was a student who was vision impaired so he had a laptop with special software designed to read things out to him. He would attend some of the regular classes but would often have special one-on-one classes in one of the computer labs.  \n\nTHE ACTUAL STORY: I was in class one day and the teacher gets a call from the computer teacher (by that I mean the teacher that taught how to use Microsoft Word and Excel, and was by no means a computer tech.) in the CTS lab asking if I can come down and help them as this student's laptop  had shut off while he was using it and wouldn't turn back on.  \n\nI headed into the lab and as I approached the desk I immediately spotted the problem.  I leaned down below the desk, turned on the power bar, then turned the laptop on.  ",

        "text": "Some people in this world have really inadequate tech-skills, and some have inadequate people-skills, and that's understandable, I suppose - but some people... The Dark Abyss of Ignorance is a deep and dreary place, and it shall never cease to amaze me... Here is:\n\n**You Should Change Your Country Code**\n\n\n“Welcome to IT-Service desk, how can I help you?”\n\n“Yes, hello! I’m site administrator of our computers at [your average small-town], and I can’t access CertainWebEnvironment since this Friday!”\n\n*I get her user-ID. I start looking up what might have gone wrong, while she howls loudly from The Dark Abyss of Ignorance.*\n\n“I can’t believe how slow everything is loading today!”\n\n“Yeah, sometimes the computers get slow when it’s warm…”\n\n*Most users accept this as a piece of small-talk-information. Not her, though… She’s too smart for me!*\n\n“Yeah, well, it’s not warm in here – we have air conditioning in our office! Don’t you have AC in yours? That’s not why – usually when this many people are on vacation, it’s not this slow! Have you guys done something with the computers lately?”\n\n“Have we made your computers slow, Ma’am..? No, I really don’t think that we have…”\n\n“Well, it sure as day wasn’t me! Ah, and look at this, it doesn’t work! I can’t access WebEnvironment! And when I did have access to it three days ago, it looked weird!”\n\n“All right – let’s have a look at what might be the issue! Can you tell me the error message, please?”\n\n“It says I need permission to access the site – but I **have** permission! I’m **site administrator**! Something’s happened to WebEnvironment during the weekend, and it’s not my fault!”\n\n“No, no, that wouldn’t be your fault… Let’s see what we can do here. Is your computer in working order otherwise?”\n\n“Well… No!”\n\n“it isn't?”\n\n“I told you, they’re all slower than usual!”\n\n“All right… Um, we could try and clean it up a bit – clear clutter from your hard drive, restart it – because that’s pretty important to a computer. It doesn’t like being on for too long, especially when it’s warm.”\n\n“What? I *have* turned it off. Please don’t make assumptions that it’s *my* fault my computer is slow!”\n\n*I mute and sigh deeply at how adamant she is about how this is not her fault.*\n\n“All right, Ma’am, it was only a suggestion…”\n\n*I mumble something about annoying bitches. I let it run off me.*\n\n“Can I get your computer’s PN-number, please?”\n\n“Is that gonna help with my WebEnvironment?”\n\n*I bite my teeth together. Perhaps I should take her physical address from our system and have someone send her a big box of halfway decomposed frogs…*\n\n“All right, Ma’am, this is how it works – you tell me exactly what’s going on with WebEnvironment and I’ll do my absolute best to help you.” \n\n“Yes – that’s what we’ll do!”\n\n*Mute, in case of word diarrhea. I hear her click and huff and puff from The Abyss. She’s so flustered about not getting in, it would almost be heart breaking – if I weren't an extremely well-trained robot with a heart filled with titanium gears.*\n\n“There! I can’t get in, and it says, “Need permission to access site” – but I have permission! I’m *site administrator*!”\n\n*I mute, and I facepalm.*\n\n“Have you ordered an admin account, Ma’am?”\n\n“What do you mean? It’s the same account I always use!”\n\n“Yes, I understand it is - but have you ordered *admin access* to this particular part of WebEnvironment?”\n\n“No, I haven’t!”\n\n*She laughs. She laughs at me for my stupid, stupid, very relevant question.*\n\n“Then, if what you wish to do is get in here as admin, you need to order admin permissions…”\n\n“What do you mean? I’ve been site admin for a very long time and I’ve never had to order any rights!”\n\n“Well, it is a bit of a new procedure having to order thigs this particular way, but it has saved the company resources and time, for example, not having to install software on computers that the employees don’t even use or give accesses to people who don’t need them. And that you are admin of your *site* unfortunately doesn’t give you admin rights to Web Based Environments that affect a broad range of people and functions.” \n\n*And thank God in all his glory for that…*\n\n“What? That’s not how things were before!”\n\n“I understand that’s not how things were before, but if you could tell me exactly what you are trying to do, then perhaps I can help you or tell you what you need to order.”\n\n“I just need to do my job, exactly how I did *three days ago*! You say the procedures are new – were they set in place the day before yesterday??”\n\n*She explains – very poorly – what she is trying to accomplish on WebEnvironment, and after a while (and after actually conferring with a senior desk-buddy about it), I realize that she doesn’t actually need admin permissions. All she needs is a standard account – which she has. What the message is about might just be some dumb bug or, let’s say, a mistake-riddled mis-click on her part…*\n\n“Ma’am, can you do something for me? Could you click ‘Back’ for a second and tell me what the window says?”\n\n“Why? What’s that gonna help?”\n\n*She does do it, however.*\n\n“It says to login as me, with all my stuff in already, or with another account.”\n\n“Click the ‘other account’ one and then put in your own credentials, like you normally do.”\n\n*She grunts angrily.*\n\n“Now it says the username or password is wrong! That’s because I picked the other account – it knows it’s not me!”\n\n*I mute and almost choke on my chuckle.*\n\n“No, Ma’am, it only means your password has expired or been typed in wrong too many times in a row.”\n\n“Hey – it’s expired in that case! I didn’t do anything, it’s not my fault your passwords expire!”\n\n*Once again, she’s adamant about not having done anything wrong, which makes me think she has definitely done something very wrong at some point…”\n\n“All right, no, of course – you didn’t make your password expire – but you *will* need a new one. Can I take down a number I can reach you on..?”\n\n“It’s the number I’m calling from.”\n\n“That’s very well, Ma’am – but unfortunately, I can’t see it.”\n\n“What? Okay, that’s a bit weird… All right, my number is ‘34254989’.”\n\n“Thank you. I will reset the password and call you back in two minutes, all right?”\n\n“Two minutes!”\n\n“Aye – two minutes! Talk to you soon!”\n\n”Okay, bye!”\n\n*I reset her password, and – to no surprise of mine - it’s not expired; she’s locked herself out. I wait for two minutes and take fifteen extra seconds to mentally prepare for once again letting my ear get deep into The Abyss.*\n\n*I call her. No answer. Many, many tones go out, but there’s all but silence from The Abyss.*\n\n*That’s strange... I double check the number she’s given me. It should be her number…*\n\n*I try again. This time, she picks up – sounding incredibly agitated.*\n\n“Who is this??”\n\n”Thank you for waiting, Ma’am! This is UnintentionalAss, from IT Service, and I’ve…”\n\n“So that *was* you!” \n\n”Um, Ma’am..?”\n\n”Why are you calling from such a strange number?!”\n\n“Strange number, Ma’am?”\n\n“Yes – that’s a strange number! How are people supposed to answer when we have no idea what that strange number is?!”\n\n*Oh – I see the issue! It starts with a B and ends with a cold, heavy rain…*\n\n“You mean that it’s a different country code than your own? Well, I suppose that’s not usually such a problem for us…”\n\n“Well, you should change it!”\n\n“We should… *change* our country code..?”\n\n“Yes! How’s one supposed to realize it’s IT calling when it could be just anyone with a crazy number – maybe you’re calling to scam me or something!”\n\n*I mute to slap myself in the face. Hard. She keeps going.*\n\n“You’re in IT, aren’t you? One would think there’d be a way for you to change what the number looks like, to let us know who’s calling, so that we know to answer! I never answer with outlandish numbers!”\n\n*This conversation escalated quickly…*\n\n“Um, I’m sorry that we scared you, Ma’am, but, most people *do* see that it’s a number from practically next door…”\n\n“Oh, do they, now..? How would you know? Does everyone answer when you call back every time??”\n\n“Um…”\n\n“See, we’ve been warned about answering when strange numbers call us!”\n\n*I see before me how she sits in The Abyss, reading an article on facebook on Nigerian phone scammers… I have to deflect, or this will go on forever.*\n\n“I’ll make a note to my higher ups then, that we should definitely change the country code for this country! Now - since you’re at the computer and fully ready, let’s try the new password! Make sure that Caps Lock is not on, make sure you have typed in your user-ID correctly and let’s add you as ‘Another User’, and perhaps we can cut into this!”\n\n*I speak a little too quickly, so she doesn't have time to interject or hear that I actually just insulted her intellect in a somewhat subtle manner… She mumbles and she types.*\n\n“What’s the password, then?”\n\n“First letter Capital, all right? [Quebec, Uniform, Echo, Echo, Foxtrot, Zero, Zero].”\n\n*I wait. She types. She grunts. She grunts again.*\n\n”It works...” \n\n*She almost sounds disappointed.*\n\n”It works? And how does it look inside of WebEnvironment?”\n\n“There’s still something wrong here! It doesn’t look like it usually looks!”\n\n*I mute to sigh and rub my temples. Issues within their WebEnvironment are usually tricky and take time to solve, and usually need to be escalated to specialized teams – which would be fine, if this user wasn’t such a…*\n\n“Can I ask your permission to remote control your computer, Ma’am? That way, I can get in and see what you see, and I can help you a little easier.”\n\n“All right, fine. Do I have to do something?”\n\n*I instruct her in how to start up the program I need to remote in.*\n\n“Now, while this is starting up, could you tell me what’s wrong, so that I know what to look for?”\n\n“What do you mean? It just doesn’t look like it did before, you guys must have messed with it, or my computer is broken some way.”\n\n“What I mean is, WebEnvironment is a huge environment and it doesn’t look exactly the same for everyone, even under [BigCompany that owns her DaughterCompany]. You have different apps, you organize files differently and so on…”\n\n“Ah, yes – that’s one of the problems! I can’t find anything! And even the *logo* looks weird! Like the pixels are wrong!”\n\n*Ah, great – someone’s learned the word ‘pixels’! Now, if she only could learn what it means and how it works… And then, I realize, I think I know what the problem is, and I cross all my fingers and toes in a prayer that I’m right.*\n\n*We get in. I actually raise my face towards the ceiling and thank God.*\n\n*I’m right!*\n\n*I un-mute, and I clear my throat.*\n\n“Aah – I see what the confusion is about, Ma’am! It’s the update! You should have gotten an e-mail about an update, have you not?”\n\n“What e-mail? What update?”\n\n“Just this superficial update – to the logo, for instance – and for where the shared folders are and whatnot – still right here!”\n\n*I take over her mouse and I click on her shared folders, that have been moved from a little arrow on the left, to a little arrow on the right.*\n\n“Are you sure that’s it?”\n\n“Positive, Ma’am. This is the way it’s supposed to look now.”\n\n“Really…? All right… I liked it better the old way, it was much easier to see! But okay, okay, then it was as I said – it wasn’t something *I* did!”\n\n*I shake my head once more.*\n\n“That’s all good, Ma’am – I can officially confirm that you did in fact not update WebEnvironment during the weekend… If that’s all..?”\n\n“That’s all. Good.”\n\n”Do I have your permission to close my case, Ma’am?”\n\n“I guess so.”\n\n“Thank you, Ma’am – and don’t hesitate to call if anything else should be the matter!”\n\n“All right. Thanks for the password. Good-bye!”\n\n\n*She hangs up. I sigh so much air out of my lungs, I almost deflate. Some people, man – some people!*\n\n",

        "text": "So this happened last week and I'm an IT Tech. \n\nI was working with my co-worker installing a rack-mounted NAS on a Friday, about an hour and a half before closing time. Out of nowhere the PR Generalist comes bursting in to the server room saying how there was some kind of video the old PR Manager was supposed to do for an outside company, but he quit before the project was completed, and the company has already paid my company and are now threatening to cut off all business ties unless they get this video. So I need to set up a workstation for our former manager so he can work on it next week. \n\nWell, the former manager comes in that next week and claims he can't find any of the files on his old computer. In a panic, the PR Generalist comes into my office, so I show her how to search a computer for any specific file types, as well as created a shortcut on her desktop to all of the PR Managers old files (she is using his old computer). Apparently that wasn't enough because a couple hours later the Generalist comes back to my office because she still can't find these files. I begrudgingly go to her workstation and within 10 minutes I have the files located. The Generalist, almost in tears, thanks me profusely and I firmly place myself on the \"saves the day\" pedestal and sigh thinking I can put this dumb situation behind me and concentrate on my actual job duties. \n\nThe next day, again, the Generalist comes into my office in a panic because she was going through the Managers old files and was \"cleaning out some of his old files\" and informed me that she deleted the files they were looking for. Being Windows (10 at that), the files were too big so they were permanently deleted. I tried running Recuva and nothing was able to be successfully restored. \n\nAfter about 2 hours of working on it, I washed my hands of the situation. I have no idea what the fallout is going to be for her and her department, but after all of the commotion and above-and-beyonding I've had to do, I really don't care.",

        "text": "Having escaped a hellish IT environment, I might as well share some tales from my times there. \n\nA year ago, my boss announced that a few heavy use printers were getting replaced with newer models that could handle the load. There was nothing wrong with the printers, but seeing as the decision was above my pay grade, I went along with the plan. \n\nWithin a few days, there were 3 printers delivered. 2 hefty MFPs, and 1 laser printer. The replacements are set in place and the 2 older MFPs are wheeled out. My boss requested that the old laser printer be kept aside in case someone needs a replacement. I inform my co-worker since my shift ended 30 minutes ago and rush to class. \n\nThe next morning I get a phone call: \n\n* **$Me - Part time worker who is chasing the \"non-existent\" full time position people keep mentioning**\n* **$User- end user from unliked department**\n* **$Boss - Barks orders and approves time sheet. Can never be found when needed.** \n* **$Coworker - Basically full time version of my position but acts more like my boss than my actual boss**\n* **$User2- Similar position as $User, but can/will be meaner**\n* **$BigBoss - Boss's boss, lets boss get away with things since they are not comfortable with tech.** \n* **$PM- No filter, cool person**\n\n&gt;**$Me - IT**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$User- The new printer isn't printing correctly. Its crooked and must be on some drugs cause its printing different colors.** \n\nLooks at clock and it just hit 8AM aka I sense a long day ahead\n\nI skip the phone support and walk over to the department where I am faced with a printer who just puked toner on paper and called it a print job. Its still early and my brain isn't in troubleshooting mode yet, so I phone my coworker to get an update. \n\n&gt;**$Me - Yo $Coworker, was the new printer in department X working yesterday?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - Yeah, why?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - Its puking toner on paper**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - wut????**\n\n*Sends him picture of print jobs*\n\n&gt;**$Coworker - Oh that, it did that yesterday as well. I just left the toner door open and let it dry out some.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - ...... uhh**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - Try that out and if it doesn't work call support.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - Ok, what about crooked prints?**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - I didn't see anything yesterday, try and fix it**\n\n*end call*\n\nAs per instructions, I document the instructions and proceed to follow them. I inform $End of the scenario and connect them to another printer. All is well.......for the next 15 minutes. \n\n*phone rings*\n\n&gt;**$Me - I...**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$User2- Why isn't the printer working?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - $End put in a request since it was not working properly. I am implementing a solution and am coming over to check it out. In the mean time, do you need to print something out asap?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$User2- NO! I will get $User to print it out for me**\n\n*phone slams down*\n\nThe time is now 8:25AM\n\nI stroll over, close the toner door and proceed to print roughly 20 pages (4 separate jobs) and all are clean. Also notice that the alignment is on point, but just to play it safe I ask $User to print out the print job with the alignment issue. They do, and the alignment is still off. I play with the settings, but cannot get it perfectly without...\n\n1. Messing up the alignment of other items in that specific print job\n2. Messing up other print jobs\n3. An influx of phone calls (BTW we have a ticketing system, but no one uses it)\n\nIts 8:45AM so i decide to put in a request to the printer tech support. The request is made and I ask for an ETA......I get nothing from them, so I let $Boss know and he gets it escalated. The technician comes in a few hours later and I spend another 1.5 hours trying to get this to work with the tech, but get nowhere. He gets frustrated, sets things back to default and heads out as he has another call to take. $User and $User2 send a lengthy email to $Coworker, $Boss and $BigBoss and attempt to use me to back up their claims. I speak with $Coworker about the matter and he advises that we talk to $Boss about it. \n\n$Boss makes a few phone calls and gets a few engineers from printer company to come take a look at the machine. They deem it defective, but do not take it back since it was ordered via 3rd party. $User2 requests old printer back....and that's where things get interesting. \n\n&gt;**$Boss - Guys where is the old printer**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - I don't know. I relayed your message to $Coworker and left for class.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - The company took it away for recycling, I'll call them and request it back.** \n\n*An hour later*\n\n&gt;**$Coworker - They can't find the printer. They have no record of taking it back.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Boss - Let me make some calls.** \n\nAs he makes his calls, $BigBoss catches me near the break room\n\n&gt;**$BigBoss - I saw the email from $User2, you know we are suppose to provide quality service to the company.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - That was an outside technician who we use whenever we have severe printer issues**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$BigBoss - But how does that make IT look??**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - We are working on it and will resolve it in a timely manner.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$BigBoss - Is $Coworker in? Maybe he should handle this?** \n\nI am fully capable of doing the tasks assigned to me, but $BigBoss loves to undermine my skills whenever she can. \n\n&gt;**$Me - I'll go check (aka im walking away now)**\n\n3 days later, the printer magically appears and is in place at that department. They are happy, $BigBoss is off my back and I proceed to close out the ticket. That defective printer ends up sitting in our storage and $Boss does nothing to return it. It sits there for roughly 9 months before this happens....\n\n&gt;**$PM- Hey $Me, do y'all have a spare printer? I hate having to go to the big printer down the hall.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - There is one, but its got an alignment issue.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$PM - How bad is it?** \n\nI fetch the printer, hook it up and they run a few test prints to it. Issue is not a factor since what they print aligns perfectly. \n\n&gt;**$Me - How the??**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$PM - I see no issue here...**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - But me and $Coworker saw this have an issue**\n\nAttention turned to $Coworker\n\n&gt;**$PM - Does this printer have an alignment issues?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - Not that i'm aware of**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - Don't you remember that saga from earlier**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Coworker - No...**\n\n*\\*sigh\\**\n\nAs PM enjoys her new printer, $Coworker pulls me aside. \n\n&gt;**$Coworker - Why did you tell them about that printer?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me - Department needed a printer, we had a printer with an issue, they saw that it was non-issue and accepted the printer. Printer is no longer sitting collecting dust, mission accomplished.** \n\n$Coworker walks away disgusted. I log the ticket and proceed to leave for the day. ",

        "text": "Hello TFTS,\n\nA little story today, not really an amazing one, but I thought it could still be worth sharing.\n\nSo to give a little bit of context, we are in an open space environment here, with electric desks (you know, those desks with an adjustable height), and we have two electric plugs on the upper left corner of the desk, and on each electric plug, there is also two USB ports. So basically, users have more than enough space to plug their laptops, and eventually their mobile phone charger.\n\nNow, for the story in itself, anything related to electric equipments or furniture in general are not handled by IT but by a building manager, who is also in charge of assigning lockers, creating access cards, etc...\n\nSince she recently arrived here, she isn't too familiar with some equipments and after hearing complaints about an electric plug that wasn't working on a desk in the second floor, she asked us if we could take a look at it. Our manager agreed and I went to check on the desk, I plugged my phone and its charger on the first plug, and it worked. Then on the second plug... it didn't.\n\nI raised the desk, and opened up the case below the desk, where all the wires are passing through to, then, reach the ground. And one of the electric plug was indeed disconnected.\n\nSince I also found a little desk lamp beside of the desk, I suppose that a user wanted to plug it but not on his desk, or maybe was he already using the two plugs, so he raised the desk, opened the case, randomly disconnected a wire and plugged his desk lamp. He then disconnected it too... without reconnecting the previous plug. And as we're in flexwork, there is no way to know who did that, unfortunately. I don't even know why they would need a desk lamp, as we're currently in summer here, so we have long days with sunlight, the desk isn't located in some dark corner of the building, it's actually right next to a window, and all the lights on the ceiling are working...\n\nUsers will remain users, I guess.",

        "text": "Preamble: Not technically a tech support job but I am the informal tech support for the night cable team at a datacenter. I was put on a project with someone who is very technologically inept and just generally not all that bright. He fairly routinely needed help with his laptop. Honestly the only reason he still has a job is nepotism.\n\nCopypasta: There are several ways to copy and paste. If you use computers you generally find one you like and keep using it. The person I got stuck with apparently knew none, despite him being about 35-45. If somehow you make it through many years of life with computers without having to learn something like that I would simply teach you. I showed him two ways actually. Then a day or two later I showed him again... then again... then someone else had to teach him a few times, and then a few more people tried.... After I think about a dozen attempts across 5 different people he \\*may\\* have finally remembered how to copy and paste. \n\nServer or local copy: Part of our job includes editing a spreadsheet stored on a sharepoint site. Not terribly difficult. The excel web app has most of the features needed and is required for multiple people to edit the same spreadsheet at the same time. Unless you cache a copy and open it in excel. The problem with doing that is when you tell it to save back to the server, if someone else has made a change it doesn't know how to merge them. Usually not a big deal, the easiest way to avoid it without having to use the web app is to make sure nobody else is working on it and save your changes before you leave. Well my coworker failed to save, left for the night with the spreadsheet still open. As would happen someone during the day changed the spreadsheet. Coworker comes in the next day and is unable to save (to his credit he actually read the error message, though was unable to comprehend it). The computer is prompting him to keep server copy or keep local copy, To me the obvious solution is keep server and just reenter the small amount of data from the day before. I tell him this and explain that it will erase the progress he made so he will have to enter it again. A few minutes later he is once again complaining... because he cant find any of the information he entered the day before. I reiterate that what I told him to do erased it and he will have to re enter it. His reasoning? 'well i didn't believe you, I thought you were just kidding around'.\n\nNote: Yes I may have been able to recover it from excel's autosaves, but I don't really like him and wasn't about to volunteer to do extra work for him.",

A couple of the users have OCD as it relates to work - their inbox needs to be completely empty at the end of the day, their desktop cannot have any icons that are absolutely necessary, their windows settings must be tweaked exactly to their liking, etc.   Since I'm friendly with them I don't mind helping, even if it's just doing crap they could do by googling.\n\nOne of these OCD users had been having issues with Citrix Reciever that we could not solve, so we decided to nuke Windows over the weekend and start over.  So of course today after the weekend there was a ton of personalized settings to fix. I spent 90 minutes and helped fix most of it (Outlook sending notifications to the Action Center, for instance).   Then the user asks if we can make the default font (Calibri Bold 11) bigger in Outlook. I said \"Sure, is it too small?\"  She replies back \"No, I just can't stand having it be an odd number so I want to be 12\".\n\nCould not help letting out a laugh :)",
