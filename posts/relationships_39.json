Today was especially sad as i was assaulted on a train and texted him and he went online but ignored my message and shut off his phone. i guess he doesnt want his holiday disrupted. he knows im pretty much alone as i cut contact with my mother because of her abuse and illness isolated me very much and im in a new city. he isnt even worried about me in the slightest which is something i noticed many times\n\nTL; DR: My father lies to me all the time mainly out of self-interest and I dont know if I should just ignore it until I can gain a way out of financial dependence. i feel very sad",

For years I have tried to make myself feel anything, but I don't.  Recently in an argument, she threatened to leave if she didn't get her way, and I felt so relieved by the idea that there was a way out... that I realized I was being a chicken not saying anything.\n\nI have told her before that I haven't been happy, but I have never asked to end the relationship.  The problem is, the only two relationships I ever ended myself ended BADLY.  One, in highschool, after only three weeks of dating, the person attempted... unaliving.  Once, in grad school, I ended up in an emotionally abusive relationship where the person threatened to ruin my life, somehow took my friends (I don't know what was said to them), and outed me to my family to punish me for breaking up with them.  I haven't broken up with anyone since them, but needless to say I find myself anxious thinking about it now.\n\nI know she won't retaliate, but I don't want to hurt her worse than necessary.  I don't know if it's better to go gradually or all at once.  Pull away or stay kind and close... or if that will make it feel like it's out of the blue? \n\nBasically I'm hoping people who were in relationships that ended on a good note could share some things that went well, things you're glad happened, or even things you wish your partner did.  Because I care a lot about her and, in a perfect world, I'd like for us to go from being distant partners to good and close friends (although I realize that might not be possible or may take some time) \n---\n**tl;dr**: Looking for advice for how to start the conversation about breaking up/end a long term relationship while causing the least amount of pain to the other party",

She wanted to have sex which I did not want to do due to not having protection but she claimed \"nahh the pull out method works dw abt it\".\n\nI knew that pull out method is bs so told her no, we can play around in other ways. Anyways, i did NOT have penetrative sex and finished on her stomach/legs, she said she gonna go bathroom to clean up and then we can chill. During post nut revelation I realised i do not like this girl and wanted to cut things off as i felt we just didnt vibe like that and i didnt want to be in a relationship.\n\nSo after a week of talking I tell her that I wanna focus on myself and just want to stop talking to her and everyone (i didnt wanna ghost as it seemed rude, so made up some shit excuse to break it off). Turns out she didnt like that and cussed me out a bunch. I then ghosted her and after 2/3 weeks she tells me she missed her period.\n\nI asked her how thats possible if we didnt have sex to which she didnt reply. After abt another week she sent me a snap through some fake account holding a positive pregnancy test. I freaked TF OUT. I messaged and tried calling etc but she did not respond. She says she is keeping it and gonna rat me out to my family when her pregnancy becomes obvious to the ppl around her and we gonna be together and get married (religious parents so she knows thats what they will force me to do). Since that threat/convo she hasnt talked to me and its been like 8 weeks.\n\nits been almost 12 weeks and i now found out she told my siblings she is pregnant and has been posting stories one her snap/insta/fb abt morning sickness cures and baby photos and hints like \"what to expect when your expecting\" type crap. Womens day she sent snaps on her story abt looking forward to being a mother...she getting more brazen and open abt being pregnant and its having a negative toll on my life to the point where getting out of bed is a struggle and sleeping is something that I no longer have control over.\n\nIs it possible for her to have gone to the bathroom and used the semen to get pregnant some way? I saw a recent photo of her and she did look fatter than before...im scared and alone and cant turn to anyone of my friends or fam as she has already been feeding them hints and if i ask they gonna assume im the father without asking for further evidence. The lack of dialogue from her end has messed me up so I have no clarity on the situation. \n\nMoral of the story: Dont stick your dick in crazy...infact dont even bring it close to crazy :/\n\n TL;DR Girl I met once and didnt have penetrative sex is claiming she is pregnant to blackmail me into her life and cause issues in my personal fam. \n\nplz help reddit",

        "text": "Tldr; My crippling anxiety is bleeding into my relationship with my gf and her family. They don‚Äôt know I have anxiety and believe I hate them because I don‚Äôt show up to a lot of their family functions. Do you have any advice or words of wisdom? \n\n\n\n\nMY BACKGROUND : \nI‚Äôve been dealing with social anxiety and depression for most of my life. It seems like it has gotten worse as I‚Äôve aged and sadly it‚Äôs putting a strain on my relationship with my gf and her family. Much like everyone on the planet, I have my good and bad days. Id say I have about 3 good day each week, followed by 4 bad ones where even making my bed is a challenge. My bad days oftentimes leave me feeling anxious, overwhelmed, weak, pathetic, sad, angry, and overall helpless. In general, it‚Äôs very hard to converse with others when you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.\n\n\nSITUATION:\nI‚Äôve dated my girlfriend for almost 4 years. Her family is very religious and hosts lots of direct family get togethers. Most of those events are sports oriented, followed by the usual birthdays and holidays. I‚Äôm not much of a sports guy so I find it hard to attend those gatherings because it‚Äôs usually just me sitting on the couch pinching/picking at my skin because I think that everyone is judging me about how awkward I‚Äôm being. Most of the time I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself at their house so i just stand out of everyone‚Äôs way, speak when spoken to, and do my best not to fall over and die. You can probably imagine why I have issues attending get togethers. It‚Äôs like placing my hand on a hot stove top knowing damn well it‚Äôs going to burn my hand. Im not going to want to do it. \n\n\nISSUE:\nMy girlfriend has jumped on my case about not attending her family‚Äôs gatherings. She says that she feels weird because everyone else has their SOs with them and she‚Äôs just by herself. \nHer family cracks jokes about me being a ghost because I never show up to things and they have this idea that I hate them. \nRecently my GF‚Äôs oldest sister had a birthday party, but I couldn‚Äôt attend because people in my house have covid. Because of this, her dad made a comment stating that they‚Äôll never see her again if we end up getting married. Apparently, my GF‚Äôs middle sister was/is pissed at me for not showing up either. This may have been fueled by me missing my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday party a couple months ago because I had a stomach bug. I celebrated my gf‚Äôs birthday alone with her the day before I got sick, so it‚Äôs not like I forgot. \nI hardly ever speak about myself to anyone so they don‚Äôt know what kind of mental issues I deal with. \n\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\nMy girlfriend is valid for feeling the way she does. If the roles were reversed I would also want her at my family events too. However, I feel like her family gets together more than most. \nI think her dad was out of pocket when he made that comment. Even if we were married it‚Äôs not like I could/would force her not to show up to their family functions. \n\n\nQUESTION: \nWhat do I do in this situation? Do I need to disclose to her family that I‚Äôm just fucked in the head and would gladly be at their gatherings if it weren‚Äôt for that? Im at my wits end because I don‚Äôt think I can change quickly enough for them. Perhaps the expectation of me being there would be different if my gf and I were actually engaged/married. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Perhaps I‚Äôm just not healthy enough to be in any kind of relationship.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm just looking for a little advice on a situation I have found myself in 3 days ago concerning my long-distance boyfriend, who I have been dating for 3 months, and his homophobic father. Just to clarify, I‚Äôm 18 and he is 19. We are both currently not financially independent. Our relationship first started on one of the dating apps. I am from the UK but I changed settings to place myself in Spain, as I was planning to move there shortly at the time. He is from Cuba and so he must‚Äôve done the same. He popped up in my dm‚Äôs and first started speaking to me in English, but then we moved to Spanish (which I do not speak and use a translator for) because his English is not good. We get on well, many cute and funny times, sending photos of each other, what where we live looks like, family pictures, many compliments, speaking not on FaceTime or phone calls, but through voice notes trying to teach each other words in our respective languages which was cute and funny. One day the mention of how we would meet came up, and as we don‚Äôt have jobs yet, the plan was in a couple of months when we had enough money we would sort that out. No definite plan though. One day he told me his father is extremely homophobic, and so we both agreed that he shouldn‚Äôt tell his father about us as there was a strong risk of him being kicked out or something worse. He said he thought his mother would be more chilled though. Days ago, after ending our last conversation with kisses, he texted me telling me that he had told his father, that it went horribly, and that now he is going to ‚Äúbe straight‚Äù and ‚Äúleave the bi thing behind. I‚Äôm very sorry‚Äù. He then blocked me on WhatsApp. The day after, unexpectedly, he send me a text saying ‚ÄúHow are we going to meet, I still have much affection for you‚Äù and he replied about 20 mins later with ‚ÄúFor now, we can be great friends‚Äù. He blocks me again after those messages. I know there is no definitive way to know, and not much I can do while blocked. \n\nTL;DR I know he has a lot of affection for me, and is a very sweet and empathetic person, and I suspect the sole reason for blocking me isn‚Äôt personal but due to the pressure and threats from his father and family. What do you guys think of the situation? Thanks, Jacob.",

        "text": "First of all I apologize for any mistakes I make in writing this and am sorry if it is confusing, I am tired and frustrated.\n\nI think that a little background is needed. I (43/f) and my best friend (46/m) have been close for almost 10 years. I am disabled and we lived together for 7 years, but now both live with family to help them out, in different states. When we lived together he was VERY supportive and understanding. (If you have any further questions, let me know)\n\nSo a couple years ago, in the middle of the pandemic, I highly encouraged my best friend to do what I thought was best and get vaccinated although he is against it. I was even a bit pushy. He did eventually get it and things were fine.\n\nNow, yesterday he tells me that he cannot fully trust me because I \"forced\" him to get the vaccine and that there is not enough information about it and that I may have caused him harm. I honestly had no idea that this was the way he felt, and especially did not realize he was holding this against me now. I apologized for being pushy, because I would hate being pressured into doing something with my body that I did not want to do, but said that I only did what I thought was best for him and for me as I am immunocompromised.\n\nWell I have tickets to go see him in May, and I am not sure what I should do about it. He has said that I cannot earn back his trust and I don't want this to ruin my vacation and cannot afford to cancel the trip. He is going to be my only form of transportation in a state that I have never been to.\n\nI know that this will not end our friendship, but I fear that things will never be the same.\n\nWhat should I do about the fact that he doesn't trust me? What should I do about my trip? What do I do about this friendship?\n\n(If you have any questions, I will answer them)\n\nTL;DR - \"Pushed\" a friend into getting the vaccine, it's been years and I just found out he is still mad at me and says he can't fully trust ever.",

Both times, I would have doubts in the beginning of the relationship because the other person is way more committed than I am. Then, I would let them know about my doubts and they would both cry and try to still keep in contact with me. I would then agree, and soon enough develop feelings for them. Some conflict will come up, I communicate and we don't see eye to eye or we are just not compatible. I never tell them I want to end it, but I will say that I was thinking of breaking up but still considering if it's fixable. Then they will breakup with me right after, without planning of it earlier, and then regret it within minutes and try to come back to me.\n\n TL;DR: Why do men always break up with me first because they sense my doubts, and then regret it right after?",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I met two months ago in a friend group and we immediately clicked. I wasn't emotionally very available at that time that's why I wasn't sure about getting into a new relationship but he was so caring and understanding that I started to like him. In the third week of flirting phase, I visited my hometown for one week and some problems aroused. He works for long hours all day but he still spared time for his friends and they played online games all the time. I understood his need of socialising with others but in the meantime, we talked little and he never called me. Then I talked to him about this, how I felt and he understood me and apologised. I said maybe we should go slow and he said that he thought we were boyfriend and girlfriend but he accepted. Two days later, I came back to the city we both live and everything was good. We missed each other a lot, and we spent lots of time together at home and became official. However, for the past two weeks, everything is very monotonous. He works full time while I work part time and our homes are far from each other. My schedule is very tight because I also do some translation works and I still have school but I can make time for him. I go to his place to spend time with him in the evening or at night because he doesn't have time during the day.\nAt first, it was fun to hang out at home but it started to bore me because after we became official, we literally had just one date outside and it wasn't something planned. I showed my excitement for it during the date and said that we should do it more often. \nThree days ago, he became very sick and I immediately went to his home to take care of him even though I had close deadlines. I did everything I could. I took him to the hospital and waited all night, bought and cooked healthy food&amp;drinks for him, I even washed him because he had a fever and cleaned his home. At first, he wasn't willing to make me do all these but later on, he expected me to do extra things like massaging him. I love him that's why I don't see taking care of him as a burden but when he stopped saying thank you, I realised that maybe I gave too much for a new relationship. \nToday, I was at his home and he came after work. I bought groceries and cooked for him again and I do all these instinctively. He didn't talk too much as we were sitting, I was looking at my computer for something related to work, then he said he wanted to go his room, lay down and watch reels videos. I felt disappointed because although I was at his home for three days, we never spent time together because he was sick and I was feeling overwhelmed. He saw my disappointment and didn't understand why. Then I couldn't help myself and started to argue. I was keeping things to myself for some time and I asked why we don't spend quality time together. After becoming official, we only had only one date outside because his friend cancelled their plan in the last minute in his off day. He said he couldn't think of it before because he was happy with spending time at home but I said all we do at home is listening to music, talking a little and most of the time having sex. I asked him why he loves me and at first he didn't answer me a proper answer. Towards the end of the conversation, he confessed that he loves me because of the things I do for him all the time, such as caring and nurturing him etc. I felt very disappointed and sad. He said that he doesn't want to break up with me and he will try to spend more time with me but added that if I want, we can breakup. When I heard this, I felt myself irreplaceable and used. He apologised and explained himself but I am still not satisfied. I am aware that because I'm his first, he really doesn't know how to act sometimes but I remember my first relationship. Everything progressed very naturally and I still do everything instinctively because I don't see my relationship as a duty. \nI feel like he lost his excitement and curiosity for me because I have started to give him so much love and care. I know that he loves me but I am not sure of the source of his love. I don't want to break up but I am afraid of having a heartbreak in the future. \nWhat should I do?\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend doesn't want to spend time with me apart from having sex",

        "text": "\nSo as the title said, my girlfriend of 9 months thinks I don‚Äôt want or desire her just because we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúenough sex‚Äù for her. \n\nI see her a few times a week, and we both work longish hours. Most of the time, I‚Äôm so beat from work, I don‚Äôt have the cardio energy to have sex. \nAfter I got Covid, months before I met her, my parts had issues getting hard. \nA lot of the time, it‚Äôs a mental thing for me since sometimes I‚Äôd get soft when we had sex. I would get insecure and have performance anxiety. I told her that and she said ‚Äúwell how come you‚Äôre always hard if I want to blow you or give you a hand job‚Äù\n\nEven when I don‚Äôt want to have sex, she always is down to give me oral sex or please me, but I feel bad that I can‚Äôt please her as\nMuch as she‚Äôd like. We only have sex like once a week. And I haven‚Äôt had sex for 7 years before I met her so she thinks that I should be constantly desiring her. \n\nSometimes I just want to cuddle and vibe with her. I like having my butt played with and I feel like that‚Äôs the thing that REALLY gets me going. She‚Äôs open to doing that but kinda gets grossed out I feel when I ask her to do certain things. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. Or if she‚Äôs pressuring me. Or if I just have something else going on. She says that I turn her down more than we actually have sex. \n\nTLDR: gf feels like I don‚Äôt want her since we don‚Äôt have sex as much as she‚Äôs used to. I‚Äôm just so tired after work and she feels it‚Äôs one sided",

        "text": "after our first date we spent an entire week together, then I left her for a week but we kept face timing for hours every day and already had a boyfriend-girlfriend type of dynamic. Then we met again in a different country where she went to visit family.\n\nShe chose to sleep at my place every day, for three weeks, we would have breakfast together and go on dates in the evening. During the day she would go see her family. We were as close to each other as we are right now. Scrolled up our chats. They were the same as now. Thats a bit scary. Same words, same dynamic, me asking her where is, she sending me updates. telling me how much I mean to her etc. We just had this instant connection to each other from the very beginning.\n\nThe second week she was already telling me that she is falling in love with me and that this is extremely special to her etc. this is when this happened. (third week she dropped the 'I love you')\n\nShe recently told me, she went to see a 'friend' for a few minutes just to check up with him and that he confessed his love for her (she is super pretty, these type of things happen often). She said she didn't tell me about it back then but I was like it's fine. It was just a friend as I see and super unnecessary.\n\nThen after we talked about it further, she told me that she went to his place to meet him and that he kissed her. She insisted that this guy kissed her and that she didn‚Äôt do anything but it didn't make no sense to me as when a guy kisses a girl she can always block it which she didn‚Äôt.\n\nShe confessed to me that they kissed but then she felt uncomfortable and left she said.\n\nThen she said she just kissed him because she felt bad for him because he told her that his life went to shit since they broke up at 13 as she further confessed that this guy was her first boyfriend when she was like 13 but they had never had slept together or anything and she just wanted to go see him as they happened to be in the same city out of coincidence and she really wanted to hear what he is up to. (keep in mind it is not her home town.\n\nWe were as close as we are right now to each other, talked the same way, said the same things. at the second week of being with me, she one day left to meet a couple she said.\n\nThat night, she was sleeping at my place, I even brought her to the city. She said she was gonna meet a couple from school and lied to me about everything. After their meeting she came back home to me and acted like she met this couple. A week after this she confessed her love to me.\n\nI don't know what to think. I would have never been able to pull this off. Now she says she thought I was a player and she was thinking that I was playing her.. Which might have seemed that way maybe but I was always very honest to her, gave her all my attention and most importantly time.\n\nShe had told me from the beginning that she is monogamous, would never see multiple people at the same time and so did I. Also since she was acting like my girlfriend and telling me all those nice things about her feelings and was truly acting like her eyes only saw me, I just felt like I owed her this. I felt like I'd be an absolutely shit person if I did so. Come on.. She was sleeping at my place every night, I was telling her all these sweet things too, taking her on daily dates, she was acting like head over heels in love with me (so quickly). I could have never seen anyone else during this time.\n\nShe told me she just lied about this in the first place because she couldn't tell me she was meeting a male friend who was her first boyfriend but actually didn't mean anything to her.\n\nI talked to her aunt about it, who knows everything about her life. She told me that she feels nothing for this guy and that she really never met this guy ever again after that. She also told me that she is very obsessed with me that she would never do anything like this ever in the relationship and I can truly see that she loves me so does her aunt.\n\nShe also told me that she was always very monogamous in every relationship she had and would never ever do something. As she is and was talking about me all time time with her since she met me. She is telling her whole family that she wants to marry me one day. That she wants to have my kids. Also introduced me to her mother. Who she never introduced to anyone before me.\n\nThe confession actually came after she started to tell her whole family about marrying me and setting dates to introduce me to them. She is very determined now to show me that i can trust her. She confessed me all about two weeks ago. For an entire week she was crying and having panic attacks all the time, as she was really regretting what she had done and was afraid that I was gonna leave her what I actually was in the beginning then I decided to give her a second chance. Now she is just sad and afraid that I will never be able to trust her but she keeps saying that we belong together and how much I mean for her.\n\nAlso happens to be that I have a common friend with this guy, he actually really is very bad with women and a total weirdo what would justify the things she said about him. I could also just ask for the truth.\n\nWhat would you do in my case? I am crazy in love with her. I still truly believe she is a nice person.\n\nTLDR: Me and my gf were as close as were are now from very early on. She used to sleep at my place spend whole day with me. During this time she says she went to meet an old friend to catch up with him at his place. who she then kissed because she felt bad for him, as he confessed his love for her and how his whole life went shit since they broke up at 13 (he was her first boyfriend).",

Our friendship completely ended yesterday and I knew it was going to.\n\nTwo or so days ago was the first time in ten or so years I seen him in person and I liked who I saw. I liked the man I saw and spent time with, not the boy I had a crush on so long ago. I had butterflies again and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt them for ANYONE.\n\nWe eat at a restaurant (I paid because I told him he had done so much for me during our friendship in ways that are priceless) and we had a good time. At least /I/ did.\n\nLater on In the night of the same day we talked about my feelings because we both spoke of living our lives and really being truthful. So I asked him if he would go on a date with me, a real one, just one and of course I knew I was going to be turned down. Which I told him I knew the answer was no.\n\nThe conversation kind of veered and it went all the way down south. I was so disrespected and humiliated. One of the things he said when I asked why I was unblocked, although he kept refusing to give me an answer, was that he wanted to possibly have a FWB situation or sort of appear in each other‚Äôs lives if someone is horny. He also told me that our friendship will never be the same as it was since his most recent girlfriend broke up with him recently.\n\nI am just really hurting. I thought we had a friendship that was truly solid. I understand his feelings and being hurt considering where he is at in life right now. I don‚Äôt understand him being so cruel under the guise of honesty.\n\nI have no idea how I am ever going to stop loving him and letting go of wishing we had that date.\n\nTL;DR I am in love with my best and he has no interest in me and I‚Äôm devastated.\n\nEdit: typos",

I don‚Äôt know this girl \n2. She seems to be latching onto my boyfriend but maybe that‚Äôs me\n\nMy boyfriend talks about me at work. So he said she knows he has a girlfriend, but I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt stop her from hanging out with him if he never turns her down. \n\nThe only reason he turned her down this Friday was because he was doing a quick workout and wanted to get home for a game release, it wasn‚Äôt even because of respect for me. \n\nHe said I‚Äôm being controlling but agreed that if she asks to workout with him that he‚Äôd tell her he‚Äôd only workout with her in groups and not 1 on 1. But he said he wouldn‚Äôt tell her unless she asks again. \n\nI really just want him to unadd her on snap and set boundaries in place NOW, not just wait for her to ask. But I know I‚Äôm overly jealous.\n\nI asked if he found her more attractive but he said I‚Äôm not allowed to ask those question because my therapist told me not to. But I feel like the fact he‚Äôs so adamant on not responding means he does find her prettier than me, and body wise too. He told me even if he did it wouldn‚Äôt matter because he loves me and wouldn‚Äôt do anything and is allowed to have friends. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice on how to handle this situation? Is what we set in place fair or should he cut contact? \n\nTLDR; Female coworker I was suspicious",

        "text": "So I know this is solely a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem I guess but navigating it and coping with it would be helpful so I‚Äôm looking for advice about that \n\nSo I (22 f) have been with my boyfriend (23 m) for a few months now. I love him very much and we were friends before we began to date so our relationship feels pretty good cause we didn‚Äôt have that awkward ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt really know each other‚Äù stage\n\nSo my boyfriend and I are pretty similar and we love going to concerts! Like small shows mostly that only cost $20-$40 per ticket. My boyfriend has been to over 100 shows and it‚Äôs like his hobby and slowly it has become mine. I was in a long term relationship half a year ago and stopped going to shows and my current partner helped me find that part of myself again\n\nBut one thing that‚Äôs hard is money. My boyfriend makes significantly more than I do. I‚Äôm a recent college grad and work part time in retail. The hours have been so bad cause of the season and I barely get put on 2 days a week and the most hours I get per shift are no more than 5 1/2. So I‚Äôm sure you can imagine my minuscule paychecks\n\nIt‚Äôs been hard finding a full time job in my degree and my laptop crapped out so this month I‚Äôm going to try and find another retail job that can give me more hours. But because of my financial situation, it‚Äôs hard for me to do things date wise within my relationship and my boyfriend and I have a very ‚Äúone person doesn‚Äôt pay for everything‚Äù mentality\n\nThere‚Äôs a concert this Saturday, and like usual, I can‚Äôt afford it. My boyfriend is going without me and I‚Äôm feeling some triggers pop up about how I feel he should buy me a ticket, etc. And I know rationally I am not entitled to ANYONE‚ÄôS money. And in my previous relationship, I was used to being paid for because that was the dynamic we had and I guess I just feel this weird entitlement brewing in me. \n\nAnd I also like receiving gifts and things as a love language so I guess a part of me feels sad in a way he doesn‚Äôt seem that bothered I‚Äôm not coming cause he won‚Äôt buy me a ticket. And I know in my rational mind that‚Äôs super entitled and childish to think but I don‚Äôt know how to knock it off! I‚Äôm trying to see the positives of spending a Saturday night alone but I feel like all I‚Äôll think about is not going which sounds depressing \n\nI just would love some advice on how to cope with differing income gaps and feeling inadequate cause I can‚Äôt go to events like he can. And how i can cope with ‚Äúabandonment‚Äù feelings when he goes to events without me. This concert is just a minor example of a series of situations that have come up decently in our time together so far that follow the same kind of pattern \n\nI don‚Äôt want my triggers to cause me to get upset and lash out. like I know rationally my lack of money is no one else‚Äôs problem and I am looking for a new position asap but for the moment, I just feel lost on how to navigate all these feelings!\n\nTL;dr: income gap between my boyfriend and I makes me feel sad I can‚Äôt go to events with him or do as many things because I‚Äôm always so broke. I‚Äôm working on trying to find a new job but would love some insight on how to deal with trigger feelings when it comes to money",

He was seeing me after dates with her. \n\nI met up with him and I asked why not dump me? He said that her family has a lot of money. She pays for their dates. I was grossed out, he may have been sleeping with us both the same day. I would want to know. \n\nI messaged the girl and her family to let them know what was going on. The family was pissed. I met up with the family in person. I gave them my phone and said I don‚Äôt care about my privacy go through it (I had nude pics of me in our messages, none of him). I showed the chat log was from his number and gave free reign. Also let them go through our Facebook messenger account. \n\nThe company the guy I was seeing worked for was owned by the girlfriends brother. He said he was his best friend of over the years and he got him a job and repaid him by cheating on his little sister‚Ä¶ ON THE CLOCK. The messages proved he was fucking me in the work truck so the guy was paying him to cheat on the sister. \n\nThe girl was mad at me for blowing up his spot. She said I am lying and she will prove his innocence. She chose to stay with him. The family thanked me, but it left me confused. \n\nThe guy messaged me asking me to lie. He said he will go to the police for defamation and harassment and I will get a record unless I lie. He said he will ruin my life like I ruined his. I refused to lie. \n\nThe other day I made a new tinder account. I saw him and super liked it we matched. This is a new account. He‚Äôs still with her. \n\nShe‚Äôs 25 and never had a bf and is extremely introverted. \n\nShould I tell the family? Why match with me? Why not just sleep with the girlfriend?\n\nTL;DR: guy I was seeing had a gf. I told her and her entire family he was cheating on her sexually five times a week and proved it. She decided to stay with him. I just matched with him on tinder. It‚Äôs been a month and the family wants me to tell them info. What do I do?",

I explained how i felt but she wasn‚Äôt listening so i stopped speaking with her until she apologised. \n\nFour days later I‚Äôm still ill and she asked to talk in person and ended things. She claims it‚Äôs been on her mind for months. Her explanation ranges from our values not aligning to I‚Äôm manipulative/controlling and I even don‚Äôt push her hard enough which left me much more confused. \n\nI'm unemployed(interviewing with no luck) which I believe contributed to her decision, but she insists she just wants to focus on herself. I don‚Äôt buy it.\n\nThe last few years have been great for us, we‚Äôre achieving our goals, we‚Äôre traveling a lot and we ended up living together most of last year. We understand each other pretty well (I thought), we never argue while we‚Äôre together and she always tells me how happy she is with me(most recently being 4 days ago)\n\nHowever sometimes she can be easily swayed so I wonder if the therapist advised her to break up with me? It makes sense to me because her therapist recently diagnosed her with loads of harmful character traits(which i disagree with) and maybe he identified me as the problem? I‚Äôve been with her for 7 years so I asked if she‚Äôs bored of me, she said no and she still loves me but her mind is made. We almost broke up 3x in the past but we always worked things out and became stronger. This time nobody got hurt and it‚Äôs caught me off guard\n\nTLDR girlfriend breaks up with me after taking weeks of therapy sessions. We never argue, she always tells me she is happiest with me.",

Last night at the dinner table there was a big box literally on the table where I sit and he wouldn‚Äôt move it. Said no it‚Äôs to heavy. Here‚Äôs where I get tripped up in my head‚Ä¶..I WOULDVE MOVED THE BOX FOR HIM. He won‚Äôt do the same things I will and it bothers me. I would move mountains for him and he can‚Äôt even move a box. Sigh I really just feel like he dislikes me. This morning I said to his son, ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù and was going to sit with him while I drank my coffee and he called me into the kitchen and told me not to speak to the child that I will distract him from eating. Which I had no intention of doing. I just wanted to sit with him. I let it go but if the shoe were on the other foot and he cared enough to sit with my child and speak to them I would be elated and just let it happen. I wouldn‚Äôt care. Sometimes I just feel like he doesn‚Äôt want me around honestly. And he takes advantage of my doting nature. He knows I would go get the moon if he asked and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the problem. But I don‚Äôt know how to be any other way. If I don‚Äôt then he won‚Äôt and that‚Äôll be that, and we won‚Äôt see each other, etc. I work two jobs and he has a repair business from home. I feel like he has more available time and more flexibility than I but yet he‚Äôs always ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. I find it hard to believe. I don‚Äôt even call him. He calls me between 8-9 nightly unless we are together. I don‚Äôt call him because in the beginning I called and I could tell he was anxious to get off of the phone or he would cut it short and that hurt my feelings. Like I haven‚Äôt even spoken to you all day, and you‚Äôre not happy to talk to me, or willing to take a moment to speak to me. So I don‚Äôt even call which is pretty shitty because who wants to feel like they can‚Äôt call their significant other. But it‚Äôs truly like that I would rather protect myself, then put myself in a position to where he could hurt my feelings, so I don‚Äôt even call at all. He said in the beginning it seems as if you call me on your way home from work. I‚Äôll make a better effort to answer the phone. So I tried once or twice more and he didn‚Äôt make the effort so I was like forget it I‚Äôm not even gonna call ever he literally has zero incoming calls from me in the last six months like who wouldn‚Äôt want to see their persons name on their phone it‚Äôs so fucking weird he‚Äôs not even bothered. Also, he had these blue notification dots on his phone. We were on a 10 day vacation. I looked it up and I‚Äôm pretty sure it takes the place of the app notification. So essentially you can hide a notification from an app. It‚Äôs a note phone that he has, I have not seen the blue notifications since our vacation. I wonder am I correct in my understanding of what those are. The blue dot notifications. They look like squares. Perhaps he is hiding something.",

        "text": "We have been together for 3 years and we have been long distance on and off for about 1 1/2. He will be finishing school in 6 months. \n\nOver the last few years I've floated the idea of moving out together and he always said he was afraid of sharing finances. I was fine with this because he is in school and being younger at the time I assumed that he'd come around to the idea. I also live with a roommate so I wasn't in a rush.\n\nA few months ago, we discussed moving out seriously and he was on board. The unanimous plan was 1 year after he graduates to give him time to save up and for us to find a place. \n\nRecently he shared with me that he doesn't want to go through with the plan because it's scary and it will complicate our relationship and that he doesn't know what he wants and he was unclear when I asked him to explain. He also mentioned that he never did the math on how long we'd be together at this point.\n\nI feel confused because he always expresses how much he loves me and we stay at eachothers apartments for weeks at a time when we visit each other.\n\nI am at a loss because the timeline puts us at 5 years together and being afraid to complicate the relationship when we've been together for that long is kind of ridiculous. I don't know how to approach this conversation in a way that isn't relationship ending because I still hold out hope that he'll come around once he's out of school. I want to be together but I feel like I'm putting everything on hold in hopes that he'll change his mind. I can't really see myself with anyone else and it feels insensitive for me to feel the way I do.\n\nTldr; boyfriend doesn't want to move out for fear of complicating our 5 year relationship. I'm confused.",

This is about the 13 year old. My mother claims we were close growing up but as i grew older i do not like her at all. I know that sounds bad but i seriously cant see myself having a relationship with her. This is mainly because she‚Äôs a pathological liar, a thief and some other things i know i shouldn‚Äôt say about my ‚Äúsister‚Äù.\n\n  She always stills my clothes, jewelry, etc. And then lies about it when confronted. I told my mother, she‚Äôll have a talk with her and then she would end up doing it again. And it‚Äôs unfortunately starting to make me hate her really bad. I‚Äôve had talks with her and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where i have to hide all of my things (we share a room). I‚Äôm not at all innocent, i‚Äôve said some horrible things to get out of frustration which i know is wrong but i cannot stand her anymore. and i would rather not have a relationship with her.\n\nSo how do i go about this, how do i make her stop and understand? Leave any questions and i‚Äôll answer. Thank you.\n\nTLDR: Sister keeps taking my things. and i am 100% sure i hate her and feel nothing towards her. How do i go about this?\n\n(sorry for poor formatting)",

        "text": "My friend(22F) has always had an easy time getting bfs. She's very kind and easy to get along with so people gravitate toward her. The problem is she has never held a long term relationship, has never reached the 1 year anniversary with anyone. She either loses interest (boredom?) or has some other reason for breaking up.\n\nRecently she(let's call her Jane) had a bf(24M) that she seemed very committed to. We will call him Liam. Jane met Liam overseas, as they were both stationed together at a military base, and eventually started dating. Because Jane was overseas for several years, she didn't see her family very often and this fact seemed to damage her mental health. She tried to get early leave but the military did not allow it, so she was stuck there except for Christmases when she would come home for the holidays.\n\nShe had been dating Liam for about a year when the military reassigned him to a different base in another country. They tried to make long distance work but he stopped zoom chatting with her as often and it fizzled out. She was pretty broken up about this relationship ending.\n\nSkip forward less than 6 months after hearing about their breakup and I'm finding out that Jane rebounded with someone(20M). Let's call him Trevor. Not only did she rebound quickly, but when I found out about the relationship they were already MARRIED. M A R R I E D. AFTER ONLY A FEW MONTHS OF DATING!\n\nShe's apparently been friends with Trevor for a year(he was stationed with her and Liam). Not only this but, she and Trevor were both reassigned and he is going to a different country than she is. She returned to the USA and spent time with her family but then she surprised everyone by getting married to this new bf OVER ZOOM CALL. Her bf was home with his parents and she was driving to her new military base with her dad when they had their \"wedding ceremony\" over zoom call.\n\nAnother red flag: she wasn't even going to tell her family about the ceremony, originally. Jane told her parents about the online scheduled ceremony only a few days or so beforehand. And her older sister was notified too and \"attended\". Her other siblings and their SOs found out secondhand, after the ceremony, via text from her dad.(this happened a month or so ago) I'm only just finding out about all of this via \"the grapevine\".\n\nThis whole situation seems like a huge red flag to me and many others who are aware of the situation. Why hide the marriage plans until the last minute from family? Why rush into marriage with someone you just started seeing, who won't even be in the same country as you?! I don't know how to approach talking to her about my concerns. Please help!\n\n**TL;DR;**: Jane married Trevor over zoom and wasn't going to tell her parents initially. They are stationed in different countries and have only dated less than 6 months. I'm concerned for her.",

I've been trying my absolute best to try and make her feel like she can trust me and continue the relationship flower, chocolate, love letters, overall nice things she on the other hand has not made any effort to rebuild trust and everything I ask her to take her password off she says I'm not talking to him I have nothing to hide I'll take the password off when I'm ready I don't like how involved you want to be in my life rightnow (she's a commitment phobe from traumatic childhood even if she dosnt admit it) but for the past almost two years before this happened she was fine with letting me have access to her phone. Is there anything I can say or do to help her make the first step into letting her guard down again and removing the password (she's not a bad human she hasn't cheated and I fricken love her to bits) I'm doing everything I can to make this relationship work but I need her to put in some damn effort or it's going to tear me apart and destroy me.\n\nWe broke each other's trust now she won't take the password off her phone\nTLDR",

        "text": "Life story incoming I'll use bullet points and be as brief as possible when appropriate. \n\nMother married prior to me being born. \nHad a daughter, cheated on said 1st husband with let's call him BJ. \nDivorce went through the daughter and chose her father over her mother I believe I've been told. Mum signed everything away: the house the business.\nMum met my biological father, got pregnant then left him raised me alone up until I was 6 and she met the man who later adopted me let's call him T. \nChildhood was relatively okay I didn't want for nothing I had shelter, food and water. \n\n(AGE: 4-6) A few memories from childhood she taught me swimming on holiday in Turkey, I don't remember but I am told about it. \n\n(Age: 8 ish) She became a child minder for a period of time and did lots of out going activities with them but never with me because cost so I used to sit waiting for my mate across the street to come home.\n\n(Age: 10) In primary school I took magazines into school, quite a few but what's the harm. She rang the school and had the teacher pull them out all Infront of my class to embarss me, her concern was my back... Weird. \nParents were both constantly at work so TV pretty much raised me. \n\n(Age: 11) My cousin had this rota on his fridge in which he would do chores and earn money, I put forward the idea to my mum and was shot down. I did get ¬£5 spending money a week very in freuquently but she made me ashamed to ask. \n\n(Age: 11-16) I spent time with I wouldnt say rich kids but there parents werent as tight with money so I could only share in some experiences but not a majority which made me feel left out alot, even though I was told by mother I had it good. Yes food shelter water, the types of things you generally provide for when you choose to have a kid. \n\n(Age: 14) I once sprained my leg on a field and had to borrow crutches from the neighbours and she wouldn't take me to A and E because we'll time it would take being at A and E. \n\n(Age: 15) I came out as gay and she broke down crying and then was super okay with it for ages until she rang me one day and was like I accept you. She certainly made my coming out all about her when in fact it should of been nothing but at the least be about me but no it was how it affected her. \n\n(Age: 15+) My teenager years all I remember is being angry with her, she suffocated me and I couldnt wait to leave for university to get away from her. She made me feel like a nugunt she always went against the grain of those of my peers parents. She was very picky in the house hold there basically couldn't be any existence of me other than my room. \n\n(Age: All my life) She's always said I've done my best for you but I honestly couldn't care. \nShe loves to use when I'm dead you'll miss me, I might but that comment now has no effect I'm now 28 and hasn't for a while. Always with guilt trips and negative reinforcement growing up never positive. \n\n(Age:16-18) Anyways the run up to university she wasn't constantly moody made the house feel very uncomfortable always saying when I leave for university she's going to have her own life. \nDuring college I was told that I was not allowed to have any new \"people\" around the house only those from secondary school, I was quite introvert and had very little financial support so I couldnt consolidate friendships with new friends. As we all know everyone goes their own ways and I had less friendships. \n\n(Age: 18) I left for university, on the day of dropping me off for university she again cried and made it a miserable moment rather than a joyous one for her son. Three months later my dad left my mum. My mum begged me to come back home, she was crying in the kitchen in front of my dad begging me. So I did. 6 months down the line we have to move house because the family house is sold. After moving into another property a further 6 months down the line we argue and she throws the fact that she only got a two bedroom property because of me... This is not long after begging me to move in. Any friends I had from college had again gone their own ways, different cities, countries. I found that because I didn't follow the conventional route I didn't make any new friends at my short time at university nor has any friends to fall back on when I returned for my mother. \n\n(Age: 19) Anyways I go back to university to restart but unfortunately I ended up seeing someone die in difficult circumstances that fucked my head up thus my opportunity at university. I did leave again during this time remained at the city I studied in before moving back in 12 months later back in with Mother. \n\n(Age: 21) Few months after this my ex boyfriend moved in with us, he used to hit and hit me until one day I couldnt take it no more and hit back, my mum saw all of this yet played the mutual and not picking sides. \nOne night while my ex partner was out I got drunk and lost my temper and threw a remote (it wasn't working) at the wall but hit a mirror, she called the police because she had enough of all the aggro in the house, should of heard her on the phone playing victim. She never thought for maybe a second that my reaction to remote was probably over the top because I was getting twatted every weekend and I felt trapped and unsupported in what was supposed to be my home.  \n\nI left one night and ended up in a house share, left my ex and then met someone who went to my secondary school and we started dating, he's actually in bed with me right now ( I am very lucky ). \n\nLet me try and get more to the point RECENTLY I've been coming to terms with what has happened in the past, there are more incidents of her being a self centered individual and I just don't have any strong desire to have a relationship with her. It is so forced I can and have gone weeks without contacting her she has and always gets around me by speaking to my partners and making plans to come to my house in this instance. \nI've text my mum and T about how I felt during their break up when I was 18 years old. The reply from T was okay let's talk about it, my mother's was disgusting she said that she is ashamed of me and she disowns me. Anyways she's spoke to my boyfriend and now she's coming Saturday we haven't spoken since the text messages of her disowning me. \n\nI feel I have alot of anger directed towards her, atleast with T I've had time away from him and somewhat punished him with my absence I suppose although he is a good dad as is my mother however I just can't seem to scratch this feelings with my mum. I think she's very all about me, she over steps into my personal life, I don't text my partners mum and the only reason she is texting mine is because I don't text her. \n\nI don't know what to do with the situation nor how to deal with these feelings, I just want some time away from her like I wanted when I went to university. \n\nAny questions are welcomed I'm probably not sleeping tonight, thank you for taking the time to an aspect of my life.\n\nTLDR; I have a collection of stories that will give you an inclination of my bringing up, I felt I was gas lighted and certain things and just not very supported. Need external opinions.",

        "text": "TL:DR My wife and I learned that she is much better at fighting and now feels uncomfortable going out in case anything happens. \n\nMy wife and I have been together for 10 years, married for 7. We are doing great and I would not want to be with anyone else. I'll just get right into it... we were goofing around the other night and started play wrestling, we really never did that before and I was surprised that she was giving me a hard time. For context, I am 6'5 and sort of skinny-fat but I work out. She is 5'4 and petite but fit. She was a college athlete and keeps up a solid workout regimen.\n\nShe thought I was holding back and then realized that I wasn't to both of our surprise. We moved some furniture and went at it again and she said we should try to be competitive but careful. I was trying all out and she kept dominating me, what is more is that even though I knew she wasn't going to try and hurt me, my subconscious KNEW I was outmatched and wanted to get away from her! It was instinctive. I just knew that if she were serious, I'd easily get my ass kicked and she probably wouldn't break a sweat! I don't know how to explain it except that I felt helpless and frustrated and everything I tried, she was ready for. We finished as a teacher/student kinda thing were I'd try a move, she'd counter and it and show me what I did wrong, that's when we both realized she was way better at this.\n\nFor some reason this ended up being a turn on for us both at first and we had intense sex. We talked later and she said that she learned to fight from her brother and had some anger issues when she was younger that she wanted to forget so she didn't talk much about it and said she should have but didn't want me to think less of her since I knew her as a different person.\n\nFor me... I was always shy, never looked for trouble and was tall enough that people just never saw me as a potential victim I guess. I made it through adult life and was never in a fight in my life (she was in several) and I guess my male pride just told me I could handle myself.\n\nLife is funny in that it was my WIFE who let me know that I guess I can't.\n\nI said things seem weird because she seems to act differently. She keeps bringing up this incident from a few years back when we got caught in a road rage situation after a fender bender and we thought this guy would get physical with us but the cops came first. It shook us both up but, I think she just assumed that I'd be better able to defend myself and her and now she realizes it would have been up to her. I mean, I would have done my best of course but realistically we both know she would be more effective.\n\nShe's bought pepper spray and has been mentioning that I should take a self defense course. We both go into the city alot and there has been more crime and more aggressive homeless. She said she doesn't feel comfortable if anything happens and it's \"all on her\" as she said.\n\nThe thing is, neither of us were aware of this a week ago. She assumed I was roughly her equal or better at defending myself and my male pride and lack of conflict led me to believe the same. My job is crazy right now and I may get laid off... I really can't focus on taking time to learn skills I've never developed or really needed and realistically this is something that does not just happen overnight.\n\nShe seems to want to go out less during our date nights. Hope this passes but I don't know what to do if it doesn't.\n\nI mean.. what do couples do if the guy ends up with a medical condition and obviously can't defend himself..do THEY just not go out and the wife feels put upon that it's \"all on her\"? I'm trying to be supportive but it just feels weird and makes me feel like crap",

        "text": "TL;DR mom refuses to let go of a situation that happened 3 months ago.\n\nSo my mom (55), my fianc√©e (31 M) and I (29 F) had a\nmishap a few months ago at a restaurant that resulted in\nme crying, my fianc√©e telling her she was out of line, and her\nbeing mad at everyone. My fianc√©e and I got up and left the\nrestaurant and things were very slow to heal afterward. My mom and l went to therapy and were discharged after a few sessions but she still insists that my fianc√©e was in the wrong for telling her she was out of line.\n\nShe said today that she's still mad about it and will not be\ncivil to him until she receives an apology from him. I told her that she created the situation in the restaurant and was in the wrong for doing it but she insists she's the one who was\nwronged in all of it.\n\nIt tears me apart seeing 2 people that I care about not being\ncivil and creates unnecessary drama. I want to leave the\npast behind but it just won't stay buried. Do I just have to live\ncaught between this? Or is there actually something I can do\nthat will fix this?",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have already been living together for a few months already in a different state but my parents do not know about this. However, I have to move back in closer to home due to a job and will be staying in my grandparents old condo that my mom now owns. We would be paying my mom rent. However, my parents are against living together until we get married. I am worried as well that my mom will say that it seems that our relationship is moving quick even though we have known each other for 3 years. I just think it would be more convenient for me for us to live and my grandparents old house, however because of this I feel that my mom will state that it is her house her rules even though she will not be living there. My boyfriend would rather stay at the condo too versus getting our own apartment due to cheaper rent because he still has to pay the mortgage for his house even though he is moving with me. This has been causing a lot of strain in our relationship because he says that I am a grown adult I can do as I please, but it is not exactly like that when my mom is the landlord.  I am not sure how to convince my parents, my dad is pretty religious which is why I think that he doesn't believe in living together before marriage. Not sure my moms reasoning, but my parents did not live together until they got married. It is too expensive these days to live without your so or a roommate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**: My parents are against my boyfriends and I living together, but we will need to because of moving and housing expenses.",
