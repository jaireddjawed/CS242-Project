        "text": "Talking about Blade Runner 2049, I would like to start with the good. K's arc was quite nice, from replicant to supposedly human and back to...and there it get's interesting. The film again raises the question, what exactly makes us human, and the film heavily implies that it's our thinking. As soon as K thinks that he is born (the differentiator between replicant and human, procreation) he suddenly 'feels' the rain and changes in his actions, he starts to have what one might consider as will. As soon as it gets revealed that he is a replicant after all, he realizes that nothing has changed, he still feels the snowflakes on his hand and he decides not to kill Deckard. So is it only the 'believe' that we are human, that makes us human? Certainly not. K's hologram sweetheart 'Joi' shows, that apart from, let's call it 'mentality', a certain physicality in form of a body is required. This is the main reason for the threesome scene. \n\nAt this point I wonder, why being 'born' instead of 'made' is they key difference between being human (real) and replicant (unreal). For the plot it is obvious, if there are born replicants this would mean that they would be their own master and thus would revolt. However, If we can replicate human beings to such a detailed degree, then why should the replicants not be able to reproduce? I'm not buying that replicants can only be detected through special tests but lack one of the most basic human abilities. But then, without any decent reason, an even outdated replicant, Rachel, was able to reproduce. Now I imagine the writers of the film like this: 'hmm fuck, but this doesn't make any sense....Ahh, easy fix. Let's call it a MIRACLE! People will buy it np.'\n\nNow the film decays into a mess of clichés of a highkicking 'DADDY, LOOK! I'M THE BEST' replicant, the short haired on the surface tough but inside good LAPD boss, and Deckard. Oh lord, bringing back Deckard .This is so bad I was about to laugh.\n\nSo all in all I give the film a 6.5/10 for great ambitions, eye candy and some interesting points. If some of you might give me recommendations on the topic 'what is human', I would appreciate that.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean that Deckard is K's father.",

        "text": "**Though this text does cover a few Gosling films, only the *Blade Runner 2049* and *Drive* coverage has spoilers.**\n\nThe character of K (Ryan Gosling) in *Blade Runner 2049* shares some similarities with other roles Ryan Gosling has had, whether that be viz. his character archetypes or something that happens to that character. The most obvious parallel is *Drive*. Not only does Gosling play a stoic, stolid hero (in Los Angeles), but he also gets stabbed in the stomach in the end. There are two other similarities I found, though much more subtle. The first was that K has a not-a-real-person girlfriend, Joi (Ana De Armas), similar to how Lars has Bianca in *Lars And The Real Girl.* Then, there's the reference to Sebastian in *La La Land*, a film Ryan is fresh off of an Oscar nomination from and one that audiences were going to have in mind when they saw Gosling in *2049*. Returning to a house, K plays a few piano keys. \n\nWhat do you take from these similarities? Did the writers have Ryan in mind when writing the screenplay, and was there any intent behind it? Going further, were any of these similarities commentaries or even critiques of Gosling's characters of old? Personally, at the very most the piano playing was an homage, but, perhaps, the *Drive*-esque ending was a critique, especially since *2049* ended the opposite, with K supposedly dying from the stab wound instead of driving away heroically from it. This ending is definitely [more realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WfzDJ0RHHM), and it could criticize *Drive* as less matter, more art. One can argue *2049* has more matter, especially viz. run time.\n\nTo conclude, just food for thought: did Joi call K \"Joe\" because we find out that he isn't special and is, in turn, just an \"average Joe\"?",

        "text": "I just got around to watch Mean Streets today and I found it to be pretty good, although a bit underwhelming from the expectations that were set to me by Taxi Driver. I also noticed that there wasn't a single post discussing this movie on this subreddit so I thought I'd make one!\n\nWhat I loved about it was how it incorporated Christian morals with the main character of Charlie player by Harvey Keitel. Out of all the characters, Charlie seems to be the only one concerned with the morality of his actions and the eventual consequences of them , not only on this earth but also in the afterlife even though he is the least violent one and least sinful from what we're shown. In contrast, De Niro's character Johnny boy who lives off loans and ripping people off and yet has no concern for his actions and their consequences. But it seems to me that Charlie himself might already have given up himself, or is at least prepared to because throughout the movie we see him try his hand(literally) on fire to see if he will *\"endure\"* hell.\n\nNow it is apparent that Scorsese's work is heavily based on his beliefs and those things that he holds dear, and that might sound obvious but a lot of people think that we should separate the art from the artist but I believe there is a bit of every artist in most art, and this movie seems to have *A LOT* of Scorsese in it, it's basically his view of the world that he grew up in, and everything from the neighbourhood, people and morals reflects that. \n\nI'm still confused about the depiction of Black people in his old films, depictions that in Taxi Driver were at least a bit relevant, serves no purpose here... I doubt it is his own views, he seems like the nicest guy ever from what I've seen but obviously I don't know him. Is it purely how he saw his own communities view on black people? And is not portraying it the same as being dishonest about how he grew up or do you think it just doesn't serve any purpose? And what do you think he's trying to say with the ending? He goes back and forth between the peacefulness of Charlie's Uncles living room and the chaos and aftermath of the shootout that happens(Not to mention that Charlie gets to see the black prostitute in a peaceful state in a restaurant while he gets dragged down to an ambulance). For a film that \"heavily\" focuses on sins and their consequences, there isn't a lot here. Yes, Johnny boy gets to pay but it felt like it was a consequence of being stupid and not because of he did something morally wrong. In the end it just kind of feels like it doesn't get anywhere... \n\nI'm sorry if this all sounds nonsensical, I just find it hard to separate reality and fiction in Scorsese's older films because it feels like he is trying to say something which each aspect of his films and since this movie hasn't been discussed here I just mentioned a bit of everything so the post lacks focus.

Once again, quite like many of his other masterpieces, Hitchcock attempts and succeeds in exposing the \"chaos at the fringe of ordinary experience\" (Spoto, Chapter 6, Para 2). As Spoto points out, the idea of a terrorist attack may seem fantastical at the time the film was made, but today Sabotage has the \"alarming look of a documentary film\" (Spoto, Chapter 6, Para 1). Perhaps Hitchcock attempted to foreshadow the events that Europe was to witness in the years to come.

        "text": "My film club recently covered Vampyr on my channel: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7uMWxg913c&amp;t=713s\n\nPlease watch the video, I am actually pretty proud of the points we make during it.\n\nHere's an essay I wrote as well to maybe get a good conversation going if you don't intend to watch the video analysis (which I would certainly recommend over reading my essay, since I wrote the following years ago and the more recent video is better representative of my current feelings about Dreyer's masterwork in experimental subjectivity):\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer's greatest weapon is also his only weakness. It is the color white.\n\nWhite is associated with purity and perfection. It is the color of virginity. The films of Carl Theodor Dreyer are about deflowering the most innocent of colors. Vampyr is film about its rape. It is about abusing something pure. The wholeness of the color white is ripped apart by Dreyer. Vampyr is a film that burns. While most horror films scare you from the shadows, Dreyer basks his in impossibly bright lights. The whiteness adds a mesmerizing quality to a film that is already incredibly dreamlike. Dreyer's stylistic glow gives Vampy a spooky luminescence. It gives it depth. It gives it meaning.\n\nThe psychology of the color white is based on the idea that it is representative of a blank canvas. This is a definition that implies an unseen other: the painter. White is a reflective color, therefore there must be something that is either being reflected off of it or onto it. White is about fairness and impartiality, while the unseen other is free of such burdens. In the case of Vampyr, Dreyer is the unseen other, and this other is demonic. He seeks to torture his canvas with nightmares. He aims to defile it.\n\nWhitness is one of Dreyer's signature strokes. He used the power of light consistently throughout his career. In fact, Dreyer's filmography can be measured by a sundial. His films depend on the color white. This is a very tricky platform that Dreyer has raised. His films require intense lights. Expressionistic light is essential to the structural integrity of them. Once Dreyer gives his whiteness to a film, he can't take it away without it falling apart. So, he doesn't. He leaves it there and he gives them more. He gives his films sunburns. The first step Dreyer took towards deflowering the color white was to expose it intimately to itself, without a filter and without cosmetic protection. White consumed itself. Dreyer controlled the blaze, feeding the flames with brilliant images and a disjointed serenity.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've gone over color theory in such great detail in one of my reviews. It's a reoccurring theme in my writing. It's a filmmaking tool that intensely interests me and it's something I can immediately identify with. Dreyer's use of color is singular in spectrum but dynamic in execution. Every possible aspect of white is something communicated by Dreyer. He knew how to conjure its innocence, photograph its wholeness, capture its coldness, and harness its reflective nature into something mechanical that he could operate. He could do this all in one clean masterstroke. The only weakness one could find in his application of light is the fact that his films live or die on the technique's total efficiency. If the whiteness fails to obtain symbolic meanings, then his films would be symbolically meaningless. If the light fails to shine, then Dreyer's films would be eternally blind. However, with Vampyr, this is not the case at all. Vampyr may be Dreyer at his most masterful. It is certainly the best implementation of his whiteness. It is a film that carries the complexities of light. It is a film that smolders.\n\nThe color white is a difficult one to control. Vampyr is one of the most effortlessly atmospheric films of all time. It sucks you in. It absorbs you. It is Carmilla given third degree burns. Even the immaculately choreographed shadow dance is dependent on literal visibility. By becoming a master of light, Dreyer would also conquer darkness by method of contrast. It all relies on the blank canvas of the color white. Every scene of Dreyer's is first whitewashed and then symbolically occupied. Dreyer's films were certainly emblematic but at their most basic core, they were about illumination. Through light comes revelation, something that Dreyer could manipulate into behaving in emotional, symbolic, and narrative fashions. Light was his secret weapon. Without its constant use, Dreyer would be artistically penniless.\n\nProbably the most important thing about Vampyr is whether or not it's scary. I hope the reader will take my nightmares as proof enough of its capacity to terrify. Dreyer's film is the most haunting one I have ever witnessed. It's because of the light, not because of the dark. I've never had such bright nightmares. It is a radiant kind of fear.\n\nVampyr is a supreme masterwork. If one aspect of it not had not been executed exactly right, the entire film would have collapsed upon itself. Dreyer's direction was perfect, all the way down to the tiniest detail and the most minute facet. Vampyr is the most delicate masterpiece in the world. I'm almost afraid to touch it because it seems so unstable. I have never seen a more fragile film.\n\nBe careful with this one. Treat it cautiously. Remember how delicate it is. Remember the white.\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel or engage with me here. I always enjoy meeting new film lovers. ",

Both these movies are stellar and deeply affecting in their own way. They deal with desires deep and dark hidden inside the human psyche.While Seven starts off being both who and why dunnit, it gradually becomes whodunnit and then before the end of act 2 it answers that question as well. In Silence of the Lambs, they know the name of the killer but do not know who he really is and what are his reasons to do what he does. Seven plays like a buddy love for Mills and Somerset, hints of which can be seen in Clarice and Lecter. Both these films also play like a quest. For Clarice the film can also be seen as a coming of age story. But somehow, to me, Seven proves to be so much more disturbing and deeply unsettling. In the following paper I would like to break down these two pathbreaking thrillers and evaluate them inside the parameters of theme and character to bring out my reasons for the above mentioned conclusion.",

I posted about \"Little England\" the other day and i watched another great film called \"Miss Violence\" as someone else suggested.\n\n**Official Synopsis:**\n\n*It's Angeliki's 11th birthday celebration, and a well-organised party is held in her honour. Everything is in order, and all the ingredients of a usual birthday party are there. A nice fest, a big cake, music, dance, a caring grandfather's embrace... a truly loving family environment. But is it real, or is this an elaborate facade? As we witness a devastating act of despair, we understand that something lies underneath. The story advances, and we slowly get lured into a web of hideous secrets, while gradually getting ourselves dragged into a downward spiral of lies and deceptive appearances. When we unwillingly unravel the mysteries kept behind closed doors, in reality, we plunge into the depths of the human soul and the unfathomable secrets within.*\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe movie begins with the suicide of a young girl on a simmingly senseless moment. As we are trying to realize why it happend, the movie starts to slowly reveal the dark secrets of her disfunctional family. The movie is focusing on her 2 grandparents, her mother and her 3 siblings. All of them live under the same roof.\n\nThe movie is realistic, mostly filmed on a typical old Greek apartment. The acting is dark and depressing. There is no comedy involved and there are many shocking moments. \n\n\n\n**Do not watch this film with your kids or with your date.**\n\n**If you are a Lanthimos fan(especially Dogtooth), you will love this film.** Just don't expect any dark comedy.\n\n[Imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3078242/?ref_=ttawd_awd_tt)\n\n[trailer](https://youtu.be/rZ63JuWkSh4)",

        "text": "Jeremy Renner, AKA white Jaden Smith, starred in one of the years “most underrated” movies even though it opened in 2,890 theaters, including the local theater in the small-town middle of nowhere local Minnesotan theatre I saw it in, and grossed 33 million dollars, making back 3 times its budget. \n\n.\n\nThese performances were one-note, White Jaden Smith was looking at something far away the whole movie, and Elizabeth Olsen was quirkily out of her element. There was no variation in performance, partially because there was no progression of character, but also because these actors think their million dollar names and sheer star power will carry them through this dry bone of a script. There was nothing special, nothing sacrificed, there was no spark in these actors. They were just running through the motions again and again and again. They didn’t dive into this shallow script and so their performances are kiddie pool in depth and complexity. These were empty husks of actors inhabiting lifeless characters giving the audience shallow performances. \n\n.\n\nWhen photographing a derelict, dry, and lifeless environment it can be difficult to not make said photography derelict, dry, and lifeless. Wind River’s cinematography is shakey nauseating nonsense that does not inform or compliment the movie as a whole. Almost everything in this film seems accidental. Because the director is a more talented screenwriter, the direction suffers immensely. It seems like each department was segmented, restricted from communicating with each other about the goals of the film and what the director wanted. Maybe that was from a literal lack of communication, or maybe it was this inexperienced director not knowing how to translate page to screen. Some of the wide shots and drone shots were visually interesting and thoughtfully composed, but nearly every single other shot in the film is shaky handheld nonsense! Much of this film has the flair of a cable drama. Point-of-view shots when one of the leads gets sprayed with an eye irritant is one of a handful of visual missteps. It’s not fair to expect the pristine slickness of Denis Villeneuve or the rugged momentum of David Mackenzie, but as a first outing, there’s a visual rhythm missing here. Wind River falls in line with those gritty, pseudo old-fashioned American thrillers this director scripted, but lacks the directorial flare to take the true story to the next level. Nothing in this film discussed or explored the themes of the screenplay, except the screenplay. Nothing was special. It was just checkboxes. \n\n.\n\nFor a film lauded for exploring the mistreatment of indigenous people by US law enforcement, this film was thematically flimsy. This is by all means a pro-cop film. For police who shoot unarmed citizens, fear has been essential to their legal defense, it is vital that those police convince a judge or jury that their fear of an unarmed black man is authentic, even though those citizens were UNARMED and not dangerous. There’s a major power imbalance that is perpetuated by films like these that show the police in a heroic light. There’s a scene in this film that shows an FBI agent shooting an armed Native American man. Within the logic of the film, this was her only option because he was shooting at her, but if we look at the motivations of why this was even in the film to begin with, everything gets muddy. Why they would shoot at this officer is never discussed, even who this person is is left a mystery! It’s a contrived situation that serves no purpose other than to let the filmmakers say, “Look! Policing is scary business!” It’s just forwarding that narrative that it’s okay for the police to shoot civilians. There’s a thread running through thriller and horror movies that was first pointed out in 1992 by Carol J. Clover’s.  It’s what she calls the “Final Girl trope”, in which the final surviving character in a horror movie has to be female, because “abject terror” is only truly credible in a woman. According to Clover, true horror cannot be experienced by white male characters in cinema. Even when robbed of their weapons or jobs or status, white men are still in possession of a metanarrative of power—they’re not the right candidate for catharsis. White men are perceived as socially and physically dominant, they would have no problem fighting off a bad guy from a horror movie. Women, on the other hand, are seen as brittle creatures who are incapable of defending themselves. A perfect contender for cheap horror movie scares that prey on outdated and regressive social politics. The movie itself has a 96 percent chance of being directed by a man. One reason why we never see men gripped by fear in our popular narratives is that men like to feel powerful, and most of the time, they’re the ones telling the stories. Even though women account for 52 percent of moviegoers, of the top 100 grossing films of 2016, women represented 19% of producers, 14% of editors, 11% of writers, 4% of directors, and only 3% of cinematographers. Kathryn Bigelow is the only woman to ever win the Academy Award for Best Director. A female cinematographer has never been nominated for an Oscar. Women comprised 29% of protagonists. And 76% of all female characters were white in the top 100 films of 2016. When a movie ends with a loaded statistic about missing Native American women who are rarely investigated, it’s hard not to scoff at the fact that the film preceding it offers noticeably minimal screen time dedicated to said Native American women. This isn’t a crime movie, it’s not a neo noir, it’s not even a western, Wind River falls squarely into the “white savior” genre. Wind River portrays the bitter realities of the reservation only where relevant to the white characters of the story, the other time is spent with poorly shot shootouts and bland, emotionless dialogue scenes. The whole film is built upon the flimsy foundation of a young woman’s mysterious death, but the mystery itself is revealed in an abrupt flashback! A FLASHBACK for god sake! The whole reveal of whodunnit was contrived and awkward. When writing a mystery, the audience should be able to tell who the killer is if they look hard enough, and for the right clues. All the story threads should interlock and lead to a surprising, practical solution. When the killer comes out of left field and is someone who has never been in the film before, it’s a lackluster experience for the viewer. It’s not satisfying when the answer comes out of nowhere. But if the killer was someone who we know, who we trust, someone who’s an actual character in the film, it’s infinitely more intriguing and rewarding for the viewer. An audience isn’t looking for answers, they’re looking for a puzzle. The joy of a jigsaw isn’t seeing the picture that was on the box but bigger and on your dining room table, it’s figuring out if this middle piece fits here or there, and where this piece goes, and connecting all of these little clues in a way that FEELS organic. A mystery like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy takes a nonlinear approach of setting up a mystery, building upon it, and ultimately folding in on itself in the best way possible. Wind River is a strictly linear experience that holds the audience’s hand through the film. It almost felt like one of those on rails Disney rides like the haunted mansion, here’s one clue that leads directly to the next one, again and again until the credits. The reveal doesn’t ring true cinematically. The jump between a few scattered puzzle pieces and a finished jigsaw doesn’t come across as natural and, by providing all the answers in one go, the writer-director limits audience engagement. Now it’s time for some quotes from this year’s most underrated auteur. “I’m an actor.” Why stop tom? You were probably a better actor than director. He says he’s made up some mantras that help him when he writes, “I’ve made up little mantras for myself, catchphrases from a screenwriting book that doesn’t exist.” These are his original creations. \n\n* 1) “Write the movie you’d pay to go see.”  wow what a revolutionary! I’ve never heard that said anywhere! That’s not basic advice for amateur screenwriters! \n\n* 2) “Never let a character tell me something that the camera can show me.” show don’t tell totally isn’t a common writing cliche. You’re a genius! \n\n* 3) “You always want the audience wondering what’s going to happen next, never what’s happening.” keep them on their toes wow. Wind River does a great job of simultaneously throwing unexplainable plot points at the audience while staying cliche and predictable the whole way through, good job! \n\n* 4)I’m fascinated with complex characters” what complex characters?! A basic white savior? The empty husks of native characters? The cliche woman who’s a fish out of water in her own field? \n\n* 5) “I like to play with the way information about the plot is revealed. In Wind River, I reveal the “mystery” to the audience in a flashback” wow that’s a crazy idea!! A FLASHBACK?! What is this new and exciting world of structure!!!!??!? It’s totally not a crutch used by hack screenwriters who have written themselves into a narrative hole and don’t know how to dig themselves out by revealing information in an interesting way, so they just cut back to when it happened and show you! Not to mention that the scene itself is a weirdly excessive and just plain cruel. The same information could have been communicated without the gratuitous gore and sexualized violence. Renner’s character is basically an author insert: Sheridan lived on a reservation while working as an actor. I suppose he would say that while he was there he came up with this crazy new catchphrase “write what you know,”. “ THAT”S NOT WHAT THE PHRASE MEANS!!!! Write what you know doesn’t pertain to the physical location and biological description of the characters, but rather the emotions. That being said, this is advice that is told to young, inexperienced, ameture screenwriters who don’t know what to write about. It is NOT advice to live by. While personal stories can be intriguing, it is not the only type of story. There’s a pivotal scene about a third of the way into the film in which a medical examiner cannot say that the killing was a homicide because she froze to death. But, as Amy van den Broek points out, homicide is not a cause of death. Homicide is a manner of death. Medical examiners regularly determine both when they can. A medical examiner and ANYONE in law enforcement would know the difference between cause and manner. When a death occurs, a physician or medical examiner must fill out a death certificate. In order to properly complete this document, they must determine three things: the cause, the mechanism, and the manner of death. There is often confusion about which is which. The cause of death is the disease or injury that produces the physiological disruption inside the body resulting in death, for example, a gunshot wound to the chest. The mechanism of death is the physiological derangement that results in the death. An example of a mechanism of death due to the gunshot wound described above is exsanguination (extreme blood loss). Last but not least, the manner of death is how the death came about. Manner of death can be classified in six ways: 1) Natural 2) Accident 3) Suicide 4) Homicide 5) Undetermined 6) Pending. So while the film is technically correct, the medical examiner cannot say that the cause of death was by homicide, NOBODY CAN because homicide isn’t a cause of death! The entire film seems to have been a scrapped pilot for CSI: Wyoming. During the festival circuit, the writer-director touted this film as his directorial debut. But as Film School Rejects points out, not. He directed a low budget horror movie in 2009 called Vile. Vile appeared on Sheridan’s IMDB page until 2015, when it was removed and made to look like there was another director by the same name (though it was returned in January.) Sheridan’s own publicity team has wiped any reference to the film, and he has insisted on referring to Wind River as his debut over the course of Sundance. Acting like Wind River is Sheridan’s first film gives him an unearned boost while acting like smaller films don’t matter unless we want them to. \n\n.\n\nIs Wind River a story about the unacknowledged trials of Native American women? A sincere exploration of male grief? Or simply a vengeance movie that leverages the deaths of young women to up its emotional kick? I don’t doubt that Sheridan aspired to some combination of the first two; I fear that what he wound up with was closer to the final one.Wind River is about the straightest adaptation of a Taylor Sheridan script yet, and it reminds us well and good why great screenwriters do not make the best directors.\n",

        "text": "Almost 6 years after The Dark Knight Rises release back in 2012, The Dark Knight Trilogy is probably THE reference for comic book movies and super heroes movies. There was so many who tried to at least emulate the virtues of Nolan's trilogy. Some of them were decent, others failed miserably (I'm looking at you Man of Steel).\n\nThere is a lot to talk about Nolan's work with Batman, there is a lot to learn too (from good things and few bad things too). We can talk about these movies from a cinematic perspective  (directing, writing, acting, cinematography, pacing etc). We can talk about their influence in the comic book movies, and how Nolan builded one of the references of good storytelling in that genre (including how the trilogy created some new cliches that we can see in all of the subsequent super heroes movies). But the discussion I want with this post is from a more philosophical perspective.\n\nBeyond being super heroes movies, beyond being an adaptation of a comic book character for a movie, beyond being great movies regardless of the genre with good storytelling, we can see The Dark Knight Trilogy as a great philosofical debate between 3 points of view about a universal problem. And I want to explain what are the 3 points of view and what this universal problem is. \n\nFirst we have to understand what is the universal problem. The great discussion of Nolan's trilogy is about Gotham's soul and/or the soul of the people of the city. Since we are dealing with universal problems and subjects, Gotham represents the world and Humanity as a whole. It's like in Mother!, where the house was Earth, and Javier Bardem's office was the Garden of Eden. And this situation of people of Gotham being a symbol for all Humanity is similar with how the work of Dostoevsky portrays the Russia from 19th Century. Dostoevsky work was truly about his country of his time, but at the same time the Russia from 2 centuries ago seems to be the stage of the world. Dostoevsky understanded that Russia from 19th Century was dealing with all the philosophical and spiritual problems that marks all History. So he talks about Russia but at the same time he talks about the world as a whole in any time or place, or simply universal. That's how we have to look to Gotham in The Dark Knight Trilogy: as a stage of the world. \n\nIn all the 3 movies, the characters talk about how Gotham's soul is lost in degradation, corruption, violence and criminality. And that's the universal problem: what is the solution to Gotham's problem (or the Humanity problem)? In the story, we have 3 different answers to that question. \n\nThroughout the story of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, we see a very deep discussion between 3 different philosophical visions. What are they? Or who are they?\n\n* The first one is the League of Shadows, represented by 3 important characters: Ra's Al Ghul, Bane and Talia Al Ghul (or Miranda). The League of Shadows vision says that the solution to Gotham's problem is simply destruction and death. There are many ways to interpret this point of view. We can start by saying that the League sees itself as having the power of a God from the Old Testament, and Gotham being their Sodom and Gomorrah. Just like what Ra's Al Ghul says to Bruce, they destructed all the great civilizations that were lost in sin and corruption, the League represents the divine power and the divine retribution that must always be there to kill all sin and open for a new possibility to try to make the things right. The difference is that God's retribution is a light from the sky, and the League's retribution is a revenge from the shadows. Another way of interpretation and reference is that the League's vision is similar to the vision of some of the revolutionary nihilist characters of Dostoevsky work like Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, Smerdyakov in The Karamazov Brothers, and Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in Demons. The ends justify the means. Is destroy to purify. Kill for an ideal. And if we are talking about Dostoevsky characters, we can talk about Albert Camus work too. The League of Shadows is the perfect embodiment and a perfect example from Pop Culture of the one of the most important subjects in Camus work: the philosophical rebellion, the revolt and the rebel. Camus explain in his philosophical essay The Rebel that the rebel is someone who don't see a murder as an act of impulsivness and anger, but as a medical, clinical and methodic act. Violence, aggression, murder and terrorism is justified for a greater good. And everyone who go against that greater good must be killed as an insect. \n\n* The second one is Batman. If the League of Shadows was Old Testament, Batman is New Testament. Is not more about destruction and arbitrary punishment, is about salvation, faith, hope and redemption. To Batman, the solution to Gotham's problem is improve a decadent system, and believe that the system can work. Bale's Batman always says that the Batman is not a person, but a symbol. Batman must be a moral and ethical reference to every person of Gotham. He can be anyone, because there are always hope for someone to do the right thing when all the society and all the political and social do the wrong thing. Bruce drama throughout the 3 films is about his struggle of being Bruce Wayne in one hand, a normal person with normal problems and that he can do both right and wrong choices, and being Batman, a symbol that can't do anything wrong. This is similar to V from Alan Moore's V for Vendetta, but if V is a symbol for freedom, Batman is a symbol for moral and ethics. Similar to Christ, Batman sacrifices himself at the end of The Dark Knight for people of Gotham don't lose their hope in a symbol of good. The Dark Knight Rises is the Apocalypse and the Book of Revelations, with Harvey Dent being the false leader/god/symbol and Batman returning after a long time to separate the evils from the goods and start a new age of light and hope. We can see Batman's moral code as a very Kantian vision. I don't think we can call Batman a 100% Kantian character, since he sometimes have to break some rules to maintain himself as Batman, but his one rule of not kill anyone is very Kantian, because is a example of Kant most famous philosophical idea that is the imperative categorical. Kant more famous quote explain the imperative categorical and, by consequence, Batman view on morality perfectly:\n\n   \"Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.\n\n* And the third and final one is the Joker. For Joker, the solution to Gotham's problem is simply nothing. There is no solution, there is no hope. Joker's vision go against both the League of Shadows's philosophical and political cynicism and Batman's humanism. The League believes in destruction, Batman believes in reconstruction, the Joker doesn't believe in anything. This is the typical pessimistic nihilism that we can find in philosophers like Schopenhauer and Cioran, and the madness and misanthropy that we can find in a  Maldoror from Lautréamont's Les Chants de Maldoror. Even one of the most iconic Joker quotes is a modified version of of one of the famous quotes by Nietzsche:\n\n   Nietzsche: \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\"\n   \n  Joker: \"What doesn't kill you makes you stranger\"\n\n There is an erroneous interpretation about Joker's character that says he is an anarchist. If we are talking about Joker from Alan Moore's The Killing Joke and Nolan's The Dark Knight at least, then there is nothing of anarchist in Joker. Anarchism is a philosophical, political and social theory defended by many authors like Bakunin and Prudhon that says the only way of society to progress is the destruction of all the institutions of power like the State, Church, Family etc. There is anything like that in Joker personal philosophy. He don't want to impose any social and political model. He doesn't want anarchy, he wants chaos. But not social chaos or political chaos, social chaos and political chaos are ways to Joker gets what he really wants: moral chaos, mental chaos and spiritual chaos. For Joker, there is no hope for Gotham's soul (Humanity's soul) because nobody can maintain their own moral code. Anyone can break his own moral and what he thinks is good. For Joker, human soul is fragil and anyone can become a monster or everybody can show the monster inside of every one of them, you just have to put people in another context, or by Joker words:\n\n  \"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am........Just one bad day.\"\n\n He almost got that in The Killing Joke, he got that with Harvey Dent and he wants that with Batman. For him, Humanity's original sin is an eternal fact. Darkness is our nature. History is mark by Chaos. For Joker, the only thing we can do about Humanity's problem is just seat, laughs and watch the spectacle. Joker intentions are almost a paradox, because he do everything to prove to everyone that we can't do anything.  And that's why Batman can't kill the Joker, because he would be breaking his own moral values and would be proving Joker point, and then he would be becoming what Joker is: a mad person that lost hope in everything. And Batman being a symbol must show to the people of Gotham that Joker is wrong. But for Joker, there is no heroes and villains, just demons. We can resume Joker philosophy by using another Nietzsche quote:\n\n  \"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee\"\n\nAt the end of The Dark Knight Rises, is easy to us to think that the Batman won that discussion, but since Joker was the ultimate fall to everything that Batman has builded, we see that he have some valid points and that this debate is not over yet. That discussion being universal, we will see many other Batmans, Leagues of Shadows and Jokers in the future to continue the question about Gotham's/Humanity's soul.\n\nEven if The Dark Knight is the only flawless masterpiece of the trilogy, and Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises being flawed excellent movies, Nolan's trilogy reached something that any other comic book film did. Transcends the triviality of the genre and is something beyond of being just another super hero movies, and at least gave something deep to say or something deep that we can discuss (with Watchmen maybe being an exception, but is an adaptation of a pre existing work). The only times we got something similar was with the classics from the comic book universe like Alan Moore's Watchmen, V for Vendetta, The Killing Joke. Even if is not a flawless and perfect trilogy, is one of the most philosophical piece of work that I ever see in Cinema (or at least The Dark Knight) alongside with Bergman movies for example. And I know that sounds exaggerated and crazy, but in my miserable opinion this is what I think.\n\nBetween all the action and the typical Nolan traces, there is a very deep debate about morality, ethics, hope, pessimism, nihilism, political and philosophical cynicism, the fragility of humanism, the fragility of human soul, if the ends justify the means etc etc etc.\n",

        "text": "I just can not pin Chabrol down, and I love this about him. \n\nI just finished watching *Que La Bete Meure* (1969) and once more find myself delighted by this intriguing, witty, audacious director. Yes I was engaged by the plot - pretty unremarkable in itself, not so much a 'who done it?' as an 'is he going to do it? - but what really kept me glued to the film was not so much trying to second guess the protagonist, as trying to second guess Chabrol himself. \n\nTake for example a scene towards the end of the film, where the main character confesses a secret he's been hiding from his love interest up to this point. This is a *big* secret (trying not to make this a spoiler post here) and the confession is something we have been waiting for for about an hour and a quarter by now. So it's a climactic scene. The couple are in a restaurant and have ordered the duck. \n\nHow does Chabrol choose to film this important scene? Well... oddly. The couple are not facing each other, but side by side, their backs pressed against a bright white wall. The table acts as a constant barrier between camera and actors. On the table is a large bunch of flowers, and during the scene it's really the flowers that get most of the camera's attention - or at least the flowers get way more attention than one feels they should, as much of the time the actor's faces are partially obscured by them. Co-starring alongside the flowers is the duck, which far from being obscured, gets a full, screen filling close up - and not just once. The duck is brought to the table - the duck is carved - the duck is laid out on a sizzling platter - anyone in the audience who hasn't eaten for a while is likely to have completely forgotten the plot by now. \n\nThe overall effect is.... well, it's *funny* to be honest - but here is where Chabrol's extraordinarily delicate sense of balance comes in. Because although there is a *lot* of flowers and duck, there is not so very much that the scene tips over into something obviously ridiculous. It's just a *bit* ridiculous, so much so that your brain can never quite settle on any definite judgement as to how ridiculous the scene really is. You ask - is it ridiculous, or is it simply wonderfully expressive? Are duck and flowers symbolic of some subtextual element we perhaps *should* be aware of, but simply have not had time to consider? Or, and this remains a possibility, is Chabrol just having a laugh? \n\nWe don't know - but the overall effect is not confusing - it's delightful (old fashioned word, I know, but I can't think of a better one to describe how I feel when watching Chabrol). The flower and duck tricks - for tricks are surely what they are - manage somehow to keep the scene so *alive*, so energetic! And ultimately they pay service to the action of the scene itself. The energy they create does not distract from the action of the scene, but it feeds into it. By setting up small barriers and hurdles for the viewer, Chabrol somehow makes us more determined to pay attention to the action, determined to stay with it. We can't help but make an effort - Chabrol forces our hand. Perhaps above all else, Chabrol is *clever*. \n\nDoes anyone else enjoy this kind of vivacity Chabrol brings to the screen? Do you have a completely different take on Chabrol's technique? What films by Chabrol would you say are *must sees*? Does he have a 'masterpiece' or two in his filmography? Come on -\n let's talk about Chabrol. ",

        "text": "I just remembered an old argument my brother and I had when we were first watching The Prestige. (Spoilers ahead obviously)\n\nIn the movie, Christian Bale's character regularly ties the hands of Hugh Jackman's wife during the show for her water escape. After the first show we see, Michael Caine tells Bale, \"You dropped the knot again,\" and that he has to be careful to make sure Jackman's wife doesn't fall. \nBale says, \"It's the wrong knot,\" and a different knot would be better. But Caine argues that Bale's knot might be more difficult to slip underwater. \nBale argues, but Jackman tells him to drop the issue and continue tying the original knot. \nThe next time we see the trick, Bale starts tying one knot, then changes his mind and ties another knot. Jackman's wife then drowns. At the funeral, Jackman demands to know which knot Bale tied, but Bale refuses to answer.\n\nMy brother and I interpreted this two different ways and we got in a huge fight about it!! It actually got pretty heated lmao.\n\nMy interpretation says that Bale tied his OWN knot, and Caine's prediction came true. He doesn't tell Jackman what knot he tied because he feels guilty and they both already know anyway.\nOn the other hand, my brother believed that Bale is the best at magic and was actually correct about wanting to change the knot. But he ultimately decided to do what Caine and Jackman told him to do and tied the original knot, but Jackman's wife died anyway. Bale didn't tell Jackman which knot he tied because he didn't want to make Jackman feel like the death was his fault.\n\nI'm pretty confident I'm correct here, but I wanted to get some other opinions about the scene. (And I know, out of all the insane stuff that happens in this movie, this detail is what we chose to focus on. It's silly, but once we start fighting we can't stop!)",

        "text": "So I'm back with another one of these in depth reviews of films. Today's one is for Zack Snyder's 2013 superhero/sci fi film Man Of Steel. I'll admit I was never the biggest Superman fan. I never disliked him (Except in Superman 3 and 4), but he was never one of my favorite heroes. But when I saw MOS, I grew a real appreciation for the character. I love this movie and think it should be mentioned along side The Dark Knight and Logan as the greats of the comic book movie genre.\n\nThe film starts off great with the Krypton scenes (All of which look gorgeous thanks to amazing SFX and set designs and Larry Fong's cinematography). We see that the planet is about t be destroyed due to mining of it's core and that Joer-El (Played brilliantly by Russel Crowe) and wife just had a son (Kal-El) who is the first natural birth in years. Everyone on Krypton is essentially engineered at birth to become a solider or doctor or a scientist, but Kal-El is the first true natural birth in a long time and is free to chose his destiny. Brilliant idea on from Zack Snyder and David Goyer.\n\nAfter we see Krypton's destruction, the film decide's to start using it's nonlinear story telling and cut years later to Kal El/Clark Kent as an adult working on a ship and saving everyone there before when it crashes into an oil rig. We learn that Kal-El has been using different aliases and getting different jobs after he's forced to use his powers to save people. We also get a lot of great flashbacks to him as a kid in Smallville. My favorite ones are when his X-Ray vision kicks in during school and his mom tells him to imagine himself on a beautiful and quiet island to calm down, where he has to save the people on the bus when it falls into the water and his dad tells him he has to keep his powers a secret (I know most people hate when Pa Kent says \"Maybe\" when Clark asks him if he should've let everyone die, but I think he responded with that because he honestly didn't know how he felt about that), when Pa Kent finally shows Clark the ship where they found him and tells him he's an alien from another world (Powerful acting from Kevin Costner in this scene BTW), and when Pa Kent is killed by the tornado and he tells his son not to save him since he feels the world isn't ready to know about his powers yet (Not gonna lie, this scene actually made me tear up a little).\n\nSince I've mentioned that Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner are great in this film, let's talk about Michael Shannon as General Zod. Brilliant. Unlike Terrace Stamp's Zod (Who I did like), he's not a one note character. He does have that hate on for Joer-El's son like in the comics and past films, but he's also a guy who is trying to save his race and will do almost anything to do it. And the villains who think they're the heroes are the most freighting.\n\nNow let's talk about Supes himself Henry Cavill, fantastic. Some people complain that he's wooden. I disagree. I thought he was great and really sold a god trying to find his place in our society. One my favorite moments in the film is when Kal puts on the Superman suit and flies for the first time and the look on Cavill's face is \"Oh my god! Wow. I'm f#cking flying!\". I do wish he has better chemistry with Amy Adams's Lois Lane though. Both give great performances in this film, but I felt like they didn't develop real chemistry until Batman V Superman (My next review in this series) and fell in love way too fast.\n\nThe action in the film is some of the best I've ever seen in a CBM/sci fi film. The fight in Smallville is fantastic (Even with the unnecessary product placement) and the final battle in Metropolis is great, although I do feel it could've been trimmed down a bit (Like they could've gotten rid of the giant tentacle machine and get to the Zod battle). And the Zod battle is very realistic, that's how a fight between 2 gods would happen. And everyone complains about how Superman was fighting him in a city where innocent people are. Keep this in mind though, Kal/Clark has only been Superman for less than a day and is fighting an experiences solider who said that he's keeping the battle in the city until one of them dies. There are also some really good easter eggs/foreshadowing for BVS in this fight with the Wayne Satellite and the LexCorp logos and the Batman poster.\n\nAnd of course, there's the whole Superman snapping Zod's neck thing that caused a lot of controversy. I believe he had to do it. There was no other choice. Zod was about to kill an innocent family and every one else on Earth, The Phantom Zone was already closed off, and there's no prison on Earth that could hold him. And Supes didn't want to kill Zod, but he had too and screamed in agony that it came to that and that he killed the only other Kryptonian on Earth.\n\nAnd before I forget, the score by Hans Zimmer is all kinds of awesome. Very uplifting and thrilling and heroic (Perfect for a Superman score). I'll even go as far as to say that I like this score more than John Williams's score.\n\nSo overall, I love this film and think it deserved much better reviews when it came out. IMO It's a great CB film, a great sci fi film, a great start to a DC universe, and a great character study about a god in out society with fantastic performances from everyone, great action, amazing score, great cinematography, etc.\n\nI give MOS a 4.5/5. I do think some of the action in the final battle could've been cut and Kal El and Lois Lane could've had better chemistry (Although I do like their final conversion and the Welcome To The Planet line at the end), but other than that, I think this film is phenomenal and one of the greats of the CBM genre.\n\nWhat do you think of Man Of Steel? Love it? Hate it? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)",

        "text": "I just saw a remarkable film last night \"DTRT\". Here are some aspects of that film that I noticed:\n\n* \"Smiley\" never really smiles at all in the movie. However, at the climatic scene where the pizzeria is on fire, he posts a picture which he may have colorized himself in the burning building. Then he backs up, and with flames illuminating from his head and crown, he smiles. The flames made it look like he was some Biblical figure with a halo. It was quite poignant. Also, that photo of Malcolm X and MLK were the first African-American images in that pizzeria, and finally, whereas all the previous photos of Italian-American were in B&amp;W, I believe that this photo of Malcolm X and MLK were hand-colored. \n\n* The neighborhood was having fun with the fire hydrants, and ironically, later on in the day, they were getting hosed by the police by the same fire hydrants. \n\n* In the middle of the day, the two policemen were patrolling the area, and they said \"What a waste.\" I may be over looking into this, but it looked like they were looking lustily at the men as if they were gay.\n\n* I can't understand Radio Raheem's role in the movie. However, he did do some commentary about LOVE and HATE. When he was killed in a lynching-style killing at the hands of the white police, we see his dead body prominently with the words \"LOVE.\"  However, he menacingly went all over the neighborhood with \"Fight The Power\" blaring all day that was quite offensive. \n\nMy theory about his flaws was that Spike Lee wanted to convey the message that Blacks aren't perfectly anti-racist - just like Whites. Moreover, they both have flaws and both will do racist things if they have the power to do so - thus uniting them in their humanity. Never forget in DTRT, some of the African-Americans, like Radio Raheem, espoused racist slurs to the Korean-American shop keepers, and Mother Sister even advocated burning down the pizzeria. \n\n* I believe that the hot day was some allusion to the hot freedom summer of Selma and Mississippi. \n\n* It seemed like Lee was trying to unite the Latinx, Korean-American (or Asian-American), and African-American communities together. \n\n* I didn't understand the significance of when the stuttering guy was able to take the scuff off his white shoe.\n\n* The Mayor correctly predicted that Sister-Mother and him would have a mutual understanding one day. \n\n* I don't understand the significance of Mookey's girlfriend dancing in the beginning, but it was brilliant. She danced with anger and determination. That's my opinion. She's fighting the power with her determination for happiness. \n\n* I don't know why they drank Miller, but I'm thinking that they were sponsored by Miller Beer. And Nike - since Spike Lee eventually advertised for them. \n\n* It's hard to empathize with the Italian-American who had his car hosed with water. But my best explanation is that the viewers, people like me another words, felt angry at the people who hosed his car. However, actual **people** got hosed down by that same water source during the climatic scene. \n\n* What's the significance of the $500 that Sal threw at Mookie, and Mookie initially gave him back $200, but later rescinded and took the $200 back? My theory is that by giving Sal $200 back (and thus he would have netted $300), Mookie said that he now owes Sal $50, which he'd give back later. This implies that he wasn't disowning Sal's friendship. \n\nHowever, he rescinded and took the $200 back, which implies to me that he wants nothing to do with Sal anymore. Mookie was always in a hurry to get his money from Sal. \n\n",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwIjnppSHTo\n\nSince the video is spoiler-filled, here’s some text that’s spoiler free. \n\nWhiplash is a story about pursuing something you love, and finding that the pursuit is full of a whole lot of anguish along the way. It tells that story through a Andrew, a jazz drummer that wants to be great, and Terance Fletcher, a teacher who is driven to do whatever it takes to make his students great, but the way it plays that out is closer to the boot camp from Full Metal Jacket than the High School from Stand and Deliver. Fletcher asks a lot of his students, he verbally and physically abuses them, and still expects them to show up promptly or they will swiftly be replaced by any of the dozen students waiting in the wings desperately begging for a shot in his class. He plays good cop to learn a little about his students when they’re vulnerable, and throws it back in their face when they fail to meet his expectations. His expectation is that, through this abuse, they will be so afraid of humiliation and failure, that they will try much harder than they otherwise would. \n\nThe unsettling thing is, he’s kind of right... \n\nBecause Whiplash wants you to grapple with a very serious reality. If you want to be great at something you enjoy doing, you’re probably not going to enjoy it much longer. You’re going to have to bleed through your knuckles, or worse, in order to make real progress, or else. The alternative is being merely above average at the things you enjoy. The horror. That’s why people quit, though, or don’t start. Being good at something requires effort, and if you try, you might succeed, but is each failure you can anticipate, each humiliation, really worth the effort? If you enjoy doing something as is, then why put in the sweat to get better? \n\nI think Whiplash gave me a language to think about that kind of question, as I find myself running into it more and more. It doesn’t really reconcile it, by finding a balance between trying hard, but stepping back when reasonability goes out the window. There’s just a lot of… whiplash…\n\nSo, amidst all the thrilling peaks and valleys in this one, I’m wondering if that resonated with anyone else? ",

        "text": "I just finished watching the \"classic\" for the first time, and I feel I might have missed something. I find it hard to believe this is considered one of the greatest films ever made and a staple of Hollywood's golden age. First, the plot is simply ridiculous. (SPOILERS) I feel there are so many odd moments in the film. The fight outside the planetarium was the first thing that caught me off guard. Why do the greasers hate Jim before they even get to know him? I excused this due to the time period and overall ‘50s Hollywood cheesiness, but I just found it so unrealistic that an unprovoked Buzz slashed Jim’s tire, then pressured him into a knife fight. The next scene that stood out to me is when Jim comes home from the fatal chicken contest and attacks his father. I just felt it was so out of place. Jim is clearly suffering from some serious teen angst, but his behavior is just absurd throughout the entire film. Not to mention he’s a spoiled brat. Also, I found it weird that the greasers were somehow upset with Jim and felt he should pay for Buzz’s death. Wasn’t the whole thing Buzz’s idea anyways? It’s as if they exchanged all logic and reasoning so they could set up some sexy James Dean moments. However, I did enjoy the opening scene, the chicken contest, and the final scene at the observatory. Another thing I found odd was the dialogue. I generally forgive cheesy, cheap dialogue in old movies because of the generational gaps between the release of the film and present day, but there were moments in this movie where it felt like the writing was trying to be overly dramatic and deep without any substance to support it. The adults in the film seem to be the only ones based in reality. Side note: who the heck lets their kid roam the streets of Los Angeles on a school night? I also felt the character Plato was done so poorly. I understand he’s mentally disturbed and has some sort of attachment issues, but I feel he was all around weak. I can’t tell if that’s because of the writing or the actor, but every time the film shifted focus to Plato I was bored rather than intrigued by his odd behavior. Also, Dean’s acting was not spectacular. There were moments where he did shine (the opening scene), but I felt the shallow script severely limited him, and made for some of those odd moments I mentioned above. Overall, I gave the film a 7/10 for production value, a decent story, and some incredible cinematography, but I still don’t understand how this is considered a classic. Perhaps it’s the James Dean mythos. What do you think? Am I missing something?",

        "text": "I watched Masked and Anonymous the other day. For those who haven't heard of it, it's a movie written and starring singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. I thought it was a masterpiece. It had everything: good writing, good acting, good cinematography, good music. It made me want to watch it again after watching it once, and I have rewatched it a few times since. I wondered if the movie had any following online, so I looked it up. It had a 23% critical score on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 45% audience score. Some comments said it was \"a good contender for worst movie of the century\" and it had \"absolutely no redeemable qualities.\" I thought maybe despite having poor reviews, it might be a cult classic, but I really didn't see it being discussed anywhere. It seemed to have just come and gone.\n\nFor those who haven't seen it, which is probably most of you, Masked and Anonymous is set in a dystopian and war-torn North American republic. The entire movie has a constant presence of crime, homelessness, poverty, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. The movie centers around Jack Fate (Bob Dylan), a musician pulled out of prison to perform a one-man benefit concert that will supposedly help the \"real victims of the revolution.\" John Goodman and Jessica Lange star as slimy drunken promoters using the concert for their own personal gain. Jeff Bridges plays a reporter investigating the concert to see who exactly will benefit. Much of the movie serves as vignettes, where Fate examines and tries to understand the broken world he lives in. The movie deals with themes of anarchy, law, dreams, and God.\n\nThe movie isn't that long, it's about an hour an 40 minutes long. I really recommend you all watch it. The acting is great, it's fully of quotable moments, and it really will come back to you after you watch it. \n\nWith all that being said, I don't understand why critics didn't like it. It seemed to me to be a very straightforward indie movie. Critics like Roger Ebert, for example, called it \"pretentious.\" At no point did I think the movie was being patronizing or artsy for the sake of being artsy, and it didn't strike me as at all pretentious. This stuck out for me as a criticism, because I generally dislike critical darling oscar-winners for being too pretentious, so it seemed weird that this movie I actually really liked was being called what I think a lot of other movies are. Am I just a natural contrarian? \n\nLike I said, you should definitely give this movie a watch and tell me what you think. Are the critics and audience right, or is this movie an underrated masterpiece?",

        "text": "One thing I think films need to take advantage of more is silence. The wind blowing through the trees in an auditory perspective. \n\nFilms like Hunger (2008) and Darkness on the Edge of Town (2014) really use dialogue sparingly. The driving force in these movies is the cinematic story telling, where the camera shows you the story as well as beautifully composed shots. I think a lot of movies miss that mark of story telling.  \n\nI think in a way this is caused by the ability of the story to tell emotion. Films like the one mentioned above are written so beautifully that they don't need anything more to provide that emotion to the audience. For me watching those movies was a sort of fresh air. \n\nA lot of movies I've seen have music almost constantly in the back ground, while this can be a good part of the setting (See Gettysburg (1993), most of the time it has been filler, not as an accessory or compliment to the story for providing emotion, but to provide emotion. A good example of this is in horror films. Modern \"scary\" movies have music that builds up the tension, and creates the emotion, the atmosphere. In a film like The Exorcist (1973) it's the story that creates the creepy/freaky atmosphere.\n\nWhat is the reason for this? Am I misunderstanding the purposes of those genres? From this prospective, the story telling is weak so music and sound effects are there to provide the missing emotion. Is it just bad story telling, or something else? What do you guys think about the possible overuse of music in today's films?\n",

        "text": "Video Form: https://youtu.be/7qx9xwn2ybE\n\nDavid Fincher likes to treat his audience with respect. In 1995, his second motion picture Se7en was released to shock the world. At the time, certain critics argued that the movie had no substance and it was just a gruesome spectacle. However, upon deeper analysis, you will find that Se7en is actually a very subtle movie in a lot of ways. It is this subtlety that many filmmakers, especially directors today decide to renounce. They hit you over the head so much with whatever the movie is trying to say that it gets to the point of being even insulting to the audience as if we don’t have the capacity to understand what the movie is trying to tell us. Fincher, on the other hand, only shows us just what we need to see or hear to get the point across.\n In the opening credits, there are very clever cuts in sound and image whenever things start getting too disturbing. Another example is that for the majority of the movie we have no idea who the killer is. Kevin Spacey was even left out of all the marketing and opening credits.\nA Nameless City\nSince we don’t know the identity of the killer for the majority of the movie, the city plays a huge part in the story. In this vividly realized location, the setting itself is the antagonist for the majority of the film. Ambiguity is key here since we never know exactly where the story takes place, but we get just the right amount of information. It’s constantly raining and it’s seen and referred to as an ugly, disgusting place filled with crime. Not revealing the actual location where the story takes place is an extremely smart idea. While there certainly is crime in big cities like Chicago or New York City, we already know that these cities also have positive traits to them like culture. In Se7en’s nameless city, it’s all misery.\nRestriction is Key\nFincher proves with Se7en over and over again that less is more: As an audience by knowing just certain things about what’s happening on screen and not the whole picture, we have to paint some of that picture ourselves. This is an important aspect of horror movies, the extreme example being The Blair Witch Project. A lot of times imagining is even worse than actually seeing.\nA further example is the great Lust scene. We are given just enough information to connect the dots for ourselves, but that is enough. Fincher never actually shows any of the murders take place, which is a pretty bright choice because it leaves a lot of ambiguity for who the killer actually is and because we can play detective.\nSo the point is, Se7en could have very easily been really bad. It easily could have been some kind of corny slasher flick and it would have been really easy to just make it a gory spectacle in New York City or Chicago, where we see a guy fuck a prostitute with a knife for a dildo and Gwyneth Paltrow’s freaking head in a box. But we never do, and Se7en works exactly because of this. Great scenes like the dinner scene at Mills’ apartment or the diner scene with Tracy and Somerset, show us that the focus isn’t really on the violence, but on the people. These restrictions on violence effectively build up the dread more and more until we get a very good payoff. And it is, it’s one of the best examples of building up and finally paying off, although the ending is hardly satisfying.\n“Wanting people to listen, you can’t just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you’ll notice you’ve got their strict attention.”\nThe Ending That Shook the World\nSpacey dominates the final act of the movie. Being under arrest, Doe is an apparent position of weakness. But Spacey’s head haloed by the Sun foreshadows he is on his way to achieving his supposed religious purpose. John Doe is always shot on very stable close-ups, on a tripod. Mills, on the other hand, is shot handheld, showing his lack of control. Brad Pitt was dating Gwyneth Paltrow at the time so all the easier for him to show his emotions.\nNew Line Cinema actually went against the ending of the movie for being too dark and tried to change it several times. Some of these endings include Mill’s dog’s head in the box and not Tracy’s. Another one was Somerset kills Doe before Mills gets to kill him and says something like “I’m retiring anyway.”. Luckily, Fincher fought til’ the end and Brad Pitt ended up saying he would ditch the project if the ending changed. Even after all of this, test audiences disliked the original ending of the film, which was supposed to end with Mills shooting Doe, and walking away from Somerset.\nRejecting Apathy\n“People will barely be able to comprehend. But they won’t be able to deny.”\nSo the Hemingway quote was added, and while this wasn’t intended, it’s a perfect statement to reflect the central theme of the movie.  ‘The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.’ I agree with the second part. This shows us the progress of Somerset as a character, as he is no longer filled with apathy. It also reflects Fincher’s ideas and the central theme of the film: “I think people are perverts. I’ve maintained that, that’s been the foundation of my career.” But in the end, it’s pretty amazing to be alive, so it’s all worth it.\nSomerset’s arc and the theme of the movie perfectly match up. At the beginning of the film, he is trying to get as far away from the city as possible. But he reaches catharsis in the end and realizes that after everything, it’s still worth fighting for good in the world. In a very odd way, Se7en is strangely optimistic. Se7en shows us the worst parts of humanity, but it uses its awful circumstances to deliver a message of optimism. It shows that anyone can be exposed to the worst parts of humanity, but instead of falling victim to it, you can come out stronger on the other side and refuse to give in to apathy.\nThe Message in Se7en\nSe7en is a great movie, with one of the most memorable endings in movie history. It put Hollywood clichés like buddy cops to the test, and it worked. It stands tall as one of the most atmospheric movies ever made. Every moment is filled with dread and although it´s a violent movie, Fincher knows exactly what to show and when to do so. So in a way, it’s a very restricted movie. New filmmakers should look up at Se7en as an example of how not to be overly indulgent, and to treat the audience with the respect we deserve.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7oeuq9/the_last_jedi_and_the_collapse_of_the_archetypes/",
        "text": "My premise here is pretty simple: the archetypal stories from the original Star Wars trilogy were wrapped up at the end of The Return of the Jedi, and returning to those characters was therefore a mistake.\n\nIf the new trilogy had been able to fold those archetypes into the new adventures in an elegant way, then great, but they obviously didn't.\n\nLet's start with Han Solo. Han in the original trilogy is an amoral rogue who ends up moving toward the good because of his love for a good woman and the good friends that he makes. By the beginning of The Force Awakens he's . . . an amoral rogue again? Turns out he's also an absentee husband, a deserter of the Rebellion, a shit father, a bad businessman and a cheat.\n\nThen there's the archetypal confusion of how he dies. The Force Awakens wants to hit all the beats of A New Hope, so a father figure has to unexpectedly die, but it can't be Luke, because that's too obvious given the Obi-Wan story. But Han doesn't sacrifice himself in a meaningful way, he's murdered by his own son while trying to reconnect with his own goodness and redeem his son, a sort of inverse Luke/Anakin story. So he lived a shit life and died a shit death - to what end? Feels?\n\nLet's talk about Leia. OT (original trilogy) Leia is kind of a joker, a David before King David, living in the shadow world of the Rebellion, striking out at the evil empire/existing order. The rebellion is successful because it's good, she fulfills her potential and becomes Princess Leia in fact as well as name, destined to rule the galaxy with justice and grace.\n\nNT Leia is a perpetual terrorist, telling her devotees that even though everything they've ever achieved is lost, almost everyone she's known and loved is dead or evil, and that nothing they've done has had a lasting effect on the galaxy, the Rebellion has \"everything we need, right here.\" Meaning, we have a steady supply of young wide-eyed devotees willing continue dying for no reason other than the perpetuation of the war. And it cuts from there to the young Jedi with the broom, if I remember correctly. It was so cynical it made my heart hurt.\n\nHere's another example of her new cynicism. When Poe, who in The Force Awakens was a competent and trusted pilot, loses his mind, gets his whole crew killed, and then tries unsuccessfully to commit mutiny, while sending his friends into mortal danger: what's Leia's attitude? \"I like him.\" What the hell kind of attitude is that if you care about your people living and your organization being sustainable?\n\nSo Luke. Luke is a weird one because he's almost a token character. This is where the archetypes are really painted into a corner, because what Luke _should_ be is Obi-Wan without the hubris of the prior generations of Jedi. He should have been able to learn from Obi-Wan's wisdom and mistakes, especially since Yoda and Obi-Wan can instruct him from the spirit realm. And at the very least he should have had some immensely positive impact on the galaxy. But that's not where they wanted to start the new story, so Luke couldn't continue on his previous archetypal trajectory of becoming a wise and powerful master. So Luke had to suck just as much as the previous Jedi at detecting a Sith master undermining his efforts and was ultimately cowardly, retreating from the galaxy entirely and basically just waiting to die. It's hard to understand why the writers would put him in this position without understanding what they are doing with Rey and Star Wars in general.\n\nHere's what I find the most perplexing about the positive reception of the new direction: no one seems to mention that Rian Johnson put the justification for the storytelling choices _into the mouth of his villain_. Kylo Ren just nakedly tells us the storytelling strategy: burn it all to the ground. Do what you have to do to move forward.\n\n!!!\n\nNot to make this political, but that strategy reeks of \"burn the patriarchy\" as well. I don't think it's a coincidence that by the end of The Last Jedi, the only good white man left alive (Poe) is kind of an idiot who is tolerated because the women like him. All the rest of the white men are blithering fascists. That's discouraging from the perspective that the Rebellion is the inclusive society, but the New Order, like the Empire, is a white nationalist (galaxist?) sexist group. Somehow despite all of their heavy losses, the New Order can keep recruiting racist sexist white men (presumably a subset of white men, themselves a tiny subset of the galactic population) at a rate greater than the inclusive Rebellion can find recruits? And no one in the galaxy comes to their aid? That's a great message for our times.\n\nBack to Rey. Rey's symbolc meaning becomes more clear in the scene where she repeats Luke's Dagobah experience. She gets sucked into the vortex of the Dark Side to confront her past, just as Luke had to confront the spectre of Darth Vader with his own face. Luke learned that he, his past and the evil awaiting him in the future are somehow connected, and then in Return of the Jedi he has to learn how they are connected and break the connection with the evil inside him by denying the Emperor's appeal to his Dark Side. He thus redeems his father and saves the galaxy.\n\nRey learned that there is no past. As the two figures, which you momentarily assume are her parents, approach the dark mirror that she gazes into, they merge into one and that one is her. Kylo Ren later spells it out for her: none of that old shit matters. There's just the now and the infinite you (the endless string/circle of Reys). That's why Luke's story makes so little sense/has so little resonance. It's not about Luke, it's about Rey. The old Jedi stuff has to burn in a fire (literally) and Luke has to disappear for the Star Wars story to move forward.\n\nYour parents, your history, your traditions, your culture, it's all irrelevant. There is only the now. You can be as strong as the greatest Jedi not only without instruction, but without even knowing what your options are (e.g., Rey's mind control). Everything you need is inside you! And those old Jedi were pretty bad at their jobs anyway, they mostly screwed the galaxy over time and time again, in the process providing the enemy with powerful Sith to lead and aid them.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to critique the movie from a plot perspective in order to understand why it has so little resonance. I mean, the main plot is a 2 hour long straight-line car chase in which one car is waiting to run out of gas, but then Ryan Reynolds spent most of a movie in a coffin, so it's not like plot summaries are crucial to movies being good. \n\nAnd I think more representation for different groups on-screen is great, but that ultimately it will be more and more commonplace and then the movie won't have anything going for it. And, if representation is your goal, isn't it pretty insulting to have a black man and Asian woman run around accomplishing nothing in a PETA commercial and then utterly failing at their mission?\n\nEven the few \"fun\" moments feel wrong upon reflection. Like, the hyperdrive battering ram fits into the terrorist narrative pretty cynically. And also, that's not the kind of warfare that is in the Star Wars toolkit. If you go down that road then unmanned hyperdrive ships become the default weapon of choice, right?\n\nAnyway, what do you guys think about all that.",

The movie's advocacy for a radical realism can be paralleled with Freud's materialism and his critique of religion in The Future of an Illusion.

Each movie was set and filmed nine years apart, focusing on two characters - Celine and Jesse, who meet randomly as strangers in the first movie and decide to explore Vienna for a day before Jesse flies back to the US. The series as a whole examines the relationship of these two as it changes over this time, how they develop over the years, and is really just a masterpiece by Linklater.\n\nOne of the things that moved me most, viewing the series as a whole, rather than individual movies, are the way the characters develop during the series. Look at how in Before Sunrise Jesse talks about how he hated that his parents only stayed together because of the kids, then in the Before Sunset he is living exactly this lie, and finally in Before Midnight we see that despite how their relationship is troubled, he will do everything he can to fight for his partner (Celine), eventually dropping the topic of moving to the US to live with his son Hank. \n\nI think the greatest connection between the three, however, is a certain non-verbal exchange the characters have. [This scene in Before Sunrise](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr03/2013/5/22/21/anigif_enhanced-buzz-27873-1369272516-0.gif?downsize=715:*&amp;output-format=auto&amp;output-quality=auto), Jesse wants to touch her hair, falling for her, but pulls back. In before Sunset, [This scene when Jesse is talking about his unhappy marriage, Celine is the one that wants to touch his hair, comfort him, but pulls back](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr06/2013/5/22/21/anigif_enhanced-buzz-28355-1369273031-0.gif?downsize=715:*&amp;output-format=auto&amp;output-quality=auto). But in the third, there is a distinct absence of such a scene. They are now two people that are in (admittedly) troubled love, in a relationship. No more hair touching. \n\nAside from wishing to spread my love of the trilogy a little bit further, I'm wondering if anyone knows of any other movies/series that do similar 'tricks' with their characters, or if anyone has any particularly interesting insights into this trilogy.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I know that this may feel like I'm making a joke about the title (get it?), but it strikes me that in the same way that It Follows is about promiscuity, ICAN is about nocturnal emissions and masturbation. I won't recap the film (currently streaming on Prime, fyi), and there will be spoilers below, so read at your own discretion.\n\nFirst, I should establish that I don't think it's \"about masturbation\" or anything so reductive. It just seems that this was a thematic element underlying the plot.\n\nIt Comes, is essentially a simple story, but there are some lingering details that give it depth. Clearly Travis is smitten with Kim (obviously the wet dream, the glances at her chest during their conversation, a lingering look as she throws her leg over her husband while sleeping, and the voyeurism of their intimacy). Travis is in that stage between boyhood and manhood, full of hormones and questions.\n\nAlso, the two indicators of infection are the eyes and hands. Checking hands is the odd thing, since we never see any wounds on the hands, but that's what is repeatedly checked and cleaned. Wash your hands and close your eyes are the most repeated lines of dialogue. \n\nGetting out on the skinnier branches, I'd also point at the scenes where Travis is facing the mirror (usually after having awoken in a sweat). His dry heaving and glassy look could also be construed as another event rather than hypochondria.\n\nConsider also the red door. It is somehow emblematic of the epidemic itself. Behind the bloody door is a thin veil. Perhaps I've got too much HR Giger on the brain, but I couldn't help but think it was a symbol for the vagina, complete with broken hymen.\n\nToo far? Anything to add?\n\nI get that most of you won't see this, but instead of saying that all these things \"don't matter\" is there anyway you can tie these details into something meaningful?\n\nAs a side discussion, I think it's pretty clear that Travis is the one who infected the house. I'd love to hear your pros and cons for this too.\n",

        "text": "Normally it's very easy for me to figure out if I like a film and if so, why. The 2000 film Battle Royale is one of the few exceptions where I don't know what to make of it or how to really explain it. I bloody like the film, like a whole lot, but I don't really enjoy what becomes the closest comparisons. I read the manga, which was probably the worst thing I've ever seen in the world. Hunger Games I despised more than I usually do boring crap YA films, and I don't really like the Takashi Miike/Sion Sono crazy violent edgefests either.\n\nThe gist of it is that I haven't really seen a satisfactory opinion that really nails why it's so good either (which does happen for most films). The most common describtion is that it's a \"satire\", which doesn't make any sense. A satire of what? Really violent Asian films? But it doesn't subvert or really comment on the violence in any way. A satire of how older Japanese generation view the younger? That doesn't make much sense either, since the viewpoints of the older generations are a very small aspect of the film. Even more so despite having several varkly humorous moments, the film is very sincere and straight forward about its characters. You are meant to care about them (though their love issues are meant to be seen as rather foolish and trivial) and when characters die it is meant as a tragedy, so I don't agree much about this reading.\n\nThe filmmaking is rather strange and haphazard, but fits fantastically well with the plotting, making many absurd moments feel very fitting. The actors are all very outward, extrovert and almost overdone which manages to fit with them all being awkward, vulnerable teenagers, adding a sense of desperation to everything, and the strange (I'd describe it as \"elevated B-movie\") filmmaking furthermore adds to the unpredictability of the story.\n\nAll in all though, it's very difficult to make sense of what the film is attempting to even be. It can be viewed as a straight up thriller but it's much more sincere about the naivety and vulnerability of its characters than these films typically are, rather than having to debase and lower themselves to the grueling awful level of the antagonists in order to escape, the main characters manage to come out of it seemingly innocent and unfased whereas we see the typical example mentioned above right in the opening scene. But it seems a bit disconnected to work as a commentary of that sort.\n\nTo be honest I'm just interested in other opinions on this film, because despite really liking it I don't know if I can make sense of it, or really exaplain satisfactorily why it's so good.",

For example, I was looking for clever shots, good use of the set, camera angles and movement, the actor’s performances. Should I take a step back from that and just try to immerse myself organically into the movie because I feel that this analysis might be detrimental to connecting with films on a purer emotional level. On first viewing, should you just let watch the film wash over you in a way? What is your “method”? \n\nLess related, but what do you like about Yojimbo? I’m curious, thanks!\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7o8zzz/mother_a_lucid_dream_experience/",
        "text": "Just saw mother!.  I went in knowing nothing other than what was depicted in trailers and posters.  Certainly not your typical movie.  I've seen a couple of Aronofsky's movies, to include Pi, Requiem, the Fountain, and Noah, so I had a decent idea as to what to expect.  I also did a search on this sub to check out some of the reactions when this came out in theaters, and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/70k8y2/just_watched_mother_and_im_shocked_by_how_heavy/) struck me as the most relevant to my own interpretation of the movie.  Finally, I'm aware of Aronofsky's views of the movie, that[ he wrote the screenplay in 5 days](http://entertainment.ie/cinema/news/Darren-Aronofsky-wrote-the-script-for-mother-in-five-days/397260.htm) and had been warning audiences not to over think the movie.  \n\nTaken as a lucid dream, IMHO it works.  As anything else, the logic falls apart, as do most dreams:\n\n- Is it a biblical allegory?  Sure, but only to a certain extent.  Yes, 'Adam' has a scar around his ribcage, and shortly after Eve appears and shatters the 'forbidden fruit' crystal.  They fuck and all of a sudden full grown Cain and Abel appear with the former killing the latter.  Then more people appear, Adam and Eve disappear, utter mayhem ensues, and then there's the 'flood of fire' with mother doing a hard reset of God's creation...except it's not the flood, but rather some sort of Nietzschean eternal recurrence going on.  Or, considering Aronofsky has been influenced by Buddhism in other movies, perhaps the anthropomorphic mother nature is experiencing reincarnation?  Whatever it is, the biblical allegory falls apart here...there's no judgment day after Christ gets eaten.  Instead, God tries again, because God just can't get it right in this movie.\n\n- Does it contain an environmentalist message?  Sure, but to whatever extent that vision gets the limelight, the biblical allegory gets the shaft.  The Bible has zero relevance to the environmentalist theme of man destroying nature.  \n\n- Why is 'Adam' an orthopedic surgeon?  What relevance does that have to do with anything?  When viewing the movie, this detail threw me off more than anything, because I expected the characters depicted to be what they said they were, so an orthopedic surgeon with his worldly wife doing an AirBnB of sorts with a popular author and his sensitive wife.  It wasn't until the baby got eaten towards the end of the movie that I let go of this interpretation.  It took something that shocking for me to not take this movie literally, because, like many lucid dreams, there were a lot of extraneous details that didn't mean anything to each other that were littered in this movie.  \n\n- Michelle Pfeiffer's Eve was incredibly menacing and a wonderfully compelling character; I expected her to play a larger role in what occurred in the movie, but her and Ed Harris simply vanished about 2/3 of the way into the movie without any explanation, which again makes sense if taken as a lucid dream, but only because such dreams don't make a lot of sense to begin with.  In regards to telling a cohesive story, this is a dangling detail that never gets answered...that characters who take so much screentime just disappear leaving audiences to fill in the gaps as to what occurred.\n\n- What did the sink not being braced have to do with anything?  Why isn't the house finished?  Didn't God rest on the Sabbath after he was *done* with creation?\n\n- edit - ah, I almost forgot one more detail.  Why is mother nature played as a naive young wife?  I mean, her heart is 'literally' the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  mother nature should be as wise as God himself, as it's through consumption of this fruit that Man became like God, knowing good from evil. - end edit\n\n---\n\nAnyway, some other aspects:\n\n- The cinematography was interesting, but the hand-held or shaky cam was extremely and unnecessarily disorienting.  It cheapened the experience IMHO and really hammered home to me that this movie was made on the fly with a screenplay that took 5 days to write.  \n\n- IMHO the theme of the artist's dilemma comes out a lot stronger than whatever Aronofsky intended with this film.  Is art meant to please the artist?  Or is it, like what Stephen King writes in his book On Writing, a matter of having it resonate with audiences?  In this movie, the artist has his cake and eats it too, as the artist creates his audience, and so the ego-driven act of creating also satisfies the desires of 'others', if the people in the movie can be somehow considered independent of their creator.  The 'consequence' is that his 'wife', who the artist also created, has a nervous breakdown and breaks everything.  Does that even matter though, considering the creator can just remake his wife again?  IMHO this interpretation cheapens the movie and makes it out to be a form of artistic wish fulfillment than any sort of realistic dilemma an artist would actually face.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I can understand the feverish pursuit to try to capture the potential essence of a dream and to attach significance to the experience, but for me at least, most of my dreams don't amount to shit, and unfortunately, as well-acted and as presentable as this film for the most part is, it suffers from it being a depiction of something incoherent and ultimately surface-deep.  There was so much potential here, but it just didn't add up...or to whatever extent it did amount to something, it was shallow and cheap.\n\nI found Noah and the Fountain to be more meaningful, tightly scripted, and ultimately more enjoyable.  I've seen both of those movies multiple times, the Fountain more than a dozen.  mother! I don't see myself bothering with a re-watch.\n\ngrammar edits",

        "text": "*The Witch* details how Thomasin, an adolescent girl in Puritan New England, sells her soul to the devil and becomes a witch.  As her family moves into the wilderness away from civilization, misfortune after misfortune befalls the family and Thomasin finds herself under increasing suspicion from her mom and dad.  There's also her burgeoning female adulthood and sexuality that causes further suspicion to fall on her.  Eventually her family is killed off and with her being the only one left, instead of returning to mainstream Puritan society, Thomasin instead opts to become a witch and see the world as the devil promises her.  And this movie was been praised as being an example of feminist horror that shows a young woman rejecting society and their restrictions on her movement and sexuality in order to live eternally free, and I want to pose a different viewpoint to *The Witch*.\n\n*The Witch* is a story about witches under the command of the devil who manipulate events and prey on a family until the only person left is Thomasin, who has little choice but to become a witch for survival.  One thing that I think is overlooked in reviews of the movies is that **Thomasin looks guilty**.  Baby Samuel goes missing when she's watching him and no one else sees what happens.  William and the horse go missing when they're out in the woods hunting with Thomasin, and Thomasin is the one who finds him and brings him back, after which he shortly dies after speaking blasphemous-sounding poetry.  Thomasin then is locked in with the twins in the barn and watches as a witch takes them away.  Her parents open the barn only to find her.  Strip away the setting and even Thomasin's gender and it looks like something's up with her as these strange disappearances occur only when she's alone with someone and she never has a legitimate explanation for these events.  \n\nThat's because Thomasin's being set up.  Only when her entire family is dead, and it looks like Thomasin's choices lie between starving to death alone or going back to Puritan society to be hanged does the devil reveal himself.  To me, his behavior with Thomasin in that scene was very predatory and had a sexually charged air when he says \"I will guide your hand [to sign your name]\" as he has Thomasin remove her clothes and he places his hand on her shoulder.  So Thomasin \"signs her name\" in the devil's book and rejects Puritan patriarchy...in exchange for eternal life as the servant of a male.  She exchanges one patriarchy for another.   \n\nWhy isn't this part of the movie talked about more or I am way off the mark with this analysis?  Let me know!  ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7o7bft/juno_2007_and_the_big_sick_2017_some_thoughts/",
        "text": "I have been wanting to make this post ever since I got the chance to see The Big Sick, earlier during the holiday break. I *really* liked the movie and had a great time watching it. Reflecting on the movie, I couldn't help but feel that it is really similar to Juno. So here, I will address some key elements that I believe these two movies share, just to get these thoughts out of my head and maybe end up hearing other interesting opinions on the subject. Who knows? \n\n\nTo begin, you could categorize these two films as romantic comedies, and you would be correct, partially though. Even though all the characteristics of a typical rom-com have made their way into both films, there is so much more underneath. More than the witty humor and smart, fast-paced dialogue and the moments of true dramatic tension. The two movies have achieved something much bigger than being great, refreshing romantic comedies. They have managed to pick up two delicate, sensitive and taboo subjects (teen pregnancy and abortion / culture clash and generation gap) and display them from a truly unique and humane perspective. It is truly mind-boggling for an outsider of the Muslim culture, to see Kumail having to sit through tons of meaningless family dinners with Pakistani girls. He can't tell his mother about his American girlfriend and her health problems, because that will automatically lead to his banning from the family. He is not as religious as his more traditional family, and tries to keep one foot in the Pakistani/Muslim culture and another in his own system of beliefs. Likewise, Juno is (in the begging of the film) in the moral dilemma of having an abortion or keeping the baby. By no means she is equipped or mature enough to make this decision. She only decides to keep the baby when a schoolmate of hers informs her that the baby already grows fingernails, and the story goes on from there. Tons of different groups of people voice their opinions about teen pregnancy and abortions, from religious people to scientists etc. It is a really clever move from the writer, that Juno's decision is finally shaped thanks to her sixteen year old classmate. They have purposefully overlooked all the taboos and the controversy that surround the particular subject, not supporting anyone's side but Juno's. They approach the whole subject from a more playful and \"comedic\" perspective than it is commonly used to. However, the movie has wonderfully managed to capture a brilliant and refreshingly new perspective on teenage pregnancy and abortion. Thanks to Ellen Page's great acting skills, we slowly get to discover Juno's deep feelings and the bond she develops with her child, hidden under her hip dialect and seemingly tough attitude.\n\n\nNext, I couldn't believe how exceptionally written were the supporting roles of the parents in both films. A particular scene comes to mind from Juno. It is the scene in which we are first introduced to Juno's parents, and the scene where she informs them about her pregnancy. In any other similar movie, the parents would probably freak out and throw a tantrum for the sake of \"comedy\". That is not the case in this movie, where the parents are wiser and more realistically portrayed than parents are in other comedies. The scene ends with Juno's father and stepmother. \"You know it wasn't his idea\", says she. He silently nods agreeingly. What a cliche-breaking introduction for Juno's parents. Parents in both movies are crucial to the plot development. Their characters are much more important than other \"similar\" movies allow them to be. They are not always in frame, but you always have the feeling that the events that are happening are affecting not only the protagonists, but them as well. Since the stories focus on Juno and Kumail - Emily in the films, nothing is known about the parents when they enter the frame, except from very little things. Another noteworthy thing is the dynamics between Emily's parents, and their relationship with Kumail. We are always hinted towards some kind of rivalry between these two. Their characters are extremely different, they cope with the situation in different ways, they disagree with each other a lot. We star wondering if there is something else brewing under the surface. Emily's mother is a very dynamic and powerful presence in the screen, and we can see the fear and anxiety she evokes to Kumail. However, slowly, frame by frame as she develops her character further into the movie, we get a glimpse of her real self, for instance when she defends Kumail from a racist in the audience, or when she stress-eats with him, talking about various topics. This is a very clever way to tell the audience that the characters we see are affected by the unfolding events, and their behavior changes likewise throughout the film's duration. The secondary characters - the parents have much more going on than we see. They are not there only to help push the story forward, they contribute majorly to the movie. They are as real as real-life parents.\n\n\nSo, I hoped you enjoyed reading this. It is probably filled with syntax, vocabulary and grammatical errors since I haven't written anything in English for a while now, sorry about that. I haven't covered all the stuff that I found common in the two movies, only the most \"crucial\" ones, as I didn't want the post to drag for too long. Last but not least, I would love to hear your opinions on the matter as well!\n\n\nedit: formatting",

        "text": "(I had written this as a comment to a post about Shakespeare on film, but that post was deleted before I had finished commenting. I wanted to post it here because the topic of literary adaptations is something I'm really interested in, and I'd love to see your guys' takes.)\n\nI think we ought to call it all Shakespeare, in the same way we give Orson Welles credit for The Magnificent Ambersons even though it was heavily altered by the studio. But I also think that film doesn't necessarily distort a play that heavily; a play on film can still retain its fundamental characteristics.\n\nFor instance, in his Hamlet, Kenneth Branagh intentionally uses long takes that frequently circle around the actors in order to give the audience a feeling that we're in the scene itself, but merely as observers. We're supposed to feel like we're watching the events take place as they happen, not (for the most part) being presented with one director's viewpoint. In doing so, he transplants the audience to a new physical location vis a vis the scene, but he doesn't change the underlying role of the audience; we still have to find our own meaning in the scenes.\n\nIt helps that Branagh keeps the text intact, though some deletions (very common in theater) don't necessarily hurt. Zeffereli's Hamlet uses a pared-down, stagey castle to represent the action and gives us the feeling of watching a play while still cutting the dialogue way back to alter the pacing and provide a tenser experience.\n\nBranagh's Henry V also toys with the text of the play. He actually inserts a few scenes from earlier plays into his film, but in Shakespeare's era the audience would have almost certainly been familiar with the character of Falstaff, and so when he's referenced in Henry V they'd know what's going on. A modern audience can't be expected to have that same context, so Branagh reinserts it for our benefit.\n\nCompare those to something like the Hollow Crown's take on Richard III. There, the director repeatedly uses montage to give a sense of the location and to set a sinister tone, but he also cuts the text back so much that it changes the emotional arc of the play. He deletes the scene with the two assassins entirely, because its (darkly) comic tone would conflict with the brutality with which he's trying to portray the murder. But that scene provides the playwright's discussion of the ethical issues in the play, and it foreshadows the hellish curses placed upon Richard III in the end. It gets to the very heart of the play, and by removing it the director is changing the play into something very different: a shocking, contemporary palace intrigue.\n\nChimes at Midnight, like Branagh's Henry V, integrates multiple plays into one film, but Welles is doing it to refocus the action on the character of Falstaff, and in doing so creates a totally different story. Similarly, in Radford's Merchant of Venice, the director inserts title cards explaining contemporaneous antisemitism and uses the camera to show haunting scenes of Shylock's exclusion from Jewish society, which gives the film a very different tone and re-purposes the text as historical commentary.\n\nNone of these changes are necessarily bad. But some of these films are trying to communicate what Shakespeare communicated, and some of them are trying to communicate what the director wants to say. I think that should be our red line for what makes a film \"Shakespeare.\"",

However, I feel John Stahls (Ben Stiller) addiction in David Veloz's Biography/ Drama Permanent Midnight represents something deeper: The Escape of an Outsider\n\n[SPOILERS] Skip to end of spoilers if you don't want plot details.\n\nThroughout the film John shows his growing depression, not due to the drugs but rather due to the lack of fulfilment he's getting out of his success in the entertainment business as a comedy writer for \"Mr Chompers\" (fictionalised version of Alf). It is made clear that such a job is beneath his capabilities particularly when the interviewer and boss for the job asks John if his:\n\n\"mind can function down at our level\"\n\nAlso during his intoxicated 'Realism is Dead' rant, John still makes valid points concerning a shows success and connectivity to the audience and provides expressionism as an alternative with his co-worker baffled stating:\n\n\"Im just a product of public education. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.\"\n\n[END OF SPOILERS]\n\nOverall I believe John to be working on a whole other plain of thought, representing the often true nature of show business' over saturation of work too concerned with mass public approval. John may have a needle in his arm half the time but it's because he can't stand the mind numbing bore of conformity in the business.\n\nAre there other films about outsiders who are misunderstood but with good intentions?",

        "text": "**An overlong, \"ELI5\" explanation on why I consider this - and other miniseries and TV movies - as films along their theatrical counterparts.** \n\n**Sorry if it sounds a bit \"over-amplified\" or over-explanatory. I did this for a class, and straight-up copied it.**\n\nThe most absurd assumption made about films? That they're only one to four hours long. If you were to do a quick Google search, you would learn that there is a plethora of films out there that are five hours or longer. Many of them, actually, never even had theatrical screenings. Why are they considered \"films\"? The question is one that is often brought up; with an unspoken rule of what constitutes one taking over in contemporary film culture. According to Wikipedia, if we really want to label something of a definition on \"film\", it's mostly surrounding the idea of a moving image. Frames per second, creating the illusion of movement over a period of time. But then, following the discovery of film, we have also been faced with new platforms – and other medium forms – of the moving image. The television series, the documentary, the music video, the video game, the short film, the YouTube video, and the list goes on, and on, and on. What do we do to actually make \"film\" a stipulated term? The thing is, there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.  \n\nAccording to the rules of AMPAS (the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), the Academy Awards have a strict guideline on what is eligible for their awards every year. One, the film must be screened entirely in its completed length. Two, the film must screen, at the very least, in one of the major cities (Los Angeles or New York City, most specifically) for an alotted period of time. Three, they must be feature-length – so longer than, let's say, an hour? Four, the film must have been theatrically screened, first and foremost, before any other means of presentation. This last rule was actually responsible for Linda Fiorentino never getting her Oscar nomination for *The Last Seduction*. She received rave reviews for her performance in the film, and was generally talked about for the awards season. Unfortunately, the film was screened on television before its theatrical release, causing it to be ineligible. It was now a TV movie that went to theaters.  \n\nBut these little things are the major – not to mention, inconsistent – rules that plague the cinephile's definition of \"film\". In 2017, *Twin Peaks: The Return* started cracking best of the year lists with many publications. And not just for television – we're talking film, with *Cahiers du Cinema* and *Sight &amp; Sound* both having it at the very top of their lists. There was an uproar of dismissals and disagreements from film communities. Many of which were irritated by the film critics not allowing television to \"excel\" in a new creative way without it having to be \"validated\" by calling it a \"film\" instead. Others just disagreed completely with thinking through on it: it was on television, so it's not a film. David Lynch, however, was pretty vocal. He called it a film. Not only did he have that printed, but [the credits after every episode during the series says \"this film...\" and \"motion picture\" in reference to anything involving its production](https://imgur.com/a/Y3kI7).\n\nIs *Twin Peaks: The Return* a film, or a television series? In terms of \"film\" as a definition, it is. When applying the auteur theory founded by Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut, we can also attribute a stark difference between the mediums of film and television – the latter in which mixed the concepts of both theater and film in order to present us with the sitcom and others during its Golden Age. In case of *Twin Peaks: The Return*, it's like any other TV movie or miniseries. They're films. They're made by the same collective group of people. They're moving images underneath the auteur theory. Something could be 100 hours long, and it still wouldn't change the fact it’s a 100-hour long film. Other than, if you're on that side, it premieres on television. They're films that were presented on a different platform. It doesn't make them any lesser, or more, than anything else. It's not robbing television. There's a vast difference between singular entities and shows that span – and are produced – without an ending even ready.  \n\nI'll take you to some other examples of miniseries and TV movies that often crack lists of the best \"films\". Krzysztof Kieslowski's *Dekalog* is one – a ten-episode piece that even received a Criterion release this past year. Some of Bergman's films: *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander* were edited *from* miniseries into their feature-length cuts (he prefers you watching the miniseries versions, if that gives you an idea of why he went there with it.) \n\nFassbinder had *Berlin Alexanderplatz* and *World on a Wire* - both of which were miniseries that never got theatrical cuts, and both frequent lists of the best films. Nobody bats an eye, because they're the auteurs behind them to \"justify\". Some have argued this is the only reason Lynch has had the same treatment. I believe that's partially true. I think this is something in need of more focus and \"closure\", but naturally the big dogs are going to make it easier for some to be on-board. Now, all we need is to embrace the smaller ones (Mike Nichols' *Angels in America* is a strong example) that deserve the same amount of clout and research as the auteur counterparts.  \n\nLet's propose this idea, for a second. Why *have* auteurs such as Bergman and Lynch gone to television for their work? Not only they and Fassbinder or Kieslowski have – nor just Nichols. There's also Orson Welles – whose last film *The Immortal Story* was also a television production. It also has a Criterion release. But for some reason, TV movie seems to be more forgivable by most detractors of the *Twin Peaks: The Return* statement. It may have to do, again, with the random (although understandable) bias on the exact \"runtime\" of a film. If *The Return* hadn't been 18 hours long, would the reaction be as overwhelmingly negative for its inclusion? Something tells me if the HBO movie *Wit* cracked their list, they wouldn't be as confrontational on it (it was on Ebert's top 10 of 2001, but nobody cared). There is no cap on how long a film can be – only the limitations that have been placed on them by the studios. Nobody wants to sit in a theater for longer than three hours, and even that's pushing it for them. Especially today. That's the only reason we have a \"set\" runtime for films, and why *Transformers* has permission to be three hours long. Money talks. \n \nUsually, we haven't any set rules on what makes a work *this* or *that*. Oddly enough, there still seems to be one that's formed in the public opinion (and again, it all connects back to AMPAS rules; even the majority of the same people follow U.S. release dates for something's year, just like the Academy.) For example, with *The Last Seduction*, it was declined for Oscar consideration because it premiered on television first. Would we now consider it a TV movie? Add onto this, an amazing example of a film that almost \"wasn't\" (by certain perspectives): *Slumdog Millionaire*. The winner of the Best Picture Oscar in 2008? Yeah. It was supposed to go direct-to-DVD. If it had, it wouldn't even be considered a \"film\" by most. But it's a Best Picture winner. Think on that for a bit, and whether or not a certain platform defines a piece of work as \"this and only this\".  \n\n(It's too broad – too grey - for that kind of certainty. It's like the criticisms of *Twin Peaks* being a collection of its own individual episodes, when *The Lords of the Rings* films were filmed similarly and split into three – but again, a theater screen makes a world of difference, I guess.)  \n\nWhich also brings to mind one of the weirdest thoughts I've had about this in relation to \"what comes first\". Many theatrical releases go onto television later. Sometimes, even quick. Likewise, they go to physical media. Does the perception change for them as well? How are they remaining of their original platform without anything to differentiate? You can drive yourself crazy pondering this stuff, but most of all, it comes down to neither those against it nor for it being wrong. There's nothing of validation, and – sorry – but \"unspoken rules\" don't cut it. Especially when they're cut from the cloth of awards bodies. \n\n*Twin Peaks: The Return* is no different than any other miniseries, to me. In fact, the avoidance of being \"season three\" is the cherry on top of this viewpoint. If *Fire Walk with Me* was a theatrical prequel to the first two seasons, then *The Return* is the 18-hour epilogue. They're both films. The first two seasons are not (except for the pilot, which was a film in Europe, which can cause you to panic even more when it comes to solidifying your stuff on this shit.)\n\nUntil then, yes: *Twin Peaks: The Return* is my choice for the best film of 2017.",

        "text": "I'm somewhat new to all of this. Curious to see if others have a similar understanding of the film:\n\n*The humanity of Michael Mann’s noirish yet contemporary Thief becomes apparent once Frank presents his collage to a startled Jessie during the film’s famous diner scene. Prior scenes establish Frank as a man of exacting precision, one who seemingly never relinquishes control over his emotional or physical well-being. The collage functions as both a revelation for Jessie and the viewer; Frank’s identity can’t solely be defined by the work he does. Yet while serving time he’s seen exactly as that: a thief and a murderer. For Frank, time is literally of the essence. The decade he spent in a prison robbed him of precious time to develop an authentic persona.\n\n*At its core, Thief is a film about revelations. Frank’s collage consists of cutouts from magazines and fragments of popular culture which represent an idealized form of American life. Mann has gone on record about the thematic importance of the collage in [a wide-ranging interview with Bilge Ebiri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QtAbxh7shw) (part in question starts at 11:02 and ends at 14:41). The collage functions as a symbol of Frank’s illusory tendencies, which developed as a result of his incarceration. Leo and company offer Frank the illusion of family after Okla’s demise. But what exactly happens once Frank attempts to detach from Leo’s crew? Leo murders Barry, a true member of Frank’s “family,” and threatens to destroy whatever familial relationships remain. In reality, Leo views Frank as neither a friend nor family, but simply a thief. The adoption of nihilism is a consequence of Frank’s revelation regarding Leo’s (and to an extent the world’s) true perception of him. \n\n*Frank’s destruction of all that he cares for demonstrates his new understanding of reality. If life is a series of revealed truths, then does he actually possess any semblance of control over it? The Frank which the viewer first encounters has predicated his entire worldview on the notion of control. Total socio-economic independence, what Frank desires the most, is an illusion in corporatized America. Frank’s plight is an indictment of an American culture where one’s social worth is cultivated by their occupation, rather than their values or ideals. Mann’s title reveals all: this isn’t the tribulations of Frank, but the tribulations of a thief.\n\n",

        "text": "Humans crave certainty and comfort; we're drawn towards things that make us feel safe.  Our brains are constantly working to recognize patterns in the world we observe around us.  And that's a very good thing- to always be drawn towards the risky and unknown would be to invite a quick and certain extinction.  But sometimes, our natural penchant for a sort of cozy orderliness can have some downsides, and in no place is this more apparent than the box office.  I'm willing to garner that if you're reading this right now, you're not a huge fan of the seemingly inescapable glut of sequels, reboots and comic-book adaptations indundanting the pop cultural landscape.  It seems as if every other post here is a reactionary screed warning against the infiltration of this subreddit by nefarious SUPERHERO MOVIE POSTS.  Like rats squeezing into your crawl-space, posts with titles like \"Where DC movies can excel\" and \"Why You Hate The Last Jedi For All The Wrong Reasons\" are impossible to prevent from cropping up from time to time (to make no mention of the veritable cesspool that is most movie subreddits).  \n\nBut it's worth mentioning that the sickening banality of online film discussion obfuscates the fact that for most of American cinematic history, mass audiences have gravitated towards the safe and predictable.  Outside of the coveted New Hollywood years, popular movies mostly consisted of cheap thrills and laughs.  This is the whole reason genres exist. They give us a template that makes sense.  They strive for predictability.  They attempt to comfort.  They wanna be safe.\n\nThey're just like us.   \n\nSo it's logical that genres are also ridiculously limiting. It's an inescapable fact that when you're working within the stylistic and narrative confines of a pre-established \"type\" of movie, the possibilities are severely narrowed.  The best filmmakers can push the envelope pretty far, but the overwhelming majority of these movies are destined to quickly fade away from memory, passing through our system quicker than a cup of high-fiber cereal.  \n\nSlasher movies can only ever be slasher movies.  Westerns are westerns.  Rom-coms, disaster movies, spy movies, heists?  Been there, done that.  Most of the Marvel movies are actually pretty well-made, but it's almost impossible for them to really be engaging at this point because it all feels so stale.  No matter how much superhero movies try to be different, they all have to conform to that same basic structure we all know and love... (to begrudgingly tolerate, because good LORD these movies continue to rake in cash by the truckload even though everyone seems to agree that they're all laughably forgettable).  \n\nSo most of us have drawn a line in the sand.  HERE are thought-provoking, artistic films, we tell ourselves.  And THERE are genre films.  Genre movies are inert and derivative; incapable of providing anything deeper than some visceral excitement and escapism.  Most cinephiles' favorite genre works are ones that seem to actively eschew and subvert their supposed categorical shell, or at the very least suppress it in exchange for a robust, auteurist directorial vision. Hardly anyone would say that \"Pulp Fiction\" is great because it's a great gangster movie.  It's a great TARANTINO movie.  Leone's \"Dollars Trilogy\" isn't fantastic because the movies kicked off the spaghetti western craze (on the contrary, they're just about the only good stuff in a genre that's 99% dog shit); they're anchored in the director's unique and haunting take on the mythology of the American west- a deconstruction of a genre that had been prominent for decades.   There's probably hundreds of gangster movies and westerns that aim for Leone and Tarantino and don't even come close\n\nAnd there are good genre movies that embrace their simplicity too. Nor irony, no subversion- just clean, old-fashioned fun.  But in my mind, the best genre films are the ones that embrace their limitations and engage with them in meaningful ways.  \n\nPerhaps the best-known example of this rift is Edgar Wright.  Wright's work is so synonymous with trite geek movie culture that his films are basically coming-of-age rituals for aspiring zero-calorie cinephiles.  Watching \"Hot Fuzz\" for the first time is like a redditor's Bar Mitzvah!! \n\nBut removed from its space within the collective cultural consciousness, Wright's Cornetto Trilogy is great examples of a filmmaker using genre in a way that's both satisfying and resonant.  \"Shaun of the Dead\" is a zombie movie that functions as a perfect treatise on being a directionless young man and having to come to grow up and be responsible and take charge.  It's a movie brimming with a sort of compassionate humanism, where there's actually a point to it all- a point that delves deeper into the human condition than a mere \"watch out! the zombies are gonna eat you!\" (although there's plenty of that as well).  \n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" was a buddy cop movie about, well, being buddies.  It was about as profound an exploration of friendship as we've been treated to on screen in the 21st century.  It takes a cliche-ridden, hackneyed genre and uses it as a vessel for its more poignant emotional core.  \"The World's End\" does as well.  Hell, \"Scott Pilgrim\" is a silly, video game-y live action superhero cartoon that is profound because it marinates all those elements in the sort of pathos they're usually lacking.  Of COURSE Scott is like a superhero, because youthful romance feels like being a superhero (or at least it does to Scott). Of course his life is a video-game, because he's unable to see grasp nuance since he's a naive man-child (That's why it's so great that the end of the movie is him NOT FIGHTING MEGA-SCOTT!!! He finally learns to eschew the silly Manichaeism he's allowed to dominate his actions so far and he actually changes!! This is what storytelling is all about!!)  \n\nFor all their flaws, these are movies that wear their hearts on their sleeves, injecting their genres with some substance while still embracing all their idiosyncrasies.  \n\nAnd that's why I found \"Baby Driver\" so disappointing.  It's a fun, hyper-stylized romp, and it's certainly quirky, but is there anything beneath the flashy surface?  Is Baby Driver actually ABOUT anything meaningful?  I would argue it's not.  It's Wright coasting on fumes.\n\nBut perhaps the most fascinating hidden gem of genre cinema of the 2000s is Rian Johnson's \"Brick.\"  Unlike the Zombie movie, or the Buddy cop movie, or the comic-book superhero movie, \"hard boiled film noir\" wasn't exactly lighting up megaplexes.  And neither were high school dramas.  But Johnson did something weird.  He made a hard boiled film noir set in a high school.  The tortured, loner detective?  Joseph-Gordon Levitt's tortured loner.  Femme Fatale?  Popular rich girl.  Corrupt official?  Loudmouthed vice principal.  \n\nIt's precisely the sort of genre-mashup trash one would expect to end up in the dumpster, right next to \"Cowboys and Aliens.\"  And yet, \"Brick\" was enthralling.  Underneath the Dassin-esque dialogue and anime influenced visuals was a film that crackled with the sort of adolescent creative energy you rarely see presented without a drop of irony.  And it didn't have to be ironic, because it made sense.  Even with all that absurdity, it made total sense. \n\nBecause when you're in high school, of course your life is noir.  You can't trust anyone.  Everyone is hiding things from you.  Everyone is out to get you.  Authority figures are buffoonish and incompetent; your crushes are manipulative and unattainable.  There's a permanent fog of angst.  Johnson did what so many directors won't- he captures it all.  Not by pitifully attempting to mimic teen slang, or try hard to be real, or doe-eyed sentimentalism.  But through genre.  \n\nI could write another thousand words on \"Looper,\" but I'll refrain from doing so because this post is already way too long.  But I'll briefly touch on Johnson's most recent (and already his most controversial) work:  Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  \n\nI don't really want to talk about the movie in great depth, as that's been done by just about everyone on the internet.  But for me, it's clear that \"The Last Jedi\" is the first time since 1977 that a Star Wars movie has actually had something to say.  Johnson took George Lucas' off the chain hybrid of soap opera and samurai and fairy tale and used it to its fullest potential. Like Leone's Spaghetti Westerns or Wright's zombie movie or Johnson's own Orange County Film Noir, here, the genre wasn't an obstacle to bold storytelling; it was a receptacle.  \n\nHe used it to say something.  Something that went deeper than the light-dark morality at the heart of big budget spectacle.  A meditation on the tension between our need for legends and myths and the ways those legends and myth constrain and reduce us.  Something that struggled with and eventually embraced the paradoxical duality at the center of the meaning of legends and heroes. \n\nI don't know, it's just food for thought.  This probably comes across as the incoherent ravings of a lunatic, but hopefully there's something in here that can spark conversation.  \n\n\n\n\n",

I just finished reading an older script of The God Particle(the new Cloverfield movie) and it was terribly written though the story is quite good.\n\nSo my question is, is there any website dedicated to screenplays of films? I'd really love to start reading screenplays. Also, what are the best screenplays you have read in literary form like that? Any suggestions are welcome. I know that a simple google search will probably yield results but I want to know if truefilm has any suggestions about screenplays I should read.",
