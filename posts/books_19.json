The atmosphere is right, and there are real monsters.\" \n\nBecause the zone habitable by humans is 'relatively narrow' (5% closer in and farther out than Earth's current orbit would provide 50 million times the surface area of Earth), the disc (and the cost of its construction) could be shared with aliens from hotter and colder planets. Over long periods of time, lifeforms would evolve to settle the sparsely-inhabited regions in between. \"If civilization should fall, things could get eerie and interesting.\" \n\nHas anyone written a sword and sorcery novel set on Alderson Disk or this is yet to be done?",

I chose to read this book off my bookshelf because the author’s name was super cool, the cover was neat, and the title was intriguing and also mentioned God. For some reason after I lost my memory I somehow became religious/spiritual (no I am not making that up lol) so the God part appealed to me. I had no idea what the novel was about though at the time lol.\n\nSo if you lost your memory of every book you’ve ever read, which book on the bookshelf would appeal the most? What would make it appealing? The title? The cover? The length? Your inexplicable newfound interest in religion and spirituality? Something else?",

        "text": "I really love The Forgotten Beasts of Eld so I thought I would try another of Patricia A McKillip's books but Od Magic is just weird. The FBofE is floaty but it's a complete book with an understandable storyline. Od Magic introduces too many characters too quickly and hints at things that then never make sense. Also I despise when a book doesn't make sense within its rules and Od Magic definitely doesn't. The king is all powerful and afraid of any magic he doesn't understand but there doesn't seem to be any organization about how to stop other magic users. \nThere's a magician Tirramen who may or may not use magic, no one knows, and the king's best option is to send one guard in to see if they would have trouble arresting him. There is no investigation into whether or not he has magic, just oh maybe we need to arrest him so see how we would do that. Most of the other wizards don't like the rules on magic at all and in fact often disagree with them entirely but even though it's made clear multiple times that regular people can't stop wizards, they follow them? \nThe one wizard who does like the rules seems to have never considered that there could be any other kinds of magic even though technically his job is I guess to protect the king from outside magic.\n All of the women in the book seem to have jobs and free will, there's no mention of male superiority but the princess is not expected or allowed to have an opinion on who she marries or what she does with her life. \nPeople in the book jump to wild conclusions with almost no evidence. Deciding that just because the princess is missing for a night she's been kidnapped by the gardener who they all think is Tirramen even though multiple characters agree that he isn't. \nAnd last but definitely the worst. The Twilight District. It's a whole section of the city that the king is afraid of because there may or may not be uncontrolled magic present. But once again there is nothing working against this. The District stays open as usual, the king doesn't ban anything that's happening there. Once long ago some student wizards got together there and tried to overthrow the rules on magic so no student wizard was ever allowed to go there again? If you're found there you're expelled and then sent home trusted not to learn other magic from somewhere else, for some reason? When it's made blatantly obvious that most people can just learn some kind of magic without any teachers whatsoever. \nBut the absolute worst is that for a large portion of the book the Twilight District is completely cut off from the rest of the city and everyone is ok with it. No one is allowed in or out for multiple days and there's no riots in the streets from people who can't get home or to work ECT. No one talks about the huge loss of tourism money, they even block off part of the river, which in any trading city would be really bad for the economy. \n\nOd Magic is a beautifully described book and the idea is awesome but it also feels like a threaded together mess that didn't have much if any for thought put into it.",

        "text": "So I posted about this book when I was half way through. I’ll start with bitching about what I didn’t like, then go into what I loved. I mildly bitched about Bradbury’s writing style, and have to do so again. \n\nThe last part..his style kills the tension a lot of times. I’ve grown to like it. But it’s not conducive to dread. When I finished I realized I* fucked up. It’s a coming of age story. I was reading it like it’s “the thing” of movie horror brilliance. Realize when I criticize a lot comes from that. \n\nI expected a existential horror which, the merri go round did! Trapped. The Mr. Cooger part was my favorite. It kinda climaxes midway through the book. What really gets me is Charles character. He goes on these philosophical rants, and I dig, but no one talks like that. I do appreciate him asking the boys about it in the library, the pondering of an old man. Reminds me of my pops. \n\nLong story short. The ending sucked IMO. The power of love..I’ve probably read too many stories with that as the end all be all. Mr. Darks death was so..like dumb. He got hugged to death? I understand the idea, I just thought it was..anticlimactic. Same with the smile on the bullet. The idea was good, it just didn’t mesh welll. \n\nThe good: \n\nMr.Dark is legit a great creepy character. I loved how I originally thought this and confirmed later that his tattoos are trapped souls. What a great idea.\n\nThe sense of fear is well done bc “there’s some people coming after me” and I like how Charles believes them. I love his musings of getting old, even if Bradbury embellishes it a bit much. \n\nMy favorite part is the first merri go round. It’s fucking amazing. \n\nI like the little twist at the end, though I saw it coming miles away. I also thought it was a cool metaphor about “cheap tricks”. Like when Charles talks about the rubber bullet idea, I think it kinda is self referencing. Which works bc it’s not obvious.",

        "text": "“The flight from the USSR” is the first short novel by the Georgian author David Turashvili. It is his romanticized retelling of the events that occurred in 1983 when 7 young Georgians, amongst them physicians, a painter, and a young actor along with his pregnant wife, all of them known and loved in their communities, attempted to hijack a plane in order to escape the Soviet Union, with the final goal of reaching the perceived freedom offered by the Western world, away from the unbearable constraints of the Soviet regime, during the times when even the thought of escaping the Soviet Union was considered to be a crime.\n\nThe failure of the attempt resulted in the arrests and subsequent executions of the hijackers, the deaths of three crew members, two passengers, and a total of 108 bullet holes in the plane, when the Georgian Communist Party Chief sanctioned the storming of the plane by the elite Soviet Special unit.\n\nWhether you finish the book to consider them to be ordinary domestic terrorists, fighters for freedom, or just either the victims or the perpetrators of their times, this book masterfully encompasses the desperation, valor, and naivety born of the ceaseless desire for freedom that directly opposes the ruthless brutality of the Soviet regime.\n\nConsidering how little attention Georgian literature gets worldwide, I would like to recommend this relatively short but poignant book to everyone interested in grasping the general feeling of the soviet times in occupied Georgia. ",

        "text": " i finished  \"stillness is the key by Ryan Holiday yesterday. below are what i learned from it.  1. wishing good will even to people who wound our inner child 2. avoid expressing anger by taking time to calm down or avoiding situations and people who irritate us 3. “It is true that relationships take time. They also expose and distract us, cause pain, and cost money. We are also nothing without them” “A good relationship requires us to be virtuous, faithful, present, empathetic, generous, open. “ it was an important lesson because i though a good relationship was a perfect relationship where no one feel pain even one time. 4. “And It’s been said that the word “love” is spelled T-I-M-E. It is also spelled W-O-R-K and S-A-C-R-I-F-I-C-E and D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T-Y, C-O-M-M-I-T-M-E-N-T, But it is always punctuated by R-E-W-A-R-D. Even ones that end” I never loved someone truly, so it taught me how love works. 5. If you just look even inside misfortune, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance. 6. “The greatest misfortune is to not know contentment.” 7. “To hear only what needs to be heard” it is striking for me because my inner child tends to listen to even unconstructive criticism.",

        "text": "I started a small publishing house last year, and one of my objectives was to create an ARC Team that would read Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs) of our books and leave reviews when they are published. The ARC team sign-up sheet includes options for readers to choose which genres of books they like to read, so that they only get books that they would be interested in (which is good for both the reader and the author, since they won't be getting reviews from people who didn't like the book just because they don't like the genre). \n\nI got several sign-ups, but in the first ARC cycle, hardly anyone responded to the announcement that we had a book available for review, and all but one of the ones who did respond just didn't leave a review. It could have been that the book wasn't of interest to everyone, which is fine, but it seems like a free book might be worth a try either way, right?\n\nI am a writer above all, and I have heard writers' opinions on ARC programs (long story short: they're essential for successful book launches), but I was wondering if I could get some reader opinions on what would interest a reader when it comes to ARCs so I can try to build out the team and make it stronger and more reliable. Do you enjoy reading ARCs from indie authors and/or small publishers? Or would you only be interested in reading ARCs from established authors or the bigger publishing houses? Is there anything else that would make you more likely to leave a review of an ARC?\n\nThanks in advance for your opinions!",

        "text": "I have recently read both.  I respect and appreciate both of them as they help pioneer and establish the cyberpunk world aesthetics and atmosphere of science fiction.  I can see how they were huge precursors to other works such as Blade Runner (of course, adapted from DADOES), The Matrix, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, to say a few.\n\nThat being said, neither books will likely make my top favorite book list this year.  I found DADOES to be underwhelming; you'd really need an open mind and wide imagination to immerse into that cyberpunk world; I commend those who were able to do so back around when the book was first published.  Maybe I was spoiled from having watched Blade Runner and 2045 beforehand, so I kept picturing Harrison Ford when following Rick Deckard's exploits.  I share similar sentiments with Neuromancer; however I doubt I'm the only one who found it very confusing and hard to follow.  Other readers have recommended to accept it as what it is and just enjoy the ride.  Some described it as  a \"stream of consciousness\" storytelling.  The plots, concepts, and theme were compelling, maybe even unique for its time.  However, I would have appreciated it more if it was told more clearly in a way that was easier to connect.  If Wikipedia and academic summary websites did not exist, I don't know what I'd do.  At least it's nice to know that I had a general idea of what's going on and these websites confirmed it.  \n\nI do have several questions.  Are most of the books by both of these authors like this?  If I should give them another chance, what other Dick or Gibson novels would you recommend? I don't intend to continue either series.",

She keeps setting up obstacles, then instantly solving them without the characters really doing much. And regularly characters act against their established traits. \n\ne.g. She goes to great lengths to establish that Fitz isn’t very adapt at fighting, and must use other means. Then, decides to have him train with an axe for like a month, and suddenly he’s this overpowered berserker. And the one I’ll never get over is Fitz not being able to identify the Lord’s wife and her dog in the kitchen. Fitz has been trained to be ultra-observant and has a telepathic links with animals. \n\nIt’s disappointing. There’s so much good about this series.

No piece of media has left me feeling like this and I can’t wrap my head around how Tolstoy managed to write this masterpiece. I was going to read a few smaller books before started one as long as Anna Karenina but now I’m just itching to jump into War and Peace. I think Anna Karenina is my favorite story out of any book I’ve read or movie I’ve watched. Wow…",

Wanna do that with me? \n\nFirst of all, ever since Teo barged in on the dinner I suspected Xio had to do something with the ‘possessions of violence’ eyes turning black like obsidian… but I thought ‘No way, it’s too farfetched. He’s prob just looking out bc Teo is giving jaded a bad reputation. \n\n100 pages later… okay never mind I was right. But weren’t ALL obsidians banner? How can Xio be an obsidian. If there was a human bloodline that came from human heritage that survived the banishment (bc at that moment they weren’t half gods) why on earth would sol chose Xio as a competitor?? \n\nIsn’t he all seeing? Wouldn’t he know Xio was an obsidian? And where the hell is mala suerte? Is he obsidian as well?? Did he know about Xio? \n\n\nI also read a tumblr post where the person stated that in the end it wasn’t Xio at all. But a shapeshifter \n\nBut if that were true explain the possessions of violence? That was the obsidians doings \n\nBut even so…. ‘Xio’ in chapter 25 is the son of vengeance. Not of bad luck. Who is he really? How could an obsidian roam earth? \n\nAnd can we blame Tea? If he had just staked Auristela none of this would’ve happened? \n\nBUT if Xio is an obsidian from a bloodline, why didn’t they mess up the sacrifice sooner? They could’ve pushed the sunbearer right before the stone went out… \n\nI NEED ANSWERS.",

[The Book Leo's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC88ehQ14c4) on YouTube proposes a criteria for Dark Academia texts, the most important being #5: Self-critique of the Dark Academia genre. I find her criteria the most comprehensive and so personally define Dark Academia by this, but I'm struggling to find out what the critique in If We Were Villains is.\n\nIn *The Secret History*, it's about the dangers of aesthetic and its escapism. Richard forces his way into the Greek club even though it's clear the professor is elitist, and he's so determined to keep up this pretence that he's as privileged as everyone else that he almost freezes in the winter. When they kill Bunny, it's because he found out about the murder and was threatening to expose them; the murder happened because of Henry's impossible chase after the aesthetic, and Bunny's knowledge was threatening their aesthetic of being intelligent, respectable classics students. In my interpretation, anyways.\n\nSo what's the message in *If We Were Villains*? What is M.L. Rio critiquing? At first I thought it might be the same as *The Secret History* \\- Richard only begins to change once the casting has shifted, once he has lost the power of being the guaranteed lead role; perhaps he's so desperate for the escapism of the aesthetic that he begins to act out. But none of the other characters really suffer from this. Moreover, Oliver's taking the fall for James has nothing to do with aesthetic, it's to do with love. But how is love a critique of the Dark Academia genre?\n\nI'd be really interested in seeing what other people think of this. I know I'm thinking about it too much but I'm fascinated by Dark Academia so I'd love to know how this book connects to it.",

        "author": "NaKeepFighting",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11hissh/as_someone_who_never_reads_nonfiction_books/",
        "text": "\nAs someone who prides themselves with a good grasp of world history and especially American history, I had only ever viewed the occupation of japan from americas perspective, a shinning example of nation building with only a few blemishes such as the policy of “reverse course” which in my opinion held modern japan back in accepting their participation of numerous atrocities and warcrimes, they could have been similar to how modern day Germany accepts their past crimes. As well as the fact we never did hold Hirohito accountable. \n\nHowever, after reading \"Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II\" by John Dower, my perspective on the occupation of Japan has completely shifted. Dower's book presents a comprehensive and thought-provoking account of the post-war period in Japan that goes beyond the typical American narrative.\n\nThrough his meticulous research and vivid storytelling, Dower exposes the complex and often contradictory nature of the occupation. He highlights the struggles and challenges faced by the Japanese people during this period, as well as the tensions and disagreements between the various parties involved in the occupation, including the Americans, Japanese officials, and the Japanese public.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the book is how it highlights the resilience and creativity of the Japanese people during this time of upheaval and reconstruction. Its an event on such a scale that it has never happened before or since, the reforming of a society on such a scale. \n\nOne could argue that the allied occupation of Germany (which started before the Japanese occupation, thus making it a natural blueprint for the future Japanese occupation) was very similar and had basically the same outcome, a facisit warmongering state and its peoples transformed into a peaceful democratic society. Id say the similarities might be in the outcome but the way they came to be are widely different and that the similarities are in fact skin deep, modern day Japan and Germany are actually widely different, \n\n\n\nThe Allies approached the occupations of Japan and Germany differently in terms of their goals and strategies. In Germany, the primary goal was to dismantle the Nazi regime and its associated institutions, and to create a new democratic government. The Allies also sought to punish and hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities committed during the war.\n\nIn Japan, however, the primary goal was to rebuild the country and to create a stable and democratic society. The Allies were less focused on punishing Japanese leaders for their role in the war and instead sought to transform Japan into a peaceful and productive nation. This was reflected in the policies implemented during the occupation, which focused on economic reconstruction, political reform, and cultural change\n\nThirdly, the nature of the societies in Japan and Germany were different. Japan had a highly centralized government and a relatively homogeneous population, while Germany was more diverse and had a federal system of government. These factors influenced the way in which the occupations were conducted and the strategies that were employed.\n\nFinally, the geopolitical context was different. In Germany, the Allies faced the challenge of managing a divided country and addressing the growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. In Japan, the United States was the primary occupying power and had greater control over the country's reconstruction.\n\nOverall, while there were similarities in the occupations of Japan and Germany, such as the imposition of new constitutions and the promotion of democratic values, the differences in the scale of destruction, the goals and strategies of the occupying powers, the nature of the societies, and the geopolitical context meant that the occupations were distinct and had different outcomes.\n\n\nGermany, after World War II, underwent a massive restructuring process known as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" or economic miracle, which was driven by the influx of migrant workers. The systemic removal of racial superiority had been throughly scrubbed from the german psyche allowing for greater understanding and acceptance for the”other”, allowing for the “other” to become German, no longer was it tide to “pure heritage” The German government actively recruited workers from countries like Turkey, Italy, and Greece to help rebuild the country's infrastructure and industries. These guest workers were initially intended to be temporary, but many ended up settling in Germany permanently and forming communities. Over time, these communities have become more integrated into German society, and today, Germany has a large immigrant population and a more welcoming attitude toward immigration. Additionally, the German government has made significant efforts to promote integration and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's post-war occupation was overseen by the United States, which focused on demilitarizing the country and establishing a democratic government. Japan also experienced a “post-war economic miracle” when it experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, but this growth was fueled primarily by domestic investment and export-oriented manufacturing, rather than immigration. Japan however was never forced to accept the “other” like Germany did. Japan's immigration policies have historically been restrictive, with strict visa requirements and limited opportunities for permanent residency. While Japan has recently made some efforts to promote skilled migration and attract foreign workers to address labor shortages, there is still resistance to large-scale immigration and cultural assimilation, these like much of modern Japanese society are remnants of the occupation. \n\nDespite the immense destruction and loss of life, Dower demonstrates how the Japanese people managed to rebuild their lives and their country, often in ways that were very different from what the American occupiers had envisioned. It showcases human resilience and makes me proud to be human, it gives me hope that we can survive anything, we can bounce back from the brink, even when the galaxy begins to fade into darkness, we will be the keepers of the last light. \n\nOverall, \"Embracing Defeat\" is a deeply engaging and enlightening book that provides a nuanced and multi-faceted view of the post-war period in Japan. As someone who typically avoids non-fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and accessible Dower's writing is. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in history, politics, or international relations.",

He happened to be religious too and have a conservative family so I understood what he meant. But got me thinking  that there are books that might be too sexual or violent or simple-minded or religious (if you're an atheist) or whatever that I won't feel proud of having read or enjoyed.\n\nIn my case, I enjoy YA novels but feel it is kind of embarrassing to let some people know, like some college friends of mine. It's almost as if what I \"should\" like is Joyce or Faulkner, as if you can't be educated and enjoy escape fiction or romance or whatever. That if you do, it means you haven't learned to think critically.\n\nI don't know if I'm explaining myself well. Maybe it's my subculture or how I was raised. But anyhow, can anybody relate? Are there books you won't tell others you read or enjoy, for whatever reason?",
