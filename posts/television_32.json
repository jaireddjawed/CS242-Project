Then it became a different take on the same antagonist lasting several seasons (the governor, Negan, etc).  Vince Gilligan could've solved these issues in two episodes.\nEveryone wanted the plot to progress instead of one-off character building episodes.    \nBut what do we have in the Last of Us?  Episode 2, they got slightly further. Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns (Walking Dead haters would have downvoted the episode into oblivion).  Episode 4, we got a little further.     \nI'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.    \nHow many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?     \nHonestly, I only ask because I don't have Chris Hardwick to tell me how great the show I just watched actually was.",

The music direction. the visual direction, the acting. This is hands down one of the best shows I have ever seen and I will continue recommending it to everyone. And after all that... there's the gun. That goddamned gun. The story is so beautiful and fantastic, but I can't get over the gun. The level of manipulation and coercion to bring about a certain outcome that was played out over and over throughout time. Generations of entire families, hell, an entire city was intentionally created just to serve the ultimate end. But, when it finally comes to the main motivation for all of the time traveling, multi-generational fuckery, they choose to just fucking shoot Martha/Jonas. I mean, really? All that time that you had to plan this? You knew everything that would happen. You knew where they were at any given time in history. You made people die in all sorts of poetic scenarios, but when it came down to the wire, you pulled a gun. Maybe it was supposed to be a subversion of Chekhov's gun. I mean, the writing is so tight that just about every scene in this show pushed the story forward (or backward) in some way or another. So, maybe pulling a gun in the third act without much prior setup is an attempt to creatively undermine it. That said, the introduction of the gun in killing Martha/Jonas just felt so cheap in contrast to the complexity of everything surrounding it. Still a big fan of the show, also I'm a bit high and drunk, so thank you if you actually managed to read this.",

I am Netflix’s primary audience. \n\nNo but jokes aside, I’d much prefer a one season show that tells a complete story than a 17 season mess that is only still on television to make a the studio money. \n\nI don’t have the time or patience for something with 100+ episodes and I’m sorry to the friends and family who have given me recommendations I have no intention of ever watching due to my anxieties over high commitment shows.\n\nFor additional context, my favorite show is Over the Garden Wall (though not just because it’s short and complete).\n\nI think miniseries should become more of the norm, because the story is completely planned, often the writing is better or at the very least more consistent, and they rarely overstay their welcome. Also there are no season to season issues like scheduling conflicts that cause a show to randomly write a character out forcing rewrites and unresolved threads. \n\nIn a lot of ways, I think streaming has helped this issue, albeit creating other problems along the way. Anyway that’s my perhaps unpopular opinion.",

I know some stuff doesn't work in tv format and you gotta cut stuff out to make things flow better but some changes in some shows just feel like the writers giving a middle finger to the source materials fans.\n\nI just don't get it. You buy the rights to make a tv show based on an existing series that you presumably bought BECAUSE it already had a fanbase and name recognition. Those fans loved the series because of the stuff that already exist, not because stuff was removed or drastically changed.\n\nLike, I get that name recognition is often easy quick money but wouldn't it be MORE profitable to make a series that doesn't alienate the source materials fans for the sake of whatever changes? They already have so much money &amp; talent behind those shows but they seem to make writing level changes for ... some reason.\n\nJust, why? Is it arrogance from the writers or what?",

        "text": "Hey.\n\nHope you’re doing well.\n\nIt is something I’ve often noticed (particularly pre-streaming, when shows had 20+ episode seasons) that season 3 almost always is the absolute best and most beloved by fans and give most favorable reviews by critics.\n\nThere are some shows where I think it’s the definitive best season and others where it can fairly be considered the best. This list isn’t exhaustive but an example of shows which inarguably (or just arguably) peak in the third season.\n\nIn my opinion (not unique to me, though, it’s a pretty common belief), shows lay the groundwork in the first season which often is a slow introduction, like your first steps in life. In the second season, we see these characters grow further and they start taking their next steps in life into adolescence. We see some physical changes and these young guns start getting a feel for what the world outside their small home bubble could be like. After this is season 3, where adolescence turns into fully-grown adults learning full life lessons, having babies, paying bills, helping raise their new family and fully establishing who they are and who they’re going to be. Everything after this is just an extension of what’s firmly established after this crucial point in life.\n\nDefinitive best:\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nAngel\n\nParks and Rec\n\nThe X-Files\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nFriends\n\nCheers\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nArrested Development\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nWill &amp; Grace\n\nScrubs\n\nMalcolm in the Middle\n\nFuturama\n\nHouse\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nThere are even probably many other shows where the third season is probably at least a contender for the peak of the series.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this accurate? Are there any other shows you think that should be mentioned?",

Recently, every other comment seems to be about finding any and all plotholes. I also notice in movies and television shows, there's a larger discrepancy between critic and audience scores. If you look at content from the early/mid 2010s and before, it's usually pretty similar. \n\nI'm wondering if other people have noticed this? Is this due to the saturation of all media? We see so much all the time that we're jaded? Is it just online communities? Were they more casual 5-10 years ago and now tend to be people who see themselves as critics?",
