Hasn't yet.)\n\nIt is often my policy to, during a first date conversation, throw someone a curveball. This is mostly to save myself time possibly wasted on a second or third date for those who can't catch it.  These curveballs are relatively large parts of my life or things I think about at least twice a week that I notice are not always present in many other people's lives (no value judgement from me either way, just need some common ground).  These curveballs can include, but are not limited to:\n\n\\-Obscure hobbies or topics, like Dungeons and Dragons, SCP articles, Nature Conservation, Historical topics circa 5000 BCE-1800 CE, Musical movements from 1400 to 1950, local mythology\/legends\/folklore from the last two centuries, etc.  I am very nerdy and that covers a lot of ground, factual and fictional.\n\n\\-How open they are to alternative religious views outside of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc. OR how well do they know their faith if they are part of a major religion?  I consider myself an amateur theologian and Spirituality (particularly alternative spirituality) is a huge part of my life that can't be avoided by anyone who wants to be in my life.\n\n\\-The intersections of Psychology, Sociology, and Cultural Studies, individual awareness of social cues, different measurements of intellect, sociological or cultural influences that shape how we perceive each other, etc.  Community Tradition vs individual innovation.  I'm always thinking about how people function individually and as a group.\n\nTo sum up, I'm dropping curveballs like this to try and find someone I can have good conversation with.  If we don't have that much to talk about, this is never going to work.  If all a person can converse about is the everyday stuff most people encounter, I'm going to be bored out my skull with them inside of a month.  \n\nThat being said, I rarely get a positive response for this tactic.  Most people get awkward, or their eyes glaze over and I can see them pull away (\\*not metaphorical, they almost always lean back and stop making eye contact), or some similar nonverbal rejection.   \n\nI've tried the alternative way of broaching the topic by asking them things like \"What's the most interesting thing about you?\" to see if I can get them to open up and find something to serve as a basis for a more stimulating or engrossing interaction, and I've nearly always found myself at a loss as they talk about something that happened when they were 9 that they think is really weird but is actually a somewhat common occurrence, or how they always wanted to visit Japan\/Germany\/Brazil because it seems really cool, or how they read \"The Secret\" once and it seemed really interesting, or how they're still very involved in their fraternity or other childhood social group....That's all well and great for them if that's the life they love, but that's about the point where my eyes glaze over and I just smile and nod as they launch into a 20 minute one-sided conversation I am desperately trying to care about.

Only recently did I feel comfortable to start talking to and seeing new people. About a month ago me and let's call her Maggie (22f) hit it off during a fluke moment at the bar after which we shared some intimate time (not sex). Since that night I have been talking to her fairly casually and we've gotten coffee a few times. I took her on a date this past Thursday which went extremely well. We had some intimate time (not sex) after talking for several hours and getting to know each other better. During the several hours-long conversation I told her candidly I did not know what I was looking for or if I was looking for a relationship at all. She acknowledged this and reciprocated having recently gotten out of a relationship herself.\n\nFast-forward to Saturday night, both of us were out separately with friends. We knew each party was going out that night. After some drinking, I hit it off with a coworker which I did not expect to and we started dancing and making out. Unfortunately, she just so happened to go to the bar we were at and she saw this and sent me a snapchat of her and her friends making a concerned face with the bar location tagged. I saw this after leaving with the girl (which I did not go home with nor intend to).\n\nJust minutes after I saw that I asked her if I could call her later that night to explain myself (as in, I didn't know you thought we were exclusive\/wanted exclusivity but I am willing to do that for you) , to which she replied \"all good\". Again, I pressed her and said I didn't know she felt that way etc. etc. and she doubled down with \"all good!\".\n\nI am super stressed because I really like this girl but we were just starting to get more serious and had only been on one official date. I also had been drinking a lot and I had no previous romantic history with the girl she saw me with. Truth be told, Maggie was the 4th girl I had ever kissed, and the 5th was the one she witnessed. I have been so reserved my whole life and only recently have I gotten a little more explorative. I am not the type of guy she may think I am and I'm worried she thinks I was just using her\/she is another girl to me (absolutely not the case).\n\nAfter she doubled down I didn't respond (she hasn't texted me either) and I plan on letting things cool off for at least a few days, although it's taking every ounce of strength not to text her right now. I know I fucked up, to a degree this is my fault no matter how you spin it (should have communicated better, should have understood implied boundaries etc.) but I'd do anything for another chance with her. So I guess:\n\n1. How do I get her to agree to at least hear me out?\n2.

It scared her off and the whole thing ended up with me being blocked on everything the details are kinda foggy to me given it was so long ago, but we both did some crappy things. Anyways as time passed I could not get over this girl and I would do stupid things like drunk text her or dm her on instagram so on and so forth but I was always met with the cold shoulder despite now being unblocked.  About I would say 6 month ago she matched with me on tinder and i messaged her on there saying something like dumb like \u201cso we running this back\u201d or something like that i don\u2019t remember but i didn\u2019t get a reply until like 2 months later at 2 in the morning she replied to me on tinder saying \u201cmaybe\u201d. So I responded but she never replied again. So I end up messaging her on instagram asking her whats going on and she tells me its a catfish (it clearly wasnt her instagram was linked to the account). However for some reason that just kinda did it for me and I just no longer felt the urge to try and contact her anymore. So now about 2 months ago she randomly messages me on instagram something to the affect of \u201chey i just wanted to say im really sorry for how I treated you and im really happy we were able to meet\u201d which was a total curveball to me because I basically thought i had made her very strongly dislike me given my admittedly overwhelming behavior towards her, yet she was apologizing to me for everything it was odd.  So I tell her well I don\u2019t know how you feel about but it would be nice to see you sometime and we end up making plans to hangout. At this point this girl is back on my mind 24\/7 we are talking all the time and it seems kinda how it was before, but then the day we are supposed to hangout comes and she goes ghost. So im like wtf is going on and I ask her what is up. She replies with an absolutely massive paragraph about how she misses me and she thought she was ready, but she just isn\u2019t and she feels like an insane person who needs to keep working on herself. So i tell her okay and I admit to her that i miss her too, but i can just leave it.  However now I am hyper focused on this situation and i kept having recurring dreams about her so a couple weeks later i text her and tell her how i feel and that i know i said id leave it but I just cant get her off my mind.  She replies to me wnd says shes glad i reached out to her and that she wants to see me but wants to do so around other people so we end up going to bar with some of our mutual friends. We talk and have normal conversation catching up on life, but then I asked her to dance and she very bluntly told me no which I thought was kinda odd because we were vibing pretty well.  After that she kinda starts ignoring me so i just straight up ask her why wont you talk to me all of a sudden. She says \u201cyou know what im gonna give you like 2 minutes of honesty here and pulls me over to a corner to talk.  She starts by telling me that shes a piece of shit that doesn\u2019t deserve someone like me. So I ask her \u201cwhy do you think you\u2019re crazy\u201d and she ends up basically just gushing out all of this stuff about how she thinks she\u2019s worthless and what has she done to deserve someone like me and she only was so mean to me because she wants me to be with someone better than her even though she really likes me. Then she tells me she has a whole journal about me and how she hasn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about me the whole time I haven\u2019t seen her which is like more than a year. She even tells me her mom found everything shes been writing about me and that her mom really likes me and wants her to be with me.  At this point im completely awe struck by all of this and i just tell her she does deserve good things and she tells me im just saying that because im drunk (which i wasnt).  At this point we\u2019re both sitting there with our foreheads touching staring into each other\u2019s eyes and she just says \u201cplease dont try to kiss me\u201d which although i really wanted to i respected it and didn\u2019t.  After that night we were texting all the time and we had planned to hangout, but the day of i ask \u201cso am i still going to see you later\u201d and she very bluntly says \u201cno\u201d without an explanation or anything so i ask her do you not want to see me because i don\u2019t understand Whats going on.  She doesn\u2019t reply for like 2 days and sends me a big old paragraph about how I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and her schedule is just too hectic etc.. so i reply \u201ci understand i just think about you a lot and want to see you\u201d and that was about a week ago haven\u2019t heard from her since.

The point of my question is that why are these girls asking me these questions since they don\u2019t care or want to be affiliated with a loser.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674415.0},{"title":"I (29m) want to write a letter to an exgf (27f) with who I broke up on good terms due to bad timing","author":"Adventurous_Air2381","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11pxi1v\/i_29m_want_to_write_a_letter_to_an_exgf_27f_with\/","text":"We only knew each other for about 2 months, but they were the most passionate 2 months Ive ever felt with anyone. Ive had a girlfriend of 6 years, other short term gfs, one night stands to friends with benefits, and none of them ever made me feel like this girl did.\n\nLong story short, we split because she had kids, we lived an hour away, she was in the middle of a big move and also making a career switch, so she had tons to deal with - she also said she's been in relationships for most of her adult life, and wanted to be able to grow on her own and with her kids. Totally reasonable in the end. She kind of took me on an emotional rollercoaster, but now that the grieving stage is over.. I get it.\n\nIn either case, she told me she loved me so much, would miss me forever and would regret losing me. We talked one final night saying how much we meant, and at the end she blocked my number saying it was so she wasnt tempted to cave and text me.\n\nNow that I can think more clearly about things, I just want to tell her one final set of thoughts, basically just telling her I understand, forgive her, and that if the time ever comes when she feels ready to be committed with someone again, she can try to reach out and not be afraid. Im not upset, or angry. I just miss her.\n\nI dont know how to say this though without seeming like a creep since my number is blocked, but its eating me alive that I cant let it out. It feels like the one final thing I need to do for myself to let her go, get closure for myself, and finally start moving on. I want to handwrite a note and leave it on her car at work but I dont know if that would be considered creepy..? Or if I should even say these things at all and just let it go. Im really conflicted because we split for reasons outside of how much we loved each other, and right up to the very last things we said to each other were saying exactly that. I just want her to know its ok and that she can feel comfortable if she ever wanted to talk again.\n\nAt first I just wrote it out for myself with the intent of sending it to her number which she'd never see - but after writing it I realized these are things I really want her to know. Something like this:\n\n\"I dont know if youll find this, but I wanted to say I read through all of our texts one last time before I finally delete them, and wanted to get off my chest the last few things I should have the other night.\n\nI really loved the idea that we seemed so compatible - we had so many things in common from food and music, to hobbies and interests, backgrounds, and life goals of having a loving family with people we cared about. I was high on the thought I found someone I could go to a country music concert with, stop for hot wings on the way home, do corny stuff like play super smash together, and end the night in bed with someone I\u2019ve never been more compatible with in that too.\n\nEven if I only knew you for a few weeks, I thought the world of that future we could\u2019ve had and it haunts me that we never got the chance to see if we could have those perfect nights. Besides that I fell for little things I never even noticed in other people, like your voice, the feel of your hands in my hair and mine in yours, your cute nose; the way your hugs just melted into mine.\n\nIf you do see this, you don\u2019t need to answer it, but you should know that if you do find yourself grown out of whatever phase you\u2019re in and feel like you are ready to have a real committed shot with someone who cares about you, you can always try to reach out. I need to do some more growing myself and work on how to handle things better too. I don\u2019t know when that will be or if I\u2019d even be available then, but try. Maybe that future is still there and we just met at the wrong time.\n\nUntil then this is the goodbye rant I needed to write for myself so I can stop reading these texts and looking at your pictures and making myself miss you. So goodbye xxx, I hope one day we meet again under better timing and circumstance. I really do. \"\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts? Im maybe thinking I just keep it for myself and wait a few weeks to see if she opens up herself, or if not just leave it for closure for myself. Maybe Im just pathetic.\n\nTl;dr: Want to let out a bottled-up letter to finally move on from an ex whom I parted with on friendly terms","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674401.0},{"title":"Finding things to do together","author":"EnterUsername_420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11pxgfq\/finding_things_to_do_together\/","text":"Me (16\/M) with a (18\/F) can find things to do with her.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674268.0},{"title":"I have a crush on this chick that works at my college dorm.

We\u2019re able to talk about anything, and be honest with each other.  \n\nI asked her a couple months back what she wants out of something like this long-term with me. She had given me, at the time, a kind of non-answer.   Stating that she wants to not feel reliant on anyone anytime soon.

(25 is kinda old by college standards) Sorry for the rambling, I'm feeling a bit emotional.\n\nSo today, my gf of 5 months dumped me.\nI kinda figured this was coming as she recently started to become more distant. Admittedly, she brought up issues in our relationship that I continuously ignored or downplayed. Ex gf is an emotional person, which she uses to convey her thoughts, basically wears her heart on her sleeve. I however, grew up suppressing them due to my environment save for aggression and anger (gotts love broken and abusive homes). So I never really learned how to have a healthy back and forth discussion when upset without being loud and a jerk. \n\nIt really started to bother me that she wouldn't really put much effort into talking with me when we hung out or talked otp. Even when mad she simply seemed annoyed with me rather than upset with the topic of discusson. So Wednesday night In a frustrated tone I asked \"do you even still want this, do you want me\" to which Ex Gf started sobbing exclaiming she didn't know.\n\nOver the last month it slowly started to dawn on me that the root cause of not only our fights and this relationship, but as well as others, was that I was simply scared of letting real vulnerable feelings out for others to see and witness. It was like waking up from a long dream \n\nSo when she asked to hang out today, I figured it was to break up. When she started to get ready to have \"the talk\" I simply gave her a hug and told her that it's okay, and I know what she's getting ready to do. I guess me behaving the complete opposite of what she expected threw her for a loop because she thought I'd scream and yell kicking her out of my apartment. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I would have. So we just laid in my bed, cuddling and talking as she went through crying episodes to talk about her feelings. I mightve been blind to it before but actually listening to her words and feeling her feelings, seeing her perspective I understand why she felt the way she did. I didn't offer her emotional safety. Each time we argued I invalidated her before. This time I really wanted to get to the root cause of how she felt and why she felt that way. I thanked her for being brave and doing something that must've been hard. I offered to help her carry her things to her car, she agreed and said thank you.\nI noticed she left her tooth brush and asked if she'd want it but she just said \"I'll leave it here just incase\"\n\nLater tonight I ran into car trouble which has rendered my vehicle not safe for driving (when it rains it sure pours). So I called Ex gf to give me a ride to an appointment I have an hour away out of town to which she happily agreed to. Which made me question if she's fully disconnected from me or if there's a part of her that still wants the relationship. It wasn't long at all, I've had longer. But it was the most intense and burned the brightest\nI was definitely an asshole and I genuinely regret my actions and feelings it caused her. I guess I'm wondering if this is a salvageable situation or if it's better to let her go. It seemed more painful on her to walk away than it did for me. Like neither of us really wanted the other to leave.\n\nonce again I apologize for the post being all over the place.

The most recent relationship ended very rough and I had really struggled mentally for about 3-4 months following the end of it.

Everything between us is perfect, the sex is amazing (her words), the dates, and every moment I spend with her I'm at peace. A week leading up to our anniversary we would stay up late alot and talk about stuff like her past, she would keep mentioning her ex, who cheated on her after a 10 month relationship. I found it a bit concerning how often she brought him up, and was concerned she wasn't over him since their breakup wasn't too long ago. I remembered when 3 months into our relationship she got a text from her ex in front of me, and she said she would respond to him later. Later she told me he wanted to get back and she just told him to fuck off. Out of curiosity, I opened her phone while she was in the bathroom (fucked up I know), and went through the messages expecting her telling him to fuck off since she always talked badly of him. However I found a long conversation between them from that night, starting with him telling her he fucked up etc to which she responded by saying she hates him for what he put her through. However after some back and forth she calms down and tells him she misses him and what they had was very special. This then escalates into some light flirting which is then ended by a goodbye from him but she goes on by saying she likes his profile picture, thats where the conversation ends. Digging further I found out they were still together after he cheated.\n\nI confronted her about this, I asked her first why she felt the need to flirt with her ex and if she had any feelings for him. Her explanation was that she simply wanted to mess with him, by giving him hope that he could get her back, as revenge for him cheating on her. I asked her why she didnt tell me at the time and she told me she didn't want me to think of her as a petty psycho, and then she just forgot to tell me.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do, I love her more than anything and I know she does too, or atleast I thought so. The thought of being a second option to her, or the nice guy she uses to get over her ex is revolting, and if that's the case I want to cut her off immediately. I honestly don't know what to believe.

I would be appreciative of some unbiased opinions. Apologies if this is too long. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m a guy in my mid 20\u2019s who has been out of the dating game for a little while longer than I expected. It probably took me a solid 2 years to get over my last serious relationship and I haven\u2019t actively pursued a serious relationship since. People would describe me as fairly attractive but my self confidence never fully recovered after my last breakup. \n\nOne of my co-workers recently became single after being cheated on in a 7 year relationship. I\u2019ve had a crush on this girl for the past 2 years and was intending to give her more time and space after her breakup before shooting my shot with her. This idea didn\u2019t go to plan after we hooked up on New Year\u2019s Eve. She initiated the first kiss which came as a pleasant surprise. For the remainder of the night we couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other. One thing led to another and we hooked up that night.\n\nAfter this interaction on New Years we messaged back and forth for weeks, both at work and outside of work. We grabbed lunch each week our rotas matched at work and went on a couple of dates outside of work during this time. Additionally, she joined my friends and I each weekend we went out drinking. \n\nThings were going amazingly and I have never fallen so hard and fast for someone before. However, she did clearly outline that due to the length of time she had spent in an unhappy relationship, she wanted to take things slowly and even date other people. I was not thrilled to hear this news and I made my objections known. Nevertheless, we continued to date and she was telling me all the things I wanted to hear. In particular, she said that she was reconsidering her opinions on marriage and kids after dating someone like me. \n\nThe problems started occurring when 2 people I considered friends from work started getting quite bitter and jealous. Admittedly, they both had feelings for this girl which were not reciprocated by her. We would often hear that they had been talking very negatively behind our back and spreading malicious rumours. In addition to these two people, other work colleagues expressed their opinion on us as a couple (almost entirely positive). However, the whole situation was getting messy and putting pressure on her. Understandably she was upset with the negative opinions and didn\u2019t like how much it was interfering with work. \n\nThe other problems were linked to her wanting to date other people to figure out her dating goals. Although unhappy, I was not going to stand in the way of this action but asked her to let me know if\/ when she was gonna date someone else so that I could end our brief relationship. It became quite clear that although she liked me a lot, we were in 2 different places and I definitely had fallen faster than her. As a result, she ended things with me to avoid further confusion, work entanglements and general pressure. \n\nFast forward 1 month and she now appears to be in a relationship judging by slightly cryptic but obvious social media posts. I would normally respect the confines of a relationship but I truly believe that this girl could be my future wife. I don\u2019t want to live with regret of not knowing what if, but at the same time it was her that ended the relationship with me. I\u2019ve dated other people since to ensure that I\u2019m not just getting overly attached to this girl after such a long time out of the dating game. All I can think about is this girl and how amazing she is. Maybe I\u2019m putting her on a pedestal in my mind but she really is beautiful inside and out. \n\nWould I be a fool to keep pursuing her now that she is in a relationship? Would that be a complete dick move? Or is pursuing her a terrible idea that would lower her opinion of me? My friends are telling me to move on but I don\u2019t want her to be the one that got away. I\u2019d much rather her be the one.

As the title, says, I\u2019ve never dated and I\u2019m worried I missed my chance for two reasons. 1 - not being in a relationship when you\u2019re young means you missed formative time to develop the skills needed to get dates and then maintain relationships. 2 - it was so much easier to meet women when I was in high school and college than now. I don\u2019t know how to meet single women now. Online dating for me is a complete disaster - I can\u2019t get a single match, there aren\u2019t any women at the clubs I participate in and all the women at my work seem to be taken. So I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever going to meet someone? I don\u2019t drink or do drugs and I\u2019m somewhat introverted so I hate going to bars and night clubs. I\u2019ve gone to bars and night clubs stone cold stone sober but it\u2019s just too weird.

But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really the case. Maybe I did miss the boat?\n\nA lot of dating advice for men who haven\u2019t dated is \u201cfocus on improving yourself and dates will come.\u201d I don\u2019t think I believe that. If you can\u2019t even meet women, how are you ever going to get a date? Where do women like to hang out where they\u2019re open to meeting men that\u2019s not a bar? Do I just approach women at the grocery store or the gym or something? \n\nAnd finally, when you do meet someone who likes you, then what? I\u2019ve always struggled with this step because I either 1 - assume they are just being nice, 2 - am oblivious to hints, 3 - worried about rejection, and 4 - not sure how and when to actually ask for a date? \n\nSorry if this was a lot of questions all in one post, but those are just my thoughts on the matter.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678669151.0},{"title":"My (28f) boyfriend (28m) returned from a 2 week trip very distant and weird..

She was incredible in every aspect of the word, and my stereotype for an \"Ideal Girl\". She reads books, goes to the gym, has an incredible body, a beautiful face and hair, and is really ambitious. Literally my perfect girl.\n\nThe fact is, we both liked each other, we both started to talk\/text till the midnight, and we were planning about being more than just friends. We were impressed by each other, and used to lust a lot for the other one. It was all like a fairy tale.\n\nOne day, I just wake up, and don't feel anything for her. We start to talk and it doesn't feels the same, she starts to flirt and it was uncomfortable for me. I really don't know why that happened.\n\nAfter a few days, I spoke to her at her birthday and told her that I did not felt the same, and it was weird. I gave her \"freedom\" (kinda autistic, ik) and told her that we shouldn't keep talking because I lost interest, and I didn't want her to feel too attached to me. I thought it would be cruel, and decided that was the best I could do.\n\nShe asked me if she did something wrong, if she could fix something about her, if I didn't like an attitude, yadayada. I said no, it just wasn't the same. She called me holding back tears, we spoke for about and hour, and then we both said goodbye.\n\nI will be honest, I don't miss her, and that's the most intriguing thing for me.\n\nI know that if I just try to speak with her on instagram, she will be happy to speak with me again. Probably really angry at first, but happy, at least. I know it, but I just don't even feel like it.\n\nShe was literally my perfect girl (I wrote my Ideal Girl Stereotype on my diary a few months ago), and even if she was a 20\/10, a girl that most guys would kill just to have a chance with, I wasn't interested at all, and now I'm not even sure if I really developed any feelings for her or not at the time.\n\n\u00bfCan somebody give me some kind of explanation? \u00bfSome psychological stuff or anything?\n\nI don't know why this happened to me, but I don't want this to happen again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, now, other stuff I think I should say, to add more context:\n\n\\-I'm a narcissist, a psychiatrist diagnosed me with that mental disorder, and I'm fighting with it since. I have a really strong ego, and a stronger character. (That was one of the things she liked).\n\n\\-I'm really outlandish, weird, Idk. Kinda autistic, cringe, as I said earlier. I like to feel and act with extreme confidence, like a character from a movie\/book. (She described me as a character written by a woman more than once).\n\n\\-The only thing I didn't liked about her, was that she didn't gave me all that much of her attention. We are both on self-improvement (Gym, reading, meditation, all of that) and we were really busy. But it was busy to a level that sometimes, she could pass a day without even seeing my texts.\n\n\\-One time, she confessed that sometimes she just ignored me because beign attentive was not in her nature, or she just \"didn't felt\" like answering my messages. (This actually angered me for a while, but even then, when I told her calmly about this she promised to speak more with me. She was awesome communicating, and I felt really understood).\n\n\\-I really thought that she just started to feel overwhelmed from me, or my way of beign, but she tried to mantain contact with me till the last minute.\n\n\\-It always has been difficult to me to fall in love with other girls (or even being attracted to them in a more deep, intimate way). I always had at least two girls that wanted me, but I just never felt like having a relationship, this was the only girl I could think as an exception.\n\n\\-I really think I was the problem, something with me beign wrong or anything. Be as harsh as you want, I will accept it. I need to know what to do in order to know my problem and how to fix it.\n\nI don't want this to happen in the future, I want to be able to heal this.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678653738.0},{"title":"i (20f) think i may like a friend (21m) but don\u2019t know if i\u2019m misinterpreting the signs","author":"happitappimappi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11putoi\/i_20f_think_i_may_like_a_friend_21m_but_dont_know\/","text":"about a month ago, i had met someone through a program i am doing this upcoming spring.

But would message me randomly to see how I was. Then recently, one of my friend's band was playing at the bar she talked about. I told her I would be out there to see them. And she said stop by and say hello. And she gave me her address. She could go out that evening because she had her son that weekend. So it was a quick hello. Lasted no more than 5 mins. I brought her a chocolate bar. She said she loved this particular type and it stuck with me. She was shocked I remembered. She wasn't wearing anything special, just comfy clothes- yoga pants and hoodie. But she had perfume on. And in that short meeting, she hugged me three times and looked excited to see me. \n\nAnd of course, after that little meeting she went and said let's make plans again. I told her there was a record store by her place that I wanted to go to and she said let's plan lunch on a weekend she was kid-free.  We made plans for this weekend. And I messaged her Tuesday if she was still good to go. And then she said it had slipped her mind and she had planned on working. So I'm leaving it her court at this time.

We met through a mutual friend who informed me he was gay. I know he dated women in the past, but I was under the presumption that he discovered he only liked men (turns out this may have been a false presumption). This man is ridiculously attractive and he has many qualities that I would like to see in a partner, although I never thought of him romantically because I thought he was exclusively attracted to men.\n\nA few nights ago I went over to his apartment for a movie night and he was being more \"touchy\" than usual (hugging a lot, leaning up against me, etc.,). This still felt like normal behavior and I was completely comfortable with it. After the movie, we went to a party. I didn't drink at all, but he downed a few. After that, he was becoming even more touchy with me (hugging for LONG periods of time, holding my hand, hugging me from behind, etc). I was still comfortable with this and thought it was him being himself but drunk.\n\nAt one point we were sitting together in a loud, dim room and he looked at me and said he had a crush on me. I thought he was jokingly flirting, as we tend to do so quite a bit, so I said \"I have a crush on you too!\" He stared at more for a while and said \"No, like I really have a crush on you.\" I continued to be playful back, as I assumed we were joking around. He pulled out his phone and opened a conversation with one of his life-long best friends. He scrolled through it, stopping at a conversation they had just before the party. He texted her something along the lines of \"I have a crush on a girl. Her name's (My Name). She's very cute.\" The conversation went back and forth between his friend asking questions about me and him answering. At this point, I was extremely flattered but also really fucking confused. One of the later messages he sent read something along the lines of \"I'd never fuck her but...\" Reading this definitely made me a bit uncomfortable. After reading their conversation, I looked back at him not knowing what to do or say. He was staring back at me with such intensity and desperation. No one has ever looked at me like that before and I wanted to die. He was still being quite touchy throughout the rest of the night (which I didn't mind) and he drunkenly made a few flattering statements to me.\n\nAnd now, I simply don't know what to do. We haven't talked much since then (other than the typical boring conversation about our day). Does he remember showing me those messages? I wanted to convince myself he was just drunk and didn't mean it but those were sober messages. We are extremely close friends and I feel as this is definitely going to change our friendship dynamic. Should I bring this up to him and ask him about it? Is he discovering a new part of himself? Like I said, he is incredibly gorgeous and I have told him I would 1000% date him if he were attracted to woman. But now that it may be a possibility I don't know if I meant that. I also feel as though this is him rediscovering parts of himself and I don't want to be his experiment. I love him so much and I'm scared I will lose him over this.\n\nAs you can tell, I am very confused and I have so many scattered thoughts about this.

I grew up in a typical Hispanic family with traditional values. I\u2019ve always been told by my cousins (not my parents and siblings) that when we date to marry it should be women within our own race. I was curious about my ancestors (I knew I had Aztec, Spaniard, and Portuguese DNA), so I purchased the ancestry DNA test kit, and the results were pretty shocking.  My DNA was composed of Spaniard, Portuguese, Native Indian (Aztec to be precise), Italian, and African (less than 1.5%). \nI have been on dozens of dates with Hispanic women, but it has not worked out (it was either my height, vibe, not growing a beard, fashion style, not being a simp, or any other reason). So I took time to work on myself, I grew out my beard, started focusing on my career and health (I used to weight 250lbd now I\u2019m at 170), avoided any sort of television (read more books), and started doing a skin care routine.\nI have been dating Monica (who happens to be the 1st Black woman I date) for the past 5 months, after we met at Planet Fitness; technically she came up to me (after she caught me looking at her multiple times lol).

However, on Ok Cupid I noticed that I had a lot of people looking at my profile so I think I might end up paying for ok cupid for a month or so. Another reason I want to do Ok cupid is because I want more than a hookup with people. However, I'm not sure how much I really want a relationship. Is it weird to want to find a safe partner to hook up with occasionally? Another thing I was going to write as part of my self-description is that whoever I end up seeing I want them to go and get tested for HIV or STD's. And I want them to save the paperwork and show me they were tested. I don't feel like it's asking too much because I plan on getting tested and keeping the paperwork for myself or anyone who wants to see also, it's not like I am holding people to unfair expectations that I wouldn't do for them or for myself also. Do you think that is asking too much or that I have unrealistic expectations?  \n\n\nThe main two reason I want to do it like this is because   \n1) i want to have safe sex with someone  \n2) I get emotionally attached even too people I just sleep with and   \n3) I want to feel a connection with my sex partner.  \n\n\nDoes this sound weird to you guys, or is this something that other people do too?   \nAlso, are there any dating sites you would recommend me paying for, I think I am going to go with Ok Cupid since it is for more than hookups. I feel like the whole \"you have to get tested first and show me the paperwork\" is a little much, but at the same time I think other people might actually respect me more for wanting to be safe, and that maybe even girls might want to be with me more since I am bi-sexual and I think girls are a little nervous that someone who is gay also might have std's or something.

We tend to go out to dinners, raves, nerd out on literature, art, philosophy, overall just really enjoy and respect her company. Being that we\u2019re such close friends there\u2019s a lot of hesitancy on my part to initiate anything as I care about her deeply and don\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable. About a month ago, I told her I thought I was developing feelings and expressed everything I appreciate about her etc etc in which she\u2019d blush and reciprocate the same gratitude for certain qualities of mine. She wasn\u2019t able to express how she felt, going on this tangent of stuttering and saying how she doesn\u2019t believe emotions can truly be fully verbalized etc. Nonetheless, the convo was not awkward at all and I thought it was actually one of the most genuine and beautiful convos I\u2019ve had. I was dead confused, and a few days later we even both ignored eachother when we saw eachother while walking to class, but a week later she reaches out. We also end up seeing each other a few times at our colleges dinning hall that week and she\u2019d join my friend and sit next to me everytime. (My friends would always say they\u2019d immediately feel like they were third wheeling). We end up going to dinner again and then a rave, all paid by me. There at one point we sit down next to each other and I have my arm around her while the other was rubbing her leg or holding her hand where she\u2019d rub my hand back. She was clearly very fine with this. On the ride back home she fell asleep on my shoulder and when we said good bye at her dorm I kissed her on the cheek and then we just kept holding hands and saying but not letting go. \n\nNow, I proposed to take a weekend trip to Europe (we\u2019re in the US), just us two where I offered to pay if she couldn\u2019t afford. She was done but she insisted to split bc I\u2019ve been paying for everything so far. I let her pick the Airbnb and we chose a studio 1 bedroom. We book and we both seem excited. A week later she invites me over to cook me a meal, and there again she lays on my chest for a bit and we hold hands and chat while she tells me about her art projects. I give her a hug goodbye and dip late at night. We tend to see eachother once or twice a week as we\u2019re both very independent and busy. I see her a few days later and everything is chill. The next day I have to fly back home for break and we go shopping for a gift. I end up buying something she liked and give it to her while I\u2019m waiting for my Uber to pick for airport as I was in a mad rush. She seems shocked I got her something and is about to scurry away when I lean in for a hug and she gives me the stiffest side hug. Confused asf now man. Text her before I take off hoping she has a good break sends me long texts back detailing how her day went and includes something about the gift I got her. I respond and now no response from her. \n\nOur personalities: we\u2019re both quite shy, I\u2019d say more so her, but me too. Very in our heads type people (we study math and philosophy). We also both have interesting quirks, we email eachother more often than text (sometimes just images, sometimes poems, sometimes essays lol), we don\u2019t text unless it\u2019s to make plans.

She didn't friendzoned me nor made me her boyfriend. \n\nBut one thing sure she was always sure to keep me at distance like whenever I try to take things further than being friends she maintainted balance. I've never confronted my feelings but she pull herself back when I show real attention. But When I pull myself back, showing less attention, she just pull me back to her, showing me enough attention so I won't leave her being the best buddy or whatever that is for her.\n\nI always had my suspicions she was hiding something but didn't want to think bad about her, she seemed to tell me everything so I trusted. She said she had no instagram, she didn't take any interest on that app. But today was a day that changed anything.\n\n She started to show me more and more attention and finally she told me she had some strange feelings about me for a while that she wants to explore. She wanted me close but not so close, she said she has a different life style that she showed me so far.

She presented herself like an another person completely. Damn I've never even saw her wearing black but somehow she's an satanist who likes getting high and bdsm ? Her instagram is full of wearing sexy clothes in blacj and getting high. I don't judge anyone who prefers this life, I'm a heavy drinker too but why kept as a secret and pretents to be like someone else for 5 years ? I don't know, she says she wants me in her life for but I'm not sure if i can trust her back even though I love her.\n\nEdit: Well I was so hasty writing this i forgot about myself. I'm someone who has a average body, nice face, and someone with nice atttidutes especially around girls. I'm not usually shy but shy around girls, i can't easily flirt or have one night sex.

We absolutely do not take it slowly during a very intense third date. Girl is recoiling and I don't know what to do, so please share your wisdom with this poor guy that had an amazing set of dates.\n\nSo, lets start the tale:\n\nMatched with this girl at the end of January and we were having a great time chatting. We settled on a date but a few days after, I tested positive for covid, so we postponed; she also went to her home country so, we chatted all of February and then met 2 weeks ago.\n\nFirst date was super nice, we went for coffee and then to my place to watch a movie. Nothing happened, since she told me she'd like to take things slow so I didn't went for the kiss or anything, just you know, a bit of cuddling while watching the movie. We decided to meet again next weekend but while chatting during the week, she tells me she's near my place and so, I invited her to have dinner together and she agreed. Amazing date, best dates are the impromptu dates.\n\nThen comes the 3rd date. We met really early since we went to buy some furniture together (she changed places recently) we hold hands; then we went for tacos cause it was near the subway station, then we went back to my place, cuddled a bit and napped and then we kissed. 10\/10 impromptu kisses are the best kind of kisses. Here we start having like this really deep, personal conversation, and she tells me she recently lost one of her parents and decided to move to this city, 2 years ago, to pursue her passion. We continue to talk and talk and it seems we don't want it to end there, so invite her to a pub near my house. We go, we talk a bit more, get 1 beer and stuff and then decided to go back to my place...\n\nYeah... stuff happened. She tells me a lot of her story, she cries, she laughs, I'm just there listening and just enjoying the moment. I invite her to stay and she stays. Next day stuff happens again several times, we go for a walk, I take her to my favorite bookstore, we go back to my place, read together and well, I guess you get the idea. She leaves at 9pm.\n\nThen comes Monday and Tuesday... pretty quiet but I understand, I wanted to gtfo too, I told her things only my BFFs know, it felt too good but it was too fast and at 35yo, I know what happens when you go so hard, so fast... thing is, I didn't want it to happen this time :(. While thinking myself wtf happened and why did it feel so natural, I remembered she told me she sometimes feels she's ready for a relationship, she wants it, but last couple of times she recoils and set up walls because maybe, just maybe, she's still dealing with the mourning and all that and I was like dammit, she's spoiling the ending and I didn't listen!\n\nWednesday comes and I tell her I notice she's being quiet and that I was gonna give her space, but to let me know if she wanted to meet on the weekend again.\n\nWhy are you still reading? We know what happens next.\n\nFriday comes, she sends me a message saying:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I've been thinking for days about what I am feeling, and I think I'm emotionally exhausted.  \n>  \n>I don't know why this is happening, but I think I need a space.  \n>  \n>Maybe for me it's too early to date with someone, idk,  \n>  \n>I really had a wonderful time with you, that's true, but I don't know how long it takes me to process this emotion, and I don't want you to worry about me or wait for me, because this is my problem, and you are a really good person, I believe you\u00a0deserve\u00a0more.\n\nI respond saying hi and that I understood, then I said I understood the space thing, but wanted to know if she wanted to keep dating after thinking stuff and she says she doesn't know, but she wanted me to know is not because she doesn't like me or didn't enjoy the weekend together, but she doesn't want me to wait for her or hurt me anymore.\n\nI didn't want to pressure her any longer, just say I think this is worth a fight or a wait, so that the door was open if she decided she wants a relationship.\n\nLook, I've been in this game for far too long, I know that when a girl tells you you're great but she doesn't want to hurt you or make you wait, is just them sugarcoating rejection, which is fine! I usually take the L, appreciate them telling me and just move along... but... this time I don't know what to believe, not even what to do... So that's why I am here, looking for advice from you guys.\n\nWhat would you do in my place? Is this salvageable? Should I just move on? Even after this I have a good feeling about this but...

One Most notably was if I was dating someone or perusing anyone. I replied I\u2019m not and shot the question back at her and she replied the same. we haven\u2019t really talked about stuff like that before but did get me thinking about stuff.\n\nfast forward to this past weekend and we were at a party for someone leaving work. We both got there about the same time and sat beside each other at the table. It was kinda awkward at first as I was the only guy there at the time Haha. It got a little easier then when we started talking and out of nowhere we were talking about when she first joined the job and said that I was one of 3 people she gravitated to and talked to when she started. I was kinda thrown off by this as I\u2019m a notoriously hard person to go up and talk to when begging as I do have a very hard external look (resting bitch face etc. and wearing metal band shirts and a battle vest when not in work uniform and a general attitude towards new people due to the very short turnover in ew staff only lasting maybe 2 months at most so I don\u2019t normally get too attached to anyone just in case they arE let go) about me that I would say isn\u2019t exactly inviting to someone new. Anyway she said that and honestly I told her I couldn\u2019t believe her for those reasons. she smiled and said that it didn\u2019t bother her and said that I was one of the few nice and sweet people towards her when she started. After a while I told her i owed her a drink from this past gone Christmas party. So hot her what she liked and began talking again.\n\nwe were joking about this app be real that she got a notification for. i told her I didn\u2019t know when it was and that I usually only have 3 or 4 social media apps at a time. Mainly Facebook and instagram and maybe snapchat. after I said snap chat and opened it up she asked to add her on it. Soo I did and warned her that I don\u2019t use it much and to just msg me if she wanted on instagram like we have before. Towards the middle of the night she was headed off with her work friends to a different bar that is too far out of the way for me but before she left she had one of the bar tenders to get me a drink and said it was repayment for the one I got her earlier even though I explicitly said she didn\u2019t need to repay me or anything.\n\nfast forward to this evening I\u2019m in work and check my phone and see a notification in snapchat I open it and she that she has sent me a message in the early hours of the morning.

Chill and easy going personality that I really connect with. She likes attention and has no trouble getting it, and hasn\u2019t been truly single for a very long time. We went to college together, but dated other people. She dated a friend of mine for 2 years, and left him for another guy she started talking to during their relationship (flirt at parties, snapchat\/text, but nothing physical). \n\nShe did the same thing to that guy 2-3 years later with me, so now I\u2019m the guy she ended her relationship for and have been talking to her off and on since.\n\nShe moved on extremely quickly and had no second thoughts in both cases. \n\nI dated her seriously for about 3 months, then broke things off because she wanted to move really fast, we didn\u2019t have many hobbies in common, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I would ever be able to fully trust her.\n\nI felt very good about that decision at the time and never had second thoughts until now.\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk or see eachother for about 2 months after that, but then started hooking up casually and have been for the last few months.\n\nAs long as I\u2019ve known her, there\u2019s been a mutual interest and very natural connection. Our personalities and views are very similar, even though our hobbies and interests are not. It\u2019s been some of the easiest conversation and comfortability I\u2019ve found in a woman, and she\u2019s said the same for me. Even going so far as to say I\u2019m either the love of her life or the worst thing that\u2019s happened to her as I\u2019ll be someone she will compare any other men she dates to forever.\n\nShe\u2019s been talking to\/casually dating other people since I broke things off with her, which she has every right to do.

She was my first real girlfriend. Through the duration of the year we were together, there were lots of complications in our relationship. We both had extreme trust issues, mental health issues, and we both struggled a lot with jealousy. We fought a lot but she felt like home to me after a bit. We would fight so bad but we would also love so hard, it was truly two extremes and nowhere in the middle. We shared a lot of good and a lot of bad moments (we both cheated, she hit me a few times, etc). Over all, very messy. \n\nBut through all of this I could never bring myself to hate her. Yes she made me feel rage like no other, but she also made me the happiest I\u2019ve ever been at some points. I broke up with her 4 times and each time found myself longing for her. In January we had a really bad fight and I just couldn\u2019t take it so I, once again, dumped her. Around this time last month I missed her so much and reached out, expecting things to go back to normal. This time she found someone new and didn\u2019t want to take me back. I was gut wrenched. I kept trying to convince her to come back but to no avail. We didn\u2019t talk for a few days until she eventually called me, saying she was willing to work things out. We hung out a few times in the coming days, and she kept changing her mind on things. We cried together, she said she just wanted to get over me. I felt terrible but she wanted to go out to dinner. \n\nWe met up one night and just talked. She sent me her schedule for this month (march) and told me to pick a day for us to go on a date. She seemed to want to come back to me, and all felt right for a bit. Until the next morning, when I texted saying when I wanted to take her out. She replied saying she didn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore and didn\u2019t have it in her to fix it with me at this point. Next thing I knew my number was blocked\n\nHours later, she sends me a Snapchat of her new guy kissing her on the cheek and giving me the middle finger. Mind you I had an argument with this guy over the phone two weeks prior. Not to get into detail about how I reacted, but Tuesday I will be turning myself in to the police and will be seeing a judge.\n\nThe point of this story is, no matter how much you love something or someone, you need to let them go when the time comes. no matter how hard it is. I have found someone new, and when I\u2019m with her I think of my ex. I\u2019m heart broken but I know I really broke my own heart. I try to be the least problematic person I possibly can be, but this person brought out a side of me I never knew existed. \n\nIf it\u2019s not right, walk away from it. Life has been trying to teach me lessons and I have been too stubborn to accept them. I\u2019m no saint but I understand that nobody truly is, so all I ask is if someone out there is dealing with something similar and just can\u2019t let go, please just give yourself a chance.

There's that chemistry between us that I've really been looking for, time flies in all of our dates and we're always scheduling the next one right away. I have a really good feeling about her and think I'm starting to really like her. \n\nWe just went on our fourth date last night and she wanted to keep it as a chill hangout where I go over to her place and we just watch some shows, grabs some snacks and play some games, since that's what we're both into. The day was going really well until about 30 minutes into the last game we were playing she was saying she was feeling nauseous and needed to stop. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but she said she just needed to lie down and take a shower. We're also both introverts so I figured I'd ask her if she needed some time alone to rest as she had a busy night out the previous night with friends and she said she did. She gave me a kiss as I left her place, and told me to text her when I got home. I did checked in on how she was doing and she was feeling a lot better after she had thrown up. We then locked down our next date in a couple of days in the evening after she's finished a hangout with her friend. \n\nBut the rest of the night she was a lot colder with me through text. Even when she messaged me this morning it was colder than normal even though she said she was feeling a lot better and slept well. I feel like I know I'm reading too much into this but I've has situations like this in the past where this was the first step towards someone pushing me away. Maybe there's no glaring signs of anything bad happening here and I'm over thinking it all based of some not great past experiences.\n\nI do like this girl and we've both spoken about some bigger life things with each other and some future possibilities and outlooks. Up until last night there was no doubt in my mind that she was all in based on how she was talking. I guess part of me was thinking we were going to move into the next phase of us being intimate with each other as we haven't moved beyond some light kissing. Part of me is wondering if she was expecting me to make a big move last night and when it looked like I wasn't going to that she wanted to bail on the night? I donno. I was wanting to make a move and was planning to later in the hangout when it felt more natural but we never quite got there, and I guess part of me is a little frustrated that I hadn't acted on it sooner -\\_-\n\nAm I reading too much into this? Part of me wants to tell her how I feel about her but a huuuge part of me feels like that's likely moving way too fast. Before she got sick last night I felt like the feeling was super mutual so now I'm questioning a bit, in big part to myself, I know. My plan is to just keep acting as normal, and see how things go on the next date and go from there. But if anyone else has any suggestions that would be greatly appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;dr\\*\\* I'm really hitting it off with this girl that I'm going on dates with but our latest date ended prematurely with her feeling sick and she's been a little distant ever since, even though she's feeling better.

She tries to talk with me, break awkard silences and asks questions. Talk about kinds of movies she likes in cinema and quisines she enjoys. Smiles when I joke but when I sit beside her she does not look at me when talking and prefers to sit in front of me. Last time we were sitting in the bus I could feel she was feeling weird yet still tried to talk and keep conversation going. She even asked me about my work life and how do I do. I am confused about her behaviour, I like her very much but I do not want to loser her since I enjoy talking with her. I broke touch barrier by giving her handshake and while she was surprised she agreed.\n\nWe do not message eachother since I suck at it and she never reached out to me.\n\nTLDR: Girl is flirty and open with other people but is awkard and ''shy'' when we are alone, still tries to talk, what should I do?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678658199.0},{"title":"Why would a guy want to makeout and do it all but not have sex","author":"Proper-Potato2389","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11pr3vb\/why_would_a_guy_want_to_makeout_and_do_it_all_but\/","text":"Please keep in mind we have hooked up in the past.

About 72 hours ago I think I met at the love of my life (also 18m) and I don't know what to do. I'm very comfortable with my sexuality and so is he so i don't think what i'm going to it a strictly \"gay\" experience. I've known lots of straight people who have fallen for someone they just met and seen many of them mess it up by admitting to what they're feeling too early.\n\nI know that he at least feels physically attracted to me seeing he's had his tongue down my throat uncountable times haha and he didn't seem to be against it at all, but then when I brought up the question of \"when do you wanna meet up again\" he answers with the word \"probably\". Even though he did mean to come off in a joke away I can't help but wonder if he was actually thinking something else in his head but didn't want to hurt me. At this point I would just rather he be honest with me before I get too attached because they do say when you know you know if you really have a connection with someone and I was feeling that connection. Whether he was or wasn't I have no idea.\n\nHe's also really bad at replying and I really don't want to double text him so he doesn't think that I'm too interested in him because I obviously don't want to come across as desperate. I guess I just want to know what I should be doing with all this time I have in my day because now I just find myself waiting to hear my phone buzz to check if it's him. I went out with him last night on a kind of date but I don't know if you could call it that because we didn't really go to a bar or to dinner, he just took me back to his apartment which would suggest more of a casual thing although there was some actual interesting conversation too. I'm probably overthinking it all. He was also very late to the bar where we met and didn't proceed to go into but I think I'm putting his tardiness down to the fact that he's not from the same culture as I am and so doesn't have the same ideas about punctuality I guess. Anything except him not really wanting to see me.\n\nWhere do I go from here? I'm obviously trying not to check my phone that's often as I did yesterday but it's so stressful leaving my phone so where thinking that I could miss a text. Is that a healthy sign that I'm genuinely attracted to him in a \"lovey\" way because I don't think it's an obsession per se because I honestly I only met him 72 hours ago.

He was my childhood crush in middle school, but of course had no idea who I was. I was a shy girl that stayed in my lane and was pretty much mute. We matched on tinder and started talking and seeing each other almost everyday. We haven\u2019t made anything official but he\u2019s thrown around the word LOVE. I do have love for him but I\u2019m very frustrated with him. We haven\u2019t had sex, he\u2019s told me that he\u2019s worried that our relationship will only be about sex since he\u2019s had past relationships like that. Also worried about post \ud83c\udf30 clarity but he now says he\u2019s not worried about that since he has strong feelings for me. I\u2019ve been patient with him about it but recently I\u2019m getting very sexually frustrated. Specially since he likes to get me very turned on and leave me with woman blue balls. Recently I was on my \ud83e\ude78and that first day I got it he said he was going to fuck me but then couldn\u2019t. I said soon as I get off of it he needs to. Well I got off of it and told him so, we joked about having sex and he then left me on delivered for 5 hours. That day we were also suppose to go to the drive ins that he mentioned he would take me a week prior. I did not remind him because I want to be prioritized without needing to remind a man. I knew already that he forgot because it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done this. I took a nap instead and seen that he texted me apologizing for not texting since he was playing games with his homies and time slipped. I don\u2019t care about that, glad he has fun with games since I do the same. Just upsetting, I mentioned that he forgot and he was very sorry about it. I hate being told sorry, I want action. I also thought he would jump at the idea of me being off my period and give me what I\u2019ve been craving. He did not then, and today again nothing. We are very open about everything and anything together, he\u2019s mentioned past flings and hook ups and one night stands. It\u2019s frustrating to hear that he can have sex with strangers no problem but won\u2019t do anything with me.

She asked if that was the best one I had, I told her a better one and she laughed a bit more. We talked a bit more and found out that we were both in not only the same program but also in one of the same classes which was just the biggest coincidence I found myself in. I tagged along with her and her friends for the rest of the night until she went home. We had a great conversation while we were walking too. We kept talking until we left each other on good terms. \n\nOver the next couple weeks we soon got to talking more often with each other through text mostly because we exchanged numbers. We also talked with each other during our shared class, but the class started at 8am and she was often too tired to talk. The only times I ever spoke with her outside of this class were when we first met at the bar and at a library where I set up a study meet up (kinda date?) a few weeks ago. \n\nDuring this meet up we talked about a lot of things from movies\/shows we liked to stuff about our pasts to our current classes and future plans. \n\nNow, a midterm exam for our class happened last week and I wanted to organize another study meetup the weekend before to discuss it. I proposed it to her over text, but she said she had a friend\u2019s birthday party she planned on going to. I told her I understood that and shared her a quizlet study set I created anyway. \n\nNow, over time, I found out that we most often talked about classwork through text. Most attempts by me to talk about something else through text wind up with me getting ghosted. For example, I asked how the birthday party was going and she ghosted me. (Side note: would calling her or using insta messaging be better than just texting?)\n\nThis dynamic makes me concerned that she might only see me as a class resource or unofficial academic partner for her and any other attempts to talk more about different non-school subjects through text have been met with ghosting. If that\u2019s truly the case, I think it might tear me apart inside. However, because of this resource status, I\u2019m hoping I can use this relationship to my advantage as an excuse to talk to her more. Hopefully more in person. Maybe she\u2019ll get to see me in a more trusting and fun light and focus on me for more than just my help with our classes. \n\nThe resource\/partner thing is only one problem though. The other major problem lies in her future and us going our separate ways once we both graduate in a couple months. I\u2019ll move down south several states away while she wants to move to New York. From what I\u2019ve learned from others, long distance never works out.\n\nI think this relationship may ultimately be doomed to fail, but I\u2019m still willing to see where it goes, and progresses into, for the sake of my love and social lives.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678656329.0},{"title":"Girl [21F] I\u2019ve [21M] been talking to is friends with a lot of guys.

She says we\u2019re really good together but that shes not in the right mental state for a relationship right now. I truly believe she likes me, so has anyone ever turned down a relationship from someone even though they really liked them? Insight as to why and what happened after would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBackstory: We\u2019ve been friends with benefits for 2 months now. We met through mutual friends about four months ago, and then two months later she made the first move when we happened to be at the same club. As I understand it, she realized I was at the same club (at this point in our relationship we weren\u2019t really friends: we just knew each other so like we hadnt planned on meeting in that club) and went around looking for me. When she found me she warpped her arms around me and asked if I wanted to dance. We ended up making out for the rest of the night.\n\nEver since then, we\u2019ve basically been arranging to meet up every friday, whether its a club, bar, or just a small house party. We dont text during the week at all. Just on friday to make sure we\u2019re both going to the same place. We had sex for the first time two weeks after we made out for the first time, and ever since then we always go back to one of our places after we meet up on Fridays. So basically freinds with benefits. \n\nWe\u2019ve never really defined what our relationship is or had any talks about it until this friday. My friends know that I really like her. She's literally checkbox by checkbox exactly my exact type, she has a really great personality, and we just always have really great convos and a really good time together whenever we hang out. We have a lot of common interests, shared mutual friends, etc. So my friend, thinking he\u2019s helping me out, decides to begin talking me up to her when I was at the washroom. He begins saying how great I am and how I would be the best bf in the world, etc. He was drunk and what he was doing really did come from good intentions so I dont blame him or am mad at him or anything like that.\n\nAnyway, based off what he was saying she probably caught on pretty quick that I wanted something more than an fwb relationship. After I came back she looked pretty serious and said she wanted to talk. This is almost word for word what she said best I can remember it. It happened two nights ago so it's still pretty fresh in my memory. She said \u201clook im really attracted to you and we\u2019ve got a really great vibe and connection when we hang out, but im just not in the right mental state for a relationship right now. You know that I make out with a lot of guys and I do that because Im just not ready for a relationship.\u201d (More on the second comment a bit further down). I lied and said me too but im pretty sure she didnt believe me because this convo happened at the end of the night when the club was closing and this was the first week since being fwbs that she wanted to go back to her place alone instead of together.\n\nI mentioned all this backstory because shes always the one initiating. Shes the one that first started kissing me and every friday shes always the one that texts me first asking where we\u2019re meeting up or that she wants to go to this place tn.\n\nBefore we started being fwbs she was also known in her friend group as the girl that makes out with a lot of guys when she goes clubbing. Which honestlydoesnt bother me. Anyways, whenever she did this she would never ask for socials, or if they gave theirs to her, she would never text guys back or anything like that after making out with them. From what I know talking to other people, I'm the first person shes ever texted back asking to meet up again. Her friends even told me two weeks ago that since two months ago I'm the only person she's been with and that \"they're rooting for me\". \n\nSo that all comes to this. I genuinely believe she likes me and that she was being honest when she said shes just not in the right mental state to have a relationship. Like she wasnt just politely turning me down because she wasn't into me. \n\nWhat are your guys thought on this whole situation? Has anyone here ever turned down a relationship from someone even though they really liked them? Insight as to why and what happened after would be greatly appreciated. I know my fwb hasn't ever been in a serious relationship and hasn't gone through a recent breakup, so I also know that isn't that reason. I feel like Im being incredibly selfish with this line of thinking and its most defenitly because I'm personally ready to be in a relationship, but I cant think of many reason (expect getting over a previous relationship) that would prevent someone from being in a relationship with someone else they like.

We hit it off pretty well and she asked for my instagram. I said I didn't have one. She asked what I used and I said I used discord, and she offered to download it so we could chat. I offered that we could instead just text, and we settled for that.\n\nAfter debilitating illness for 2 weeks, I messaged her and we organized for a coffee. She showed great enthusiasm, including pointing out that she could make it wherever, etc. Unlike at the party, I was uncharacteristically nervous after various things that happened that morning. As such, the date was serviceable, but not as great as when we met (not to say I didn't enjoy myself, I was glowing afterward. More that she carried the date). Regardless, there were good bits and she organized for another meetup (longer-form event) a week and a half later (Sunday) and asked for a hug as we parted.\n\nTexting has been a... mixed bag. Neither of us are big back-and-forth texters, so there tends to be gaps between messages.\n\nFirst, I messaged her after the date and said I had a good time. We had a good laugh. Took a short break when we hit a lull in conversation (couple days). Messaged her about something we talked about. No response for a couple days before she brings up she didn't see it.\n\nAsked about the time for the second date a bit in advance (the Thursday before) and she mentions she forgot another commitment. She offers for the weekend after (this weekend). I say okay, but ask what the rest of her weekend's like. Get a one-word response two days later on the Saturday: \"working \ud83d\ude02\".\n\nDespite the emoji, I see the brevity and time between messages as a sign of lack of interest, but we've already scheduled for the next weekend, so opt to send a question closer to the date to confirm if it's still happening, but not going to force it \/ pursue it otherwise.\n\nI confirm that we're doing this weekend around Tuesday and ask how Sunday at 11 works. She reacts with heart emojis and multiple enthusiastic messages expressing that she's looking forward to it and has been busy. The enthusiasm leads me to take this at face value.\n\nAsk yesterday (Saturday) about some specifics for organizing where to meet. Get a message apologizing and stating that she can't make it. No elaboration. No reschedule. I take this as pretty cut and dry and so I say \"alright\" and figure that's that. Get another message the next day (today) giving a reason for the cancellation (last minute family trip).\n\nNow I'm in a funny spot. I don't particularly care for texting in general so I don't mind that it's been slow as much. The girl is a lightning bolt in conversation, funny, and gorgeous. Haven't been as interested in \/ immediately taken by someone as I've been by her in a *long* time. Thoroughly enjoyed both times meeting her and extremely keen to meet again \/ pursue a relationship. That said, I don't know what the deal is here.\n\nShe falls off the world sometimes and drops one-word responses \/ cancellations, but other times responds with a wave of confirmation and enthusiasm. I would expect if she didn't want to meet, she'd just not reschedule the first time? Alternatively, that after yesterday's cancellation that it would have been apparent? I never asked for a reason after all.\n\nSo we come to the heart of the matter. As long as there's a chance, I want to pursue this option. I'm quite infatuated with this girl in a way I haven't been in years. As such, I'm not looking for \"advice\" such as \"don't respect someone who doesn't respect your time and leave\" or \"there are other fish in the sea\". Instead, I wish for actionable suggestions on how to recover from this. I imagine that meeting in-person is the best bet (where I expect I should be able to carry myself with usual bravado). I ask myself if nixing the long-form event she planned and asking for a smaller time commitment event (another coffee, closer to her place maybe) is the play to rekindle things.\n\nAny advice appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678654588.0},{"title":"This girl wants to watch a horror movie with me and I have no clue how to prepare.","author":"Certified_Douchebag","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p0mml\/this_girl_wants_to_watch_a_horror_movie_with_me\/","text":"Ok so there\u2019s this girl at my school that wanted to watch this horror movie (John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, specifically).

I feel like when I meet these girls I treat them the same way I would anyone else, be myself, be kind, friendly and crack jokes. 95% of the time we have a good time but it generally just leads to us becoming friends and nothing more. I can usually tell when someone is into me and I don't get any sense that they are so I keep it platonic also and move on. '\n\nMy conclusion is that I'm too friendly and nice. All the dating stories I hear from my female friends are about these guys that are a little nice but also kinda of assholes that clearly have a roaster of girls on rotation and somehow they are still interested in them. Like they'll vent about them to me and still continue to see them. Which leads me to believe this is the kind of person I need to become to attract someone. I've tried being myself and it isn't working. Toxic masculinity isn't the way to go, yet most of the guys that are like this seem to get the most girls. Girls love the bad guy that is only nice to them so maybe I should just pretend to be that guy to attract them and then when they realize I'm actually not a piece of shit they'll be happy.

As you might imagine, all of our crushes were on the teachers and teaching assistants who worked at the school. Because of this, I've always been more attracted to women older than me, and I find that I can talk to them easier as well. I lost my virginity to a woman in her 40s when I was a teenager, and it's a chapter of my life I have never been able to stop thinking about. My relationship with girls my own age has always been awkward and tepid: at first they take an interest in me, but once they get a whiff of my ineptitude they distance themselves completely. This isn't a problem when I drink, but then I just end up being an asshole instead.\n\nBack in November I ended a year-long relationship with a girl two years younger than me. I don't think I like being the senior partner\u2014something about it just leaves me feeling unfulfilled. As an autistic person, I really want someone who can get me out of my shell and give me guidance in life. It keeps bringing me back to older women. I don't know if this is some itch I need to scratch or the kind of relationship I need for the rest of my life.\n\nSo I bought a month's subscription to [Match.com](https:\/\/Match.com), took quality photos and wrote a bio specifically aimed at capturing the interest of older women.

Especially since I have gotten some attention from younger women on other apps, it seems like this is an age thing. These women view me like I'm a little boy, which I something I've always struggled with: being seen as valid in the eyes of older women.\n\nAlthough right now I'm not determined to find something serious, I do want to have children at some point and that window is closing if I'm going to be with someone significantly older than me. There is a singles event coming up in my area which will almost certainly be attended by women over 30, but I'm worried that I'll be laughed out of the room for being young.

As far back as I can remember, I have always had a fear of abandonment. As I grew up, I became withdrawn, cold and distant, rejecting others before they rejected me. \nI later realized that this was not my true personality, only a defense mechanism, since then I struggle to try to express my emotions, be myself with people, and show them that I appreciate their presence rather than push them away. \n\nI have made progress, but I still have a lot of problems with my love life. \nRecently, I have been seeing a girl who I really like. As I have always rejected people, the only relationships I have known are rare and have been with girls who have approached me. \n\nSo I got attached to this girl quite quickly and now the fear that she will leave haunts me permanently. But the main problem is that despite my efforts, I still don't dare to be myself in this relationship. So I have the impression that she loves me for the way I look, not for what I really am. \nShe likes masculine, solid men, and I feel like if I express my emotions a little more, it would scare her away. \nAlso, while I was quite distant and didn't reveal much about myself, I managed to take a step towards her the last time we saw each other, thinking that she too must be suffering from the distance I was placing between us. Before we left, she had asked me shyly, hiding her head against my chest, if we would see each other again. \nI got the confirmation in there that she needed to be reassured about how I felt about her. \n\nI didn't make any fiery declarations, I only let her know that she meant a lot to me, slipped in a few compliments, and in turn put forward the idea of a future between us (something she had been doing since the beginning). Only, since then, she seemed more distant before leaving, and didn't contact me again, although she always does. \n\nI'm confused. On the one hand I have been struggling for years to get over this fear of abandonment and get into a more intimate relationship with others, on the other hand I feel that women are attracted to this kind of cold and distant behavior, and as soon as I try to take a step towards them, they flee. \n\nSo am I doomed to hide my emotions all my life so that I don't scare women away ? \nWhy can't relationships be simpler ? Why do I have the impression that it is necessary to play a game of manipulation on both sides from the beginning of the seduction?\nIs there a way to overcome this fear of abandonment ?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648245.0},{"title":"Girlfriend (F30) prioritizes traveling with friends over me (M33)","author":"Mathmania89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11pmvah\/girlfriend_f30_prioritizes_traveling_with_friends\/","text":"My GF (F30) prioritizes traveling with her friend over me (M33)\n\nMy girlfriend (F30) and I (M33) have been together for a little bit over a year.

My hobbies are running, lifting weights, reading, listening to music, and fishing, which are somewhat solitary, so I don't really find myself meeting new people day to day. \n\nThe Kicker: For personal reasons, I do not own a cell phone at all and have not for several years.

I mostly blame it on the fact that I was still sick, and my brain wasn't working on 100%, but I am also wondering what SHOULD I actually ask her..\n\nNext time I go to the supermarket, IF I see her, which is not a given, but IF I do, what kind of conversation can I have with her?\n\nHow do I slowly move forward with the conversation so we can get to the point where it feels okay to ask her out? I could ask her something about her job I suppose.. but then what? I assume we'll have about 5 min time for talking, so I need to make it count. So, do you have any ideas about what do I say, ask, and talk about?\n\nMy plan is to see her again, have a good conversation. Then see her one more time after that, have another good conversation, and then on the 5th time to ask her out. We already met twice, so 3 more times. On that note, do you think it's better to ask her if she wants to go out, or should I ask for her number instead? Obviously I don't know if any of this is even going to happen. She could even have a bf, I don't know. I don't know when am I even going to see her again, but I want to be prepared should that time comes.\n\nSome facts about her: she's very sarcastic and humorous. She talks fast and direct. She has a blue hair. She's a native Austrian, and I am not. Last time she said she'll start speaking German to me next time she sees me. I said \"not next time because I'll come again next week\", and she said \"next time **I** see you\", and then she made that gesture with her two fingers pointing at her eyes and then me :D\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678631382.0},{"title":"I dont know what I did wrong with my crush","author":"Taynit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11pl6z2\/i_dont_know_what_i_did_wrong_with_my_crush\/","text":"So I (M21) met this girl (F21) in a sports class.

We hooked up twice in the beginning when his and said gf were \u201coff\u201d. A lot of time had passed and I started to fall back and I guess he noticed that and started giving me more attention, he told me he apologizes so much for how he treated me, he loves me more then I\u2019ll ever know, he\u2019s never had someone care about me the way I have, he wishes he could be with me, etc.\n\nOver the last month I hooked up with him twice because of course him and this girl had broken up again.

I get checked frequently and everything is always good. \n\nI go to my std screening for a rapid test and I came back positive for THREE curable stds.

I made him go get tested and harassed him and went to the strip clubs he went to recently to see if he hooked up with strippers, for the 4 days waiting for his results and they were all negative\u2026we got into a fight again because I wanted him to send me dates and screenshots of the tests and I told him I\u2019m getting retested and I\u2019ll send him my results and he says \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore we can\u2019t talk or anything like that anymore I\u2019m done with you\u201d at this point I\u2019m so confused on what is going on and I decided to actually do a send out lab test myself, 3 days later all my tests came back negative as well. I was so eager to show him that I never actually had anything, and something had to be mixed up or faulty. I sent it to him and I basically said \u201c I just wanted to show you that I was clean and never had anything this entire time. I won\u2019t contact you again I just wanted you to know that this all happened because of nothing and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d All he replied was \u201cthank you\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t eaten much food in about a week, I\u2019ve lost 10 pounds nearly, I dream about him every night because I miss him so much and I really wish I didn\u2019t lose him in my life over some thing that was actually nothing but the way my hypochondria is I couldn\u2019t help but react the way I did, especially because that has never happened to me before.

I\u2019ve been focusing on part 1 the most so far: things I love that are dear to me, that my ex frowned upon. Like listening to my favorite band and solo artist on full volume, cooking by my rules in my kitchen without his criticism in my ear, watching my favorite show that he could care less about. It could mean anything for anyone, so long as it\u2019s something you loved which they didn\u2019t appreciate.\n\nBut I\u2019m coming to realize part 2 might just be a critical component to healing, if not more compelling than the first. What I mean is not shying away from the things you loved that your ex also liked, that you shared memories together over. I love this tomato seafood pasta, and he cooked it for us once which I\u2019ll always remember. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat the same dish, let alone cook it, for a long time. I would get those waves of sadness and break down. I gave in to the power he had on me and accepted that he robbed me of a source of joy, as little of a thing as it may sound. But I recently cooked that dish and felt the growth. I felt like I took back ownership and lifted this weight of feeling robbed. I\u2019m trying to do the same in all aspects and make choices based on what I truly enjoy, rather than lying to myself and giving it to this lost relationship that should no longer hold me down.\n\nThe 3rd part is tapping into what it is that you may have loved at any point in this journey, but either didn\u2019t realize it or give it the time of day. Maybe it\u2019s a hidden talent or hobby, a knack for writing or poetry, a goal that\u2019s been collecting dust on the shelf. \n\nWhatever it is that speaks to you in any of these 3 parts, I encourage you to explore that space and honor it. It will hurt for some time. It will feel silly or futile at times. It will even feel like you\u2019re backtracking into the past. But it\u2019s up to us to make the decisions, big and small, that shape who we are and no one can steal that right from us. Not today. Not ever. Please let me know your thoughts below!

He's definitely my type and has most all the qualities I'm looking for in a person. He seems interested, but he has been doing this dating thing a lot longer than I have. I'm sure he has met more interesting or more attractive women and it hasn't worked out with them so that's a tad concerning. I'm excited about the possibilities. He is coming over today just to hang out and watch a movie since the weather here still sucks for any more active dates. How do I avoid coming off a bit too excited? In general I'm a bit of a bubbly\/excitable person at times but I don't want to turn someone off because I come at them at level 100. Any advice about playing it cool? Or just advice in general how not to scare him away? lol","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678635329.0},{"title":"\u201cThe worst she can say is no\u201d and \u201cworst case scenario is you can still be friends\u201d are some of the biggest lies i have ever heard","author":"Andrew97FTW","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11o8vwc\/the_worst_she_can_say_is_no_and_worst_case\/","text":"Coming from experience these two phrases are some of the most made up crap I\u2019ve ever heard.

We talked for a while, and at the end of our conversation, he asked me whether I often come to the gym. I agreed, whereon he gave me a fist bump, saying we would see each other around. As I entered the gym yesterday (Saturday), he approached me while he was leaving. We entered another conversation, during which he asked for my name again. I also asked him if he could spot me while bench-pressing in the next few days, and he said he would love to. Once more, he said goodbye by giving me a fist bump.\n\nHe seems like a kind person in general. Do you think there could be more than a soon-to-be gym friendship? I am unsure if giving someone a fist bump and not remembering their name is a sign of interest. Of course, forgetfulness can happen, but I don't know what to think about it, maybe because I like him a lot. What should I do the next time we see each other? People tell me to take things as they come, and I am trying to do so, but I have been overthinking about him in the last couple of days.

The guy who I initially thought was my person cheated on me so I broke up with him in January. \n\nI decided to go on dates again at the beginning of March and had a great start that now ebbed down. Within five days I met four different guys and had four different scenarios with them:\n\n1. Guy approached me at a bar and payed three rounds for me and my girls. He also introduced himself to my friends and they did a funny little interrogation with him, questioning him about his motives and such. It was all flirty and fun and we exchanged numbers. He expressed that he wants to go on a date with me but didn\u2019t make any real plans yet.\n2. Guy I met through OLD. We went on a walking date. He was a bit stiff and I was freezing my ass off. I thought it wasn\u2019t great at all but maybe it was because of the setting. He himself didn\u2019t give off any red flags. So I asked if we should go on another date. He said yes but that he would be busy for the next weeks.\n3. Guy I met through OLD turned into a spontaneous ONS. The sex was absolutely great so I\u2019m not mad. I asked him if it was a one time event or if we could have sex again some time. He said he would also want to do it again. Sweet. Then no more messages.\n4. Guy (also OLD) and I watched a sports game at his place. I like him a lot. He\u2019s super chill, affectionate, and we had lots of fun. I stayed the night for cuddles. Since then we only messaged on two occasions. He didn\u2019t make plans to see me again yet.\n\nSo I get dates, but then the guys text me only sporadically. I get it that they\u2019re not really into me or maybe are not ready for dating. Fair enough. But still it sucks.

A fellow Redditor recommend I watch it. And the whole day I've been thinking of it and it triggered something in me. I wanted to cry watching it. I am in my late 20s F now. But when I was in college I had a classmate who was the \"good guy\" and top student follow me into the restroom and try to assault me at a Halloween party. After the attempt, he winked at me and said \"don't worry I wont tell anyone of what I saw.\" I told my girlfriends but they said \"he was drunk, he didn't mean it.\" The \"nice guy\" kept calling me and telling me not to tell anyone. He was very aggressive. I was afraid. I guess he knew I was a virgin because even after that he told me, \" I just wanted to show you what you were missing out on since you haven't experienced it.\" Today he is married and has a great career. I know he has a daughter now. I really hate him. I despise him. I really wanted revenge for a while.\n\nAnother classmate he was around 26 while I was 22. He was part of my study group and we had most classes together. I genuinely believed he was a good person.  He constantly asked me out on dates and wrote me a love letter but I denied because I only saw him as a friend. Fast forward to graduation, I find out he was married because his wife and two children showed up! The fact that he tried to deceive me and play a trick on me, hurt me deeply. It still does...\n\nI also had a stalker in college. He was in his 40s but he was a student there. He was so creepy and once he grabbed my hand and wouldn't let go until I told him please stop. I didn't want to make a scene. I went to campus police and they told me \"technically he hasn't done anything wrong, but we will keep an eye on him.\"\n\nAfter watching that movie, I don't think I will ever be alone with a straight guy. I guess part of me wanted to forget the past and erase it. In recent years, I've had other bad experiences not as bad but men who've tried to deceive me. \n\nI think is why I feel so safe at gay clubs or bars with all my group of friends. I rode the car alone with my gay friend, and while I was nervous at first, he is the only guy I've ever felt safe with. I really do love him. but How am I supposed to date when I can't trust straight men... I am genuinely afraid of them... and scared.

For the past 3 years I am really close with a girl. She has been something like a best friend for me. At first we were only friends since we were in the same friend group (at that time i had a girlfriend until the end of  high school). Last year, when we both went to university, we started coming closer and closer, to the point we were sitting for ours hugging each other and talking. And here starts the problem. Even though last year i really wanted something to happen between us, that quickly stopped. Why it stopped? Because i got anxious when we started talking for hours in video calls and generally we came too close very quickly. I dont know how to describe it to be honest. Honestly, it felt like we were together for many years, like we were married and that all this was just a routine. I didnt find anything that made me happy at that point. I started thinking that  i didnt really want her and since I didnt want to hurt her feelings (she is a virgin , never had a bf or anything like that) I slowly took a distance. That happened around 10 months ago. Since then, we havent stopped talking but in my mind a strange thing happens. Sometimes i feel that i really want her. Not only sexually. But when i jerk off and nut, that post nut realisation hits and for some fucking reason all my feelings fade away. I dont feel happy or that i want her. I actually feel shit because in my mind I think that I am exploiting her feelings. This feeling of course vades away after a few minutes and after some time i start again thinking about her. So for the past ten months I am in a position where I occasionally find my self in this situation. Honestly, it drives me crazy. I dont know what to  do. Sometimes I say \"fuck it, lets go and see what happens\" but then I say \"what are you doing you idiot, you dont really want her, stop playing with her feelings\". I dont know if i am afraid to engage in a relationship with her or if i only want her sexually. Many of my friends tell me to just go with the flow and see what happens. I dont know why i am stuck. I dont know why i feel this way after every fucking nut.  Yesterday we went on a date and we had the same things going on. Hugs, sitting many hours etc. I dont know what to do.\n\nHave you ever been in a position like this? What advice can you give? Should I go with the flow and see what happens or just say that the attraction isn't strong enough for things to work out???","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678631233.0},{"title":"Got matched by a girl(22F) on Hinge today but she isn't replying to me(22M) any further.

I love him, and we're doing good almost all the time.\n\nHowever, there's something that's bugging me. He has this trait that when I tell him I don't feel comfortable with something at that time, he completely stops doing it. Or when I tell him to do something 2 times he'll start doing it 100 times more. He doesn't know how to set things in the middle and it started to annoy me a lot. \n\nFor example, I really don't like french kissing in crowded public places both because it's not really appreciated in our society, and also because i just don't feel comfortable doing it. Sometimes he tries it and i say I feel uncomfortable doing it in that place, then he completely stops kissing me until I convince him otherwise. It's not like I'm telling him to stop kissing me completely, I just tell him I don't want it in that particular place and he knows that which kind of places I feel uncomfortable. \n\nAnother example:\n I'm used to videochat him when I'm about to sleep. However, I was quite busy these days so I stopped calling everyday. I realized he never called me, not even once. So, I explained him that I'd like him to call me too, that it felt bad when he never called me.\nAnd after that he started to call me 5-6 times a day.\nAgain, I explained him that he doesn't need to call me in every tiny break he took, I just wanted to talk to him before sleep. And then he got mad and told me \"I'm just doing what you told me to. You don't even know what you want.\"\n\nAnother example:\nI'm a very ticklish person, and he uses this a lot. I'm okay with him tickling me, but he never stops when I tell him to and after that it starts to hurt and I start to get annoyed. Then he gets sad that I yelled at him.\n We had a conversation about this and i told him that I don't like when he keeps tickling me even tho I told him to stop, so he completely stopped touching me around my ticklish area after that. He doesn't understand when i explain him I'm okay with him tickling me without hurting me.  \n\n Can you give me some advice? How should I approach him?. He's a sensitive person, so maybe I'm explaining the problem harshly? Idk what to do really, it's too childish for me. I know these examples are kinda childish but this happens a lot, and the examples are the first ones that came to my mind.

I know the girl is busy during week (so am i) so i dont really mind her answering when she can. In the beginning she answered quite frequently, with longer texts and answering all the things i wrote to her (in the times of the day when she should be the most busy keep this in mind). This weekend she started answering shortly, not responding to half of it and seeming uninterested. She was out with friends and i dont really mind her partying its her life but the way she presented herself is that she is looking for a potencial partner. Now i told her on friday at 10 pm to enjoy her night and and jokingly saying dont get too wasted haha..She saw the message right away. She answered yesterday at 11 pm oh i am just writing to you to know i am all right. Thats it. She was at the \"afterparty\" or whatever people call it so she isnt home yet. But i think that if you really were interested in me you would atleast reply me once in 24 h span. Is this done? I dont really wanna waste time getting to know someone who doesent get to know me at the same level. I dont know if this is \"hot cold\" game, her being a bad texter (which definitely shouldnt be the case taking into consideration that she was indeed great at  texting in the beggining) or her just keeping me as an option because she potencially found someone who she likes better for now (which is for me honestly kinda a deal breaker). How do i approach this? She seems like a good girl and i would like to maybe grab a coffee with her to see how we click, but as i mentioned i dont wanna be just a number for someone.

Making great friends, making great strides in my career. \n\nMatched a woman (24F) who is truly the prettiest woman I\u2019ve ever met in my life on a dating app, she enthusiastically wanted to meet up for coffee after I asked her out. So we did. Only before this I suddenly had a collapse in all of my good fortune:\n\nI suffered from a random bout of insomnia, getting only 2 hours of sleep; I spilled red wine on my only remaining nice pair of pants after tearing a hole in BOTH other nice pairs of pants I had only this past week. My deodorant didn\u2019t work even though I used it? Keep in mind, I showered well and thoroughly before the date, and I\u2019m often a very clean person who smells good, looks the part, and is well-spoken and coherent. \n\nCome morning of the date, I\u2019m on 2 hours of sleep, only have my work pants to wear and no good looking matching pair of shoes, suddenly I smell subtly like BO which is highly unusual for me, I end up being slightly late to the date because I was struggling to put together a reasonable outfit (honestly failed). \n\nMet her at the place, she was stunning. Well dressed, and by my standards, a perfect face on a woman. I didn\u2019t really expect her to be so attractive in person. Keeping in mind everything else that fell apart for me beforehand. The date went pretty well, our values matched up strongly and specifically. I made her laugh and vice versa. Due to my lack of sleep I had a few moments where I lost my train of thought which was embarrassing. We talked for 3 hours, then hugged and headed our separate ways. As we left I said we should do this again sometime and she agrees. I felt pretty good about how it all went. She slowly distances herself through text and today tells me she would rather be friends, so I explain how that\u2019s perfectly fine and I\u2019d still be happy to hang with her in that context, figuring I could show her a better \u201cversion\u201d of me when I\u2019m well rested and dressed, just more put together. After this she just stopped replying. Let it die. \n\nI can\u2019t lie, this woman really clicked for me and was the first time I kind of \u201cfell at first date.\u201d Usually it takes me a few dates to feel someone out, but it was almost spiritual how well I believed we got along.\n\nAfter this, I practically got home and literally prayed that this woman would be someone I could date for at least a while, she was so interesting to me, let alone beautiful. It makes me truly sad that she didn\u2019t feel the same. I saw a lot of potential and the way she naturally was so put together made me want to be a better person. \n\nI know humans are complex and unique and any number of factors could have played a part in her decision to nip it in the bud, but I\u2019m disappointed. I suppose I would like some insight from you all, advice, similar experiences, etc. \n\nFrankly I\u2019m just deeply bummed it didn\u2019t work out\u2026","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678605635.0},{"title":"What can I change","author":"HateHammer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p89hh\/what_can_i_change\/","text":"I (25m) have been single all my life, though not from lack of trying.

Recently I have felt like I am not attractive, interesting, and that people find me weird. This is probably because nothing has worked out for me during this fruitless journey. I have made sure to stay true to myself and talk about the things that bring me joy bc I don\u2019t want to pretend to be somewhat I am not. Unfortunately, I find my confidence to be shaky at the moment.\n\nI understand that not everyone will be a match or that you\u2019ll have chemistry with everyone. But it seems that I am in a vicious cycle in which I meet someone, text for a bit, meet in person, then contact ends promptly after. I know ghosting is somewhat of the norm these days and it\u2019s rare when someone tells you straight up they are not interested (which I think is nice to know instead of wondering why communication just stops). I noticed that I also don\u2019t get excited whenever I do go on dates bc I already know how it\u2019s going to end. \n\nCurrently, I met a girl at work that I don\u2019t directly work with that a find attractive. She would say hi to me when we walked past each other in the hallway, but I didn\u2019t think much of it at first, thinking that I would never get a chance to really talk to her bc she sits in a different part to the building. Luck gave me the opportunity to introduce myself and make small talk one day as we ran into each other in the hall. It was the first time in a long time that I got nervous after having that interaction with her. After a while I got the chance to get to know her and would visit her every now and then. \n\nOne day I worked up the courage to ask for her number, my heart was pounding as I walked to her office. I was pretty proud of myself that day, we talked for a while before I casually asked for her number. She wrote it down on a sticky note which made it all the more special to me for some reason, not sure why; since then we\u2019ve been texting on a regular basis.\n\nAfter a while I asked her to go axe throwing with me. To my surprise she said yes bc she hadn\u2019t gone in a while and thought it would be fun. I got a bit worried bc she got there a bit late that day, but things went smoothly during the rest of the outing. We got coffee after and walked around the town, talking about random stuff. It was a great time for me tbh and she genuinely seemed to enjoy the outing. Although it was a date, I didn\u2019t want to call it that when I invited her out bc technically being coworkers I didn\u2019t want to weird her out.\n\nI feel that I really like her and would like to take her on a second date. But it feels like the vicious cycle is about to kick in and ruin everything. I noticed that things are getting a bit slow between us, haven\u2019t had a chance to visit her at work bc I got busy and she got busy. Plus she doesn\u2019t text me as regularly as much but still seems interested. I think I\u2019m getting in my head at this point bc I asked her if she wanted to go to the aquarium, but she mentioned that her apartment lease is renewing this month and she\u2019s looking to move to a new place so she\u2019s busy. I told her that it\u2019s no worries and that once things settle down we could revisit going to the aquarium. I feel that this is her way of politely saying that she\u2019s not interested, but idk. I have to keep in mind that people still have things to take care of in their personal life.\n\nI want to ask her again soon and visit her again at work, but I don\u2019t want to seem pushy \/ needy.

My girlfriend has deep trauma regarding everything. she was never loved properly by her dad and her mum has bipolar which is already exhausting to deal with on top of that she her used to be friends bully her and her previous partners all treated her awfully. I came into this relationship expecting it was going to be rough and I know shes had it so bad and all I want to do is help her. For the last month me and her have been going through a lot and it hurts me so much to say this but i think I'm draining her and making her feel like shit. we don't fight but I say things which she takes out of context and then begins to cry and its been happening a lot and last week she told me that shes hates this feeling but she loves me so much and she really doesn't want to break up with me. i don't want to break up with her either. ever since i met her she has been nothing but perfect, she is so talented and so sweet to everyone and on top of that she is the most beautiful girl in the world. We do communicate and since Friday we have been limiting interactions because for the last 4 months all we did was hang out, talk on the phone and call and spend time together. it was quite literally all the time we were together besides work and when we got a break at work we would see eachover. we also have school we are both in year 12. we have both decided that the problem might be that we spend too much time together and we are just really drained and I'm hoping that's the case. we have tried to start hanging out with our friends again and slowly try and separate. this is the first weekend in 3 months we haven't seen eachover and it was awful. the problem with splitting up is that she doesn't have any many friends its only her sister which she has a really good bond with and one friend but she kind of doesn't feel like herself around that friend. i just want some advice on what we could do to get through all this because i really don't want to hurt her. I'm autistic but on the lower sides so it doesn't affect me as much and i also have adhd and aspergers. i forget things very easily and i also say whats on my mind all the time even when its bad and i dont think about what i say. ever since I've started dating her i have been working on it but i still occasionally slip up and it often leads to her crying and being angry. its not her fault and i dont want anyone to think its her fault. we both love eachover so much and even though she struggles to open up to me she has started to open up so much and communication is often used. we do use communication but we are both dumb and young and not sure how to communicate and what to do. i still love her as much as the first day i saw her but lately i can tell shes very hurt because she loves me but she also hates me and i want to fix that. i really need advice on what to do to help me get through this because i feel like at the rate things are going I'm going to lose her. i will update about how it goes after a week because we are starting to limit conversations over text and spending less time to aprreantly grow a stronger bond and we are still talking lots. I'm just a bit scared that we are going to spend too much time apart. it would be so grateful if someone could help me with this and give me some advice as i dont want to lose her.\n\nshe struggles a lot with her trauma and i want to make her happy. we still love being with eachover even though we fight. we just both want to find that love we have for eachover again and fix this because we both know its getting toxic. once again she is talented as fuck and shes beautiful but most importantly she is the most kind hearted girl in the world and even though she is so drained of me atm she still continues to love me to the absolute fullest.\n\nme and her would love to get feedback from other couples that go through this and ask how much space should we give eahcover and is space all we need? should there be other things we do because right now we are willing to do anything and everything to fix this. i would also like to know what i shouldn't do in this situation. this weekend i hung out with my friends for the first time in 3 months and it didn't feel the same but she stayed home with her mum. idk if this was the right choice but she said she really wanted me to go out and idk she wanted space. I'm not the best at expressing my emotions or comforting but lately i have gotten somewhat better. i can tell since she seems a little happier. but overall we really want this relationship to work out and we do both love eachover so fucking much and we are both so hurt. we just want to fix it before its too late and its gets way too toxic and way too much and we end up hating eachover and being in a really toxic relationship. it hasn't gotten to that yet, we haven't argued but we do cry over things all the time and we just want us both to feel better. I'm new to reddit but ill update you guys on the following week or throughout the week on how our space is going and hopefully it will work. pray for me haha. advice would be great, thank you.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678612869.0},{"title":"Dating a woman from work and from another country.

Unfortunately after spending the weekend together most of the time of the gathering, I had to leave back to my home country (we're both european), but we are staying in exchange with text messages and video called once. \n\nI told him about how I thought he didn't like me because when I first made a move, he didn't say much. He told me he is shy on more than one occasion, and repeatedly seemed a bit distant yet open, or didn't look in my eyes some times when I was closer, but was okay with me giving him kisses. \n\nI noticed that he thinks and feels very intensely but doesn't put that in words, I could see it in his actions instead (he was being cautious of me and generous, trying to help me and give advice on my work, being near proximity at all times when men were there etc.)\n\nEspecially in the early stages, I feel like he depends on me a lot to make the first moves (texting, calling) to give him security and space to even open up (which he does when I make the first advances). \n\nBut others keep telling me to let the man chase me more and to stop texting him first and distance myself unless he texts or calls first. \n\nI feel like usually that should be the case, but the dynamic started with me initiating, and I feel like it still applies in this early stage of talking.

We\u2019ll call her Millie. Millie and I have been super close over the years and were with each other almost daily over our entire highschool careers. When we first met at the beginning of our freshman year we fell head over heels for each other. Our problem back then was we were both too scared to admit it to one and other. After a while it fizzled out for Millie and she lost interest. I however never really lost that interest. I\u2019ve spent the last roughly 3 1\/2 years trying to build up the courage and figure out how to express my feelings for Millie. I\u2019ve been in multiple relationships over the last few years and I\u2019ve always broke them off after a couple months because I lose interest when I sit down and think about who I really want to be with. And that\u2019s Millie. She\u2019s one of the only people in the world I can fully trust and be my true self around. She\u2019s someone I can get lost in conversation with and not realize 8 hours have passed. She has always accepted me for who I am. Over the years she\u2019s been in a few relationships too and I was always the one she would come to for advice on her \u201cboy problems\u201d as she likes to call it. Of course I was always there for her to help her through whatever she was going through but every time it would really hurt me to see her with someone else. Over time I\u2019ve dropped hints here and there about my feelings but never nothing that was enough to tell the whole story. For a long time people around us actually thought me and Millie were a couple but every time someone would say it she would immediately rebuttal with \u201cnot ever going to happen\u201d (that also really hurt because she said it directly to my face during conversations as well). I have a strong feeling that if I admit the way I really feel to her that it will ruin one of the only solid and true friendships I\u2019ve been able to maintain over this portion of my life. I guess it\u2019s just a very hard thing to put behind me. It\u2019s almost impossible to get over it. Out of everyone I\u2019ve met Millie is the one person I can\u2019t get out of my head.

My school is basically homophobic to any guy who likes boys. No exceptions. I'm also very timid with people I don't really know, to the point where I panic when anyone there calls my name. I didn't want to embarrass myself so I would just wait for someone to come up to me first before I do anything. Eventually I gained a crush on this guy (I'm bisexual closeted male). He was kinda a jerk to me and everyone and he's cocky. Of course I tried not to do anything because well from what I've seen he's not rlly a good guy. Anyways from what I saw he didn't really look like he liked me. He actually seemed to hate me. Specifically... Like he would just target me for no good reason. One day I had to hide something because it was embarrassing but it was eventually revealed. In front of the whole class. He was the one person who didn't laugh. In fact he told my next teacher about it and why I was hiding it. In a normal. Almost kind tone. Anyways one day my teacher brought in a class pet. I haven't really seen it in a while and I like animals so me and my friend went to watch it and pet it yk. Then the guy I like (Let's call him ben) is there. His seat is right next to the class pet. We're supposed to be packing up and leaving class and he tells me \"You can't open the door without permission from the teacher\" I'm surprised he even talked to me a so as usual I start panicking and just let out a \"aight\". My friend tells me to hold on just for a moment. Ben wasn't having any of that and told me \"bro close it\". He then pushes me into a wall. Another thing about my school, if you don't fight back after getting pushed or jumped everyone is gonna bully tease and mock you. Basically, you need to do something back. I think I had like a 40% chance of beating him in a fight so I slappish push him into a lamp (if that makes sense). Then he gets up and does the usual \"Don't try me bro\" face gets right over me saying \"you wanna fight bruh? Huh? Try me. Try me.\" Nothing happens but through the days he continues to make more jokes and teasing about me then he ever did before. Eventually it ends and he goes back to how he usually was with me which wasn't great. One day I won a tournament but give the reward to my friend. Of course everyone starts begging my friend for the reward.. Ben included. Then I think maybe I could get him to be my friend with my reward so I gave it to ben. Not a thank you. I don't even know if he knows I asked my friend to give it to him. I think he knows though because after that he wasn't making jokes about me anymore. He talked to me once to ask for my burger but it was friendly like when he told the teacher about the embarrassing thing. Now, he's actually talking to me friendly and being my friend. He even complimented me on something. We've even played games together. Like, We're actually friends. At first I thought we were just friends. Then, he started getting very touchy with me and getting close (which I don't mind AT ALL). Then literally yesterday he was singing this song then it got to a part about love and he starred. Directly. Into my eyes. I don't remember the exact lyrics but it said things about love and wanting to be with someone I'm pretty sure. He's also standing up for me when people try to tease me. Something he would NEVER do before. Even my friends don't really do that. I looked up this scenario I'm in and it could be mixed signals. Psych2go said that this person COULD have feelings for me but they're hiding it. Off and on or cold and hot is what some people call this. I don't even know if he likes boys. And it's not like I can ask him considering how the school is and how do I ask him with it sounding weird or threatening or even like its a joke? I SERIOUSLY need help.  \nTL;DR  \nI (Bisexual closeted male) think a guy is sending mixed signals at me after basically bullying me since I got to this school where everyone is pretty much homophobic to any boy who dares to like another boy. How do I ask him with it sounding weird or threatening or even like its a joke? He sang a song and directly looked me in my eyes when it came to the part about love! I. Need. Help. PLEASE! Psych2go called this mixed signals or \"off or on\" or as some people call it \"Hot and cold\" But I don't know if it's even like that. Read full story to understand exactly how much bullying and other details  \n\n\nUpdate 1: Today he's on the \"cold\" side. My friends like to sometimes make up things to get people to talk about each other. One of my friends told ben that I was talking about him and if someone talks about you here you have to say something back. So of course he did and went on this whole thing. I as usual didn't say anything. My friends also do this thing where they slap each other on the back of their neck. Ben was doing it but specifically targeted me. I swear this guy is confusing me. Oh and he slapped my ass. So im screaming.  \n\n\n  \nUpdate 2: So yesterday he asked me if I was gay but sorta kinda in the same way everyone joking ask . I of course said no considering there were people all around me. But ever since I said that I feel like he's just been avoiding me and he's also not talking to me unlike before. I REALLY need to confirm and be 100% if he likes me or not so me getting closer to him and talking to him more was my only chance. Any suggestions?  \n\n\nUpdate 3: He closed my laptop as a joke (as he did with everyone else while they were out the room but me and him were the only one there) and then apologized me to me in a way that I can't tell was sincere or joking and starting hugging me. I'm literally dying. Whenever he talks to me I know I'm supposed to at least give subtle hints that I like him since I'm sorta kinda convinced he does but I physically can't. My face just won't make the face and my mouth won't say the words or anything. When he talks to me I become so nervous that I just don't express any feelings. Which may now be the reason he's not really talking to me as much because I said I'm not gay (Which he said in a jokingly way) and also because my face and words say that I have 0 interest in him which I totally do and there's also the chance that I could just be making this up and he doesn't like me at all and I am dying and really need some help.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678605345.0},{"title":"Emotionally unavailable","author":"Remarkable-Alps3749","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p7v6y\/emotionally_unavailable\/","text":"I have a question for all of the emotionally unavailable men in this. \n\nI was talking to a guy at the beginning of February who I started to really like very quickly like I really liked him within a week.

We were 6 months in & I brought up the conversation up of wanting to pursue dating & realized that there were many moments where it felt like we were a couple & that we were really becoming best friends, not to mention we have an insanely amazing sexual chemistry.\n\nI was so excited & have been so excited since I've discovered that we are on the same page. We've been friends for years & have always rooted for each other's happiness. Even though he admitted to always having a thing for me since we met(2020), I've recently realized that I truly can't see my life without him & have developed strong feelings for him these past 6 months. He is not only supportive & caring towards me but he is genuinely a nice, respectful, caring & mature man who brings out a side of me that I usually am too afraid to show other people. It sounds so cheesy to me but I really feel like I can be myself. We both shared how we feel so comfortable with each other & it is almost effortless when we spend time with each other. We catch up on each other's lives, watch movies, eat yummy food, & encourage one another on our mental health journeys...my time with him has literally felt like Im spending time with a best friend, just with all of the physical perks...& it truly has been the best sex I have ever had. Haha. He has always made me feel so comfortable & sexy in the bedroom all while prioritizing my pleasure.\n\nThings with him have been unraveling so beautifully in my opinion & we are both comfortable with seeing where this will go without adding on pressure of forcing it to work just because we physically have chemistry.\n\nBut how do I even date???\n\nWe are starting to get into the big dating conversations but I am also starting to realize that I have no idea of what healthy dating looks like...it's extremely scary to me.\n\nMy previous relationships consisted of love bombing, cheating & the dating portion of those relationships were so sped up just so I can be a girlfriend & fill a void in a man's life. Fast forward to now, this guy knows what he wants in life, has goals to buy a house & move out of state, & is bringing up some big topics in a way that is kind of laying all the cards on the table.\n\nOne of the main ones is that he is 9 years older than me. I see zero issues with this as I actually enjoy being with a man who isn't in that \"playing games\" phase of his life & is actively always working on improving himself through healthy outlets. The maturity in comparison to men my own age is so attractive. He mentioned that he already has some physical issues arising with his age & is balding. I understand that the older we get, the more we will slow down & looks & physical ability change over time..but ive always believed that the core of the person is what matters most. Outward appearances are just an added plus. But should this be a huge issue to consider? Are there success stories for having such an age gap?\n\nAnother thing he mentioned is that there is a possibility that he could be infertile. He's never gotten tested but based on a previous relationship, he never impregnated his ex even tho the amount of sex they had & lack of protection(with consent) surprised them both that they weren't getting pregnant. They weren't trying to but also weren't taking precautions to avoid it. I go back & forth with wanting children...I work with kids & am truly passionate about it so I am looking for ways to turn it into a career. There are days when I feel content with just working with kids & coming home to a dog & a loving partner. I also have experienced & seen so much abuse happen to children that it almost terrifies me to bring a precious baby into the world knowing they could possibly be exposed to its darkness that way. However, I do have moments where I can see myself enjoying motherhood & even with the way I've seen this guy treat kids, I can see him being a great dad. Is it something that should really be considered a deal breaker in my book if im not even sure about it yet? But there are also so many alternatives to getting pregnant that could this really be an issue?\n\nAnother thing to mention is that this guy has a handful of female friends. Over the years he's kept in contact with them in the same ways he did with me before we became FWB. As far as I know he hasn't dated them or had sexual experiences with them & he's actually told me a lot of the conversations he has with them. There are some friends he sees occasionally & one that he talks to frequently. He doesn't call any of them his best friends & also has a group of guy friends that he would consider best friends. With all that to say, I have experienced cheating in the past so I was used to viewing women as threats to my past relationships..sadly these came to pass & it brought a lot of trauma\/insecurity. But with this guy, because he was so open & honest about them before we even talked about dating & there was no reason to hide the truth, I don't feel as insecure about it as I used to years ago. The friend he talks to frequently knew about our FWB thing & was rooting for it. I don't really see these women as threats because I can see\/feel that what I have with him looks different from the friendships he has with them. Is this me maturing out of that \"cheated on trauma\" or is this me trying to convince myself that im okay with it? I do want to draw a line with it as far as him not giving the female friends the attention that he would give me as a person he's dating but other than that, I don't see an issue with it when I know the intention of these friendships & actually hear about their conversations in detail. Is there a way for a partner to have friends of the opposite sex in healthy ways?\n\nIf you have gotten this far, I greatly appreciate it. If there are any pointers, pieces of advice, words of wisdom, or experiences you can share with me, please do share as I have nobody to talk to this with & I do not want to go into this dating relationship so blindly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have always desired to be in a healthy relationship where I am able to be myself without holding anything back but I am just so nervous to screw it up or put myself in a situation that will cause hurt.

My biggest concern is with what occurred between her and another coworker of ours. Not too long after she got hired he attempted to ask her to hangout outside of work which she said herself was weird because they\u2019ve never really talked and it made her uncomfortable slightly. She believed he was hitting on her and wasn\u2019t interested in him in the slightest so she actually asked for advice on what she should do since she hates confrontation. I told her to give him the benefit of the doubt (even though in my mind I had hoped she wasn\u2019t interested at all) but stay on her guard because this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this. A few days after (I think it was literally the day after) he called her by a pet name which she nervously laughed off and again said it weirded her out, much more so than the random invite despite not really knowing each other.

And I know what people are going to say but if I didn't like this girl a lot I wouldn't ask...\n\nSo my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. I also noticed if I ever mention my (soon to be) ex she can get a bit quiet.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested\/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678602892.0},{"title":"CEO of getting ghosted 22F","author":"WeddingNo2123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11om9y9\/ceo_of_getting_ghosted_22f\/","text":"l've never been in a relationship (22F), but i've had feelings for people, and they were never reciprocated, I was always thrown into the friend zone.

The dates start off with awkward conversation which feels forced, but eventually we both relax and the dates have ended well... Kissing but no sex (of any kind).\nThere's obviously a lot of strong chemistry between us.  We're a lot alike in many ways- especially our core values, which is refreshing to say the least... But The AWKWARDNESS IS KILLING ME (I know he's struggling with it also). We don't talk everyday, but when we do, it's brief, to the point and I once again, it feels so weird. The attraction and chemistry is just as strong as the awkwardness.  I'm struggling to figure out what to do next.  The two options I'm considering are: 1) Be honest with him about us not being able to get past the awkwardness, and call it a day, ending the prospect of future dates.\nOr 2) Have sex, and hope we both feel more relaxed with each other. Our chemistry is through the roof amazing so maybe we should just do it to get \"that\" out of the way.  He did suggest sex on our second date, but I declined, saying I wasn't ready, which he fully respected.  On the one hand, I don't feel we should Not have sex if we can't have a normal, relaxed, 5-minute conversation. But on the other, I'm thinking what if we just need to get past the sex thing, and we will be able to move forward with the \"relationship\".  We have both verbalized that each other is everything we've always wanted in a partner so I really don't want to end it just yet. I may be losing my soul mate, or twin flame if I let him go.

I\u2019m not here for the bullshit echo chamber responses to make myself feel better, I want real advice.\n\nContext: I\u2019m in 7th grade, I am not \u201cpopular\u201d but I don\u2019t have any enemies and people tend to gravitate towards me. I don\u2019t have any enemies or bullies, I have had conflicts with others but it always leaves us awkward with each other when it is over, then we become friendly or friends again. \n\nStory I need to talk about: In the beginning of the year, this girl who I have talked to a couple times in the past added me on Snapchat. She was asking me if my friend had kissed his girlfriend. Then when I said yes, she was joking around a lot, but she was keeping the conversation going and going. It eventually ended but the next day she started another conversation, and she kept it going on and on again. So I tried starting a conversation with her, and she again, kept the conversation going for basically the entire day. This cycle went on for a few weeks. At first I thought that the first time was just her being \u201cnosey\u201d but she talked to me about other stuff. There was a dance coming up, so I decided to ask her out. It was the end of 3rd period, so when we were walking out of the room, I stopped her, and with confidence asked her if she was going to the dance with anyone, and then she fucking ran away. I was insanely confused, so my friend who had 4 period told me what happened. He said it was a no. Probably to preserve my feelings he didn\u2019t tell me how she was sobbing to her friends about how I tried asking her out, which her friends told me at a highschool football game a day later. Then my friends girlfriend (who we all thought was a terrible person) told me that I can\u2019t pull, which really hit me hard considering it was coming from my best friends girlfriend. Btw they broke up a month or two ago and she tried spreading rumors about him being gay or something, and then blamed me for spreading rumors about how she was using him, when it was obvious. Then I heard them ask another girl from the group how she would rate me, and she said something along the lines of a zero, and did the whole I would never date him thing. I was already upset, and now I was basically holding back tears. So when I got home I went straight to my bedroom and cried for an hour or two. I talked with my parents, and they reassured me that this girl sounds like a whack job and don\u2019t be upset. And yet, here I am now posting it to a public chat board because of what it has done to me lol\n\nSo basically now I have zero confidence in myself, I went from thinking I wasn\u2019t ugly just not super attractive to now getting depressed every time I see myself. I\u2019m not scared of rejection or asking out another girl, I\u2019ve just accepted that it will always end in rejection and that depresses the living fuck out of me. I know that is pathetic, considering it\u2019s just middle school. I\u2019ve long gotten over the rejection, but now I feel like it has made me question everything. There was this girl who my friends told me over and over again liked me, but I know she doesn\u2019t, and I can\u2019t even comprehend the possibility they were right. Again, I\u2019m over the rejection, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s put me into this spiral. It\u2019s not her anymore, it\u2019s me \n\nSo I have some questions. Also btw don\u2019t tell me that this was just her, someone else asked her out weeks later and she is now dating them.\n\n1. Why did me asking her out make her cry? Why do women do that?\n\n2. What did I do wrong?\n\n3. How do I get out of this loser ass mindset that no girl will ever want to date me?\n\n4. Why did one dumb little rejection send me into a spiral of hating myself? \n\nSorry if this seems kind of ranty, I just really needed to get this off my back and talk to some one and get some advice to move forward. Again, this isn\u2019t for pity. If there is something wrong I did don\u2019t sugar coat it. Be as brutally honest as possible. I\u2019m already at rock bottom with my confidence, so nothing you can say will bring me any lower.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678589477.0},{"title":"Got threatened for kissing a girl","author":"ThorOdinsson10","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p32ev\/got_threatened_for_kissing_a_girl\/","text":"Hey! \n\nToday I was out on a club dancing.

I couldn\u2019t say much to her but I was being honest and told her he sounds like a douche (how she described it) and she should forget him. We then went to our homes .. didn\u2019t know what to do really and it\u2019s cold.. we hugged and she liked it .. we flirted a bit throughout the \u201edate\u201c\u2026 seemed more like a get to know if you ask me. \nWhen she got home she send me a mirror snap showing again a little more like she does sometimes.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make out of this because she seemed so good and trusted me rather quick but I don\u2019t wanna be there as an option if she doesn\u2019t get her crush\u2026 which still seems unrealistic to her as she made that clear to me and how she wants to forget him. She also asked me if I found the \u201edate\u201c alright.\nShe seemed down to meet again. Where should we go, what to do? \nI forgot to add: she seemed like she wants to be serious in relationships\u2026 since she always loved kids.. she wants 2 and would not mind getting kids in a few years. She asked me about getting children as well. And how I\u2019m planning my future kind of. \n\nIll be happy to hear answers.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678587276.0},{"title":"Does anybody feel like most of the answers here are actually wrong and most of the time they won't work in reality","author":"williepep1960","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11o5h1a\/does_anybody_feel_like_most_of_the_answers_here\/","text":"I feel like this forum doesn't know how dating world works but at the same time i don't judge because most of the people who make threads here (not hating) either dated 1 in their lifetime or never so they don't know the reality of dating.\n\nReminds me of the book Don't be nice guy.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678493705.0},{"title":"Met a girl at a surfcamp","author":"TechnologyWorldly537","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11ox4vs\/met_a_girl_at_a_surfcamp\/","text":"Hi, \n\nAt a surf camp I had a female surf instructor who I thought was pretty cool and who I also had the feeling that we found each other attractive.

I (33f) am recently divorced (official one year) separated over two and staring to date again. I was with my ex for 15 years he was the first and only guy I was with so my knowledge of dating and romance and any type of affection was based off of what we had BUT it was very toxic, draining and miserable I'm coming back into the real world and I realize I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.  I go on dates, ilI meet people, I give people chances but I just get ran over. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and why I keep matching with these type of people I've spent the last year working on myself I got my body back in shape after my kids I lost my dead weight of a husband I have been working on myself spiritually and mentally to get where I think I need to be in a relationship. I am not built to jump person to person I don't care for the hookup culture I've had my fun the past year  but I just don't enjoy waking up to a complete stranger or building a relationship in a Friends with benefits kind of deal I genuinely want to find a guy that wants to be with me and only me but I feel like every single one I talk to has got the same mindset come to my place let's fuck and then on to the next and even the guys that I give a shot that I'm not completely attracted to that seem like they are not doing as well in the dating game  as most, even treat me the same way and I feel like I have a lot to offer I hold down a stable job I take care of my kids I don't have a crazy attitude and not always starting fights I try to be funny and playful but it just seems like it's never enough and I'm always going back to the same bullshit. I will say at first I attached quickly and was kind of clingy to anybody that would give me any attention but that was going nowhere and I was getting nothing but pain in return so I've slowed down I've taken time to appreciate being alone I taking the time to get back into hobbies and working on myself and I just want someone to be a part of that and how do I find meaningful relationships when the next girl is just another swipe away and how do I build a connection with someone who's got 10 going already and how do I find security knowing that they could just find anything at the reach of their fingertips I have a lot of faith in myself and trust in myself to know that I'm ready but I have a lot of trust issues with these guys in the past year and the hundreds of guys I have matched with (not slept with) but all of these men show traits of not being loyal most admit to cheating most admit to getting bored very easily most don't seem to want to settle down at 30- 40 years old they're still playing this bachelor run around lifestyle and it's cool for them...but how can I make myself more appealing and find someone that actual wants to be with me. \nP.S I may sound desperate or thirsty in this post but I don't come off like this or at least I don't think I come off like this when dating I try not to bring up my ex I don't talk about how awful the dating life is I try to just be in the moment and have a good time. It's not like I'm matching with over qualified men these men appear to be on the same page as me with kids and life but for some reason i was not enough for my husband he ran aroud while we were married and no other guy in two years has even tried to move past the dating stage. And the one singular factor between my ex and all of these guys is ME so it's hard not to take this personally. yes I know when it comes it'll come and you can't force it but I would at least hope that there would be some guys willing to want to fight for me or want to be with me even if it's not going to work but in the past 2 years of dating and putting myself out there nobody has given two shit about me or what I have to offer.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678586127.0},{"title":"Online Dating","author":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p1xwr\/online_dating\/","text":"Looking for Dating App Advice and dating advice in general.

I recently (about 3 weeks ago) hooked up with another resident who I was very interested in since veterinary school. She was on a research leave for two years and returned about a year ago. Since her return we were close for several months, hanging out, doing various activities, chatting just about daily via text. We had begun to hang out more at my apartment, and after a dinner prep\/dinner we started hooking up. As this was happening she was basically telling me that she really valued me as a friend and didnt want to ruin what we had, but also kept pulling me in for more. She also shared a lot about how she had been wronged and hurt by so many people etc. I care about her a lot this began to concern me; I stopped things short of having sex because I was slightly confused at the fact that she was simultaneously telling me that we shouldn't be doing this while also pulling me in for more. We were both moderately intoxicated at this point. At some point in hooking up she also asked if we were now dating...but didn't seem to imply that she wanted to date, at least to me at the time. She reminded me that we would have several more years of working together and didnt want to make things awkward. We ended the encounter with a kiss and an assurance that we would do this again and that nothing would change. \n\nSince this we have hung out, made out, but have generally been pressed for time. She seems slightly less engaged and is texting me a little less, but this is somewhat subjective. At the time I was kinda taken aback because part of me thought I was friendzoned forever. **I am confused as to what she wants, and I'm guessing that the answer is for me to talk to her about it, but I've generally not been in a situation where I've received such mixed messages and been so confused about what's going on. I really like her and am very attracted to her. I'm not entirely sure she knows what's she wants either. I am also worried that she feels rejected that I didn't have sex with her and that I may not have been vocal enough about why I didn't.** \n\nAny advice about how to discuss this or what to say would be appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678585417.0},{"title":"Is this normal to feel after a first date?","author":"C0v3rT94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p1qzx\/is_this_normal_to_feel_after_a_first_date\/","text":"So for context, I am currently a 28yo M with pretty much zero experience in dating.

Confidence has always been a struggle for me and I was generally never a good looking guy so it's been quite a struggle to finally get to where I am now. Good paying job, have my own place, and confident with how I look. I'm a PA so that's forced me to try and be more confident in social interactions too. Despite all this however, I've just never had any progress in terms of my love life. I've gone on a couple dates here and there but they've never really developed after the 2nd date where I would just get ghosted. Well today I finally had a date after another long period of time and I feel like it went really well. We text each other quite a bit, have a lot of things in common, we laughed, etc. Overall just a very good time.i paid for her dinner and got her number and now I'm just at a loss on how to proceed from here.

I got no reply after 24 hours so I\u2019m presuming she\u2019s not interested and that\u2019s ok but kinda hurts to just get dead silence. Am I being weird? Maybe I was too forward? Overthinking this perhaps because I got out of a really bad relationship a little while back and haven\u2019t dated anyone new since over 6 years ago. I hope I haven\u2019t made her feel uncomfortable in any way. I know 24 hours isn\u2019t a super long time but considering people check their phones like 100 times a day, she\u2019s seen it and chosen not to reply. It\u2019s not the end of the world but could I have done anything better?","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678458638.0},{"title":"Should you persistently pursue women with many options, even when they don't show much interest?","author":"Big_Seat2545","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11p5bdw\/should_you_persistently_pursue_women_with_many\/","text":"I've read a lot of answers on here, and elsewhere, that if a woman isn't showing an equal (or somewhat equal) amount of interest in a man, he should just stop responding\/pursuing her and move on because she's not interested in him.  I don't agree with this but would love some insight, especially when it comes to woman who have a lot of options.  First, I'd like to give 3 quick examples:\n\n1. I dated a model I met through school.  I moved and things fizzled out.  I hadn't heard from her in a year.  Recently, I added her on a new social media app, and she is texting me a lot, even double texting if I don't reply.  If I never made the first move, I'm sure I would have never heard from her again.\n2. Met a really pretty girl.  She wasn't showing too much interest (long story) after a few dates, and decided to tell her I wanted to take a step back, hoping she would text me\/show me that she actually cared.  She never did and we stopped talking.  I coincidentally ran into her 6 months later, asked her out for coffee, and things picked up from there.  Again, if I wasn't the one to make the move to reconcile, I would have never heard from her.\n3. Recently I met a pretty girl on a dating app.  We talked on the phone a lot, but it was hard to get her to meet up, so I just stopped calling her.  Haven't heard from her since, but now I'm wondering if it's just that she wasn't interested all along, or she just has a lot of options, and if I'm not going to make the first move and call her, she won't call me...but maybe she's somewhat interested and wanting me to call her.  I feel like the standard dating advice is that if it's hard to get a girl to meet up, just stop talking to her, and never reach out again.\n\nMy assumption is that pretty girls with many options aren't going to show a lot of interest in a guy at the beginning stages (for most men - of course there are exceptions), especially if they met on a dating app.  I'm guessing that a lot of guys, many who are really good with women, will still persistently pursue an attractive woman who doesn't show them a lot of interest at the beginning but don't talk about it because they're afraid to look like a \"simp.\"  Anyways, I have a lot to learn about dating, and women, and these are all just thought I've had.

Two weeks ago I reconnected, we went on a date, kissed\/made out, and I've been getting mixed signals ever since.\n\n22M here. This is gonna be a long story. I really really REALLY like this girl. Like holy shit. I have ever since met her. I met her when I was 16 or 17, through mutual friends and she'd hang out with my friend group pretty often. We're both 22 now and have had our fair share of toxic relationships before I reconnected with her. \n\nWhen I first met her, I instantly felt a connection. We started off as friends but it wasn't long before we were both crushing on eachother. But I was immature and insecure, and never made a move despite confirmation that she had feelings for me and despite that I had feelings for her. This is mostly because I was born into a very religious household, she had a bit of a reputation for swiping virginities, and I was scared because at the time I was going through a lot of religious questioning and wasn't ready for sex before marriage. I was too embarrassed to admit this to her, so our friendship and relationship fizzled out over the years. I still saw her occasionally at friend group hangouts and parties, but I thought she'd long since lost interest in me. Even when I left my religion and wanted to try sex, and still saw her occasionally, I didn't even try telling her how I felt about her because i thought I'd just get rejected.\n\nA year or two after it \"fizzled out\" we had an awkward situation involving me, her, and some other friends at a party. Basically, I thought she was trying to set me up with one of her friends. This friend of hers was interested in me and wanted to have sex at this party. The whole time I felt like my crush and everyone else was pressuring me into getting with her friend, but I just couldn't do it. I wasn't religious at that point anymore, but sex still just didn't feel right because I wasn't into her that way. All I was thinking about was how, if I'm gonna lose my virginity, I'd rather lose it to my actual crush. My rejection of my crushes friend just made everything way more awkward and everything just fizzled out at that point. We stopped talking completely. Honestly thinking back on this has made me accept that I'm asexual or demisexual, because even though I'm not religious anymore I still don't feel comfortable doing anything sexual with pretty much anybody. \n\nI'm not a virgin anymore though after a 3 year long toxic relationship with a narcissist. Although that shit sucked the entire time and had me depressed\/suicidal for 2.5 years, I learned a lot about myself from that relationship, about what I want in a woman, and about what I deserve in a relationship. After a few months of being single, I realized I keep thinking about that particular crush and how she's literally the only woman I've felt that \"spark\" with. I can't really explain it. Her personality is just one of a kind.\n\nAnyways. I messaged her after all these years and we went on a dinner date. I'm not exaggerating when I say that was the best date I've ever had. The conversations flowed, it wasn't awkward, it felt just like the connection we had in the beginning that made me attracted to her in the first place. We went back to her place and kissed for a while, she fell asleep in my arms. There was no sex, but it felt romantic and genuine. It felt like I'd just had my first kiss all over again. When I looked in her eyes it was like I could see into her soul and could feel safe to be completely honest with her about anything. I've never felt this way about anyone. The way she looked back at me and the way she smiled and laughed at my stupid jokes had me really thinking she's into me. She said she really enjoyed kissing me, that I was a good kisser which I thought was kinda funny because I'm really not that experienced, and even felt comfortable enough to fall asleep in my arms at the end of the night. \n\nWe talked a lot that night and shared a lot about how our lives went after we stopped seeing eachother initially. I told her the complete truth about why I broke things off initially, and that it's one of my biggest regrets because I always yearned to be with her and see how things go.  She admitted that she fucking hated me for the longest time because I broke things off and didn't communicate, and tbh I definitely picked up on that earlier in our friendship which is also why I didn't bother just admitting to her everything. I told her that I'm really sorry and she seemed very receptive to my apology. \n\nShe also told me that she's moving states in a couple months. And that she just wished I'd done this back in highschool. \n\nI texted her the next day and admitted that I still hold really strong feelings towards her. She was pretty indirect about whether she saw me romantically though, and basically just said that she feels bad because she's not in the right spot for a relationship right now. I assumed that's because of her moving states soon even though she didn't explicitly say, and I told her that I understand you're in a transitional period in life but that I'm willing to wait for when you're ready, if you see me as a potential partner, because I think you'd be worth waiting for. \n\nHer response felt like a huge \"maybe\" tho. She said I'm sweet\/cute and is open to hanging out again, but reiterated that she's not in the right place for a relationship. We've kept texting but It's been over a week now and she's continuously rejecting my date offers for being busy or having other plans. \n\nI don't know if I'm just impatient or used to how fast my toxic ex relationship proceeded, but I'm starting to wonder if I've truly been rejected and she's just too afraid to be blunt about it. I wanna wait for her, but it hurts because I don't even know if she sees me as a potential partner like that or if I'm just a fling. Or if shes just afraid of long distance in the future? I really don't know if I'm just not seeing the rejection for what it is, or if it's more complicated than that due to her life circumstances. As much as I like her I don't wanna end up playing myself and getting hurt again.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678581364.0},{"title":"Do people still ask people to be their boyfriend \/girlfriend?","author":"CherryBerry012","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11op3s5\/do_people_still_ask_people_to_be_their_boyfriend\/","text":"Do people ask will you be my bf\/gf?

I felt that too and I didn't because I was just scared of offending them or misreading the situation or something like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is: How do I be more confident\/bold in my intentions, and how do I read the room and make sure that the girl knows that I am trying to be a little more than just a friend (or how to flirt, I guess) and make sure that I am getting consent if I want to touch her in any way (kiss or touch her in general not sex necessarily) - both in person and via text?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678576889.0},{"title":"*Did every single thing wrong* If anyone wants further proof that medical students can be dumb af (me) then please read.... also help, I am so confused and sad","author":"FlowerPhilosophy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11oygkr\/did_every_single_thing_wrong_if_anyone_wants\/","text":"I (f, 27) met this guy (m, 29) on hinge about a month ago (February 9th). He wasn't even my type, but there was something in his eyes -now I know it was substance abuse hehe\n\nAnyway, we just hit it off so incredibly well. Shared about our childhood trauma and how it subsequently has made relating to others difficult. Both had 8 year relationships prior. He had been single for the last 2 years. He recently quit his job to work remote and travel more --so he is currently looking for a new job. He is very passionate about his work, and talked a lot about that. We talked all night. Then it turned into all weekend. We joked about how my bio said my talents were irish exits and tangential storytelling, and he said he tends to **run from love**.  Why did I not just end it there? Surely I should have. \n\nSunday rolls around and after days of having a blast talking, connecting blah blah blah, he decides to bring up being a \"runner\" again, things must've got too close for him. Then I don't hear from him for a few days which was fine.  He comes back, and we end up FaceTiming a few days later from 7pm until 2am.  This is when I find out he has tried every drug under the sun except for heroin, and he even dealt some to pay for undergrad\/help family back in the day but he doesn't do them or that anymore \\*except he smokes THC which is legal in his state\\* He also lives in what he calls a \"trap house\" but says his lease is up in march and he's excited to get out. None of this bugged me, addiction is complicated and people are nuanced, still really liked the guy. \n\nWe planned on meeting up at the end of my block (end of February) and continued to talk every single day until then. Sometimes staying up throughout the night. Snapchat, text, Twitter, sharing playlists. We have the same music taste, which really shocked me the most as music is everything to me. I sent him the Attachment quiz, and his came back as **\"fearful avoidant**\" meanwhile my attachment style was \"secure\" which makes sense because his mother really has put him through a lot. Anyway, everything you're not supposed to do, yeah... we did that.  \n\nLast week rolls around, and we plan on me driving to his city on Friday and staying overnight --he doesn't have a car because he lives very urban and the drive was a few hours.\n\nWhy would anyone PLAN their first hinge date like this? I loathe myself. I get there and end up staying all 3 days. \n\nI walk in, meet this roommate and dog. I kneel on the floor to play with the dog and find an empty bullet casing. I hand it to him and he says \"what is that?\" and I am like... \"well it looks like a bullet casing hahaha\" and he is like \"I don't know how that got there\"     ......HAHAHAH what? fuck.  very odd because both him and his roommate are very Lululemon vibes -Wearing sweaters, with their goldendoodle dog.  Anyway, we drink and play darts in the living room (roommate too) and he goes \"I really want you to meet John Doe (his best friend)\" so then John Doe comes over.  We have a blast. His best friend (who I had heard so much about already) said to me \"He really likes you. He talked about you so much\" \n\nThe night ends around 1am we both drank a lot, and we go to the basement where he lives, and this is the first time we are like actually alone. We are laying in his bed. I am super relaxed, but he looks so nervous. I say \"John Doe says you really like me\" to break the ice and he smiles and we end up making out, and while we had already talked about how neither of us wanted hookups, (I had never had a hookup) but by this point we knew each other pretty well, and so we sleep together. Both nights. I gave him oral sex. He was so cuddly and sweet after too. \n\nWe cuddle until around noon the next day, I mention that I might head out as I did not plan to stay longer (just to let us both have an out and reflect), but he brings up me staying for this costume party later, and so I do. \n\nWe get up, walk the roommates dog around the city. Never a silent moment between us. Then get ready to go.  He starts drinking again at like 2pm. We end up not even going to the costume party due to not having costumes hahaha --he said it would be weird, so he takes us out to get drinks on this rooftop bar, we stay for hours... we planned on going to a museum after but did not have time. He spent over $100 which I really wanted to split with him due to his employment situation. He refused.\n\nWe get home and his friends are blowing up his phone for us to meet them out but he insists on us staying in. We listen to music in his livingroom and smoke some weed.  We head downstairs when we hear his roommate + gf coming in. I find out they did a \"tiny bit\" of cocaine last night while we were playing darts. I was shocked. He said he did not do that anymore. I also found out he splits his prescription with roommate.  His roommate and bestie are not good influences that is for sure.  \n\n  \nThe next morning we wake up, and he says \"we should stay in bed until 5pm\" and I say I wish but I need to head out. We cuddle, he tries to do sexual stuff but I say \"no no no\" hahaha. He bought me my coffee and we walked around the city again before I left.  He hugged me goodbye, and then he pulled me back in and kissed me goodbye. He tells me to text him when I get home. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI instantly call my mom and say I had the best weekend ever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I get home and text him, and say \"let me know if you miss me in your bed tonight\" and he says \"I do \\*kissy emoji\\* babay babay\" which I thought was insincere...  so I just fell asleep.  Then we snapped a little the next night (I snapped him first), and then I mentioned something about cuddling and he ignored that part of the message so I left the convo on read.   Then the next day, I said it was a shitty day at the hospital, and he says some generic shit reply, and takes longer than usual. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen Thursday, I send him a chat at like 9pm saying \"Do you not miss talking to me\" and he leaves me on read for 25 min, which he has *never* done before. *never*. So then I just say \"I wish you the best \\*heart\\*\" and delete him because I am sorry but you can't do that to me after what we did this last weekend...  what the fuck happened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnow, radio silence.

I woke up around 6am and I volunteer as a sexual health educator. So I ironically spent the day teaching high schoolers about the importance of safe sex. I was dead tired after this ended around 3pm. \n\nI started getting DMs from a guy who is kinda a celebrity at my university. But he keeps his identity anonymous. We talked for 3 hours almost. Some of the conversation was sexual. He kept asking to meet up but I said I was tired from teaching and I already committed to hanging out with someone at 10pm. (I was supposed to go on a hinge date later but I told him it would just be a friend). \n\nHe kept saying \u201cokay no pressure\u201d but would continue to pressure me. Eventually I agreed to meet up. I just wanted to know what he looked like and who he was but I definitely didn\u2019t want to have sex. I was pretty tired and I also didn\u2019t shave my legs and was insecure about that. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy myself worrying about how I looked. \n\nWe met up near a park\/beach area. He seemed nice at first. He started asking sexual questions again. I knew I didn\u2019t want to have sex but I couldn\u2019t help myself from answering his questions, he was making me horny. He asked me if we should go back to my dorm. I said I don\u2019t know (which he should have taken as a no, I literally teach about consent and I know that anything unsure should be taken as a no). He kept asking and pressuring me. It probably took 10 minutes until I caved and said okay. \n\nWe had talked about slapping and choking. But I didn\u2019t realize he would choke me that much or slap me that hard. He just jumped to it right away without having any conversation about boundaries. (Another thing I teach in sex Ed it\u2019s important to talk about your boundaries, condoms etc first unlike what we see in movies and porn). As a result I kinda just forgot to ask about condoms I was more worried about not dying from the literal abuse. Yea it\u2019s on me for not saying no to that stuff, but I just felt like he was already pressuring me so much it didn\u2019t matter what I said. I just went along with it. \n\nEventually he realized I wasn\u2019t super into it. He asked me if I wanted to stop and I said yes. Idk how to explain it but I have trouble asserting my boundaries unless I\u2019m specifically asked. We just had normal sex without the slapping and stuff. Afterwards he was very insistant on not getting attached. He also didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone about it. He made me delete our insta messages and he unfollowed me. But he said we are still able to message on snap. \n\nI felt weird. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to go on my hinge date but the guy already bought tickets for a comedy show and I would have felt bad cancelling. \n\nThe show was good, hinge guy was really hot. We went to a club after and I got almost blackout drunk. I genuinely don\u2019t remember part of what happened. But I do remember guy #1 messaging me and profusely apologizing for everything that happened. Next thing I know we are in a cab back to hinge guy\u2019s place and then we are fucking in his room. Again I was too drunk to think about condoms so we didn\u2019t use them. Sex was good nothing crazy just plain vanilla sex\n\n**I stayed at his place overnight and I vaguely remember not being able to breath in the middle of the night. My head felt so heavy. I felt like I couldn\u2019t get air all the way into my chest. I was hyperventilating. My chest was tight. I started trying to control my breath but it was so hard. I asked the guy to give me a hug and I felt slightly more calm. He started counting to help me control my breathing. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before it was awful and embarrassing. The guy brought me water but I don\u2019t think it helped too much.**\n\nEventually I was able to get back to sleep. We woke up and had sex again and I left. I\u2019m back home now and don\u2019t know how to feel. \n\n**Tl;dr-** had sex with guy #1 who pressured me into it and was very rough with me. He made me delete our chats and promise not to tell anyone about the hook up. I felt obligated to go on a hinge date afterwards and would feel bad cancelling. I got almost blackout drunk. And I remember guy #1 messaging me to apologize during the hinge date. I had sex with guy #2 (the hinge date), then I had a severe panic attack in the middle of the night and he helped me calm down.

We were already fairly close friends before started dating. I was diagnosed with bipolar since quite young and he knew and accepted this since the beginning.\n\n**Issue:**\n\nSince we first knew each other, for a long while, I've been holding myself quite well, and the traits of my mental issue when I 'hold myself well' can be easily perceived as just slightly eccentric (and even endearing sometimes - based on many people around me) personality.\n\nBut then I hit a major rough patch in my life now and can't continue to hold myself anymore. I'm very bad at communicating myself when I don't feel well. So since the beginning of this year, I've been quite nasty to him any time we communicate. Think about having extreme mood swings, being borderline verbally abusive (we're both in arts, often collaborate, so by being verbally abusive I mainly mean me trashing his works and work ethics for no legit reason) and saying childish and annoying things like I'm a dickhead, he hates me, he doesn't love me and we should cut contact. He's still with me now despite that. Constantly reassuring me that I'm not an ahole and he loves me etc. But I can feel that he's also quite hurt now and gradually losing it.\n\nNow after a while my situation has become better. My mental status has also improved as a result of this, and after intensive therapy sessions. So I reached out to reconcile a bit this week. I did two things so far:\n\nI'm an avid baker and he loves almost everything I bake. In my rough patch I haven't treated him to them at all. So I baked a very lovely looking cake, sent him a photo of it, asking how much he wants. He responded saying maybe a little, and I'm always so nice to him. Added in the end for no reason that we 'get along so well' and he values me a lot.\n\nLater when I felt my mind is clear enough, I sent him an email (not short, but not so long that it's annoying) explained what's going on in my head these days, expressed that I'm sorry and I knew I've been awful to him as of late, I'll try to deal with this kind of issues better in the future, he just need to be there with me. He hasn't responded yet. I'm also not sure he will respond, because it's indeed an awkward thing to respond to, and he's generally very non-confrontational...\n\nMight try to go and visit him on the basis of giving him cake soon, though unsure when exactly because both sides are really busy and under big pressure (one reason I feel very guilty to not handle my situation better) these days.\n\n**My question:**\n\nIs there anything else I can do to continue to reconcile at the same time?

I told her that I understand but I\u2019m the inside im screaming because she is the only woman I can see myself with all I want is to grow with her. did i mess up and not try hard enough to get back with her?

I\u2019m from a small town so it can be hard to meet potential dating partners and have gone to dating apps for a large majority of my life. My intentions have been iffy at times whether I wanted something serious or not. Anyway, fast forward to current. I matched with a girl on tinder (I know I know) her profile said she was 20. We ended up exchanging information and have been chatting for a few days now. \n\nAnyway, come to my question I\u2019m looking for advice on; I have come to find out she is actually 18 and made the profile when she was younger. I don\u2019t recall how the information came to light, but she was open about it after it came up. My main concern is the gap in age and potential maturity issues. I don\u2019t want to be a guy who is seemingly taking advantage of a younger immature female, or playing off some age dynamic. I am very attracted to her and we share similar interests in things we like to do and goals as well. I haven\u2019t even gone on a date with this girl yet and am still wondering if it is a good or bad idea to do so. On one hand she is of age and why not see if anything comes of it. On the other, I realize the look it could give and as I mentioned before do not want to turn into some power\/age bad dynamic. Can offer more information if needed. Advice or insight appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678551086.0},{"title":"I want to know if these are possible signs that this girl could like me back.","author":"EvilestOfTurtles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11ot9fw\/i_want_to_know_if_these_are_possible_signs_that\/","text":"    We're both 16, and our birthdays are a few months apart. The situation is more complicated than what I will say here, as I am just wondering if I should interpret these \"signs\" positively or not. \n    There's another guy (a friend I don't talk to as much anymore) who is taking her to prom, but just as friends as others told me she didn't feel any type of way towards him. He obviously likes her too and tries to be close to her. He even took her out to the movies (which I did not find out in a very pleasing way) but I learned that he called it a date without telling her, and she didn't want to go alone and tried to bring someone with her who ended up backing out last second.\n    So, the other day I had a lot of stuff going on and wasn't in a good headspace. I went to go talk to her and the guy was sitting right next to her for a while, while she was doing a large word search and I didn't want to make it weird or \"competition-ey\" so I just sat in front of them and not next to her. I believe he was being way too close with her, (their knees were touching and he was hovering over her shoulder) but I think she's too nice to tell him to stop.\n    She's known for a long time that I have feelings for her, so she could tell that I was visibly annoyed, and it's hard for me to tell what she's feeling and how she's putting up with him, and with everything else in life, plus that set me in a bad mood for the majority of the school day. We have second period together and I didn't know what to say at that point, so I just put my head down on the desk and tried to sleep. I was thinking about a lot of things, so after second period ended and I went to my 3rd, there was a sub that day who let me go to the library for class time since she saw I was upset.\n    Well, after I went to the library, (where her brother is during third period) I sat alone and, while thinking about everything going on in life, I suddenly started crying, he got tissues for me and helped me out. I didn't know at the time that he also texted his sister about me being upset, which caused her to text me about a sort of misunderstanding that I was talking about her and the other guy from the beginning to her brother, which is annoying to her as she doesn't like drama around her or to be notified of people talking about her in those sort of ways.\n    Here's the part I've been wondering about. Her specific words were \"You need to understand that I don't have feelings for -blank-.\" and \"I'm just vibing through school and trying to graduate without relationships. \ud83d\udc4d\" After she said this I cleared up the misunderstanding and said how I understand how she feels, how I try to respect those feelings, and that I haven't talked to anyone about her in that way. We were cool and still sat at lunch together like usual. We text and snap each other a lot, and didn't stop that day either. We have a lot of things in common and I admire her for being hard-working and talented. Sometimes I joke a bit about boundaries but I never just randomly touch her or anything like that guy.\n    When people ask her about relationship stuff she tries to totally avoid the topic. One day while we were sitting together at lunch, a girl who has been very obviously pressing me, trying to get me to ask her out (we talk about it and think it's funny) decides to show her pictures of (obviously) way hotter (and older) guys than me, then asks her to rate them out of 10. She is very reluctant to answer and tries not to answer multiple times until she finally gives in and says \"they have nice features, I guess\". So I guess the question is, is this a situation where I could have a shot with her after she graduates, (she'll graduate a year before me) or is she just being nice to me and doesn't want to hurt my feelings? She'll tell me she doesn't have feelings for the other guy but I don't think she's ever talked about how she feels about me with anyone. \n    We've known each other for a few years now, so there's more minor, and one (kind of) major thing that's happened in the past, but she's not the type of person to dwell on that stuff so I think only recent stuff like this counts right now. This is not a crush to me, it's more and I'd hate to chase after her for so long and not end up being with her, but I feel like I'll still do that however it turns out. That might be a sucky thing to say towards myself but I know for a fact that I never have and never will feel this way towards any other woman ever again.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678564215.0},{"title":"What do y\u2019all think about international relationships?","author":"John_Boy_21","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating_advice\/comments\/11osxh7\/what_do_yall_think_about_international\/","text":"I\u2019m talking to a girl from Indonesia I met online.

I\u2019m a guy who is very cautious who I date (I\u2019m divorced and been burned badly) and don\u2019t even consider getting into a relationship very easily. I know what I have to offer and what I need so I\u2019d rather be single than in a bad relationship.\n\nRecently I finally was ready to take the leap. I\u2019d been seeing this woman (25F) with a kid for a few months. We live an hour away and she has her kid every other week so seeing each other was great, but not super often. Like 1-2 times a week. We connected so well in person, and I loved our calls whenever she was able to answer, and we texted all the time.\n\nEarly on we really hit it off and she started talking hypothetical future situations and making plans and I found myself buying in. And after each date she would always say how much she loved it and loved creating these new memories with me. She had said she was a good communicator, and it seemed that way. She reassured me when I needed it, and we could always talk about things in life we disagreed about in a healthy way. Things were going so well.\n\nOne thing that was difficult was that she would say that she wanted to date me, but didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship yet. And I thought it made sense due to her past and not knowing each other for super long so I understood, but it did make me feel a little anxious sometimes since she did it in a way that was a little hot and cold (\u201cI really like you and I just bought tickets for us to go to a concert in July\u201d, \u201cI think we need more time to get to know each other\u201d, etc.). But I was ok taking it slow because I trusted her and wasn\u2019t trying to rush things either. \n\nThen last weekend shit hit the fan. We had been planning on her coming down on Saturday and going to a play we\u2019ve been planning on for a month, and spending the weekend. On Friday night she went out with a friend who just got cheated on. We had texted about her sending me funny drunk texts and texting back and forth a bit, and I also told her to be supportive of her friend. Well she occasionally sent me some pictures and I would respond and flirt (usually within 45 minutes) and ask how it was going to check on her, but she would respond in like 30 minutes with another picture but without responding to my actual texts. I ended up falling asleep at 11:15 and she got super mad and at 2 am said she hated when I did that, \u201cwhat if something had happened tonight\u201d, and said we needed to postpone the weekend date. I told her the next day I was sorry and didn\u2019t realize that she expected me to stay up talking to her but that I\u2019d be more than happy to next time now that I know (she only goes out like 3-4 times a year).\n\nOn Saturday\/Sunday there was minimal interaction. On Monday she called and we talked and she said she understood me and that she missed me and was embarrassed by how she reacted. Then after the call she texted and said she missed me and said she could come down this weekend. I felt things were better. Then Tuesday morning she texted me good morning, called me babe, and said she was thinking of me. I responded and said I was too and asked how her day went. She said it was the anniversary of one of her friends deaths and that she was super anxious. So I asked what I could do and if she wanted to talk and she said maybe a call later. After work I went to see Creed and texted her to say we needed to go together, and all she said was \u201cyeah\u201d. Then I tried calling her and she sent it to voicemail after 2 rings. I texted her saying I called her to check in that I was thinking about her, and said to call me back when she could. All she did was like the message and I never heard back.\n\nThis kind of communication is a dealbreaker since I need to be with someone who can communicate and work through unintentional miscommunication and pain that happens. Looking back I can\u2019t really see any red flags to avoid this, but it\u2019s so frustrating because a small part of me keeps saying that maybe I could have done something better and that this past week was just a one time bad communication (I know it\u2019s not) and I keep reliving the conversations and also looking at the lost plans we had made and get sad. I obviously don\u2019t want to be in a relationship like this and I never will be, but my old anxious attachment is coming out and I\u2019m just frustrated at myself for it. I feel like I wasted so much time and energy only to be completely lied to, and it makes me feel like a horrible judge of character. Has anyone else been there and have any advice?\n\n\nTL;DR Great potential with this woman and dated for some months. She got upset I didn\u2019t stay up texting her all night when she was out drinking with her friend. Ended up apologizing and calling me babe again, making plans, only to then ghost me. How do I not let this happen again?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678561390.0},{"title":"UPDATE: I realized we\u2019re nothing but fwb.

We seemed to have a good connection and she later thanked me for the evening, saying she had a very good time. \n\nThree days later (last Monday, so about 5 days ago) I was looking at the museum exhibitions in our city and found one that seemed interesting , so I texted her that I hoped things were going well on her side and asked her if she would be interested in going to the exhibition next Friday or Saturday and grabing a bite. She told me that things were going well and added that she had a good time on our date and that she would be interested in us seeing each other again, but that her last days at work had been exhausting and that she needed to take some time for herself this week. I replied that I understood and that I appreciated her honesty. I suggested we go another time if she was interested in the exhibition. I ended the message telling her to take care for now and suggested that we talk about it later, when she would feel ready.\n\nNow most of the week has gone by and she hasn't replied yet, so I was wondering if I ask her how she's doing or if it would be better to wait for her reply.

Recently I brought up marriage, like if they want it in the future or not. As I'm quite serious in my relationships and I don't like having \"flings\" or what not. Now, I understand having a special interest or being really into something isn't weird or wrong, personally I am really into quite a few things.

I also enjoy escaping the real world but if you have people that care about you, and you care about them, shouldn't they be more important than, in this case. A kpop star. Or just kpop groups in general. When I brought up marriage and expressed that I'd like to grow old with someone one day and settle down and have kids with that person. They said that they only want that with one person, that being a kpop star. They said it with a straight face too and I kind of asked if they were serious and they most CERTAINLY were.

I've only slept with a few people and just started taking dating seriously recently.\n\nWe (30\/F)(28\/M) matched on a dating app and met for drinks 2 days later. I noticed she was a pretty mixed texter, sometimes texting a lot, other times responding with 2 or 3 words. Anywho, our first date went well, ended with a kiss, and we both wanted to meet again.\n\n2nd date went good and we ended up back at her place, though she made it clear she wanted to take things slow. We did some touching but she stopped things before anything very sexual happened. I stayed over, we scheduled the next date, and she texted me a LOT the day after, despite saying on the date that she wasn't a big texter in general.\n\nWe had a 3rd date. Ended up at hers again and we sorta had sex, as in I managed to get it in for 2 seconds before going soft, after which we did hand stuff though neither of us finished. She made it clear that me going soft didn't bother her and she knew it could happen. We cuddled like crazy and I suggested going steady, which she agreed to. Next day, I got quite a few chit-chatty texts from her like last time.\n\nThis last week though, she's been weird. I initiated contact both times, and while she's responded and without delay, her replies have been short. I scheduled another date which she agreed to, although her messages were short and seemed pretty cold, and she got a bit pissed off that I didn't buy the tickets for both of us to the event we planned to go to; I'd assumed we'd get our own. She canceled the next day cus a storm hit our part of the country, but my gut told me that she wasn't that enthused to go to begin with. She did mention having a shitty week at work, which is probably a factor but still, why agree to go in the first place then if you're in a bad mood?\n\nI've gone on a trip to another country for the weekend. After she cancelled our date I said we'd do something when I get back, to which she replied with just a smile emoji, which I found very mixed. That was 4 days ago; she hasn't text me at all, meaning re-initiating contact will again be up to me. I feel that after you've been on a few dates, a girl should be initiating contact at least now and again, although maybe it can differ... Again, lack of experience showing here.\n\nI dunno, Reddit. Has she lost interest, or are mixed messages like this normal? I'll admit, this is the first time I've gotten past a 3rd date in quite a few months, so I am acting kinda anxious. I checked my dating app (I currently have my profile turned off) and I've noticed that her location still changes time to time, so she definitely still opens it.\n\nWould like some advice on whether I still have a shot and what I should do. Thanks.\n\nTl;dr -- Been on 3 dates with a girl. She seemed reasonably enthusiastic until the last week, when she agreed to a 4th date but her responses have been way shorter and colder than normal. She cancelled due to bad weather and I said we'd do something when I get back from my trip, which she replied to with just a smile emoji. I'm pretty sure she still checks her dating apps despite us going steady. We got somewhat sexual on our 3rd date.

I'm trying to meet someone to date, form a bond with and hopefully a relationship with and in all honesty, I really do love going out by myself. In a lot of ways, it's easier (way less fun) to meet people. BUT, I also feel like there is a negative stigma towards men who go to bars or restaurant bars by themselves.. I enjoy being a regualr at a bar because I get to know the staff, befriend the bartenders and other regulars and am quite good at it lol.\n\nI honestly dgaf what anyone thinks of me going to bars solo because I have zero problems making friends with anyone - men and women or the occasional MtF.  But at the same time, I also feel like any woman who sees a guy on his own is thinking \"he's out looking for someone to hook up with,\" which ok... isn't entirely a lie for me but, that's also not what I ultimately want, am looking for, or trying to get. I'm not, nor have ever been someone who is into hookups. If it happens, ok cool but it's the last thing I want or go after. I genuinely want something serious.\n\nI've met so many women at bars who I'm actually attracted to that turns into nice, casual conversations and if all is going well, then I'll see if she wants to continue talking and get her number or something. My problem is is that I'm a natural introvert and more on the shy side. I know I could join clubs and things like that but, I'm hard to get to know and doing things by myself is difficult for me to like, truly open up without one of my more extroverted friends.\n\nBefore anyone says you'll never meet a quality woman at a bar... I strongly disagree with you. If you go to a bar, or have ever been to one, do you consider yourself to be \"low quality?\" If not, then my point is made. Almost everyone has been, or goes to some sort of bar. That doesn't mean everyone there is some low life drunk trying to find easy sex or has no morals\/values\/respect. I'm also 35. I'm not going to college bars lol...\n\nFor the record... I'm an above average looking, attractive man with a great personality though am on the introverted\/shy side.

Just to resurface with some stupid excuse about work and then the \"next week\" cycle continues. wtf?\n\nMost recently, a different guy (who I thought was the sweetest of all these) started acting strangely when I told him one day that he was \"on my mind\" and that I was excited to see him again. I thought I was being flirty and cute, and he often tells me, \"I like you,\" all lovey. He was also the one who initiated our dates and often asked to see me for quick coffee down the street if we had time. He would also call and text and all sorts of stuff.

Mostly because he'd ask me and I'd be busy with exam, in that case, I'd always inform him beforehand. But 8\/10 times he'd be the one to cancel without giving me any warning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought that he was trying to ghost me by not agreeing to my plans so I stopped, but then he'd call me, ask me to meet and then not show up. For example, he'd call me for a walk the next day, I'd agree and ask him if he's actually free, he'd say yes. The next day, I call\/text around the time we agreed to meet, he'd either be unresponsive or say that he's busy with a test or class. I didn't understand why he couldn't inform me about this beforehand, I mean, that's basic decency, especially if he's the one to make this plan. This happened a bunch of times and I got frustrated because I'd block that part of my day for it and this guy was being rude and disrespectful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I honestly gave up on it, wasn't initiating any conversation, until Tuesday. I saw him at an event but couldn't interact so I texted him asking if it was actually him. Whilst waiting for his reply, I realised that we didn't follow each other on instagram anymore, he removed me from his account and removed himself from mine. I was almost okay with it until he texted me back and was responding normally. He even called to ask to meet him the next day. I laughed and said that he'd probably be busy doing something, to which he said that he'll actually call me and we'll meet. I said okay, and as expected, he didn't call. That was the last straw (I feel like I gave him too many chances to not respect me). I didn't bother texting. BUT, he called me again today, twice. I didn't answer because what the hell. He then texted me asking if I want to go to a club, haven't replied to that either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't understand what he wants from me, or what he's trying to do? If he wanted to ghost me then why make plans, why call me? If he didn't want to ghost me then why unfollow on instagram, why no follow-ups on the plans HE made? Honestly, I was a little hurt earlier, just a bit, I got over it. Now I'm just confused about what this man wants from me, what is he planning to do? I'm fairly new to dating, especially dating apps and stuff, so I don't know the common asshole patterns found in these situations. I don't mind people ghosting me, understandable, I'd do the same if we didn't connect enough, but this back and forth is really just confusing and immature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm half-minded to just tell him off, ask him why he's being so weird and to not contact me again but I don't know if I should bother. I have the tendency of rationalising things for people and giving them a hundred chances.

Last night I had my date with a girl that I've been seeing on bumble for the past one week. She was pretty and I liked her. She opened up about her past and said clearly about her relationship. Before this date for the past one week we had been connected over call and text regularly. However, on the date night we were not able to create that vibe and comfort that we had on call\/text. I was asking her repeated things which I had to her over a call. \n\nFast forward to the date, we went to a cafe and it was snowing (my luck is pathetic). I asked her to hold her hand and she clearly denied it saying this means something significant and important to her. It was embarrassing for me and then I didn't make any moves. I genuinely wanted to make her comfortable and make her smile. She was from her face, a bit disappointed\/annoyed. It looked like I was dragging the conversation at the end. \n\nAfter our last drink, we had our last drink and I was dropping her off to the bus stop, I asked her about the date and what's her opinion on me. She said she will text me and didn't. I asked her if we could connect over a call and I wanted to discuss a few important things. She said she was tired and sleepy. Later on, I checked she was awake (since she saw my insta story) and still didn't respond to the text. \n\nI'm confused what should I infer from this? Should I say no to her? Is this relationship dead? Did I blew up my date? \n\nAlso, we are mostly (decided before our first date) going for the second date tomorrow but given things happened does this mean the second date won't happen? \n\nAlso, we just hugged during our first and last meet.

My feelings snowballed over the last year culminating this week after spending above average time together. I would like to confess, but I'm afraid I would ruin the friendship or make her feel uncomfortable. What should I do?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello! I am posting via throwaway since I want to keep this problem a secret.\n\nI met my friend 3 years ago when we first got to college. I didn't think much about her because the first year was right in the middle of Covid and everything was online. We started to interact more during our second year when normal classes continued. We take simmilar daily route via bus to and from college and we started having conversations whenever we crossed paths or between our classes.\n\nThis way I really got to be close with her and realised we have a lot of similarities. We both open up easily, we have similar interests, we are both not very social and we can relate to a lot of each other\u2019s life experiences. My conversations with her flow very smoothly and often I just like listening to her talk about herself or something she likes. I also find her very intelligent, funny, cute and beautiful. We did hang out outside these contexts but only a couple of times. This all lead to me developing a little crush on her which slowly snowballed into somewhat stronger feelings. I would often think about her in bed or while daydreaming.\n\nThese feelings got more intense over the course of last week. I haven't seen her in a while since some of our college courses require some previous courses as prerequisites. This week, as new course started, some of my other friends I usually take a bus weren't available and I went with her for several days in a row, I really liked spending this much time with her, but I suddenly realised I really wish for us to be something more than just friends. When I asked her if she minded me in her company, she answered that she doesn't mind at all and that she really loves these conversations. I, however, can't escape the feeling of wanting more than just friendship. Last night I cried in my bed thinking about her.\n\nAnd here comes the issue:\n\nPart of me really wants to express my feelings and see how it turns out. I really don't want to regret not telling her how I feel.\n\nBut another part of me is really afraid this will ruin our friendship. I really don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, manipulated or coerced. This makes me feel guilty about my feelings.\n\nIf I knew she would say no but be chill and understanding and happy to still be friends, I would confess in a heartbeat, but I don't.\n\nSo, what would people here advise me to do in this situation?
