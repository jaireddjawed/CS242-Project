So I’ve gone to another till, scanned it all again, went to get my money out to pay again and low and behold my money isn’t where I put it. \n\nI walked home thinking I forgot to bring the money with me, except when I got home it was clear I hadn’t left the money. So I went back out, retraced my steps all the way to Asda and back on both sides of the road. Nothing. \n\nSo I walked around 2 miles, spent half an hour shopping and my last £15, just to come back empty handed and have to literally starve until Monday. Talk about self sabotage.",
