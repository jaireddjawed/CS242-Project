        "author": "YahwehSabaoth",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3cw5r0/in_which_united_states_is_the_legitimate/",
        "text": "Found this on some weird white supremacist website.\n\nhttp://www.nightlycitizen.com/2015/07/the-united-states-of-america-in-bible.html\n\nRight, so this appears to be a variant of the old \"British Israelism\" philosophy, which held that the Anglo-Saxon peoples were descended from ancient Israelites. Except this is somehow more ridiculous. \n\n&gt;We will take the reader back in time to the days of Enoch and Job. In that day, Enoch took 144,000 Savants of the Adamic race into the land we know today as Egypt. There they built a great city called “On”. It had the libraries and centers of learning. The race of people brought by Enoch were known by several names as time progressed. These were Ar-ya, which means sons of Yah.\n\nI have no idea where he got this. I'm pretty sure he just pulled the 144,000 number out of the Book of Revelation and set it back a few thousand years. I'm also almost certain the Bible says nothing about Enoch except that \"he walked with God and then God took him\". Maybe he's getting this out of the Book of Enoch.\n\n\"Ar-Ya doesn't mean \"Sons of Yah\" in either Egyptian or Hebrew.\n\n&gt;The race had a Priesthood in Egypt known as the “Order of the Masonos”. Their symbol was the Square and the Compass as they were known as the “Builder Race”\n\nFreemasons are about 4000 years older than previously thought, I suppose. Those sneaky bastards.\n\n&gt; As time progressed, these men went to the Isles we know as Britain and there became known as the Druids and Culdees. They built Stonehenge for the measurement of the heavens and were also known as Astronomer Priests. They built the same circle of stones at Carnac in Brittany and the Do-rings of Persia.\n\nSOURCE. SOURCE DESPERATELY NEEDED.\n\n&gt;It was from this background that Abram came on the scene many hundreds of years later. We see Abram leaving the land of Ur of the Chaldees (Chaldeans) where Nimrod was Prime Minister. God told Abram to leave that land and his seed would be blessed. “Of thy seed shall I make many nations”. A “nation” is a family with a King.\n\nJesus.\n\nOkay first of all, going by Biblical chronology, Nimrod predated Abraham by a few hundred years.\n\nSecond of all;\n\n&gt;where Nimrod was Prime Minister.\n\n&gt;Nimrod\n\n&gt;Prime Minister\n\n&gt;In like 2000 BCE\n\nHoly shit.\n\n&gt;We then follow the story of Abraham and see that he had Isaac. The word Saxon stems from Isaac’s-sons.\n\nNo, no it doesn't. It means something like \"Knife\" IIRC.\n\n&gt;Isaac had Jacob and Esau but Esau lost the inheritance because he went out and took Canaanite wives. \n\n~~Actually I'm pretty sure it's because he sold it for a bowl of soup. Not the brightest bulb in the box.~~\n\nI have been informed that Esau's marrying Canaanites was indeed an important reason for his being cut out of inheritance. You win this round crazy British Israelite person.\n\n&gt;Jacob married into his own race (the Adamic race) and was therefore blessed and his name was changed to an ancient title used in the days of Enoch. This title is three words, Ish-Ra-Eli, which means issue or progeny, ruling with God. Ish means progeny, Ra means to rule and Eli was an ancient name for the modern word “God”.\n\nFuck that's a butchered etymology. No, Israel means \"he who wrestles with God\". I'm fairly certain he just made this shit up on the spot. I'm also fairly certain the name \"Israel\" wasn't \"an ancient title from the days of Enoch\", but rather originated with Jacob.\n\n&gt;It was by divine direction that Moses led them out of Egypt. When they set camp, the tribe of Levi was placed in the center, three tribes were on the East, three on the West, three on the North and three on the South. Each tribe had its standard before its tents and the twelve standards of the tribes of Israel are the twelve signs of the Zodiac.\n\nWhat? I'm like 99% sure the Zodiac signs don't come from Israel.\n\n&gt;A study of Scandinavian history will reveal that the great Viking Kings had the standards of the tribes of Israel behind their great banquet tables. They must have known their ancestry!\n\nSource needed, again.\n\n&gt;We return to God’s promise that Abraham’s seed were to become many nations. As they had one King (God) over them, they asked for men-Kings. God warned them of the trouble this would cause but gave them their wish. They then began to violate God’s laws for government. He said that they were a stiff-necked, stubborn people and prescribed a punishment period for them. This is known theologically as the 7-Times punishment prophecy. In the days of Solomon, God divided them into two nations and then set their punishment or captivity in the wilderness as 7-Times and then each would become a new nation. \n\nDon't think that prophecy is in the Bible. \n\nHe goes on to count the dates from \"each Israelite tribes captivity\" to the date when supposedly the new nation born from each came into existence. For example, Denmark=Tribe of Dan. Only problem is the Tribes of Israel weren't all taken into captivity at different times, rather, ten of them were taken at once when the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel, and the two remaining were taken when the Babylonians captured the Kingdom of Judah. So this falls flat on its face.\n\n&gt;We now go back to the days of Enoch in Egypt and the Great Pyramid. On its base we find the numbers 1776, inscribed thousands of years before Abraham’s day.\n\nI'm pretty sure 1776 is only inscribed on the base of the pyramid on US currency, not on the actual thing over in Egypt. It sure would be surprising if Ancient Egyptians used Arabic Numerals in their construction projects.\n\n&gt;We find this Great Pyramid on our dollar bill as the Great Seal of the United States. There are 13 levels to the Pyramid, 13 letters in the words Annuit Coeptis (God shall favor thy beginnings), there were 13 tribes of Israel, 13 colonies and 13 states. \n\nThere were 12 tribes of Israel. 12 is actually a super important motif in the Bible because of that. That whole 144,000 number you used earlier? That's there because it's a multiple of 12. Also, he says \"13 colonies and 13 states\" like they're two entirely different things that only number the same out of coincidence. There were 13 of each because the 13 colonies BECAME the 13 states.\n\n&gt;As we look at the Great Seal of the United States, we see the spread wings of the great Eagle which John tells about in the Book of Revelation.\n\n~~Or, OR, it could just be an eagle. Not to mention I've read the Book of Revelation a few times and I don't even remember an eagle.~~\n\nI have been informed there are indeed a few references to eagles in Revelation, not that they can be identified with the US very easily.\n\n&gt;We now take you into the Bible in the Books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus where God tells His people Israel that He will make of that OLD Jerusalem a land of abomination and desolation. He will give them a NEW JerUSAlem.\n\n&gt;JerUSAlem\n\nOh my God. This is the fucking worst etymology ever. Jesus. Yeah, it's totally meaningful that a ten-times translated and transliterated semitic word HAPPENS to contain the letters \"U-S-A\" in that order.\n\n&gt;It will be a land of milk and honey, where the box trees and the fir trees grow. It will lend to all and borrow from none. \n\n&gt;Lend to all and borrow from none.\n\nYeah, because that happened.\n\n&gt;\nHistorical records offer conclusive evidence that George Washington was aware of the Bible prophecy for this nation. He said that he would not accept any Royal Title. We must call him President, because this nation already has a King, it is Jesus Christ.\n\nI'd reeeaaally like to see that in the Constitution. Or in any of his writings.\n\n&gt;All official documents of this government are dated in the year of Our Lord . . . . .and the date is the birth of Jesus Christ\n\nYeah...it's not like every country in the western world does that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;",

        "text": "Ancient Aliens, quite possibly the nadir of bad history. Say what you will about Nazis, they usually stay within a single species hypothesis. The modern version was kicked off by Erich von Daniken's 1968 bestseller *Chariots of the Gods* and so, like the Nazis, this is something we can all blame on the Germans. But the :ancient astronaut” hypothesis has deeper roots, appearing as a staple of science fiction from the birth of the genre and clearly related to the 19th century myths of Atlantis. It is one of the more influential literary tropes of modern fiction and can rightfully be called superb sci-fi. But how will it stand as history? Many mainstream scholars dispute its validity, but Ancient Astronaut Theorists say there may be more to this story.\n\nThe topic of this episode: Stone structures. Across the world you can see structures made out of stone, spanning from southern Turkey to the heights of Peru. From the beginnings of agriculture in 10,000 BCE to after the voyages of Columbus. Some might argue that the geographic and chronological distances make these choices something of a non-sequiter—but what if they were built by aliens? And not the sort of aliens that build things in America today, but rather extra terrestrial aliens. Tonight, we look at these questions through UNEXPLAINED STRUCTURES.\n\nWe begin with [Gobekli Tepe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe#Discovery) First seen in the 1960s by a Turkish-American survey project lead by Halet Cambel, Olympic fencer, snubber of Hitler and all around badass archaeologist, it was written off as a late and possibly Byzantine site. Exploration was later opened by the late Klaus Schmidt. Mainstream scholars note that it existed in an early Neolithic context that includes sites such as the nearby [Nevali Cori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori) and is indicative of the increasing density of the region following the end of the last glacial phase and the Younger Dryas. They may note its monumentality is a fascinating example of early social complexity, predating the development of domesticated agriculture. They may note that this is best explained as a more intense example of the anthropological phenomenon of “complex hunter gatherers” as seen in the [lowlands of Papua New Guinea](www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/338289). But Ancient Astronaut Theorists suggest that it may be something more, something...extra terrestrial.\n\nOne person argues that Gobekli Tepe is “older than the Fertile Crescent”. Mainstream scholars may find this claim puzzling as the Fertile Crescent is a geographic region, and the term was moreover [coined by James Henry Breasted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent#Terminology) to refer to the area in which early agriculture developed, and thus includes Gobekli Tepe. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists argue this may be evidence of an unwritten chapter in human history. Perhaps called 'prehistory” but Ancient Astronaut Theorists are not concerned with that term.\n\nThese Ancient Astronaut Theorists then point to the precision of the carving, which may puzzle mainstream scholars and indeed visitors who may find the graceful beauty of the site captivating but would go through many words before hitting [“precise”](http://www.ibe-travel.com/uploads/Gobekli-Tepe_1334271227.jpg). They also claim that there were no tools found, which would puzzle a particular mainstream scholar who may or may not have considered taking a rather nice piece of flint that was clearly a carving tool and would have put it on his mantlepiece if he were a lawbreaker. This mainstream scholar might also be hypothetically surprised at the surprise of Ancient Astronaut Theorists that wild boar appear as carvings on the pillars, given that he may have had a rather excellent dinner of wild boar courtesy of a somewhat intimidating Turkish man who had shot the boar that morning. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists think it may signify something deeper.\n\nThree hundred miles from Gobekli is Mt. Ararat, the traditional landing of Noah's Arc. Acient Astronaut Theorists propose that this is linked to Gobekli Tepe, as many of the pillars on the Gobekli pillars feature animals, who were also on the Arc. Mainstream researchers respond in dismay that the episode is less than ten minutes in but they have already written a page, and so must regrettably skip this segment.\n\nIn Peru, there are also stone buildings, raising the question: who built them? Mainstream scholars may find the question somewhat baffling, as they were not aware that a single person was ever proposed as the one builder of all stone structures in the world. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists prose that maybe the builder came...from another world.\n\nGraham Hancock is an Ancient Antarctican Theorist and professional chode, and looks at the Inca site of Saqsaywaman, the pronunciation of which was told to a particular mainstream archaeologist as being like “sexy woman” who can now no longer get the association out of his head. Other mainstream archaeologists suggest that the complex was built over an earlier Killke culture site, but Inca myths suggest that the complex was built over the structures of an earlier race, which mainstream archaeologists identify as the Killke, but Ancient Astronaut Theorists suggest may have been *of another world*.\n\nThese theorists point to the extreme precision of Peruvian stone carving. Mainstream scholars might grant a [long standing somewhat fringe position that the Inca used organic acid](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1983.tb00664.x/abstract), and also might more succinctly note that hitting something repeatedly and carefully can produce careful design. These scholars might point to Michelangelo’s David as an example. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists wonder, perhaps this is something else?\n\nThis something else can be found, naturally enough, in France, with the Carnac Stones. Local legend proposes that the stones were Roman soldiers turned to stone by Merlin, but Ancient Astronaut Theorists propose something different, which puzzles certain mainstream scholars who feel the Merlin story is no less plausible than aliens, and is besides quite metal.\n\nThese theorists, heedless of the rather righteous story they leave behind, cite the strange geomagnetic properties of the stone and the Pythagorean property of the ritual complex's alignment. Mainstream scholars note that the Pythagorean property seems to be nothing more than a right angle to a somewhat arbitrary line, and that the insertion of wavy pink lines into post production of the episode doesn't prove the existence of geomagnetic properties. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists think that, perhaps, it does.\n\nWe move now to Armenia. Karahunj, a megalthic site dating to the Neolithic. Certain mainstream archaeologists note that they primarily study Rome and are thus unfamiliar with the site, but question what connection it could have to a flood myth given that Armenia is rather famously on whatever the opposite of a flood plain is. But Ancient Astronaut Theorists suggest...perhaps extraterrestrials.\n\nFlorida, the 1920s. A Latvian immigrant named Edward Leedskalin works in secret to guild the nice is somewhat kitschy neo-megalithic site of Coral Castle. Or was it actually built, and I quote, by “reversing the magnet force [of gravity] with the force of some kind of electro-magnetic, radio, perhaps, frequency” using the technology of aliens?\n\nAnd I don't mean the sort from Latvia.",

        "text": "I've seen Cracked.com make some impressive errors in the name of clickbait, but this is some pretty impressive bad history. In [this article](http://www.donotlink.com/framed?740041) (presented by [DoNotLink](http://donotlink.com) to avoid driving pageviews), Cracked's Adam Tod Brown breaks the story that \"**MLK's Family Sued The Federal Government For Conspiracy To Commit Murder (And Won)**.\" \n\nEven this headline is incorrect, so we're off to a bad start. The article is discussing *King v. Jowers*, a 1999 Memphis case brought by the King family against local nobody Loyd Jowers.  Only Loyd Jowers. The headline suggests that the federal government was somehow a party to this case, and the article doubles down by saying:\n\n**\"Martin Luther King, Jr.'s family not only sued the federal government, but also the man they suspected of being the actual killer ... Loyd Jowers.\"**\n\n[The federal government was not a defendant in this case.](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part6.php) Additionally, Loyd Jowers was not \"suspected of being the actual killer.\" Jowers [boasted about hiring a hitman to kill MLK](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/23/us/loyd-jowers-73-who-claimed-a-role-in-the-killing-of-dr-king.html) but was not suspected of being the triggerman.\n\nThe article draws an absurd parallel to the OJ Simpson case.\n\n**\"Granted, this happened in civil court, where the burden is lower, making it far easier to get the verdict you're after. Still, sometimes that's what it takes. If you're skeptical about this actually casting any guilt on the government, I'd ask you this: Do you feel the same way about OJ?\"**\n\nThe OJ civil trial managed to make a more complete showing of evidence than the criminal trial, whereas the *King v. Jowers* trial was a complete farce. From the Justice Department report:\n\n*The parties did not introduce Jowers' many inconsistent claims, the inconsistent statements of several critical witnesses, or information that contradicted and undermined the trial evidence...Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation. Additionally, none of these allegations were ever linked together. Rather, the hearsay evidence alleged that various government agencies participated in assorted assassination plots that are actually contradictory.*\n \nThe clown-college nature of the trial should address the author's concern, that **\"...even while the trial was happening, almost no news outlets covered it.\"** But hey, a reasonable response to the facts doesn't drive clicks. And I'm almost certain the author knew about these facts; these are all from the first page of Google results, and I would be shocked if the Cracked research team went past that. Even so, with these omissions and misstatements fresh in our mind, we end the entry with\n\n**'This is one of those rare instances where \"the government doesn't want you to know\" actually seems like the most plausible explanation.'**",

So, this one will stick mostly to the film. Whenever I get to the 2004 version, I'll try to give a little more background. \n\nIf I have made meta-badhistory and there's something wrong with the post, \n\nCome and Take It, as I'm by no means an expert.\n\nOk, so credits and trumpet solo.\n&gt;In the year of our Lord 1836, Texas, which has known many flags, was then under the colours of Mexico. Though its inhabitants were made up of settlers from far countries and all parts of the United States, they were Mexican citizens all.\n\n&gt;Generalissimo Santa Anna was sweeping north across Mexico toward the crushing all who opposed his tyrannical rule. They now faced the decision that men in all times must face...the eternal choice of men...to endure oppression or to resist.\n\nHere we see late 1950s Cold War era John Wayne making the first of his allusions to freedom, principled uncompromising resistance to tyranny, etc. This introduction presents the Texas Revolution the way it is often presented here: Santa Anna takes power in Mexico as an authoritarian dictator, which incites Texas to rebel, and eventually declare independence, because they love freedom, and so forth. \n\nHe said in an interview about the film, \n\n&gt;It was not a story that belongs only to Texas. It belongs to people everywhere who have an interest in a thing called freedom. I think we are in danger, and have been for a long time, of going soft, of taking things for granted; neglecting to have an objective about things for which we stand and forgetting the things that made this a great nation. \n\nAnglo settlement in Texas began in earnest in the mid 1820s with the arrival of Stephen F Austin's colonists along the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers. Within ten years, about 20 empresarios had settled about 30,00 Anglos on the Gulf Coastal Plain between Corpus Christi Bay and Nacogdoches. Around the old Spanish settlements of Nacogdoches, Goliad and San Antonio, and around Martin De Leon's new settlement of Victoria, there were 5-7000 Tejanos. \n\nThere had been tensions between the settlers and the Mexican government from the start over land ownership, trade and tariffs, being attached to Coahuila, and as quite a few people wilfully ignore, slaves, of which there were about 5000, by 1835. Ango immigration and slavery had been outlawed in 1830. Both laws were routinely disregarded. Immigration had been restored in 1833, but nevertheless there had been plenty of illegal immigration from the United States into Mexico. The Conventions of 1832 and 1833, and the armed conflicts in [Anahuac](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jca01), [Velasco](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfv01) and Nacogdoches in 1832 marked the way down the uneven and winding road toward open rebellion. Most of the soldiers killed at Goliad and the Alamo arrived in Texas after the open rebellion had started. Neither they nor Mexico would have likely considered them Mexican citizens.\n\nIt's really hard to tell when exactly the film starts, because of the copious anachronisms, but its reasonable to say sometime in  early/mid February 1836. \n\nSo here we see Sam Houston arriving in San Antonio followed by a few dozen riders. This presents somewhat of a problem as there was no point in the War of Independence when the Raven was anywhere near San Antonio or, ergo, the Alamo. Much of this film is ahistorical, but the following scene is one of two or three which are the worst offenders. Nothing even resembling what is depicted in the next ten or so minutes ever happened. \n\nHouston getting annoyed, \"Mr Dickinson I asked you a question. WHERE'S JIM BOWIE?\"\n\"He's in dispose, sir.\" blah blah blah \"James Butler Bonham, under Travis's command, sir.\"\nSo Sam Houston knows who Almaron Dickinson is, but not James Bonham? Unlikely. Bonham and Houston had first become introduced in December 1835, when Bonham wrote, volunteering to fight for Texas. Houston had recommended he be promoted to major in January. He knew damn good and well who James Bonham was.\n\n&gt;Neill, you go north with me. \n\nIn this scene we are given our first glimpse of [James C Neill](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fne11),  who is given a pitifully small part is this movie. He had been in command of the Alamo garrison since December 21, a few days after the town and mission were captured by the Texian rebel army from Cos in the Siege of Bexar. Neill had kept his command together in the intervening two and a half months and managed to maintain some semblance of morale and discipline despite the bickering and incompetent clusterfuck of a  government created by the [Consultation](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mjc08) in late 1835. There was no unified command to request funding or supplies from, even if those things had existed in any quantity in winter 1836 in Texas.\n\nNeill left on Feb 11 to take care of his ill family and gather recruits and supplies for the Army. He returned for a few days on Fen 14, but left before Santa Anna arrived and the siege began.\n&gt;I've been given command of the armies of Texas.\n\nWhoa, slow down there Sam. You've been given command of the *Regular* Army, which exists mostly on paper. At this point, there was no such thing as the \"Texas Army.\" The militias were frighteningly independent bodies who only tolerated their own elected officers. They generally ignored orders from any higher authority, whether it be Houston, Governors Smith or Robinson. Many of them had disbanded after the Siege of Bexar anyway. \n\nAnd here's where we get to the whole premise of the film. Sam Houston needs time to organize and train an actual non-paper army large and disciplined enough to fight and defeat Santa Anna, so Travis will have to keep him occupied at the Alamo as long as possible. This is actually almost literally the opposite of Houston's intentions. Besides not taking the field as a commander until March 11 and spending most of the siege going to or participating in, the Convention of 1836 that declared independence, Houston wasn't really interested in having men at the Alamo in the first place. He had sent a personal friend to San Antonio with instructions to appraise the situation and advised simply removing the artillery and ordered the burning of the mission and town. He wrote to Governor Henry Smith saying \"ordered the fortifications in the town of Bexar to be demolished, and if you should think well of it, I will remove all the cannon and other munitions of war to Gonzales and Copano, blow up the Alamo, and abandon the place, as it will be impossible to keep up the Station with volunteers..\" Bonham and a few others had probably arrived with him around Jan 18 or 19. Neill convinced them of the value of holding the Alamo and continuing its fortification begun by General Cos's original Mexican garrison. They stated in a letter to Henry Smith that they would \"rather die in these trenches than give them up to the enemy.\" Smith didn't really want to abandon San Antonio, but Houston had no desire to fight there. I'll get to more on Houston and abandoning the fort a little further down the line.\n\nI have to interject something in here that might be sort of obvious, but I'll say it anyway. William Barrett Travis wasn't British. Granted, neither was Laurence  Harvey, technically, but still. He makes kind of an effort here to sound Southern for a minute or two, and then forgets for the rest of the film and lapses back into the Queen's good English.\n\n&gt;You people right here on the Rio Grande are going to have to buy me that time.\n\nUh. /r/badgeography \nSan Antonio is nowhere near the Rio Grande, unless \"on\" means somewhere within 130 miles. San Antonio is on the Rio Grande in much the same way that Columbus, Ohio is in Michigan. The river that San Antonio was built on is...surprise...the San Antonio. \n\"He took this town from General Cos. He fought a battle.\" \nThe second part is certainly correct. Jim Bowie and James Fannin commanded the Texians at the Battle of Concepcion on Oct 28 and participated in the Siege of Bexar. He did not, however, capture San Antonio from Martin Perfecto de Cos. The final assault happened after Bowie had left and he was not present for the surrender.\n&gt;He's married into the Mexican aristocracy. \n\nJim Bowie married Ursula Veramendi in 1831 in San Antonio. She was indeed from a wealthy family and her father was Vice-Governor of Coahuila, which at that point included Texas. There will be more on this later.\n&gt;Jethro is that you.\n\nBowie's slave's name was Sam, not Jethro. (Reportedly, he was actually a \"servant\" of Bowie's wife's family.) Jethro is the only slave depicted in the film and his treatment is not exactly what you'd expect from a Southern plantation economy, which is certainly what East and East-Central Texas were turning into, and the environment from which the majority of its Anglo residents immigrated. Slavery was just as present and just as brutal as anywhere else in the American South. \n\n&gt;Lieutenant Blake, you will see to the quartering of Bowie's volunteers.\n\nI can't find a record of a 'Blake' at the Alamo, much less one with the rank of Lieutenant. Also, Bowie had been there for a few weeks, and most of the volunteers had participated in the siege and had thus  been there even longer. Bowie didn't bring many of them in. He was in charge because they elected him to command.\n\nSo now we see Bowie himself, who has gone from drunk to just hungover. Where are the chops? This is a thing throughout the movie. If you could have facial hair like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bowie#/media/File:Jimbowie.jpg), would you?\n\nSo would I.\n\n&gt;Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men...You ain't gonna try and defend this broken church against 7000 battle hardened troops.\n\nSanta Anna's Army of Operations reportedly contained 6,019 soldiers when it began marching north in December 1835. Around a thousand were diverted under the command of Jose de Urrea in the Goliad Campaign along the Texas coast and did not participate in the siege. There were nowhere near 7000 Mexican soldiers at the Alamo.\n\nHere's where [Juan Seguin](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse08) shows up with intelligence about Santa Anna. He's too old. That looks more like [Erasmo Seguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmo_Segu%C3%ADn), his father. Juan was 30 years old in 1836. Also he didn't have a mustache. \n\nIts also a bit weird that residents of Seguin's property would be talking about Mexican troops coming from Mexico. The Seguin ranch was located around present day Floresville, which is a half hour southeast on US 181, or kind of in the wrong direction.\n&gt;Alcalde of San Antonio de Bexar...civillians.\n\nSeguin hadn't  been the alcalde since 1834 and wouldn't be again until 1841, well into the Republic. The alcalde in February 1836 was Francisco Antonio Ruiz, who while a also Federalist and no friend of Santa Anna, was most certainly not Juan Seguin.\n\nSeguin had been scouting for Texian forces for several months and had commanded a Tejano militia several times immediately before and during the Revolution. He was commissioned as a captain the regular army of Texas in January and was sent out as a courier by Travis as early as two days after the siege began. Seguin was in no sense a civilian. There were indeed rumors and reports that Santa Anna was near the  Rio Grande and was fairly close to San Antonio, and they were indeed ignored. However, for the most part, this scene is ahistorical. Travis said he thought the rumors were exaggerated because the thought so, not because he thought he might frighten his men.\n\nHere we see Travis going up a flight of steps to his office in the second story of the part of the Convento nearest the church. [For reference](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/maps/alamo-map-3.gif) Upstairs is where the hospital was. The actual garrison headquarters was directly across the yard from there, on ground level. Wayne selected the upstairs room as the office so that the camera is predominantly looking up at Travis when he's talking to other cast members, reinforcing the fact that he's portrayed as an arrogant, snobby elitist.\n\n&gt;I'd say we  have two, or at best three days before we see his banners.\n\nEh, you think you have a few weeks or a month. You were expecting Santa Anna around mid March.\n\nHere we get our first glimpse of John Wayne as David Crockett, who did not often refer to himself as 'Davy' or use the title Colonel.\n\nHe tells his men \"it ain't no fort. Its an old mission.\"\nIt's both. It is obviously now a fort, but it had been garrisoned by Texian, Mexican and Spanish soldiers on and off since secularization of the mission around the turn of the 19th century. Here is also the start of Crockett misrepresenting and misleading his men into fighting, which was not really the case.\n\nEveryone keeps using the word \"Texican.\" Unless you are Audie Murphy, you are not a Texican. Anglo residents of Mexican Texas were 'Texian'. \nOkay so Travis is talking to Crockett now, officially, as the commander of the garrison. \n\nQuibble. Crockett arrived in San Antonio on February 6, when James Neill was still very much present and in command.\n&gt;Old drunken General Flatford gave it (the title of colonel) to me in the Choctaw Indian War.\n\nI have no idea who this General Flatford is. Crockett was involved in fighting the Creeks in late 1813, not the Choctaws. During this time he was a scout and hunter, providing meat to his militia regiment. His election to command of a militia unit and title of colonel came later, in 1819. \n\n&gt;They heard many a speech while I was congressifyin'.\n\nThey probably did, but not as your entourage. You recruited most of these men in Tennessee shortly before you left. They aren't your lifelong friends.\n\n&gt;Of the many and unendurable hardships the people have been subjected to, under the tyrannical government of this military dictator Santa Anna. We have no rights in the courts, no market for our produce. He has forbidden trade with the North.\n\nHere Travis is waxing eloquent to Crockett about the justification for the Revolution. The speech really doesn't sound that far off from Travis's or a lot of other Texian's opinions about the Centralist Mexican government and how it was literally 1984.\n\nCrockett pulls out a few cigars and says be brought 'em all the way from New Orleans. I'll defer to /u/buy_a_pork_bun on this, but I will say that Crockett traveled to Texas from Tennessee via Memphis, Arkansas and East Texas, not Louisiana and had spent most of that time in the wilderness and away from your typical cigar vendor and those cigars have probably never seen a humidor. So, he hadn't been in New Orleans in a good while and he could probably get better cigars.\n\n&gt;Declare this the Republic of Texas?\n\n&gt;I hadn't thought this was generally known.\n\nNo, it hadn't been officially stated, but no one in Texas after the elections to the 1836 Convention really thought the war was about the Constitution of 1824 or federalism anymore. After early Feburary, it was quietly, but fairly confidently known that secession would come sooner or later. Travis certainly believed so. He wrote on March 3, \"Let the Convention go on and make a declaration of independence, and we will then understand, and the world will understand, what we are fighting for. If independence is not declared, I shall lay down my arms, and so will the men under my command.\"\n\nOk, so now Crockett gives his \"Republic. I like the sound of the word\" speech.\n\n&gt;Go or come, buy or sell...\" \n\nLol, what? You mean people?\n\nTravis tells Crockett he believes he came to Texas to fight. I should hope so. He stated several times that's why he led his band there. The portrayal of Crockett tricking his unknowing men into fighting in completely fictional.\n\nBowie, on Mexicans. \"They got courage, and they got dignity. They ain’t afraid to die. But what seems most important to me is that they ain’t afraid to live. Today is important to them, not the dollar tomorrow might bring. I suppose the Yankees say that’s lazy. Me, I say it’s a way of livin’.\"\n\nIt sounds like Bowie read Max Weber and *hated* it.\n\n[The portrayal of Hispanics in this film, while far from ideal, (All of them but Seguin and Graciela are background characters, and there is no significant speaking part in the Mexican Army. Like much of the rest of the film, there's more wrong with that it didn't portray that what it did.) is not even in the same league as most earlier films. The fact that they are portrayed as people with motivations and independent agency is a massive step up from the past. The Alamo, as a film subject has a long, and sordid tradition of portraying any Spanish speaker as being on the screen for the sole purpose of robbing some innocent white woman of her honor. A popular Alamo film from 1915 was titled the Martyrs of the Alamo, brought to you by D W Griffith. Yes *that* D W Griffith.The Last Command and this version of the Alamo, were the first films about the battle to remove the theme of the noble white men heroically battling the brown mongrel, savages horde and to focus on something other than how awesome white people were compared to every other people and how every Mexican soldier was a crazed war criminal.](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth117151/m1/61/)\n\nAh, here's one of the kickers. \"I, uh sent them up to Coahuila with all the trouble we've had.\"\n\nWhat Houston said earlier about Bowie's marriage was technically true. Just as what Bowie himself just said was technically true. Bowie did marry into the Veramendis and did send his wife and two children to Coahuila with all the trouble they've had. Except he sent them there in 1833 and the \"trouble\" was a cholera epidemic. The disease appeared in Monclova, too and killed his wife, children and her parents. Bowie himself was bedridden with yellow fever in Natchez, Mississippi at that time. The loss of his family is what is reported to have started him on his drinking. It is also generally seen as starting down the road to rebelling.\n\nGraciela tells the Duke that her would be suitor has stashed a bunch of rifles and powder in the basement of the church, which the rebels desperately need. \nCrockett and Bowie naturally investigate and find said weaponry. Firstly, no there wren't any armaments hidden under what is now San Fernando Cathedral. Secondly, the church has about as much of a basement as the Alamo. So, no Pee Wee, your bike's not there either. Last, the church is built of stone. I see bricks. Why are there bricks in my non existent church basement? \n\nUgh, Phillistines.\n\nSince /u/Quouar is moratorium'd, I'll have to fill in for her.\nAh, so here we see the Mexican Army of Operations racing toward destiny...in beautiful autumn weather, which it shouldn't be. The crew started filming in Sept 1959. The entire film takes place in Feburary and early march. As some may have noticed, fall weather is typically a bit different than weather in late winter and early spring. The gloomy, cloudy weather when Houston rides up is just about perfect. The bright, clear weather given to the Mexican Army is innacurate for most of their march. They ran into a blizzard in Coahuila, which killed pack animals and even a few soldiers and camp followers. Many of them, from lowland southern and central Mexico had never seen snow and were quite unused to the cold. Granted, the weather in Texas, itself, on the march wasn't cold, but it wasn't exactly bright and sunny. Hoping to dash the last twenty or so miles into San Antonio and take the hungover defenders by surprise after a rumored fiesta, Mexican cavalry instead encountered torrential rains and a swollen Medina River. \n\nSo it goes.\n\nI'll take this opportunity to say I love this music. Like, this is Dimitri Tomkin's best score. Yes I mean better than High Noon or the Guns of Navarrone. Come at me bro.\n\nHere, at 55:15 the camera pans from the town across to the mission and you can see one from the point of view of the other . Now I'm getting annoyed. This is atrocious. The Alamo church faces west, with the majority of the mission lying on the north side of it and the Galera, containing the gate, on the south side. [The Alamo Village](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.4263103,-100.3954049,599m/data=!3m1!1e3) has it rotated 180 degrees. The church faces east with the Galera on the north side and Convento on the south side. Secondly, the town is much too close. San Fernando Cathedral, which faces east, not northeast, is about a half mile from the Alamo. The filming site has them spaced less than a quarter mile apart, and in the wrong direction. The Alamo is due east of the Cathedral, which is its  pre cathedral, 18th and 19th century days, was the center of town. The Alamo is not south-southeast of the core of San Antonio as is depicted. The church is depicted incorrectly. Before the neogothic expansion in the 1870s, San Fernando church was a cruciform shaped building with a dome over the center of the cross, which is missing, and a bell tower on the left side of the door, if facing the building. Instead it is shown as a rectangular building with a bell tower halfway down the length of what I'm presuming is the nave. The town itself is aligned incorrectly, both absolutely and with respect to the Alamo. There should be two large plazas, one each on the east and west side of the church, with houses, businesses, gardens and farms surrounding them, not brush and unoccupied prairie. The town being for the most part was aligned east to west, roughly along present day Commerce and Dolorosa/Market streets, between the [Governor's Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Governor%27s_Palace) on the west end of Plaza de Armas, and the eastern end of the Potrero roughly on Navarro Street. Instead we have the church of the southwestern edge of town aligned along two crooked streets, running roughly northeast to southwest. There are two open areas on the wrong side of the church that could be construed as plazas. They are much too small, however, as is the town in general. \n\nAnd most importantly...WHERE THE HELL IS THE RIVER? There should be a tree-lined river within three or four hundred feet of the mission. A river, which I'm guessing is the upper Nueces, is seen here and there, but never from the town or mission, from both of which, it should be visible alot.\n\nI know no set is perfect, but this is just lazy. Brackettville is too dry, to sparse, and with too much topography too close to the set to accurately portray San Antonio.\n\nOkay rant over. Here we have Travis introducing Susanna Dickinson as his cousin, which is not true at all. I seem to have bought the version of without the theatrical cuts included, which state her daughter's name is Lisa. Anway, Its not. It's Angelina. \nFannin \"has mustered almost a thousand men at Goliad.\" They then talk about how its too good to be true and go on further about keeping bad news from the men. Fannin had around 400 men under his command at La Bahia. I can't find any claims from him that he had raised anywhere near a thousand soldiers.\n\nBowie: \"I got a reputation for truth, Travis.\" Could have fooled me. Yes, how can anyone forget the truth of the Las Almagres Mine, your totally honest land dealings or how you made your original fortune by slave smuggling. Real straight shooter there.\n\n\"What we should do is burn all of Bexar, including this Mission.\" Remember that guy that Houston sent to burn down Bexar, including this mission, whom Neill persuaded not to? That was Bowie. He keeps threatening to leave throughout the whole movie and how its stupid and suicidal to stay. He may have thought negotiations were possible with the Mexicans or that an honorable peace could be achieved, but he was most certainly not inclined to leave the mission and \"cut, slash, and run.\" I don't really have any problem with the portrayal of Bowie as drunk or abrasive, but constantly agitating to leave the mission and wanting to burn it is completely incorrect. \n&gt;I'm in command and I've already decided against your plan. \n\nWell, that's kinda true. Neill left Travis in command after he departed, but the militia were disinclined to take orders from anyone they didn't elect, and thus preferred Bowie. Travis and Bowie agreed to share command after a drinking binge which embarrassed Bowie and apparently somewhat humbled him. \n\nCrockett talking to Seguin notices that people are \"running like sheep that have smelled a wolfpack.\" He clearly means busy and industrious, unless I'm wrong. However, on a certain level, the movement he sees happened. There were quite a few Tejanos leaving San Antonio in the few weeks before Santa Anna arrived. They didn't like the rumors and decided to get out of Dodge before they became facts. They'd already been through one battle in fall and didn't care for another in spring.\n\nHere arrives the Mexican Army in San Antonio, in bright, sunny, not very historical weather. A messenger rides  up under a white flag and reads Travis an ultimatum. \n\n&gt;From the headquarters of Generalìssimo Antonio López de Santa Anna, absolute ruler of Mexico, to the rebel commander who deems himself in command of the rebels occupying the mission. Be it known : the province of Mexico known as Texas has shown itself to be in active and treasonous revolt against the rule of Generalìssimo Santa Anna. The Generalìssimo in his kindness, issues the following order : All occupants of the mission will leave at once, leaving all arms and ammunition behind them. If this order is not followed with your dispatch, the Generalìssimo will be reducing the mission by assault. There will be no quarter given. Signed Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.\"\n\n BOOM.\n\nThe courier actually rode while a bugler sounded a request for parley. Travis ordered the eighteen pounder fired, as depicted. A messenger sent by Bowie received the following reply:\n\n&gt;The Mexican Army cannot come to terms under any conditions with rebellious foreigners to whom there is no other recourse left, if they wish to save their lives, than to place themselves immediately at the disposal of the Supreme Government from whom alone they may expect clemency after some considerations are taken up.\n\nLater Travis and Dickinson are watching the army pour into San Antonio. Dickinson comments the troops he's observing add up to 2000 strong. There were about 1500 by the end of February 23.\n&gt;That main body must be strung out from miles : the assault infantry, heavy artillery, commissary and supply trains… They won’t be here for four or five days, and the actual battle can’t start until then. Oh, there’ll be an occasional sortie or artillery fire, feeling out our defenses. They won’t commit themselves to an actual attack until Santa Anna is here with his main force.\n\nI'll go in order. The heavy artillery won't be here for two weeks, i.e. until after the battle is over. Here, in the early part of the siege, the Alamo defenders actually have an advantage in artillery over the Mexicans, who have about ten fieldpieces. There were nineteen or twenty mounted inside the mission. The one advantage Santa Anna did have was in ammunition, which he used to great effect. Travis himself said in his message to the People of Texas &amp; all Americans in the world, written February 24, that they had kept up a constant 24 hour bombardment of the Alamo since they arrived, a little more than \"occasional artillery fire.\" Travis originally ordered each shot answered, but within a few days began conserving his powder and shot. Lastly, Santa Annis *is* here. \n\nA (fictional) scout named Finn returns from a patrol describing a twelve or fourteen foot cannon. A Tennessean yells: \"Hey Travis ! With a cannon like that, them Santa Anna fellas can just sit up there and give us what for, can’t they ?\"\n\nWell, yes, that's the point. The particular cannon isn't something the Mexican force would have actually had, but he describes exactly what the Army intended to do. Keep up a constant firing against the walls until they were destroyed at which point the fort would be worthless. [Earthworks](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bbl17) grew closer to the mission every night to get the artillery progressively closer. Many Mexican officers complained later that Santa Anna's impatience and arrogance needlessly wasted the lives of several hundred soldiers with the assault.\n\nSince the cannon was fictional, the raid out to spike it is also obviously quite fictional.\nOne thing the film *doesn't* portray is a sortie out by a few dozen Texians to burn a few jacales (small thatch and mud houses) just south the mission, surrounding Alamo Plaza. For context, this is somewhere between the modern Alamo grounds and La Villita. A few Mexican soldiers had occupied the houses and looked to be in the process of preparing an artillery battery behind them. \n\nWhen Bowie gets back from the raid, he and Travis are pissed off at each other as they perpetually are in this film. By this point Bowie, should have collapsed and be laying in a bed. He was not injured as is depicted. He suffered some sort of respiratory illness, probably exacerbated by drinking heavily. Travis condescendingly tells Crockett why they are fighting. He draws a line in the sand with his sword marking it as the Sabine River and puts Houston on the opposite side of it from the Alamo. More /r/badgeography. I mean, yes, the soldiers were mostly American, but they weren't *literally* in Louisiana. As a matter of fact, Houston, at this point was probably riding from his negotiations with the Cherokee in northeast  Texas to the Convention in Washington-on-the-Brazos to debate and eventually sign the Declaration of Independence. He was not in any sense \"organizing an army.\"\n\nSo the next night, a messenger throws a sombrero over the wall with a letter telling Bowie his wife is dead. He's a few years too late. Jim must have been hitting the bourbon extra hard that night, because he just can't seem to realize [SHE'S  DEAD JIM.](http://orig13.deviantart.net/8060/f/2013/232/8/3/trek_069_by_dave_daring-d6ixqw1.jpg)\n\nHere is where the garrison launches the huge cattle rustling operation and steals a bunch of longhorns from the Mexican herd. The first thing is wtf are you doing wading chest high in that river in february. Are you nuts? And no there was no huge cattle drive through the middle of San Antonio. The Texians had a few cattle they kept in the square behind the Convento back and to the north of the church, but not like, a hundred. Also for having been surprised by not expecting the Mexican Army and having no time to gather fodder for a week, those horses sure look healthy.\n\nOne of the views is from the front of the church to its right, between it and the Galera, which houses the gate. The short palisade should have an abatis of felled, spiked and chiseled trees in front of it to deter cavalry. There should also be a U shaped earthwork in front of the gate housing a few cannons.\n\nAh, here we have Bowie announcing the Big He-Bull himself arriving. We see a distinguished looking officer on horseback. Santa Anna arrived at the Alamo on the first day. (also he didn't have a mustache) About 1000 Mexican reinforcements did arrive about March 3, which many Texians thought to be led by Santa Anna and that General [Sesma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Ram%C3%ADrez_y_Sesma) had been commanding the siege so far. They were mistaken. Santa Anna had been in San Antonio since the siege began, with Sesma commanding the cavalry.\n\nIn one of the views from the mission toward town we can see what is supposed to be San Fernando church. It should be flying a red flag and isn't.\n\nSanta Anna had already arrived and had been bombarding the missing for ten days. The families leaving the Alamo scene is fictional along with the Generalissimo arriving. Just about every civilian in the mission on Feb 23, was there on March 6.\n\nOk so here's a dude named Jocko Robertson with a blind wife named Nell, both of whom are from Tennessee. There was a James Robertson, from Tennessee, at the Alamo. He was 24 in 1836, not in his forties or fifties like this version is. \n\nSanta Anna seems to order an attack on the Alamo almost immediately after the civlians are evacuated, in daytime. There was no assault intended to storm the mission until the final attack three days later. The Mexican siege consisted of constant artillery fire and attacks on any Texians who ventured beyond the walls. \n\nDuring the fictional assault, Bowie is injured when a cannon shot collapses the catwalk he's standing on, injuring his leg. Bowie was bedridden in a room in the convento, as he has been since the second day, and as he would be until he died.\n\nWhat there should have been in the movie is the arrival of 32 men from Gonzales in the early morning of March 1. Before this point, the defenders numbered about 150\nJames Bonham arrives back at the Alamo saying that Fannin isn't coming. This is completely true. Apparently Fannin's force had been ambushed and murdered. This is completely untrue. \n\nFannin had left Presido La Bahia on February 28 to reinforce the Alamo, but had turned back after a traveling about a mile, citing lack of supplies and hearing that Urrea was approaching from the south. He sent Travis a message saying as much. He left again on March 19, this time to join Houston's army along the Colorado River. Urrea's troops caught him in the middle of a prairie, with cover several miles away in each direction. Fannin held off the Mexican attack until the next day, when he surrendered and was led back with his men to Goliad. On March 27 Santa Anna ordered them executed over Urrea's objections. So yes, Fannin's men were murdered. However, the Goliad Massacre was 21 days after the Alamo fell and James Bonham was dead.\n\nIn response to Bonham's message, Bowie and Crockett agree to evacuate their men. They assemble, mounted, in the yard where Travis speaks to them and orders the gate opened. This is in daylight. Bowie, especially, would not have done anything this idiotic. He had seen the helplessness of militia on the open prairie against Mexican cavalry, which was far superior to anything Texians could put on foot or on horseback. Texian victories relied on thick cover or surprise to neutralize cavalry and limit the fighting to infantry engagements, which the Texians were more adept at. \n\nSo Smith reaches Houston's camp, which didn't historically exist until a week later, and also apparently in a single day, which is pretty impressive for San Antonio to the Sabine River. He turns around immediately after delivering the message and rides back toward San Antonio. I feel sorry for that horse.\nOn the morning of March 6, we see the sun rising, and the defenders waiting on the walls for the attack. Drummers are playing a cadence, buglers are playing an ominous tune. A shitton of cannons open up on the walls and the infantry advance. All of this is in well into the morning, with a nice bright sky.\n\nThe innacuracies here are the presence of several things that were nowhere to be found in the Mexican assault, namely: drums, bugles, artillery, awake and alert defenders, and lastly, the sun. The preparations began at midnight, March 6. Santa Anna had been growing impatient and wanted a quick end to the battle. The night before, a Hispanic woman reported to some Mexican officers that the garrison was willing to surrender. The woman was, according to Susanna Dickinson, [Juana Navarro Alsbury](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal49), \na cousin of Bowie's late wife. She was reportedly sent by Travis as a feeler to seek out an honorable surrender. She got essentially the same answer that Travis and Bowie had gotten at the beginning of the siege. \n\nSanta Anna apparently wasn't interested in a surrender. He was interested in absolute victor to avenge the slight to his family and to the Mexican Army. Lt Col [Jose Enrique de la Peña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Enrique_de_la_Pe%C3%B1a) speculated that Santa Anna \"would have regretted taking the Alamo without clamor and without bloodshed for some believe without these there is no glory.\" Granted, de la Peña intensely disliked Santa Anna, but also granted, at one time or another, most of Mexico did as well. At a council of war on the evening of March 5, Santa Anna, his aide de camp, [Juan Almonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Almonte), and Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma were in favor of an assault early the following morning. Most of the rest of the officers preferred to wait until the heavy artillery arrived in two or three days to simply reduce the mission. Santa Anna ordered  attack for the next morning, which began at 5a.m., well before the sun came up.\n\nThe Mexican infantry start advancing and a bunch of cavalry jump the low barricade in front of the church. Santa Anna had ordered the cavalry to patrol around the mission to stop any Texian escapees. The low wall had abatis in front of it to stop cavalry anyway. The first breakthrough came at the north wall, as depicted, although having been battered for 12 days, it was a bit more shoddy than shown in the film. Mexicans infantry storm the main plaza and the Texians form a barricade in front of the church. They actually would have retreated to the convento and to the church itself. Crockett most certainly did not bow up the powder in the church. A Texian was indeed trusted with doing so, but he was killed before his torch reached its target, which is a good thing for Susanna and Angelina Dickinson and Joe, who were hiding in the sacristy adjacent to the building. \n\nOk, so the battle is now over and Susanna and Angelina are discovered by a Mexican officer, who leads them out of the mission to a mule and they walk away past an [incorrectly mustached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna#/media/File:Santaanna1.JPG) Santa Anna toward Smitty, who has just arrived back from Houston's camp.  There were atually about a dozen survivors. Alsbury and her sister, Sam, Joe, and the wife and children of Gregorio Esparza, a Tejano soldier. One Mexican Army deserter, who had served under Cos convinced the newly arrived Mexicans he was a Texian prisoner by locking himself in the jail. Santa Anna interviewed each of the civilian survivors. He offered to adopt Angelina and have here given an aristocratic education in Mexico City, which Susanna declined. He sent them on their way with a few pesos to the east to tell the Anglo settlements what she saw and scare the shit out the inhabitants. It worked [reasonably well.](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pfr01)\n\nHaha! 39676 characters.

        "text": "With the month of genocide denial moratorium over, I can finally post about this. And with the 20th anniversary of Srebrenica just coming up, it seems particularly suitable.\n\nEdward Herman, as you may know, is most well known for co-authoring Manufacturing Consent with Noam Chomsky. Somewhat less known is that he also denies both the Rwandan Genocide and Srebrenica Massacre happened.\n\nI may do a post on Rwanda at some point, but for now I want to focus on and refute [this article](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/herman200710.html) from 2010, written for the 15th Anniversary of Srebrenica. While it's mostly about the Fall of Yugoslavia, it also contains a lot of general polemicising by Herman to make his argument look thicker in terms of substance than it actually is: I'll pick this up if it's relevant, but if it's not or I just don't know enough about the topic, I'll leave it.\n\n&gt; The regular annual focus of attention on this particular tragedy and violence calls for an explanation. After all, there is no such annual memorial in the West as regards the Sabra-Shatila killings of several thousand Palestinians on September 16-18, 1982, although these were killings of civilians, whereas the Bosnian Muslims killed at Srebrenica were almost exclusively military-aged men, mostly soldiers.\n\nSo apparently military-aged men cannot possibly be civilians? Anyone male between about 14 and 60 is fair game in war? Also, the VRS (Bosnian Serb Army) didn't make much of an effort to keep to this 'military age' standard; it's hard to get a certain age from exhumations, but several bodies could be identified as being 12 or 13 at the oldest. It's possible some could have been as young as 8. The other end is harder to tell, but range of estimates makes it very possible that some were in their seventies or eighties. Also, analysis of the bodies found the mass grave at Kozluk showed some of the victims to be amputees, who I think we can safely assume were probably not capable of being soldiers regardless of age.\n\nAlso, there's a more basic problem of numbers with such a claim. There were only around 6,000 ARBiH (Bosnian Army) soldiers in Srebrenica (though many of these were soldiers in name only, not having any training, weapons, or even uniforms in some cases). More than 3,000 of them survived the attempt to break through to Tuzla. Therefore, the number of soldiers killed in the massacre was still less than 3,000 at the most, making them necessarily a minority of the ~8,000 victims.\n\n&gt; Also, just one month after the Srebrenica massacre the Croatian military invaded the Krajina area, killing several thousand, including several hundred women and children, and turned some 250,000 Serbs into refugees, the largest case of ethnic cleansing in the Balkan wars.\n\nI'll start with the slightly more defensible figure - most estimates put the number of Serbs made refugees by Operation Storm at 150,000-200,000. 250,000 is a very high estimate, though close enough that I can't say for certain it's wrong, but it's still an example of Herman's abuse and bait-and-switch of figures.\n\nPutting the number killed at \"several thousand\", by contrast, is nonsense. [Even Serbian state TV](http://web.archive.org/web/20131130132332/http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%25C5%25A1tvo/1213328/Molitva+za+%25C5%25BErtve+i+ubijenu+pravdu.html) put the number of Serb civilians killed in Storm at 1,192. ICTY put it at just 324.\n\nHe also neglects to mention that a similar number of non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed from the same area in 1991-93, which, while not justifying Storm, is a pretty important piece of context.\n\n&gt; A European Parliament resolution of January 15, 2009, which institutionalized an annual \"day of commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide,\" mentions the \"deportations of thousands of women, children and elderly people\" from Srebrenica, but nowhere does it officially condemn or call for the memorialization of the deportation of 250,000 Serbs from the Krajina.\n\nHe's playing bait and switch with the statistics here, portraying the number of refugees as the number deported, which of course is not the same thing. [The ICTY judgement for leading Croatian generals involved in Storm](http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/tjug/en/110415_summary.pdf) puts the number of those actually deported (as opposed to fleeing out of fear of the fighting, or because the RSK told them to leave) at simply \"more than 20,000\".\n\n&gt; Admittedly, 8,000 is a large number. But 250,000 Serb refugees is a larger number.\n\nYes, but 8,000 isn't a number of refugees, it's a number of *deaths*. And not just any deaths, but systematic killings. Really not the same thing.\n\n&gt; Apart from its selectivity, there is also a question of the accuracy of that large number, 8,000.  There has been a steady stream of inflated, sometimes ludicrously inflated, claims of target-inflicted deaths in the Yugoslav wars.  From 1993 onward the implausible and unverified Bosnian Muslim claim of 200-300,000 victims was uncritically accepted and institutionalized in the Western mainstream media.  It was undermined in 2003-2007 by a pair of studies sponsored by the ICTY itself and the Norwegian government, both of which found total deaths on all sides, including soldiers, to be on the order of 100,000.\n\nThe higher figures were being pushed by UN figures like Cherif Bassiouni more so than by the Bosnian Muslim government. In fact, by near the end of the war, Bosniak (Bosnian Muslims' preferred name for themselves) estimates from the Bosnian Institute for Public Health, and Bosniak academic Mustafa Imamovic were giving figures along the lines of 150,000 deaths.\n\nAlso, people get estimates of body counts wrong. Early estimates of the Holocaust death toll from people like Reitlinger and Hilberg are now widely considered too low. Nothing new, and too high figures being reported by the media are just as explainable, if not more so, by general sensationalism. For the record, the [media have often reported high figures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4747379.stm) for the Operation Storm refugees as well (though not quite as high as Herman).\n\n&gt; But the mainstream media used the word \"genocide\" 323 times in describing what happened to the Kosovo Muslims, versus 80 times for the Iraq sanctions, which involved 200 times as many civilian deaths, and they used it only 17 times for deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which involved over a thousand times more deaths than in Kosovo.\n\nI can't claim to know that much about any of these topics and the accuracy of Herman's figures, but I do know that intent and motive is a crucial part of genocide that Herman is omitting in this. Crucially, you have to be targeting a particular ethnic/religious group of people. Genocide is not simply killing a lot  of people, and there are plenty of instances of huge killings that generally aren't referred to as genocide, such as the Rape of Nanking.\n\n&gt; In fact, the 8,000 is now taken as possibly an underestimate -- the EU resolution of January 15, 2009 speaks of \"more than 8,000\" and this is commonplace.  It will be recalled that the initial 9-11 estimate of deaths from the New York City Trade Center attack -- 6,886 -- fell subsequently to 2,749, a decline of 60 percent.\n\n6,886 was the initial number reported *missing* after 9/11, not dead.\n\n&gt; The figure for Muslim dead in Bosnia fell from some 250,000 in 1992-3 to fewer than 100,000 today, a fall of well over 60 percent. \n\nThese are estimates of total deaths, not just Muslims.\n\n&gt; But Srebrenica's number stays the same -- not because it is based on evidence, but because it is so central and useful a political construct, and is repeated by members of the establishment with the assurance of true believers.\n\nYeah, all genocide deniers say something similar.\n\n&gt; The 8,000 is sustained in part because the follow-up list of missing persons eventually assembled was done by means of an appeal to the Bosnian Muslim population to come forward with names of the missing.  Again, by the continuing miracle, this list still approximates 8,000.  But it was not collected on any kind of scientific basis, and it has been found that some of the names are of men who died before July 1995, quite a few seem to have voted in the 1996 election\n\nHerman gives no source for such a claim, though I have heard the claim that a couple of thousand Srebrenica victims were listed as voting in local elections in early 1996. But what that actually tells us is the completely non-shocking revelation that Republika Srpska (the Serb breakaway state in Bosnia, now one half of Bosnia's double-entity system), just a few months after the end of the war, didn't have updated voter lists and anti-electoral fraud mechanisms. Dr Helge Brunborg analysed updated voting lists from 1997 and 1998 for ICTY, and found that the total number of listed Srebrenica missing appearing on those voting lists was *nine* - and as he pointed out, this could also just be voter fraud, or simply an administrative error.\n\n&gt; and the number has never been sustained by forensic evidence.  **As late as 2001** the ICTY had only located some 2,100 bodies in the Srebrenica area, not many identified or shown to have been July 1995 Srebrenica victims.\n\nI felt I had to put these astoundingly stupid four words in bold. Herman, writing an article on an event that happened just 15 years earlier, is quoting figures and research from *9 years earlier*. Does it not occur to him that more research might have been done since then?\n\nAs a matter of fact, it has. I don't know exactly what the \"exhumation count\" was in 2010, when Herman is writing, but by 2012 it was between 6,500 and 7,000.\n\n(cont. in comments below)",

        "text": "A co-worker if mine recently told me that the Middle Ages were invented and that \"Charlemagne wasn't even real, dude.\" (He then made motions as if his head was exploding).\nI wrote a blog post about this, but practically nobody reads that thing and then I found /r/badhistory and I thought you guys might appreciate it.\n\nHere is my post reformatted for reddit. \n\nIn the early 1990’s a few German \"historians\" came out with a radical new idea, it is known in the U.S. as “Phantom Time” or the “Invented Middle Ages.” The proponents included Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, who studied mathematics, engineering, aeronautics, and had an interest in history (as well as “German New Medicine”), and Heribert Illig who studied German and became known for his “Chronological Criticism” in which he suggested that Egyptian history was off by about two thousand years, Paleolithic cave paintings were much closer to our time, and then finally came to believe that 297 years had been erroneously inserted in the European timeline. Most of what they have written has not been translated into English, which makes it hard to research for someone here in the U.S., but this doesn’t stop people from spreading the idea online and offline.\n\nHere is a paper from a lecture given by Illig in 2005:\n\n[http://www.bearfabrique.org/Catastrophism/illig_paper.htm](http://www.bearfabrique.org/Catastrophism/illig_paper.htm)\n\nHe says, “As an example of such an axiom, consider this statement: the accepted time line is God-given and therefore does not need to be checked. In my study of Ancient Egypt I learned that entire periods may be written up in books, even though they have not left any traces on earth and, more importantly, in the earth. I was thus forewarned when I started looking at the history of the Middle Ages.”\n\nHere is a paper written by Niemitz in 1997: \n[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf)\n\nHe provides sources but primarily sites himself and Illig. His chief argument in the paper is this:\n\n“In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII started the so-called ‘Gregorian calendar’, which is basically a corrected version of the old Julian calendar of Julius Caesar. The Julian calendar, after being used for a long time, no longer corresponded with the astronomical situation. The difference, according to calculations by Pope Gregory, amounted to 10 days. Now please calculate: how many Julian years does it take to produce an error of 10 days? The answer is 1257 years. The question – at which date was the Julian calendar correct – can be calculated with the following amazing result (Illig 1991): 1582 – 1257 = 325 (The year in which the “Gregorian” calendar began minus the years necessary to produce 10 days of error in the Julian calendar equals the beginning the Julian calendar.) It seems, unbelievably, that Caesar introduced his calendar in 325 AD.”\n\nThe problem here seems to be simple misunderstanding. The Gregorian Calendar was not made to bring the calendar in line with the start of the Julian Calendar (45 BC), but instead to put it in line with the Council of Nicaea (325 CE). The problem with the calendar in 1582 was that the equinoxes of spring and fall were too far off their real astronomical days. This specifically caused problems because Easter, the most important day in the Christian calendar at the time, was determined (this was decided at the Council of Nicaea) based on the spring equinox. This caused problems with lining Easter up with Passover and thus lining up all the other Christian feast days of the time- because many were based on Easter.\n\nAs they explain in the Galileo Project from Rice University [http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html](http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html):\n\n“In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII (hence the name Gregorian Calendar) ordered ten days to be dropped from October, thus restoring the vernal (spring) equinox at least to an average of the 20th of March, close to what it had been at the time of the Council of Nicaea.”\n\nBut let us not rely on the words of the esteemed intellects of Rice University, but instead go here: [http://www.bluewaterarts.com/calendar/NewInterGravissimas.htm](http://www.bluewaterarts.com/calendar/NewInterGravissimas.htm) \nwhich is a wonderful translation from scholar Dr. William Spencer from the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary of the papal bull from 1582 which established the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIt reads, “One notes in examining this (the book which proposed the Gregorian Calendar by Luigi Lilio) that it is necessary to rule at the same time on three points to restore the celebration of Easter according to rules fixed by previous Roman pontiffs, particularly Pius I (140-154) and Victor I (189-198) (who established Easter’s celebration on Sunday), and by the fathers of the councils, in particular those of the great ecumenical council of Nicaea.”\n\nThe drop of ten days was then to coincide with the timing of Easter at the Council of Nicaea, not the beginning of the Julian Calendar.\n\n1582 - 1257 = 325\n\nThe start of the Gregorian Calendar (1582) minus the years necessary to produce ten erroneous days (1257) equals the year of the Council of Nicaea (325).\n\nSo it would seem that the math is simple and perfectly fine, the labeling is, unfortunately, incorrect. Niemitz in his paper seems to act as though 325 were a random year and did not coincide with one of the most important gatherings in Christian history, which is specifically mentioned in the papal bull that established the new calendar.\n\nYet, Niemitz’s thesis, as he explains, is not just that Gregorian Calendar is off, but that it is off by almost 300 years and that these years are specifically “inserted between 600 AD and 900 AD, either by accident, by misinterpretation of documents or by deliberate falsification (Illig 1991).”\n\nSince the Gregorian Calendar was officially created in 1582 AD, the Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, and the Julian Calendar was created in 45 BC, the question becomes why are the fabricated years between 600 and 900 AD? Why not 400 and 700 AD? 100 and 400 AD?\n\nIllig explains, “What started me off was a phone call from a friend. He was looking into forgeries in the Middle Ages. In 1986 there had been a conference on this subject in Munich, the results of which were reprinted in six volumes totaling 3,700 pages. The final talk was given by Prof Horst Fuhrmann, then president of ‘Monumenta Germaniae Historica’, the institution that prepares the critical edition of the old and oldest German documents. Fuhrmann talked of ‘forgeries with anticipatory character’”\n\nHorst Fuhrmann was a noted German historian and he was specifically well known for his work in forgeries from the Middle Ages. He found several forgeries and indicated that some seemed to have what he called an “anticipatory character,” that is that the motivation for their forgery didn’t become apparent until hundreds of years after they were supposedly created. Fuhrmann, however, never suggested that the reason for this was because of an invented 297 years. The simple truth is that forgeries are hard to date. A researcher cannot, obviously, go off the date given for the document, but because the forgery is an attempt to conceal its true origin, it is hard to say when exactly a forgery was made. Yet, there is no reason at this time to question Fuhrmann’s research, it is not the subject of this post. The issue is that Illig and Niemitz have taken this discrepancy in forgeries and invented their own elaborate explanation, which is a clear example of a conspiracy theory.\n\nThey took a simple observation from Fuhrmann and a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Gregorian Calendar and came upon the idea that these missing years must have been between 600 to 900 AD. They then gave what they consider evidence to support their theory, but it is all circumstantial and ignores other perfectly reasonable explanations- the hallmark of the conspiracy theory.\n\nThey claim that the chapel in Aachen has a style that “appears” to them to be two hundred years before it “should” have been built. They claim that there is not enough archaeological evidence for the years 600 to 900, at times claiming that archaeologists purposefully added material just to support the “God-given” conclusion that the years 600 to 900 existed. Niemitz partially sites himself when he writes, “Thus the absent period was construed by layers – composed of waste and ceramic fragments from other locations – which were spread to fill in the gap and support known chronology (Stamm 1962; Niemitz 1993)”\n\nStamm, it should be noted, was a German archaeologist who is believed to have construed the origins of one of his finds as being from the time of Charlemagne, when it was actually from the 13th century. This is unfortunate, of course, but does not prove the idea of an invented Middle Ages, simply that one archaeologists was inaccurate and possibly deceitful.\n\nNiemitz points to the fact that there is little evidence of towns in Germany of this time, except for the presence of churches. These churches are conveniently ignored, as are the following points: the birth of Muhammed and the rise of Islam, which spread from Central Asia to Spain between 600 to 900 AD, the Chinese Tang Dynasty which ruled at this time and all of their archives, the recorded astrological events of the time period such as the arrivals of Haley’s Comet, the reigns of countless monarchs, the writings of scholars, the actual archaeological evidence that comes from this time period on all continents throughout the world. These are all misunderstanding or fabrications designed by a world-wide conspiracy to add to the historical record 300 years that never really happened.\n\nOne must wonder- why would anyone go to these great lengths to invent 300 years? Who would do such a thing?\n\nIllig says it plainly, “I therefore designated Emperors Constantine VII and Otto III and Pope Sylvester II as the authors of this interpolation.”\n\nHere the theory seems to take a turn into another realm altogether. There is no evidence given as to how these men perpetrated this seemingly impossible hoax. Illig claims that in his research of Charlemagne, he determined that the man was larger than life and so must be myth. Yet he gives to these men an impossible task- fabricate 300 years of global history to such an extent that it would dupe ever single person on the planet for hundreds of years until a few conspiracy theorists came along and figured it all out. Illig does explain, in his mind, the reason why these three men decided to fake three hundred years: “The motive, at least in the west, was apparently an eschatological one: Otto III felt that he was Christ's representative and vicar on earth, who would ring in the last 1000 years on earth.” In other words, Otto wanted to be sure that he was king in the year 1000 AD, because, according to Illig, it had great religious significance. We must assume this was the reason for the other leaders to become involved.\n\nOtto III would have then had to create this worldwide conspiracy while becoming and maintaining his crown as Holy Roman Emperor, something that there is no record of any other person doing ever in the history of time. By Illig’s logic, this would make Otto III larger than life, an impossibility, and so therefore we can only conclude Otto III was most likely a fabrication of some later ruler, though Illig never says who this could be.\n\nOne of the many troublesome parts of this theory is that there’s no connection between the principal people involved in the forgery of those centuries and those that seemed to cement it into history by creating the Gregorian calendar, which we must remember only shaved off ten days to put Easter closer to its date during the Council of Nicaea.\n\nThe implication is that Pope Gregory and his other officials, and presumably the Italian astronomer who suggest taking away ten days, all knew that 300 years had been made up and so were covering for a long dead German Emperor, a pope, and the emperor of a place, Byzantium, that no longer existed. Such is the nature of conspiracy theories that, conveniently, anyone can be aware of the conspiracy or unaware of it to suit the needs of those who argue for its existence. Conspiracies, we must assume, leave no paper trail and so are not able to be proven in the conventional sense. Anything that goes against the conspiracy has been planted, forged, and only shows how deep the conspiracy goes. Scientific dating cannot be trusted, of course. ",

        "text": "In a twitter conversation last night, one person suggested that the language used by medieval lords to describe serfs and peasants is not unlike that used by modern slaveowners about their slaves or capitalists to describe workers. That's fair enough; however we want to deconstruct the social and economic systems of medieval Europe or the US South, there are some important similarities, and what this shows me more than anything else is that the moralizing language of elites is durable. It can be adapted to many different social and economic systems. \n\nAnother person, however, went all-in, and decided that medieval society and racism in the US South were *literally* the same thing. How do we know? Triangles. When I suggested that they were only the same from a very large perspective, and that the differences were vitally important and should not be overlooked, they responded with these two images and no further comment. \n\n[Exhibit A](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJSrWiKUsAA3LWl.png)\n\n[Exhibit B](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJSrWh5VAAAzGHO.png)\n\nI find this comparison deeply troubling. All it really shows is that hierarchies can be arranged into shapes; the actual mechanisms that articulated and maintained these hierarchies were very different. In medieval Europe, there's an explicit and nuanced hierarchy of ranks ranging from emperors, kings, and popes down to the lowest serf of bonded laborers, but with many, many shades in between, with many of them not fitting neatly into the hierarchy: free peasants, minor nobility, lay brothers, and so on. Their social and economic relations, moreover, are governed through customs and traditions that grant and protect certain privileges and responsibilities, such as access to common lands (which medieval peasants and serfs were fiercely protective of) or labor obligations. These rules varied widely from place to place, with different kinds of privileges and responsibilities everywhere you went. Further, while the Church might have offered a pretty explicit endorsement of these relationships, the ability of medieval states to actually enforce them was fairly suspect. There was no permanent police force, no disciplinary system of prisons, and limited ability to survey land and people.\n\nSlavery and its descendant in the US South, however, operated on much different principles: capitalism and scientific racism. Rather than a messy, locally-constructed system of rights, privileges, and obligations contested over a very long term, plantation slavery and later share-cropping relied on the simpler and more universal systems of capitalism and science. Slaves were literally humans as commodities, pure labor with no rights and privileges; they were in constant danger of direct violence from their masters, could be sold at any time, and could be outright killed without consequence. The only real limit on the masters' actions were profit, loss, and the amount of violence they could deploy at a given moment. This system was sanctioned by a whole profession of scientists and doctors who developed forms of expertise that demonstrated--to their minds--the immutable differences between whites and blacks and the obvious and permanent superiority of the former over the latter. Plus, the state was far more invested in maintaining this racial hierarchy and its labor system, and far more able to do so: state interventions were much more intrusive, with police, judicial, and prison systems contributing a great deal.\n\nSo, there certainly ARE important similarities: both are agrarian societies in which the wealthy control access to and proceeds from land and agriculture, and both use social hierarchies to obligate labor on that land and therefore their own benefit. However, if we collapse these into a single thing and say that they are the same because of triangles, then--despite what I'm sure was this person's point--we're actually ignoring the differences between them and thus the different means that might be deployed to combat them.",

The Swahili states, Mali, Ghana (the original one), Songhai, Sokoto, Zimbabwe, Monomotapa, Zulu, Oyo, Kongo, Benin, Shilluk, Ajuraan, Mapungubwe, and the Great Lakes kingdoms apparently are all objectively inferior to mighty Ethiopia.\n\n&gt;D--ethiopia was already colonized by abyssinian.[ref.map.01]\n\nThey are *the same country!* \"Ethiopia\" is the Greek name and \"Abyssinia\" is the Yemeni Arabic name. It would be like saying \"when did Germany conquer Allemagne?\" The monarch simply chose in the 1930s to adopt the Greek form of the name, not the Arabic one.\n\n&gt;E--ethiopia was the only christian country (excluding liberia and some ares of egypt) into the whole african continent with muslim, animist, traditionals religions prevalence\n\nEritrea, [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Makuria), Cape Verde, and the Kingdom of Kongo were also predominantly Christian but all fell victim to colonization (Cape Verde is an exception as it was a colony from Day One, but it isn't like Portugal said \"okay, they're Christian, we'll give them self-governance). \n\n&gt;F--ethiopia was never colonized permanently because of intervention of british/indians during the WWII\n\nI don't know enough about WWII history to answer this one, but \"never *permanently* colonized\" =/= \"never colonized.\" Also, the \"Indians\" would still have been British subjects as the only self-governing Indian state, Azad Hind, was a) an Axis member and b) controlled at most a few sparsely-settled islands (Andaman and Nicobar) and pockets of Nagaland and Manipur along the Burmese border. [South Asians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Campaign_(World_War_II) fought alongside recruits from throughout the British Empire in Africa and the Middle East, with substantial French and local support.\n\n&gt;I--because none of the colonial powers were interested to a poor country like ethiopia except italy that comes last to the \"colonization process\" in an already completely partitioned continent.[map.02]\n\nPoverty wasn't the reason Ethiopia wasn't conquered. [Westerners tried and failed to conquer it well after the rest of Africa was partitioned.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Adwa) Also, many very poor and backwards parts of Africa (like Botswana) were colonized well [11 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechuanaland_Protectorate) before the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.",

Other indications that this was his primary concern were the enactment of lend lease for Great Britain and the transfer of 50 overage U.S. destroyers to the Royal Navy. FDR even lied to the public that Nazi U-boat attacks on American warships were unprovoked, when in fact the opposite was true. Hitler, who found himself in a desperate struggle after invading Soviet Russia and could not conquer England had strictly ordered his U-boat commanders not to attack American-flag vessels. Moreover, the U.S. Navy also violated neutrality by sending the Royal Navy information on the position of the German battleship Bismarck in May, 1941, that led to its destruction.\n\n&gt;If FDR wanted an excuse to fight Japan he had every reason when the gunboat U.S.S. Panay was sunk by Japanese aviators in China’s Yangtze River in 1937 but he knew his Asiatic Fleet and the Philippine army were unready for war. This was still true in 1941 when Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall was telling FDR that he wouldn’t have enough Flying Fortresses based in the Philippines for war until April, 1942. Marshall put great stock in the bomber and told reporters at an off-the-record press conference in November 1941, that if war broke out Japan’s wood and paper cities would be scorched by the warplane, as later proved to be true with its B-29 successor. Another indication the Pearl Harbor attack was a surprise is that the B-17s that arrived from the States as Pearl Harbor was under fire did not even have their machine guns in place.\n\nhttps://www.laprogressive.com/pearl-harbor-conspiracy-theories/",

Some good, some bad. But the deception of health always precedes their downfall because people grow lazy, entitled, irrational, unreasonable and irresponsible. The mental disease of liberalism can only grow, like a fungus, in untended areas.

The \"real\" or \"Freedom\" title of the book is the much more sober and German-sounding *The Fall of Rome: The Dissolution of the Roman Empire*.\n\nAnyway, as I can't seem to find an online English translation of the book, it looks like the list he drew up was actually of *all* of the things that have been blamed for the decline of the Western Roman Empire. It includes reasonable entries such as agrarian slavery, lead poisoning, religious struggles and schism, and soil exhaustion, as well as a few strange ones such as bastardization, [\"bolshevization\"](http://cdn2.crushable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/honeybooboogif.gif), [\"decline of Nordic character\"](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3tkmyYyd01rodf0w.gif), and both abolition of the gods AND polytheism.\n\nEDIT: the \"fall\" of Rome: what really happened: a non-Marilyn Manson type of Goth was like, [\"hey gimme that.\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Young_Folks%27_History_of_Rome_illus420.png) A lively debate on how Odo was able to just up and take it has been a favorite past time of people like me with too much time on our hands for a long time (see Gibbon, Edward; The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire), but the evidence for homosexuality being the cause of it is scant. Something which directly contradicts that homosexuality was that accepted in the late Western Roman Empire is a passage in the Codex Theodosianus, promulgated in 429CE, which proscribes homosexual behavior (by men). I regret to inform you that I have not been able to find an online source for this-- I first read about it in a history class about ten years ago.",

        "text": "Hello Badhistorians!\n\nI have mixed feelings about Canada day. On the one hand, having a Wednesday off was fun and I like barbecue and beer. On the other hand, patriotism and nationalism really bums me out. I feel like being proud of the happenstance of your birth above the 49th parallel is sad. \n\nSo to burst everyone's bubble, I've decided to peel back the thin veneer of the national myth surrounding our favourite boys in red, the Northwest Mounted Police.\n\nExample of the myth is [here](np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3bv4tu/why_does_canada_say_its_sorry_so_often_xpost_from/cspy0h1).\n\nTLDR - Canada's rough and rugged Mounties kept order out west, allowing our government to expand in a \"civilized\" manner compared to our violent brothers down south.\n\nHowever, this is all bullshit. Well, not total bullshit. Mostly bullshit.\n\nFirst off, some facts about the Mounties. In 1876, Sir John A. Macdonald formed the Northwest Mounted Rifles as a paramilitary group to extend Canada's control over the newly purchased western territories. However, fearing negative reaction from our much beefier neighbours, the name was changed to the Northwest Mounted Police.\n\nThe formation of such a paramilitary group was paramount. The Red River and Northwest Rebellions proved a military presence was necessary on the frontier. American whisky runners were also setting up forts like Fort Whoop-Up out west that threatened Canadian sovereignty and caused general unrest among Metis, First Nations and Settler communities. Canada's borders were incredibly porous and the British and Canadian governments needed to make sure the Americans did not start settling willy-nilly in Canadian sovereign territory.\n\nThis formation is actually relatively late in Canada's westward expansion. The colonies of New Westminster, Victoria and Hasting's Mill (later to be renamed Granville then Vancouver) were already established. The Klondike gold rush was over and many settlers stayed behind.\n\nViolence at this point was already pervasive across the Canadian frontier. With no rail or dedicated routes, most settlements actually had no Mounties to protect them. Local justice was the norm across most of the territories.\n\nThe myth of the civilized west was really cemented during the Klondike Gold Rush and the prospector's impression of Dawson City. While compared to American boom towns Dawson was a city of law and order, it was, in reality, still a wild-west city. Prostitution and gambling were tolerated. Guns were regulated, but not uncommon. Shootouts with native groups were still common outside of Dawson City itself. Rape and physical violence were the norm. All of this was under the watch of the NWMP.\n\nThe reality of the NWMP was one of Canadian practicality. They were a mobile military force that were first and foremost created to protect sovereignty. While policing was definitely part of their role, and eventually what their role wholly entailed, the origins of the Mounties were closer to the US Cavalry.\n\nCanada's western expansion was just as violent as the US - we just like to tone it down in our national mythology.\n\nAlso, some Canadiana - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ub9tLW5Ino\n\nSources:\n\n[Westward Bound: Sex, Violence, the Law, and the Making of a Settler Society – Lesley Erickson](http://www.amazon.ca/Westward-Bound-Violence-Settler-Society/dp/077481859X)\n\n[Wikipedia - NWMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-West_Mounted_Police)\n",

That was my first thought when I saw [this giant turd burger](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8884885/american-revolution-mistake) that the Hamburglar had dropped on my door step the other morning. I already have a very low opinion of Vox but this just really takes the cake. Before I get into detail I will say that I think I know where the writer was going with this. Its a reaction to the sweeping narratives of American history that focus on the WASPs rolling back the frontier with enlightened civilization. These narratives very rarely include the stories of minority groups such as Native Americans, Slaves, African-Americans, and Women. The only problem is that the writer is acting like he’s the first person to ever find out that horrible things actually happened in American history. DAE know that the Founding Fathers owned slaves?!? I guess the past 40+ years of change within the academic historical community never happened. I most have imagined that we talked about that endlessly in my historiography classes. His three main arguments are 1)Abolition would have come faster 2) Independence was bad for Native Americans 3)Britain has a better system of government. I just wish I could ask him one question. **WHY THE EVERLIVING SHIT WOULD YOU PUBLISH THIS TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FOURTH OF JULY!** If your goal was to publish some anti-American screed right before the Fourth so you can get #clicks and page views to help build your #brand and live by the notion that any publicity is good publicity. Without further ado here it is.\n\n&gt;3 Reasons Why the American Revolution Was a Mistake \n\nHmmm thats odd. Maybe I should check it out. It can’t be *that* bad.  \n\n&gt;This July 4th, I'm celebrating by taking a plane from the US to the United Kingdom. The timing wasn't intentional, but I embrace the symbolism. \n\nOh no. I think I see where this is going.\n\n&gt;American independence in 1776 was a monumental mistake. We should be mourning the fact that we left the United Kingdom, not cheering it.\n\n[Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1dnqKGuezo)\n\n&gt;Of course, evaluating the wisdom of the American Revolution means dealing with counterfactuals. As any historian would tell you, this is messy business. \n\nBut I bet you’re going to go into counterfactuals anyway, aren't ya?\n\n&gt;But I'm reasonably confident a world where the revolution never happened would be better than the one we live in now.\n\nYep he is going to do it. Historians can’t deal in counterfactuals. It is way too speculative, especially when it comes to something as monumental as the British Empire holding on to its American colonies. You can not confidently say that America would have turned out for the better, especially not in a think piece that mimics a Cracked or Buzzfeed article with its lists. If you’re going to argue that at least research, write, and publish an academic work citing respected primary and secondary sources not whatever shit you used to write this pile.\n\nHis first item of business is the abolition of slavery, which he argues would have happened earlier, citing the abolition of slavery in the British Isles in the 1770s and the abolition of slavery everywhere in the Empire by 1843. I'm a huge fan of Wilberforce so the only fault I have with this is the neglect of context (there hadn’t been much slavery in the Isles anyway; even after slavery was abolished in Indian things were generally shitty for the Indians unless the Sepoy Mutiny and numerous nation-wide famines are figments of my imagination.)\n\n&gt;For the vast majority of the country — its women, slaves, American Indians — the difference between disenfranchisement in an independent America and disenfranchisement in a British-controlled colonial America was negligible. If anything, the latter would've been preferable, since at least women and minorities wouldn't be singled out for disenfranchisement.\n\nWait what do you mean they were singled out? There were still property requirements that white males had to meet in order to vote, and it isn’t like any of the groups listed had a say in British politics anyway.\n\n&gt;It's true that, had the US stayed, Britain would have had much more to gain from the continuance of slavery than it did without America. It controlled a number of dependencies with slave economies — notably Jamaica and other islands in the West Indies — but nothing on the scale of the American South. Adding that into the mix would've made abolition significantly more costly.\n\nWould Britain have abolished slavery if its southern colonies were dependent on slave labor to produce cotton, the same cotton that was necessary for the textile mills in Britain? Would Eli Whitney have even invented the cotton gin, helping to contribute to the cotton boom? We have no damn clue, which is exactly why you can’t start throwing out counterfactuals. \n\nHe then goes on to talk about the Revolutionary War and Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation like he is the first person to figure out some grand secret that *le gasp* some of the Founding Fathers had a large financial stake in slavery.\n\n&gt;This is not to say the British were motivated by a desire to help slaves; of course they weren't.\n\nThen why did you make it seem like it was?\n\n&gt;Independence was bad for Native Americans\n\nWhat are the odds on some good ol’ “Noble Savage” here?\n\n&gt;But all the same, the policy enraged American settlers, who were appalled that the British would seem to side with Indians over white men.\n\nSide with or just show an equal hand towards both? Because his reference just after this makes it seem like the latter.\n\nNext he discusses Le Glorious Canadians and theProclamation of 1763, how it formed the basis of Canadian-Native American(Native Canadian?) relationships. But then he says this \n\n&gt;They still committed horrible, indefensible crimes. Canada, under British rule and after, brutally mistreated aboriginal people, not least through government-inflicted famines and the state's horrific seizure of children from their families so they could attend residential schools.\n\nDoes he realize what he just said? Holy moving goalposts and self-contradictions Batman.\n\n&gt;But the country didn't experience a Westward expansion as violent and deadly as that pursued by the US government and settlers. Absent the revolution, Britain probably would've moved into Indian lands. But fewer people would have died.\n\nHow does he know that? Nobody can know that or argue that definitively. How would the Napoleonic Wars played out with America still a British colony? And I feel like he is ignoring factors like climate, geography, and population growth/density when talking about westward expansion. Maybe its just me but I don’t think that the Yukon, Northwestern Territories, and Nunavut are as conducive to settlement as say Colorado, Utah, etc.. \n\n&gt;None of this is to minimize the extent of British and Canadian crimes against Natives.\n\nNo, that is exactly what you’re doing. \n\n&gt; \"It's a hard case to make because even though I do think Canada's treatment of Natives was better than the United States, it was still terrible,\" the Canadian essayist Jeet Heer tells me in an email (Heer has also written a great case against American independence). \"On the plus side for Canada: there were no outright genocides like the Trail of Tears\n\nAt this point I wanted to use my iPad like a Frisbee. You can’t just label an incident a genocide if you damn well please. (I am in now way making excuses for the American government for how they treated the Native Americans.) You could argue that what happened to Native Americans was cultural genocide because of how the governments of both America and Canada removed children from their homes, shipped them to boarding schools in the East, and tried to remove every aspect of their culture. And it isn’t like the British have a great track record when it comes to they treated native populations (Ireland, India, Kenya, the Zulu.) So stop making it seem like the Americans are the worst people to ever walk the earth because it fits your argument. \n\n&gt;American Indians would have still, in all likelihood, faced violence and oppression absent American independence, just as First Nations people in Canada did. But American-scale ethnic cleansing wouldn't have occurred.\n\nWe don’t know that for a fact and there he goes again, tossing out terms like genocide and ethnic cleansing all willy-nilly.\n\nAnd here is his 3rd reason.\n\n&gt;America would have a better system of government if we'd stuck with Britain\n\nJumping right into the deep end of the pool of personal opinion I see. \n\n&gt;And parliamentary democracies are a lot, lot better than presidential ones. They're significantly less likely to collapse into dictatorship because they don't lead to irresolvable conflicts between, say, the president and the legislature. They lead to much less gridlock.\n\nThat link is to another Vox article. Political history/theory isn’t really my strong suit but from what I do remember from German history courses is that the fractured nature of parliamentary democracy in Weimar Germany didn’t exactly help. There was so much chaos in the government because the numerous parties weren’t able to get anything done and the people lost faith in the democratic process. So I think he is completely wrong here but I’m more than willing to admit that I might be wrong. \n\nHe really lets his politics come through in this section and you can guess as to what they are. [Not that there is anything wrong with that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3VphK9AMk)\n\n&gt;Finally, we'd still likely be a monarchy, under the rule of Elizabeth II, and constitutional monarchy is the best system of government known to man. \n\nWe can’t say that for certain since we could be an independent nation by now. We have no way of knowing. And it would be nice if he included some sources to back up that sweeping claim but that is asking too much I guess. \n\n&gt;And monarchs are better.\n\nNice link to an article that you wrote yourself buddy.\n\n&gt;Monarchs are more effective than presidents precisely because they lack any semblance of legitimacy.\n\nWait say what? Is he just babbling at this point, throwing out big words and hoping they stick?\n\nThe majority of this guys sources were either Wikipedia posts or articles from Vox and Gawker, or even personal blog posts. I see where he wanted to go with this but he set it on fire and drove it off a cliff right from the beginning. \n\nIt appears that our esteemed writer has been hit with Second Option Bias, which /u/NMW explains very well [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pqzx5/objectively_speaking_what_the_nazi_regime_did_is/cd54xw0). I’m going to assume that he was taught the GRAND AMERICAN NARRATIVE from an early age and was told how America is the greatest country to ever walk the earth, America never did anything wrong, and an eagle dropped off a baby George Washington rather than a stork. We’ve pretty much all been taught that. And its only natural to change your opinion when you learn more, especially when you learn about the bad stuff in American history. The only problem is when someone gets stuck in second option bias, stuck on the polar opposite scale from the GAN. It is just as intellectually dishonest as the first. To the writer, yeah some countries have done bad things BUT LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH WORSE AMERICA IS. He fell into the same trap as many others have. He’s robbing history of its context and making it all black and white. There is no nuance when either extreme view is held, and generally nuance is a good thing. I like nuance and you should too.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Howdy there folks, /u/Bull3tM0nk3y here, long time fan of BadHistory, first time doing a post like this. I just gotta say that this place is simple awesome, one of the reasons why I stay on reddit. History and comedy rolled into wonder posts, some by actual historians from /r/AskHistorians.\n\nBut anyways, a few months ago, I was shifting my political opinion. Am I a liberal? Socialist? Communist? I knew I was left-wing, as I was for more government control and regulations of things, but also thought the government was getting too big. So, like any good 17 year old redditor did, I subscribed to a few political subs of different world views. /r/communism was one of them. I quickly went “This subreddit is… kinda off.”\n\nPeople defended Mao, Stalin, the Kim Jong family line, and so on. Really? Defending some of the arguably worst world leaders? Trying to say that Stalin did nothing wrong? And no, they’re serious, and we’re mocking the Hitler did nothing wrong joke from 4Chan.\n\nBut the turning point for me was [http://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2pwxm5/the_debunking_anticommunism_masterpost/](This post by /u/Oliverhart, made ~6 months ago, and edited 24 days ago, as I’m writing up this possibly massive prodject.) It’s the highest upvoted post on /r/communism with ~265 upvotes. This post cover several topics from several points from history. From Stalin’s rule of the USSR, to Mao, to Castro, to Che, to current day North Korea.\n\nIt’s a huge [Gish Gallop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_gallop), using anywhere from 4 to 11 citations for every thing this OP tries to defend and/or correct. The issue isn’t that he’s using a lot of citations, well, it is, but the point is that they use Wordpress blogs, and baised sites like RadialRevolution. FYI, blogs aren’t the best place for information, let alone historical and scientific fact. There’s no review by peers and kin, no need to have anyone test it, or have historians actually give a damn about some person on Tumblr or Livejournal says what really caused the Fall of Rome.\n\nWell, I’m putting off the inevitable. I’ve wanted to do this post for a little while, so let’s get to it.\n\n&gt;Almost daily, this forum rehashes decades-old chestnuts about communist history, ranging from cold war tales of poverty and famine, to ludicrous myths about alleged genocides. To reduce the clutter, I'll present some basic resources refuting these myths. If you have suggested additions for the database, just let me or another admin know, and odds are we'll throw it up here.\n\nI assume by this fourm, he means Reddit. Cold War tales of Poverty and Famine? [Ignoring that the USSR said it themselves that it was really happening in 1989, yeah, sure, they didn’t happen.](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-01-30/news/8903010453_1_soviet-officials-rubles-poverty) I’ll get to the “myths of genocide” real soon.\n\n&gt;#SECTION 1: THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE\n\n&gt;##ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 1: THE SOVIET UNION MANUFACTURED A FAMINE IN UKRAINE\n\nThe OP gives us 4 citations here, 1 of which is RadicalRevolution, and a dead link to a book, which after looking up [actually talks about how it really was made by the USSR](http://www.amazon.com/The-Years-Hunger-Agriculture-Industrialization/dp/0333311078) but, whatever. And I don’t have time, nor money to spend $167.93 and read a book to prove an internet community wrong.\n\n[Here’s a book, titled Europe-Asia Studies, from 1964. Mainly, Volume 15, Issue 3.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/09668136408410364) I’ll try to copy what I’m able to read from their preview scan of the first page of this chapter.\n\n&gt;”Food is a weapon.” Maxim Litinov\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union has made much of its own process of rapid economic development. It has, however, said little of the social costs that were involved. Perhaps the most severe of these was the great famine which raged from 1932 to 1934.\n\n&gt;Although this famine appears to have resulted in the death of approximately five million people--placing it well among the worst famines of all time--it is scarcely known today.\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union, in fact, has never offically admitted that the famine existed. American and English studies on Russia occasionally mention a famine in the Ukrane but generally provide few or no details. Yet, previous famines in Russia have been recorded elsewhere. Why the difference?\n\n&gt;The answer seems to be that the famine of 1932-34, unlike its predecessors, was a man-made disaster. It was an almost direct result of the economic and social policies followed by the Soviet government during its first five-year plan. To carry out its programme of rapid industrialization, the government felt that it needed to collectivize agriculture quickly. The disruptious growing out of collectivization led to the famine and death of millions of peasants.\n\n&gt;Obviously this is not a point that the Soviet leaders would wish to emphasize. And, in fact, they did such a good job of suppressing knowlage of it, that few today know of the famine, and even some wotherwise well-informed students of the Soviet Union suggest that the famine was of little conseqnce.\n\n&gt;This paper attempts to clarify the record by presenting a comprehensive and documented view of the man-made famine of 1932-1924.\n\nThe paper cuts off some more text for the next page, talking about how some people aren’t sure of the full effects and damage of the famine. It could have been a small amount of hunger, to the death of millions. However, it’s noting that I’ve found more credible sources documenting it.\nHere’s another book, titled, [Y Bilinsky - Journal of Genocide Research, 1999](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14623529908413948), and the following citations::\n\n*The man-made famine of 1933 in Soviet Ukraine JE Mace - Famine in Ukraine*, 1932, Teaching the Holodomor (Ukraine famine): *Issues of language, literary pedagogy, and learning* JP Robertson - Teaching for a tolerant world: Grades, 1999, *Holodomor: reflections on the Great Famine of 1932-1933 in Soviet Ukraine*, LY Luciuk, L Grekul - 2008 - Kashtan Press, *Famine in Ukraine*, 1932-1933 R Serbyn, B Krawchenko - 1986 - CIUS Press, *Famine and nationalism in Soviet Ukraine* JE Mace - Problems of Communism, 1984\n\n[Here’s some information about the censored 1937 Census, in Russian.](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/knigi/polka/gold_fund08.html) And here’s [the same link translated into English.](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdemoscope.ru%2Fweekly%2Fknigi%2Fpolka%2Fgold_fund08.html)\nThe article states that the reason why the Census was censored is due to the fact that Stalin said to the 17th Congress of the All-Soviet Union in 1935, that they expected a high birth rate, lower death rate, and better progress in general. Seems like a decent reason to censor a document if I was a dictator.

        "text": "[The offending History.com article in question (big surprise there)] (http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/battle-of-the-somme-begins)\n\nAs I'm sure many of you may be aware, /u/elos_, myself, and countless others have been fighting the good fight against Reddit-based WWI Badhistory. This is my first ever /r/badhistory post, and surprise surprise, it concerns History Channel and the Somme. Much of what I am posting is in [this /r/history thread] (https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3bs84i/99_years_ago_today_began_the_battle_of_the_somme/), but since /u/HockeyGoalie1 suggested this might sit well with fellow Shills of Big Historiography, 'Dux gon give it to ya'.\n\n&gt; When World War I broke out in August 1914, great throngs of British men lined up to enlist in the war effort. At the time, it was generally thought that the war would be over within six months.\n\nThere is no evidence that the 'War would be over by Christmas' was ever held in wide belief in 1914; so far as Adrian Gregory can tell in his work *The Last Great War*, it seems to have sprung up in later years, as a way of lampooning such optimism. [As I note in this /r/AskHistorians answer] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3bl50d/was_there_any_way_that_europeans_in_1914_could/), there was serious planning in Germany with regards to the likelihood of a prolonged struggle before 1914. Kitchener called up the new armies with the knowledge that they wouldn't be ready until 1915 at the very least, and he didn't expect the British Army to be making any major effort until at most 1916, more likely 1917 (in ol' K of K's words, \"The real war won't start until 1916\").\n\n&gt; On the Western Front–the battle line that stretched across northern France and Belgium–the combatants had settled down in the trenches for a terrible war of attrition.\n\nAttrition did not become the aim of Allied strategy until the Inter-Allied Conference at Chantilly in November, 1915. The stated goal of the General Allied Offensive next year would be the 'destruction of the enemy's armies', specifically those of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. For more info, I recommend William Phillpott's books *Bloody Victory* and *War of Attrition*.\n\n&gt; With the aim of raising enough men to launch a decisive offensive against Germany, Britain replaced voluntary service with conscription in January 1916, when it passed an act calling for the enlistment of all unmarried men between the ages of 18 and 41.\n\nThis had more to do with the fact that compulsion under the Derby Plan wasn't working, and Britain needed to institute a more organized system of providing the Army with manpower. Conscription, which was already utilized by all the major combatants, would weed out those men that were needed for vital war work, and thus ensure that industrial and military demands could be met efficiently. As Richard Holmes points out in *Tommy*, many conscripts would argue that they would have volunteered sooner or later, but conscription made that choice for them.\n\n&gt; Near the end of June, with the Battle of Verdun still raging, Britain prepared for its major offensive along a 21-mile stretch of the Western Front north of the Somme River.\n\nIt was not a solely British offensive; British 4th Army under Henry Rawlinson would attack along a 20 km front north of the Somme, but south of the Somme Emile Fayolle's French 6th Army would attack along a 10 km front. It was a joint offensive, coordinated by Ferdinand Foch, aimed at inflicting heavy losses on the German Army, and driving it from it's positions in Picardy, centered on the Thiepval-Combles Massif, Lassigny and the Flaucourt Plateau. It would also have the immediate effect of forcing the Germans to disengage from their offensive at Verdun, and give the French Army time to recuperate and counter-attack.\n\n&gt; For a week, the British bombarded the German trenches as a prelude to the attack. British Field Marshal Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, thought the artillery would decimate the German defenses and allow a British breakthrough; in fact, it served primarily to remove the element of surprise.\n\nHaig was C-in-C British Armies in France and Flanders; General Sir Henry Rawlinson was GOC 4th Army. Rawlinson was the one who decided on a methodical bombardment, and it made sense. Haig, for his part, wanted a short, hurricane barrage, but with the state and quantity of British shells and artillery, in tandem with the length of front and depth of enemy defences, this was unfeasible. Moreover, there was really no point in trying to achieve operational surprise on the Western Front: allied papers tracked the build-up; the Somme sector was where Franco-British lines met and thus the only place a joint offensive could be launched; the build-up required for an offensive was obvious to the enemy; and a methodical bombardment would ensure that the enemy's positions were thoroughly shelled, and would spare the British guns from excessive wear in a short time, which a hurricane bombardment would have entailed. There were plenty of officers and soldiers sceptical of the bombardment, and even it had worked, there still would have been bloody fighting ahead. It truly amazes me that the actions taken by *the enemy* don't seem to factor in when 'what went wrong on July 1st' comes to mind. For the view from 'the other side of the hill', consult *Through German Eyes* by Christopher Duffy and *German Army on the Somme 1914-16* by Jack Sheldon.\n",

Like you said about the victors\n\nOkay I searched the internet for this number and nothing came up, the wikipedia page on this had these estimations.\n\n&gt; According to Alice Kaplan, an American historian of France and chair of the Department of French at Yale University, the U.S. military tolerated rape of French women less than that of German women. She argued that the number of rapes is well documented and is less than that of some other armies during that era, writing that \"Nine hundred and four American soldiers were tried for rape in Europe, and even if the actual numbers were much higher, they do not compare with a terrible legacy of World War II-era rapes\" committed, for example, by the Japanese in Nanking, by Germans in the German-occupied areas, by the French in Italy and by the Soviet soldiers across Eastern Europe and Germany. J. Robert Lilly, Regents professor of sociology and criminology at Northern Kentucky University, reported in Taken by Force: Rape and American GIs in Europe in World War II his estimate that ***14,000*** rapes were committed by U.S. soldiers in France, Germany and the United Kingdom between 1942 and 1945. More specifically, Lilly estimated that U.S. servicemen committed around ***3,500*** rapes in France between June 1944 and the end of the war.\n&gt;     \n\nWell there you have it. There's much more to dissect there but i'll leave  that to you.\nA gold star for the first person who finds someone on that page comparing concentration camps to Japanese internment camps. \n",

        "text": "Ahhhh, finally some Soviet Badhistory that doesn't touch the second world war! Finally. My time has come. \n\n[The Badhistory in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2pwxm5/the_debunking_anticommunism_masterpost/)\n\nI'm going to use wikipedia for lots of background stuff. If its not explained well enough please just ask me to go into more depth. The post in question has a a load of sources that I consider to be either badhistory or strong examples of second opinion bias. The post contains links to works all over the communist world, I'll focus on the USSR because thats what I know about I'll cover them by section: \n\n&gt;ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 1: THE SOVIET UNION MANUFACTURED A FAMINE IN UKRAINE\n\n\n\n\nOK so this section features two authors, Douglas Tottle and Mark Tauger. First warning sign is I've never heard of either of them, so they seem to be outside the mainstream for Soviet Historians. Tottle's book is called Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard. He argues that the famine/holdomor was brought on by natural disasters and people resisting collectivization and dekulakization. For those of you not familiar with Soviet Agriculture, these were twin processes started under Stalin that removed farmers from private property and put them all to work on big 'collective farms' or KolHoz (Kollektivniya Hozistvya) as the Soviet abbreviation named them. Oh along with that it usually led to imprisonment or execution of the richest 'peasant farmers' \n\nAs an interesting aside, farming in the Russian Empire had just recently (comparatively) begun to be decollectivized. As part of the Stolypin reforms the village Mir was partially broken up and a class of small, landowning farmers was created. Not many mind you, but the ones who took advantage of this generally did well enough to get called Kulaks and shot. \n\nSo anyway, what do you suppose happens when you (after a vicious civil war) imprison or shoot the most productive part of your agricultural system and cause a massive disruption in the rest of the system? Yeah, a famine. The intent to create a famine might not have been there, but Soviet Actions did cause a famine, much in the way that the intent to cause a meltdown at Chernobyl might not have existed, but the actions of the plant engineers certainly caused one. \n\n&gt;ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 2: THE SOVIET UNION REPRESSED AND KILLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE\n\nWow. I am..wow. So this section contains works (none of the links to them work though) mainly by J. Arch Getty and Grover Furr. Again two authors I've never heard of. Getty seems to be mild. All he has to say is that the Great Purge might not have only been ordered and commanded by Stalin. A reasonable supposition. Furr though is quoted (on wikipedia again) as saying “I have spent many years researching this and similar questions and I have yet to find one crime… that Stalin committed.” . Ok. Maybe. I mean in that it wasn't a 'crime' in the Soviet Union to send people off to labor camps, or have them summarily executed, or torture confessions out of people. \n\nOn the other hand there's Perm-36, a recently closed Forced Labor camp turned into a museum/memorial that had numerous exhibitions on the falsely imprisoned, political prisoners. Or, you know, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch. To say nothing about my many many many students who had uncles, aunts, cousins, grandfathers, grandmothers, mothers and fathers spend some time in the camps. Or never came back form them. One of them got chased by the cops one time in the 1970's for having a Deep Purple album. Estonia (detailed at the Museum of the Occupation in Tallinn) lost about 25% of its population to either forced deportation or execution. Some of my Wife's family was forcibly moved at the beginning of World War II from the Western RSFSR to Siberia on the Yenisei river. The Chechens, the Crimean Tartars, all were forcibly relocated at some time when the Soviet Union existed. Many died during the journey, or because of lack of supplies. I'm honestly not sure what except totally intellectual dishonesty can cause people to think like this. \n\n\n\n&gt;ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 3: THE SOVIET UNION AND THE EASTERN BLOC HAD NO DEMOCRACY\n\nOk so this is technically correct, the best kind of correct to be. And yes there were elections, please cast your vote for the communist of your choice. \n\nHowever, when 'democracy' produced unexpected results, the consequences were shocking. Namely the 1956 Hungarian revolution and the 1968 Prague spring. Democracy was crushed – literally under the tank treads of the Red Army and brother nations of the Warsaw pact. \n\n&gt;ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 4: SOCIALISM IS AN ECONOMIC FAILURE\n\nThis is something for an economist to deal with. \n\n&gt;ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 5: EVERYBODY HATED SOCIALISM\n\nThis is a strawman. The reasons behind the break-up of the soviet Union are (gasp) varied and (shocking) complex. The Baltics, for example, always considered themselves to be occupied territory and so they weren't leaving the Soviet Union they were re-asserting their independence. But of all the reasons I've seen, I've never once seen “I hate Socialism” as a reason for breaking up the USSR. I could make some other comments about some of the sources listed in this section but it would swing really close to Rule 2 violation. I can expand on some of it if you want and if the mods promise to be merciful if I do fly to close to the sun that is R2. \n-----\nEdit : /u/International_KB [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3bti0b/refuting_communist_refutations/cspp3js) below as well.

        "text": "Over in /r/ShitStatistSay (I know, fish in a barrel) I found a delightfully clear example of the amazing libertarian view of history. [Talk a look at this gem:](https://np.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/3bognu/rand_paul_would_rather_end_marriage_than_share_it/cso59a8)\n\n&gt;These statists are completely oblivious to the fact that marriage license laws did not exist until the 20th century in most states. Nor do they realize state involvement in marriage originated to stop interracial marriage. (See Virginia Racial Integrity Act of 1913) \n\nI will ignore that marriage license claim. Libertarians, and now apparently the GOP, have convinced themselves that licenses are significant rather than paperwork. That belong is /r/badlaw (which does not exist). Instead let us go to that critical next sentence, something libertarians repeat frequently. So apparently there were no marriage laws before the 20th century. Now I could I suppose point to the [Married Women's Property Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Acts_in_the_United_States). These were a series of laws that started to give married women a few rights. These are actually important in regard to gay marriage since they are an early successful step toward marriage equality. I could point to the much older Common Law principle of [Coverture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture). In that a wife pretty much had no rights, she was controlled by her husband. \n\nBut you know what, this is /r/badhistory and I want something historical. I mean, it is easy to confuse the early 20th century and the early 16th century. Anyone could get confused which came first. No, rather I will point to something that clearly predates the 20th century, the Constitution, that predates English Common Law. How about the oldest legal code, [Code of Hammurabi](http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html). In that we find legal rules for marriage. So they are only off by about 3,600 years. \n\nedit. So, OK, I've been asked to lengthen this a bit. I can only assume it is because it was so brilliant (and not that it was lacking substance). So lets look at the Code of Hammurabi. It is the oldest legal code for which we have an actual document. The Code has a fancy prologue, an epilogue, and 282 lines of legal code. Things like:\n\n48) If any one owe a debt for a loan, and a storm prostrates the grain, or the harvest fail, or the grain does not grow for lack of water; in that year he need not give his creditor any grain, he washes his debt-tablet in water and pays no rent for this year. \n\nOK, so is marriage important in this law? Well there is:\n\n117) If any one fail to meet a claim for debt, and sell himself, his wife, his son, and daughter for money or give them away to forced labor: they shall work for three years in the house of the man who bought them, or the proprietor, and in the fourth year they shall be set free. \n\nSo that says to us that wife is something the law recognizes. (And to be clear this is something that libertarians object to.)\n\nBut wait, there's more. Rules 127 to 173, 47 rules deal with marriage in some way or another. 47 out of 282, 17% of the code deals with marriage. Marriage was not simply part of the law since forever, it has been an integral important topic handled by the law.\n\nedit 2: Turns out I was foolish. I actually believed some libertarians on history rather than checking. No,] marriage license did not start in 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_license), they were not to stop interracial marriage. Marriage license were required in MA in 1639, they were common across the country in the 19th century. Turns out there was no part of the OP original comment that was factually correct.\n\n\n",

        "text": "About a month ago I submitted a thread asking, \"[Am I a bad historian if my personal interests align with the great man theory?](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/36mqk7/am_i_a_bad_historian_if_my_personal_interests/)\" This engendered a really great discussion about the accuracy of various modes of historiography, and made me question many convictions I had previously held about the field of history and my interest in it. In this thread, I tried to verbalize my personal conflict with history by explaining that my personal tastes tended to hover toward more methodologically conservative works of literature, but I realize now that this isn't fully correct. I don't exactly prefer studying about \"great people\"; I prefer studying a narrative. I tend to think of history as \"things that happen\", and am most interested in learning history this way. I recognize the incredible importance of anthropological social history, and find it to be oftentimes very fascinating, but I prefer to learn what *happened*, not what *was*. Quite a long time ago, I insisted on another forum that \"history is about studying changes to the status quo\". While I'm now very aware that this is an immature and ignorant view of history, I'm still most interested in individual events, people, or movements that changed society. More broadly, I want to understand the narrative. \n\nMuch of my opening post dealt with a recent course by [Guido Ruggiero](http://www.as.miami.edu/history/people/faculty/guido-ruggiero/), a rather illustrious Renaissance historian who recently published (and taught) a lengthy [overview of the Renaissance and Italy](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/european-history-after-1450/renaissance-italy-social-and-cultural-history-rinascimento), which I found incredibly enlightening but also very disappointing. While I took the class mostly hoping to learn what happened in the Renaissance, the textbook was primarily a work of \"social and cultural history\". This meant that the course was almost entirely non-chronological, and was in many ways an ethnography of 14th-16th century Florentines. Every chapter was centered around a lofty concept like \"Self\", \"Discovery\", or \"Violence\" and how they ideals of the Rinascimento (the terminology that Professor Ruggiero preferred). This book covered a very wide range of topics, from attitudes toward premarital sex to the baronial organization of Rome, but never delved into the events that specifically piqued my interest.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last thread, there was very little attention given to the motivations or effects of any individual or event. The late-fifteenth century French invasion of Italy, which I might consider to be possibly the most important single event of the Italian Renaissance, was not covered. We never learned why the war was fought or how it ran its course, and Dr. Ruggiero didn't mention its implications on the politics of Italy. Instead, we learned how it reduced efficacy in the strength of the Italian states and promoted resentment against the French and the Church. Similarly, the rapid and mind-numbingly massive conquests of Gian Galeazzo Visconti were not described. Despite its 650 pages, the textbook only mentioned the Count of Milan in reference to his \"virtu\" and how he was idolized by certain Italian intellectuals for his shrewdness. Personally, I would be thrilled to read an account of Gian Galeazzo's campaigns and how they transformed the governments and erased the borders of Northern Italy. It may not be as consequential to the scope of European history in the long-term, but learning about the specifics of these wars is far more interesting to me than studying Boccaccio's views on sexual morality and whether or not they represented popular opinion (a topic that Dr. Ruggiero was especially fond of). \n\nCould there be a \"narrative history\" that contrasts with mainstream social history? Do there exist any noteworthy recent works that cover events as they happened? It seems that nearly all pre-modern works of history follow the mold I prefer, and because about 90% of the historical literature I've been assigned has been a primary source, that might explain my tastes. In an earlier semester I read the *Diary of Margaery Kemp* and *The Murder, Betrayal, and Slaughter of Charles, Count of Flanders*, two very different but equally engrossing medieval texts that described in very real terms the Middle Ages as experienced by its people. Another book assigned that semester, concerning the \"True Levellers\" of early modern England, was much more of a drag. Although it was written centuries later, it was less engrossing due to its non-narrative structure, as it carried an assumption that a student could understand the English Civil War without needing to know the events as they occurred. With some slight reservation I'll concede that I'm a pretty big fan of certain Dan Carlin podcasts. I take his material with a grain of salt, given his spotty reputation among academic historians, but the way he presents history -- a storytelling approach, emphasizing certain influential figures and particularly important or exciting events -- is really exciting and a little bit inspirational. One traditional work of \"narrative history\" that I've often seen mentioned is Robert Carlyle's *The French Revolution*, and while it sounds somewhat appealing I'm very hesitant to read it. Carlyle is obviously infamous for his reductionist outlook of history, and is essentially the mascot of the kind of intellectual childishness that I worry I may be associated with, for not preferring modern social history. Moreover, Carlyle's theories are very popular with current white supremacists, making me even more wary.\n\nCan a proper historian (or at least a proper student of history) justify a preference for narrative history, or is it deterministic and immature to perceive history as a \"collection of stories\"? Is there an ongoing struggle between social historians and narrative historians, or am I rambling about an imaginary distinction?",

They were not trying to systematically kill all bengalis but only the ones who were fighting against them and/or involved in the rebellion.\n\nOP here is not only trying to change the meaning of the word \"genocide\", but is flat-out wrong about the intentions and actions of the Pakistani army in 1971. OP actually appears to be using a tactic also used by Armenian-deniers: \"they weren't trying to wipe all of them out\".  I'm afraid I can't go into great detail here, but  the fact that there's an entire [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) page dedicated to it suggests OP might be slightly off-bat here. I've put down quotes below which I hope can build a better picture.\n\n&gt; To this extent the West began a strategy to forcibly assimilate the Bengalis culturally.\n\nThere are some definitions of the word \"genocide\" which include attempts at eroding, forcibly assimilating or destroying cultures. I don't necessarily agree, but let's leave this up here as food for thought.\n\n&gt; The first night of war on Bengalis, which is documented in telegrams from the American Consulate in Dhaka to the United States State Department, saw **indiscriminate killings** of students of Dhaka University and other civilians.\n\nBam. There we go. Not yet genocide, perhaps, but definitely fits the mood. \n\n&gt; The minorities of Bangladesh, especially the Hindus, were specific targets of the Pakistani army. There was widespread killing of Hindu males, and rapes of women. Documented incidents in which Hindus were massacred in large numbers include the Chuknagar massacre, the Jathibhanga massacre, and the Shankharipara massacre. More than 60% of the Bengali refugees who fled to India were Hindus. It is not exactly known what percentage of the people killed by the Pakistan army were Hindus, but it is safe to say it was disproportionately high. This widespread violence against Hindus was motivated by a policy to purge East Pakistan of what was seen as Hindu and Indian influences. The West Pakistani rulers identified the Bengali culture with Hindu and Indian culture, and thought that the eradication of Hindus would remove such influences from the majority Muslims in East Pakistan.\n\nHere we can explicitly see that the Pakistani establishment was especially targeting the Hindus of East Pakistan ***for eradication***. Isn't another common definition of genocide one where people of a particular ethnic or religious community are targeted? Once again, OP's claim that it wasn't a genocide weakens. Bonus: more cultural cleansing. \n\n&gt; The genocide and gendercidal atrocities were also perpetrated by lower-ranking officers and ordinary soldiers. These \"willing executioners\" were fueled by an abiding anti-Bengali racism, especially against the Hindu minority. \"Bengalis were often compared with monkeys and chickens. Said General Niazi, 'It was a low lying land of low lying people.' The Hindus among the Bengalis were as Jews to the Nazis: scum and vermin that [should] best be exterminated. As to the Moslem Bengalis, they were to live only on the sufferance of the soldiers: any infraction, any suspicion cast on them, any need for reprisal, could mean their death. And the soldiers were free to kill at will. The journalist Dan Coggin quoted one Pakistani captain as telling him, \"We can kill anyone for anything. We are accountable to no one.\"\n\nOP later implies that soldiers of the Pakistani army couldn't have taken a \"collective vow of silence\", and he's right - but only because several Pakistani soldiers themselves have attested to the atrocities that were perpetrated against the bengali population.\n\nBonus:\n\n&gt; There were millions of refugees who fled the violence in Afghanistan during the 80s. Does this mean that there was a genocide going on in Afghanistan in the 80s ?\n\n&gt;The US Army killed non-combatants during the MyLai massacre. Does this mean that they were committing a genocide in Vietnam ? Clearly, the answer is no.\n\n[mfw](http://media3.giphy.com/media/cQtlhD48EG0SY/giphy.gif)\n\nReading about stuff my family members barely escaped from triggers me, seeing people act as if it was insignificant truly does something else. Oh well, I hope I can relieve you guys of your usual wehraboo suffering with some 1971 denial!",

        "text": "June 17, 2015, a violent racist committed an act of terrorism in Charleston, South Carolina, cutting down ten black members of the congregation. Revelations of his worship of the Confederacy has reinvigorated discussion of the proper legacy of that bygone institution, and most importantly, its legacy of racism. There has been no lack of vocal, and often offensive, attempts to defend the Confederacy in one way or another, both here on reddit and in other media. I won't be focusing on any specific one, and rather be speaking generally. Nor will I be tackling the entirety of the \"Lost Cause\", an undertaking that would cover a far larger scope than can be dealt with in a short essay such as this. The purpose of this piece is solely to look at the causes of the American Civil War, and apologist claims regarding whether the South seceded over slavery, whether states' rights justified it, and whether the North cared about slavery as well.\n\n-----\n\n&gt;[I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.](http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html)\n\n-Abe Lincoln's First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861\n\nIt is a canard of Confederate apologia that war aims must be perfectly opposite. It is simply a fact that in his public statements, President Lincoln made clear that he was not out to abolish slavery, and that the Union undertook its campaign to prevent southern secession, since, in his words, the Union was perpetual, that \"Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments\". So, their logic goes however, that if the Union did not launch its war to end slavery, then slavery was not the cause of the war. Nothing could be further from the truth. This work will attack this position from multiple angles, demonstrating not only that the protection of slavery was a principal aim of southern secession, but that the mere right to secede was never a clearly established legal one, at best subject to major debate, and indeed, only entering the national discussion as slavery became a more and more divisive issue for the young nation, and further, that aside from legal/Constitutional concerns, secession as performed by the South was an immoral and illiberal act.\n\n----\n\n&gt;Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"to form a more perfect Union.\"\n\n-Abe Lincoln, March 4, 1861\n\nThe idea, often pithily expressed by the factoid of \"The United States *are* vs. The United States *is*\", that as originally envisioned the several states were essentially independent nations held together by a weak Federal entity for the common defense, and that it was the Civil War which changed this relationship, is an utterly false one. While Lincoln is perhaps a biased figure to appeal to, his observation nevertheless points to the sentiments of the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution that followed, which speak of perpetuity and union at the time of founding.\n\nAt the time of drafting, James Madison, the \"father\" of the Constitution, noted in a letter to Alexander Hamilton that [\"the Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever\", because \"compacts must be reciprocal\"](http://www.constitution.org/jm/17880720_hamilton.txt). Likewise, while reading out the letter to the New York Ratification Convention, Hamilton expressed similar sentiment in response, that [\"a reservation of a right to withdraw […] was inconsistent with the Constitution, and was no ratification.\"](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-05-02-0012-0099) Similarly, Washington, serving as President of the Constitutional Convention, noted \"In all our deliberations on this subject [the perpetuity of the government] we kept constantly in our view that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence\".^1 While it is certainly true that the Constitution made no explicit mention either way as to the correctness of secession, and that some expressed trepidation at the thought secession could not be an option, it is equally true that the issue was addressed at the time of ratification, and it was anti-secession Federalists such as Hamilton and Madison, with clarity of their position, who shepherded it through.^2\n\nBut if secession was not a clearly reserved right from the beginning, when did it begin to enter the \"conversation\"? Well, the fact of the matter is that the importance of the aforementioned perspective is itself a product of the post-war revisionist works. It is misleading at best to speak of state loyalties above country and in fact, it is demonstrable that it was the supremacy of *national* loyalties that helped to delay the divisiveness of slavery that started to nose itself into the national conscious with the 1819 Missouri Crisis^3a. Rather than being an inherent weakness of the Federal government as created by the Constitution, the apparent weakness of the Federal government was a creation of southern politicians specifically working to protect their slavery based interests from the mid-to-late 1820s on-wards, forcing compromises that maintained a balance between slave and free states. To quote Donald Ratcliffe:\n\n&gt;The strengthening of national power in the 1860s reflected, in part, the restoration of the political situation that had existed before the South began to impose its deadening hand on the Union in the thirty years before the war.^3a\n\nNow, while demonstrating that the doctrine of states' rights was not a constant over the first 80 years of United States politics, it still stands to show that, far from being a \"flavor of the month\", as some 'lesser' apologists assert, slavery was an absolute central component of Confederate war aims, and the defense of their 'peculiar institution' surpassed any principled defense of States' Rights. The simple fact of the matter is, that far from simply asserting their moral right to own another human being for the use of their labor, the southern states' need for slaves was intimately tied to their political and economic fortunes, to the point that any claim of political or economic reasons for secession can not be separated from the root base of slavery.\n\nWhen Lincoln was elected in the fall of 1860, the South was terrified. Whatever his prior declarations that whether he wished to or not, he had no power to interfere with the institution where it existed, Lincoln was nevertheless a Republican, a political party founded on its opposition to slavery, and at its most mild, committed to stemming the further spread as statehood spread westward. While committed, absolute abolitionism was a vocal minority on the national stage, the simple limiting of expansion presented a long term existential crisis to the slaveholding states. Every free state to enter the Union represented additional Senators and Representatives to immediately exercise power in Congress, and represented the growth of power not only in future Presidential elections, where anti-slavery parties could continue to gain momentum, but in the long term even foreshadowed, one day, a strong enough majority to abolish the institution once and for all through Constitutional Amendment. And it wasn't only that Lincoln and the speedy rise of the Republican party threatened a political threat to slavery, but also that, due to the 3/5 Compromise, the existence of enslaved populations represented a significant boost to the electoral power of the slave states.^3b\n\nEconomically, the fortunes and viability of the South were intertwined with slavery so closely as to be inseparable. Turning to the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s, Calhoun observed that slavery was the undercurrent of economic disagreements with the northern states, although he was by no means the first or last:\n\n&gt;I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestic institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.\n\nWhile fears over the continued viability slavery had been a driving concern for southern politicians for at least a decade by then, it was the Nullification Crisis that clearly established the unbreakable ties of slavery and economic concerns. To quote Richard Latner:\n\n&gt;South Carolina's protest against the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 was only a surface manifestation of profound planter fears, real and imaginary, that a hostile northern majority would subvert their slave system. The crisis laid bare southern anxieties about maintaining slavery and evidenced a determination to devise barriers against encroachments on southern rights.^4\n\nOver the next several decades, the divisiveness of slavery would continue to smolder and widen, even as compromises continued to be made. It was slavery driving the divisions above all else, and arguments of slavery that continued to drive Southern movement towards breaking part of the Union.\n\nBeginning with Vermont in 1850, and soon followed by many of her northern neighbors over the next several years, free states began passing laws to prevent compliance with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The reactions from the South to these acts were not sparing in their condemnation of states exercising their rights against the Federal Government. Papers throughout the South decried the \"nullification\" and threatened responses of their own, such as in the case of one Richmond paper declaring:\n\n&gt;When it becomes apparent that [the Fugitive Slave Law's] operation is practically nullified by the people of one or more States, differences of opinion may arise as to the proper remedy, but one thing is certain that some ample mode of redress will be chosen, in which the South with entire unanimity will concur.^5\n\nThe refusal of Northern states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Laws remained a sticking point throughout the decade, as did the thinly veiled threats by southern states that they might very well secede over the issue (A tit-for-tat, perhaps, but nevertheless demonstrative of the centrality of slavery to their grievances). The first example came with the December, 1850 convention held in Georgia, where they accepted the Compromise of 1850 in what was known as the [Georgia Platform](http://blueandgraytrail.com/event/Georgia_Platform). The integrity of the Fugitive Slave Act was one of the key factors (along with slavery in DC, and maintaining the interstate slave trade), and there is a barely disguised threat of secession included in the statement released by the convention. The Georgia Platform was de facto adopted as the platform of the Southern Democrats, perhaps culminating, in February, 1860, with then Senator [Jeff Davis's resolution](https://jeffersondavis.rice.edu/Content.aspx?id=81) that included the statement that refusal of certain states to enforce the act would \"sooner or later lead the States injured by such breach of the compact to exercise their judgment as to the proper mode and measure of redress.\"^6\n\nWhether or not the south appreciated the Irony that they were threatening secession *because* certain states were attempting to exercise \"states' rights\", is unclear, but what is clear is that, as Dr. James McPherson put it:\n\n&gt;On all issues but one, antebellum southerners stood for state's rights and a weak federal government. The exception was the fugitive slave law of 1850, which gave the national government more power than any other law yet passed by Congress.^7\n\nWhich now brings us to 1860. Within only days of Lincoln's election, South Carolina made to leave the Union, a process completed before the year was out. Although claiming secession to be their right, the acceptance of their platform is, as noted previously, an inflated one by post-war revisionists, and even ignoring that, a thoroughly illiberal and immoral abrogating of democratic principles. As Madison, in his old age, put it to Daniel Webster, [\"[Secession at will] answers itself, being a violation, without cause, of a faith solemnly pledged,\"](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch3s14.html) or in more immediate terms, participation in the system is a pledge to abide by it. In 1860, even if they refused to even list him on the ballot, in participating in the Presidential election, the South made implicit promise to accept the results. While we have already explored the mixed opinions on secession upon the foundation of the country, this presents another, albeit minor, nail in the southern claims to righteousness. To return to the earlier point, it is true, as certain Neo-Confederate apologists like to cloud the waters with:\n\n&gt;The South did not secede to protect slavery from a national plan of emancipation because no national political party proposed emancipation^8\n\nBut such claim is not one that an reasonable historian would make. The simple fact is, that decades of debate and action demonstrated the undercurrent of slavery moving towards this moment, and that despite Lincoln's protests that he had no inclination, the Southern planter class simply did not believe him, and whether or not a specific platform of emancipation had been put forward, the simple fact is that they chose to secede following Lincoln's election, over the issue of slavery. Whether you view it through the thoroughly practical lens as an economic and political issue, rather than a moral one - although the fire-eaters made no qualms of declaring their moral right, it cannot change the simple facts [which their own words so clearly express](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html):\n\n* Mississippi:\n\n&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\n\n* Texas:\n\n&gt;Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?\n\n* South Carolina\n\n&gt;The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.\n\n* Georgia\n\n&gt;The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.\n\nAnd lest the clear ties of secession and slavery are not demonstrated through these declarations, the fire-eating Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens eloquently noted:\n\n&gt;[The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution — African slavery as it exists amongst us — the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization\" and further that \"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea [\"equality of the races\"]; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech)\n\nThe words that came from the Confederate Founding Fathers over the next several months only further illustrate the importance of slavery over any cares for states' rights. [Copying almost wholesale the American Constitution for their own purposes, some of the most jarring changes were those that not only strengthened the institution of slavery, but further more quite possibly did so at the expense of the states' rights](http://www.jjmccullough.com/CSA.htm). In Article I, Sec. 9(4) it declares:\n\n&gt;No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.\n\nThis is further reinforces with Article 4, Sec. 2(1) which goes on with:\n\n&gt;The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.\n\nFinally, the right is again solidified with Article 4, Sec. 3(3):\n\n&gt;The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several Sates [sic]; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form States to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States.\n\nNow, it is true that the secession of the latter Confederate states can be construed as less straight-forward. There is no real need here to play \"What If\" as to whether Virginia or Tennessee could have been kept within the Union, or whether Missouri of Kentucky could have been prevented from splintering both ways. Their declarations/ordinances of secession make less pleas towards slavery specifically, and point as well to solidarity with the earlier breakaways, but to take their lessened language as a symbol that, unlike their Deep Southern partners, these Upper Southern states *were* acting out of principled support for their brethren is erroneous, least of all given that it was the Upper South whose papers and politicians were more vocal than most when it came to decrying Northern 'perfidy' with regards to the fugitive slave act. The stakes of slavery were made well aware to them, and they acted knowing full-well what they were leaving the Union to protect. Speaking to the Virginians assembled to discuss the issue of secession, the fire-eater Henry Benning of Georgia gave listeners no doubts as to the cause and motivations of secession:\n\n&gt;[[The reason] was a conviction, a deep conviction on the part of Georgia, that a separation from the North-was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of her slavery. [....] [T]hat the North is in the course of acquiring this power to abolish slavery.](http://civilwarcauses.org/benningva.htm)\n\nPlaying on their concerns regarding the Fugitive Slave Laws, he went on further to assert that the North acted not out of any love of the enslaved population, but out of hatred of the slave owners, and that, having left the Union, the North would no longer shelter runaways, and, as \"the North will be no attraction to the black man-no attraction to the slaves\", escapes northward would lessen.\n\nThe plain truth of the words laid out here speak for themselves, but the blood of 800,000 dead Americans had barely dried when the very fire-eaters who had previously crowed that the foundations of the Confederacy were built on slavery and white supremacy began one of the most successful whitewashes of history. One of the very first authors to spearhead the revision secession and give birth to the \"Lost Cause\" was Alexander Stephens, although he would be by no means the only. Not even a decade after calling slavery the 'Cornerstone of the Confederacy', he wrote [\"A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States\"](https://archive.org/details/constitutionalvi00lcstep) in which he argues forcefully in favor of States' Rights, and further that slavery was a minor concern. This foundational text of Confederate apologia would soon be followed in 1881 by Jefferson Davis's similar work, [\"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\"](https://archive.org/details/riseandfallconf01davigoog), alternatively called a book of “legalistic and constitutional apologetics”, or more simply, \"terrible\".^3c The \"Lost Cause\", as the revisionist approach to the Confederacy came to be known, was as much a political doctrine as anything else, and orthodoxy was enforced. Longstreet's willingness to make not just bury the hatchet, but work with Republicans in the post-war period saw him come to be blamed for many of Lee's failures, such as at Gettysburg, and although a war hero as well, William Mahone served only a single term as Senator for Virginia when he chose to work with Republicans and the Readjusters.^9 The failure of Reconstruction, and return to political office of the white Democrats who had so recently risen up in rebellion merely allowed entrenchment and further perpetuating of the Lost Cause mythos, to the point that by the early 20th century it dominated the national conscious, despite being grounded in myth more than reality.^10\n\nHereto now, I have focused almost entirely on the Southern causes of war, and I hope, have adequately demonstrated a) The central, vital nature of slavery to the cause of secession, to the point that no other issue can be conceived as being able to so divide the nation; b) That ignoring slavery, the South did not act out of a correct, abstract principle of states' rights, but rather what at best can be called murky Constitutional grounds; c) And finally the root of the arguments in favor of the aforementioned positions can be traced to the very people who had the most vested interest in presenting the cause as noble, yet at its start had made clear the importance of slavery to their cause.\n\nWhat I have not yet touched on except in brief is the Union, and specifically how slavery plays into their own cause. As pointed out, a key point of southern apologia is that the Union did not go to war to end slavery, and again, while not negating the fact that the South left to protect it, this much is, essentially, true. While campaigning, however much he might have privately detested slavery, Lincoln had no plans - expressed publicly or privately - to raise an Army and march south to end slavery once elected. Upon his inauguration, faced with a crumbling nation, his plea for unity impressed the point that he had no inclination to do so. As late as 1862, even while planning the Emancipation Proclamation, he wrote to Horace Greeley:\n\n&gt;[If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about Slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union, and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.](http://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/24/news/letter-president-lincoln-reply-horace-greeley-slavery-union-restoration-union.html)\n\nA month after, on the tail of victory at Antietam creek, he would release the [\"Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation\"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Emancipation_Proclamation), essentially a warning to the south that, were they to continue in their rebellion, he would make slavery a direct aim of the war, but were they to rejoin the Union prior, he would not end it for them. While, by this point, Lincoln had begun to commit privately to ending slavery one way or the other, he believed that Compensated Emancipation would cost far less, both in lives and monetary value, than the war would, and was prepared to put it into action. Although the South, of course, rejected the offer, movement was made to do so with the loyal states, but in the end only the slave owners of the District of Columbia were compensated, since after a failed attempt in Delaware, the idea was scrapped.^11\n\nBut we digress. On January 1st, 1863, the abolition of slavery became a stated goal of the war. Except for according to some, who point out that Lincoln freed no slaves in the north with his act, which in fact was a PR ploy, aimed simply to prevent Britain from making nice with the Confederacy. The claim is false on both aspects. As far as Lincoln's power to free the slaves was concerned, as he himself had stated, he did not believe himself to have those powers, nationally. He believed himself to only have the power to free the slaves in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, where he wielded unrivaled power over the very areas he did not control - those in rebellion. In issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln believed himself to be exercising as much power as he was capable off as regards the slaves, and to free them in the loyal states, even ignoring the fact that to do so by fiat would incur their wrath, he needed the assent of their legislatures. He worked for much of the war to secure the end of slavery, *through legal means*, in the north, first with the failed bid for compensated emancipation, and then through the 13th Amendment, which began to work its way through Congress, for the eventual ratification by the states, in early 1864.^12\n\nTo be sure, not everyone was pleased. While some soldiers had, from the start, seen the war as a noble crusade to end slavery, plenty more were committed to the preservation of the Union. The establishment of emancipation as a declared war aim was met with both praise and censure. Most famous of the latter, perhaps, were the New York Draft Riots. Contemptuous of black liberation, which they saw as a threat to the labor market, potentially undercutting them for lower wages, the poor, mainly Irish and German immigrant population of New York City took a dim view of Emancipation, a fear that Democratic forces in the city did their best to stoke. With the expansion of the draft laws in spring of 1863 matters had nearly reached their crescendo, and the boiling point finally came in July, with five days of anti-draft and anti-black riots, eventually requiring the use of troops to put down, but not before over 100 people lay (or hung) dead, and thousands of free blacks had fled the city in terror. However terrible the incident was however - and it was not the only protest against the draft and the \"N***** War\", only the most violent - it does little to change the facts, and if anything, simply serves to illustrate that Emancipation had been unleashed as a committed goal by the Union, not merely an empty slogan.^13, ^7\n\nAs for the British, the chance of *armed* intervention was always next to none, and even the threat of diplomatic intervention is a highly overblown one. While support for the Confederacy was fashionable in upper-class circles for a time^11, it never extended into the middle or lower classes, where support was near universal for the Union even before the Emancipation Proclamation, which, to be sure, only spurred their support even further given the deep hatred of slavery that so many of them held. [While the letter from the Manchester Working Men and Lincoln's reply is perhaps the most famous example](http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham), it is a sentiment that could be found throughout the country, even in the heart of the industry suffering from cotton shortages. With regards to support for the South, slavery was an \"insurmountable stumbling block\" from the very beginning of the war.^14 And as dire as concerns were bout the impending cotton famine, in reality, they were overblown. Imports from other regions more than doubled, making up for much of the shortage, and several organizations found jobs for out-of-work mill-workers constructing public works such as roads and bridges. Far more dire than cotton shortages were those of food. Britain experienced a string of bad harvests in the 1860s, making it highly dependent on imports (wheat more than doubled from 1859 to 1862), and none more so than the United States, which, despite the ongoing conflict, had a nice surplus, allowing them not only to increase their exports to Britain several times over, but more importantly, the volume of American imports were nearly equal to all other import sources combined^15, ^7 . The level of dependency was enormous, and a far more vital import than cotton, especially in light of the remedies for the lack of the latter.\n\nSo in short, the threat of British intervention, while cherished by the South, and grimly contemplated from time-to-time by Seward, was a remote one, tempered the least by practical concerns, and more generally by political ones. While showing the world the righteousness of his cause was indeed happy by product of the Emancipation Proclamation, to see in it simply an appeal to the British is to not only skip over Lincoln's legal reach, but also to ignore how generally supportive the British people were from the start, even taking into consideration the private enterprises who evaded the law to supply the Confederacy with ships and arms.\n\nEmancipation brings us, however, to one final quirk of Confederate apologia, which is perhaps one of the stranger. It is not uncommon to hear claims that slavery was on the way out, and that the South would have abolished it on its own in due time, or even that they were already planning on doing so (obviously, as part of the argument that slavery wasn't important to them).\n\nAt its most basic, such claims fly in the face of reality, not only the words of the slave holders who had proclaimed their rights, and duties even, to hold enslaved Africans, and not even the Confederate Constitution, which enshrined protections of the institution that would only be surmountable by Amendment, and one clearly opposed to the spirit of the Confederacy at that, but it also is a claim without more than the barest scrap of evidence. In fact, what evidence we do have, if anything, points to the desire to further expand slavery south to ensure its survival, with Southern-driven plans to claim Cuba, or filibuster expeditions in Central America. As noted by Allan Nevis:\n\n&gt;The South, as a whole, in 1846-1861 was not moving towards emancipation but away from it. It was not relaxing the laws that guarded the system but reinforcing them. It was not ameliorating slavery, but making it harsher and more implacable. The South was further from a just solution to the slavery problem in 1830 than in 1789. It was further from a tenable solution in 1860 than in 1830.^10\n\nThe one piece of evidence that is dragged out is the claim that the Confederate Army fielded black soldiers, with some claims rising into the thousands.^16 While it is undoubtedly true that tens of thousands of enslaved black men were utilized in the Confederate war effort, they labored as cooks, teamsters, or body-servants. Reports of these slaves picking up arms and fighting the Union, while not to be totally dismissed as fantasy, ought also not be accepted as motions of support. To quote from one representative example related by John Stauffer: \n\n&gt;John Parker, [was] a slave forced to build Confederate barricades and later to join the crew of a cannon firing grapeshot at Union troops at the First Battle of Bull Run. All the while, recalled Parker, he worried about dying, prayed for a Union victory, and dreamed of escaping to the other side. “His case can be seen as representative,” said Stauffer. “Masters put guns to (the heads of slaves) to make them shoot Yankees.\"^17\n\nIn the waning days of the Confederacy, the Barksdale Bill was passed on March 13, 1865. The bill allowed for the enlistment of black slaves for service in the Confederacy, but required the permission of their master, and left whether they could be emancipated for their service ultimately in the hands of their master rather the guaranteeing it by law.^18, ^11 Far from being symbolic of any actual movement towards emancipation, or evidence that slavery was less than a core value of the Confederacy, the law should be viewed as nothing more than a desperate measure by the Confederate leadership who knew just how close to defeat they were. Even considering their situation, the measure was far from universally supported. The fire-eater Robert Toombs decried the bill, declaring that “the day that the army of Virginia allows a negro regiment to enter their lines as soldiers they will be degraded, ruined, and disgraced.”^11 The distaste for such an act was strong with many more, and it was only the truly dire straits that saw passage of the bill. A year prior, Gen. Patrick Cleburne had suggested a similar motion, seeing slaves not only as source of manpower, but daring to suggest that emancipation could *help* the Confederacy:\n\n&gt;[It is said that slavery is all we are fighting for, and if we give it up we give up all. Even if this were true, which we deny, slavery is not all our enemies are fighting for. It is merely the pretense to establish sectional superiority and a more centralized form of government, and to deprive us of our rights and liberties.](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/patrick-r-cleburne-et-al.html)\n\nHis proposal, flying in the face of Confederate opinion and policy, was utterly ignored, and almost certainly derailed his career as well, since, despite his obvious talents, he received no further promotion before his death in November, 1864. \n\nAs noted, even when the idea of black soldiers had enough support, it still fell far short of Cleburne's proposal, which, if taken at face value, truly could have stood to change the relationship between the Confederacy and slavery, and instead offered a watered down measure that didn't even give absolute guarantee for those slaves who served as soldiers. And in part due to this, partly due to masters unwilling to part with their property, and in no small part due to unwillingness on the part of the slaves themselves who know freedom was only around the corner, the law failed to have any effect. Barely a handful of recruits ever reported for training, and they would never see action, as Richmond fell two months later, with the erstwhile recruits enthusiastically greeting the Yankees along with the rest of the now freed black population.^11\n\nOutside of the Barksdale Bill and Cleburne, motion to enlist black soldiers did rear its head on one instance. Free people of color and mulattoes enjoyed a much greater degree of acceptance and freedom in New Orleans than elsewhere in the south, and a 1,000 man unit was raised there at the onset of the war, known as the Louisiana Native Guard, composed entirely of free blacks and mulattoes, barring the regimental commanders. While *more* accepted in New Orleans, the Native Guard still faced considerable discrimination, never even being issued with arms or uniforms, forcing them to provision on their own dime. New Orleans fell in early 1862, and, having never seen action, the shaky loyalties of the Native Guard was made evident when many of their number soon were dressed in Union blue with the reformation of the Native Guard under Yankee control.^19, ^20\n\n----\n\nAnd that is, the sum of it all. The South undeniably seceded over the issue of slavery. Their words and actions cry it from the rooftops. Lincoln, while entering the war to preserve the perpetual union of the states, never had slavery far from his mind. It was that fact which drove secession, and it was the splintering of the nation that allowed Lincoln's anti-slavery to transition from personal conviction into a policy of emancipation as the war dragged on. Less than a year after the first shot was fired upon Fort Sumter, Lincoln was contemplating how he could bring about the end of slavery, and by the next, he had made his move, ensuring the eventual destruction of the South's peculiar institution. While the accepted history of the war for many decades following lionized the \"Lost Cause\" of the south, and romanticized the conflict, all to downplay the base values of the Confederacy, that narrative is nothing more than a legend, a falsehood, and in recent decades has, rightfully, been eclipsed by a revitalization of scholarship that has returned slavery to its rightful place in the history of the American Civil War.\n\n----\n\nBibliography:\n\nPrimary sources are linked here for context.

I'm not a historian, but I am a Southerner and I can say that the racial caste system that slavery created is something that still exists in vestigial form in the American South to this very day. When Neo-Confederates say that the Civil War was fought to preserve Southern culture they aren't wrong, but they are conveniently neglecting to mention that Southern culture by the time of the Civil War has been completely shaped by centuries of dependency on the institution of slavery. Slavery was such a central part of Southern culture that I find it hard to believe that we would have ever gotten rid of it without being forced to. Hell, we basically didn't in some forms straight up to World War II, and the modern Prison Industrial Complex contains shades of the same methods by which black people were kept in conditions of unfreedom in the post Civil War period right to this day.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the slaveholding aristocracy of the South was determined not only to preserve slavery but to expand it and I don't think it's a given at all that black Southerners would not still be held in some form of legal unfreedom to this very day without federal intervention.",

        "text": "Unlike /u/Benardito or /u/Samuel_I I have never actually seen *Deadliest Warrior*, although I do remember seeing commercials for it, so really this will be an adventure for all of us. Looking through the various episodes the results seem largely predetermined by a mix of red blooded American politics and bro history: why exactly can an IRA hit squad take on the Taliban? How can Washington defeat Napoleon? What makes the French musketeers better than the Jinyiwei? Who on earth thought of pitting Apaches and gladiators together? I can't answer the last one, but for the other ones a basic familiarity with pop culture and the stereotypical Spike TV audience's political bias will give a good answer.\n\nWhich brings us to Centurion vs. Rajput, which I chose in part because I honestly could not have predicted who would win: does the bro history of mystical Indian warrior outdo the politics of awesome Rome (yes, as it turns out)? The other reason I did it was because the match is, on its face and everywhere really, completely absurd. This is not pirate vs. ninja, this is pirate vs. astronaut. Roman centurion was a rank without any indication of personal combat prowess. They were the staff sergeants of the Roman army. The Rajput, on the other hand, were the *kshatriya* aristocrats of northwest India, who incorporated Turkic, Gangetic and indigenous values and techniques into their martial social code to become feared warriors who earned the fear of the Mughals and respect of the British. Or in other words, you have a guy who is mostly valued due to his skills as a disciplinarian against someone raised from birth to be a valorous warrior. It's a bit silly.\n\nSo I guess to start this charade off, I'll give an initial pedantry point: The narrator claims on one side the centurions who were the commanders of the world's first professional army. While the professionalism and dominance of the Roman army was in many ways unprecedented, they were not the first professional army: at the very least they were proceeded by the Macedonians, but you could probably make a pretty good argument fir the Assyrians as the first. For the Rajput, the date given is 900 CE, which isn't *bad* per se but is kind of weird as they were mostly famous for their fights against the Turks an Mughals. But hey, we have simulations!\n\nSo now we have a little introductory bit. The centurion is primarily characterized within the success of the Roman military, which makes sense but kind of raises the question of why they are being singled out as individual warriors. Also, lots of epic music. The rajput characterization is...odd? They seem to be putting a lot of stake on “weird” weapons like the chakram (which is mainly a Sikh thing what they hey) when really they mainly used scimitars. But whatevs. \n\nIn describing a punching dagger one of the people said “when your hand becomes steel, there is nothing you can't punch”. This is poetry.\n\nSpeaking of poetry, following introductions the rajput reenactor using the punching dagger to punch stab a pig carcass. They have helpfully loaded the pig carcass with what appears to be fake blood, or at least cranberry juice, so when the dead pig is punch stabbed it gives a comical waterfall of blood. What does this prove? I have no idea. Poetry.\n\nI suppose I am obligated to give a minor critique that the entire test (in which they put chainmail over a pg carcass and then punch stab it) is absurd. Armor that is light enough to be worn is not designed to stop direct punch stabbing. It's basically impossible, as the full force of the punch stab is concentrated on the tip of the punch stab. It also doesn't really replicate a battlefield situation, unless the Romans adopted the novel tactic of swinging from a tree to accept death at the hands of punch stabs.\n\nBut again, this is poetry. Poetry does not obey conscious reason, it obeys a higher calling. In this case, punch stabbing.\n\nAs this pattern weaves, however, it takes a strange shape, that of the ascribed Roman arsenal: The gladius, pilum, dolabrum and scorpion. It is worth noting that none of these, strictly speaking, were in the arsenal of the centurion who, and I cannot stress this enough, was not an individual warrior but rather an officer who organized bodies of men. The centurion primarily carried a *vitis*, or staff that was used for, you will not be surprised, commanding men.\n\nInstead of that, however, the centurion is given a *dolabra*, which is a mattock. In that the Roman army's logistical and engineering capability was absolutely unparalleled the *dolabra* is indeed a fitting symbol of its prowess. But as a weapon it is about as good as a mattock. Which it was. Used for digging trenches and chopping down doors.\n\nThe poetry returns as the mattock is used to stab a fake body. As it turns out, a full swing with a mattock will indeed pierce the skin. There is a medical professional on hand to verify that the fake body, were it a real body being stabbed at full force with a mattock, would be dead. This is what we call a “poetic truth”.\n\nThese truths continue as the wise man, great sage, apparently real doctor declares that a sword that can cut through a cow's chest can also cut through a human's. Bone and bone, flesh and flesh, though we build cities and walls we remain creatures of the earth, approaching death, faced with our own mortality. The sword swings, the cow is cut, but the cow is a man not in fact but in truth.\n\nWhat follows is the chakram, flashing ring, and scorpion, terrible machine. Linked not by reason, knowledge or thought, standing like a proud warrior against the tyranny of logic, the segment soldiers on. The chakram wins, the artillery piece with no connection to personal combat falls.\n\nIn the next round, a sword whip things goes against a pilum. One might ask why the pilum is not pared with the chakram. Foolish boy, to ask such a thing! To ask is a declaration of ignorance, and it is meet that the ignorant remain silent.\n\nIn the end, nothing left but the contest of weapons, as two apparently grown men, one in a spectacularly fake beard yell and hit each other for a bit. The rajput victorious, centurion slain, but is not the victor truly us, who saw apparently grown men trash taking each other about swords? Or is this but mist, the illusions of the mad mind, to think oneself the victor in such a match? In truth, as the poet says:\n\n&gt;When your hand becomes steel, there is nothing you can't punch.",

He attempts to make peace with the US but is [given the cold shoulder.](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/castro-visits-the-united-states) President Eisenhower holed up at a golf course to avoid meeting with Castro, and VP Nixon accused Castro of being \"naive\" about Communism.\n\n1960-January 1961: Relations sour [between the two countries.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/02/20/us-cuba-castro-chronology-idUSN1922589220080220) Eisenhower launches the first phase of the embargo in [1960.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba#History) To this day, Cuba is the only country considered an [\"enemy\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917) of the US under federal law. **Cuba remains officially non-Communist until after the Bay of Pigs and doesn't formally align with Moscow until late 1962.**\n\nEarly 1961: In reaction to said embargo and the disastrous [Bay of Pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba#History) invasion, Cuba first declares a Marxist government. \n\nDecember 1961: [Castro proclaims himself a Marxist-Leninist.](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/castro-declares-himself-a-marxist-leninist) Up until this point, he was anti-American and anti-embargo but not formally a Communist.\n\n1962: [Cuba formally aligns with the USSR, accepting Soviet nukes as a counterbalance against NATO weaponry in Turkey.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anadyr) Castro had initially been resilient to formally join the Soviet bloc but was [in time persuaded by an appeal to his shared anti-Americanism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis#cite_ref-10) Cuba soon declares a single-party Communist state.\n\nTL;DR: Castro's Communist leanings were not obvious until December 1961. It is not Papa Rubio's fault that he stayed in Cuba until then.",

        "author": "Katteklo",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3bgg4j/askreddit_tells_us_about_vlad_the_impaler_and_how/",
        "text": "As it says in the bible: Ask and ye shall receive. And as askreddit has asked a question about history, bad history has been received. This is the comment in question, however I will also mention some of the replies and why those as well is bad history; http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3be5qk/what_was_the_biggest_bluff_in_history/cslecoy\n\nThe bad history in this case is about Vlad Tepes, a leader of Wallachia during periods of the 1400s, who is also known as Vlad the Impaler or Dracula. Despite what was shown in the movie Dracula Untold, which I at first thought was a documentary due to its incredible realism, he was not a vampire with superpowers. He was, however, a rather sadistic leader with a tendency to impale both enemies and his own people on stakes. And this is where the bad history shows itself. \n\nThe comment:\n &gt;Did anyone mention Vlad Dracula? Despite only having a relatively small army, by using psychological warfare, he was able to fend off or avoid war with the ottoman empire.\n\nThe claim that Vlad was able to fend off or avoid war with the ottomans is just simply not true. I'm guessing what the comment is referring to is the might be true/might be false story about Mehmet II leaving after gazing upon thousands of people that had been impaled on stakes near the wallachian capital. Wallachia was already at war with the ottomans at the time, so in no way did the impalements \"avoid war.\" Neither did it \"Fend off\" the ottomans. If the story is true, only Mehmet II  and some of his entourage went back. His army certainly didn't, nor the military leaders. \n\nOP then edits his post to explain what he meant, adding some more bad history into the mix:\n &gt;Edit: I say psychological warfare because even though he did defeat some enemies, he bluffed the ottoman empire by lining a field with spiked enemies, making it appear that vlad was more dangerous then he actually was, when in fact he was greatly outnumbered and if the ottomans weren't so thrown off by the display, they probably would have wiped vlad and his people off.\n\nAs correctly stated by OP, Vlad did defeat  ottomans in combat in several battles. Vlad was a pretty talented military leader. He utilized night ambushes and small skirmishes excellently. However, when op claims that Vlad would've been \"wiped\" by the ottomans if they hadn't been so thrown off by the sight, he forgot to mention that Vlad ultimately did die in battle against the ottomans, and that they turned Wallachia into a vassal state yet again.  (Although note that there is different claims to how he died, some says he got killed by accident from a friendly soldier etc.) \n\nOP isn't the worst offender here though. That comes from a reply further down the chain where it's claimed that Vlad:\n &gt;Protected his people and is well remembered by them .Probably saved Europe from being conquered. SO you know I wouldn't say one fo (sic) the most evil men to ever live, no.\n\nLet's begin with the \"probably saved Europe from being conquered.\" I'm kinda unsure what he means here. Does he mean that if it wasn't for Vlad the whole of Europe would get conquered? Like, all of it? Even Estonia? Nobody wanted to conquer Estonia, surely? It's Estonia! Also the ottomans took large parts of eastern Europe during 1400s and 1500s, they stretched all the way up to Vienna. So they had already conquered substantial parts of Europe. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, they did defeat Vlad, and made Wallachia a vassal state. The ottomans were stopped twice at Vienna, in 1529 and in 1683, during a time which Vlad was kinda dead. So he probably didn't have that much to do with their defeat. If anyone stopped the ottomans from \"probably conquering Europe\", it was the Holy Roman Empire. Vlad did however slow down the expansion for a period of years, and halted the ottoman expansion towards the states and territories that are now Italy as the Italian states could reinforce and prepare while the ottomans fought rebellions. \n\nThe same commenter also paints Vlad as a non-aggressor, while the ottomans are painted as warmongers. He/she writes:\n&gt;He defended his people from an Empire who wished to explicitly conquer his country.\n\nand\n\n&gt;And they were aggressors. Vald did not invade, he was invaded.\n\nThose quotes are part of rebuttals to people who claims that Vlad was \"evil\". Let's take the first one where he claims that the ottomans wanted to\"explicitly conquer his country.\" Which is not true. They wanted Wallachia to pay them tribute. The ottomans had supported Vlad Tepes' fathers claim to the throne and given him support in return of him promising to pay tribute to the empire. When Vlad Tepes later took the throne after his father had passed away, he refused to pay tribute. The ottoman empire sent some envoys to request payment, but these were killed. They then sent a small army to take care of him, but it was vanquished in an ambush by Vlad. Vlad then went on to cross the river Danube and attack ottoman armies and settlements in the area. He himself sent a letter to an ally where he stated:\n&gt;I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea... We killed 23,884 Turks without counting those whom we burned in homes or the Turks whose heads were cut by our soldiers...Thus, your highness, you must know that I have broken the peace.\n\nQuoted here from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler\n\n\nTo claim that the ottoman were the aggressors, and Vlad Tepes was just trying to rule his country is wrong. He very clearly planned to go to war against the ottoman, and he also did attack parts of the ottoman empire. The attack against Wallachia was a punitive one from the ottomans, and was caused by Vlad Tepes affront against them. The ottoman empire did want control over Wallachia though, so you could argue that them wanting to keep Wallachia as a vassal state and to pay tribute also contributed to the war. \n\nThe narrative that seems to be through the comment chain is that Vlad Tepes was just trying to save his country, and that the impalements where just instruments in a war to discourage the enemy. Where some of the impalements probably meant to instill fear, a lot seems to be of a sadistic nature to punish those whom he felt transgressed him. They also make it seem like he kept Wallachia from being conquered and that he won the war against the ottomans, which simply didn't happen. The ottomans are also claimed to be the sole aggressors, whereas Vlad Tepes was the one who mainly caused the war to break out.\n\nTl;Dr: It gets claimed that Vlad Tepes impaled people to bluff the ottomans. This supposedly worked stellar and that saved Europe from being conquered by the ottomans, and kept his country safe. In reality he died at a later stage of the war against the ottomans and Wallachia became a vassal state for the ottoman empire. The ottoman empire also controlled large parts of the European continent in the next century as seen on this map: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire#/media/File:Territorial_changes_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_1566.jpg\n",

That being said what the hell is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ivan-eland/world-war-i-rather-than-w_b_5543998.html). I'm not sure who could write this and think that they did a good enough job to post it online.\n\nIt's a long post so let's get right to it and start breaking it down.\n\n&gt; Of course, World War II is more popular because we have its veterans still living, because the villains vanquished were more evil than those in the First World War, and because the United States sat unrivaled as a world power after its victory in the second war.\n\nThat's funny I remember another world power rivaling the United States after world war 2, must be my imagination.\n\n\n&gt; As for the United States, if you ask any American why the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, you will usually get a blank stare instead of an analysis of American actions prior to the attack -- the U.S. attempt to strangle the Japanese economy and military by cutting off petroleum-based exports (America was then the largest producer) in reaction to Japanese attempts to join the imperial club in East Asia, of which America and its allies were already members. Americans also conveniently forget that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt refused Japanese overtures to negotiate an end to the embargo and avoid war. FDR already had learned the false lesson of Munich that all negotiation to avoid war is appeasement.\n\nFuck. Right. Off. \n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Events_leading_to_the_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor#Background_to_conflict)\n\n&gt; Over the course of the 1930s, Japan's increasingly expansionist policies brought it into renewed conflict with its neighbors, Russia and China (Japan had fought the First Sino-Japanese War with China in 1894-95 and the Russo-Japanese War with Russia in 1904-05; Japan's imperialist ambitions had a hand in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in response to international condemnation of its conquest of Manchuria and subsequent establishment of the Manchukuo puppet government.[2] On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference because the United States and Great Britain refused to grant the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) parity with their navies.[3] A second full-scale war between Japan and China began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937.\n&gt; \n&gt; Japan's 1937 attack on China was condemned by the U.S. and several members of the League of Nations including Britain, France, Australia, and the Netherlands. Japanese atrocities during the conflict such as the notorious Nanking Massacre that December, served to further complicate relations with the rest of the world. The U.S., Britain, France and the Netherlands had including colonies in East and Southeast Asia. Japan's new military power and willingness to use it threatened Western economic and territorial interests in Asia. \n&gt; \n&gt; Beginning in 1938 the U.S. adopted a succession of increasingly restrictive trade restrictions with Japan. This included terminating its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan in 1939, further tightened by the Export Control Act of 1940. These efforts failed to deter Japan from continuing its war in China, or from signing the Tripartite Pact in 1940 with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, officially forming the Axis Powers.\n\nThose poor Japanese soldiers, all they wanted to do was [massacre and rape civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre) and falsely accuse countries of sabotage, [then illegally occupy them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War#Invasion_of_Manchuria.2C_interventions_in_China). Shame on the US for trying to get them to stop by denying them resources.\n\n&gt; But all this would not have happened if it hadn't been for American involvement in World War I, which tipped the victory to the allied side and caused Britain and France to falsely declare the Germans guilty of starting the war, rub its nose in defeat with heavy war reparations, and grab German and its losing allies' colonies overseas. Woodrow Wilson, the American president, also demanded that the German king, Kaiser Wilhelm II, abdicate. All of these post-war depredations paved the way for the rise of the hyper-nationalist and jingoistic Hitler.\n\n[Germany wasn't blamed for World War 1](http://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Treaty-of-Versailles-solely-blame-Germany-for-starting-World-War-I). Wilhelm was the King of Prussia not Germany and [his abdication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor#Abdication_and_flight) had nothing to do with Woodrow Wilson.\n\n&gt; In reality, France and Russia, with its rapid military build up prior to the outbreak of the First World War, probably behaved more aggressively than Germany did. But the winners of war write the history, and Germany's behavior in World War I now seems more aggressive in light of the evil Hitler's subsequent aggression in World War II, which Germany also lost.\n&gt; \n\nWhat the what.[ No, just no.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2o5rs5/why_did_germany_get_all_the_blame_for_wwi_when_it/)\n\n&gt; Austria-Hungary, Germany's ally prior to the First World War, understandably felt the need to respond to a Serbian government-backed assassination of its second highest ranking official--clearly an act of war. Germany backed an Austro-Hungarian ultimatum and war, thinking that the conflict could be contained on the Balkan Peninsula, as two prior conflicts were in the previous few years, because Russia would not enter the war on behalf of Serbia. That assumption proved to be wrong, because the French were pushing their ally Russia to turn a conflict in the Balkans into a general war in Europe to get Russian help against their old enemy Germany. Britain was aligned with France and Russia and also entered the fray.\n&gt; \n\n[Not quite.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I#July_Crisis)   \n\n&gt; Thus, if we go back farther in history, which Americans rarely do, we learn the opposite lesson from merely examining Munich 1938 and World War II.\n\nI think this racist. Someone please replace the words Americans with Jews in the article and see how it reads. Also how do we start at World War 1 and go farther back into history to World War 2 is beyond me.\n\n&gt; If the United States had let Germany win World War I by an exhausting 15-round decision, rather helping to achieve its knockout, the boundaries of Europe would have been slightly adjusted, as they had during all previous European wars that the United States had stayed out of. The 20th century probably wouldn't have been by far the bloodiest in world history, because World War II and the Cold War likely would not have occurred.\n&gt; \n\nFuck off.\n\n&gt; And World War I just keeps on giving in the 21st century. After the war, because Woodrow Wilson was willing to give his British and French allies anything for his failed League of Nations scheme, he not only let them tromp all over Germany by inflicting war guilt and reparations but let them steal overseas colonies from Germany and its ally, the defunct Ottoman Empire. The British and French both wanted Middle Eastern oil, so they drew artificial boundaries in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere that didn't correspond to the lines of their ethno-sectarian inhabitants. The conflict in all these places today is a result of World War I and its aftermath.\n&gt; \n\nWhat the hell is going on in this writers head?\n\n&gt; However, unfortunately most Americans view an interest in history as quaint or nerdy. Thus, their ill-informed nature allows politicians like Hillary Clinton, John McCain, and Dick Cheney to selectively mine history for lessons that will justify their often aggressive and ill-advised preferences for today's U.S. overseas meddling. That is why remembering back far enough is really important.\n&gt; \n\nThe ironic thing thing is we could have read the Wikipedia page on Frederick Turner or Charles Beard in the time it took to read this article. \n",

        "text": "While enjoying my morning cup of tea I was delighted to find an SRD post linking directly to comment by our old friend Droopy where he get's 300+ upvotes for [spewing ~~questionably~~ racist drivel all over /r/TodayILearned.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3b92ut/til_if_a_persons_body_odor_smells_good_to_you/csk329a)\n\nFor a laugh, I decided to scroll through his comment history a bit.\n\nThat was, until I found [this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/3ae5bi/heres_why_the_rebel_flag_still_flies_in_south/csg709b)\n\n&gt;One of the cardinal sins of histiography is projecting the present onto the past.\n\nOh god, he's learning. Evolving.\n\n&gt;That's the stock-in-trade of the modern spin-doctor (embarrassed by their parties' behavior). \"Er . . . uh . . . the parties have all switched sides, so . . . um . . . uh . . . let's retroactively pretend that Democratic governor Fritz Hollings in South Carolina was a Republican. Or that the Rebel Flag was a Republican flag (even though Lincoln was a Republican).\"\n\n[See my post from four days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3as0gu/kkk_were_democrats_who_not_only_targeted/) where I explain how politics hasn't always been left vs right in America and that the constituencies of Democrats and Republicans have shifted multiple times.\n\nThough it is ironic that Droopy was just talking about how bad it is to push the present into the past.\n\n&gt;You mentioned Lyndon B. Johnson. And he's instructive. He had something called \"The Southern Strategy\" to poach blacks from the Republican party [the party to which they belonged to since Lincoln put out the Emancipation Proclamation].\n\nWhat? Is this opposite day or something?\n\nThe phrase \"Southern Strategy\" is explicitly used to refer to **Nixon's** use of de-segregation to pick up the \"Solid South\" which was basically a conservative coalition within the mostly left-liberal Democratic party. The huge vote swing, along with the Democratic Party's fragmentation, won Nixon the election.\n\nAlso, outside of the South, the shift of African Americans to the Democratic Party began *much* earlier than the Nixon election.\n\n&gt;All top black leaders were Republicans. Frederick Douglas was a Republican. Edward W. Brooke (the first popularly elected black Senator) was a Republican. P.B.S. Pinchback (the first black governor in America) was a Republican. Martin Luther King, Sr. was a Republican. According to his sister, MLK Jr. was also a Republican.\n\nFrederick Douglas - Died in **1895**\n\nEdward W. Brooke - Did become a US senator in Massachusetts, he was very much a centrist who would later be there to appose Nixon's attempts to dismantle Johnson's programs.\n\nThe King's were both southerners. If they managed to vote, they would have voted Republican. \n\nEdit: Apparently Jr's sister never said that.\n\nNone of these really go to disrupt the idea that the Southern Democrats were a conservative coalition within a largely left-leaning party.\n\n&gt; In fact, his \"I Have A Dream\" speech was largely plagiarized by a speech read at the Republican National Convention of 1952 (by Archibald Carey). \n\nIt was not \"largely plagiarized,\" King obviously drew inspiration from the Archibald Carey in the final passage by using similar allusions to \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\"\n\nAlso, yes. The Republican Party in 1952 did support civil rights as part of it's platform, as did the Democratic Party. Carey would later be appointed to a position in the whitehouse under Eisenhower.\n\n\n&gt;While a Republican President [Dwight Eisenhower] was ending de-segregation, Lyndon B. Johnson said that he had a strategy to poach the blacks from the Party of Lincoln.\n\nI think he means that Eisenhower was \"ending segregation.\" Though, that's really a stretch. \n\n&gt;He's recorded talking about his Great New Society, and its entitlement programs, saying, \"We have to give them something. Not enough so that it matters. But just enough to pull them away. We'll have those niggers voting Democrat for 200 years!\"\n\n[.......](http://i.imgur.com/pRYx882.png?1)\n\n&gt;So it requires a massive amount of historical revisionism to turn the Party of Lincoln into the \"black-haters\" and Lyndon B. Johnson into a champion of civil rights.\n\nThough \"black haters\" and \"champion of civil rights\" are obviously exaggerations that are problematic in their own sense, I have a feeling that this guy's personal views are not much better.\n\n&gt;He's the same guy who during the 1968 Chicago riots said, \"We need to watch out for the National Guard. The last thing we need is a pregnant nigger shot.\"\n\n[.......](http://i.imgur.com/9xQjKO8.png?1)\n\n&gt;If this is your idea of \"the good guy\" to combat those evil Republicans (who have that long history of freeing slaves, promoting blacks to leadership positions in government, and who wrote 95% of all civil rights legislation), then so be it.\n\nI have a feeling that 95% is wrong but the more important take away is that It wouldn't matter whether they wrote *all* of the Civil Rights legislation. The Republican party is a completely different institution now. So is The Democratic Party. \n\nPolitical Parties Are Not Frozen In Time.\n\nThe rest is just him Straw Manning changes in political affiliation. Apparently if there is no magical switch where every single voter jumps ship then constituencies never change. Unless, of course, welfare is involved. But don't worry guys, he's totally not forcing his questionable understanding of modern politics into the past!",

While there are probably other great examples, I thought first of two major pre-colonial American economies: the Iroquois and the Inca. \n\nThe Iroquois used primarily a present based economy, mixed with communal ownership. According to *The Economics of the Iroquois*, \"their kindness, humanity, and courtesy not only make them liberal with what they have, but cause them to possess hardly anything except in common. A whole village must be without corn before any individual can be obliged to endure privation.‎\" In Iroquois society, when a gift was given, there was not legal requirement of compensation, but an expectation that if a deed was done for the community or an individual, there would be a deed done in return. This is clearly not a market economy, because market rely on the exchange of currency to function. \n\nAs for their status as a \"major civilization,\" Howard Zinn states in *A People's History of America* that the Iroquois were \"the most powerful of the Northeastern Tribes.\" The Iroquois were united by a single language, united against outside forces, and had a strong system of government, all of which are signs of an organized society which could be considered a civilization. \n\nAnother powerful American civilization, the Inca, also maintained a market-less economy. According to *The Cambridge Economic History of Latin America,* the Inca used a state run economy based on redistribution. The state owned the entire economy, but established a system were food and resources were provided for individuals. The Inca controlled vast areas in Western South America, and the state used its control over the economy the transfer resources between different areas. Instead of using markets, the Inca used a welfare and state ownership based system.\n\nTL;DR: OP's most likely euro-centric world view has ignored at least two \"major civilizations\" in his assertion that market economies are the way things have always been done everywhere.",

        "text": "I bought [this book](http://www.michaelstusser.com/deadguyinterviews.php) a while ago, and it's been a treasure trove of bad history so far.\n\nLet's start from the interview of Genghis Khan. From the introductory section\n\n&gt; Genghis [ended] ten thousand years of Mongol infighting\n\nNotice the word \"Mongol\" rather than \"Mongolian\" was used so this implies that from around BC 8794 to AD 1206, there was infighting among a people identifiable as the Mongols.\n\nThere isn't any reason to believe this is true. First, I find it really doubtful that any ethnic identity would have managed to coherently survive for *ten millennia* in a place wide open to the world like the Eurasian steppes. I mean, even Greenland has seen multiple cultural shifts in the past few centuries. And of course there's the issue of how a Mongol is defined. Speaking a Mongolic language doesn't make you a Mongol, any more than speaking a Germanic language makes you a German. For example, the Kara-Khitans spoke a Para-Mongolic language but neither their Mongol conquerors nor the Kara-Khitans themselves nor modern historians consider(ed) them as a Mongol polity. Although ancient peoples like the Xianbei or Rouruan spoke a *Mongolic* language they were not really *Mongols* per se.\n\n\n&gt; By crushing opponents all over the Eurasian continent (from the Adriatic Sea to the Pacific coast of China)\n\n[Genghis's empire at the time of his death.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Genghis_khan_empire_at_his_death.png) Much of China wasn't conquered. Zhongdu (Beijing) had fallen but the Jurchen court would still be in existence in Kaifeng until 1233 and the Southern Song hadn't been directly invaded. Of course Genghis never saw the Adriatic Sea, and later Mongols never conquered the Adriatic coastline. \n\nThe interview starts off with undiluted bad history:\n\n&gt; [Interviewer]: First off, any relation to Chaka Khan?\n\n&gt; Genghis Khan: Khan is bestowed only upon Universal Emperor by Mongol chieftains, you little runt!\n\nDid Genghis suffer severe memory loss after his death? Seems like it. The title *khan* itself isn't limited to a universal ruler, or even to the Mongols. [Ong Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooril_Khan) is a famous example of a Mongol khan with hardly universal power. For non-Mongol khans there are countless examples, from [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Khanate) to [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurhaci) and [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanate_of_Sibir) to [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz_Khanate). *Khan* is a word found in hundreds of languages, including most Turkic languages, so it's hardly a surprise. \n\n&gt; [Interviewer]: Germans taught you how to mine, Indians showed you astronomy, Muslims taught you math, Italians showed you how to be silver-smiths. It's time you learned something for yourself.\n\nGenghis Khan did not personally mine or forge silver, and I'm fairly confident he didn't know much about astronomy or mathematics. So \"you\" here should probably refer to the Mongols as a people, not Genghis himself. \n\n1. The inhabitants of modern Mongolia were already mining and forging bronze more than three thousand years ago, and the inhabitants of the Altai Mountains fashioned well-executed gold artifacts. After the forging of their empire the Mongols in the west utilized the silver mines of the Near East like the Seljuks had, and the Yuan Dynasty operated its own mines. And Germans had a negligible effect on the Mongol empire anyways. So no, the Germans did not teach mining to the Mongols.\n1. Chinese astronomers were also prized in the Mongol realm, and for a century a Muslim observatory operated in Dadu (Beijing). [The Maragreh Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maragheh_observatory) operated by the Ilkhanids merged the astronomic achievements of the known world from Andalusia to China and was one of the most prestigious observatories in the world, but it was built under the direction of a [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi), not an Indian. Astronomy in the Mongol Empire was not limited to Indians.\n1. Again, both the Yuan Dynasty and the Ilkhanids (and others) operated silver mines and forged the metal using Chinese/Islamic/etc knowledge, and *Marco Polo himself noted this* (see quotes from [this translation](http://www.munseys.com/diskone/marcopolo.pdf) below). There's no need to put in some sort of civilizing Italian teaching the barbarian Orientals how to deal with silver.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable presents of gold, silver, and precious stones\n\n--\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a small silver label\n\n--\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tablets of gold or of silver appropriated to their ranks\n\n--\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a plate of silver\n\n--\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; weave tissues of silver and gold in great quantities\n\nAnd besides memory loss Genghis unfortunately also seems to have lost most of his intelligence and his capability of self-expression between his death and the interview, morphing into some sort of sadistic infant. For example, this thoughtful reply from the deceased khagan to the interviewer's question:\n\n&gt; Shiny. Chingis like.\n\nPoor, poor Temujin, suffering from dementia after his death  :(\n\n---\n\nBonus Mesoamerican bad history, with Montezuma [*sic*] featured! \n\n&gt; He conquered many [...] tribes \n\n--\n\n&gt; The Tlaxcalan tribe\n\nTlaxcalans, Mixtecs, and other Mesoamerican groups were all urbanized polities with populations up to the millions and an organized bureaucracy. The term \"tribe\" is an amazingly bad and amazingly frequent mischaracterization of indigenous American and African polities. \n\n&gt; Montezuma: We thought [the Spaniards] were gods.\n\n[You're wrong, Monty](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rgsfl/is_there_any_truth_to_the_commonly_cited_fact/cdn7avv)\n",

Napoleon created a tactic where 3 people would support each other, as there was a complicated and time consuming musket loading process. 2 Of those people would always be lying low, the other would shoot.

Breach loading meant, the two supporters were not needed, so lesser generals went back to not using any cover at all.\n\n1. Napoleon did not invent this.

We literally got a lions led by donkeys case where we're advocating **less** modern tactics as better.\n\n&gt; I'm not a military man, but I think simply using cover and building a defensive line slightly outside the range of the enemy rifles would be a good start. Then some of the soldiers storm forward, taking a shot at the enemy, and then find any cover or just lay low, reloading their guns, and keeping the enemy down, while the next wave does the same, but goes somewhat further when there's not too much enemy fire, or takes cover behind or together with other soldiers, just in shooting distance to the enemy, when resistance is higher.\n\nNow he's contradicting himself. He's also committing the cardinal sin of armchair historians -- EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVER IS JUST THAT SIMPLE *FART NOISES*\n\nYes, \"just\" use cover (which is miraculously there) and build a defensive line \"slightly outside the range of enemy rifles.\" God forbid the enemy rifles move forward a bit so you're in range again. God forbid they don't just sit there and let you do that. God forbid you actually need to take land rapidly. \n\nThen you just send the soldiers to \"storm forward and take a shot at the enemy\" then \"find any cover or just lay low\". It's just that simple! Why had no one ever thought of that before!\n\nOh wait, *they fucking did.* That's precisely how this style of war was fought. Two skirmish lines of infantry, about 200-300m in frontage and 25-50m apart, more or less depending (infantry chains gave that kind of flexibility, basically proto-Mission Tactics). The front line would approach while the rear line covered. First round took ground, secured it, and the next round advanced and took over and 'leapfrogged' ahead. Rinse and repeat. \n\nLike he flat out says that if resistance is high, **which it was because this was literally half the French army encircled**, the soldiers should just settle down and overwhelm them with fire. Which is precisely what's happening in the freaking photo.\n\n&gt; Not really - they are staying in line instead of overwhelming the less defended areas first and quickly finding cover between the enemy lines. \n\n\"Finding cover\"\n\nWhere? They're in an open field?\n\n&gt; They are not using each other as cover. \n\nWTF does that even mean????\n\n&gt; The lines are too far apart to effectively cover one-another. \n\nThese rifles have a 700m range and they're, at most, 50m apart. \n\n&gt; And so on. This is a very static way of fighting, more from the laziness of the leadership than from usefulness.\n\nDAE LIONS LED BY DONKEYS?!?!\n\nThis is literally the most sophisticated, low level initiative allowing, mobile form of warfare ever devised in the history of the gunpoweder era up to that point. \"Static fighting\" my ass.\n\n&gt; I can see that they stay in formation - one line, making an easy target once they get in shooting range.\n\nYou literally just said they should group up more to overwhelm the enemy. Make up your mind. It was deemed that keeping the men organized and permitting fire control, the thing you praised in the first quote, was not outweighed by the damage taken from enemy fire. *Especially* because infantry vs infantry combat accounted for an abysmally low amount of total casualties in 19th and 20th century warfare.\n\n&gt; Advancing in straight lines is easy to train and to manage during a battle. makes it easy to keep an overview, too. Putting such minor simplifications over the lives of soldiers seems a bad idea to me.\n\nYeah giving hundreds of thousands of conscripts a simple form of fighting is such a bad idea.\n\n&gt; As I see it, the people who are under cover in the back can't shoot because their own people are in the way 50 yards ahead.\n\nWell that'd be wrong.\n\n&gt; Also, a static distance of 50 yards makes it difficult to deal with stronger resistance in some places, and impossible to exploit weaker defences in other places.\n\nIt wasn't static.\n\n&gt; Stopping to fire to find and target enemies is different from stopping because your own people are blocking the line of sight.\n\nThat's not what's fucking happening Jesus.\n\n&gt; I also wonder why you get upset so much about a little questioning of what was done. It's obvious that one can find better ways retrospectively - in anything. And it's much more enlightening to think about those (and discuss them) than letting everything stand as the best possible thing as it used to be.\n\nNo, armchair generaling is not a noble virtue in studying history.\n\n&gt; I dare say for instance that if Napoleon III had been as clever as Napoleon, he would have spent the time to develop new and better tactics, strategies, doctrines, and so on - with exactly the effort you mentioned. And this might have led to a completely different outcome of the war of 1870. Which also can be interesting to speculate about.\n\nAre you fuckin kiddin me.

This is a very static way of fighting, more from the laziness of the leadership than from usefulness.\n\nDAE LIONS LED BY DONKEYS?!?!\n\nThis is literally the most sophisticated, low level initiative allowing, mobile form of warfare ever devised in the history of the gunpoweder era up to that point. \"Static fighting\" my ass.\n\n&gt; I can see that they stay in formation - one line, making an easy target once they get in shooting range.\n\nYou literally just said they should group up more to overwhelm the enemy. Make up your mind. It was deemed that keeping the men organized and permitting fire control, the thing you praised in the first quote, was not outweighed by the damage taken from enemy fire. *Especially* because infantry vs infantry combat accounted for an abysmally low amount of total casualties in 19th and 20th century warfare.\n\n&gt; Advancing in straight lines is easy to train and to manage during a battle. makes it easy to keep an overview, too. Putting such minor simplifications over the lives of soldiers seems a bad idea to me.\n\nYeah giving hundreds of thousands of conscripts a simple form of fighting is such a bad idea.\n\n&gt; As I see it, the people who are under cover in the back can't shoot because their own people are in the way 50 yards ahead.\n\nWell that'd be wrong.\n\n&gt; Also, a static distance of 50 yards makes it difficult to deal with stronger resistance in some places, and impossible to exploit weaker defences in other places.\n\nIt wasn't static.\n\n&gt; Stopping to fire to find and target enemies is different from stopping because your own people are blocking the line of sight.\n\nThat's not what's fucking happening Jesus.\n\n&gt; I also wonder why you get upset so much about a little questioning of what was done. It's obvious that one can find better ways retrospectively - in anything. And it's much more enlightening to think about those (and discuss them) than letting everything stand as the best possible thing as it used to be.\n\nNo, armchair generaling is not a noble virtue in studying history.\n\n&gt; I dare say for instance that if Napoleon III had been as clever as Napoleon, he would have spent the time to develop new and better tactics, strategies, doctrines, and so on - with exactly the effort you mentioned. And this might have led to a completely different outcome of the war of 1870. Which also can be interesting to speculate about.\n\nAre you fuckin kiddin me. DAE tektiks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politics, logistics, strategy???\n\n/end circlejerk\n\nSource: Michael Howard, *The Franco Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870-1871*\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello fellow Badhistorians!\n\nI know this skirts two of the moratoriums this month, but I think I can JUST squeak this one in. See [this book.](http://www.amazon.ca/Boy-Striped-Pajamas-John-Boyne/dp/0385751532/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435195374&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+boy+in+the+striped+pajamas)\n\nThat fucking book...\n\nA little back story first. If you just care about the facts scroll down to the break. You see, back in 2007, I was attending college and decided to take a children's lit class. Not knowing it was purely aimed at aspiring teachers, I was shocked to learn that the class focused on teaching tragedy via literature to children. I thought it was going to focus on crtiticism of the literature itself - you know, like most English Lit classes. I was the only male in the class and the only student not looking to get in to elementary or Secondary education. Being a stupid kid, I almost dropped out. Fortunately, I had an amazing prof and amazing classmates. I loved the class. It was such an interesting foray into an entirely different way of thinking for me and really influenced the way I thought. Learning how education worked was so eye opening - even if just for a semester.\n\nThat was until the topic of the Holocaust came up. We discussed as a class how something so dark could be presented to children. As the token Jew in the class (how can you tell if someone is Jewish? don't worry, they'll tell you) I was asked my opinion on what works I would suggest. Obviously I brought up Anne Frank's diary. Another student, however, brought up her new favourite piece of Children's lit - John Boyne's *The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.* I was intrigued - though the name \"Boyne\" didn't fill me with confidence, my classmate's enthusiasm for the story made me compelled to read it.\n\nAfter that, I swore never to speak of the book again. it was a wreck. A horrible tale that seemed to both be factually inaccurate and ultimately whitewashing at the same time. I argued tooth and nail that it was the *worst* piece of literature to use to teach the Holocaust. I could go on and on about the shitty storytelling, or the complete misunderstanding of Jewish culture, or the shitty prose, but this isn't /r/literatureidontlike. This is /r/badhistory dammit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nSynopsis - A little German Boy moves with his Nazi family to Auschwitz. He for some reason is able to get close enough to the camp itself that he meets a little Jewish boy and they quickly become besties. He is also painfully ignorant of the entire world around him. After a series of ridiculous events, the little German boy breaks in to the camp and is gassed along with his Jewish friend. Cue tears.\n\n**1. Children in Germany could not apparently understand German**\n\nThis was the first thing that crossed my mind as I cracked the freshly bound spine of that loathsome paperback. Bruno apparently does not understand the German language. he calls his new home \"Out-with\" and this funny man who likes his dad \"the Fury.\" Auschwitz is a proper German name and sounds nothing like \"Out-with.\" Führer is also German for \"leader.\" I understand the author is trying to show the child's innocence, but it comes off as contrived. This also leads directly in to my next point.\n\n**2. Children were completely unaware of what was going on**\n\nThe amount of indoctrination in Nazi Germany was staggering. To think a child of a Commandant in the SS would be ignorant of Nazi ideology is just bad history AND storytelling. There were Nazi [board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_board_games) and [children's books.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Giftpilz) There was also a little thing called the [Hitler Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth). While Bruno was just too young to be a member, to assume he wouldn't know any boys who were a year or two older than him that were is ludicrous. By 1936 there were 5 million members. 5 million.\n\nThis is probably the most infuriating portion of the story. The lesson of the holocaust is one of the power of propaganda, herd mentality and nationalism. Combined these already powerful tools can become overwhelming and evil. By removing the effect of these on Bruno you are essentially telling kids that this was just some distant thing to most people living in Germany. Which, again, moves in to my next point.\n\n**3. Germans were unaware of what was going on in their own backyards**\n\nThis is something I see come up time and again. The population just didn't understand what was happening to the Jews. In fact, [it's estimated that 1/3 to 1/2 Germans understood that the Holocaust was happening.](https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/up-in-smoke-goes-the-lie-that-the-holocaust-was-a-big-secret/203103.article)\n\nThis was no big secret.\n\n~~**4. And finally - there were no children in camps**~~\n\n~~None. Zero. Zilch. Nadda. the truth was much more horrifying. [They were fucking gassed on arrival](http://www.aish.com/j/as/48965671.html).~~\n\nUltimately the story fails at what it sets out to do - teach a big, scary topic to children. Instead it whitewashes history. It paradoxically exonerates the German people while teach dick all about how this horrible event could happen.\n\nThis isn't Holocaust denile - this is Holocaust Disneyfication.\n\n*Edit. I was wrong. There were children at Auschwitz. See below. I am an idiot. ",

        "text": "I've been making my way through \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" and recently came across [this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLnfap2VC0A) from season 3, episode 10 (there's no spoilers, unless you've never, ever seen the show or know nothing about it, in which case it's a bit a spoilery). What matters in this clip, though, is not the characters or the plot or anything along those lines. No, what matters is that the show gets the weather in Dublin on Christmas in 1838 wrong. \n\nThe clip shows Dublin covered in a Dickensian winter, complete with carollers singing in a Dickensian fashion, hanson cabs, and drunken Irishmen stumbling through several inches of snow ([this picture](http://i.imgur.com/QIHisRB.png) suggests maybe six inches, though I'll admit, I haven't seen real snow in years, so anything on the ground might as well be an avalanche). It's a nice image, and, as I said, it certainly matches the Dickensian image of the British isles in the mid 19th century. The problem is that snow is not a common thing in Dublin, even in the middle of the Little Ice Age. \n\nThe winter of 1838/39 was a particularly harsh one in Ireland, playing host to one of the worst storms in Irish history. The winter saw an early frost decimating a large portion of the crops, contributing even further to a famine that was tearing across the country. As [this site](http://booty.org.uk/booty.weather/climate/1800_1849.htm) recording the weather throughout the British Isles over that century shows, storms wreaked havoc across Ireland, Scotland, and England, destroying crops, knocking down buildings, and generally being not terribly friendly. \n\nAll of this might lead one to believe that there could have been snow in Ireland on Christmas in 1838. After all, January 5, 1839 saw the start of the *Oíche na Gaoithe Móire*, or Night of the Big Wind, one of the worst storms in Irish history. This storm was so bad that \"[snow buried on the cottages and cattle froze to death in the fields](http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/emigration/pre-fam.htm).\" Indeed, people throughout Ireland saw it as a sign that the end was nigh, and that God had finally completely abandoned Ireland. By the Feast of Epiphany (6 January), snow buried Ireland to the point where the landscape was unrecognisable. It's an event that people used (and still use, to a certain extent) to mark time in Ireland. Things were seen as happening before or after the Night of the Great Wind.\n\nHowever, even a couple weeks earlier, the weather was cold, but not snowy. In her book \"[Rambles in the South of Ireland During the Year 1838\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=XnwEAAAAQAAJ), Lady Henrietta Georgiana M. Chatterton writes about having to \"sleep where the rain came down upon us\" all through December. Indeed, she goes on and on about the Irish weather, saying things like:\n\n&gt; The skies of Ireland, like the faces of its people, are ever beaming with smiles or melting with tears... Often the sun shines with dazzling brightness on one mountain, giving a vivid and rainbow hue to its heath and rock, while the adjoining heights frown in gloomy sternness as if in anger at those dark clouds which deprive them of what the poet I have just alluded to terms \"a sunburst.\"\n\nWhile I am aware of the author's bias, seeing as she's not Irish and a resident who would have spent a great deal of time imbibing the fabulous Irish weather, you would think that she might talk about snow if she saw it, especially since she talks about the Night of the Big Wind by saying:\n\n&gt; the wind swept along in such violent gusts that it was impossible to hold up an umbrella, and we had much difficulty keeping our seats on the car.\n\nIn short, then, Lady Chatterton didn't seem to notice the snow, suggesting that maybe there wasn't snow in Dublin on Christmas in 1838. Indeed, despite the harsh winter that Ireland had in 1838, it seems unlikely that there was that much snow, if any, in Dublin on Christmas. It would have been cold, but snow was rare, making the Night of the Big Wind all that much more unique. Buffy the Vampire Slayer should not be relied on as a source of information about the climate of mid-19th century Ireland. \n\nSources:\n\nOh god, I actually have [sources](http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/BigWind.html) for a [post](http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/emigration/pre-fam.htm) about [whether](http://booty.org.uk/booty.weather/climate/1800_1849.htm) or not Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an accurate depiction of history.

        "text": "(This is an old one (2010) which I was reminded of while reading this subreddit. I apologize if my explanation of why this is bunk isn't terribly long, I hope it should be pretty self evident. I'll do my best!)  \n\nA wonderful young guy (no irony, he seems genuinely nice, just brainwashed) called **Ancalimon** appeared on the Mount&amp;Blade game forums, starting threads mostly devolving into conspiracy theorist rambling. (reason why I post here is because the bad history is hilariously bad.)  \n**edit:** Seeing some of the gems I posted in the comments, this could easily fit into /r/badlinguistics as well. :)  \n  \n**Before we begin - about Scythians and Turks**  \n&gt;The Scythians, also known as Scyth, Saka, Sakae, Sacae, Sai, Iskuzai, or Askuzai, were a large group of Iranian nomads who were mentioned by the literate peoples surrounding them as inhabiting large areas in the central Eurasian steppes from about the 9th century BC up until the 4th century AD. Their Scythian languages probably belonged to the Eastern branch of the Iranian languages. The \"classical Scythians\" known to ancient Greek historians were located in the northern Black Sea and fore-Caucasus region. Other Scythian groups documented by Assyrian, Achaemenid and Chinese sources show that they also existed in Central Asia, where they were referred to as the Iskuzai/Askuzai, Saka .**The relationships between the peoples living in these widely separated regions remains unclear.** The term \"Scythian\" is used by modern scholars in an archaeological context for finds perceived to display attributes of the \"Scytho-Siberian\" culture, usually without implying an ethnic or linguistic connotation.    \n(from the Wiki article on Scythians: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians)  \n\nWhen Ancalimon talks about Turks, he’s not talking just about inhabitants of modern Turkey, he means the (proto-)Turkic tribes that appeared in the later Scythian period. The first definite reference to the \"Turks\" come mainly from Chinese sources in the sixth century.  \n\n**Claim n.1)**  *\"Scythians were Turks! Iranian-Scythian theory is a Russian conspiracy!   Indo-European language family is world-spanning conspiracy! Everyone is a Turk and they just forgot they were Turks!\"*  \nhttp://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,68262.msg2711022.html#msg2711022\n\n**Why this is bunk:**  \n- he was posting articles from \"http://s155239215.onlinehome.us\", a known panturkist conspiracy theory website.  \n- he constantly changed his posts and kept editing them after we pointed out the lies and misconceptions about how linguistics and anthropology work. Example of such edit:   \n&gt;Also Herodotus mentions Scythians producing an alcoholic drink from Horse milk (which we name KIMIZ) (edited)    \n-(originally he claimed there was a connection, because Herodotus called the drink \"kimiz\". Herodotus never uses the word \"kimiz\", “koumis” or any variants of it. He mentions Scythians using blind slaves for stirring milk and gathering cream from the top.)  \n\nMain claim:  \n&gt;The use of conical hats, composite bows, portable homes (yurts), horse husbandry, tamgas, kurgan burials (this alone is enough to prove the Turkic presence. Kurgans were Turkic they \"still\" are Turkic), sour horse milk, a peculiar milking device in a shape of a flute, meaty diet, leather boots, meridional coaching, central cemeteries, religious rites associated with prominent trees and mountains, wrestling traditions, bride-groom wrestling, identical dress style between sexes (unlike Persians), last rites procession around a country of a deceased leader, Scythian animal art, belts and harnesses essential in nomadic life, cauldrons and utensils (guess what Inquisition did to women who had these and were not Christian (PAGAN(tm)) in Europe during the DARK AGES(tm), voluntary confederation type political structure (does it ring a bell?), equal rights for women (unlike Persians and very much like Turks), and eternal mercenaries in all surrounding states.   \nEven though some elements of each of these traits were found between peoples historically interacting with Scythians, none of the Indo-Iranian peoples are documented in the historical times to have even a small fraction of the typical Scythian ethnological traits. Instead, the Indo-Iranian tribes are documented as agricultural, sedentary, grain-consuming, never mastering long-distance horse husbandry, non-meat eaters and non-milk drinkers, never mastering composite bows, with distributed cemeteries, forced political autocratic society, forceful male domination (does Europe ring a bell? or Inquisition), positively not wearing conical hats, and employing mounted mercenary armies. The ethnological argument of the critics points to the fact that instead of the Indo-Iranian tribes, these ethnological traits are inherent to the Türk history and culture.  \n\nIt's a common attitude for nationalist historical revisionists, where they refuse to understand chronology and causality. If a culture they belong to shares traits with previous cultures, that means the previous culture must've been the same as they are.   \nHe contrasts Scythian customs to those of Achaemenid Persians (which he doesn’t describe accurately) to prove no link could be made with Iran. Alas, he forgets that Persia came to be the way it was in hundreds of years, having occupied many sedentary nations. It became re-nomadised culturally again, during the Parthian empire. (which followed into the Sassanid era) \nIt’s also important to realize that “Iranian” doesn’t equal “Persian”.  \n  \n  \n**Now, what do we know of the earliest Turkic people?**  \n*\"It is generally agreed that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from Central Asia to Siberia with the majority of them living in China historically. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.[62] The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 B.C\"* (from Wikipedia article on \"Turkic people\": https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Turkic_peoples)  \n  \nThere is certainly cultural overlap between the Xiongnu and the Scytho-Siberian cultural group *(see Esther Jacobson - \"The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia\", or her new book which just came out, or Mallory and Mair - \"The Tarim Mummies\")*.   \nIt is however a relationship of indirect influences (through war, trade, diplomacy etc., not a direct descendancy) and coincidental similarities caused by the nomadic-pastoralist lifestyle they shared and the area type they both inhabited.  \n\nWhat little we know of Scythian and Xiongnu languages (mostly from their names) leads to several theories:  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu#Ethno-linguistics  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythian_languages  \n  \nNone of those that could be considered a reasonable consensus include Scythians being secretly Turkic. ;)  \nI should also point out that a lot of what he's talking about as proof of Scythian Turkicness is not established among the Xiongnu and only comes from later Turkic people. (and is therefore irrelevant, as they could've easily adopted these things from non-Turkic nomads)  \n  \n  \n**Claim n.2)** *Indo European language family is outdated nonsense, even (some?) European scholars admitted it! (that one time in a French journal in 2000, supposedly.)*  \nhttp://i44.tinypic.com/2643tio.jpg  \n\nHis quote:  \n*\"Western researchers, till this day have concluded that whatever they found is related Indo-European languages. It will take very long time to correct these mistakes and show how this attitude has led to many misleading ideas. This error will keep corrupting history and cultural history (until this is fixed). If you think about the fact that Indo-European languages theory must be left to die, and the fact that it has already spread to masses into consideration, it'll become evident that we are in a huge scientific catastrophe.\"  \nIf you like, you can translate the whole article to English.  \nThis means Indo-European languages theory is a dead end. It doesn't put the extreme Turkic influence on India into consideration, which is a fact that's ignored by scientists for 200 years. The migration patterns of the Turks left many visible prints on their path all the way to Africa, Europe, and America. And I feel the urge (don't know why) to remind you that oldest human-like skeleton found in Africa doesn't change anything. Afrikaans didn't migrate and they never had the technology (like iron and horse riding) to migrate unlike Proto-Turks. This \"proto\" part being disputed because actually the concept of being a Turk (because of the tamgas) is found all over the world.*  \n\nI OCRd the image and tried Google Translate, found nothing like the quote he posted. Anyone speaking French could confirm it's there?  \n(even if it was, the IE theory is pretty much scientific consensus, still.)  \n  \n  \n**Claim n. 3)** *\"Odin was a Turk and Vikings were too! This Swedish historian said so in the 18th century! Of course it's been covered up since then.\"*  \n\n&gt;Let me try a totally different approach and end my role.  \n  \n&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=tEACAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sven+lagerbring+Swea+rikes+historia&amp;lr=&amp;ei=bC7jS8yfDYSuzASOj_HxCQ&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\nPage 52 and further. \"2 Kapitlet.

Oden and his comrades were Turks.\"  \nThere is also a strange story about this book and the Ottoman Viking Gustaf Nuring (who later changed his name to Ali Nuri) Thanks to him, today we can read this book.\nhttp://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Lagerbring  \nThis book was and is not not publicly available and that must be the reason why he is considered Father of Sweden.  \n\nAnd so we get to his other thread:  \nhttp://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,113196.0.html  \n\nhttp://www.antalyaonline.net/futhark/IR5.GIF  \n&gt;*notice ODIN being read in Turkish as BİLGE IŞ (WISE MAN THAT BRINGS KNOWLEDGE) (The writing is read from right to left in Turkic) (the writing cannot be read in any other language and thought to be magic of ODIN by neo-linguists)  \nThis is accepted as the FUTHARK (notice the FUTHARK from left to right)*  \n\n**Why is this bunk?** Odin is not the original form of the norse god's name:  \n\"chief Teutonic god, the All-Father, a 19c. revival in reference to Scandinavian neo-paganism, from Danish, from Old Norse Oðinn, from Proto-Germanic **Wodanaz**, name of the chief Germanic god (source of Old English Woden, Old High German Wuotan), from PIE *wod-eno-, wod-ono- \"raging, mad, inspired,\" from root wet- (1) \"to blow; inspire, spiritually arouse\" (see wood (adj.)).\"  \n\nInterestingly, he wasn’t the first to come up with the idea!  \n- https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Jakten_p%C3%A5_Odin    \n- https://mikespassingthoughts.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/some-thoughts-on-the-accounts-of-the-norse-god-odin-as-a-man/  \n- http://www.wilmer-t.net/fornnorden/AncientNordic/HumanOdin.html  \n\n**Claim n.4**) *Romans didn’t know Iron and were awestruck by the majestic Kipchaks  (bonus: Christians were actually Tengriist Turks, until they weren’t and then it was the witches they burned who were Pagan, which means Turks.)*  \n\n&gt;The Kipchaks' arrival at the boundaries of the Roman Empire and their brilliant victory over Iran impressed all, Christians above all. The Kipchaks were on everybody's lips - they were too outlandish to go unnoticed. Their iron armour and weapons made them look out of a different world in the Europeans' eyes. And they really were - from the bright world under the high sky of Tengri.  \n    Heathen Europe looked at them bottom-up, like a foot soldier does at a horseman. Europe lost to the Turkis on all counts, the principal of which was faith in God - really an asset it lacked conspicuously, in God who gave the Turkic people plenty of iron and an ability to make the most of it.  \n    A simple example will emphasise the importance of iron. A well-landed blow with an iron sword could cut a bronze one in two. In other words, Roman troops had no arms to resist the Kipchaks. Like prehistoric men with nothing else but wooden clubs.  \n    You can say whatever and however you like about the collapse of the Roman Empire, put forward any hypotheses and make any guesses. All discussion would be a waste of time unless you consider this simple fact.  \n\n**Why is this bunk?**  \n-There were no Kipchaks at the time. (Turkic people cca. 11th-13th century AD)  \n-The book he’s quoting was written by Kazım Mirşan:   http://adji.ru/book11_1.html     (*“THE KIPCHAKS\nAn Ancient History of the Turkic People and the Great Steppe\nA Handbook for Schoolchildren and Their Parents”*)  \n- Romans, of course, knew and used iron, as well as cavalry.  \n\nThis goes on and on. Both threads are a goldmine! Eventually, this guy developed a “proto-Turk” language, where a single syllable could have multiple meanings and he’d use this to explain various words in other languages (even modern ones), which obviously meant everyone was secretly a Turk.  \n\nI’m sorry if this was a bit long, we’ve argued with him a LOT.  \nIf there’s anything that needs explanation, or sources, let me know! \n",

But in the liberal mind, kkk were Republicans. Lincoln was a Democrat to them. Democrats raising the Confederate flag were really Republicans, but the democrat JFK in office at the same was still a Democrat.\n\n&gt;Any prosperity in the past, if it was a Republican president, they were Democrat. Good Democrats were Democrats. Bad Democrats were republicans. It's none stop with the liberals.\n\n\nHe's technically correct but this guy is heavily implying that the Democrats have always been Liberal.\n\nThe First wave of the KKK was created by veterans of the Confederate Army in 1865. This was in the midst of reconstruction and the KKK basically was bent on maintaining the current social order and racial hierarchy. So they were Conservative, socially at least.\n\nI guess he's pushing our modern party system into the past and trying to make sense of things?  So, I guess I'll argue that Democrats and Republicans were not always left and right wing respectively.....\n\n***************\n\nThe Third Party System (1850-90) was marked by broad coalitions that are hard to comprehend for people with an understanding of only European Multi-Party systems and the current American Party system. Interest politics played a much larger role than ideology for example.\n\nCommercial farmers, skilled workers, buisnessmen, and shop owners preferred the Republican Party. Freedmen also drifted towards the Republicans. In turn, pushing pissy white southerners towards the Democratic Party. \n\nThe Democratic Party was split between Bourbon and Agrarian Democrats. The former supported business interests and disenfranchising African Americans. The latter was a Populist wing which would come to shake up the political system once Bryan was elected. Or, actually, when McKinley beat him later.  \n\nThe Fourth Party System (1890-1930) saw the Democratic Party split so bad that politics were dominated by the Republican party who now controlled the northeast and Midwest. It also saw the growth of Progressivism within both parties.\n\nThe Second Klan was associated with Southern Democrats who maintained a hold on the south by supporting disenfranchisement but the Liberal and Catholic Democrats began attacking the Klan. \n\nThe Fifth Party System (1930-70) was brought on by the Great Depression. FDR's election realigned the party system around his New Deal Coalition which was made up of liberal groups, organized labor, southerners, city machines, rural populists, and urban progressives.\n\nDuring their stint as a minority party, the Republicans were split between a left and right wing but by the late 50's the left leaning elements of the Republican Party had mostly been stamped out. The Democrats were, at this point, mostly left leaning Progressives and American liberals, outside of the \"Solid South\" which was made up of a Conservative Coalition that was at odds with the rest of the Democratic Party.\n\nJohnson's \"Great Society\", desegregation, and pressure from the new left caused the New Deal coalition to fall apart in the mid to late 60's. Nixon's campaign used this to their advantage, picking up alienated conservatives in a Coalition that would later be solidified by Reagan, giving us the dual-party system aligned with the left-right spectrum that we have today.\n\nSo, the democratic and republican parties were not always liberal and conservative respectively. \n\n*************\n\nLet me know if I messed anything up or if something makes no sense.",

However I'll quote some choice pieces. He started out on the surface pretty okay but then he just quickly showed his hand and, well, intellectual dishonesty hardly begins to describe this conversation.\n\n&gt; There is a lot of revisionist history I'm seeing echoed here that only focuses on German strength and none of the massive problems they faced post-war. A lot of modern history on German reparations is written to sell books and get noticed in a saturated field, but is mediocre history at best because of that.\n\nThis is a repeating theme in this thread. Any historian who disagrees is just trying to sell more books! NO WAY anyone could ACTUALLY disagree with him.\n\n----\n\n&gt; You are flat out misrepresenting the situation. Germany had not hard currency to pay as France demanded because of the war expenditures; when France took the last of German gold reserves in the 1921 payment Germany was left to raise gold via printing money because its export markets were taken over during the war by the US or other powers and after the war had tariffs raised against it\n\n....and the German government made absolutely no effort to counteract this with sensible policy but rather encouraged it to spiral out of control deliberately.\n\nThe German government left the war the highest GDP power on the continent. I don't know why you think their entire industrial might was somehow crushed by the Saarland being occupied temporarily.\n\n&gt; Germany did not have hard currency to pay, which the French demanded and when they couldn't provide it the French occupied the country to take by force what they wanted.\n\nThe French occupied the Ruhr in 1924. The Germans did not have the currency to pay the 20 billion gold marks in 1919 and thus used coal shipments and the like to replace it. He's combining two separate occasions. \n\n&gt; Germany was incapable of paying reparations because it lacked exports to raise enough money to pay them and finance its economy.\n\nAnd was the largest GDP on the continent and was the biggest exporter to Britain. Odd.\n\n&gt; The entire problem was caused by the French demanding immediate money regardless of Germany's ability to pay,\n\nThat's an odd thing to say considering the French were quite reasonable about it and took material and stock payment in lieu of demanding cash. He one sentence claims the Germans were forced to inflate their currency to make payments but then turns around and says the French wouldn't accept payments and \"took what they needed\"? What?\n\n&gt; Herwig and Strachan support my point that Germany could not pay and have a functioning economy immediately after the war.\n\nHe takes \"Germany could not front 20 billion marks worth of gold immediately so they gave off material good in lieu\" as \"They did not have a functioning economy and couldn't make standard reparation payments.\" What a nice jump.\n\n----\n\n*in response to Sally Marks' The Myths of Reparations, one of the best sources on this matter in existence:*\n\n&gt; Its a bullshit article. They had not choice but to print money because the French were demanding hard currency that Germany lacked and it simply could not pay its bills.\n\n1. Great start\n\n2. The Germans did not need hard currency, the French were accepting alternative payments\n\n&gt; It was a very bad time and Sally Marks is trying to get noticed in a saturated field by trying to write provocative work.\n\nHere we go again.\n\n&gt; No, I've cited a far better scholarly work \"The Great Disorder\" by an economic historian Gerald Feldman\n\nHahahahah holy crap. Anyone who earnestly makes the argument \"No my source is beeetteeerrrr\" without any qualification is just a class act.\n\n&gt; that traces the economic situation in Germany from 1914-24 and explicitly demonstrates how reparations and the post war situation pushed Germany into hyperinflation.\n\nLet's rewrite this so that it's fact based:\n\nthat traces the economic situation in Germany 1914-24 and explicitly demonstrate how reparations and post war situation *amplified preexisting economic horrors caused by a terrible mismanaging of the war economy* and pushed Germany into hyperinflation *due to their own choices in letting it spiral out of control deliberately to get out of reparations.*\n\nThis is the best kind of armchair historian: I read a single source and am master of all.\n\n&gt; Sally is portraying the lack of payment as a function of German evasion when in fact it was simply that Germany had no means of payment\n\n...of the initial 20 billion mark payment which they used alternative payment in lieu of. Not the standard payments afterward.\n\n&gt; The Germans did not choose to let it spiral out of control, they had no control over the situation\n\nLiterally not true at all.\n\n&gt; they were already in inflation,\n\nCaused by their own doing.\n\n&gt; had the Allies pillage their country (as per Herwig p. 448 of his book on Germany and Austria-Hungary)\n\nThis is where I fuckin lost it, flat out. I have this book. I **told him I have this book.** Yet he still flat out lies about what a passage says. He claims Herwig stated that the Allies occupied and pillaged their country in response to the 20 billion in gold not being available. When in fact, verbatim, on page 448 it states:\n\n\"*To show its good faith, the new German republic was to make an advance payment of 20 billion Marks in gold. But since Berlin lacked the requisite gold, the Allies took payment in kind from existing stocks and current production.*\"\n\nThat's a very odd scenario to depict as \"pillaging.\"\n\n&gt; They didn't have hard currency and couldn't guy it abroad, yet the French demanded it and took goods by force.\n\nWoe upon the French for enforcing the treaty Germany signed in the terms agreed upon.\n\nGermany was 100% fully and completely capable of paying the war debts. They chose not to. They did nothing to stem the tide of their economic collapse purposefully and then when the Mark collapsed they got their reparations reduced just as planned. It's no miracle that as soon as the French threw some weight around the Germans mysteriously could start making full payments on time again.\n\n&gt; What was Germany to do to satisfy French demands?\n\n1. Not sack her own economy deliberately\n\n2. Pay the war reparations in the treaty they were signatories of\n\n&gt; Germany couldn't pay without the economy collapsing; you keep ignoring that fact.\n\nThat isn't a fact.\n\n&gt; It required the US to come in and fix the situation because it was utterly unsustainable for the world economy and Germany, so the US and British forced the French to stop their actions and in return the US would provide the currency they were demanding via loans.\n\nHere's another interpretation:\n\nGermany was throwing a hissy fit that they started an aggressive war, lost, and were forced to pay reparations. Thus they took all their toys home and kicked them around a bit and threw a massive temper tantrum. When their fit started to cost the world economic safety (due to them being the #3 GDP power experiencing growth throughout this all) the British and US got together to inject their economy (not knowing what they were doing was deliberate) to keep the world economy afloat. France meanwhile, within the terms of the treaty, occupied territory to encourage Germany to make good on the treaty of which she agreed to.\n\n&gt; Its funny how the economy of Europe recovered a lot more quickly once the reparations issue was taken care of by US loans\n\nEqually funny how as soon as Rudolf Havenstein was sacked and Hjalmar Schacht was put in charge the economy skyrocketed. Almost like there's some correlation there too!\n\n&gt; Once the French came in and took what Germany needed to export to raise money to produce things, because you cannot simply make goods with what coal Germany had left as the only ingredient, they suddenly couldn't produce\n\nAnd yet the Germans remained the #3 GDP power in the world and the #1 GDP power of continental Europe experiencing economic growth throughout this period.\n\nMysteriously.\n\n&gt; You keep repeating a mantra of Germany could pay when I've demonstrated repeatedly it could not by actually posting cited text.\n\nBy citing quoted text **that did not say what you claimed it said.**\n\n&gt;  It did not have currency and the goods that were seized prevented it from exporting to raise money to pay or make more goods for reparations.\n\n...For the 1919 payment alone.\n\n&gt; You keep lying about Tooze, Strachan, and Herwig\n\nIt's funny how he *never* cites these sources but as soon as I do suddenly he's read them and knows precisely what they say. Then he bungles trying to cite one and loe and behind he falsified what they said and exaggerated it profusely. Makes you wonder what his other sources *actually* say.\n\n&gt; Everyone but the French understood Germany could not afford to pay, the French just didn't want to accept it. Your entire thesis is the French position, while you ignore the assessments of the British and US at the time who were also involved in reparations and just as interested in getting them, but understood Germany could not pay.\n\nThe French were literally evil for enforcing the treaty Germany signed.\n\nThe British and US capitulated because, especially the former, relied upon their exports greatly. A strong Germany was better than a weak one for Britain due to her economy which was in shambles, going from the worlds largest creditor to worlds largest debtor in just 4 years. The French, meanwhile, *needed* those reparations to rebuild her nation and thus were quite prickly about getting them yes.\n\n&gt; Regulators subsequently realized that the German economy could no longer sustain the enormous annual payments, which the Allies had deliberately set at a crushing level.\n\nWithout the knowledge the German economy was not being fixed deliberately.\n\n&gt; The process was inescapable once the occupation started; I don't really care what Marks says about German intentions, far more well regarded works have been done since her writings on the subject that demonstrate that the printing of money as a solution to raise gold started before that and the Ruhr occupation did not cause Germany to print money as a means of resistance\n\n\"Your source don't real because I don't accept it.\"\n\n1. He has yet to name any other source other than that *single* book he has cited. Vague phrases like this just show he has no actual sources to back him up.\n\n2. The deliberate inflating of the economy before the occupation did happen, yes. I never denied this. It was the occupation that ramped it up significantly but it was a trend since 1919.\n\n&gt; The Germans were caught in a position they couldn't win in and did not start printing money to end the occupation.\n\nMaybe they shouldn't have put themselves in the unwinnable position then through shitty economic policies and underhanded tactics?\n\n&gt; Ah, so saying that your favorite author, who published one article to the massive tome that Feldman published on the German hyperinflation decades later with more modern and extensive research, is the end-all-be-all on the subject is just ridiculous\n\nI've cited at least 5 other works by this point in the discussion with him.\n\nBut yes I'm citing a peer reviewed academically credited source that **FELDMAN HIMSELF CITED EXTENSIVELY**. What of it?\n\n&gt; you just keep throwing names out there and say read one article when I've got a huge book on the subject that is more recent and more well regarded than your single article.\n\nI like how he can't stop himself from contradicting himself even within the context of his own sentence.\n\n\"Keep throwing out book names and authors BECAUSE I GOT ONE SINGLE LARGE BOOK AND YOU GOT ONE SINGLE ARTICLE\"\n\nAnyone else notice the contradiction?\n\n&gt; Clearly all you have is your fervent belief that somehow Germany could pay when most of the rest of the world at the time understood it could not.\n\nBecause most of the rest of the world didn't see the censured documents that implicated this until the 1960's.\n\n&gt; Frankly the source I've provided is far more in depth on the issue all the way around and yours is primarily based on 1970s research in the French archives, which was heavily biased. The reality was far more complex.\n\nStrachan's work was written 6 years after Feldman's. Blackbourn's 16. Clarke's 9. Herwig's 17.\n\n--------------\n\nEDIT:\n\nSources!\n\nHew Strachan, *Financing the First World War*\n\nHolger Herwig, *Germany and Austria-Hungary, 1914-1918*\n\nDavid Blackbourn, *History of Germany 1780-1918, The Long Nineteenth Century*\n\nHew Strachan, *The First World War: To Arms!*\n\nSally Marks, *The Myths of Reparations*\n\nAdam Tooze, *The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy*",

These are R5s for a few comments from that forum (that should be solely from May 2015, hence the title) just to skim the surface of the endless pit of nationalist bullshit they have there. It's a bit long, so don't feel obliged to read to the end. \n\n### [WARNING: FORUM HAS PURE BULLSHIT EVERYWHERE](http://www.koreansentry.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=4584&amp;hilit=marxism)\n\nI'll focus only on English-language content directly on the forum, directly relating to history, and posted only on May 2015. No bad history in the Korean language, nor links to youtube or other blogs, nor bad science or bad lingustics.\n\nI'll also consistently use the term \"Manchuria\", which I've heard may be offensive to some people because of connotations with Manchukuo. It is also definitely anachronistic. But the other options are \"Northeast China\" which is even more anachronistic and needlessly confusing in a historic context (i.e. Hebei, not Manchuria, would be northeast China during the Song) or something overly wordy like \"Amur-Liao Drainage Area\" (which I've never heard anyone use anyways).\n\n---\n---\n\n# [Thread 1](http://www.koreansentry.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6139&amp;start=20)\n\n&gt; **Qin never built Greatwall [*sic*] it was built during North Song Dynasty to stop the nomadic incursion into Yellow river**\n\nWell, not quite. I quote from *The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth* by Arthur Waldron:\n\n &gt; It should be clear, first of all, that no \"Great Wall\" anything like our modern conception of it existed in ancient times. Before the sixteenth century, walls in China were of a modest scale, and eroded easily. Furthermore, they followed no single route, but rather a series of different ones, according to the defense needs of the dynasties that built them. One makes sense of them by looking at each against the background of the strategic and political challenges of the dynasty that built it, not by linking them all together into [one] single mystical structure.\n\nSee also [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg) of fortifications in northern China and the steppes further north.\n\nIt's not quite accurate to say that Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall, since its current form in the popular imagination is almost entirely a product of Ming effort. Qin fortifications would have been much less grand, being largely earthen fortifications easy to build, and the Qin built on top of a basis of previously existing networks. But it's simply ridiculous to claim that the *Northern Song* Dynasty built it; the northern fortifications built by the Northern Song were not nearly as comparable to the Ming Great Wall and in fact similar to previous fortifications in the region.\n\n&gt; **Ancient Chinese records indicates ancient Chaoxian (Korean) was made up by Mo [Maek] tribes as well and even Samguk Sagi have passage where Baekje, Gaya and Silla being Mo tribe descendants but some Korean scholars claimed this Mo tribe as Hmong but it wasn't it was the related to Murong Xianbei tribe.**\n\nSome background information for those not acquainted with Korean history. *The History of Korea* by Djun Kil Kim is an awfully short (IMO) but decent English introduction as [our book list says](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/eastasia#wiki_korea) so it's worth a read.\n\n\"Chaoxian\" here refers to [Gojoseon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojoseon), generally considered the first Korean state. Gojoseon's original center of power appears to have been in southwestern Manchuria until they were pushed into northern Korea as a result of Chinese aggression. It was finally conquered by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty in 108 BC, and Chinese commanderies were established over it.\n\nThe next stage in Korean history is the [Proto-Three Kingdoms era](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:History_of_Korea-001.png) when most of the peninsula was dotted by states or alliances between chiefdoms; we know a lot about most of them thanks to Chinese sources.\n\nFrom the third century onwards Korean polities gradually centralized with Chinese influence. [Goguryeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo) expanded into most of southern Manchuria and northern Korea, while the confederations of chiefdoms in southern Korea morphed into full-fledged states, [Baekje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje) in the west and [Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla) in the east. The chiefdoms in the lower [Nakdong River Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakdong_River) remained a comparatively loose confederacy of statelets - known as [Gaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaya_confederacy) - which was eventually completely annexed by Silla in the sixth century. In the seventh century there was generally a balance of power in Korea between the Three Kingdoms - Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla - while the former was involved in grueling wars with Chinese dynasties. Eventually Silla and the Tang Dynasty allied to defeat Goguryeo and Baekje for once and for all, and when Silla [thwarted Tang ambitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla%E2%80%93Tang_War) to directly rule over all of the peninsula and succeeded in retaining its sovereignity as a tributary state of China ruling the southern two-thirds of Korea, the Three Kingdoms Period of Korean history is considered to have come to an end.\n\n\"Mo\" here refers to 貊 or Maek, an ethnic group/ethnic groups inhabiting Manchuria and northern Korea simultaneously with the Han Dynasty and before. We know little for sure about the Maek, and contradictions in Chinese sources don't help. Although there is a general consensus that the Maek were one of the ancestral cultures tp modern Koreans along with other peoples such as the Ye or the Han, the assuredness displayed here that  Gojoseon, Baekje, Silla and Gaya were *definitely* all *completely* Maek is a horribly arrogant position to take especially when much of it is arrogantly...wrong.\n\nChinese records do say that the Maek people were part of the Gojoseon/Chaoxian polity. But much of what's said here about the [*Samguk Sagi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_Sagi) is just plain wrong. As for [Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla) the *Sagi* just says that people from Gojoseon lived in the [Gyeongju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju) Valley prior to the formation of Silla as a state; see here if you read Korean for the primary source. It never actually says that these Gojoseon inhabitants were Maek. I'll try my hand at a non-literal translation of the [original source](http://db.history.go.kr/item/level.do;jsessionid=59027C9BB18FCC5CF24992CA3DAC3830?levelId=sg_001r_0020_0010) with some excerpting:\n\n&gt; The progenitor [of the kingdom] was surnamed \"Bak\" and named \"Hyeokgeose.\" He was crowned in the Bingchen day of April of the Jiazi year or the first year of Wufeng during the reign of the Emperor Xiaoxuan of the Early Han [BC 57] and was called the Geoseogan. His age was thirteen, and he took Seonabeol [cognate with modern Korean *seoul* \"capital\" and *beol* \"field\"] as the name of his country. Prior to this, emigrants from Joseon had formed six settlements in the valleys, and these were called the Six Towns of Jinhan; Yangsan on the Al River, Goheo on Mount Dol, Jinji on Mount Chwi, Daesu on Mount Mu, Gari on Mount Geum, and Goya on Mount Myeonghwal. Sobeol, chieftain of Goheo, looked at the slopes of Mount Yang and saw a horse kneeling and weeping in the bushes besides the Na Well, but when he went the horse was gone and there was a large egg. When he split open the egg there was a baby within. He raised the child and at the age of ten the child was wise and skillful. The people of the Six Towns who had venerated and respected the child for his miraculous birth so made him their king. The Jin[han] people called a squash *bak* and because the egg [he was born in] had been like a squash they gave him \"Bak\" as his surname.^1 Geoseogan in the Jin language means king.\n\nBut what's even more ridiculous is the claim that the *Sagi* says that the Gaya chiefdom/statelet confederation was Maek. Besides the fact that the *Sagi* **hardly discusses Gaya at all**, our actual main source for Gaya myths, the [*Samguk Yusa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samgungnyusa), states the following (my translation to get the gist of it across rather than a literal translation, see the original Chinese and a Korean translation [here](http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE004&amp;cp_code=cp0704&amp;index_id=cp07040013&amp;content_id=cp070400130001&amp;search_left_menu=)):\n\n&gt; Since the creation of the world this land had had no name for a country nor for kings and officials. There were only nine *gan*: the Ado Gan, the Yeodo Gan, the Pido Gan, the Odo Gan, the Yusu Gan, the Yucheon Gan, the Sincheon Gan, the Ocheon Gan and the Shingwi Gan. These chieftains ruled over a hundred towns and 75000 people. Most lived in the mountains and the plains, drinking in wells and tilling the fields. [In 42 AD] there was a strange sound like a call from the Guji Peak north of the land, and two or three hundred people gathered there. They heard a voice like that of a person but without a body. The voice asked, \"Are there people here?\" The nine *gan* replied, \"There are us.\" The voice came again, \"Where am I?\" The nine *gan* replied, \"You are on the Guji Peak.\" The voice said, \"Heaven has made me descend here to found a new country and to be its king. If the next day you dig in the earth top of the peak while dancing and chanting 'Turtle, turtle, take out your head, if you do not take it out we will cook you and eat you' the great king shall come and you shall dance in joy.\" \n\n&gt; The nine did as they said and all danced and chanted. Soon when they looked up on the sky violet ropes fell from the sky and touched the earth. At the end of the ropes there was a golden chest wrapped in crimson cloth. When they opened it there were six golden eggs round as the sun. [...] Twelve days later at dawn many people gathered again to open the chest again and saw that the six eggs had become fair children. [...] The fifteenth of that month they all became kings of Gaya.\n\nWe see from this myth that the Nakdong River Valley was inhabited and ruled by local chieftains or *gan* and that the first Gaya kings are never stated to be Maek individuals - or even humans, for that matter, since they hatched from golden eggs and one of the six supposedly lived to the age of 157. While the myth has been interpreted as symbolic of historic events, nowhere in any primary source does it ever say that the Gaya confederation was composed of \"Maek tribe descendants\".\n\nThe Maek were not Xianbei, Murong or otherwise. The [Xianbei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei) were probably a para-Mongolic people speaking a Mongolic language. The Maek spoke a language belonging to Koreanic or possibly Tungusic or other language groups existing northeast of China. They almost certainly did not speak a Mongolic language.\n\n&gt; **Baekje's Buyong vassal Tammora aka Taiwan**\n\nTammora actually refers to [Jeju island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejudo) (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamna)) and is probably cognate with modern Korean *seomnara* \"island country.\" There is no evidence that Baekje had any sort of influence whatsoever in ancient Austronesian Taiwan. As explained [here](http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/11751/10380) Taiwan was undergoing a peaceful transition to the Iron Age at Baekje's epogee, and most Chinese trade goods discovered on the island date no further back than the Tang Dynasty. There is no evidence that Taiwanese chieftains were vassals to a kingdom far far away, particularly considering their isolation from China, just across the channel.\n\n&gt; **Maek is another name for Balk not Mo**\n\nNo. I don't know what the \"Balk\" even are, and they do not seem to exist based on my google searches. But 貊 is pronounced *mo* in Mandarin and *maek* in Korean, and the Maek are the only people with a name remotely similar to *mo* that played a major role in ancient Korean history. Maybe \"Consoleman\" realized he knew shit about ancient Korea and tried to save face with this.\n\n&gt; **Let's summarize the Gojoseon's location:**\n\n&gt;**1. Shang period - Gojoseon was divided into nine Dongyi nations and stretched far as Shandong**\n\n&gt; **2. Zhou Dynasty period - Gojoseon was at Hebei-Liaoxi-Inner Mongolia**\n\n&gt; **3. Revolt at Hebei region made Gojoseon to relocate to the East, Hebei became control by Xiongnu**\n\n&gt; **4. Yan attacked Donghu and Gojoseon and taken Liaoxi from Gojoseon**\n\n&gt; **5. Han attacked Gojoseon again and re-take control over Liaoxi**\n\n1) There's no evidence for a polity identifiable as Gojoseon that existed in the [Shandong peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_Peninsula) during the Shang period. Now, there *is* evidence that Shandong was inhabited by people their western neighbors saw as [*Dongyi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongyi) or \"Eastern Barbarians\". From *The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age*, emphases mine\n\n&gt; &gt; In the late Shang oracle-bone inscriptions the name \"Renfang\" was used to refer to the region, in south Shandong and north Jiangsu, of alien people whom the Shang kings waged wars. **It is also commonly believed that the characters \"Ren\" in the late Shang inscriptions and \"Yi\" [the second character in the compound *Dongyi*] in Zhou and Han documents refer to the same people, who resided to the east.** Accordingly, peoples identified by the Zhou as residing to the east were also commonly called Dongyi (\"Eastern Barbarian\"). Many Chinese archaeologists often use the term Dongyi to refer to [the Yueshi culture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueshi_culture) **Apparently, these Yi peoples did not belong to a single ethnic group.**\n\nBut KoreaSentry here committed the horrible sin of thinking that \"Dongyi\" was a singular ethnic group that was the ancestor of one modern ethnic group. Dongyi were not Japanese. Dongyi were not Koreans. Dongyi was simply a catch-all term for eastern peoples alien to China, a term that had little regard for cultural, linguistic, or political differences within the Dongyi. For example, a good third of one of the volumes of [*Records of the Three Kingdoms*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Three_Kingdoms) (not to be confused with a later novel of a similar title) is solely about the Dongyi. But these \"Dongyi\" include Tungusic speakers, Koreanic speakers, and Japonic speakers; they include hunter-gatherers, millet farmers, and rice farmers; they include full-fledged kingdoms and loose organizations of chiefdoms. The people who resided in Shandong during Shang days and the people who resided in Korea during Han days were both called *Dongyi*, but all that tells us is that they lived east of \"China\" and that they were considered barbaric, both of which we knew.\n\n2) and 3) There's no archaeological or historical evidence for this. Archaeologically, Gojoseon sites are distinguished by [characteristic \"northern\"^2 dolmen tombs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Korea-Ganghwado-Dolmen-02.jpg) and by distinct bronze daggers. [This map of their distribution](http://i44.tinypic.com/2d53f9.jpg) doesn't seem to be completely accurate, but it should suffice. Here the blue leaf-like shapes represent sites with a large number of bronze daggers, and the grey stone-like shapes are major dolmen complexes. Clearly you should notice that most dolmen complexes are in Korea or southern Manchuria, and that the significant majority of bronze daggers were also found east of the [Liao River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_River). And besides, [the Hai Basin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hai_River_Basin_EN.svg) which is essentially most of Hebei is packed with Shang sites, not Gojoseon sites. Archaeology is completely inconsistent with the claim that Gojoseon was centered west of the Liao.\n\n4) and 5) all derive from 2). But I also want to make a general point about a claim circulating nowadays among nationalist Koreans that in the 7th century BC, the \"Liao River\" referred to the [Luan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luan_River). This is used to \"prove\" that Liaodong in ancient Chinese texts was not [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula) but [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoxi_Province). This is fallacious in many ways. First, the two sources usually given are [an anthology of anecdotes and tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuo_Yuan) and an obscure volume on geography. As aforementioned, archaeology does not support the existence of a significant non-Chinese polity west of the Liao during the Warring States period, while it does support the existence of one *east* of the Liao. And even if we do assume the Luan was called the Liao in the 7th century, *Liao* simply means \"faraway\" and *Liaohe* is literally \"the river faraway.\" Therefore it's only natural that even *had* the Luan been the Liao of the 7th century BC, 400 years later when the Luan region had adjoined the center of [a major Warring State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_State) it makes sense that the river called \"the river faraway\" by that point would have gone further east.\n\nKorean nationalists love using obscure and often contradictory Chinese texts while hardly mentioning archaeological evidence. I'm never sure exactly why.\n\nThese are enough for this one thread, I think. Let's move on to another one...\n\n---\n\n^1 Although *bak* does indeed mean \"squash\" in modern Korean and presumably Old Korean as well, this etymology is probably wrong. The surname *Bak*, more familar to most people as \"Park\", probably derives from the word for \"bright\" which in early modern Korean was *balgda* with the *-da* being a verbal suffix.\n\n^2 \"Northern\" dolmen tombs have been found on the southernmost parts of the Korean peninsula, vice versa for \"southern\" dolmen tombs. \n\n---\n---\n\n# [Thread 2](http://www.koreansentry.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6212)\n\n## OMG THE CHINESE ARE \"BASTARDIZING\" CHINESE HISTORY\n\n&gt; **He was claiming that Kublai Khan attacked China and taken control over Beijing and northern states and I was little confused as when Kublai Khan seized control over Beijing, this city was already occupied by Jurchen Jin Dynasty not Chinese dynasty and Chinese Song Dynasty was at far south when this happened.** \n\nAlright. Both the drama and \"Consoleman\" are egregiously wrong because Genghis Khan had already conquered the city of Zhongdu (what would later be Beijing) decades before Kublai Khan was already born. When the Jin emperor moved south to the city of Kaifeng, defended by the Yellow River, the former Jin capital of Zhongdu was quickly besieged by Genghis. After several failed attempts to breach the defensive walls of the city the Mongols decided to let Zhongdu starve to defeat. The commander of the Jin forces fled to join his emperor in Kaifeng in June 1215, and soon after it fell to the Mongols. This is a basic event of Genghis's conquests and it's incredible that the moderator of a forum supposedly about East Asian history doesn't know about this.\n\n&gt; **It seems Chinese are trying to paint Liao, Jin and Yuan Dynasty as Chinese dynasties.**\n\nFor those not versed in Chinese history, the [Liao Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty) was founded by the initially nomadic Khitan people and ruled much of the steppes north of China as well as parts of northern China. The [Jin Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_dynasty) was founded by Jurchens who were Tungusic and lived in Manchuria; after taking over most of the Liao the Jurchens invaded the Song Dynasty to the south and conquered most of northern China. The [Yuan Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty) was founded by the Mongols after their conquest of all of China, including the Song Dynasty which had relocated south after the Jurchens. I recommend the fantastic *Imperial China 900-1800* by Frederick W. Mote.\n\nFirst, [*History of Liao*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liao), [*History of Jin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jin) and [*History of Yuan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Yuan) all belong to the classic [Twenty-Four Histories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-Four_Histories). So the Chinese clearly thought of them as part of Chinese history centuries before Korean nationalism even identifiably existed.\n\nLet's begin with the patrons and founders of Liao temples. They include names such as Li Yanchao (possible patron of the Geyuan Temple), Jiao Xiyun (founder of the Fengguo Temple) or Wang Wenxi (helped build the Guangji Temple). These are all rather typical Chinese names, rather than Mongolic Khitan names. On the celebrated Liao-era architecture Dieter Kuhn has this to say:\n\n&gt; Theoretically, the imperial Qidan [Khitan] may have emerged as \"geniuses in the making of their own architectural tradition\"; but practically they most probably had to rely on their Chinese architects and builders, who were able to translate their religious conceptions and political aspirations into three-dimensional architectural structures of great complexity.\n\n[source](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4528851)\n\nThe Khitan themselves, especially in the southern Liao territories, were adopting more of the trappings of Chinese civilization. The following are all quotes from *History of Liao* with Mote's translation\n\n&gt; This was the system of Liao: during [937 - 945] the emperor and the officials of the Southern Region dressed according to Chinese style [while those in the Northern Region did not]\n\n--\n\n&gt; [In 941] On the day *bingzhen* ... it was decreed that Khitan individuals who held Chinese offices [i.e. offices in the Southern Chancellory] were to follow Chinese customs and might intermarry with Chinese.\n\n--\n\n&gt; After [983] at big ceremonies even officials of the third rank and above in the Northern Region also wore Chinese clothes. After [1032] at big ceremonies all dressed in the Chinese style.\n\n--\n\n&gt; In  [994] it was decreed that Khitans who had committed one of the ten grave crimes should also be sentenced according to [Chinese] law.\n\nThese quotes might give the impression that the Khitan were wholesale Sinicized. The Liao empire and the Khitan civilization were distinctly multicultural and hybrid, and the Khitan themselves tried and preserved their old steppe traditions particularly towards the north. But the Liao Dynasty was a society with a large Chinese population that had embraced a number of Chinese traditions, their emperors called themselves *huangdi* and took on imperial language such as the throne name or the temple name, and their legacy - artistic, political, and otherwise - would linger on in the region and continues in China today. It perfectly deserves to be called a Chinese dynasty.\n\nContinuing on to the Jurchen Jin Dynasty. Like the Liao that they had defeated, after their conquest of northern China the Jurchens began to adopt Chinese customs. Just from a political/legal viewpoint, the Jin government in Zhongdu was largely Chinese by the late 12th century, complete with [the Six Ministries system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Departments_and_Six_Ministries) and [the Nine-rank system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-rank_system), although the functioning and classification of a number of governmental posts differed (and the Jin court had some offices that lacked prior precedent in China). From 1123 onward the Jurchens had [civil service examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination) and by the 1180s they were using them on a massive scale. The Jin law code in 1202 copied half of its ordinances from the Chinese code of the Tang Dynasty. Or culturally, too - by 1150 traditionally Jurchen literary forms were dying out while Chinese styles were flourishing among the Jurchen elite of Zhongdu. The Jin [Emperor Xizong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xizong_of_Jin) was taught by Confucian scholars, and he became a classical Chinese scholar-gentleman, trained in Chinese poetry, Chinese calligraphy, and Chinese (Confucian) rites. After his coronation \"he was served by Confucian ministers\" and was apparently rather contemptuous of the old and conservative Jurchen individuals of the court. [Prince Hailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Hailing_of_Jin) inherited and continued the Sinicization policies. While Hailing's successor, [Emperor Shizong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shizong_of_Jin), campaigned to bring back the old Jurchen ways, Shizong's Crown Prince did not even properly know the language! While Shizong's grandson and successor, [Emperor Zhangzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Zhangzong_of_Jin), knew Jurchen, Shizong notes that \"I have ordered all the princes to learn the language of the dynasty; only Prince Yuan [Zhangzong] has studied it to any great extent.\" \n\nAgain, you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking the Jurchen were completely Sinicized; after all, the Jin empire existed for less than a dozen decades. For an example, the Jin code I mentioned allowed the practice of [levirate marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage) (marrying the brother's widow) which was considered barbaric and almost incestual by the Chinese while it was a long-standing tradition in the steppe, practiced since the days of the Xiongnu or earlier. But there *was* a general trend of adopting more of Chinese culture among the Jurchens. And of course the Jurchens, like the Liao, used imperial language. (a great anthology of essays and essays on Jurchen Jin history is *China Under Jurchen Rule: Essays on Chin Intellectual and Cultural History*) \n\nAs for Yuan I know a lot less, but I do know that the Mongol emperors used imperial language and *at least* the basic outline of Chinese government formats, and, obviously, they ruled all of China. Not to mention that their Ming  successors recognized them as having been a legitimate dynasty.\n\nThere is a general misconception about the nature of [\"conquest dynasties\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_Dynasties) from Korean nationalists, probably abetted by the fact that a thing remotely similar to a conquest dynasty has never existed in the past millennium of Korean history. Many Koreans seem to view the Jurchen-Han relationship in the Jin Dynasty or the Manchu-Han relationship in the Qing as some sort of colonial relationship. This could not be further detached from reality. The Khitans or the Xianbei or the Manchus or the Jurchens adopted Chinese government, traditions, even language. Their societies were often hybrid, but they really have full right to be called a Chinese dynasty.\n\n&gt; **Chinese sino-centric view of their neighbors stopped after Qin Dynasty.**\n\nIf this was the case I want an explanation as to why [Wang Fuzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Fuzhi) thought it was okay to deceive \"barbarians\" while doing the same thing to the Chinese was obviously not. While I don't have the full quote at hand, in one of his works Wang says something to the point of \n\n&gt; It is not against [*ren*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/Rén) for China to decimate the barbarians; it is not against [*xin*](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/philosophy_east_and_west/v061/61.3.wee.html) for China to deceive the barbarians; it is not against [*yi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi#Other) for China to take and farm the land of the barbarians. It is *ren* that China decimate them to protect her people; it is *xin* that China deceive them and see them as malign; it is *yi* that China take their land to strengthen her people. \n\nRead that and tell me that Sinocentristic outlooks on the world died after the 3rd century BC. Besides I also want an explanation as to some of the wording of [this letter](http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/2c/texts/1792QianlongLetterGeorgeIII.htm). I want an explanation as to why the Korean^1 court agreed that barbarians have no concept of *li* or ritual. In other words, I want an explanation to a lot of things I know to be true about East Asian history. \n\n&gt; **Chinese also need to remember that notion of \"China\" did not existed prior to 1912.**\n\nI'll just quote from Wang Fuzhi, who I introduced earlier as a 17th-century scholar vehemently against the Manchu and other barbarians (source is *The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China*, but I'm tweaking a few words^2):\n\n\n&gt; There are two great barriers in the empire: [the first is the barrier between] Chinese and barbarians, [and  the second is that between [*junzi* and *xiaoren*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junzi)] [.....] the barbarians, with respect to the Chinese, are born in alien lands. As their lands are alien, their customs are alien, so their behavior is entirely alien.\n\nWang Fuzhi clearly distinguishes \"China\" (*Huaxia*) from \"barbarians\" (*Yidi*). In fact, concepts such as 中華 *zhonghua* 中國 *zhongguo* or 華夏 *Huaxia*, all translated in English as \"China,\" as a entity differentiated from her foreign neighbors is a virtually ancient one, mentioned in texts such as *The Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\n&gt; **There's no historical proof of that bullshit claim [that 'Phags-pa is related to Hangul]**\n\nWell, no. There's a number of misconceptions about Hangul often found in the general Korean public. These include more reasonable ones such as \"Sejong independently invented the concept of an alphabet\", to more hardcore idiotic ones such as \"Hangul is the only script with a known creator,\" to completely inane ones like \"Hangul is actually the oldest script in the world!\" I don't think public education about Hangul in Korea is helping.\n\nI'm not a linguist and I haven't bothered to read up much on the origin of the Hangul alphabet, but [the connection between a number of Hangul elements and a number of 'Phags-pa elements](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phagspa-Hangul_comparison.svg), as well as other alphabets, is well-established at this point. I quote from *Rethinking East Asian Languages, Vernaculars, and Literacies, 1000–1919*\n\n&gt; Elements of the new Korean script not only drew from Chinese rhyme tables, dictionaries, and phonological scholarship but also demonstrated awareness of alphabetic scripts used in the Mongol Empire, such as the Mongol-Uighur script, 'Phags-pa, and the Tibetan script.\n\nWhile the innovative spirit represented in Hangul is worthy of applause, it's historically dishonest to claim that Hangul is an independent invention. \n\n&gt; **Khitan left China long ago and established another nation and their descendants are called Kazakhstan.  There's even Yuchi's descendants called Uyghurs**\n\nAs mentioned above, the Para-Mongolic-ness of Khitan is widely accepted. Meanwhile we know that the Kazakh language is a Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak subfamily. Despite the Altaic hypothesis, no verifiable genetic connection between the Turkic and Mongolic languages have been confirmed. Kazakhs speak a fundamentally different language from the old Khitans. Sure, there are probably a few things that the Turkic peoples of the central steppes learned from Khitans or Kara-Khitans (I wouldn't know) but that's like saying that the English are \n\nThe Uyghurs cannot be the descendants of the [Yuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuchi), because the Yuchi are an indigenous people of the Eastern Woodlands originally living in what is now Tennessee. Assuming this person meant [*Yuezhi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuezhi), not Yuchi, the Yuezhi are [believed to be Indo-European speakers](https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/notes13.html) while the Uyghurs are a Turkic people. Again the Yuezhi language during Han times had nothing to do with what Uyghurs in Xinjiang speak now.\n\n---\n\n^1 Yes, Korean, but the Joseon court increasingly became more Neo-Confucian than the Chinese themselves, and the philosophical tenets of the particularly later Joseon court is reflective of orthodox Neo-Confucianism in China as well. There was actually a sentiment that Korea had inherited civilization from the Ming after the *orangkae* (rather antiquated word for \"barbarians\" in Korean, here it refers to the Manchu) conquered China; this is reflected really well in one manifestation in *1881*, more than two centuries after the Manchus had taken Beijing, as a response to the government's failure to persecute Christianity. My translation of excerpts:\n\n&gt; What makes people different from mere beasts or birds? It is the nature to respect the five fundamental principles and five moral disciplines, the nature to reject barbarity and follow [Chinese] civilization [.....] For three hundred years [Beijing had fallen to the Manchus 257 years before] China has been underwater, the four seas have yellowed and dirtied. But one remnant of the spring lingers on alone in the east, like a great fruit high in the air that shows that the force of life still remains on the tip of the branches in a world subsumed by death. The world adores it; the people depend it on it dearly. Shall you take even this away and leave a world of only darkness and no light?\n\n^2 They translated [君子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junzi) *junzi* as \"superior people.\" Like many Chinese concepts *junzi* is a tricky word to translate, but it has no connotations of inherent superiority that the English term \"superior people\" brings with it, and is really a direct antonym to 小人 *xiaoren* meaning \"petty-minded person, narrow-minded person\". For consistency I changed the translation of *xiaoren* back into Chinese too.\n\n---\n---\n\n# [Thread 3](http://www.koreansentry.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6166&amp;start=30)\n\nNow this whole thread is a masterpiece of /r/badlinguistics. Korean absolutely has other dialects and [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language) of the so-called dialects, spoken on an island off the south of Korea called Jeju, is really a separate language (unfortunately we're probably witnessing the final generation of the Jeju language). However there was one epic bad history/anthropology in it: \n\n&gt; **I believe Jeju and Ryukyu people are same people just that two were influenced by two different people**\n\nWhat? First, the Jeju dialect/language is distinctly Koreanic, with most words cognate with the mainland Korean. There are large numbers of Chinese loans and some Mongol loans, both to be expected (the Yuan Dynasty directly controlled Jeju for three generations and there were at least a few Mongols living there) but the basic vocabulary, the grammar, and the phonology are all Koreanic. There are some phonemes that do not have cognates in modern Korean such as the *arae a* (/ɒ/ afaik) but they all derive from Middle Korean. Not unlike the relationship between Scots and English, actually. By contrast, [the Ryukyuan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages) are all Japonic and show evident affinities to Japanese. A simple table with some oversimplifications (source for Okinawan is [this](http://www.jlect.com/search.php?r=&amp;h=&amp;k=&amp;l=okinawa) and source for Jeju is *표준어로 찾아보는 제주어 사전*)\n\n\n| English   | Standard Japanese   | Okinawan    | Standard Korean    | Jeju  \n|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------|  \n| Mother |  Haha | Ayaa  | Eomeoni  | Eomeong \n| Mountain | Yama | Mui | San   | Oreum\n| Hand | Te | Tii | Son | Son\n| Today | Kyo | Kuu | Oneul | Oneol\n| To do  | Suru  | Sun | Hada | Heoda\n\nOr from a less linguistic and more ethnographic perspective, let's compare traditional religious practices in Jeju and the southern Ryukyus, in particular the island of [Yonaguni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonaguni). While there definitely are similarities between the religious practices of the two regions, the former at least (I don't know much in depth about Yonaguni religion) have much stronger similarities to the shamanism of the mainland than to anything on Yonaguni. \n\nFor example, consider the role of the shamans on the two islands. In Yonaguni there is a clear distinction made between female \"priestesses\" (the *k'a* and the *bunai tidigang*) and the shamans (of either gender) called the *juta* or *munuci*, and they serve different roles. But in Jeju, like in mainland Korea, there are no real equivalents to Yonaguni priestesses. (there *is* a role that can be filled only by women, that of the *Samseung Halmang*, but the *Samseung Halmang* is more of a shamanistic midwife/nurse) In Jeju no real supreme deity exists as a major focus of worship, while in Yonaguni the supreme god Tagasa'udi is worshipped. In Jeju the star Polaris is not more a focus of rites than any other star in Ursa Minor, whereas in Yonaguni Polaris is intricately linked to the goddess Ku'udin.\n\n---\n---\n\nTo anyone who actually read the whole thing, well thanks! I hope it was worth reading and not too tedious though it wasn't the best piece of writing you've ever read. Let's wrap this up with a liberally translated quote from a Korean historian of art (hope I don't butcher the translation). He's talking specifically about the exaggerated claims that Baekje was a naval empire, but I think it applies generally to a number of other things:\n\n&gt; In television, novels, even in certain history books, I increasingly frequently encounter the far-fetched claim that Baekje was some sort of ancient maritime empire. I do not pretend not to know how and why these claims have emerged, but they are only hurdles to an accurate analysis of history, because a wrong theory is in the end nothing more than just that - a wrong theory.\n\n&gt; In fact, it is worth a reminder that an important fact is too often forgotten while dealing with [the tomb of Muryeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_King_Muryeong). The artifacts and structure of the tomb closely mimic the tomb style of the Chinese [Liang Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_dynasty). The southward positioning of the bodies, the Chinese-style tomb guardians, the Chinese porcelain cups and vessels, the bronze mirrors based on Han styles, the Chinese Wu Zhu coins, the Liang-style bricks with lotus decorations...all this means that had the royal epitaphs not been found, many scholars would definitely have assumed the tomb to have belonged to some Liang émigré. The scale of this Sinophilia is evident in the very first word of the epitaph where the king is introduced as \"the Great General who Tranquilizes the East,\" a title granted to him by [the Liang emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Liang) that may have been a mark of royal authority. Someone who had thought that Muryeong's tomb was a masterpiece of indigenous Korean culture would definitely be shocked and disappointed if he ever visited the Nanjing Museum.\n\n&gt; These Sinophilic tendencies should be understood in a historic context. Throughout the history of Baekje, active cultural contact with Chinese civilization was limited until the reign of Muryeong. That was when the kingdom finally experienced a global stage and escaped the stagnation of isolation, and it matured through its efforts to follow the general trends of East Asian culture. Koreans should not feel shame at the cultural imitation of the Muryeong reign, but they *should* applaud Baekje's openness and readiness towards change. World history has many examples of collapse urged on by refusals to adopt new ways and traditions. [.....] Thus did Muryeong open up to the world, and with this cultural basis [his son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seong_of_Baekje) could bring about the full splendor of Baekje civilization.",

        "text": "Don't we all just love the French Surrendering Cheese-Monkey stereotype? I mean it takes some serious suspension of belief to claim that the nation that -for the past five hundred years or so- kept most of Europe on it's toes trying to keep them from conquering everyone, is composed of weak and girly soldiers who'd rather sip wine and cheese than fight. As Rudyard Kippling badassesly put, \"Their business is war, and they do their business.\" \n\n\n\nNow the discussion began [here in this lovely thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ao26y/the_only_confederate_flag_that_mattered/) where all sorts ofd badhistory was a'brewing. Given that my new night shift forces me to stay up to maintain my sleep schedule on my weekends, and with nothing to do but drink all night (thanks to my buddy working security at the liquor store) I delved into the darkness to see what fetid scraps of meat I could peel off the dank inner walls.\n\n\n\nOf course French flag jokes abounded and it was only a matter of time before I ran across [this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ao26y/the_only_confederate_flag_that_mattered/cseibgi)\n\n\n\nSo I decided to see how far this rabbit whole went, and in the exchange eventually found something that really rustled my jimmies. \n\n\n\n[\"The allies won and forced the Germans into some humiliating terms mostly due to English and American armies. The French still had a semblance of a resistance yes but nothing to amount to a hill of beans\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ao26y/the_only_confederate_flag_that_mattered/csejneb)\n\n\n\nOkay, no. The French took staggering losses in WWI but that was rule of the day for all sides. Generals on all sides were basically trying to learn the steps to an entirely new kind of war that involved some of the most destructive inventions known to man so of saying the French lost because of heavy casualties is like saying someone lost a waterfight because they got soaked. \n\n\n\nAnd a *semblance of resistance?* Did the [Battle of the Marne](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=First_Battle_of_the_Marne) slip our minds here when the (mostly) French army stopped the German advance decisively? Or the [Goddamned Battle of Verdun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun) which doesn't even need explanation? What about the French-lead [Second Battle of the Marne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Marne) where the French decisively beat the Germans and basically kicked off the allied advance? Jesus Christ, saying that French resistance in WWI 'didn't amount to of a hill of beans' makes my blood fucking boil. France suffered more than almost any other allied nation besides Russia during the First World War and without them Germany likely would've achieved her goals. \n\n\nSome smaller quabbles as well.\n\n\n\n[\"All I'm saying is if you get invaded and occupied... that's a loss.\n\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ao26y/the_only_confederate_flag_that_mattered/csek2uu)\n\n\nBy this logic the Soviet Union lost to Germany because they were invaded and occupied. \n\n\n\n&gt; Germany couldn't completely occupy russia. Mother nature saved them. Don't invade Russia in the winter... just dont.\n\n\n\nI mean the decisive Battle of Kursk was fought in the summer, but General Winter never takes a break I guess.\n\n\n\nI'll end this with some more kickass quotes about the French army.\n\n\n*\"The French soldiers are grand. There is no other word to express it.\"*\n\n\n - Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\n*\"...and a certain unconscious brutality of hurry and gesture in the men is related to their inexhaustible and extraordinary military courage. (...) Let a fool hate France.\"*\n\n\n- G.K Chesterton",

The SS were a explicitly Roman Catholic organization.\n\n\n\n\nI'll just completely, entirely ignore the first sentence because this has been disproven several times on this sub. However, the second assertion was one I've not seen before, and so it interested me. After some research, I've found absolutely nothing to hint that the SS was a Catholic organization. The closest I've found was this: When Himmler was given control of the group and proceeded to aggressively expand and drastically change its structure, he took inspiration from several places, including the Knights Templar, the Italian Blackshirts, and especial inspiration from the Society of Jesus' absolute devotion and loyalty to the Pope, the Pope being replaced with our good friend Adolf.\nHistorical Accuracy: 2/10\nAlmost completely off base, this comment has absolutely no foundation. Its only redemption is that if you really, really hate the Catholic Church and you have a point to make, you can probably do the mental gymnastics to turn it into a Catholic organization because its innovator's inspiration from the Knight's Templar and SoJ.",
