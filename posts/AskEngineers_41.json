Advice from my fellow woodworkers is that enclosing the dust collector (DC) in a sealed box and venting this box outside is the most effective way to minimise dangerous dust in the workshop. \n\nI have a 2-hp, single stage dust collector, with a claim of 1200cfm of HVLP airflow (link here if you want to see a picture/read the specs - https://www.carbatec.com.au/dust-extractor-2hp-old-code-fm-300).\n\nI will have this unit inside the shed, but it will be in a sealed box. The intake for the DC will come in through a hole in this box and then the DC will vent via the filter bag into the box. Obviously the box itself needs to vent outside the shop with a sufficient sized hole to not impact the performance of the machine (ie all the work the motor does should he sucking air in, not having to push it out of the sealed box).\n\nHow do I calculate the size that this hole needs to be to vent outside? The intake is 125mm in diameter and flow rate is 1200cfm. \n\nFurther, I assume the hole is going to be pretty big (like at least double the intake) but I would rather have lots of smaller holes than one giant hole in the wall. Is there a mathematical way to take a given hole size (say 50mm diameter) and work backwards from there to work out how many 50mm holes are required to get the desired overall effect?\n\nThanks",

I need some help on the theory of the braking system I am designing for the go-kart my university team is manufacturing. I've definitely been overthinking this but I just can't get to the bottom of it. So we're using an inboard braking system with a single disc rotor on the rear axle of a real wheel drive gokart. I was wondering how to do the calculations for the braking force and braking torque required on the brake rotor to stop the vehicle. I have the required deceleration for the vehicle. Should I be considering the entire mass of the vehicle to calculate my braking torque as there is only one brake rotor, or should I only be considering the mass which is supported on the rear wheels, since stopping the rotation of the rear axle effectively only stops the rotation of the rear wheels and the front wheels are left to be stopped by friction.\n\nAnother follow up question is that when the brake caliper applies the frictional force on the brake rotor, does this force also contribute to the bending of the rear axle as well? \n\nIt's honestly quite embarrassing how long I've been stuck at this problem for. Any help or resources that could help point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",

However, I only have 48 credits applied to this degree, so it would be a big setback graduation wise. (This degree is something related to my current field of work, which I enjoy and think pays well.)\n\nOverall, I'm just looking for feedback on this matter and would appreciate any wisdom or input from any others that may have experience in any of these fields or just overall knowledge, experience, or wisdom.",

Efficiency, safety, and cost are major factors. \n\nThere is a book from M.J. Collie, called \"Stirling Engine Design and Feasibility for Automotive Use\" that states\n\n\"Hydrogen is the best because it has the highest thermal conductivity, the lowest viscosity, and a low heat capacity ... However, hydrogen permeates through metals ... On the other hand, helium is inert and can be permanently contained in metal. It has an even lower volumetric heat capacity than hydrogen and almost as good a thermal conductivity, but the viscosity is twice that of hydrogen. Michaels showed that a Stirling engine can be designed to use either hydrogen, helium, or nitrogen all with the same efficiency for the same temperature. However, the heater, cooler, and regenerator of each engine would be designed quite differently\". \n\nFrom this, hydrogen is out. It's flammable and can escape from metals, no thanks. Helium seems alright, but it is expensive so I'd like to avoid it. I figured nitrogen, argon, or air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% other) are the best options left.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these? I am leaning toward air because building a sealed chamber will be difficult. If there were any seals they won't last forever and leaks are inevitable. With air, at least I wouldn't have to refill with a particular gas, or if any internal parts break I can just crack it open and fix them. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea how much efficiency I would lose with pressurized air vs nitrogen or argon. I know there is a massive amount of variables. I am just looking for general ideas/info. \n\nI'd be open to liquids as well but it seems many would just exponentially increase drag.",

        "text": "I saw \\[this video\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y4QGFte3T8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y4QGFte3T8)) the other day about a solar powered train, and was wondering about whether something similar could be done with cars/trucks, so I did a little back of the envelope calculation. I made a few rough assumptions:\n\nAssume 4 square meters of surface area for the solar panels (which seems reasonable for a car that's 4 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, with solar panels on the rooftop, hood, and trunk thus covering 2/3rds of the upwards facing surface area of the car).\n\nAssume the average angle of the sun to the solar panels during the day is only 22.5°. I got this number by assuming the solar panels would be roughly flat and facing the sky directly upwards. Then i took the highest elevation of the sun in the sky at on the equinox at the 45th parallel, which is 45°, and I decided to approximate that the average height of the sun in the sky would be roughly half of this height. Which seems reasonable to me. Half the days would have the sun reach a higher maximum height and half would reach a lower maximum height, and assuming that the average angle is half the maximum angle seems reasonable to me, so, for someone living on the 45th parallel (which is the line of latitude halfway between the poles and the equator, is the approximate latitude of cities like Portland and Toronto, and forms Wyoming's northern border for reference), this seems like a reasonable assumption. For someone from Los Angeles this same reasoning gives an average angle of the sun as 28°, and for someone living on the equator it gives an average angle of 45°. \n\nI don't know how to calculate the true average, and the 45th parallel is pretty far north so I feel like even if this is an over estimate much of the country is further south anyway)\n\n considering I don't want to figure out how to do the calculus to figure out what the average height would actually be, plus 45th parallel is pretty far north anyways).\n\n1300 watts of energy in a square meter of sun.\n\nAverage of 2500 hours of sunlight a year (which seems reasonable according to this \\[source\\]([https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-state-sunshine.php](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-state-sunshine.php)) which gives the average annual hours of sunlight for a bunch of US cities, and tends to range from around the low 2000s to the mid 3000s.) \n\nAssume 75% efficiency rate of the solar panels, \n\nCar is in the sun 75% of the time (to account for time that the sun is blocked by buildings, driving through tunnels, next to mountains, parked indoors, etcetera).\n\nThe math:\n\n4m\\^2 \\* tan(22.5) (accounts for average angle of sunlight in the sky) \\* 1300 watts/m\\^2 \\* 2500 hours \\* 0.75 (solar panel efficiency) \\* 0.75 (percentage of time that the car would be in direct sunlight during daylight hours) ÷ 1000 (to convert watt hours to kilowatt hours) = 3030 KWH/year.\n\nThis would be enough to charge a Tesla Model model 3 standard range (battery capacity of 50kWh) about 60 times!!!\n\nWhy would a consumer not want that? Who wouldn't want effectively have 60 free charges per year to save money? It wouldn't replace the need to charge the car from the grid of course, but even if the car needs 365 full charges every year (which would be a fuckton), that's the equivalent 16% fewer charges needed annually. In other words, even in an extreme case where a car needs a full charge every single day the solar charging could provide about 15% of that power. For half a charge a day, the solar panels could provide 30% of the cars annual power. \n\nThis is of course, a rough estimate. But I think my assumptions are reasonable, especially considering that I'm assuming an average angle of sunlight of only 22.5°, which would low for many parts of the world, I'm assuming that the panels only generate power during my assumed 2500 sunlight hours (which is not true considering that they would probably continue to be able to generate limited power in cloudy conditions) and only when in direct sunlight (once again, assuming that generation drops to 0 when in the shade which of course it wouldn't). It's also worth noting that most americans live south of the 45th parallel which I used to calculate the average angle of the sun, and that many parts of the country get far more then the 2500 hours of annual sunlight I assumed, and that many cars would actually spend more then my assumed 75% of daylight hours in direct sunlight. \n\nIf we look at someone living in Los Angeles, where I know from experience electric cars are very popular, and which has a latitude of 34° and 3246 hours of sunlight a year, then a car could generate 5039 kWh per year, enough to charge a Tesla model 3 100 times annually. For Seattle (latitude 47.6° and 2170 hours of sunlight per year) the charging potential would be 2461 kWh, still enough for 49 full charges of the 50 kWh battery.   \n\nI did the math for an 18-wheeler as well. Assuming 45 square meters of sunlight (Average 18 wheeler in USA is 72 ft long and 8.5 feet wide, with the trailer being 50 feet long. Assuming 100% of the trailer's upwards facing surface area can be used and half of the trucks' upwards facing surface area can be used, that's an area of 510 square feet or 48 square meters, so I feel like 45 square meters is reasonable), then that would generate 34,000 kWh per year, enough to charge the Tesla Semi's 500 kWh battery pack 68 times per year. Assuming a full charge a day that's still about 18% savings.\n\nI know that the solar panels of course would add a not insignificant cost, but as long as the money saved from generating free power over the life of the vehicle is more then the additional cost of the solar panels, it would make financial sense to opt for that feature, especially for fleet vehicles where total lifetime cost is a major concern (i.e. semi trucks, city buses, etcetera). Not to mention, it would also act as a range booster, as it would allow the car to trickle charge while driving when conditions were better, thus allowing your long summer roadtrip drives to go a bit further between charges.",

        "text": "Non-engineer here, and I just watched this youtube video called [Stroads are Ugly, Expensive, and Dangerous (and they're everywhere)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM). Link = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM)\n\nThe TLDR (as best as I can explain) of the video is: Northern America is full of things called \"Stroads\" which are a combination of streets and roads, but are bad at being both. The U.S. and Canada should instead model their roads on the Netherlands model where their cities are full of Fast roads, slow streets, and safe bike lanes, and ultimately this is faster and safer than the American Stroad model.\n\nMy questions are...\n\n1. Is this video exaggerating how bad American Stroads are and how good Netherland roads and streets are? Or is their assessment pretty much correct?\n2. Would a netherlands style road system even be possible in the US? I've lived in Utah my whole life and to get anywhere you basically have to own a car. And not necessarily because utah cities and towns cater the most to cars (although they do), but because the distances between cities and towns are large enough that getting to work on a bike or by foot isn't terribly feasible (in my opinion). Meanwhile in the Netherlands and Europe it seems like everything is much closer together, making non-car ownership and travel feasible there, but not here.\n3. If U.S. Cities did decide to switch to the netherlands model and turn all or most of their 'Stroads' into streets/roads/bike-roads how would or should they go about it from an engineering perspective? Is it kind of too late at this point because it would take too much money and time to completely redo our gigantic American road system?\n\nI'm not an engineer so I'm really just curious what the experts have to say about this whole issue.",

Specifically, I'm not referring to a clustered array of many microphones that only give direction of arrival, instead I'm talking about a spread-out microphone array, similar to the ShotSpotter system. Many paper mentions puzzling jargons like \"general cross correlation\" or \"cross correlation\", \"Maximum Likelihood\" and \"Phase Transform (PHAT)\" prefilter,  but none really explains the concept well. I see that cross correlation is a technique used to compare the similarity between 2 signals, but how exactly does that help with TDOA? The entire idea of TDOA is that we leverage the difference in arrival time to solve for the source location. But if we align all the audio signals using cross-correlation, doesn't that defeat the purpose of TDOA, because each microphone's signal should be slightly shifted? A challenge for real world TDOA system is that the microphones must be time synchronized. Does cross-correlation play a role in helping to solve this issue?",

        "text": "TL;DR It’s an over-the-boot “sock” made of steel chainmail that you slip your booted foot into. Presumably this chainmail sock would be fully chainsaw proof, allowing you to wear them with any work boot and thus saving you from needing to buy a $500+ pair of high quality chainsaw safety boots (that aren’t fully chainsaw proof anyway). Engineers: is this practical? Can it be done? Has it been done? Can someone capable take this idea to the market? Is it dumb?\n\nI’ve got an idea for a product that I wish existed but have none of the expertise necessary to actualize it. Put simply, it’s a steel chainmail sock that is designed to go over your work-boot and protect you from accidentally cutting your foot or ankle while working with a high-powered chainsaw. In my (uneducated) mind, chainmail seems like it would be totally resistant to getting cut thru by a chainsaw. I imagine it working like a sock that you just slip your boot into and tighten with a strap of some sort just above your ankle. \n\nIt’s quite difficult to find a good quality, safe and reliable chainsaw safety boot for an affordable price. The best quality boots of this type on the market can easily go for $400 - $600 and the worst part is that none of them are actually chainsaw proof. Chainsaws still cut right thru them like butter and threaten to injure you despite the high price tag. With this chainmail boot sock (if it works), you would be able to wear whatever work boot you own already and actually protect your feet (presuming the chainmail actually is chainsaw-proof) for presumably a fraction of the cost of the highest quality chainsaw safety boot.\n\nNow, if a product like this already exists, please point me in the direction of it so I can buy it for myself. This is just an idea that came to me out of the need for something like it. I don’t care to be the inventor of this, I just want it in my life.",

        "text": "ME here. I've worked for a company for over ten years specializing in vehicle brake design. During that time, I worked on many dFMEAs with various teams. Thing is, the braking industry isn't advancing at such a rapid pace that dFMEAs need to be completely overhauled. So, every dFMEA I'd worked on was usually just a copy of a previously existing one that might require some small adjustments and tweaks to meet different customer desires or address any special/new features of the brake. But the core components, functions, failures, etc., were largely the same. \n\nThat said, I'm very familiar with dFMEA, but have never had to construct one from the ground-up. I recently took a new job opportunity switching product lines from brakes to powertrain and driveline components (PTUs, differentials, transfer cases). This new company is smaller than my previous one, and the team I'm on is relatively new for them (Systems Engineering role). \n\nAs such, they don't have a great dFMEA for their products already. The products of the team I'm working for are relatively \"new\", or at least different enough that old dFMEAs don't carry over. So, it's looking like I will have to essentially construct the dFMEA for these new products almost from the ground up. \n\nHaving never done this before - is there a methodical way to go about it, to ensure that nothing gets missed or overlooked? Obviously I will have a team working with me, and seniors/managers/design and process experts picking it apart. But I still want to be able to put together a reasonably \"good\" document for them to comb through. \n\nIn my head, I'm thinking that going through each component of the final product/assembly, and then addressing each possible thing that could go wrong with it (and how that would have upstream effects on the product) is a good way. Like, take the BOM and go through each piece individually. O-Ring -&gt; oversized -&gt; improper sealing -&gt; fluid leak -&gt; failure to build pressure. Then O-Ring -&gt; undersized -&gt; improper fitment -&gt; mis- or non-assembly, etc.\n\nIs this a reasonable way to attack this? Or are there any other defined and proven methods for constructing a brand new dFMEA? I tried googling a bit but it's not very easy to find what I'm looking for.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hello, I’m wondering if Nikasil is the same as Ni-SiC? \n\nIs my understanding correct, that basically in a bath of Nickel, which is being electroplated to let’s say aluminium, there are also nano particles of silicone carbide, which is so finely spread out that it attaches to the Nickel while it’s being electrodeposited?\n\nIs Ni-SiC the same as the trademarked Nikasil?\n\nI know that it’s a matrix of nickel, which has silicone carbide attached to it, so it’s a composite, but I don’t know more than that.",

What are my options to transfer this power from high to low rpm’s in a simple, reliable, preferably cheap system?",

        "text": "**Background:**\n\nSo I have 5000 volts running across a capacitor. The capacitor is just two aluminum plates separated by a 2mil sheet of kapton (well, actually it's two 1mil sheets of kapton). The capacitor, a multimeter measuring voltage across the capacitor, and a multimeter measuring current are all that's in the circuit.\n\nThe multimeter measuring current is measuring microamps (it has a setting that low) and is wired in series on the ground side of the capacitor. The multimeter measuring voltage has its high voltage positive lead before the capacitor and the ground after the current multimeter. I turn the thing on for about 15 seconds to read values (the values appear to stabilize at around 10 seconds), then I turn it off.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThe current multimeter gives me lower-than-expected current values (\\~1/10th as much), and the value is negative. I'm not as concerned about the lower-than-expected values as I am about the negative values. It's not broken; I tested it out with a 9V and a handful of MOhm resistors and got the expected microamp values. The current multimeter leads are not backwards.\n\nAnyone got any ideas? It's for a research project. Thanks.",
