I only needed a few, and it was looking like I would not only have to buy a box of 100, but go to a real electrical supply house to get them. I was going back and forth, searching the shelves, with no luck.\nA lady came into the aisle and was also looking back and forth, clearly not finding what she wanted. We were also trying to find an employee to help us, but again, no luck. I asked what she was looking for, and it was something simple, so I helped her out, and she was on her way.\nAnother customer, an old guy, saw this and remarked that it was nice of me to help her. I asked if he knew where the plastic inserts were, and he said \"oh, I have a lot of those in my truck! Come on out and I'll give you some.\"",

        "text": "So, I am a frequent customer of a certain ride-sharing company with a German name as I cannot afford my own car at the moment and it's a fairly cheap and convenient way to get around. I was on my way home from the gym to go get some food (I put in the restaurant as my destination), and I asked the driver if it would be okay if I went inside for three minutes and ordered my food and then put in my home address when I came back out. Other drivers do this for me ALL THE TIME. Sometimes people need to make pit stops or change their destination. He said, \"Yeah, I do mind actually, and that's pretty rude of you to ask that.\" I couldn't believe his nerve. He was acting like an entitled child. I left a 3-star review and told the company exactly what he did and how rude he was. I shit you not it took LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES for me to order my damn food and receive it. I got a much nicer driver afterward when I requested my ride home, but had to wait an extra 11 minutes for him to get there. Should I contact support or let the issue be? I'm STILL fuming over this. \n\nUPDATE: Contacted the company about the issue and explained how this guy's behavior was unprofessional and childish, and they gave me $5 credit. I work in food service and have been dealing with the public for over 4 years (I'm 22, soon to be 23 in July) and know what it's like to deal with shitty customers, but I would never be rude to a customer for no reason. This was completely inexcusable and I'm glad I got my issue resolved. My driver after him was super nice and polite, thankfully this guy isn't a regular driver I get and I hope to never put up with him again. :) ",

Place my order, get my money ready and wait.    \n\nRoughly 10 minutes after ordering, there's a buzz at my apartment door.  \"Can't be the pizza already\".  But it is.  Cool that was fast.  A little too fast.   \n\nPay the guy and close the door.   I open the box and the top of the pizza looks okay, but once I start to pick up a slice, I can see that it's barely baked at all.   I'm not talking a little undercooked.   This was like raw dough.   I could have scraped off the pizza toppings and made something else with the dough.   \n\nCall the place up and explain, they tell me they'll send  another one.   This time it's 12 minutes.   And yep, just as raw as the first one.   \n\nCall again.   They offer to send another.   I tell them no thanks, I won't be ordering from you again.   \n\nI understand wanting to get food out quickly, but I'm willing to wait a few more minutes if that means you actually bake the pizza.

(On mobile so I apologize for formating ect)\n\nA few years back I worked in a game store located in a mall that had a few competitors that offered the same good. So my birthday was coming up and my mum wanted to buy my Xbox Gold back when I didn't play PC, knowing I was working all the weeks leading up to my birthday she decides to go to a competitor. This part is from her point of view. M-Mother. A-ASSociate.\nM: \"hi there can I please get a Xbox gold card for a year?\"\nA: *scoffs and chuckles* \"You can't BUY Xbox gold in store you need to buy it online by a credit card only.\"\nM: *A little taken aback* \"oh, alright thanks.\"\n\nCome my birthday mum hands me $100 in cash and explains the situation so she couldn't buy my Xbox Gold. Since I worked in a game store and I knew he was talking out his ass I decided it'd be a fine birthday treat to embarrass him for being an ass to my mum. So we take a short drive down and spot him working along with a loyal customer who our store loves and also happens to be his manager. So I happily stride up to the desk with the mother in tow. D- Dude manager Me- me.\n\nMe: *speaking to A* \"Can I get one year of Xbox Live?\"\nA: *in the same arrogant tone* \"Hi, I already told her *points to mum* that you can't buy Xbox Gold in store you ne-\n*I cut him off*\nMe: \" I know what you said. And how you said it, but I also know you're wrong. I'd like to speak to your manager, please. \"\nA: *chuckles* OK he'll just tell you the same thing. *shouting* Hey Dude manager, this guy would like to speak to you!\"\nD: \"Oh what's up lemonbarbarian, why you shopping here instead of [Game store where I work]\nMe \"Not much, Dude Manager, mum was embarrassed by this guy when she asked for Xbox Gold, he told her you can only buy it by credit card online.\"\nD: *looks angry as fuck at A* \"Lemon Barbarian would like Xbox Gold, A. Get it for him and apologize to M.\"\nA: *looking like a deer in headlights* \"But we don't sell Xbox Gold you can onl- *D cuts him off with a hand in the face and reaches under the desk right in front of A placing an Xbox Gold card in front of him.*\nD: \"One Xbox Gold, A.\"\n\n*A runs the transaction and hands me the card sheepishly.*\n\nD: \"Refund the card, and and do it again. If I recall I said Apologize to M.\"\n\n*A runs the transaction again and this time offers it to Mum.*\n\nA: \"Sorry ma'am for the inconvenience, here's the card.\"\nD: \"it WASN'T an inconvenience. It was you making a mistake. Apologize for that.\"\nA: \"I'm sorry for the mistake, ma'am, here's the card.\"\n\nI smile at D and nod, he nods back and smiles as we walk off I hear D say to A.\nD: \"One more slipup like that A. One more time I hear from a customer that you were being a C**T and you're out.\"\n\nGod bless ya D. Gave him staff discount next time he came in.",

I don't work in retail and never have though I do deal with society en masses on vacation and that's enough for me.\n\nAnyhow I went to a store in the mall not too long ago. This is probably the only store on my \"do not shop from\" list. You know those annoying customers that shout \"I'll never shop here again?\" Well.. I'll never shop at this store again though I didn't scream that and march out the store knocking over racks of clothing. \n\nHere's why... The store is an average clothing store; nothing special about it. Not an factory outlet, nor sells pricey one use items like bridal/prom dresses that have a rep for being returned. Just an average store with no huge sale going on. They have things on sale but we're talking a small section.\n\nSo I grab a halter vest I figured I could use for a cosplay since I don't see many around. It wasn't on sale. So I go up to the register and the lady just goes \"no returns\" instantly snips off the tags at the register. So I'm just thinking 'well maybe they just have a store-wide no returns policy.' A little odd but not my decision. I walk out and dig through my bag for the receipt to read the back since usually return policies are outline there. Sure enough....\n\n**return policy**\n\n**Clothing must be returned unworn with tags in place within 30 days of purchase**\n\nWell gee. Good thing I had no problems with my top but I found it super shady the register lady said no-returns and cut the tags there only for the receipt to have the return policy.\n\nI know of sale items that usually can't be returned but even then I've never had someone immediately cut the tags on me like that.\n\nWhat could be an explanation for that?\n\n\n\n\n",

I can't pay for these?\" and she said, \"You'll have to wait about 10 minutes.\" I gave her the dirtiest look I could muster this morning and added my drink and snack to the other woman's things and walked out. \n\n\nThis happened about an hour ago and I'm still bewildered.

I have a lot of sympathy for people I see working in a similar job if they are being complained at/done wrong. \nI was on line at a store once that sells various items, but mostly clothing. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and a small line had begun to form. There were two cashiers at the wrap desk and one of them was doing a return where the customer didn't think to pull out her receipt until she was told. Of course she had to practically dump her bag out to get it. \nIn front of my a lady starts complain to another customer, who sort of nods her head - but this lady can't read social queues apparently - she just keeps going! \"People come here on their lunch breaks...they need more people ringing...\" Keep in mind, this wasn't really taking that long. When finally getting her turn, the cashier was moving a pair of pants to the side and the customer starts speaking to her very sternly. \"My time is being wasted. How about you wait to do that later so you can get through me and all these people?\" The cashier kind of looks at her, and says nothing, upon which this lady felt the need to say \"Do not use that tone with me at all.\" And complains that the one bag she had needed to be split up between like three different gift cards and her credit card or something. Basically being difficult. \nShe leaves just as I am being taken by the other cashier. I don't hesitate to tell the other cashier (who now looked pretty distressed) that I would have rung that lady up even slower. She laughs, and I'm just happy I could make her feel better. \nWe don't intentionally ring you up slow, or intentionally only have a few number of people ringing. Patience is a virtue, and if you're on limited time sometimes it's best to shop another time.  ",

        "text": "Today I went to the Popular cell phone carrier store after speaking to online customer service. They scheduled me a maintenance appointment, however when I arrived I was informed that the techs do not work on the weekends at that store. A sales representative helped me try to troubleshoot my phone to attempt to get it to work again. However he was unable to and suggested I come back in on Monday. When I checked my email this evening I saw that I had an email that contained a Sales Receipt and Consumer Summary. On this new receipt it had an added $5 monthly charge to begin my nights earlier. The receipt and summary also contained my initials, however these were forged. I contacted customer service (all through chat, since my phone is not working) first asking if their had been any changes to my account. I was told no there had not been, I then inquired about this additional charge and when it had been added. He shared that it had been applied to this billing period. I asked how this happen and he shared that it was a \"mistakenly activated\" and I that he would take it off. I shared that I was concerned about how it had been activated and he said \"You don't need to worry at all\". I shared that I received a receipt, with my initials although I never initialed anything, and he once again just said \"You don't need to worry at all.\" \n\nHas this ever happen to anyone? is it normal to get a receipt after someone troubleshoots your phone? Could it really been added accidentally, I want to think the best about the situation. But, it seems as if the purposely foraged a change in my services. \n\nThey resolved the fee, but I don't feel comfortable with having my initials forged and a charge added.  What would you all do?

        "text": "So once upon a time I was in high school. My friends were assholes. Like, real assholes. The kind that think the world revolves around them. We went to a specialty burger place (great service, great food!) sadly they moved.... Ok. So the 4 of us went to the restaurant, unsupervised by our parents, and were led to a booth. One of the girls wanted to sit by the window so they moved us. Not a problem! We looked over the menus and 3 of us had our orders figured out pretty quickly. The 4th, we'll call her C, was still deciding how she wanted her burger cooked. The waiter took our orders and came back 5 minutes later hoping C was done. Nope. She hadn't picked sauces. There were maybe 5 sauces to choose from, she ended up getting ketchup on the side -_- \n\nShe still wasn't done. She wanted cheese. But what type?! There were 4 types of cheese to choose from. They were just basic cheeses, nothing French or whatever but she was dying choosing a damned cheese!  I swear to god it took her 10 minutes to pick a cheese and bun type. The poor waiter, he was back and forth and so patient. Poor thing. Once we got our food (so good...) the others keep sending stuff back. I didn't know it had onions on it, ew. Can I get more ketchup on here? What kind of lettuce is this? Ew, I like Romaine. I apologized to the poor guy every time one of them would do something stupid (hit on him, ask for his number, shoot a spitball at him across the room) They had him come to the table a few times just to flirt. He was at least 25, we were 14-16.\n\nWhen we went to leave, they agreed that a tip wasn't needed. C said that a 15% tip was typical, which would have been something like $10 and they wouldn't put down $10 or let me. So they left without giving him a tip, left the table a mess, made this guy their slave, and sexually harassed the guy. \n\nJosh, if you're reading this, **I'm so sorry.**\n\nEDIT: I no longer hang out with these girls, for very good reasons.",

        "text": "Might be a long one.\n\nSome months ago, my stepdad came to the area to visit, and unfortunately, he is part of a regional carrier that gets plenty of service where he lives but absolutely none in our area. Off to the Mart of Walls to find something that'll get him by for now. Sadly, the phone and carrier he wanted wasn't available, but we found the same phone on a different carrier that should get the job done, at least for now.\n\nAnd that was our biggest mistake. You see, this carrier is one of many prepaid arms of ShitCarrier (hereafter called SC), who might possibly be the most idiotic carrier known to man. I figured since my stepdad didn't ask a lot of his phone, that everything would be perfectly fine and we'd all be good. **NOPE.**\n\nThe first catch was that because we purchased this device from the Mart of Walls we had to go through an *entirely* different activation process. Which worked just fine at first, but then the phone would just sit there at \"Preparing your Device\". Forever. I even let it sit all night. Nope, still sitting there doing nothing, even though signing into the account online showed everything should be active.\n\n(Interpolation to explain some stuff: Every carrier in the US here has a pretty robust way of phone activation: You activate a SIM card, you slip that SIM card into your phone, bam, you're activated. SC and its prepaid arms, however, require you to dial a code, have the phone reach up to the SC's servers, and pull down the bits that say \"hey, I'm activated!\" There are LOTS of things that can go wrong with this system, and the whole thing is a holdover from before smartphones even ruled the world. It's old, creaky, and shows its age.)\n\nI've dealt with this issue before when I used to be a customer of SC proper. The phone will try to activate with the data network, but obviously the phone can't see it's activated, therefore no data connection with SC exists. Therefore, putting the phone on a Wi-Fi network and trying again should make it work. And it did!\n\n...for a bit, at least. It gave us a completely random phone number, one that was like 10 states away from where we actually are. But never fear, the SC Prepaid app on the phone tells us it can give us a number based on our billing address! Yes, please do that!\n\n...and the phone goes dead. Not unexpected, as the phone has to get a new number, and as such, a new identity. So we give it a few hours to take, then try reactivating the phone. No dice whatsoever. Try the wi-fi trick. Still not working, it simply gets hung up at \"preparing your device\", even through factory resets. Clearing out the activation information from the phone with a dialer code doesn't work. Something is very broken on SC Prepaid's end, so I pick up the phone and call them...and they swear our phone number doesn't exist. Even though it's the very phone number shown on the account when we log into SCP's website. WTF?\n\nI manage to get a rep, who tells me that they need to consult with the back office about this and that they would call me tomorrow. Doesn't even try to troubleshoot, just says they have to wait on some mysterious Word of God from the fabled back office which is oh-so-conveniently closed until tomorrow. Not 'avin it, but they won't budge. Fine, you can have a day.\n\nI call in the next day, and this time instead of simply not recognizing the phone number, it kicks me over to SC's postpaid support, who tells me I've called the wrong department and hangs up. Didn't even bother to redirect me to the right place. Fine, I do what I did yesterday, act like I don't have a phone number and am trying to activate service. Give the rep the information, and she tells me that I've got the wrong department and that I need to call an entirely different number and that they might be closed for the day. (in the early afternoon? What even?!) Get the number, give the new number a call. \n\nThis time, to their credit, they actually did something that might resemble troubleshooting. Had me power cycle, factory reset, etc, and nothing worked, but of course it wouldn't, because all of this was on *their* end. Their activation systems are provisioning the phone wrong, therefore not allowing it service. Of course, once we established that...\n\n\"We have to consult with the back office about this sir. They're closed for the day and we can get back to you in 48 hours.\"\n\nConsidering it's already been 3 days since this clustershag started, I wasn't about to let them shoo me away that quickly, and explained as such. She escalated me to a supervisor, who actually, to their credit, tried to fix things before telling me that the fabled back office is saying not to do activations right now because the activation system is down for maintenance for the night, and that's why I've been having trouble...\n\n...for the last three days...\n\nAnd so the supervisor told me to merely wait a few hours and try again, and that was that. Of course, it was *still* broken, and I couldn't call back in because it was after hours. Damn it, hoodwinked again.\n\nEntering day 4, I call in again, and they again run me through the same song and dance that we know doesn't do jack. And again, they try to make me wait on their fabled back office, to which I immediately escalate to a supervisor. No. Done with this shit. If the phone isn't working by the end of the day, I want my money back. And I make this damn clear to the supervisor. \n\nThen she has a genius idea: We'll just cancel your account, and start a whole new one and reprovision everything, and we'll give you an extra month's credit which will make us square, right? Right. Everything gets done, and the supervisor tells me they'll be more than happy to refund me completely if it doesn't work, but if I could wait just one more night for the reprovisioning to take place. Fine. I don't have high hopes, but at this point I've really got no other option.\n\nThe next morning, to my surprise, the phone had actually activated and was seeing the network just fine! It did again offer me to get a local phone number (I declined that shit so fast...), and it worked flawlessly from there.\n\nBut this experience served as a nice reminder of why I left SC in the first place a few years back. Their entire back end is archaic, falling to pieces, and they seem to be making zero effort to modernize it, resulting in issues like these happening (and being a pain to fix).",

        "text": "This happened to my mom more than me. I was only there for part of the interactions.\n\nThis was when I was in elementary. We lived in a small town at the time and our car was a used green LTD. My dad (sometimes he can be dense) was apparently in the car with my mom but she was driving for once. He was annoying her as he usually does (he does it to me too) where they had come to an intersection, the light turns green but my mom always hesitates to make sure nobody runs the light. My dad starts harping on her about \"go... go... go\" apparently. She finally starts the car to move fwd and this car hits the front end on the passenger side of the car hard!\n\nMy parents were obviously freaked out, my dad especially because if not for my mom taking her time, he would have been hurt if not killed. If you don't know what an LTD looks like, it's a large 80s luxury car (ours was a prettier green than this https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/'79-'80_Ford_LTD_Sedan_%28Hudson%29.JPG ). Very long in the front so had my mom taken off immediately, that length wouldn't have been the part that got impacted. It would have been the passenger side door where my dad was.\n\nThe driver ended up being an underage kid who not only wasn't old enough to drive but he had his permit revoked. My mom doesn't take his lies or excuses seriously. He kept trying to get her not to turn him in but it's hard to do that when you were T Boned and my dad almost got seriously injured.\n\nOf course my mom takes the kid's info but he's not insured but she puts in a report at the courthouse about this. I'm with her for this part and I vaguely recall this older women (60ish I guess) coming out to greet us. Soon as she realizes what my mom is reporting she gets very cold with her. The clerk actually gets testy with my mom and it ends up the boy that hit them is her grandson (it was a very small town). She acts like she's going to refuse to post the complaint my mom is putting in and accuses my mom of accosting the kid who's just trying to make up for past wrongs. My mom doesn't back down easily, making her voice loud enough as she repeats back what the lady said about NOT filing her complaint. Everyone kind of turns our way and the clerk quickly changes her tune although reluctant. They end up paying for the damages to the car I think. Let's just say it's a good thing those old cars were built like tanks.\n\nI can't believe the lady thought she could just hide the fact my mom was hit by her grandson and use that power in the courthouse to make it disappear! I don't know if my mom ended up complaining about the woman later or not. People like that should not work in jobs of importance like the courthouse. ",

So upset in fact I don't care that I have to be up in six hours I'm going to tell this story!\n\nIt all started a few hours ago when I decided that skipping the gym today was a bad idea.  I'm in a weight loss competition and I'll be damned if I lose to a particular coworker. So off to the sweatshop I went. I have a love hate relationship with the gym, I hate going and I love not being there.  Just kidding but tonight I really had it out. I ran on the elliptical for an hour and a half jamming to my beats and sweating like a flamboyantly gay man at a Westboro wedding. Anyway, after running I liftedfor about half an hour so I resembled a dying wildebeest. \n\nI remembered belatedly that I needed to pick up a couple items at the store. Because it was late and the store is right next to my gym I figured I could get in and out before my smell and visage repulsed too many people.  So I make my way quickly through the store grabbing my toothbrush and dental floss.  I then arrived at the checkout where one person was in front of me.  She was paying with a check and the cashier was having a hard time figuring out what to do.  After a couple minutes the manager on duty came over and finished out the transaction. No big deal. She then scanned my items and asked for my loyalty card. I swiped it and then pull out my card to pay. \n\nJust to give you a reference the cashier had to have been in her sixties. The years had not been kind and she was stooped over the counter.  I ran my credit card.  She then says \"It's declined\" in the snootiest voice I have ever heard.  I know that is not correct so I swiped it again and she grins like a Cheshire Cat and practically shouts \"It's declined\".  Bewildered I pull out a different card and swipe. She then is practically hopping with glee as she tells me it is declining. At this point I'm very confused. I asked her to try again as credit instead of debit.  She sighs and does it and then practically sings \"It's DECLINED you have NO MONEY!\"  I'm incredibly embarrassed and furious. \n\nThen a gentleman from the next checkout over looks at the cashier and says that none of the card readers are working. Unwilling to give up her triumph the cashier responds that they were working just fine a minute ago and only my card is declining. That's when he looks around and waves his arm at the ten people standing in lines unable to pay because the card reader isn't working.  The manager on duty is frantically calling people to figure out what to do and she refuses to believe it.  She is standing there clutching my bag to her chest like I am going to snatch it away and  run out with my $7 worth of merchandise. \n\nThe manager then starts checking people out at the courtesy desk hoping to use a different terminal. I politely ask for my bag and reach my hand out as she continues to clutch it like a purse from a 19th century hobo. As everyone stares at her she reluctantly hands over my items. We then discovered that no terminal would work and I had to leave my toothbrush behind as I needed to get home and shower before bed.  And yes I was wearing my ombré pants. \n\nTl;dr: Smeagol insults us hobbites and won't relinquish the precious. \n",

        "text": "For the record, I was a computer repair technician up until 2010 when I took out early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nIn my particular case, I have a fairly new laptop, less than a year old and I've been having issues with it that have gotten worse as time has gone on: in particular I had frequent bluescreens that addressed either the graphic card drivers or the wifi drivers, I experienced very slow write rates to the SSD, the ODD couldn't write anything and every so often, the laptop monitor would shut down and refuse to turn back on again, while the external monitor still worked fine.\n\nOf course, being former computer repair, I did the basic troubleshooting, reinstalled windows, upgraded and downgraded drivers, hell as a last resort, I even tried checking if the issue got resolved in Windows 10 (nope, made things way worse by far).\n\nAny way, to move on, since I hadn't used warranty repair on any of my products in who knows how long, I contacted the tech support line to make sure I was following the proper procedures.\n\nThis is not a direct transcript, just the most important details:\n\n&gt;Me: I have a Laptop with issues, I would like to verify how I report the issues to you and how to send it in for warranty repairs.\n\n&gt;TS: You fill in the form at (address), then in the box you send the laptop in, you write a note with all the issues and what you have done to resolve them if anything\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you\n\nSo I went ahead, did as I was told, a little annoyed since I haven't had a printer in years and ended up having to walk all over my town to find someone willing to print it out, but I got it done, I wrote down every single error I had encountered, all the steps I had done to troubleshoot and repair the errors, so on and so forth, then sent the laptop in.\n\nTwo weeks later, I got it back, the form I received with it was lackluster at best, but this is what it read.\n\nDay 1: Repair request received, awaiting arrival\n\nDay 4: Item has arrived, assigning technician\n\nDay4: Technician assigned, on bench for inspection\n\nDay4: Parts ordered, awaiting parts\n\nDay8: Parts arrived, closing case\n\nNow, I didn't want to be skeptical at first, I've written update notes myself in the past after all, but I booted up the laptop, they had installed the factory windows 8 image, and that was the only thing I saw, not a big deal, but I went on to test the ODD since it was the easiest thing to test, it didn't work, still broken.\n\nI contacted tech support again and let them know and to ask what to do further.\n\n&gt;Me: I have just received my laptop with (repair number) today and the ODD is still broken, I don't want to be skeptical, but this makes me worried none of the other issues have been fixed as well.\n\n&gt;TS: Let me look at the repair#\n\n&gt;Me: Take your time, I'll wait\n\n&gt;TS: There's no report of the ODD being broken in the repair notes\n\n&gt;Me: I notified you of it when I originally contacted you and it was written on the note you told me to write up to specifically say what's wrong with the computer.\n\n&gt;TS: Checking\n\n&gt;TS: According to the notes, there was no note with the unit.\n\n&gt;Me: The note was laying with the laptop as per your instructions and I have found the note in my return delivery, so I know that to be a lie.\n\n&gt;TS: I apologize for the inconvenience, but all we can do is for you to send it back in.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, do I make a new order or will it be on the original repair number?\n\n&gt;TS: New order, but reference the old repair number in your ticket, I will link this chat to our internal records as reference for the technician.\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you, have a nice day.\n\nI followed my new orders, made a new order, referenced the old number and sent the laptop back in, and while I was writing this up, I got the message the laptop is ready to be picked up, hopefully, working this time!",

        "text": "This was a few years ago when I went with a friend on a short road trip , I was driving with my friend in the passenger seat. We pulled into a popular fast food chain at around 2am. The driver side window on my truck is broken and doesn't roll down, but the passenger side window does, so I decided I'd reverse through the drive thru so my friend could roll down the passenger window and interact with the drive through employee rather than me having to pretty much get out of the vehicle to do so.\n\nSo I reversed all the way up to the window, and the kid(maybe around 17) who was running the drive through window was gonna give us our food when the manager came over the intercom telling us to leave and drive back in forward or they wouldn't serve us. So I turned around and drove back up to the window to get the food. Even though the manager didn't like my attempt to take the drive thru in reverse, the kid had quite a laugh about it, and I felt good to have brightened his likely boring night shift up a bit.\n\nNot an overly exciting story, but I figured someone might enjoy it.",

        "text": "Hello y'all!!!\n\nSeems like I'm on a lucky strike here with the beautiful workers. I promise I don't give people attitude and that I tried my hardest to be nice, easy going and to do as much as I can to help the clerk. Since I was in a retail position myself, I know how much of a pain in the ass it is to deal with customers, especially so when they don't have their shit together. Anyway, I digress. Onto the story!\n\nToday I went to my college bookstore to return my rental books (that btw, I never used) and this is how it went:\n\n&gt; Employee: I'll be right with ya!\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, thank you so much!\n\nHe took a little bit of time but he finally got to me.\n\n&gt; Employee: You're checking in books?\n\n&gt; Me: Yes sir I am! Here they are.\n\nI handed him my books along with my student ID, assuming he would need it to get my order and do the return/check-in.\n\n&gt; Employee: I need a phone number please.\n\n&gt; Me: Sure, but I don't know if I have the right one, I recently changed it. Will my student ID help?\n\n&gt; Employee: No. We need a phone number.\n\n&gt; Me: Ok, try (123) 456-7890\n\n&gt; Employee: Nope, nothing. Another one?\n\n&gt; Me: Hmm... (123) 456-9870?\n\n&gt; Employee: No. You need to remember the number you gave us.\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry but I don't. I recently changed it and those are the only ones that come to my mind. Is there another way? Maybe with my e-mail, my receipt or my student ID?\n\n&gt; Employee: No. Just by phone number.\n\n&gt; Me: Oh gosh... Well... Let me check my online receipt.\n\nSo I check my online receipt and nada. Nothing. It's not there.\n\n&gt; Employee: Do you have it?\n\n&gt; Me: No, sorry. God only knows which number I gave, I'm sorry.\n\n&gt; Employee: Well, I don't know your phone number, you know!? so it's not like I can pull it up here if you don't give it to me!!!\n\nAnd that's where I got mad. I didn't yell at him but I wasn't as soft or apologetic anymore.\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, obviously. There's no reason as to why you should know my phone number, that comment was unnecessary.\n\n&gt; Employee: *loud sigh* Ok, what's the name you gave for your order?\n\n&gt; Me: The one on my student ID.\n\nSince I have a long foreign name, I gave it to him so he could copy it directly without dealing with my accent while spelling.\n\n&gt; Employee: By the way, the number you gave is (123) 456-0987, so you remember it next time. Your books have been checked-in.\n\n&gt; Me: OK! Good thing that unlike what you said, there was most definitely another way to pull my order up!! It's very nice to know that my phone number was not absolutely necessary and that we just could've done it with my name or other information and that the system didn't forbid you from doing it. Glad to know it was not impossible without the phone number! Thank you truly for aaaall your help.\n\nAnd I left. I admit I was an asshole and that my sarcastic response wasn't necessary, but it truly bothered me the fact that he yelled at me saying that he didn't know my phone number. I understand it is frustrating and that I should've kept it with me, but like I had told him, I had recently changed it so it didn't immediately pop up in my mind. That + the fact that they usually treat us students like crap, didn't go over well with me.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So I went to NYC a couple of years back and I stayed for my 2nd time at this very old but nice hotel. I wouldn't say it was fancy but it was reasonable at the time price wise (under $150). So I get up to my room, go into the bathroom because I sort of need to go and notice immediately the toilet seat is coated with what appears to be a very thick splatter of \"pee.\" (eeeeeew)\n\nThere's nothing to clean it up with in the bathroom and I remembered passing a cleaning lady outside so I went to get her. Unfortunately, she seemed to not speak English but I think she was speaking Italian. I try to show / explain to her that the toilet is dirty on the seat. She promptly tells me in broken English \"no... clean!\" and lifts the lid and points at the bowl. I smile and shake my head trying to be nice and grab some toilet paper and put the lid back down, pointing at the seat very obviously and saying \"no... dirty.\" and she just shakes her head and lifts the seat again pointing at the bowl with the same reply.\n\nFinally she gets what I mean, grabs one of the hand towels I would have used and sprays what smells like bleach on the seat and gives it not even a good wipe down. It's still covered in pee crap but she points and says \"clean\" in a kind of \"you moron, it's clean\" kind of voice. It's not clean and I say so and she mutters something about me cleaning it up myself with a huffy attitude, leaving the used hand towel and bleach on the floor. I'm totally baffled by her attitude. I wasn't being rude and if toilet paper and water would have cleaned this properly I would have done that.\n\nI call the front office and they tell me to call that lady and I tell them what happened. Ends up I think she was someone's mother (the people who ran the place were Italian I think) and so they say \"oh... then can you wait 20 mins for the next person?\"\n\nI know, I probably could have cleaned it up myself. I have a kind of \"allergy\" to bleach cleaners. The smell makes me dizzy and light headed or I would have just cleaned it up myself. I just held everything and waited for someone to come.\n\nAnyone else have this experience in NYC?\n\nThe only other issue I had with this place is the first time I stayed there they mopped the very narrow 100 year old stairs w/o putting out \"wet floor\" signs. The elevator (also 100 yrs old and run by an actual person) was out so I started down the stairs and nearly killed myself. The stairs were painted black and it was hard to see they were wet much more they were still soapy! Talk about asking for a lawsuit!",

I said \"Sorry, how much were the tops again?\"\n\nShe then takes the tops out of the bag and HUFFS like I'm inconveniencing her.\n\n\"12.99 each...\"\n\nAt this point I'm a bit wound up because I've been nothing but polite and she hasn't apologised but her face tells me she knows she's done something wrong, so I respond \"Well that doesn't really add up to what I've been charged...\"\n\nShe huffs AGAIN but doesn't even say anything! Not one apology! She just runs up the items again in silence.\n\nAt this point I'm baffled I haven't got even a \"Sorry, my mistake\" so I say \"Is there any reason I just got charged more?\"\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye and said \"The barcodes are so similar that sometimes you pay for a different item\"\n\nNow I know this is bullshit, but as I didn't really want to argue that it was bullshit I just responded \"Oh, so if I hadn't of noticed then I would have been charged extra?\"\n\nHer response: \"Well you have a receipt, just return it...\"\n\nThinking of writing to their complaint department.

I hope this doesn’t violate the rules of this sub.\n\nThis happened to me while going through a Popular Chicken Sandwich Chain drive-thru. I was waiting in line when this car with three guys in it pulls up behind me blasting music. They had one of those sound systems where it just sounds like muddled shit with bass blasts rattling the car. However, as soon as they stopped, they cut the music off. \n\nAt this point, there was a woman in a van in front of me placing her order. What follows is a transcript of various things yelled out by these gentlemen. As you’ll see, I believe there was a 99.99% chance these guys were stoned out of their minds.\n\n“Get that rotisserie! Get that rotisserie javelin!”\n(very loud and rhythmic) “KEnny ROgers ROASTERRRRSSSSS!”\n\nThe woman looked back with a concerned look but then continued ordering.\n\n“Let’s get it while they fill it.” (or fil-et, as in a play on “filet”? I’m not sure.)\n“We gotta move this chicken, man.”\n\nThe woman finishes ordering and I start pulling up to the intercom. Before I even reach it, I hear “Hurry up, man!” After I’m asked for my order, I purposely tilt my head out the window in their direction and say, loudly enough that they’ll hear me, “Just a minute.” I then exaggeratedly stretch my arms, place my hands behind my head, and lean back. This is met with a “God damn!”\n\nI place my order and drive ahead. The last thing I heard them say as they approached the intercom was “Man, just gimme a million chickens, man.”",

Nothing expensive but pretty reasonable.\n\nI was cleaning and found the bag, still in the shipping bag in the back of my closet. I figured since I forgot about it, I'd return it. I'll preface this saying that when it came in the mail, it had several packets of silica gel that had exploded. I saw it no big deal and just turned the bag inside out and emptied it. Back into the bag and my closet it went.\n\nI go into the store and hand it to a woman who promptly inspects it - no big deal.\n\nThen she says, \"we do not usually accept used items but I will this one time. Just do not do it again.\" Highly irritated, I told her that I did not use it. In fact, the attachable shoulder strap was still factory sealed in plastic. \n\nAfter pointing that out, she says while turning the whole bag inside out \"SO, you are saying that it has always been this dirty??\"\n\n\"That is not dirty and in fact, the packets of silica gel tore at some point during delivery or prior to being mailed to me.\"\n\nHaving worked at this chain before, I know often times items that are mailed out are either from a distribution  center OR a actual store where items that may have been used are placed back onto the floor or are in general bad condition. This bag was in great condition and if it was in poor or used, I would've returned it and ordered another one the day it arrived.\n\nso she says \"hmm....if you say so\" as she smacks her lips and switches the weight of my body onto her right hip while making a face. \"i'm still gonna have to damage this used bag out\" she says as she takes out a label and checks \"damaged\" and begins to cut the bag up.\n\nI felt like telling her \"if you don't want to accept it, then don't accept it. you don't gotta be a ass with attitude about it.\"\n\nThe leather on the handles wasn't even cracked. The leather was still stiff (which usually starts to soften after a use). The straps were still wrapped in plastic too. I didn't even tie on the fringe (which were in plastic too) onto the bag either.\n\nSo how am I supposed to have used a bag, that had parts still wrapped in plastic AND tags attached with the brands own colored and thick fasteners??\n\nI understand being proactive about theft and return abuse but i don't like being accused of some straight up trifling bullshit.",

I go to the photo center, and the employee is an older woman with an attitude that ticked me off from the beginning. This is how it went:\n\n&gt; Employee: *smacks lips and puts her hand on her waist* Ummmm we first weigh the cartridge, and if it's half-full or kind of full, we won't refill it.\n\n&gt; Me: Sure, sounds good.\n\nSo she weighs my ink cartridge, compares it to her chart and then she asks me for my membership, scans it twice and it doesn't go through.\n\n&gt; Employee: Your membership has something wrong. Go to customer service to get it fixed and then you come back.\n\n&gt; Me: There's nothing wrong with my membership. I know for a fact we recently renewed it. It might not be going through because it's Mexican, not American.\n\n&gt; Employee: Well, it says on the machine that there's something wrong so you're going to have to go to customer service.\n\n&gt; Me: No, there's nothing wrong with it. It's because it's Mexican but I've never had trouble using it here, at all.\n\n&gt; Employee: *smacks her lips again* Mmmkay, let me call my manager.\n\nShe calls her manager and my husband approaches me, so I explain to him why it's taking so long and the employee interrupts:\n\n&gt; Employee: Oh, you said it so nice to him. You answered so serious to me when I told you, as if you were bothered or angry.\n\n...Seriously? She expects me to talk to her the way I talk to my husband? \n\n&gt; Me: Maybe I'm talking to him sweetly because he's my husband and you're a stranger.\n\nShe remained quiet, then the manager came and he told her\n\n&gt; Manager: Did you put the code /7 before scanning her card?\n\n&gt; Employe: No...\n\n&gt; Manager: Then do it.\n\nSo she did and magically there was nothing wrong with my membership and it worked. \n\nI understand she might not have known, but don't tell me so sure and sassy that there's something wrong with my stuff without making sure that you did things correctly first. I wouldn't have minded going to customer service if it was indeed my membership -_- but being that it's paid for and that there has never been a problem with it, it ticked me off along with her attitude.",

I was of course annoyed because I was just on a plane for 3 and a half hours and was exhausted from my travels. \n\n**This is the part that ticked me off the most:** When my boyfriend and I were waiting in the lobby, a housekeeper on duty comes down and starts bitching to the hotel manager that she has to clean more rooms and how she wants to go home for the night.

Being a Friday afternoon in a pretty dead mall, the store was pretty empty so I thought I'd be in and out in 10 minutes. As usual, I was wrong. \n\nThere were only 3 people working in the entire store. 2 were up front managing the floor, and one woman was cashiering. I go up to pay for my candle (and other splurge items that I did not need) and there were 2 people in front of me (one at the register being checked out and another person with only a couple small items). \n\nThe woman being cashed out decided that her purchase was too much money and AT THE COUNTER, she started to smell each of her 10-15 products to determine which scent she liked best. After about 5-10 minutes, one of the ladies on the floor finally came up and started to cash the woman in front of me, and ultimately me. The sniffer ended up not purchasing anything which peeved me worse.\n\nI will never understand people who will hold up a line for that reason and not offer to step aside to make their decision. ",

It's fantastic). I went online and placed an order for takeout for a vanilla milkshake and a poutine. For those of you unfamiliar with this brilliant staple of Canadian culture, it's literally just fries with some cheese curds and gravy thrown on top. Turns into a goopy, salty, artery-clogging mess of deliciousness.\n\nI'm quoted a pickup time of 5:10. Maps says it's a 10 minute drive, so I leave just before 5. Walk in at 5:10 on the dot. The girl at the hostess stand takes my name, I pay, she asks her coworker to go get it. Just then a massive family walked in and took up most of the front area so I sat down to avoid being knocked over by children.\n\n5 minutes go by, and I'm starting to wonder how long it takes to grab an order. A girl comes out of the back and approaches me, saying she has a \"quick question about my order.\" I was pretty confused about it because I'm not sure how complicated a poutine and a vanilla milkshake is, but it turns out it was someone else's order she wanted to check.\n\nAnother 5 minutes go by. My parking has expired, but I'm reassured they're just packing it up. Finally my order comes out. It has a nice little sticker on the bag that says it's been \"spot checked\" for accuracy.\n\nI get home, open it up, and I'm immediately confused. I see fries. I see cheese curds. Is it just a really light-coloured gravy? Nope, they've forgotten it altogether. It's not a poutine, it's just fries with lumps of cheese. [Look how sad it is.](http://imgur.com/fB8SETv)\n\nSo I called the store, and they're sending me a new one in a cab along with some coupons. Fingers crossed it gets here before I have to leave for my test...I'm really hangry right now.\n\nUpdate: it arrived! The cab driver drove around my street like three times before he found my house and then bitched at me cause there's no number on the side entrance where I live. Also, it doesn't really have enough gravy...",

While we have a really nice tent-trailer, we like to stay in a hotel after driving all day.\n\nWe drive as far as we are comfortable and then stop by five p.m. so we have time to go to dinner.\n\nOn our way back from our trip, we stopped at a location of our favorite chain and went in to inquire about availability and rates.\n\nThere were two front desk agents, a male and a female.  I went up to the male because he was closest to the door and asked if they had any rooms available.  He said they had one room left with two queen beds.  I then asked the rate.  He quoted me a rate that was a little higher than we usually like to pay, but we were tired so I turned to my husband to make sure it was okay with him that we pay a little extra.\n\nBefore I could get a word out, the female desk agent spoke to us in a very condescending tone.  She said \"It's two QUEEN beds! And it's only ONE room!! And we DON'T have a trailer turn around!!! The next closest hotel is 40 minutes away.\"\n\nIt was obvious she did not want to rent us a room.\n\nNote: Our tent-trailer is about 4' x 7' and small enough to fit in a single parking space when we unhitch it from our Honda Ridgeline.  We were not grubby from camping as we stayed at a very nice campground with complete facilities including showers.\n\nI sort of understand the comment about no trailer turn around, but I hope she watched as I made a very easy u-turn in her parking lot.  I have no idea why she felt it was necessary to mention the bed size or the fact that it was only ONE room.  Maybe she thought I had a trunk full of badgers, all needing their own rooms.",

We got an over data charge and an additional 1GB charged to our account not once or twice but three times. \n\nYesterday, I had a free minute and decided to look up online how much upgrading our plan would cost compared to getting the overage charges. I’m looking and thinking “this can’t be right.” The prices listed for my plan and the next one up (15GB) were identical. So I call the company to inquire about it and learn that the 10GB plan had been discontinued and the 15GB plan was yes, the same price. Awesomeness right? It gets better.\n\nThe lady I was talking to then proceeded to backdate the upgrade to take the overage charges off. I was ecstatic! I guess I made her day with how I was carrying on singing praises about the awesome customer service because she then bumped my plan up to the 20GB at no charge.\n\nSo to all you reading who work in call centers, thank you! \n",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I’m the asshole of this story, I’m not proud of it.\n\n\nYears ago I went into the local C-store to get some Dr. Pepper (cause I have a DP problem). So I grab a 12 pack. I’m the kind of guy who never carries cash and pays for everything with the debit card. This place was having issues though and could only run cards as credit. Cashier #1 wanted to see some ID to go with the card. Not unreasonable I guess, so I pull out the driver’s license and hand it to her. To my surprise she tells me it’s expired. Back then, my state had a system where you could mail in for a DL renewal and they would send you a little sticker you could put on the back corner of the card that indicated it was still good until X date. Unfortunately, my sticker which had been on for several years had finally given up the ghost and fell off unbeknownst to me. I’m not the kind of guy to put up a fight about these kind of things, especially since cashier #1 is doing what she’s supposed to. Do I wish she would have just looked at the card, seen it was clearly me and just let me buy $3.00 of DP? Sure. But whatever, I’ll go home and get my passport and come back. Which I proceed to do. \n\n\nI waltz back up to the counter with passport and 12 pack to cashier #2. While she’s checking me out, cashier #1 asks “Did he bring valid ID this time?” Somehow after hearing this line, I snapped. I respond with “Yeah lady, that’s what I do. I make fake IDs and buy $3 worth of Dr. Pepper with it for shits and giggles. I’m a fucking criminal mastermind.” Cashier #1 is less than pleased. She tells cashier #2 that she can refuse me service. Poor sweet cashier #2 is caught in this cross fire and says it’s OK, she doesn’t mind checking me out. Cashier #1 then clarifies that she is telling cashier #2 to deny me service. Cashier #2 sheepishly tells me she is denying me service.\n\nThe SO had come with me this second go around and had already made herself an Icee (that’s what God intended a slurpie to be for you poor souls not in the know). So what to do with it since it’s already been made? I start to walk it back to the machine and realize that’s pointless. Then suddenly, I take the top of, casually dump the contents in the middle of the floor and toss the cup over my shoulder and begin to storm out. We’re parked in the front of the store facing in. As we get in the car, SO says “Jonny, they’re going to take your license plate number”. Sure enough cashier #1 is staring daggers at us through the window. I reply, “No they’re not” and proceed to back out in reverse through the gas station lot and a good ways down the street before taking off.\n\nIf you're out there cashier #2, I'm sorry (and cashier #1 too I guess).",

        "text": "Happy tale from a few days ago. My lovely wife &amp; I had just been seated at a nicer local restaurant when a loud crash came from the bar area, a lot of heavy thumping and some glass.  I immediately went to see if I could be of assistance, make sure nobody was hurt, help with broken glass, etc.  It was a freak thing - a large mirror on the back bar had come down, and while it swept a number of bottles to the floor and hit a manager and a bartender in the head, nothing broke and nobody was hurt at all.  Excellent, moving along, back to my table.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nDinner was an excellent shrimp stir fry, sweet and salty and gingery and shrimpy. Delicious.  About halfway through, I found one of those little labels they stick directly on the produce... or rather *half* of one of those labels.  I really wasn't that bothered by it, as there are worse things one can find in one's food - eggshell, plastic, hair, a ladybug, a seashell noodle burnt to blackened crumbling charcoal (all of which I've experienced).  But some people *freak the hell out* over such things, so when the server came by, I showed her the label.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI tried to be very clear that I personally wasn't upset in the least - these things happen - but suggested the kitchen might want to poke through the container of peppers to see if the other half of \"my\" label was still in there. She apologized repeatedly and said she'd tell them.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nA few minutes later the manager came over and apologized some more, and said she'd take my meal off the bill. I said it really wasn't necessary.  Then she realized I was the guy who had gone into the bar to see if they needed help after the big crash. That was the end of that - between being nice about the label and \"coming to our rescue in the bar\", she would not hear any more argument, she was taking my meal off the bill and that's final.  Well... OK then. If you insist. Free stir fry!  8-)  \nTLDR: I tried to be a nice guy, and the manager insisted on giving me free food.",

The bottom of the bag broke, and all the gifts spilled to the floor. A sales lady saw me, came over with another bag, and helped me pick up all my stuff (there was a lot!)\n\nI wasn't a customer of the store, and the sales lady doesn't get any commission out of helping me. It was just a RAOK, but it really touched me. I wanted to thank her, but other than saying \"thank you so much!\" repeatedly, i wasn't sure what else i could do. Giving her a tip would have felt really weird. \n\njust wondering how often you guys will visit a place of business, and have an interaction with an employee there (as a customer or visitor) that was particularly good or particularly bad, and made you want to comment on it? Other than thanking someone or providing them a tip, is there any middle-ground alternatives for pointing out a particularly good or poor customer service experience? \n\nI realize that leaving an online review is probably the default outlet for a lot of people, but I feel like that often tends to be a review about an overall experience at an establishment rather than calling out a particular employee (whether in a good way or a bad way due to your interaction with them). Like, if I left an online review about \"xxxx\" being so helpful to me, I don't feel confident that management would even notice that review about her.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "text": "When I was a kid we lived in a very small hick type town here in TX in the southern part. We had one small mall with a few shops and there was a small pharmacy inside that this really nice man ran. Every time someone passed by his shop inside the mall, he would be out there greeting people and say something to get them chatting before he mentioned one thing: \"Have you seen my pride and joy?\" He was probably in his 50 or so, an older man with still blackish hair, Hispanic and very nice. Usually if someone says \"pride and joy\" they mean grandkids or some kind of photo of their family / kids. My mom and I are like \"sure\" but I'm little so I really am just going along with my mom's response. He pulls out his wallet from his Pharmacist's coat (I believe it was powder blue) and pulls out a photo (we think) but it's not of family, wife or kids... it's a picture of soap. Dish soap and detergent I think. I found it hilarious and my mom kind of blushed and laughed because it was funny, plus the soap in the picture was called Pride and Joy. :P\n\nThe sad thing was, I really like this man. He reminded me of my grandfather a bit so if we passed by and he was out there greeting people, I'd go up to him and say \"can I see your pride and joy?\" and would get this funny look on his face and blush slightly and nod, taking the picture out for me to see. I still find it funny to this day now that I understand the joke better. Not sure today's generation would get the humor of this anymore but it was still funny when I was a kid in the 80s.\n\nFound a link to the picture he had in his pocket that I found online:\n\nhttp://www.naznet.com/community/attachment.php?s=e33381961c0d988a62c4cad8fabba634&amp;attachmentid=2337&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1304930043\n\n",

        "text": "I used to go to this one sandwich place all the time when I could actually go off campus and get food. I'm waiting in line and there's a girl ahead of me who's all huffy and commenting under her breath about \"why are you so slow and such and such\" about the clerk behind the counter. Poor girl working there was alone, looked upset about something and a little pale. I'd seen her a few times working there and she was normally a much happier person but today she looked stressed and not so happy but she was doing her job. The girl in front of me is still being a dork and not being nice at all to this poor employee trying to do the job of 3 people so when it's my turn I tell her to take her time. She's normally quite able to get orders done quickly but it's obvious something's going on and I have an hour for lunch so I'm not in any particular rush. She gets my order and I chat her up a bit and she says she was having to work not only on her day off but on a sick day. She wasn't feeling well but someone else called in and now she was here. She wasn't complaining but just sort of apologizing for her slowness today. I told her it was ok and I hoped she felt better. I got my sandwich and left her with a smile hoping that would help. I've been in her place before and the girl ahead of me was being such a B, I really wanted to say something but she looked ready to punch someone out just because.\n\nThe next day I went to the same place and the girl was there again behind the counter. She looked like she was much happier and feeling better. She waved at me when I came up and smiled and was all cheery compared to the day before. When it was my turn, she thanked me for being so nice to her and said she knew I liked cookies so it was her gift to me that mine were free today. I hadn't done it for anything free but was glad to know I had been able to help her feel better. I really don't like complaining much even when people are being idiots but she was trying to work that day and do her very best with everyone despite the situation. That girl in front of me hadn't help much though. I was trying to make the atmosphere more tolerable for everyone and at least the clerk felt less like it was all the customers against her. Been there and done that and it's not fun.",

        "text": "A few months ago my GF and I went into a branch of a fairly big electrics shop to look at new laptops.  We spent a while looking and finally decided we'd actually buy one then and there as it seemed a really good deal.\n\nSo we flag an employee down, he stares at the model we're pointing at with a slightly befuddled look on his face, checks the boxes nearby, then wanders off to a computer before returning and telling us they don't have any in stock.\n\nFair enough.  It would have been nice if it said that near the display model, but it gives us the chance to check online at home to see if it's available cheaper elsewhere, read reviews etc.\n\nAnyway, once we did all that it turns out it is a really good deal and that's the best we'll do, so we go to the retailers website to see if it's possible to find it in another shop not too far away.  Sadly there are no others nearby, but it seems like we should be able to order it to arrive at that shop in a day or two.  However when we go to checkout that option isn't available as it tells us it *is* in stock at the store, so we should just head down and pick it up.\n\nWe'd like to get this sorted in a few days as we're in the area visiting family, so we take our online number and head back to the shop thinking we just need to get them to acknowledge they don't have any and then they'd be able to order one for us.  This time the first person we flag down is a manager, and after hearing our story he quickly taps away at a computer and tells us it is in stock.\n\nOK, bit of a run around, but it all worked out fine.  Except the manager now wants us to squeal on who dealt with us the first time.  We're both a bit uncomfortable with this as it wasn't a massive deal and everyone makes mistakes, plus the manager has that false over politeness which leads one to suspect he isn't actually very polite at all.  But we sort of give a general description.\n\nThen the bloke points to a bunch of staff by the counter and says that that's everyone who's working today, so which one is it?  Which is made even worse by the fact that the kid from earlier genuinely isn't there - or, at least, if he is both me and my GF just don't recognise him.\n\nSo now the manager is halting processing the transaction whilst we're trying to stay general and vague with \"Sorry, maybe we don't remember, but we can't tell who it was, doesn't seem like he's there\" etc.  etc.  But he presses it to the point of giving us a lecture about how we're not helping him or the company, and that bad customer service affects us all, and that we'll be responsible for it happening to someone else.  The false politeness has now gone.\n\nEven if we wanted to we can't grass on someone we don't know, so can't help him.  There's a sour air around everything now, but the whole thing takes about a further ten minutes as we end up buying an anti-virus subscription on a deal that involves getting and registering three different yearly subscriptions, which is further complicated by the fact that we don't have an address in the country we're buying it in.\n\nWas fairly amusing afterwards, but the real question is who was the slightly clueless guy we saw at first?  He had a uniform and everything, and it really didn't seem like the sort of place to work at for a laugh.",

        "text": "Tonight I went out to eat with my mom and step-dad at a pizza place. For a Saturday evening the place wasn't super busy or crowded at all. So we order our drinks and food that consisted of a large supreme pizza. When our server brings out our pizza, she tells us that they're out of large pans so they made us two mediums. After finding out that we were still going to be charged for just a large pizza we happily began eating. Two mediums for the price of a large? Hell yeah! Really not that big of a deal to us at least. \n\nSo we eat and as my mom goes to pay, she overhears another server on the phone. The server tells the customer that they're not only out of large pans, but now they're out of medium pans too. *What?* The customer doesn't place an order and hangs up. That's when the server gets huffy and loudly proclaims \"at least that's an order I don't have to take tonight.\" Cue awkward eye contact between my mom and the server before she (the server) scurried off to the back. \n\nSeriously, how does a well established pizza place run out of pans? Especially when it's not busy in the dine in area. I understand they could have had a large call in order earlier that was tying up some pans, but an order large enough to do that is usually placed ahead of time. Is this some odd thing that happens every once in a while or is someone just not washing them like they should be?",

No clean clothes, only the most essential toiletries, and a single pair of sandals. I don't have enough money to buy any clothing and I am possibly starting a job this week. I am not at all prepared now and would really just like to know what's going on and to be reimbursed for whatever was lost and for my baggage fee. Thank you.*\n\nI've tried to get in contact with a real person on the phone, however, the wait time as always is ridiculous and you can't even file a reimbursement claim until it has been 21 days.

I didn't carry any cards, and I didn't want to. \n\nOne day, I head over to the bank to get some cash. This bank had just merged with another bank, and there was some sort of district manager present to oversee the transition. \n\nLike I did every month, I wrote out a check to myself and presented it with my drivers license to prove it was me. \n\nTeller: \"Go ahead and swipe your debit card so I can pull up your account.\"\n\nMe: \"I don't have one. It's easiest to look me up by my name and address.\" And I handed over my driver's license. \n\nTeller: \"Why don't you have a debit card?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know. I've just never been interested in getting one.\"\n\nTeller: \"But they're so convenient!\"\n\nMe: \"OK, but cash works just fine for me.\"\n\nIt was a slow morning, so the other tellers overheard the conversation and decided to crowd around. The district manager notices and comes around to see what's happening. \n\nDM: \"You don't have a debit card? Let's sign you up for one today!\"\n\nMe: \"No thanks. I really only want to cash my check.\"\n\nTeller: \"Signing up for a debit card is so easy! And it's super convenient!\"\n\nMe: \"No thank you.\"\n\nBut alas, the seed had already been planted. In all the teller's minds and the DM's, I just had to have a debit card. It went back and forth for a couple minutes. A new teller would tell me why I should have a debit card, and I would politely refuse. \n\nI started to get frustrated, and then pretty angry. However, I couldn't leave. The first teller still had my driver's license. I wasn't very assertive back then, so I didn't demand my license back. \n\nIn the end, I promised to sign up for a debit card the next time I was there, which placated the employees enough to give me my money and my ID. \n\nI never did sign up for a debit card with them, and I stayed with that bank (stupidly) until they tried to upgrade my account to one I would have to pay fees on without telling me. \n\nTL;DR - Bankers boldly bully boy, believing boy benefits by buying banker's buffoonery.",

        "text": "Just a little'un for you all today, but a cute one. :) \n\n(I do apologise if this doesn't belong here, but technically it happened in a shop, so...? Please let me know if it belongs in another sub! I really don't know that many yet!)\n\nThis happened a couple of hours ago. I've recently got a tattoo on the back of my shoulder (three little doves flying away, for anybody who's interested) and this afternoon I was shopping for tops that would show it off. There wasn't much I liked so I headed to the book section, where I'm much more comfortable anyway, and picked up a couple of the new YA releases. Then I headed for the incredibly busy checkouts.\n\nJust a quick side note: like a lot of people, I've been going through some pretty serious mental issues of late, not least of which is some medium-level social anxiety and depression. It's been bringing me down quite a bit recently, which of course doesn't do wonders for your outlook on life-- or, subsequently, on yourself. Today, for example, I'd just thrown on an old cotton dress and plain black flats, and my plain brown hair was down. My face was clear of any make-up. (Not that I'd know how to apply it properly anyway...) Basically, to cut it short and relevant, I wasn't exactly looking like a super model today, and I wasn't feeling like one either.\n\nSo there I am standing in line with my books, waiting to be served, when I get the feeling I'm being stared at. I glance up to see a little girl who was maybe seven or eight standing in front of me with her grandma, her arms tightly wrapped around a box of Star Wars Lego. \n\n\"Hello,\" I say, smiling. She looks at me with enormous blue eyes. \n\n\"Hello, pretty lady,\" she says back. I blink at her, surprised, and her grandma sort of half-smiles at me and tugs her away to the next available till without a word. \n\nBy the time I can be served, they're gone. I all but skip back to my car, my dress suddenly feeling like a princess dress, my hair bouncing and full of life.\n\nI can tell you now, you never feel as pretty as when a little kid tells you that you are. Especially when you're dressed like you're in bed with the flu.",

        "text": "This is a tale of appalling behaviour from a company that was trying to induce me to do business with them, using guilt and fear as their main marketing tactic. \n\nI was not a customer at the time of this experience although I have been in the past. I don't want to be a customer ever again.\n\nIn the UK a TV license is required to install television equipment or watch ANY program while it is being broadcast live. The license fee is used to fund the national TV service. Failure to have a license when required can result in prosecution*, £1000 fine and criminal conviction.\n\nLicensing authority like to send out \"goons\" to shakedown* non-payers who are presumed to have and use a TV.\n\nAt the time I didn't watch broadcast TV and didn't have a license, and so the company contracted to scare up freeloaders* into buying a license sent someone to pay me a visit.\n\nThis is the story of what happened (as near as I can recall).\n\n&gt; Goon: I'm from ______, are you the householder?\n\n&gt; Me: Yes\n\n(I've since learned that the correct answer to that question is something along the lines of \"What do you mean?\" or even to not answer; do I *really* know what it means to be a householder? Legally?)\n\n&gt; Goon: What's your name?\n\n&gt; Me: I don't want to answer that question\n\n&gt; Goon: Do you have any television receiving equipment here?\n\n&gt; Me: Am I required to answer that question?\n\nHe didn't say I was required to. If he had I would have continued with \"Who requires me?\" \"And what authority do they have to require me?\" - cos let's be clear, I have no business relationship with them.\n\n...but he didn't answer any of my questions in return.\n\nAfter a few rounds of this, he wasn't getting anywhere with his questions because I wasn't providing him with any information he might use to entrap* me and so he finished with his last shot:\n\n&gt; Goon: I'll pass your details on for prosecution as you are not co-operating.\n\nThere are no grounds for doing that, he hasn't even claimed that I am required to co-operate. He is trying to scare me into buying a license. No persuasion. No talk of value for money, or fine entertainment. Just legal threats. \n\nImagine your local cable company sending round goons instead of sales people. \"We think that you could be watching our programmes anyway... pay up!\"\n\n&gt; Me: That sounds like a threat\n\nWill he back down? No..\n\n&gt; Goon: I don't care what it sounds like\n\n&gt; Me: I'm going to report you to the police\n\nand he then walks quickly to has car which was wisely parked around the corner. Yay! I have technically just been assaulted by a Goon, so I phone the police.\n\nThe police agree that his behaviour doesn't sound to be as it should have been, and that therefore it was probably an imposter (it turned out that he wasn't an impostor, but as the police agree that his behaviour was that of an imposter it strengthens my case). I get my crime case number.\n\nI then write to the licensing authority, cc-ing my Member of Parliament (so that he may know how to respond next time TV licensing is discussed in Parliament), and quoting the crime number, to make my complaint to the licensing authority. (That's the first payback, as there is large public opinion against the borderline and sometimes worse tactics of the licensing authority in harassing people who are not customers. The licensing authority are sensitive to the bad publicity. Now someones MP is observer to what has happened and all correspondence. Nasty nasty scrutiny.).\n\nThe next revenge now comes in as managers are now required to interview the goon to discuss what went on. Such inconvenience for the goon and his managers, knowing that the MP is watching. Bad marks to the goon for being so careless as to cause such scrutiny.\n\nTheir response was that nothing happened that was not in accordance with their training.\n\nA great setup for me; I respond that I didn't doubt this finding, my concern was that this was exactly how callers were trained to act. (My MP still in on my correspondence including a copy of their responses. I expect that he is not reading it, but he can fetch it out later when TV licensing next comes up in parliament).\n\nMy revenge fully had, the correspondence ended uneventfully, with me stating that their callers may not visit me without an appointment being agreed in writing in advance (which would never suit their purpose of catching me in the act of watching broadcast TV). \n\nI received notice that I was put on the do-not-call list for two years.\n\nSince then I have had suspicious telephone or door-knock surveys on what TV programmes I watch. I have declined to participate. Such surveys can be normal, and I have had them, but I found two to be suspicious; particularly the door survey because the caller didn't move on to other householders in the area and too easily turned away when I said I wasn't interested. No human-to-human element, just a bad intention frustrated.\n\n----\n\n*Entrapment\n\nI was right to not answer the questions. The goon was trying to esbtablish jurisdiction over me. A named person, and a cause that would require me to have a license.\n\nIf I had denied having any TV receiving equipment I may be guilty of making a false statement as although I did not possess the classic TV set, I had multiple internet connected devices that could all receive broadcast TV over the internet, and a capture card used for playing video games on my TV monitor.\n\nThis false statement could be grounds for a warrant if I later admitted to having internet connected computers, mobile phones, etc, (which surely would have been the next question).\n\nIf I had admitted having TV equipment then this may be grounds for action, as I was not licensed.\n\nClearly a \"yes\" or a \"no\" answer could construed as false, and any other answer would get complicated, I naturally preferred not to answer!\n\n----\n\n* Freeloading \n\nThe loophole: A lot is made of people who watch programmes from the national TV service after they have been broadcast using their web based catch-up service which for some reason isn't linked to the TV license database; suspected to be due to the fear that younger users would abandon the national service altogther for other entirely web-based international TV services.\n\nSurprisingly little is made of the other loophole which requires those who only watch other TV services to still fund the national service.\n\n----\n\n*Shakedown\n\nThey start with scary letters and threats of prosecution. The letter is designed to cause the recipient to buy a license. It is difficult to see how to enter into any correspondence other than to make an online or telephone payment, or make what are really unnecessary declarations about your personal life.\n\n----\n\n*Prosecution. \n\nA friend of a friend lost a case because he let the licensing goon into his house, and the goon claimed that his large computer monitor showing a DVD was television. Talking to the goons cannot help you, only them.",

I found some that were on sale from 3.49 down to 1.99, awesome deal! \n\nSo, I head over to self-checkout and ring in my items. Unfortunately, the cookies rang up at full price. I turn to the lady manning the self-checkouts and all I managed to get out was a \"Excu...\" before she told me to wait and walked away. I didn't wait a horribly long time, maybe a minute or two, and she came back and asked what I needed. I asked if she could adjust the price of the cookies and her face looked as if I asked her if she could wipe my butt for me. She threw a fit and complained to me how she had so much to do and basically couldn't be bothered to go do a price check for these cookies. I asked if voiding it would be easier (hoping that she would want to provide some sort of customer service and say price checking is no problem) and as soon as I said void she took the cookies from me and voided them. Didn't say anything else to me. \n\nTLDR; I just wanted some cookies. ;__;",

        "text": "Hello fellow patrons.  Today's tale takes place in the mega mart once again.  I am currently gathering supplies for a fun art activity for my students. Because I have no budget I decided to do a project I've done in the past with my own kids. We are making plastic bag sun catchers. All that is required are various colored plastic bags and an iron.  Because different stores carry different bags I stopped by megamart to attempt to obtain a few.  \n\nI went immediately after work and I was still wearing my identification. I picked up a few items and checked out at the self checkout. Because I didn't want to just grab a whole bunch of bags I decided to politely request some. Obviously, I need to stop being nice as it seems to lead to disaster. \n\nCarrying my purchases I made my way to customer service where a young man identified himself as the manager on duty. I explained to him that I was in need of a few (up to 10) extra bags for a project for my students. He looked at my ID and commented that he had attended my middle school. Cool. So can I have a few extra bags for the project?  \n\nAbsolutely not!  He informs me that I'm not allowed to take any extra because I would be able to take the bags and fill them with things and steal. I'm flabbergasted by this insinuation. He then informs me that I can buy plastic bags at the sister store and can get about 100 for $15 so I should just spend the money if I really want them. \n\nHe then looks at me and tells me people have stolen before and \"As you teachers say one person ruined it for everyone!\"  I'm still reeling from the this insult when he reaches for my bags and says that he needs to search them to make sure I didn't have any extra bags and to hand over my receipt.  He then takes two of my bags and empties one and puts my ice cream in with my bread and takes the empty bag and puts it back on the register and looks at my receipt and hands back one bag. I then said I wanted my bag back because I didn't want my ice cream to squash my bread. He responded with \"You can't even have one extra\". \n\nNeedless to say I'm livid. What really just burns me is that on any given day at this store I always wind up with at least five to ten extra bags or if you buy three packs of gum you usually wind up with each in a different bag.  But because I requested extra bags I must be a thief. And had he simply told me I couldn't have any I would have understood but to treat me like a thief because I requested a couple free bags just ticks me off. \n\nTL;dr.  You can't have free bags for free. ",

Sorry if this doesn't go here, but I thought this was the most appropriate Tales subreddit for this.\n\nDuring college I lived in a dorm and spent the summers crashing at my parents place.  My parents, my brother, and I all shared cars as needed.  One day a police officer knocked on the front door and asked for me.  He asked if I had purchased gas at a local gas station earlier today, which I hadn't.  He then told me someone with my car had filled up on gas and drove away without paying (this was back when you could pay inside after pumping).  I then noticed my car wasn't in the driveway, which isn't too usual.  I called up my parents and we figured out what happened:\n\nThey were taking all the cars in today to fill up the tanks as gas prices had dipped a little.  They had both used the same card when filling my brother's and my car, so the pump declined the purchase on the pump for my car.  My mom, who was filling up my car, didn't notice the error message that said \"Please pay inside\" and drove off without paying.  Luckily the police officer believed me when I relayed the story to him and my mom was able to go back to the station to take care of the bill.\n\nLesson: please read signage/machines/packaging, because someone else might get blamed for your mistake.",
