        "text": "A few months ago, I heard about products designed to extract potable water from the air, by running one form of dehumidifier or another and then filtering the resulting water. I figured it might be convenient to put these devices at elevation, to reduce the need for pumping the resulting water by providing water pressure and allowing for gravity-based water filters.\n\nMore recently, I considered that water pressure would also allow for energy generation. Since water flowing from a greater height offers greater power generation, while elevation would not greatly increase the power use of a dehumidifier until the thinning of the air becomes an issue, I suspect that there is height that a dehumidifier could be held over a water powered turbine such that the flowing water from the dehumidifier is more than enough to power the dehumidifier itself, thus resulting in a hydroelectric plant that uses a stream of humid air as the reservoir.\n\nDoes such a system seem feasible, and if so, what considerations would need to be taken in deploying it?",

After seeing the concerns of others on my posts about it, I just want to make sure I'm not doing something incredibly stupid.\n\nWhen I do the testing after the cement is done curing, I'm going to have it set up with a shield between me and it, laying on its side with both ends facing in safe directions in case they decide to burst. I'm also going to put in a pressure release valve before doing any of that.\n\nThe piping is rated for 410 psi max operating and around 710 psi for burst, but I know liquid and compressible gases work differently when it comes to that. What are my risks? What would theoretically be the max psi I should use (whatever it is, I'll do half that, if even)?

        "text": "I want to put a 55 gallon freshwater tank in my upstairs bedroom.  I have it (I believe) to be on a load bearing wall perpendicular to my joists.  I determined this by looking at the way the floor joists were positioned under the bedroom above the garage.  I'm assuming the floor joists will run same direction then for rest of rooms upstairs.  The floor joists in the room above the garage are 2 x 10s so hopefully they are the same throughout.  \n\nThere is also an arch that separates my kitchen and living room.  My tank will be above that arch.  Not sure if arch is just decorative or support bearing.  Felt kinda hallow at bottom and soild at top when I tapped it.\n\nMy stand is made out of pine and has a flat base.  It does sit on carpet which makes me nervous but it is completely level on all sides.  \n\nMy house was built in 2017 by Soundbuilt up in the greater Seattle area.  I requested a structural plan from them and they refused to give me one.  I have a records request into the city for the plans but I'm not counting on anything.  \n\nI have two structural engineers at my company I work for.  I asked both of them this question and ofcourse I got two very different answers.  One said no way would he ever put a fish tank upstairs and the other one said that my floor should easily be able to support a 55 gallon.  \n\nSo here I am asking reddit.  The total weight according to my calculations is 675 lbs but lets just round up to 800 to be safe.  It should go over 3 joists over 6 sq feet.\nRoom is 18' x 18'.  We probably about another 400 lbs of items scattered about the room.  Bed, night stands, desk, etc...\n\nSo will this be safe in your opinion?

It only appears inside the apartment when we open the window.  \n\nIt was really bad in November but then it disappeared. We thought it was a dead mouse in the wall, especially after it went away after a few weeks, but now the weather is warmer and it is back with a vegeance. I think it only went away because it was really cold weather. \n\nWe live close to a train station (50m) and I was walking through the underpass yesterday beside the drains and it was the exact same smell there as in our apartment. So I am thinking it is coming from the same source\n\nOur apartment is in a bit of wind tunnel / pressure tunnel (not sure if this is the correct term). E.g. When we have the extractor fan on in the open plan kitchen/living room the windows and doors are kinda sucked shut and we have to really pull to get them open and then they 'pop' open.  \n\nI am not sure if the wind/pressure tunnel has something to do with the smell in the flat. Like the sewage smell from 50m away is travelling through the wind tunnel and into our flat and this could be why we can't smell it when outside. Could it be the case? If so, is there something we can do about it?   \n\nApologies for my lack of knowledge with the correct terms. \n\nThanks for any help, really appreciate anything.",

In this case, a coil of copper wire wound around a stainless steel rod, and surrounded by magnets, right?\n\nMy first question is where does the copper wire carrying the current then go? Supposing I wanted to generate power and store it inside a rechargeable LiFePO4 battery, do I just plug in the copper wire to the battery (I'm assuming not)? Would it go copper wire -&gt; inverter -&gt; regulator/rectifier -&gt; battery? Also what happens with the other end of the copper wire?\n\nBasically the mechanical and handiwork aspect make sense to me but the electronics is not as familiar to me.\n\nThank you!",

I was able to achieve this with a SMC pneumatic timer and a Versa VST-3401 solenoid, but the only issue is with the back pressure from the burst of air, it seems to put the solenoid in a midway state where the valve starts to chatter/oscillate and can only be stopped if air is diconnected. It doesn't seem very reliable so I'm wondering if anyone has needed to do this and has a solution or knows of solenoids/valves that may handle this better.",

        "text": "I recently left a Glassdoor review for a company I interviewed with, but didn't end up getting the job. I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.\n\nThe hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.\n\nI admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?\n\nI'm open to any honest feedback and opinions. Thanks for reading.",
