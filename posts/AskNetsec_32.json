        "text": "Hi. First of all, this is not at all my forte. I'm employed at a small agency that does websites and 'apps' (nothing sophisticated really, mostly just wrapped up HTML/JavaScript) and haven't ventured very far into pentesting etc. We've started a little side-track recently of tightening our sites' security and getting more knowledgeable about infosec, so we've been toying around a bit. There's heaps of tools around, and using them is not the issue, I think, it's more like we're lacking the 'big picture' that organizes the entire process of recon, information gathering etc.\n\nWe're trying to put on the hacker's hat and pentest our own sites. So far this is what we've done. (For clarification, the site in question resolves to an IP on which a couple other sites are hosted.)\n\n* NMAP scan the machine on which the websites are hosted\n* dirb scan a website, which yields some existing URLs\n* collect some email addresses that are visible on the public website\n* see that the site uses TYPO3\n\nNow, what would a hacker or professional pentester do next? Cross-reference open services revealed by NMAP with a vulnerability database? Try to detect which version TYPO3 is used and see if there are any vulnerabilities? Or rather attempt a phishing or social engineering campaign on the e-mail addresses gathered? It seems like any of these routes could lead to something, but it's hard to gauge which one is most promising.",

What is to prevent someone from brute-forcing my password to get access to everything?  Or hacking into the underlying app itself to get access to everything?  How can I trust my security to one company, when so many companies consistently fail to protect user data?\n\nI really want to make the leap as otherwise password managers seem sensible.

Then how duckduckgo became equalent to a secure, non tracking and privacy oriented search engine.\nSee TOR, it is funded mostly by US navy and other US goverment agencies. I also read somewhere that some TOR developers has knowingly added codes so that these agencies can monitor the users. Why cant duckduckgo be a similar kind of system?",

Is this something you all find useful?\n\nMy goal is to let you respond to security alerts completely without leaving the web interface. You can script common incident response tasks, like \"shut down machine\" or \"disable account\", combine them into workflows like \"contain ransomware\", and run them on your security alerts.\n\nOrchestrator has no learning curve. You write tasks in Powershell and Bash to run on endpoints, in any language to run from the Orchestrator server, and workflows in YAML. It can integrate with any product with a REST API.\n\nI know other security orchestration tools, like Phantom and Demisto, exist. But they force you to build workflows using their visual editors, which slows down experienced security staff. Writing tasks and workflows is a pain, too: see this [this Demisto playbook](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/TestPlaybooks/playbook-Autofocus_test.yml) or [this Phantom task](https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks/blob/3.5/customer_firewall_request_handle_artifact.py).=.\n\ntl;dr - check out this website.

I need to learn and go from zero to hero and have gotten a few books on modsecurity. \n\nRight now I'm good at dealing with false positives by adding what I need to the CRS ruleset. But I need to be able to create my own rules more complex and no idea where to start. \n\nSeems the info about there on creating rules is limited and the modsecurity annual is sometimes ambiguous. \n\nAny ideas?",

I'm curious about penetration testing and I've been thinking about ways to center my thesis around it.\nSo far my idea is trying to build an automated penetration testing tool (with no commercial purpose) as kind of an excuse to get hands on with it and detail the process.\nI wonder though if this is a realistic project for me. Some of the issues that come to mind are the fact that I don't have much practical pentesting experience (although I'd have around 6 months to do the whole project), how I'd perform the testing (would I have to build my own vulnerable environment?) or if I would be able to build a tool that is at least decent starting from scratch.\n\nAny opinions/advice on this? Is it worth looking more into it or should I try to go with something else?",

I used to write code in college and even landed a few offers, one of which I did not go through with (coz i didn't like the company) and a couple others were rescinded at the last moment for some reason. So I couldn't find a job for a few months (fresh out of college) and I decided to take this job where I was thrown into SOC. I know it's a growing field with a lot of potential but I have largely just been involved in making excel sheets and preparing reports rather than working with the actual SIEM. I've only so far developed a conceptual overview of what SIEM is (like decoders, concentrators, etc) and I don't even know how to identify XSS or what steps to take to mitigate vulnerabilities coz i'm too busy making the excel sheets and reports that are thrown at me. \n\n\nSo I was doing some coding in my spare time and through a friend I got an interview and eventually an offer as a software dev, where I will mostly be working in javascript. I'm not particularly passionate about software (like I once was) and my algorithm/analytical/coding skills are average at best, but I feel that I will learn more things and actually engage my mind with somthing instead of spending another year next to nothing. Some people are telling me I should stick to SOC as there's going to be a lot of money and opportunity in the future but I'm seeing all my buddies already making twice as much as me in software (and they're the guys I used to help out with their projects in college)\n\n\nI'm at a real crossroads here and my next decision could make/break my life.
