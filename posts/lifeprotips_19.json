Be transparent about your income, expenses, debts, and credit scores.

For exemple brown noise is more suitable for noises with low frequencies like loud walking from upstair neighbors. \n\nPersonally, I have been struggling with sleep for a few years as I had loud neighbors in my apartment with close to none soundproofing (I could hear the neighbors speaking, watching tv, walking, putting things on their table etc.). I finally bought a white noise machine on Amazon and that was one of my best purchase! I can’t really hear anything now when I’m in my bedroom. \n\nWhite/brown/pink noise machines can be found on Amazon, but you can also use a Bluetooth speaker and download an app on your phone or use YouTube. It might be worth mentioning that white (and other) noise are not for everyone and some people could find them disturbing. But if you are the type of person that like to sleep with the sound of a fan I’m sure you won’t have a problem. \n\n\nAnd for the South Park lover, I assure you the brown noise didn’t make me shat my pants :)",

It’s also much gentler on skin (for cleaning up blood after a surgery) and fabric (doesn’t bleach).\n\nNow, I’m talking about the 2% SOLUTION, not the scrub. Dilute with water until it’s a pretty sky blue, soak the stained area in it until saturated, then scrub with a toothbrush. Repeat as necessary. For light colored fabrics, you may need to follow up with a bit of hydrogen peroxide to get the last bits out. Always rinse out and wash the item afterward.

        "text": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to find a reliable way to measure my productivity. I'm currently using time estimates for my tasks. At the end of the day and throughout it, I look at the sum of estimated time for all completed tasks to evaluate my productivity. However, I've found that I often overestimate or underestimate how long they'll take, so I don't think it's a good method.  \n\nI've also tried tracking every minute of my day (used Toggle Track) using this formula: (*number of tasks I completed) / (total productive time)*. However, I've encountered a couple of issues with this approach.\n\nFirstly, I noticed the formula can sometimes motivate me to spend less time being productive since the less time I spend, the higher my productivity score. Obviously, this isn't the goal.  \n\n\nSecondly, different tasks have varying levels of difficulty, and this formula doesn't take that into account. I've thought about using time estimates to factor in difficulty, but not sure about that.\n\nLastly, I've had a hard time deciding what time I can count as productive. \n\nSo, I'm turning to you all for some advice. Have you found a good way to measure your productivity? I'm open to suggestions! Thank you in advance for your help!",
