We carry it to the end of our neighborhood and put it in the middle of a street that was about to get busy. After about 10 minutes my neighbor was heading out to work and he smashed right into it and it actually made a small explosion and we took off.

Well, I grabbed it and my friend and I ate the chips on our way to the mailbox and then when we passed by the car again on our way back, I placed the bag back, but I had some balloon string with me I was playing with earlier, so I tied a little bow on a rock and put it in the empty chip bag and put it back in the car. \n\n\n\nI know it's fairly harmless, I technically stole like .25 cents worth of chips. But, I often wonder what that person thought when they grabbed the chip bag and found a little rock with a bow tied on it. \n\n\n\nI remember telling my friend at the time it was to remind the car owner to close their windows, but honestly, it was just a lil shit thing to do.",

        "text": "I (19M) in my high school was not a very smart student and with having Asian parents, they would always control my financial spending. Not saying that they would never give me money whenever I asked, luckily I am from a well to do family but sometimes asking my parents for money would be a little awkward. Sometimes I would have an urge to just buy a McDonalds meal or Boba (I mean who wouldn't right? they are just soooo good). So every time I would have this urge I would look through my friends wallet and find a couple of dollars as they would carelessly leave their wallet out in the open and every time they would ask where their money went, I would always say 'idk' or act confused. I was always guilty when I did this but my cravings would always overcome this feeling LMAO. this went on for a couple of weeks and now, its been 5years since this happened and am still unable to forget this phase in my life, hopefully after this I am able to forget this and finally move on.  \n\n\nUpdate: I have since stopped doing this as I have matured way more than before",

Hes in a relationship and im just dating someone. But much recently Zi has been more physically close. Cuddling, holding hands, kissing my forehead and staring into my eyes which I can‚Äôt hold for long because i feel awkward with long eye contact. I wanted to think of this as normal just two best friends that enjoys physical contact just like we have done so in the past and when i reached out for advice on this from my other friend they just told me to not overthink it that Zi probably just feels comfortable enough to do all that. So, thats what i focused on but when I‚Äôm around Zi the intensity is just crazy and the sexual tension just drags the worse part of me. \nWhen we were out, I notice myself staring at Zi in a way that I shouldn‚Äôt that I just wanted to jump him, I noticed that I would act more sexual like biting my lips, and the way i‚Äôd sip my drinks. When Zi had enough drinks he switched seats and sat next to me, he laid his head on my back his hand wrapped around my waist and his other hand under my ass. At this point I just realized that I like having him near me. Zi then asked me whether id go home with him later which I did. We cuddled when we got there, and he‚Äôd caress my face and slowly we just inched closer, part of me didn‚Äôt want anything to happen that I would just go home after resting and then part of me who could hear his racing heart beat while my head rested on his chest made me think does he think of me more? When our face finally got close enough, I still didn‚Äôt dare move i kept my eyes closed I was getting nervous too, this isn‚Äôt going where i think it‚Äôs going right? Zi lifted my chin and we kissed, made out actually.. I just melted on to him.. he was the best kisser i‚Äôve ever had and we were just in sync as much as i loved the moment thoughts were racing in my mind ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt be doing this, he knows what he‚Äôs doing right, i cant let this go further‚Äù I knew, i knew what we were doing is wrong but after all the tension we had for each other was finally being released as we were kissing. However, When Zi was trying to go further i had to stop it i asked ‚Äúyou know what you‚Äôre doing right?‚Äù And we stopped he apologized and admitted he had feelings for me which went on and off because he did love his girlfriend more than anything. I do care and respect Zi, i do and im glad nothing went further because that would ngaw at us even further. We agreed to forget that that ever happened and continued our friendship as usual except with more boundaries. I really hope this doesn‚Äôt ruin our friendship and we do forget it and move on",

        "text": "Hi, not sure if this fits here, so delete if it doesn't. Apparently, I outed a high school friend.\n\nI am currently helping plan my 10-year high school reunion and we were given our class list and it was divided into thirds and the other 2 people helping and I were assigned people to contact about saving the date for the reunion. I sent out 40 text messages. I  just received a reply from someone and the message was a complete surprise. In this message, they said that it was a surprise to hear from me and that they never expected to and my doing so brought up a lot of feelings for them. He went on to say that I hurt them by outing them and I \"hurt a lot of people\" and to never contact them again and take them off the lists. A quick background- this person and I were in the theater programs together in high school. I went off to college and majored in it, I am 100% accepting of everyone under the sun. I have several friends who are queer, trans, gender fluid etc. \n\nOne day in school, all of the sudden a group of friends just stopped speaking to me. I stopped getting invited to parties and hang outs. I became increasingly isolated and only hung out with my friends at the barn and the older kids and my theater teacher. I don't remember a specific situation where I intentionally outed someone on purpose to hurt them or because I thought it was funny. I would NEVER do that. This was in either freshman or sophomore year in high school, so we were between 13-16 years old. I understand now why that group stopped speaking to me, but also am perplexed because for 10-12 years I've never known the real reason why. Until today. I feel absolutely horrible. Like I said, I don't remember doing this on purpose or to hurt them specifically. I honestly thought it was because I liked one of my friends ex-boyfriends and we kissed and texted a little bit. My whole thinking of that time has changed and am saddened to learn this. I never got to issue an apology to them or make amends or learn from this because I truly didn't know what happened. I do not doubt them and believe them when they said this to me. So, if nothing else, since I respect them not wanting contact, here is an apology they never got and certainly don't need from me anymore. \n\nI am so unbelievably sorry for doing that to you. I was careless in my words and thoughts and who I chose to share that private information to without your consent. I didn't think when sharing that information and it was not my information to share. I unfortunately do not remember this event specifically but you are completely correct and valid in your feelings. I am so sorry.",

        "text": "When I was in elementary my teacher had a box of toys and knickknacks for kids who behaved well and finished certain books she had a list of. Obviously I wasn't one of those kids...and to top it all off my parents would take hours to pick me up after school. Since I went to a school out of my district I didn't have the option of taking a bus. Sometimes I'd be there several hours after school waiting for my parents....there's only so much an 11 year old can do before his thoughts begin to wonder. And eventually I began going into classrooms that I would find open. Knowing my teacher had certain goods and I'd steal from every now n then I began to wonder how many teachers rewarded their students. And that's how things began getting out of hand. I would break into classrooms and steal anything I found of good use. Several teachers had Candy and other \"prizes\" from giga pets to my crushes picture ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  One time I got caught but luckily didn't have anything I had stolen. I made up some lie about someone was looking for said teacher and they sent me to look for her. The habbit kind of continued as I went to middle school but things weren't the same so I just stopped.... unfortunately my parents never stopped coming late and I developed other unhealthy habits.",
