        "text": "I had a realization this past week and I wanted to share it and hear what people think. I'm not a literary person so what I say might be kinda BS-y, and also long, but whatever :P Before you read this, I want to say that my goal is to see how BS-y this is, and also if anyone else relates to this :)\n\nI discovered Waiting for Godot as a sophomore in college; I enjoyed it very much, but couldn't quite place my finger on why. It faded from my memory until recently, when I pulled it out of my closet and watched it. Before this past week I had thought I might only be liking it because it was edgy, or because of the existential philosophy it contained, etc. However, I realized this past week that what might attract me to this particular play is much simpler and deeper than I originally thought; I think that this play speaks to me the most because it feels so very much like an ordinary day for me.\n\nWhen you watch a movie, you can feel the attempted atmosphere emitting from the television; perilous, danger, humour, happiness, and so on, depending on the film. But when the person is me and the film is Waiting for Godot, there isn't a shift; it's more than it just being a quiet, laid back film, it's that it jives with how I take in the world so well that it blends into the background. I just honestly relate to the feeling of this film in the sense that the mood of the film is the mood of my existence.\n\nThe statements I have made are things of which I am certain, but I was also trying to think of some stronger parallel, some stronger interpretive reason that I should be so similar in feeling to this film (hence the start of possible literary-interpretation-from-a-mathematician BS). The best thing I could come up with is the following odd-as-fuck interpretation, which might honestly only apply to me (but I want to know whether or not I'm alone here!)\n\nI feel close to Vladimir and Estragon because I feel as if, upon reflection, my thought process is similar to the manner in which they talk to each other. The buzz interchanged with the utter silence, the slight thoughts of suicide that honestly aren't even serious in nature, something just to \"pass the time\", the suspicion of outsiders, the confession that they are happier together but will continue to stick together anyways because in some sense each needs the other to validate their own existence. I think there were about 20-30 times throughout the movie that some exchange of theirs or another hit home to me, whether it was because of the dialogue or the mood during their exchange.\n\nContinuing this, I would need to give interpretation for everyone else. I think that Pozzo and Lucky are my \"bad\" and \"good\" emotions respectively. I don't feel things very often, so it fits well with the fact that they are almost never present in the film; they just sort of trot in and out as they please. Pozzo is the greed, the gluttony, the angst, cunning, kniving, pompous, proud, arrogant, while lucky is the silent happiness, the hope and the joy. \n\n(In case you couldn't already tell, I'm very much depressed; stable and ok, but depressed). \n\nI like this parallel because Pozzo overpowers Lucky, commands him, and Didi and Gogo are quick to follow him in disparaging the usefulness / goodness of Lucky. There are stronger parallels, but I'm running out of steam with my typing here.\n\nFinally, what is to be said of the young boy(s) and, most importantly, Godot? This took me a while to come up with, so this might be the square peg in the round hole that I needed to have a complete analysis, but I feel as if the boy is the in-between, the relay between myself (everyone else in their collective oddities and interpretations) and other people. To me this honestly fits well with my daily life, in the sense of overthinking what people think and being paranoid because you can never truly know what is going on to someone else, only what is happening in your own mind; that suspicion is reflected especially by Didi at the end of the second day. How can you even verify the existence of another, let alone that another has received the message you wish to send, if your own existence seems to so frailly depend on yourself to confirm?\n\nPlease tell me if I'm just full of crap / if you relate / anything else, because I honestly just enjoy this play no matter what :)",

        "text": "Wuthering Heights is something I'm glad I read. It's one of the most engaging and passionate novels I've read. To manage to create something readable and shapely out of uncontrolled passions is a real feat of sophistication that I think is rightly admired. I certainly liked that. \n\nComplexity is a good word to describe this novel. For me: Heathcliff's a tough kid, and I like that; Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw are really a match for each other; Heathcliff and Cathy have real self-destructive traits; Cathy should get a grip of herself; Cathy's marriage to Edgar Linton was not such a good idea; Heathcliff is a monster because he marries a woman he hates for the sole purpose of destruction; Heathcliff is nasty because he treats Linton Heathcliff and Hareton so meanly; Heathcliff still captures some of my sympathy because of his passion, which may have a redemptive quality to it; Heathcliff's desire for revenge admirably wanes; Heathcliff is a monster but a really lovelorn and intense one. I like the book because it allows me to feel all these things as the story progresses without any of these feelings being wrong.\n\nI don't think the characters here match the \"likable\" classification well, though Cathy Linton comes close to it at times, and Nelly Dean is our friendly neighborhood storyteller and it is partly her narration and partly the brilliance of Brontë's writing that keeps me engaged. The dialogue is theatrical and elevated and in the Romantic fashion, but I think for a novel about elevated feelings and intense passions, I think that \"artificiality\" is the right tone. \n\nI think in addition to being a masterpiece of story and passion, Wuthering Heights is really a work of technical genius; it's like The Scarlet Letter in using intense emotions in controlled form, though Brontë's style is much more complex and thus a grander achievement. I like how Lockwood's the frame narrator and Nelly Dean's the real storyteller. At the same time, Isabella Linton, Heathcliff, Zillah, Cathy get their parts. To do all of this in the span of several hundreds of pages and still keep me engaged—that's really admirable.\n\nI admit I need to reread it as I think that's the way Wuthering Heights will grow on me. After all, rereading led me to have a greater appreciation of Shakespeare's plays, of Homer's epics, of Milton's Paradise Lost, and more. \n\nI also should read more women writers. More of the Brontës, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Flannery O'Connor (I've read most of her stories and her novel Wise Blood), Donna Tartt, etc.—there's a lot to explore. \n\nI admit the second-generation stuff with Heathcliff being an outright monster could feel dragging and relentlessly unhappy at times, and I feel that when Cathy Earnshaw disappeared something else went away from the story. That being said, the book picks up a lot near the end, and Lockwood's last words that conclude Wuthering Heights have a special quiet brilliance.\n\nHighly recommended.",
