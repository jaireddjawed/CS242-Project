The oncoming lanes were completely empty, but off in the distance a lone white suburban was pulling out of an intersection from the other side of the road.\n\nas the only other car on the road ahead of me, I kept a bit of an eye on it. it pulled out from the intersection, turned his left signals as I watched him cross all 3 lanes and onto the turning lane.\n\nour trajectories were matching and we were relatively close to each other now, when I noticed his tires crossing passed the turning lane and into my oncoming lane with seemingly no reaction.\n\nImmediately I could tell something was horribly wrong, reality hit me quickly that I was about get myself into a head on collision with this giant monster of a vehicle. As I slammed on the breaks, knowing that wasn't going to be enough, and the fact I had other cars behind me, and knowing that the oncoming lane was completely empty I had no other choice but to take it. All in a split second I turned my steering wheel to the left, turning against his direction, rather than trying to avoid him through my other lanes, to my dismay, he finally reacted and turned away from my oncoming lane, so I turned completely to the left now.\n\nThis is about the moment where I covered my face and braced for impact, the rest of my maneuvers were made face down and by pure instinct and reflex (in short, I had no idea what happened the next 3 seconds). after swerving hard to the left onto oncoming lanes, Instinctively I swerved back to the right, and then back left again before finally coming to a complete stop (perfectly in the middle of the turning lane no less). I ending up behind the suburban that would have surely totaled my car and put me in the hospital.\n\nI finally raised my face slowly, I felt white as a ghost, I sat there frozen for about 2 minutes trying to regain my composure and realizing the gravity of what just happened, and that somehow I was alive and completely unharmed.. and so was my vehicle..\n\nTo this day, It makes me wonder just how close I came to having my most severe accident to date, creeps me to think about it.\n\nthe only humor I found in all this, is that a black guy who saw the whole thing, drove up next to my car and gave me the \"OK\" Hand gesture, like \"DAMN! That Was Niiiice!\"",

        "text": "I've been working delivery for about 4 years and I usually have no issues with my customers. I live in a pretty tame little town. But a few weeks ago I had to deal with an interesting character. \n\nShe called ahead to make a timed order for a birthday party. It's really early in the morning when she calls and I'm the one to take the order. She orders a dozen pies and tells me to set them for delivery at 12:30 PM. I read her order back to her and repeat the time twice. I know it's early and I'm not totally awake, I don't want to make a mistake. She has it set to deliver to a party place outside our delivery area that we have a special contract with.\n\nAround 15 minutes to noon we get a phone call, which I once again answer. It's that woman again and she's furious immediately, demanding to know where her pizzas are, and that she was expecting them at 11:30. I apologize right away and tell her she'd made the order for 12:30. I tell her that because her order is so large and her delivery destination is outside of our area, I can only guarantee that it will be there in around 40 minutes. I apologize over and over and tell her we'll do our best to get it to her ASAP.\n\nThen comes the \"Excuse me honey, I need to talk to your manager\" and I can just imagine her soccer mom haircut while I hand over the phone to my boss. She apologizes to her once again and reduces her total to half price for her trouble.\n\nWhile the pizzas are getting made, I check the security footage from that morning. Sure enough, the time I heard myself repeating to the woman was 12:30. Then comes the fun part: I'm the only one that can take the order to her. Our other driver had a flat tire. \n\nWhile driving out to the party I get a phone call from my manager letting me know that the woman had called twice more to complain further. She tells me to avoid talking while I'm there. I take it one step further: I ditch my name tag and I adopt a southern accent. I go in and keep my chatter to a minimum nonetheless, but I still get swarmed by the soccer mom (she looked exactly like I thought she would) and her friends. \n\nThe mom asks me if the tip is included already and I let her know that she doesn't need to tip, I understood there had been issues. She says, no, no, I was getting the short end of the stick. I was just the driver, not \"the bitch that took her order.\" She and her friends start bad-mouthing me to my face without even knowing it, and each of them pitch in to tip me. They go on and on, recounting the conversation she and I had had in increasing exaggeration, all the while shoving money in my hands even as I try to turn them down. \n\nAfter about five minutes of listening to what an unprofessional bitch I am I walk out with a $50 tip. \n\nIt was a good day. \n\nTl;dr: Lady gave us the wrong time, I had to deliver it, got called a bitch while getting a massive tip because I ditched my nametag.

I was going to ask him about why he ordered it that way, BUT, he took 7 minutes to come to the door, and only tipped a dollar. \n\nI'm really hoping he accidentally ordered his pizza like that (it was placed online) and that he hates it. LOL\n\nUpdate: The guy just called me on my cell phone to complain:\n\nMe: Hello, this is ----\n\nGuy: Hi you just delivered a pizza to me. I think you gave me the wrong one.\n\nI ask his address, it's him!! \n\nMe: Ok I remember you. I remember the pizza, too. We thought it was a little unusual.\n\nHim: Yes, it is! It has half with nothing on it! No sauce, no cheese. It's just blank!\n\nMe: We made your pizza exactly the way it was ordered. For that half it said minus cheese, minus chicken, minus sauce, etc. Since you placed it on our website that way, we followed the instructions to the letter. But that said, you are calling the wrong person foe this issue. You need to call the store. I just make deliveries. \n\nHim: But you gave me the wrong pizza! This is the third time this has happened. \n\nMe: :o \n\nMe: No, I'm sorry if that is not what you intended to order, but we gave you exactly what you ordered. Maybe the web ordering is a bit complicated, and you need to try to put it in a different way. Again, you need to talk with the store. \n\nHim: This is ridiculous, isn't there someone else I can talk to besides you? \n\nMe: Yes, if you call the store, not my personal cell phone while I'm out making deliveries. \n\nFinally I convince him to look up the number and call the store about it. \n\nSad ending- They remade it the way he intended to order it and sent it out for free. Everyone was glad I explained to him why he was wrong, though. ",

We had pretty big crowds and lots of the customers were either regulars or semi regulars and were well known to us. Because there was drinking going on about 11:00pm we would order 20 or so pizzas from one of our local pizza joints, to help our customers maintain through the night. When they were delivered we would distribute the pizzas like we were dealing cards, one to each table and we would save one for the band. One of our delivery pizza stores would have the pizzas in big insulated carriers but our order was so large it took two insulated bags. The pizza deliverer was a cute little girl who was having a busy night and had to carry the pizza bags one at a time into the bar. While she was bringing in the first bag someone reached in her vehicle, grabbed the second bag, and disappeared. She was broken hearted because the income was so important to her and she was afraid she might lose her job. She came crying and explained the situation and said her boss would make her pay for the pizzas and also the expensive bag. I got so angry that that happened at my establishment that I went up on the stage and explained to the crowd what happened and that we were going to pass a hat to not only pay for the missing pizzas we were going to make sure that the bag got covered also. I was so proud of my customers when the hat got brought to me because the missing pizzas were paid for, which I normally covered, but the bag was paid for and the tip was well over $100.00. It gave the delivery girl something else to cry about. ",

        "text": "I had a particularly unenjoyable delivery recently. I was driving along returning from a delivery, listening to K.Dot and basically chillin' as I usually do. There was this car ahead of me driving particularly slowly, which is fine because my car has that active cruise thing that matches the speed of the car ahead and frankly I didn't wanna be at the store any time soon. My car's cruise has the ability to set how far away to follow the car ahead, which I rarely change from about the middle distance, but I'm guessing that was too close for the other car because suddenly and randomly, the car ahead slowed even more, then turned off the road. My car accelerated up to the speed limit (ok maybe 5 over), and the other car got back behind me. Happens sometimes, I've found, but I tend to not really care. \n\nThen things got strange. This other car then decided to not only tailgate me, but miscalculate the distance between cars and actually hit my car - lightly - while accelerating back to me. Considering this an accident, I start to pull over. This other person, however, decided that instead of trading insurance info or anything, throwing a half full coffee at my car was clearly the best solution. She literally pulled up beside me, threw her cup at my car, and drove off. Nu-uh, lady. That's not gonna fly. One of the best things about my car is that it accelerates VERY quickly - so much so that my nickname for it is 'hypersedan'. So, I get RIGHT behind her and call the local police. I tell them what happened, where, and the car and plate number. Not sure what they'd do about it, but by this point we were close to the store, so I just turned off and got my next delivery.\n\nMy next delivery happened to go to a nearby area. What did I see? Nothing other than that car pulled over by the cops. No idea how they caught her, but it was definitely the same car and plate. Even more surprisingly, a cop came by the store later asking for me. We have cops come through all the time, and most know and are friends with the boss and owner, so us drivers get a bit of slack when it comes to speeding and such (I was literally told that 40 in a 25 is a-ok if we have the topped on our car). Apparently we also have the benefit of the local PD helping us out, as he asked if he could take pictures of my cars damage (literally just a bit of tan tint on the driver side and a few scratches on the rear bumper) for a report against the other car. I dunno what, if anything, will come of it, but that was super cool of the cop! \n\nMoral of the story: don't fuck with the pizza girl :) Especially not the pizza girl who works at a place where all the local cops go.",

        "text": "Gotta love the regulars. You immediately know where you're going, their orders are often the same and in my case they tipped better than the average stranger. \n\nThen you have those other kind of \"regulars\". Those customers with the specific instructions for delivery. I'm not talking about jumping through hoops here, typically just a small set of steps for completing the transaction.\n\nWe had a few customers like this, but the first is the one that sticks out the most in my memory. When my manager first sent me out he gave me these instructions as if it was just routine to him at that point. \n\n- There will be cash under the dog bowl.\n- Keep $5 for tip and leave the rest under the bowl\n- Knock on the door as you leave so she knows you made the delivery\n- Don't mind the barking dog, it's locked up\n\nSimple enough. On my first delivery the woman shouted \"thank you\" after I knocked and was walking back to my car. She did indeed have what sounded like a very large dog in there with her barking from the moment I walked up until I left. A week or so later I had the same delivery and it went down in a similar fashion except she never again said anything after I knocked and that's how it went for a few weeks with this \"regular\". Dog bowl cash, dog barking, knock on door, GTFO. Each time it went this way. \n\nThat is until I fucked it up. On this latest drop off, which was probably the 4th or 5th by this time I left the incorrect change and I was already back in my car when I realized it. I took too much cash and had to go back. I didn't think to call or wait or anything, I kinda just blanked and walked back to the apartment ASAP. Right as I turn the corner from the alley way I see this woman, naked as a jay bird on her front step gathering her deliveries. Right as she's in full bent over /squat mode picking up the pizza she realizes I'm there and recoils faster than a snake back into her apartment. Meanwhile the dog started barking up a storm again as soon as that door slammed shut. I immediately pulled a 180, froze still and with my back turned apologized loudly so she could hear me from inside. I told her I took too much change or something and was just leaving some cash. She responded in a understandably shocked and nervous sounding tone with a simple \"Ohh, ok\". I quickly dropped that cash and GTFO of there. It was just so weird and I felt so bad about it I was just kinda beside myself for awhile. When I got back to the shop I told my manager what happened and he just laughed it off saying \"She's weird\". My manager was always a bit unsympathetic towards our customers. That was the last time we ever got an order from the nudist shut-in dog lover. ",

What I want to know is, does Papa Johns have a policy that lets managers compensate drivers for gas when they drove out to a no-show delivery? I already lost close to $30 in tips today, it was extremely painful handing back $5 at the end of the night, is it even worth asking my general manager about?\n\nIt seems pretty ridiculous that I'm expected to cover for gas that I used on business for Papa Johns, it's not my fault they took an order from someone who was a no show, especially when I'm not even being payed minimum wage.",

People are out and about getting groceries, or maybe just about to get off of work, and they call and order delivery for their house thinking they'll beat us there for sure, especially when they've been told there's a long wait time.\n\nThe thing is, those wait times aren't definitive. More often then not we WILL be there earlier than you expect, and it's never fun to be stuck at the door of an empty house wondering if we have the wrong address or if doorbell is broken (side note: is it just me or do way too many people not have working doorbells?).\n\nI mean at the very least, make sure your cell phone is on and at the ready. I don't think I've ever once been in this situation and actually had the customer answer their phone when I've tried to call. When this happens, we don't have much choice except to take your order back to the store and wait for YOU to call us.\n\nOn this note, please also don't go into some part of your house where you can't hear someone at the door. Personally, if I was expecting someone to show up at my house in any minute, I probably wouldn't think it a good moment to venture into my backyard or sound-proof basement for a long period of time.\n\nAlthough I have had people tell me ahead of time in the delivery remarks to call their phone for that very reason. That's definitely 100% fine. Just be sure to let us know xD",

        "text": "First of all this is my first post on this subreddit. I've been a lurker since I made my account and I've posted comments here and there but here's my first official post! I hope you all enjoy it!\n\nBackground on myself: \nI've been a driver for a local mom and pop pizza place for almost 3 years now. I had dated my bosses daughter and after we broke up his daughter had offered me a job which I accepted. I left at one point to try a different career (only about 6 months) which I hated and recently came back to deliver until I can apply for a job in my career field.\n\nNow onto the story! (May be NSFW I'm really not sure of the rules or the context here)\n\nSo this happened roughly a week and a half ago but today I was reminded of the story and thought you guys (and girls) might enjoy it!\n\nSo as I said I work in a mom and pop shop so we have our fair share or weird delivery places and this just happens to be one of them. I live in North eastern Pennsylvania and we have a fairly popular nudist camp within about 5 miles of our shop and we get a lot and I meal A LOT of calls from them in the summer. Usually this isn't a problem because most of our customers have the commons curtesy to either meet us at the gate or wear cloths when they answer the door. \n\nAnyway, it was a Wednesday and I'm the only driver working on Wednesday so I had quite a few deliveries to make. I get back to the shop after taking 3 or so and find out I have a delivery to the nudist camp. I usually know our usual customers from there but this address was new so I said fuck it what's the worst that can happen?!\n\nSo I take the delivery and I get to the gate and call the guy and told him I was there. He said to take it right to his house and he guided me via phone call to where I needed to be (it was fairly deep into the camp where I had never been). So I get to the door and ring the bell. \n\nNow the weird and uncomfortable part.\n\nAs the door opens a 65-70 year old man comes out butt ass naked. Walks out of his doorway into the sunlight with his man sword swinging freely in the light summer breeze. He looks and me and says \"about damn time\". I was stunned. I had never had a naked guy answer the door before. I mean I have nothing against them enjoying being naked and I won't judge them for it but I figured they'd be understanding of us drivers not being use to it. Anyway, after I tel him his total and hand him MY OWN PEN and his slip to sign he them scratches his man area and takes both from me proceeds to sign the slip. Then he begins to strike up a conversation of how it is to live there and asked if I had ever visited. I quickly said no and said politely \"being nude really isn't my thing\". After tipping me a solid $10 he then said \"don't forget where I am next time. I'll see you next week.\" \n\nI quickly got in my car and left.\n\nDuring the whole exchange I maintained the most solid eye contact I had ever in my life.\n\nHave any of you ever had an experience like this before or am I the only one?\n\nThanks for reading and if you guys would like I have a lot more stories about that place and also other awkward deliveries!\n\nTLDR; Took a delivery to a nudist camp and my customer opened the door butt ass naked with his tic-tac hanging out in the wind. Gave me a solid tip tho(and not his tip).",

        "text": "So, using a new account because I want to share stories that may or may not be a little more specific and yada yada yada, so here I am.\n\nThis particular story takes place over a year ago after we had locked up and were finishing up the closing duties for the night. I was a fairly new GM at the time, and my store was, no joke, \"The Benchwarmers\" of our franchise. Seriously, most of my crew probably needed to wear a helmet. I was reminded of this particular story and figured it would find appreciation here. Of course, this is only one story from a more mild example of what I dealt with at that store.\n\n\nSo anyways, earlier that shift my Co-GM mentioned that the fryer oil needed to be changed that night. No problem, told my 3 closing drivers  what was up and they were on top of it. So here I am, later that night, doing my paperwork in the office while the guys changed out the oil real quick. \n\n\nI'm done with everything and I'm closing out the computer, that's when I hear it. The tone of voice, that almost panicked way of calling my name. I closed my eyes and sighed, mother fuckers fucked some shit up again. I leave the office and head for the fryer, before I can even turn the corner in the kitchen I see what the problem is... instead of oh, I don't know, slowly letting the oil drain into the little movable bin these guys opened up the valve full throttle splashing all but maybe a cup's worth of oil onto the floor of the kitchen. \n\n\nSo the age old question of how many Pizza Hut delivery drivers does it take to change the oil in WingStreet? The answer is obviously more than 3 of the fuckers. We were done guys, all they needed to do was drag the bin outside to the oil dump and we were done! \n\n\nFrom there the details are fuzzy, I either asked \"Why\" or \"How\". To which I got a great story about how they felt their actions were justified and that this was just a totally unavoidable incident, to which I tell them to clean it up. \n\n \nWe, mostly they, cleaned it up best as possible and ended up only being about an hour late to get out, I think. However, the floor was ever so slightly more slippery than usual for a few days after. \n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this little peak into the circus that was the B-Team! Our motto in the store was \"We try\", and dammit if we didn't try some of the time! \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Asked for oil to be changed, my drivers used the old oil to polish the floors\n\n\n\n\n",

I know what it's like to take a small order to a house and walk away with little to no tip.\n\nSo, backstory is that I moved into my house a couple months ago now, and my wife and I ordered a pizza from one of the big chains (think stuffed crust chain.)  \nWell, the driver was great, got here right on time, and I gave my usual $5-6 tip.  \nTurned out that the girl who took my order over the phone didn't include one of the toppings. No big deal, so I called the store to let them know. I wasn't expecting anything, but I always liked to know when I screwed up so I can make it right, especially for regulars.  Well, I ended talking to a manager (supposedly.) and she said they could remake the pizza (which was still tasty, so I declined) or add a $15 credit to my account. Cool, that's pizza for next time.  \nFew weeks later, my wife calls in to order, expecting to use that credit. No credit found. Not under my wife's number, my number, address, nothing. No big deal, it wasn't expected from before anyways. Proceed to order, we like the pizza. Same ~$5-6 tip, same on-time.  \nNow to tonight's story.  \nWife took our daughter to a park to watch a movie with a big group of people. Cool. My baby is in bed and I'm hungry. Receive offer in email for bacon stuffed crust pizza.. Sounds good. Go to order online, it's $16 after everything! Okay, whatever, it's just me and I want a treat. Ordered the pizza, 45-60 minute wait time quoted. Driver was here in less than 25 minutes grinning and being overly polite. Also noticed it's the driver that delivered the time before last. Cool. $22 total, leaving $5 for tip.  \nLesson? Tip your drivers well if you're a regular, and you'll get pizza in half the time on a busy night.",

I can't tell you how many times I was sent to the local hospital (over 2000 employees) with only a first name.  No last name, no department, no floor number, no information other than \"Scott\".  This was especially painful when they called from the hospital phone rather than their cell phone as the phone number printed on the delivery ticket would route to the information desk at the hospital.  The women who worked at the information desk would cringe when they saw us walk in the door:\n\n&gt; \"Hello! I have a delivery for Scott\"\n&gt;&gt;\"Scott who?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\"Uh, I just have Scott, I'm sorry\"\n\nSometimes we'd have to wait for 20-30 minutes while they called from department to department to find out who ordered the food.  Despite several attempts to explain our predicaments to the people that took the orders, the problem was never fixed.  Just my rant for the day.",

I had all my tools from make table ready to go back and wash, cause I figured nobody would be getting anything so close to closing. And not only did this monster order three pizzas, two were stuffed, which I had to fully prep. That probably doesn't sound too horrible, but I'm relatively new and still somewhat slow at prepping stuffed. So I have decided to crown this guy or girl as the king of the last minute assholes. ",

The streets were flooded so bad that certain intersections were blocked off by police. While attempting to make deliveries and eventually returning back to the store, I had some serious damage to my car. I lost a lot of protective parts under my car like the splash guard, as well as my check engine light coming on and my car not going in reverse and having trouble shifting. My question is am I totally responsible for this damage financially? Or is Jimmy John's liable to help pay in any way? Has anyone experienced something like this before? We actually stopped delivering based on my reccomendation when I returned to the store, but the damage was already done. How should I approach this situation?",

She opens the door, snatched the slip out of my hand, then their dog slips through the door and starts jumping all over me and won't stop no matter how many times I shoo it away. It's getting paw prints all over my shorts. The ladies both know the dog is doing this and occasionally shout out \"Malkovich! No!\", while trying to figure out how to sign the receipt for a while. Not sure what was so hard about a signature, but they hand it back to me 5 minutes later, as I'm still holding the pizzas and using my foot to try to shoo away the dog. And wouldn't you know it, no tip.\n\nAs I'm driving back to the store, I'm just staring at this credit card slip. Fuming. Asking myself how these ladies could be so rude, let their dog jump all over me and get my clothes messed up, and not tip me after they wasted my time when I could've been on an actual tipping order.\n\nAs I'm looking at the slip in disbelief, kind of trying to remember that address, I look up for a second, and a car is there now. Not enough time. Smack into the back of the car. It wasn't terrible, I was only going like 5 mph but there was still a little visible damage and he still wanted to exchange information.\n\nMoral of the story is, don't let a stiffer get you down. Don't let that effect you, because more often than not, it usually seems to even out. Now I'm left with being stiffed on a delivery and an insurance claim to deal with. When it could've just been the no tip.",

Luckily the damage to both vehicles was minor. We made a police report and took pictures.\n\nWhen I called my insurance, they told me that there was an exclusion on my policy when delivering goods for hire. Which basically means that, unless the store's insurance covers us, we are driving around uninsured.\n\nIs this type of exclusion standard on insurance policies? Should the store's policy cover us? I talked to the store manager and he seemed to think that it wouldn't, although he is looking into it.

I ask the guy if he has the right address and what the order says on the receipt. He looks it over with a confused face so I say \"I ordered from ________(name of pizzeria I ordered from), that's you right?\"\n\nAnd he's like \"Oh, no I work at ________\" (Different pizzeria nearby).\n\nSo I'm like wtf, how is that even possible. I hand him back the food and he calls up his pizzeria. Somehow he came to the wrong address, I don't know what address he even had written down, but he ended up at my house soon after I had ordered from a different pizzeria. He says \"Sorry for the confusion\" or whatever and walks back to his car. As he's getting into his car the other delivery guy pulls up in front of my house. \n\nI still have no idea how that happened. He didn't go to one of my neighbors houses with the order or anything, he just drove away. The timing of it all was so bizarre.\n\n",

So I pull out our map that shows all of the different store locations in the city, and ask for the nearest major intersections to his house. \n\nApparently, this is a big freakin' deal.\n\n**\"This is the store that came up when I entered my address online!\"**\n\n\"Sorry sir, I can't say why it did that. But I can direct you to your nearest store.\"\n\n**\"I never have this problem when I order from Domino's!\"** (I work for Papa Johns btw)\n\n\"My apologies. But I'm afraid I can't help if I don't know your streets.\"\n\n**\"Fine. It's X Street and Y Avenue.\"**\n\nWell okay, I think. I know X Street, that's definitely north of our store. Trouble is, it's looooong and goes through the entire city. There's like four or five possible stores. Unfortunately, I've never even heard of Y Avenue. I ask other employees. They don't know. I try to pull up the intersection on Google Maps, which is instead directing me to a *whole other state*. As I'm researching this, I'm being awkwardly silent (I mean what am I gonna say?). The whole time, the customer is berating me.\n\n**\"Come on man, what's taking so long?\"** and **\"It's like you guys are stuck in the 19th century.\"**\n\nSo finally, all I can do is ask for ANOTHER nearby intersection to help me out. He screams \"FORGET IT\" and hangs up. Obviously, this guy is an asshole, plain and simple. But what baffles me is that this is far from the first time this has happened. There's a guy who lives in a whole other *town* and calls our store like two or three times a year, insisting we have definitely delivered to him before. Each time, he is a jerk about it. There have been others just like him, getting legit angry at us for not delivering 15 miles out of our area, refusing to let us direct them elsewhere.\n\nI just can't understand this behavior.

He just stares at me blankly so I did the only thing I could and just held up the food and shrugged (they didn't order a pizza so it wasn't as obvious, just a bag of wings and stuff). He gets up all annoyed, and I said I'm guessing you didn't order this. He goes \"why didn't you just knock on the front door?\" and I said the little kid with the basketball told me to come to the side house. As I'm telling him this I point to where the little kid was, who was conveniently no longer there. I looked around and there was literally no one outside anymore. Great, thanks kid. The guy just gives me a weird look, and tells me to knock on the front door, so I do. \n\nNo one answers. He comes out of the side house again yelling \"they didn't answer?\" I shrug again. He rushes over, mumbling about no one ever answering the door. So he opens the door and just screams  \"HEY, SOMEONE COME GET THE GOD DAMN FOOD AT THE DOOR!\" He then politely tells me I can go inside and wait, they'll be right there. He held the door open, so not really thinking I just walk in and say thanks. As I'm standing in this family's foyer I realize, this dude just fucking screamed at the top of his lungs at someone to answer the door, and he basically just left me alone inside this poorly lit (important later) house. As I was waiting I had that *oh fuck, now I have to explain this* moment. So after about 20 seconds I finally hear someone emerging from a room down the hallway, and a middle aged woman appears. As she gets closer I realize, she doesn't even see me. Like I said, the house was basically completely dark. I figure I ought to say something, because I don't want to her to run into me.\n\nThinking fast, I say \"hey how's it going\" and I kid you not this woman nearly jumps out of her shoes and drops all of the money (she counted out all the change... yeah) on the floor. She goes \"Jesus fucking Christ what are you doing in here scaring me like that!\" Then a few small dogs hear this woman shriek and come lumbering in, barking their heads off at me. She's trying to calm the dogs down now while trying to pick up all the money off the floor. I'm sweating profusely at this point. I apologize over and over, saying the guy in the side house told me to just wait inside, so I did. She's still cursing under her breath, giving me the money aggressively as I give her the food. I kept apologizing and she kept saying it's fine but I could tell she was super pissed. \n\nSo I obviously wasn't getting a tip, hence the change, but at that point I was just happy to get the fuck out of there. I told her to have a nice day and got back to my car, just trying to process everything that just happened. The whole ordeal lasted about a minute but it felt like 10. And wouldn't you know it, ol' Junior with his fucking basketball is a few houses away just dribbling and staring at my car. He waved, so I waved back. Little did he realize the mayhem he released upon his house, or if it even was his house. I didn't even care at that point.",
