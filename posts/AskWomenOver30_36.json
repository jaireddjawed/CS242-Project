It‚Äôs not all me though. \n\nFor example my cousins invited me out. They called me about twenty minutes before they wanted to go. I was keen to join them despite the late late notice. Then I scoffed my food down so I was ready at the time they said they would pick me up. \n\nHalf an hour later they arrive. I get it, it‚Äôs hard to be on time with kids but it‚Äôs annoying. They are always late, same thing happened the day before. They know it and they just don‚Äôt care. \n\nThen I overheard my other family discussing my plans to go home. I‚Äôve somehow upset them because I didn‚Äôt visit them as a stopover which I just don‚Äôt have the energy for. \n\nPmdd and hashimotos makes me apathetic, tired and flat. I just want someone to watch a movie and chill with but my family never do such things. I can‚Äôt relax or be myself and if I don‚Äôt seem particularly happy or loving they get so offended. \n\nBut the alternative is being home alone and lonely. Just frustrated with this whole mess.",

It is no secret that my boss and male coworkers are all buddies - they golf together every other weekend, go out for lunch, etc. I‚Äôve never been invited - which I have come to terms with.\n\nHowever, I do get frustrated when they are presented with opportunities that I am not. One example is that they were both asked to interview candidates for a future intern. (Funny thing is that I am the only one who has actually interviewed &amp; hired people in previous workplaces). So it‚Äôs a bit awkward to have them all meet in a room 10 feet away and interview while I‚Äôm left at my desk. Another example is they were offered the chance to formally meet and talk with our CEO during a visit. I didn‚Äôt know about this until I overheard it being discussed. It is important to note that I do not question my performance being a factor, I receive fantastic feedback and have never had a discussion that would lead me to believe it is due to this.\n\nSorry, I had to rant.

When I interject to *nicely* tell him these things he *understands*, but he doesn't seem able to stop.  He will sometimes talk over me to keep going.  If he doesn't interrupt me interrupting him, he will pick up his story/point and finish it anyway, though in that situation he will do it more briefly.\n\nAny insights into what this behavior is about?\n\nHe doesn't have a life aside from his job, so I know that he is lonely.  I've been there.  I like social phone conversations.  When calls I put him on speaker phone and look at the time.  I have zero problems diplomatically stopping the conversation after 30 minuets if he is boring me.  Basically, it isn't a problem, I am just curious as to what is going on.",

I didn‚Äôt apply and it‚Äôs in a different department from my own. I have a license and a specialty and this new department deals with subjects other than my specialty and does not require use of my license. It would be a lot more work, a fair bit of travel, and lot of stress. Essentially it‚Äôs a high level manager position and I sense a good deal of the job will be cleaning up messes, organizing funding, and probably dealing with personnel issues. The problem is - I‚Äôve never had any desire to manage anyone. That sounds like a bit of a headache. I like the work I do currently. I‚Äôm lucky and grateful in that I don‚Äôt need the extra money. But the promotion is a huge bump in prestige. I worry about regrets in life (who doesn‚Äôt, I know!). There are probably a million other issues, pros, and cons, but I‚Äôm more so curious if anyone has turned down a promotion like this and, if so, were there any regrets? I guess I‚Äôm just grasping at data points here. Any insight or stories would be hugely appreciated. \n\n(For more context, I was offered this promotion last year and turned it down. They have now reached back out and asked me again.)",

        "text": "I‚Äôm unfortunately in a pretty upsetting position. My youngest brother (27m) is a gigantic wall of a man who lives with my parents. My parents have infantilized him to the point he can barely function as an adult. He‚Äôs never had a responsibility or felt a consequence and has not goals and feels no gratification in life. This in itself is it‚Äôs own tragedy, but is something that I have tried to get through to my parents for years and have failed. I‚Äôm the oldest daughter and bore responsibility for my younger siblings from a young age. \n\nMy youngest brother has always had an issue with anger. He has openly expressed a hatred towards women and quite a racist view of the world (thank you Andrew Tate and your ilk for fanning this fire). I‚Äôve had to distance myself from him. But, a while ago he started therapy and got a pretty decent job and it seemed like he was actually getting better‚Ä¶. but I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. He‚Äôs just gotten better at hiding it.\n\nHe has a girlfriend, who without going into too much detail has some specific vulnerabilities. We were actually quite surprised when they started dating as my brother has never displayed any kind of patience and she is someone who inherently requires a lot of patience in her every day life. I feel sick to my stomach that this didn‚Äôt raise my antenna immediately.\n\nThey‚Äôve been dating for a few years and all seemed fine, until I was pulled aside at a family gathering by my other SIL who saw an opportunity to finally get me alone to tell me what‚Äôs been going on.\n\nYoungest brother‚Äôs girlfriend has been calling her in the middle of the night for almost a year now. Crying and confused and scared. There hasn‚Äôt been any physical abuse (yet) as far as I know, but the mental and emotional abuse and control is vile. It makes my skin crawl some of the things he‚Äôs said and done to her. He‚Äôs an awful vile person who has her completely under his control. She‚Äôs afraid to leave him. She reached out to my SIL because she thought there was a chance my other brother could get through to him. I‚Äôm not sure if he ever tried to talk to him.\n\nI‚Äôm proud of how my SIL has been handling this. Listening to her, being there for her, never telling her what to do, never gossiping about it with others, but making sure to screenshot texts and time stamp everything. It finally became too much for her to handle on her own (and should have never been her responsibility alone), and that‚Äôs when she pulled me aside.\n\nI ended up feigning an illness to skip Christmas because I couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of having to be in the same room as him pretending like nothing was wrong. It took a few weeks to finally find a chance to sit down with girlfriend, because my brother monitors her phone, so I never texted her or called her first out of safety and had to wait for her to reach out to SIL again to have her redirected my way. We finally made a time to meet close to her while he was at work and she broke down and told me everything. I was so afraid she wouldn‚Äôt trust me with this, because why would you trust anyone connected to your abuser, but I felt relieved when she opened up. She‚Äôs so afraid of breaking up my family.\n\nI assured her that I believe her, none of this is her fault and that she‚Äôs done nothing wrong. That my brother is sick and he needs a lot of help, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse any of his behavior. He‚Äôs abusing her, and even if he‚Äôs my brother he‚Äôs an abuser first right now and I refuse to be party to that. We talked about a game plan to keep her safe. I didn‚Äôt tell her she has to leave him now if she doesn‚Äôt want to, but that I can‚Äôt change his behavior and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll make the choice to change himself. \n\nShe‚Äôs so far in it she‚Äôs worried about leaving him on his own because he‚Äôs made her feel his emotional well-being is her responsibility and that he might end up hurting himself if she leaves. I reassured her that, as awful as I think he is (I didn‚Äôt say that out loud), he would never be left out to dry and will have support, and that it has never been her responsibility to put aside her own well-being for the sake of his. And, if he ever threatens to kill himself she has every right to take him seriously and tell him she‚Äôs going to get emergency services involved. And that if she ever feels like he‚Äôs an immediate danger to himself or anyone else she should call 911, and if she‚Äôs not comfortable doing that she can call me and I will.\n\nShe‚Äôs not ready to leave him. She gave me permission to talk to my family about what has been going on so that at least he can‚Äôt hide his behavior anymore. I haven‚Äôt done this, because he‚Äôs confessed to her that he is paranoid and constantly thinks people are talking about him. He‚Äôs mentioned daydreaming about killing people that have wronged him, he‚Äôs talked about not wanting to wake up and wanting her to not wake up either so that they ‚Äúcan meet somewhere where they can find peace together‚Äù (I have screenshots of this and other things). While I know this all sounds extremely dangerous and scary, I don‚Äôt know if this constitutes as an imminent threat? I‚Äôm worried if he finds out people have actually been talking about him he might snap.\n\nI‚Äôve sent her the DV hotline link, I‚Äôve talked to my own therapist about this, and I have a call scheduled with a local sexual assault crisis center I used to volunteer with to see if they have any local resources that might be helpful. Other than that I don‚Äôt know what else to do or if I‚Äôm actually doing any of this right.\n\nI don‚Äôt want her to get hurt and I don‚Äôt want my family to end up in the news‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm taking this deadly seriously but I‚Äôm worried my family won‚Äôt and will fall back into the excuse that I‚Äôm just being dramatic.\n\nWhat would you do or what do you wish others had done?",

We have been out on a brunch date once, have talked on the phone once each week, and send a handful of texts nearly every day.

He also knows younger counterparts of a hiking community I've connected with through Meetup. So far, I've only really hiked with the senior-aged members, as the younger members this guy knows have broken off into their own group and rarely utilize Meetup. \n\nAll that to say, I definitely am no into this guy romantically. I enjoy his company and would genuinely like to be friends, particularly because it seems he has \"ins\" to people I want to get to know better. He's asked for another date this Sunday, and has also extended an invite to a party next Friday with the young hikers group. How would you all handle this situation? He seems like a genuinely kind person who may be open to friendship, as he's friends with other women. I don't know how to convey a genuine desire for friendship, though. Could use some pointers. Do I tell him over the phone? In person? He's very mature and extroverted, so seems like he could handle an in-person chat about the direction of our acquaintanceship. But maybe it'd be better for him to receive this info over text, so he doesn't need to have a \"live\" response? \n\nCan you tell I'm a classic over-thinker ü§£",

Thought I would pick brains here for some advice. \n\nAfter months of fruitless interviewing post a horrible layoff, I've finally gotten an offer from a medium size fairly well-known tech company as a staff-level IC (individual contributor). For context, I am the hiring manager's top candidate, I have a rare technical skillset, and they seem super eager to hire me (which is not something I experience often, if ever). I feel like I have a lot of leverage here.\n\nI questioned the level at whcih I was hired, because while I'm currently the same level at an even bigger company, my peer (male, of course) at my previous company who was the same level as me and who also recently got an offer was hired one level up from the leveled I was offered. For some context, tech is sadly pretty hierarchical at big companies like this, and there can be huge differences in comp and responsibility between levels.\n\nThe hiring manager was receptive adn made me a proposal: They'd be wiling to uplevel me keeping my compensation the same, but the tradeoff is that of course I'd have to prove myself at a higher level in the review cycle within the first 6 months of joining. Also they said that if I join at a lower level, I would enjoy a softer landing, and also that I could get promoted in the first 6-12 months when I'm ready (something my last boss promised me that actually turned out to be 10x harder than he made it seem).\n\nI'm really conflicted about what to do. My brain is telling me that this is a huge opportunity to grab a high title (I'd be a Director), which is very difficult anywhere at a company of this size, but I'm a bit worried by the additional scope the hiring manager laid out for me which seems to be on the surface three times the scope of the originally offered level.\n\nI've left a few things vague, but does anyone have any advice on what to do or how I should approach my decision making here? i've never been in a sitaution like this before.

I am not excited about this.\n\nI guess I'd love to hear I am not the only one, get reassurance I am doing the right thing, and any advice from people who have gone through similar.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "So started working remotely for a global company 2 months ago. It's been really stressful since I joined  them, although I've been doing this work for almost 8 yrs I feel that I am back to zero and everything I've learned from my previous work are gone because they do different process in this company that gets me very confuse every time. And to make it worse, I work alone most of the time since I am in a different timezone, all my team mates are on the other side of the world, so if ever I don't know how to do shit I have to research on my own coz there is no one to help me. So lately I've been feeling more anxious than usual because the other colleugue who started with me and also way younger than me has been getting alot of appreciation from my bosses and also colleagues, its really hurting me because I always try to do overtime so I can finish work and not leave extra work to my team but they don't even acknowledge or thank me for it. Although my boss and team leader would message me in private letting me know how much they appreciate what I do and they are happy with my performance but still I feel I am not doing enough for them. I am also an introvert so even though its just a work chat, I don't actually share alot of opinions or suggestions because I only want to do the work coz I know it's what that really matters. I've been thinking maybe people hate me because I don't engage with them that much, but I am not very outspoken or articulate, I'm scared that if I share my ideas it will be shut down. I feel all my colleaugues are very smart when it comes to workchat and I feel very intimidated with them.",

        "text": "Hi there--- **What are your thoughts?**  \\--- I ramble sometimes so if you want to skip over the details, just focus on the bolded sentences.\n\nTopic #1 - Egg-freezing! \n\nI am single, 34 years old, with no (may never again) partner in my life. \n\n\\*I'm a bit PTSD from my wannabe forever after and I never want to feel that vulnerable again--maybe I'll fall in love again. But I won't hold my breath. It only takes one person to screw it up for everyone else right? PTSD from a broken heart is real--- please don't lecture me on opening up dating apps\\*\n\nI have many student loans and a manageable credit card debt with my car loan almost paid off. I was an idiot and found Dave Ramsey only after the fact but anyway, my whole point is--- I'm not debt-free but I want to freeze my eggs. I'm willing to take out another loan as well and I'm also going to start a 2nd job (which has great opportunities for over-time) very soon. I'm hoping to pay off as much debt as possible and apply for the FutureFamily loan again but I'm not banking on only that lender. I got denied due to \"high revolving balance\" but I am confident I can clear those balances out in about a year living on \"beans and rice and rice and beans\" (those who know about Dave Ramsey will know why I'm quoting that) working my a$$ off. \n\n**Has anyone in the same situation (has student loan debt or just debt in general but also single) tried to seek out egg freezing? Did you just work on your credit score like crazy first and then apply for another loan? How did you approach this? Do you have regrets?** \n\nTopic #2: Choosing single momhood?\n\nThis may be controversial --- **is it wrong to bring a child into a world knowing it won't have a father figure?** I have my brother, he's 22 years old and got a kid! He'd probably a good father figure but I know it's not the same. \n\nWhen I think of getting a sperm donor, it feels a bit wrong to sign up for single momhood because I grew up with my single mom and I always felt a bit resentful about not having a dad in my life. Of course, she tried her best with what she had at the time, but I wouldn't want to do that to my chid as well. To have him or her grow up without that type of family environment seems wrong. Wouldn't bringing a child under \"sperm donor\" circumstances cause the child to have trauma as well? I feel a bit selfish but maybe I'm over thinking it? \n\nIt may be naive of me to think I can find someone in my age bracket and have a family with a mom-and-dad family structure. However, I also find it unfair that I need to force myself to find a man to have a child.  I feel rushed! I guess because also my background is in fertility and I've been on the other side of the situation. I've counseled 20-something-year-old females with diminished ovarian reserve! I've analyzed sperm from 20-something-year-old males and their sperm count is drastically low with little to no 'normal' morphology and motility. I've graded embryo viability after freeze-thaw procedures in the clinic....\n\nI know some women have one-night stands and get pregnant or get pregnant from a bad relationship and still keep the baby. So in a sense, they signed up for single mom-hood as well. But I'm not like that. Not my type of crowd, not my type of lifestyle. I always wanted to have a child out of a loving marriage.  I want to be crazy in love, get married, and *then* have a child. This sounds so incredibly far-fetched but I sorta still believe it could happen. Maybe... \n\nIn my 20s, I always thought I had more time. But it just seems the prospects of me being with someone I'm married to and crazy in love anytime soon seem dismal. Maybe it's my fault, I don't care for dating apps, and I'm not exactly the outgoing social type. \n\nI don't know maybe I'm thinking too much. But I really ***do*** think about it sometimes. \n\nI truly thought I had more time. And with my parents \\*my mom is with someone now\\* getting older and my age in the mirror starting to show itself (e.g. smile lines and the eleven wrinkles between my eyebrows becoming more prominent), I don't want to wait forever. Well, I feel like I'm waiting for something that may never happen. Selfishly, I want a child sooner than later also because I never grew up with grandparents and so I know every day that passes is one less day my kids could be with their grandparents. Plus... if I'm 40 by the time I have my first child, I'll be 50 years old anyway... which means my parents may not even be here on this planet anymore.",

        "text": "This is going to be super long post but I plead to the mods to not delete this post and to subscribers to share your perspective on this issue as everyone close to me including my own mother and siblings have boycotted me and do not want to guide me.\n\nSo I am the eldest of the 3 siblings we are, and we were raised in Dubai. I am 30. A Software Engineer working in an MNC Dubai.\n\nI was brought up in super conservative way, put in a school that's boys only, uni boys only and the authoritative figure was my mother in the family. My dad, we all 3, were super scared of her. Not in a good way, she is extremely narcissistic, extremely bitter and extremely vindictive. She kept us super pampered though. Like won't let us do anything and do everything for us. Kind of the devouring mother Jordan Peterson talk about. All decisions of our lives were made by her, which uni to study in, which car would I get regardless of what I want, she would even reject if a tuition teacher was a female.\n\nLast year, she pestered me a lot to get married, she wished I married a rich cousin sister all her life, btw all our cousins live elsewhere I was brought up with 0 relatives around. Anyway, and I did not like that idea because it was apparent she wanted this for the money. Also we were brought up super humble financially so as I grew older and gained sense of the world around me I knew marrying a woman much high in social status would only cause me issues. So I pushed back that idea and asked her if she could get me arrange married.\n\nShe looked for a girl last year Pakistan based, went to visit them, I spoke to the girl for a 2 months or so and was satisfied. I shared with her everything in advance, how much I earn, what kind of life style I can give her, when we preferably should have kids, and that I will shift closer to my office so me and her can have our own place. All was cool with her and her family. She was a working woman. Age 30 as well. Her family and she claimed her dad had passed away. And that she's sole bread winner of the family so she gets precedent over the other 2 siblings she has 1 elder than her and 1 younger. I could tell she's super pampered by her mother.\n\nShe asks me to come visit her in Pakistan and I do. She meets me once with her mother and wants to get married before I left back to Dubai. She was super pretty. I melted. Imagine a guy who has 0 female experience and a beautiful girl steps forward with proposal. I was on cloud 9. My mom thought her mother was quite stuck up. They both did have a small fight and had sourness against each other. I fought this thought in my mom's head saying it's the girl who I am gonna spend life with not the mother. Plus it's the girl who's pushing now to marry what amazing than that. She just agrees to it but after giving me a toxic tantrum for 2 complete days of how my rich cousin is best choice and she can get me married right away if I wish.\n\nWe tie a knot in 2 weeks time apparently one of my cousins was also getting married at that time so we kind of did not had to think how will relatives show up.\n\nOur first night, few things happened that disturbed me but I brush past it. That night, I was super nervous and it was cold (Late December in Lahore), so I was having hard time getting it up. She is pushing me to penetrate her quickly and said your ejaculation has to go in me in order for me to orgasm (I was like whaaaaat the fuck did she just say) I am so shocked I in confusion and shame just nut all over the sheets. Then she does even more weird thing. She collects the cum in her hand super sneaky way and rushes to the washroom and just inspects it.\n\nI just tell her look, having sex the first night is not like a mandatory thing. Things are new for me and since you are so beautiful I just couldn't get myself relaxed. Now keep this incident in mind and how it would impact me even though my brain just registered it and didn't wanted to think much about it so let's move forward.\n\nI left to Dubai 3 days after my marriage because that's all the annual leaves I could get. I promise her I will at God speed arrange her visa so she can join. I go back to Dubai. My mom and siblings are still in Lahore.\n\nThe day it's her flight to Dubai, my mom gets a message saying your daughter in law has a father and it's a lie that he's dead. My mom calls her and she and her mother doesn't pick up the calls whole day. Keep in mind my mom, siblings are still in Lahore and so is my wife. She apparently would mostly leave our Pakistan house mid day and it was one of the complaints my mom had but I told her since I am not there maybe she's not comfortable or that she wishes to meet her friends and family more now that she's soon gonna leave.\n\nAnyway so the day she's flying she doesn't respond to my mom's calls and boards to flight without visiting my Lahore home.\n\nShe arrives here at airport I already had flowers and lots of prep to receive her I continue with it. Cause I still am that guy who's super excited of this marriage and his wife coming to him. I sing for her and all and receive her and take her to our separate apartment.\n\nNext day before she gets to tell me something my mom calls and so does my uncle and tells me she's a daughter of some big named Pakistani politician and these men often not give their names to their offsprings if it's not a public marriage.\n\nMy mom and uncle have lost it and I am confused, scared and cried a lot. My uncle said till the girl's mom and dad come and talk face to face its not safe for you to stay with her please send her back.\n\nI speak to her and she says I am fine going back. All these people meet there including my wife's father, and my mom being super pissed that these people lied shat a lot on his father. He btw met with my mother along with my wife while my wife's mother never met for this ever with my mom and was also not apologetic.\n\nSo my wife calls me and says your mom said this and that harsh stuff do you guys not understand what a big man this guy is even I was wondering how my dad just took the shit from your mom I said well she's angry and rightly so, you should not have hidden it.\n\nAnyways, things settle down a month later and I send her the flight ticket to come back. She does. While again, my mom and siblings are still in Pakistan.\n\nWe continue to live our lives and hits 1 month mark and I and my mom receive these intimate photos of my wife and an aged man and some videos too of cutting cake together in an anniversary set up and shit. I go blank again. My mom and siblings fly to Dubai within 4 hours time and we all meet and ask my wife about these. She first calls them fake and when I say there's videos too which can't be faked so easily she says you can send me back. He mother is confronted on phone back in Pakistan and she says those are fake and that if we guys have so many issues we should send her back.\n\nNow let's talk about the middle aged men before I move forward. When it was initial days and I hadn't yet traveled to Pakistan to see her and her family, she once said I have an uncle who's my dad's cousin who's in Dubai. He would like to meet you. I agree to meet him it went smooth. It's this man whom those videos and photos were of. And he also not only did distribute the photos to us later after the marriage but would call me and my mom to tell how they both were married etc etc and how we should divorce her. I blocked him after certain point of time. Apparently, one of the things he said that shattered me was... Let's go back to that time when she went back to Pakistan because my uncles and mom asked me to send her back.. Now 1 day before she was to fly back to Dubai. She stayed the whole day at our place with my mom in Lahore. At about 11:30am Pakistan time, I call her to say good night bla bla the lovey dovey stuff an idiot in love like me would say and she seems to be driving while I am on call with her.. I ask her what's up where you at, and she says since I am flying to Dubai tomorrow morning, I asked your mom if I could drive back home and get a couple of clothes and she said sure.. Me, and my wife, we are on a call I am talking all the most cheesy shit and sharing how I am excited she's gonna be back soon and how I would pray that all things resolve and how much I love her.. Now, between this, I hear a car door open, and close real fast. I ask her all okay I heard something.. She's like don't worry it's my scarf that was out continue.. And I keep talking to her for another 30 min. Personal stuff and cute cheesy stuff. Now this man, the aged uncle tells me that the day before she was flying back to you she was with me late night and I was like bullshit. He's like ok, remember you called her midnight, and she opened the car door and closed it.. It was me who entered her car. And you were on speaker the whole time and I heard everything you spoke to her. He re iterated everything I said to my wife word by word and my heart broke and I cried like a toddler and blocked this man. Anyway let's go back to where we where.\n\nBut now my heart is fucked up I can't digest all this but also don't wanna lose her. I kind of take a stand against my mom and tell her no one would question my wife on anything I will speak to her and will decide what would happen. Me and my wife go back to our apartment.\n\nI cry there alot and so does she and I tell her look, I don't know what your past is, and what the truth is, but I don't wanna lose you so I don't want you to go. Do you also want to live with me. She says yes. A day or 2 passes and I see my mom alone and tell her I don't want her to go but I can't lie my heart aches and I am scared. She suggests that you ask her to follow few things till the hearts get clear which is hold on to doing a job immediately. And Let you keep an eye on her phone whom she talks to. I who can't think anything with full clarity as I am still processing what's going on take the advice and I go and ask her these conditions to which she agrees. I said check with your family too if they are OK with it. They say yes. And we continue living.\n\nI here and there keep check on her phone with her consent and I also do get a gist she has enough time to clean things up if any but I just don't focus too much on it and keep moving, I continue to cook for her on weekends, do dishes, take her out. Buy her shoes, clothes. Take her to theme parks. I show her good time.\n\nBut slowly, she starts getting bitter.. I would time to time take her see my siblings and mom and my mom would pass harsh comment once in a while on her and her family for lying and hiding so much.. This would mess her up and when I saw it was getting too much I stopped taking her to my family much..\n\nBut she would complain how she feels she's just in my life too make me a meal and sex.. Btw all this it's just 4 months into our marriage. I would come back home from work tired and just lay down and she would say how lazy I am and how I am just good for eating and resting..\n\nI would come back home tired and sometimes just kiss her and get on sofa to browse phone and she would think my mom had called me earlier or something against her hence why I am not interacting with her.. She would assume, get upset and pass insulting comments. She would even tell me how I suck at satisfying her sexually.\n\nNow I keep tolerating her disrespectful behavior till one day I wake up to see she had forwarded all my mom's whatsapp messages to her phone by using my fingerprint on my phone while I was asleep. And my mom had said nasty shit about her to me but then that between me and my mom. She heard it and got upset and would argue with me while I am pissed why even do this sneaky behavior, just ask me or just focus on how I am disregarding my mom and everyone else and still keeping you happy with me. Why do you bother so much that I might get influenced by someone. If I let go so much shit she brought in my life the last thing is me getting influenced by my mom or someone.\n\nI get mad on this behavior and was kinda tired of all the disrespect I was digesting and message her family that I am sending her back to Pakistan. Now if you have read it till here I thank you but this is just 50% of the story.\n\nNow I book her ticket and take her to airport but her flight on the way gets delayed so I stop by my mom's place and there she asks me to take her to the airport as it's past midnight to which my wife refuses quite aggressively and escapes the house. I get scared and so does my mom and I run behind her and she says I won't go back I have a relative here who would come pick me up.. I said to her no also you and your mom always told us you got no relatives here... Where did this relative some from.. So at this point she's on the streets and people start to notice and my mom suggests I call cops. I call them they arrive. We all go the station. I tell the cop guy this is my legal wife and due to a fight I want her to go back to her parents but she's refusing. He's like well she's an adult, and she says she doesn't wanna live with you guys bla bla so you can do anything please leave the lady alone. It's like 4am now and we leave the police station while she convinces the police her relative would come pick her up.\n\nShe goes to Pakistan after 5 days but on 4th day I leave her a VN crying that I don't know why is my marriage from day 1 giving me nothing but pain but that I will always miss her and I am sorry for hurting you. She tells me don't cry I am flying back right now things are super heated my family is mad too about this police incident so I will after some time tell you how to resolve this because I too wanna live my life with you.\n\nShe flies back. I keep calling her and her mother they don't pick my call up. I keep doing that for 1 straight month with failure and 1 day she picks up and goes bat shit crazy on me. Like how I am poor, my family is poor, how every relative of hers who came to the wedding thought my mother was a witch and how poor these people are. How I am ugly and how she can have whatever kind of man she wishes. I do nothing but cry as I hear this.\n\nShe's like if I want her I should send my relatives to her house to discuss the matter that happened in Dubai like the police thing. Completely disregarding her own behavior. I reach my relatives and they tell me wtf you heard all that did so much for her and yet you want to. Pursue her? Are you even real. They refuse to go mend things with her and she is hell bent that my relatives visit her home. Btw her mother and she herself, never from their hearts all this time were apologetic about them hiding about the father thing or any remorse or any explanation on the uncle thing. Wife would say be a man no one talks about past. Allah says don't share your past with your husband and she would share these Islamic videos to gas light me. And her mother would say in future when you visit Pakistan we will then talk about all this now just live happily and don't think too much.\n\n4 months pass by and she sends me a divorce filed and tells me how it's good for both of us hence she divorced me. I then go bat shit crazy on myself and cry to sleep almost every night. I am no more in contact with her this period as she blocked me.\n\n2 more months pass, I get out of this pain slowly by looking after myself. And I become stable 2 more months later, I have forgotten all the shit I went through all the pain. Donated all her clothes she left behind, all the things we bought together for our apartment.. I have no memory of hers left. I heal.\n\nJust 4 weeks later from today. It's the 3rd hearing now for her divorce, she messages me for reconciliation and how her mother and father says to her she should not be in depression. When she connected back with me, All memories come back to me I cry and apologize to her and leave her mom a vn for the police incident even though it wasn't meant in bad light I was just scared where's she running. Anyway I profusely apologize to her and her mother and her mother still doesn't wanna talk to me. Her mom just 2 weeks back in an breif call said I never wanted this marriage my daughter forced me so I agreed. Why did you fuck my girls life lol they are the one who initiated the divorce and I am the one who fucked up. All this time I was crying pleading to come on resolution and all they did was keep me blocked and never talked to me.\n\nAccording to my wife, she says let's move on with our lives and that this distance had cleared her heart and all and it will be nice life she's gonna help me grow etc etc. But my mother says your wife and her mother can't choose to divorce you on a whim and then just reconcile without properly communicating with me and you. And I personally also don't like this idea let alone my mom. I think it's wrong. My wife says she will change, be respectful, be more accountable.. And tells me I should not involve anyone in our matters. While her mother will once we get back to keep a check on me so that a similar incident doesn't happen again lol.\n\nNow my issue is, I went through so much pain and. Got out of it just recently been 2 months. My heart and mind says she's not. Good for me nor is her family but then I randomly miss her now that we are back in touch she would share photos we had together, places we visited, songs we heard and it pulls me. Back into this vortex. My mom says this is totally wrong and that if I brought her back. I am on my own from then on and she would never accept this girl for her fucked up behavior.",

        "text": "Alright, my apologies if this rub some the wrong way.\n\nI'm an active person and I genuinely enjoy being active. That said, having a \"fit\" shape is collateral benefit from living (dare I say it) athletic lifestyles (I run long distance and do CrossFit). However, a friend asked me if I would like to go out on a date with one of her friends and I declined as I don't find him attractive. \n\nSaid friend was offended and aggressively asked if it's because her friend is on the \"bigger\" side. She said \"imagine if a man rejected you because your size\", which to be honest has happened to me before lmao. Men have preferences too, I have been told by a guy friend he's not attracted to toned muscular women like me and I accepted it. \n\nApparently, I'm missing out on a sweet man who would give everything to the right girl. So I told her, perhaps I won't be the right girl, I would do him out of sympathy and that's recipe for disaster in dating and would she or he wants that? \n\nI prefer partner with same values as me. For as long as I remember knowing him, he complains about something as little as a 10 mins walk. And tbh, i see that as a red flag when men just doesnt want to put in effort in little things. It's equivalent to lacking in discipline for me.\n\nOne time we went hiking and he stopped short of the 300m to the peak and just refused to continue.

        "text": "Ok, this is a fucking weird one so bear with me. \n\nWe all saw that meme floating around a few weeks ago about how 30-50% of the population doesnt have internal dialogue. This baffled me and I thought surely the numbers must be skewed. I found the original study and if Im being honest, it doesn't hold up that well. However, I have since dove deeper and found many more studies and experiments and it actually seems like 75% of the population... doesn't think. One participant explained how theres this like visual mess floating around in her brain when she wakes up thats like shower and coffee and pack lunch but the most pressing thing gets an explication point in like a thought bubble directing her to that thing. What. The. Fuck. All of a sudden my life makes sense. Those idiots in the far right lane slamming through 4 lanes of traffic for a left turn... they can't think. Like all the ridiculous shit people do... I get it now. \n\nSo simulation theory took hold about 2 decades ago and as we develop in scientific research we are finding more and more evidence we are in a simulation. I mean.... so what? Whether advanced aliens or god (these are the same in my mind, I believe in goddess but who am I to say what form she takes?) or whatever you want to think it is, evidence is mounting that we've been created. Fine. \n\nBut then I learn about 75% of people not thinking and I start just calling them \"NPCs\" in my mind. There are NPCs EVERYWHERE! I had to return something at a box store recently. She literally had me calling my partner for the number on his debit card while I explained to her that this isnt relevant. A manager came by and sorted it all out but it was weird. I then went to buy nail clippers and the woman did not make eye contact, did not look at me, just scanned, shoved the payment thing at me and let me leave. For a while I wondered if she was deaf but she spoke to a coworker so thats out. Theres a small grocery store by my work so I have the same teller every other week or so. The conversation always goes like this, her: nice larmiar pendant!! me: thanks, it took months to track something like this down. Her: I bet, look at my larimar ring!!!  ... every...other...week. Like for 3 weeks sure but for a year?? And as a larimar enthusiast you would remember my piece... it wasnt cheap.  \n\nIt came to a head for me tonight when there was another question on this sub and someone literally said \"Id prefer no deep conversation, I just want something normal\" and I was like, \"fuck... they can be identified on the internet as well!!!\"\n\nI spoke to my mom and uncle and all my favourite people about this and the general consensus is that while the theory seems solid it might affect compassion which is never a good thing. To me it increases compassion. Forever I was like \"why are we all breeding and killing the earth? Why are we consuming excessively? Why aren't we kind to one another when it costs nothing?!\" but if 75% of the population has a preprogrammed response then theyre just doing whatever they can do and nothing more. All of a sudden Im FILLED with compassion. \n\nIm just more seeking.... do you feel like you live in a world of non human entities? Do you feel the ocean on your skin and smell the soil in rain and love so much it hurts and listen to music in a way that makes you cry and make love to your partner when you believe no other has ever loved this deeply before or... is your life just.... meh. Whats your take on the general public?",

        "text": "tl;dr-- lifelong CF-leaning, now with unplanned pregnancy (12 wks) and still on fence re: termination vs carrying to term. \n\n I apologize in advance about the length of the post, but would greatly appreciate any advice, anecdotes, words of wisdom.\n\n40F and have been single the majority of my adult life, but content and happy. Always identified as child-free, have never had a maternal instinct or that innate urge to have kids. Multiple reasons for this: \n\n1) did not have a happy, functional family structure modeled to me growing up. Nothing abusive or crazy toxic, just that my parents obviously never loved each other and parents were not the most nurturing or loving towards us kids.\n\n2) Similar to many millennials and Gen Z, I have Climate Anxiety. I feel the world is overpopulated and we are terrible stewards for the earth. I don't want to contribute to this crisis.\n\n3) I'm an introvert and love my solitude and quiet. I have hobbies I love and feel like I don't have enough time to pursue as it is (sewing, cello, ballet). My goal is 1-2 international trips a year-- there are so many countries, cultures, natural wonders that I would love to explore. My ideal living situation with a partner is LAT (living apart together). \n\n4) I have at times considered if I would ever have a kid/kids, but in my mind it was under very specific conditions. I'd never consider undertaking parenthood as a single person and would never consider IVF or fertility treatments (not that I'm against it, I just don't desire motherhood enough to pursue it.) I would have to be in a stable partnership, with someone who I felt would make a great partner and dad.\n\n5) Now being 40 (will be 41 at time of delivery), I have concerns about being an older parent. Not having the energy to parent. Delayed retirement and deferred dreams/goals to raise a child. \n\nMy current situation: I've been in a FWB+ situation with my partner (49M) on-off since the beginning of pandemic. Over the past 6 months his feelings have changed and he wants to be all in and pursue a serious, committed LTR. I'm the commitment-phobe in this situation. But we've continued to see each other while our relationship status is nebulous and in limbo. I realized I was pregnant at ~ 8 weeks (I was traveling and on birth control pills to suppress my period while abroad and then came down with Covid, which caused extreme fatigue). The same day I took my positive at home pregnancy test, I also had some light spotting which I hoped beyond hope was a miscarriage and that this was only a chemical pregnancy. My period never came. \n\nThe hard part: Even though I've always identified as CF and love my current lifestyle, am pro-choice, and live in a state where abortion is accessible... I did not immediately jump on terminating the pregnancy. I've agonized over the decision, have read the Baby Decision, talked to family and friends (all supportive of my choice, either way), talked to my therapist and my partner (he has always felt he was destined to parent another child-- he has a 13 year old son, but supports my decision, either way). So the kicker is that I went to my OB to get an US to confirm my gestational age (12 weeks), and seeing the images of the fetus and hearing the heartbeat was surreal. It's almost like I can't bring myself to actively terminate the fetus, yet if I were to have a miscarriage I would feel immense relief (does that make sense?). At my OB visit, I was offered genetic testing and am waiting on those results (100% if there were chromosomal abnormalities I would abort and feel that would be the most compassionate thing to do for the fetus and myself). Anyway, I realize I can't sit on the fence much longer-- I need to terminate ASAP or commit to carrying to term and becoming a parent (with support from family, friends, and partner).\n\nHas anyone been in this situation or can relate? Thanks in advance!",

It's like my default state is to be on high alert for danger and my brain cannot accept that good things have happened. I'm trying to explain this as best as I can, so I hope it makes sense. But it makes me very sad. I'll even try to look at photos I took of happy moments in my life, but it's like my brain doesn't accept them. \n\nI deal with anxiety disorder and had a very difficult five years of trauma and I have been to counseling a few different times. I listen to several podcasts and read plenty of books. I'm currently dealing with insomnia and anxiety flaring up. I feel like I'm working so hard to figure this out, but I'm coming up blank. I am considering going back to counseling for sure. My doctor has also mentioned Zoloft, and I am open to it, but I would consider it a last resort because I don't want to rely on a medication, just due to the fact that my sister has had addiction issues. \n\nI'm just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone and what they did to get out of that rut? How do you accept and remember happy memories again?",

She has family down in florida, and her new boyfriend also lives in florida, about 3 hours away from her parents. She said she wanted to go down there to be with family, and also live with him (half of the time as she claims). She is taking a breather, centering herself, and thinking about her next steps in life and career. \n\nI'm supportive of her taking some time off and spending it with family. She has always been much more introverted than me, and thus scared to try new things in life. Therefore, she has always kind of taken the easy route (ie boyfriend who can split or take care of the bills, waiting too long to quit her dead end job for fear of the unknown). These are all thing I can relate to in some sense.\n\nWhen I was her age I was at a very similar crossroads. I quite my dead end unfulfilling job, and pursued a career that I had no experience in and became successful and fully independent, just buying my own home last year. As her best friend of 15+ years, I am occasionally giving her some tough love in the sense of telling her she should aim for more in life than to settle down at 30 in a city she doesn't love. She, unlike me because I don't want children, feels the biological clock ticking as she does want to have kids. \n\nI pretty much just tell her to create her own life and independence first before truly settling down into a life that's essentially being handed to her. This would mean long-distance with her bf, which they did for about a year and travelled frequently to one another.\n\nAITA for pushing her to want more? She replies with she is taking things one day at a time with what makes her happy. I just feel that if she settles down at 30 without pursuing some things for herself first, she'll have regrets.",

My opinion is that this has brought out some people pleasing tendencies. She has started hanging out with a person in the past that treated me horribly because she wanted to date my then boyfriend now husband. We never ‚Äúmade up‚Äù but she is bringing up this person who she knows treated me badly (think mean girl high school stuff). \n\nShe has also started hanging out with another woman with the same type of ‚Äúmean girl‚Äù thing.

I don‚Äôt think I have done anything to offend this person, but she obviously doesn‚Äôt want me around. \n\nHowever, A always wants to talk about the things they do, invite her to our hangouts, and I have tried being pleasant, but I am really over this.

I will gladly do that for every decades anniversary but being a group of friends, it's not possible to keep it up like that several times a year. \n\nShe was pissed but said ok. \n\nI thought this was my issue until something happened and It was clear to me.\n\nShe has a brother M who's best friend A is very close to their family. A sometimes goes on vacation with M, C and their parents...ECT \n\nA has organized a party in his new apartment he is sharing with his girlfriend. \n\nC asked her brother to give her the address so she could come (note, she wasn't invited, she didn't ask if she could come. She ask for the address to come). To make it short, her brother said 3/4 times he didn't want her to come. She was maaaad telling how uncool it was, getting nervous on her phone texting him and insulting him.\n\nSo, she decided to call A and ask him for his address so she could come. Of course, A gave her the address. She came alone, didn't know anyone and stayed. \n\nNow, A's girlfriend told M his sister was inviting herself and it seems like this is the 2nd time she is doing it. \n\nM repeated that to C.\n\nStill, C stated the girlfriend was a bitch and SHE was the issue! \n\nTo the point her brother, to be heard started yelling (she told us the story).\n\nOur common friend and I also tried to explained a few days ago her behavior is not acceptable. A 45 min discussion when she said she doesn't feel like she is pushing things. \n\nC just said she doesnt see the issue and it's her brother (read, she can come into his plan and that's normal and no one should say anything).\n\nBack to my story, I just realized, as much as I love my friend, she forces people to go out or invites herself and simply PRESSURE people. \n\nA few years ago, someone already made the comment directly to her and to stop that. \n\nI\n\nThe issue with that friend is :\n\n- she wants content for her social media, she doesn't say it but I can tell and is always looking to expose her crazy life so always need to do something that will look cool\n\n- she wants kids and with the job we have, it's almost impossible to keep up a normal life so she wants to enjoy while she can. I don't want kids so I will enjoy until my body can't. So, we don't have the same sense of emergency\n\n- she only has 2 friends. One is leaving in another country and I. I never asked why she didn't have childhood friends ...no one. I think she had a boyfriend at the age of 16 and spent her whole time with him and his family and when she broke up in her 20s, she had no one. \n\nI am writing right now cause I said I wasn't going out cause I have many things to handle. She answered \"what about Thursday? What about Wednesday? \". My no was CRYSTAL CLEAR. \n\nShe is Lovely, fun, nice, generous...VERY sensible.\n\nHow to act with her?\n\nThanks",

I have been in therapy for several years, as has my partner. We both had difficult childhoods, my parents were emotionally and medically abusive and we are now estranged. My husband and I attended couples therapy for a while but COVID happened and that stopped. He doesn't want to go back to couples therapy. \n\nI recently started reading the book \"Already Enough\" by Lisa Olivera and so many things from therapy are suddenly clicking into place. I think the terminology used in the book just makes more sense to my brain. For instance, what I've heard referred to as \"patterns\" in therapy are referred to as \"stories\" in the book, etc. The language just resonates in a way that illuminates concepts that have felt a little murky until now. Now I feel like there are many things dawning on me all at once. Things two truly wonderful therapists have tried to help me with over the last 6 years. It's all just clicking. And the most concerning revelation is that my needs are not being met in my relationship, and I've stayed because that is what feels familiar/comfortable, but it is toxic and unhealthy. It is hard to admit. But now I can't un-know it. My husband has repeatedly told me he is not going to change and he is happy with the way he is, the way our relationship is. Sometimes he feels bad that he \"can't be what I need\" and he feels like I deserve more. He has no desire to meet my needs romantically or emotionally. I would say we have a really good relationship otherwise, but it is very one-sided. I do lots of work to make him happy and our household happy, and he does not reciprocate. There are other issues in my work life and personal life that are coming into focus too, but this stuff around my marriage is the most frightening.\n\nI've been in denial for so long, thinking first that things would change if I worked hard enough or changed myself, then I moved into feeling like this is just the way things are going to be for me, it's what I'm \"built for\". I'm afraid that I won't be able to sit on this truth for very long pretending everything is \"normal\". Like I've uncovered something I can't cover again. I'm afraid to bring this up to my husband because it might end our marriage. In fact, I'm kind of sure it will. Which terrifies me. I don't want to blow up our carefully made life - we've both invested so much into it and it's really not a bad life. Do I wait until our kid is done with high school in a year and half?

If I were an empty nester in my 50s or so?\n\n####I'd love hear from other women who followed a similar timeline to mine and how they managed their empty nester feelings.\n\nThanks ahead time.\n\nMoms rock!",

I answered \"My husband, because he's my best friend.\"\n\nThe responses varied from surprise, to outright teasing. Someone said \"I think you're lying: no-one likes their other half that much\". And then the others started agreeing with each other that getting stuck on an island with your spouse would be awful.\n\nI've known my husband since 2012. He was my friend for years before we dated, and even after being married since 2019 I thoroughly enjoy spending time with him. I love experiencing new things with him, and I consider him a friend first, husband second. We'll be welcoming our first son in May, and both of us are stronger than ever before.\n\nIs that.... bad? Am I wrong for genuinely enjoying the company of someone I've chosen to spend the rest of my life with? Did I miss a memo? What's the deal?",
