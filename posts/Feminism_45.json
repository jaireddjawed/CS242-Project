A place where I feel constantly attacked and where I feel obligated to stop and fight this oppression, because otherwise who will?\n\nIt seems I'm doing this alone.\n\nI'm often in parties where other women are just putting up with it in silence, or spouting that internalised misogyny of 'boys will be boys', 'there's no harm in it', 'I just let them get on with it.'.\n\nIt's depressing, it's exhausting and I know it's not doing a damn bit of good either way, but my sense of integrity, of personage means that I just refuse to roll over and let them get away with it.\n\nSo my question, if I've not already answered it myself, is how do I carry on?

That make me  realise how bad consent is understand by most people and why it need to be teach.\n\nAlso sorry for the bad grammar, english is not my first language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had just broke up with my boyfriend at the time. I was pretty sad and I was out very often because I didn't want to think about it.\n\nI had make some new friends who invited me to a party. I agreed because again I was trying to keep myself entertain.\n\nThere was a guy, let's call him Steve. I barely knew him, but it wasn't the first time I saw him. I thought he was cute and funny. I might even have a crush on it, I can't tell anymore.\n\nThey were plenty of drink and I got drunk, everybody was drunk.\n\nThe party goes on and it was getting late.\n\nSo one by one, everyone was getting to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteve propose me to sleep with him in his bed (the party was at his apartment). I didn't say no because I didn't want to sleep on the floor and to be honest, I liked Steve. I didn't intend to have sex at all. I wanted to sleep.\n\nSo we went into his bed and the last think I remember was him on me. Then I blacked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the record, I don't have psychologic trauma about that event. I just consider it a dick move. \n\nHe didn't hurt me physically and afterwards, he said that he was also drunk and wasn't thinking clearly.\n\nIt took me a long time to realise it was rape because I was attracted by him and I was sure I would have sleep with him anyway. \n\nI know it's wrong. I know I sound stupid with that story but I think it's important. Because all rape stories are not black. I'm sure there is a lot of victims like me. Those whom the body were taken without their consent but didn't think at this like a rape because they know their rapist and didn't want to cause any trouble. Because, you know, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI'm a feminism. I'm not ashamed I was raped, but I'm ashamed of how long it took me to realise it. How easy for me it was to think it was a misunderstanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "I want to address this point because it’s one that I see over and over again as a rebuttal to our aggressive discontent regarding sexual assault:\n\n“but what about \\[enter politician or celebrity name here\\]? He sexually assaulted/harassed/ disrespected women, and HE was still elected/served in a position of power.”\n\nYES, Clarence Thomas was confirmed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice in 1991 despite allegations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill. YES, Bill Clinton grossly abused his position of power and was accused of sexual assault/harassment. As much as nostalgia may beckon some of us to think of the 90s as “the good old days,” these instances should NOT be used to suggest that ANY perpetrator of sexual violence should be forgiven (or, god-forbid, selected to serve on the highest court in the land), or the issue swept under the rug, just because other abusers have incurred little to no repercussions in the past.\n\nThe times, they are a-changin’. Over the last 3 decades, America’s pervasive rape culture has grown, shifted, and FINALLY come under fire. The assaults that used to, disgustingly, be chalked up to “boys will be boys” will no longer stand without question.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. We shouldn’t want to continue on with the way it’s always been if the way it’s always been has led to our culture’s current approach to rape and sexual assault. We should want to DO better. BE better. Raise better humans. We may have failed survivors in the past, but I’m certain that America is capable of learning from its mistakes. I’m certain that no one I know thinks we should continue holding sexual assault victims accountable in ANY way for the abuse enacted on them.\n\nYes, the all-encompassing “She” is someone’s Wife, Daughter, Sister, Mother. More simply, and more importantly, “She” is someone.",
