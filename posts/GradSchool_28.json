I have an interest in research, especially sociological, in general.\n\nI am going to graduate with a BS in nursing this spring. I am going to take two gap years before hopefully going to medical school. I would like to participate in academic research, especially sociological and medical, during those two gap years. Do you know of any pathways for me to do so? Thank you.\"\n\nThe responses that I got were very unfriendly and not helpful at all and I got a bunch of downvotes. Yeah I am brash but what can I say, you're a bitch if you are a professor or PhD student and you call students annoying and don't even help me at all! Is this what academia culture is like? Unwelcoming and unsupportive to newcomers? Trying to decide if it is worth me joining and trying or not, because I have already had many struggles just writing an undergraduate research thesis for my university Honors program. I am trying to not let one bad experience define my outlook and ruin my long-standing passion and interest in research, but if it is full of such judgmental snooty people I am not even gonna try joining",

I applied for it last year and was accepted, but did not attend because my very short notice of admission would not let me get a visa in time. \n\nFrankly, my primary reason for doing this program is because I enjoy school more than anything else. I find studying to be the most fulfilling thing, and despite many warnings against it online, I think I should try to start my career into research/academic fields. The masters program is interdisciplinary, but my focus would be in the niche of ecological economics. The university houses one of the leading research centers in this small field, and I am really invested in the work they do.\n\nIn addition to the academic experience, I'm itching to leave the US, travel, and experience life elsewhere. The program is inexpensive, and my family will lend me the cost of tuition if needed. I have the additional privilege of being debt free, and I have some money saved that will allow me to live comfortably and travel. \n\nThe other day, a stranger asked me what I plan to use that degree for, and I admitted that I'm not sure yet. Is that okay? Is my hazy path going to backfire? reddit tends to be good at harsh truths",

I'm used to going to class and doing homework with a set deadline, and I'm afraid that the unstructed nature of thesis hours is going to result in a decline in productivity.\n\nHow did you/do you organize your time when taking thesis hours? What doesa normal day look like? What would you do differently if you could start again? How did you balance the time spent doing research and the time spent writing? Are there any tools that were especially helpful?\n\nAny advice would be awesome. I know that it's normal to feel like you don't know what you're doing during a post-graduate degree, but this is still making me anxious.",

What do I do? Wait for a couple of months till the paper result comes out before resuming working seems unreasonable though not impossible.

I'm leaning toward the second bachelor's since my first degree is in an unrelated field, and I'm also worried I wouldn't be able to get into grad school after failing out of law school. Would a second bachelor's degree improve my chances of eventually getting accepted to a master's program someday?

I get a lot of freedom in picking my own topic and books. One book I've just started reading is Ichiro Hori's \"Folk Religion in Japan.\" This is the second book I am reading, in addition to this being a strong personal interest of mine, so I am already coming into this study with a good amount of context.  \n\n\nThe information in the book is amazing so far, and has helped me fill in some gaps - and I do feel that I am benefitting from reading it. However, one thing keeps pulling me out of the narrative of the book - making me stop reading and make furious little side comments in the margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis book is from the mid-20th century and it is rife with theoretical assumptions that are just completely outdated - based on everything I've learned in my anthropology and religious studies theories classes. The author will frequently describe Folk Religions (the focus of the book) as \"having meaning, despite their vulgarity\" (paraphrase) and will make reference to \"high religions.\" It reeks of E.B. Tylor / J.G. Frazer's assumptions of \"primitive/animistic/nature religions\" as being less-evolved, less-complex, and perhaps less-worthy of one's full attention as a result. All the theory I have learned has distinctly described this categorization as an outdated paradigm - in addition to it rubbing me personally the wrong way. Yet, the information is still good in many ways and I do plan to continue reading this for now, especially since it is not overly long.  \n\n\nI am wondering if other (current or former) students have had experience with reading \"old\" or \"outdated\" texts that make use of theories that have been rigorously \"disproven\" or have at least \"thoroughly fallen out of favor.\" If anyone could share insight or experience related to how I can get the most out of this book while being sure to keep my eyes open and not get trapped in other outdated-assumptions that I may miss on my initial reading here.  \n\n\nMuch love,",

That being said, have you picked up a second job on campus while getting a stipend and how do you explain it to the higher ups of your program that you had to do it to stay financially healthy.",

Unfortunately, most programs require a BA and the equivalent is taking as many courses as you'd have to take in a second degree. At my school you can re-enroll as a second degree student and it may take 2 years instead of 4 for the second degree. Has anybody done something similar to this? I would've gone straight for a master's if I could've but I realize I just don't have the coursework and experience most MA programs require. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am currently applying to PsyD programs in my Province (I live in Canada). The application process for PsyD programs where I live is a bit different, in that you must find a supervisor **before even being elligible to apply to the program.** However, finding a supervisor does not guarantee your admission. It simply makes you eligible to apply.\n\nI have applied to many traditional PhD programs so far (Dec 1st deadlines) and am currently working on a couple of PsyD apps which are due in 3 weeks. There is one prof in particular who accepted to back my application for a PsyD. However, I am having major, *major* second thoughts about going to that school, let alone applying. \n\nI won't get into the specifics, but I 100000% know that the school is just not for me. I'm wondering if I should simply tell the prof ASAP that I'm withdrawing the application, or just go ahead with it not to look bad… But going ahead with it will require so much time+energy (new personalized PS and research proposal) and will be costly. \n\nIs there a super polite way to withdraw from this process? I feel super guilty because I feel like my spot could’ve been given to another applicant and that I’ve wasted someone's spot. I also don’t want to anger anyone… \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? Any insight appreciated !",

What if it coincided with a really *important day*, like a test or deadline?\n\n3) Did you find that your professors, PIs, and doctors were willing to work with you? (even though my doctor went through med school, she has been the least sympathetic 😕. She did eventually apologize for that, though, so i’m hoping it improves)\n\n4) Were you able to make friends, even with your condition? Did people ask questions? I have to carry this big and heavy medical device in my backpack and I’m still not sure how that’s going to work realistically. I’m considering a rolling briefcase at this point. I also have to use it during class sometimes. So I’ll be very conspicuously dragging out a big bag during the middle of class. \n\n\n\n*Wall of text background on me if you’re curious. Can be skipped. I’m more interested in your experience!*\n\nI took a one year leave of absence. I don’t believe I get any more time than that. During my time off, I tried really hard to improve my situation. I switched meds (made it worse), lost 50 pounds (no change), had surgery (after a second opinion I found out my doctor had botched it and cut through some surrounding nerves… so that made it way way way worse), and tried really hard to stay consistent with yoga and CBT aspects of pain management. \n\nBut the fact of the matter is… I’m actually in worse shape than when I started. I can’t exactly sit right now. Not in a regular chair. Not until my nerves regenerate (if they regenerate, when they regenerate). I will be standing through my classes. \n\nI decided to drop my TA position because I’m not sure I will be able to last the full four hours per day without leaving the lab and lying down in a fetal position in the hallway. Without the job, I can attend grad school part time and reconcile my incompletes from when I left. Plus I don’t have other options for work yet anyway. I won’t be assigned a research position until my faculty advisor thinks I’m ready for it. I’m a non-traditional student, and I was accepted into my grad program even though I don’t have all the required undergrad credits. Once I have the undergrad credits, I can join a lab.\n\nSo I’m paying full price for grad school. It sucks, because before they were paying me and the stipend was nice and the healthcare was actually fantastic. I also loved my job as a TA. It was in my old field, and it was the only time I remembered I was actually a competent and intelligent person (like oh yeah! I do know advanced scientific concepts! Just not quite there in engineering yet). \n\nI’m working on getting my 504 changed. However, I won’t have accommodations until the second week of school most likely.  I don’t know what they’ll be. Unfortunately chaise lounge chairs in each class likely isn’t an option. \n\nI’m not too worried about my grad classes. Graduate professors have been understanding in the past. Undergrad profs are overworked and really don’t care about your shit unless they are legally required to though lol.\n\nAnyway. I’m just nervous. And I hate that I’m returning more visibly disabled. All I can think of are ways to hide it, but at this point I don’t think I can 😕. I hate standing out and worry it will affect how my professors and peers treat me.",

I want to share this story with any international students who come here for advice. \n\nIt's a no-brainer to not accept any offer without clear understanding of how that school manages stipend or scholarship, if they give anything at all. But for international students, this is a lot more important for immigration status issue - they need to prove that they have funding to cover at least 1 year of *cost of attendance* , not just tuition and tuition fee. If they get funding from the school, good, but always make sure that the professor is allowed to give you the funding from the source from which the money comes. \n\nWhen I was applying for MS in food science, I applied to several schools, one of which had a fairly well known professor in nutraceutical research. She was very amicable and wanted to have me in her lab, though she said she couldn't cover all the tuition. She instead offered me a position that will take care of at least 50% of tuition by working as a TA or RA. The school also was in a larger state than where I lived at that moment and I was getting too antsy, so I accepted the offer and turned down other schools. \n\nTwo weeks later, the professor called me while I was eating lunch and apologized to me that she *forgot* (how?? I made it very clear) that I was an international student, and because of that she couldn't pay me from the funding source. The funding source turned out to be from USDA, and she couldn't use it to pay foreign students.  This set off 239 million red alarms - because I would graduate my BSc in fall, and was not allowed by laws to take an entire semester off for fall admission again, or I would effectively be an illegal alien. I also had no money to cover the cost beyond the would-be remaining bill which I had planned to pay by prostrating to my relatives to lend me money. It stung extra because the professor was very business like and curt during this phone call, which led me to turn down the admission ultimately. \n\nI had to call around the schools that I had turned down to readmit me, and by pure generosity, one professor from another school decided to take me in under his wing. It led to a better stipend actually, so I did not have to worry about immigration issues and borrowing money from my relatives. This all happened in a span of three weeks, and the word \"embarrassment\" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt when I had to beg them to readmit me. \n\nso folks, let this be a lesson. Always make sure that the source from which the money comes allows to be paid to noncitizens or more specifically, foreign students.",

Also, does your university's graduate school have well-funded programs in place to offset these expenses if adequate money isn't available through other avenues?",

        "text": "Currently located in Canada, completing first year (Engineering). I'm fixated on my goal of attending a top US school for an MSc and eventually a PhD in Civil/Enviro Eng and had a few questions. Does co-authoring papers (published in journals) make for a competitive applicant? \n\nI'm currently on the track to co-author (2nd or 3rd) about 2-4 papers this year. I'm an active member and involved in projects in the largest research group in my faculty, they're fairly well known and secure a lot of funding. I'm planning to do research rather than work in the industry for my co-op, but would industry internships be an asset too?\n\nIn addition, do schools in the US look at individual semesters, or just cumulative GPA? I am projecting between 3.8-3.85 (assuming 1 poor semester), but already worried that that might not cut admissions to schools like MIT/Stanford. \n\nI know these questions are all quite early but I figured there's no harm in asking around early! Thank you for your input in advance.",

I was handed the letter by the honor committee and they specifically told me it could help me for grad school. It's an awesome letter with multi-page recommendations from people from many different parts of my campus.\n\nHere's my issue: what am I meant to do with this letter? My online grad school application does not have a section for uploading documents other than my resume, so I can't just scan it and upload it.\n\nBeing the original document (they also gave me a copy), do I mail it to the admissions committee? Do I include a note stating, hey, this is proof that I got an awesome award? Do I ship it in the original envelop with my university's name and logo?\n\nI agree that this letter could boost my application, but I have no idea how to make sure its read by the application committee.

        "text": "I (25F) have always planned to pursue a PhD in psychology/education. I majored in psychology in undergrad (graduated 2020) and have been involved in some research in psychology and did a senior thesis as well. I had a decent GPA, not great, of 3.6. \n\nAfter graduating, I wanted to gain more research experience before applying to grad school, but I really struggled with job search right after graduation, especially with the pandemic. For a year I did not have a job, though I spent so much of time applying and interviewing for labs. And the gap in my resume really didn’t help as they asked what research experience I have gained after school, but I was just trying to pay rent and make a living doing freelance graphic design work and working in retail. \n\nLuckily, I currently have a research job, but at a research company as opposed to a university lab. What I do is more research consulting and qualitative research with pharmaceuticals, so it’s quite far from the work I would like to do, which are in the topics of cognition and education. I’ve consistently been applying to RA jobs that are more aligned with my academic interests, but I have not been successful.\n\nWhat really broke me recently was that I actually was offered a full-time RA job at a lab I’ve been dreaming of working in, but a week after I accepted the offer, they rescinded it saying they gave it to someone else instead. They said I could still work part time with them so that I could at least get the experience, but when I said I was interested, they completely ghosted me. After multiple follow up emails, they have been completely silent. This really disappointed and hurt my feelings because I finally felt like I was moving in the right direction, and I just can’t help but feel that I just wasn’t good enough for them and I am not wanted. \n\nI really wanted to apply to grad school this year, but at this rate I am afraid I won’t have any chances. It’s kind of like chicken-and-egg, to study the topics I am interested I need experience in them, but it’s hard to even get the experience bc labs want people who already have experience… I have been emailing PIs and lab managers for volunteer opportunities but they either (1) don’t respond, or (2) say they give preference to current students and hesitant to bring in someone who’s not affiliated at all. I don’t know how else I am supposed to find relevant experience.\n\nI have done multiple workshopping of my CV and cover letters with some PhD students and post docs, so I’m hoping to keep improving my skills. However I feel so anxious and stressed thinking about how I am maybe just not good enough to pursue a PhD bc I’m not skilled/smart enough. It really hurts to see my dreams of pursuing a PhD get further and further away.\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences in your academic careers, and any tips/advice on how to gain the right experiences to become a strong candidate for grad school. I know most people say “find opportunities to work hands on in a research lab,” but I am stumped on how to do so if labs are so difficult to get into.",

        "text": "I’m currently a second year undergraduate student studying CS, Linguistics, and Math, and I really want to pursue a PhD after undergrad. Right now I’m interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning but i’m also really interested in formal language theory and computational linguistics. I’m also currently doing research assistance in both fields. \n\nIve looked at programs like UW’s Comp Ling program but I feel like there’s not enough machine learning and computer science. But ive looked at cs phd programs and they don’t really have anything of formal language theory. Would anyone have any advice on how to look for programs? So far, i’ve really only found 1 faculty at Johns Hopkins that really matches my research interests . I was also looking into cognitive science PhDs because they seem to integrate a lot of the things i’m interested in. \n\nAny advice would be great, thank you!",

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nCurrently a masters student who is in the second semester of the degree and finding out that bench research might not be their cup of tea. This dread of doing bench research is keeping me very unproductive in the lab despite me trying to suck it up and get experiments done so I haven't progressed much in the first semester of my program. I found out that instead of doing bench research and defending a thesis, I could do a review paper instead which aligns more with my interests and working style but I am afraid to approach my PI with the idea as I don't want to seem like a quitter. I've sucked it up and had projects etc completed in the past despite being uninterested in them but I don't know why it's just so hard for me to drag myself to the lab everyday. \n\nShould I just suck it up and continue on with my bench research or do you guys think it's worth bringing this up to my PI and advisors?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I don't want to take the risk of getting it from them if they have never written one. Would it be okay if I get it from my former internship manager? I have done a 4 months coop 2 years. And with my current manager, I have worked with him for 1.8 years but he has never written an LOR.",
