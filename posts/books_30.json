Morgensterns) \"The Princess Bride.\" I'm referring to how many of the autobiographical elements were true or not. Did he have pneumonia as a child? Did he have a wife and kid at the time? What things did he use to further the myths and make them believable that may have been false or completely made up.",

But finding that Portuguese is closer to French than it is to English, I started to consider reading one of the French editions (In case the similarity between languages has an effect on the interpretation of the text).\n\nKnowing the following facts, which language and edition would you recommend ?\n\n* I am comfortable reading in both English and French (none of which is my native language) \n* I can neither speak nor read Portuguese (Spanish is not an option either)\n* I prefer reading books in their native languages as written by the authors. If I don't speak the language, I look for the most praised / closest translations.\n* The Book of Disquiet seems to be a hell of a mess and I want to have the best experience reading it.\n\nIf anyone has been through a similar situation, I'd love to hear about it and see how you resolved it.

A lover of books about knighthood, Don Quixote sets out to live his life as a knight and adventure into the perlious world of challenges (or so he imagines in his fanatic imagination).\n\nIt's a funny read, and I was enjoying it until u got finished with 16% of the novel (that's 150 pages). It's pretty episodic in what happens every chapter; Don Quixote sees something and mistakes it for a thing he read about in his books about knights and either gets in trouble or rewarded (usually the former). It's entertaining but when you have 800 pages left to go and this seems to be the formula it can get boring.\n\nThe solution: read one chapter a day, treat it like a 5 minute program. That's what I'm doing, it's gonna take awhile to finish but it won't stop me from reading other books at the same time",

I understand (at least I think I do) the philosophical discussions and I’ve read many analyses of Dostoevsky and his works but this novel simply did not do it for me. \n\nI went in wanting to love the book and expecting something from it, which I am realizing might be why my expectations were not met, because I am fascinated by existentialism, rationalism, and nihilism which is the basis of the arguments led from the concepts from it. I wish I appreciated it as much as other people have and I will reread it at some point but I was wondering if anyone else simply didn’t enjoy sitting down and getting through it.",

So, my junior year, I decided to take AP English Language and Composition.\n\nBad idea.\n\n1) The side of rhetorical analysis and argumentative essay is something that doesn't come whatsoever naturally to me, it's been extremely hard trying to learn it when it seems I can't comprehend it. It's burned me out.\n\n2) The class at my school reads several books in the year, all of which are pretty dark nonfiction books that I've severely hated. I've had to annotate each one, mostly looking for rhetorical strategies, and meet deadlines for pop quizzes on what's happened in each chapter. \n\nI've hated these books. They've also majorly burned me out.\n\n\nThe class has led to major burnout and also a lack of a will to read for my own pleasure. I got some new books at the library yesterday and started one, and I was having so much fun.\n\nThen I realized, well, shit. Part 3 of In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is due later this week.\n\nNow I'm reading In Cold Blood and absolutely dragging through it because I have no choice but to read and annotate it. Everyone + my teacher tells me to take AP English Literature next year, and then judges me when I inform them I won't be doing so. \n\nHelp?",

        "text": "The Great Gatsby is a fantastic work of literature. Nick Carraway is our passive protagonist in the novel and doesn’t have a huge role in the goings on of the book. Instead, he serves as the portal for the average American to look in on the world of the wealthy—Gatsby, the Buchanans, Jordan. After a recent nervous breakdown, the recent veteran and midwesterner y into the world of Uber wealthy New York. He’s an innocent in the world of the Buchanan’s casual acquaintances with gamblers, rum runners, and unending partiers. His shock is genuine in some of these encounters. \n\nAs a character, he is worthy of a prequel. \n\nBut I’m not sure “Nick” is what Fitzgerald would’ve wanted. Smith’s Nick is world weary and decidedly not the innocent of Fitzgerald’s novel. Smith’s Nick stalks women after the war ends and returns not to his midwestern home but to a New Orleans of madams and cheap liquor. He is brought along as a tough to a shakedown by a madam and helps as muscle to a fellow veteran. It’s hard to imagine this character becoming the wide eyed shocked innocent of Fitzgerald.\n\nSmith does give Nick moments of passive viewer of life that Fitzgerald so well conveys. There are times where it is apparent Nick will sink so far into himself that he could just be an observer. And Smith delivers Fitzgeraldian prose when using Nick’s voice. But the innocence and nobility is gone. Fitzgerald’s Nick disapproves of Tom and Gatsby’s affairs. This Nick pursues his own. \n\nAs a stand alone, this us a great novel. But, for me, it’s not the prequel Gatsby deserves.",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Just wanted to come on here and warn y'all about Jack Edwards' youtube subscription he's offering. TLDR; Please do not join; it is essentially a scam. \n\nDisclaimer; we wanted to sort this out in private and reached out to him over discord to make our concerns known to him. This isn't the first he's heard of this, and we've been left with no choice but to talk about this publicly because he's 1) still offering this service on his channel to unsuspecting fans knowing he's produced nothing, and 2) has made no steps to fix this.\n\nAs y'all might know, Jack Edwards started offering a subscription service at the beginning of December. He first offered it at a much steeper price point (around £20 a month), but after a bit of backlash, he did change the prices to 1.99 and 6.99 a month. As part of the subscription, we were offered; \n\n\\- A members-only Q and A \\*monthly\\*\n\n\\- A discord server where he would post daily questions to prompt discussion and interact with us. \n\n\\- Replying to at least 40 member comments on each video\n\n\\- 'bring your own book' live streams with the member community \n\nHe also told us to drop our amazon wishlists in a post and that he would buy a few of us a book from there.\n\nLike many others, I joined in December and was very excited to meet a community of like-minded people. The discord took a bit to set up, and there were no mods, bots, roles, or rules, it was very bare-bones, but it worked for what it was. In the beginning, there were consistent questions, and he was interacting with a few of us, but as time went on, there started to be days when we wouldn't get those daily questions. He also had not held a single live stream or uploaded a Q and A. We figured that maybe he was really busy or there was something going on, so we didn't complain as it had only been like 6 weeks. \n\nFast forward to February, and the daily questions were getting far more sparse. At this point, we had been paying for 2 full months and had still received no content. We started to get annoyed but we decided to make a joint message for Jack to see, expressing our frustrations. It was really kind, and he went so far as to thank us for our message saying; \"Thank you for the kind and understanding message and also for your patience\"\n\nIn this message, he apologised, explained that there was a technical issue that was now fixed (even though he could've communicated that through Discord or done a live stream/ chat on there) and said that content was coming as soon as he got back from his trip to Dublin, where he was receiving an award of some kind. He said he would film and post an \\*extra\\* long Q and A to make up for it. We thought that would be the end of it. \n\nSince that message which was sent on the 7th of this month (so exactly 2 months since the launch of the subscription), he has ignored our messages on discord and hasn’t posted any daily questions or any of the content he offered. It has now been nearly 3 weeks since that message was posted and he's done nothing to remedy the situation \\*or\\* take accountability. \n\nAt this point he has made a minimum of £3,000 and has produced zero of the content he promised us. We understand that he might be going through something, but the fact of the matter is that he’s still offering a service to his fans that he’s not capable of fulfilling for whatever reason. We have been incredibly graceful but it’s been 3 months of membership and in this economy, most of us don’t have money to burn for a creator we trusted to deliver on his promises. \n\nWe obviously feel \\*SO\\* frustrated and like we've been grifted by someone we trusted. I'm not coming on here with any intent to cancel him, or say he's a terrible person. I feel like he has made a mistake (call it out of character if you'd like) that has cost his fans a lot of money and he deserves to be called out on it. I also just want to make sure that no one else loses money like us, and to make it clear that he is not delivering on the content he offered.",

        "text": "When I wanted to get into Sci-Fi, I looked into several recommendation list, and Foundation always came pretty high on these lists. It's heralded a sci-fi classic. Yet it is so bad that after reading it, I'm starting to challenge the general definition of 'Classic' as far as literature is concerned.\n\nAt first, I thought it would be pretty easy to complete because it is relatively short for a sci fi novel. Just 70,000 words. I was hoping it would be fast paced and cut right to the meat of the story without fluff and redundant descriptions/world building. But no. I was wrong and bored to tears by the novel.\n\nNothing happens for pages, ten thousand words, but just dialogue between characters about some future events or past events. No much description of these characters, they all feel like talking heads, and since the story is told from several character POV, you can't invest in any of the characters.\n\nI suffered through the book, unable to read no more than 4,000 to 5,000 words per week. Sometimes, I'd take entire weeks or months off, because there's really no reason to go back to it. I should've DNF it. But I kept hoping it'll get good, enough to prove it as a classic read.\n\nOh God. To compound the issue, the prose is boring. The sentences are cumbersome and easy to get lost or confused by. The pacing is poor. Plenty of telling rather than showing. And even when the writer shows, it's tedious to follow and visualize what he's showing.\n\nI'm a writer myself, and if write a book like this and send it off to traditional publishers, it will be rejected. Better books than this have been rejected or panned, so how does Asimov's book become a classic?\n\nHe was only 21 when he wrote the story, therefore hardly a skilled writer. He wrote all 70,000 words in roughly only a month, implying he never took the time to properly develop his ideas and refine his writing.",
