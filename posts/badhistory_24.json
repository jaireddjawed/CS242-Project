In both subreddits people immediately clamored for its submission to r/badhistory, so I have taken it upon myself to do so.\n\nTo be clear, the comment has since been deleted, and the poster in question claims that he was being \"facetious and melodramatic.\" I'm skeptical, but if you buy it, it forgives the overheated rhetoric, which is beyond the purview of this subreddit anyway. \n\nHowever, I don't think it adequately covers for the shockingly errant take on Roman history. I was reluctant to submit this myself because I know little to nothing about Caesar or Ancient Rome, but this is such a slam dunk that I feel on safe ground. The tiny bit of knowledge I have is more than enough to debunk this.\n\nFirst off, the first thing anyone knows about Caesar is that he was a goddamn military dictator. He was not a proponent of republics. He was specifically murdered because he wanted more power. This is so basic that a ninth-grader could point it out. \n\nSecondly, Caesar's assassination can hardly be said to precipitate the fall of Rome or Europe. The Roman Empire lasted for centuries afterward. It is an utter mystery where this person got the idea that Caesar's murder led to the downfall of Rome.\n\nThirdly, I understand that the myth of \"The Dark Ages\" as an era of widespread ignorance and misery is a major pet peeve of r/badhistory. You call it \"chartism,\" right? \n\nLike I said, this is just the basics. More details always welcomed.",

        "text": "As an experiment we're trying out a flair for posts that have comments that add significantly to the original post and are worth reading. This is intended to work in two ways:\n\n- To give some recognition to commenters who put a lot of effort in writing an excellent comment that allows you to learn a lot more about the topic\n- as a neutral tag indicating that the discussion in the comments adds value to the topic being discussed and is worth reading. This means we're not using it as a judgement on the quality of the original post. \n\nWe went with \"**Valued Comment**\" as the flair name because anything better was too long to be really viable to use as a flair. If you're good at naming stuff, please feel free to suggest a better name. It's gold to indicate that we give the comment Reddit Pyrite because we're cheap. \n\nTo give you an idea of the type of comments we plan to use it for, here are a few examples:\n\n- The comments expands on a small item in the original post. For example: bad history post is about the Marian Reforms in the Roman army, and one of the commenters decide to write a huge post about Marius' life. Not super relevant to the topic, but fascinating anyway.\n- The comment offers another viewpoint that supplements the original post. For example: the main post is about Churchill's writings on his capture and subsequent escape during the Boer War and someone writes an impressive comment about how captain Haldane wrote about Churchill in \"How we escaped from Pretoria\".\n- The comment offers another viewpoint that disagrees with the original post. This would be in case the original post contains bad history on its own, is too black and white in its viewpoints, or there is no historical consensus on the topic, but the ensuing discussion in the comments corrects this and adds so much value that its worth leaving up because of that alone.\n- Any significant expansion on the original R5. For example someone spots some bad history on which they're not an expert, but want to post about anyway and submits it with a good R5. Then an expert jumps in and adds their knowledge to the R5, adding far more depth and information. OP still deserves high-fives for an awesome post, and the commenter is recognised with a polite applause and a \"Bis! Bis!\" from the Ivory Towers of Academia.\n\nThe main point I'm trying to make with this extensive explanation is to show that in most cases it isn't meant to signify that the original post is lacking in explanation, or low effort. It's an indication that there's more to be learned in the comments.\n\nWe'll run it for a month or so to see if it works, and if it's not too much work for the mods to keep an eye on these.",

One of the earliest examples was the Fritz X anti-ship bomb, first deployed by the German Air Force in 1943: An operator on the launch aircraft guided the bomb to its target using radio control. Around the same time the U.S. Navy deployed an even more sophisticated anti-ship bomb called the Bat, which used radar to home isolate the target without needing a human operator. Another anti-ship homing weapon was the Zaunkoenig torpedo, fitted to German U-boats from 1943 onward, which used underwater sound waves rather than radar to locate the target.\n\n\nNoooope. The US developed their own guided weapons during WW2 *in parallel* to the Nazis, no \"stealing\" necessary.\n\nExamples include the [Naval Aircraft Factory TDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Aircraft_Factory_TDN) and [the GB series of guided glide bombs](http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/gb.html).\n\nEven more to the point, the concept of a guided missile goes back considerably earlier than WW2, and [the first known experiments weren't carried out in Germany at all, but in Britain.](http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.6834?journalCode=jjp) So the actual title here, for this entry at least, is \"Nazi Wunderwaffe that they totally ripped off from the Brits.\"\n\n&gt;Long-Range Missiles\n\n&gt;While all the major powers fielded short-range rockets, only Germany put serious effort into the development of long-range, liquid-fueled rockets. The result was the V-2, a 14-ton, vertically launched missile with a range of 200 miles and a top speed of 3,500 miles per hour. The V-2 was one of two long-range weapons deployed by the Germans, the other being the V-1 flying bomb. Both the V-1 and the V-2 were launched in the thousands, mainly against London and Antwerp in Belgium. The V-1 was the ancestor of today’s cruise missiles, while the V-2 was the world’s first ballistic missile.\n\n[Too easy.](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/history/dr_goddard.html)\n\nOh what they *really* meant is that ze Germans actually designed weapons to drop explosives at long range without using piloted aircraft? [Yeah, that's a totally unique concept.](http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/html/mshwfug4.htm)\n\n&gt;Airborne Units\n\n&gt;It was the Germans who seized on the potential that paratroopers gave. Such troops fitted in perfectly with Guderian’s vision of lightening war – Blitzkrieg.\n\nActually, [they ripped off the Slavic untermenschen.](https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Inside_the_Blue_Berets.html?id=AHHfAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y)\n\nI'll leave the Guderian Blitzkrieg throwaway as an exercise to the reader.\n\n&gt;Helicopters\n\n[Try Russian-American.](https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/aerospace-defense/igor-sikorsky-aviation-pioneer)\n\n&gt;Jet power\n\n&gt;The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first jet airplane used in combat and it was very effective against Allied bomber formations. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union seized Me 262s as they captured German territory and reverse engineered the German planes. While neither country would finish building jet aircraft during the war, when American F-86 Sabres later faced off against Soviet MiG-15s in MiG Alley over Korea, it was a fight between Me 262 descendants. Similarly, the U.S. captured the Arado Ar 234 jet-powered bomber. Technology from the Arado would go on to be found in the U.S. Army Air Force’s B-45s and B-47s.\n\n[Badge engineered Me-262?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK2DqtnJI5U)\n\nOf course, [Italy](http://www.comandosupremo.com/italys-first-jet-campini-caproni-cc-2.html) and [Britain](http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=123)  developed jets independently, and [early Soviet jets were inspired by British, not German, designs.](http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/nene.html)\n\n&gt;Rockets\n\n[This shit again?](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/history/dr_goddard.html)\n\n&gt; Methamphetamine\n\nLet's let them have this one.

        "text": "I was bored and figured that I might be able to find some quick and easy examples of badhistory by simply typing ‘conservative history’ into the Facebook search bar. It didn’t take long to find this gem: \n\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jhtj9p8ev/\n\nFor those unable to access the photo in question, it is simple enough to reconstruct. President Reagan determinedly stares slightly off screen in front of a billowing American flag, a simple three line refrain trailing off below him and into the mostly black framing:\n\n&gt;IN 1986, WHEN [REAGAN] WAS PRESIDENT, LIBYA KILLED AMERICANS. \n&gt;HE BOMBED THEIR LEADERS HOUSE. LIBYA WAS QUIET FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS.\n&gt;UNTIL SOMEBODY APOLOGIZED.\"\n\nThe poster frames this as a conservative history lesson for ‘leftist jackwagons'. So the main idea here is that Ronald Reagan bombed Muammar Gaddafi’s house in retaliation for killing Americans in 1986, and that Libya was ‘quiet’ and presumably not killing Americans anymore after the bombing.\n\nI was curious if this somewhat simplified sounding narrative could hold up to some scrutiny.\n\nOn April 5th 1986, the La Belle dancehall in West Berlin was bombed by Libyan agents and resulted in the immediate deaths of two people: Nermin Hannay, a Turkish woman, and Sergeant Kenneth T. Ford. A second American serviceman, Sergeant James E. Goins, died two months later from wounds related to the bombing. Hundreds more were injured from the blast.^1\n\nOn April 15th 1986, the United States launches Operation El Dorado Canyon, a series of airstrikes on Libyan airfields, air defense sites and most famously the Bab al-Azizia barracks - Gaddifi’s headquarters.^2 President Reagan explained the action in a televised address, stating: ''When our citizens are abused or attacked anywhere in the world, we will respond in self-defense...If necessary, we will do it again.''^3 The operation resulted in two American fatalities, the death of Gaddafi’s 15 month old adopted daughter, between 15 and 30 civilians and an additional 45 Libyan military casualties.^4\n\nNow, the pedantic bad history is obvious from this brief timeline. While multiple Americans were killed in 1986 by Libyans, only one American had been killed prior to Reagan bombing Qaddafi’s house. Two more Americans were killed during the course of the action itself, and another well after the retaliatory bombing. So we can see that the facebook post in question distorts what actually occurred - I suppose the author didn’t want to let the chronological record get in the way of their rhetorical stratagem. \n\nOnto the non-pedantic, super bad history. Libya was far from quiet following the El Dorado strikes - in fact, it seemed to more-or-less pursue its agenda of covertly funding or aiding terrorist and radical organizations into the late eighties, such as the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in September 1986, attempting to run Soviet arms to the IRA in 1987, and most importantly, the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - more commonly known as the Lockerbie Bombing, which the Libyan government accepted responsibility for in 2002. The Lockerbie bombing was an exceptionally deadly act of terrorism *which resulted in the deaths of 270 people, 178 of which were American citizens, including four government officials.*^5\n\nIt’s pretty clear that both the formulation and conclusion of the post in question is a severe distortion and obscuring of history - the idea that Reagan’s military response to Libya’s sponsoring of terrorist activities either kept Libya from killing Americans or caused Libya to cease its activities for nearly twenty five years is simply not one that is based in any kind of reality.\n \nSources:\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Berlin_discotheque_bombing\n\n[2] http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/u-s-bombs-libya\n\n[3] http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/15/politics/15REAG.html?pagewanted=all\n\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_United_States_bombing_of_Libya#U.S._forces_and_targets\n\n[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103#Passengers\n\nEdited for formatting because this is my first real reddit post and I have no idea how to do it right.",

Examples of such responses include:\n\n&gt;Yeah, and the Nazis made massive scientific breakthroughs.\n\n[Link to response](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4a8vuw/if_we_chucked_ethics_out_the_window_what/d0yhv08)\n\n&gt;Look at how fast science was developing by German scientists when they tossed ethics out\n\n[Link to response](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4a8vuw/if_we_chucked_ethics_out_the_window_what/d0ybtrs)\n\nIn particular, many of these people refer to the \"discoveries\" that the Nazis made in the Dachau Hypothermia Experiments, the general argument being that much of what we know about frostbite and hypothermia comes from Nazi science. Thankfully, there are some other responses in the thread questioning the validity, or lack thereof, of these experiments, but I thought I'd go into a little bit more detail here. Even if we disregard the ethical dilemma posed in the original question, or the faulty assumptions that it makes to begin with (namely, that ethics is the major bottleneck \"holding back\" scientific progress), the notion that we discovered valuable data from Nazi torture is demonstrably wrong. \n\nFirst, the doctor in charge of the experiments, Dr. Sigmund Rascher, was under intense political pressure to produce results, which lead to much of the data from the experiment being falsified and the conclusions not accurately reflecting it. In fact, Rascher was\n&gt;accused of financial irregularities, the murder of a German assistant, and **scientific fraud**. Dr. and Mrs. Rascher were subsequently executed [on April 26, 1945], presumably on Himmler's orders. \n\nAdditionally, the experimental design and the way the data was recorded was flawed, as\n&gt;The descriptions in the Dachau Comprehensive Report of the design, materials, and methods of the experiments are incomplete and reflect a disorganized approach. Only an impression of the scope of the study can be formed from the fragmentary information provided. The size of the experimental population and the number of experiments performed are not disclosed. Only from postwar testimony do we learn of 360 to 400 experiments conducted on 280 to 300 victims — an indication that some persons underwent more than a single exposure.\n \nand\n&gt;Such basic variables as the age and level of nutrition of the experimental subjects are not provided, and the various study subgroups are not segregated. The numbers of subjects who underwent immersion while naked, clothed, conscious, or anesthetized are not specified. The bath temperatures are given as ranging between 2 and 12°C, but there is no breakdown into subgroups, making it impossible to determine the effect of the different temperatures.   \n\nand\n&gt;Blood pressure was not measured. Cardiologic monitoring was limited to heart sounds and electrocardiography, but in the shivering victims no tracings were obtained during immersion or after removal from the bath. Therefore, dangerous or even fatal cardiac arrhythmias escaped detection during the unmonitored periods.\n\nand so forth. In short, the methodology of Nazi \"science\" was thoroughly flawed and unscientific, being politically motivated and lacking proper controls. Their basic approach was \"let's starve and cut off the limbs of this filthy Jew/disabled person/etc. and see what happens.\" \n\n\n[This](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199005173222006) is the source that I used, the pertinent bit is:\n&gt;This review of the Dachau hypothermia experiments reveals critical shortcomings in scientific content and credibility. The project was conducted without an orderly experimental protocol, with inadequate methods and an erratic execution. The report is riddled with inconsistencies. There is also evidence of data falsification and suggestions of fabrication. Many conclusions are not supported by the facts presented. The flawed science is compounded by evidence that the director of the project showed a consistent pattern of dishonesty and deception in his professional as well as his personal life, thereby stripping the study of the last vestige of credibility. On analysis, the Dachau hypothermia study has all the ingredients of a scientific fraud, and rejection of the data on purely scientific grounds is inevitable. They cannot advance science or save human lives.  \n\n\nI would also like to add, as a little aside, that I think the people complaining about the inconveniences of ethics in scientific studies would be singing a much different tune if *they* were the ones being tortured by the Nazis.\n   \n\n\n\n",

Obviously after reading about uninhibited repression and violence against millions of people, what immediately springs to mind is the equally troubling injustice described in that myriad of \"is social justice censoring our universities?\" articles that sprung up in middlebrow magazines throughout 2015.\n\nI'm definitely not here to argue that these articles don't have merit, or to disagree with ServetusM about the \"white privilege\" concept (which I will avoid going into). My (R5) point is that ServetusM trivialises the history of China's cultural revolution and distorts it to make a grossly ahistorial attack on his strawman version of white privilege.\n\n&gt;The whole concept of 'white privilege' is the exact type of ideological taxonomy Mao used to vilify people (Except he tended to use social status over ethnicity, but when you hear people discuss what 'whiteness' is, you realize that it's often used the same way in America). In fact, many of the terms Mao used for counter-revolutionaries roughly translate into the English concept 'privilege' or various forms or another. It is a kind of labelling system seen broadly in witch hunter scenarios, a flexible label that can single handily reduce someone's position in another person's eyes and reduce any arguments they make to being simply propaganda from people looking to protect their 'privilege' (Or ideology).\n\nFirstly, no it is definitely not the 'exact' type of ideological taxonomy. If I was going to be generous I'd say that they could both be thought of as labels, however in no way are they equivalent or of the same 'exact type'. For one, if he had been paying attention ServetusM would know that to be identified as a counter-revolutionary by Mao's government was to be accused of resisting the process of revolution within the structure of Communist theory, and hence an agent resisting the proletariat class' claim to the means of production and hence Marx' end of history. By contrast 'white privilege' is a much more open ended concept without this kind of official conceptual baggage.\n\nSecondly it is not \"used the same way\" in modern America. In Maoist China, to be identified as a \"counter revolutionary\" was an official designation by the state that would result in the literal and physical destruction of artefacts and texts, and sanctioned repression and brutality towards people.\n\n&gt;The point being that things like the cultural revolution rely on the market place of ideas being closed. \"White privilege\" is a concept Mao himself would have enjoyed a great deal, because it quickly distills a complex set of social issues down to 'this group is bad, don't discuss things with them' (Even if the rhetoric around it says people shouldn't feel bad about their privilege--the way it's used in conversation is almost always meant to disrupt and shut down the conversation, or make the observations of those with privileged less poignant, less empathetic). This is the problem with broad labels--in reality, some people were just bad, or willfully mislead others, 'white privilege' had nothing to do with it, it was based purely on ideological sympathies overruling empirical reality, which happens for every ideology; from Catholicism to Communism to Fascism (But this is another troubling similarity with the modern PC movement, that feelings towards things&gt;&gt;empirical evidence, which is a tactic Mao also liked to use, because it made it even easier to facilitate the above, where people can brush aside the empirical reality in order to defend their ideology, because it 'feels' right. And making people 'feel' good with righteous indignation is very easy, and a great way to manipulate a mob.).\n\nOur friend not only kicks off with a bold declaration that he knows what Mao would have thought, he implies that Mao's chief characteristic was that he would \"reduce complex things down to labels\" as if he was nothing but a demagogue rather than a Marxist theorist in his own right.\n\nFrom strength to strength ServetusM makes another sweeping, perspective-lacking comparison between the social justice movement and Catholism, Communism and Fascism because they all featured \"ideological sympathies overruling empirical reality\". At this point he stubs his toe on the idea that because the \"modern PC movement\" leans more towards the idealist end of the idealist/materialist philosophical spectrum (or has he puts it, feelings towards things&gt;&gt;empirical evidence), it must share some ideological space with fascism, which is widely held to have begun with the \"fin de siècle\" theme which rejected materialism and rationalism at the beginning of the 20th century. [1] However, just as abruptly, he wanders back into confusion by accusing Mao (who sits within the thoroughly materialist Marxist school of thought) of the exact same thoughtcrime.\n\nHence SeretusM's mischaracterises and abuses the history of China to make a petty and barely formed point.\n\n1.

        "text": "This is my first submission to /r/badhistory. I hope this post doesn't embarrassingly backfire. I'm not a historian, but I do know a bit about certain historical periods.\n\nA [quote](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E1D61631EF34BC4953DFB166838D679FDE) from the New York Times, 1866, to grant us a historical prologue:\n\n&gt;\"There is, in political geography, no Germany proper to speak of. There are Kingdoms and Grand Duchies, and Duchies and Principalities, inhabited by Germans, and each separately ruled by an independent sovereign with all the machinery of State. Yet there is a natural undercurrent tending to a national feeling and toward a union of the Germans into one great nation, ruled by one common head as a national unit.\"\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n[**THIS POST FROM THIS TIL THREAD:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4a05wc/til_that_there_have_been_five_attempts_to_ban/d0wfx1g).\n\n&gt;I presume you mean Prussia and not Germany. The closest thing to 'Germany' as a state at the time was the Holy Roman Empire, which was lead by the Austrian Habsburgs, not the Prussian Hohenzollerns. Though there was the region of Germany (which, at the time also included a ton of lands not within Germany today) but Frederick the Great wasn't particularly worried about them.\n\n&gt;I found it more interesting when you said that he saved Germany during the Seven Years War, when he was at war with Austria, which was the leader of what one would consider Germany at the time.\n\n\n\nThe major problem with this post is Austria somehow being the leader of a Germany which didn't exist.\n\n----------\n-----------\n\n**PART 1**\n\n* Firstly, to say, \"*The closest thing to 'Germany' as a state at the time...*\" is disingenuous, because no one really understood what Germany was at that time, as stated by that 1866 NY Times quote. \n\n* Secondly, the Holy Roman Empire was not technically German. At times, it was ruled by [Spaniards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), [Czechs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), and other nationalities.  For example, in [1519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_election#Election_of_1519) there were no German contenders for the Imperial throne. Henry the VIII of England and Francis I of France both competed for the Imperial throne. The winner, Charles V King of Spain, didn't even speak German.\n\n\n\nWe have just established that the HRE was not Germany; and, that the idea of Germany was incomplete.\n\n------------\n------------\n\n**PART 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;MOST IMPORTANT PART&lt;&lt;&lt;**\n\n\nI won't open the can of worms that is the Napoleonic Wars, but...\n\n* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/gVuhZwM.jpg) is a map of Europe after the Congress of Vienna in 1814. \n\n* The HRE evaporated from the map thanks to Napoleon, and the [German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation) took it's place in 1815. The German Confederation consisted of 39 German states, dominated by Austria and Prussia. This is known as the [German Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Question), which states:\n\n&gt;*Großdeutsche Lösung (\"Greater German solution\") favored unifying all German-speaking peoples under one state, and was promoted by the Austrian Empire and its supporters. The Kleindeutsche Lösung (\"Lesser German solution\") sought only to unify the northern German states and did not include Austria; this proposal was favored by the Kingdom of Prussia.*\n\n------\n\n* The German Question would be answered in [1866](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War). After a dispute over administration, the mastermind Otto von Bismark orchestrated the Austro-Prussian War. \n\nConsequences of said war:\n\n1. Dissolution of the German Confederation.\n\n2. Formation of the [North German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_German_Confederation), dominated by Prussia. \n\n3. Austria is excluded from the North German Confederation. \n\n4. Austria becomes the duel monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\n\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIn 1870, four years later, the Franco-Prussian War happens. On [18 January 1871](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I,_German_Emperor#Emperor), King Wilhelm Hohenzollern I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor by the North Germanic Confederation. By this ceremony, the North German Confederation was transformed into the German Empire (\"Kaiserreich\"). The rest, as they say, is history. \n\n-------\n\n-------\n\n\nSO.....Austria was clearly never the \"rulers\" of Germany. German unification is confusing.\n\nThank you for reading. I leave you with this [fancy tune](http://youtu.be/3iaEUWHVI2Y)\n\n\n------",

        "text": "The beating of dead horses has always been a tradition valued highly among the ranks of us redditors. We as historians (the armchair ones too!) fulfill this task in our own special ways. [With fancy top-hats.](https://i.imgur.com/WTDnnwE.gif)\n\nTherefore it should be no surprise that as soon as i layed my eyes upon [this](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006051527263) 10 year old post on Yahoo Answers i had no choice but to get out my [Macuahuitl](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-6/675_01_2.jpg) and start the whacking.\n\nIn the linked post a user asked:\n&gt; *\"What was the main economic activity of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan?\"*\n\nTo which another user (named Grumpy Kansan (Please keep this in mind, i will be referring to them by that name)) replies that it's most important activities were it's role at the top of the aztec empire, agriculture and commerce. This is not completely wrong, but isn't completely right either. So i'm going to show you why. In the meantime [take a seat](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeekPeskyCockroach-poster.jpg) and enjoy the show.\n\nNow the first one of these points, the one about it's position as the head of an empire, is acceptable to me. The *tenochca* (The inhabitants of tenochtitlan) received a variety of tribute from the [different provinces](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/images/354/35413.png) of the empire. Ranging from foods like beans and maize, to resources like feathers or wood ([which was apparently not for sheep](http://preshrunk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wood-for-sheep-300x300.png)), and of course things like cocoa beans or cotton blankets, which were both used as a kind of currency, the tribute that arrived in tenochtitlan had a profound impact on its economy. (Whew, what a sentence...)\n\nThe third point (commerce) can be accepted too, if taken with a grain of salt. In their answer Grumpy Kansan refers to multiple markets, which is a good thing to do (Yay!). The market of Tlatelolco is described and praised for its grandeur and all the different goods that were sold there. This leads many people talking about [Tenochtitlan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Murales_Rivera_-_Markt_in_Tlatelolco_3.jpg) to overlook all the smaller markets that were spread out through all the different districts of the city. But while this may evade perpetuating one kind of bad history it fails elsewehere (Booh!). It is important to note that the one market that had a greater economic impact, extending over the city limits, **was said market of Tlatelolco**. Tlatelolco was technically an independent *altepetl* (city-state) for most of its existence, and was annexed only roughly 50 years before the [destruction of Tenochtitlan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Leutze,_Emanuel_%E2%80%94_Storming_of_the_Teocalli_by_Cortez_and_His_Troops_%E2%80%94_1848.jpg) (And yes, that picture is of course a prime example of staying realistic). So naturally this point only really counts for this section of time, if we are being pedantic, which should be obligatory [seeing in which sub we are](http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/10/Wasnt-me-GIF.gif?gs=a).\n\nThe second point (Agriculture) was what really caught my eye. While agriculture certainly held some significance for Tenochtitlan, it is questionable to see it as a large economic factor, if you don't restrict yourself to the valley of mexico as a whole, but only to Tenochtitlan.\n\nIn their sources Grumpy Kansan refers to the *chinampas* of Mexico regarding this point. Chinampas are a type of [\"floating\" gardens](https://midwestpermaculture.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chinampasImage.jpg) used especially on the lakes of the valley of mexico (You can look at some additional pictures on [this website](http://chinampas.info/) if you want.). Since they were crisscrossed with little channels they could be easily traversed with a canoe. Also they allowed for great harvests if planted with multiple crops at the same time. As a little cherry on this [agricultural milkshake](https://www.decorcentral.com/images/D/IMS101-L-01.jpg) you could even find some edible animals in the channels of the chinampas. Like this happy [axolotl](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/17/article-2326057-19D49A37000005DC-864_634x419.jpg). Alongside these more direct purposes they also allowed for the ~~re~~clamation of land. (Inb4 the aztec were really just meso-american sea germans!)\n\nNow if they were as great as i said, [what am i on about](http://www.tvweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/blues-clues.jpg)? Well, all these great features made them a integral part of agriculture [**in the valley of mexico**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Basin_of_Mexico_1519_map-en.svg/2000px-Basin_of_Mexico_1519_map-en.svg.png), and their surplus was exported, making them also an important feature of the economy. But **for Tenochtitlan**, this is a questionable understanding of their purpose. Historians like Calnek concluded that the amount of *chinampa-land* in Tenochtitlan wouldn't have been sufficient to support the city with food, and de Rojas argued that some of the aztec conquests had the purpose of guaranteeing a food supply for the city. This means that the purpose of *chinampas* in Tenochtitlan was not really to yield a agricultural surplus to export, but rather to supplement the foods from the markets with some homegrown crops, or spices (Which was of course just a preperation by Moctezumah to take revenge on americans visiting taco bell).\n\nSaying that agriculture was an important economic activity is therefore a notion i would deter.\n\nNow the most glaring mistake of Grumpy Kansan's answer is actually what they fail to mention, not what they mention falsely (In contrast to a [donut](http://www.withsprinklesontop.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSC_0406x900.jpg), which is good because it leaves stuff out)!\n\nFor looking at this: let's split economic activity in three sectors, a primary (Productive sector producing raw materials), a secondary (transforming raw materials into other goods), and a tertiary (providing services). If we do so we would find most of tenochtitlans economy in the secondary and tertiary one! While i will spare you a whole and detailed description of all the different occupations in Tenochtitlan, i just have to at least name the important ones.\n\nOf course there were jobs in the primary one, like fishermen or salt-makers, but the other ones (especially the secondary) are arguably more important. Both the tribute that came to Tenochtitlan and the normally imported goods and raw materials were processed by the tenochca artisans.\n\nTenochca Pottery (Especially Black-on-Orange) was produced and exported in great amounts. Franciscan Friar Juan de Torquemada specifically mentions Leather tanners in his reports (Funnily enough because it was made using excrements, and Torquemada found this strange.). Weavers held a good position, since they did not only provided clothing but also produced valuable cotton blankets, [warriors uniforms](http://www.ancient.eu/uploads/images/3724.jpg?v=1431034669), or back-strap looms that were used by the [*tlameme*](http://www.arqueomex.com/images/FOTOSNUM81/05F01.jpg) (porters/carriers). Jewelry Makers, Metalworkers, Painters and Featherworkers were all highly praised (Yes, even by those pesky barbaric Spaniards!) and produced many luxury goods. \n\nIn the tertiary sector we have of course people like [priests](https://landsofleviathan.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/aoe.jpg), doctors and many administrative officials like judges, bailiffs, or of course the ruling class ~~[(a.k.a. the you know who!)](https://thisaintnews.com/static/user/pics/1400716800/1401225307_Jews-are-behind-Everything.png)~~. These probably didn't have that much economic importance for themselves, but since the ones that did like the *tlameme* (porters/carriers that were important as meso-americans didn't use animals to transport goods) and *pochteca* (Merchants) fall under \"commerce\" i will gracefully leave them out, as to not contradict myself. As said, these had an important role, but the whole Tlatelolco-Tenochtitlan relation is [a mess](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/61251663.jpg), and my pedantry forbids me to just let that claim stand as it was 10 years ago.\n\nTo end this monologue please take a look at the beauty that is one of [Grumpy Kansan's sources](http://www.civilization3.com/civoftheweek.cfm?civ=Aztecs)! Because nothing screams reliable source more than a \"Sid Meier's Civilizations 3\"-Wiki.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy main source for this post was *Tenochtitlan: Capital of the Aztec empire* by José Luis de Rojas (edited by Michael E. Smith), but i also used multiple smaller sources for specific statements, if you have a question about something particular i will be happy to provide the corresponding source, in the mean time please accept [this](http://i.imgur.com/pmsfk3Y.gif) corgi-gif as a substitute.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4a3mqy/in_which_the_head_of_the_east_india_company/",
        "text": "Hello felllow badhistorians, it's been almost a year since our last bit of bad sports history so here with a fresh dose is the head of the East India Company (EIC).\nMy professor showed us this video in class last week: [Sanjiv Mehta: the legacy of the East India Company](https://vimeo.com/29371436). In it we see the current owner discussing the company's legacy and the supposed 'good' it brought to the world whilst ignoring the more than a century of oppression it inflicted on the Hindustani people.\n\n\nBut today we're not going to focus on that, today we are focusing on the part that begins at 1:37. \n&gt; If you see the world without the East India Company, it would be a very different world. There would not be port and bridges in India, there would not be cricket being played outside of England. There would not be a game called badminton. I’ll probably speaking in French with you, tables of London would not have tea. The rugby, the tennis, polo, sailing as a sport would not have existed in global parts of the world.\n\n\nI am going to ignore the insanity of claiming that the EIC brought ports and bridges to India, and will concede that the Company may have at least been a contributing factor in the develpment of the anglophone world and the popularity of tea in Britain, as well as the development of badminton and polo, likely based on games played in India. However the other comments about sport are completely unfounded.\n\n\n**Cricket**\n\nCricket is a very old game and has been played outside England for centuries, in places far outside of the EIC's sphere of influence. Wikipedia notes the first reference to a game outside of England as taking place in Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire in 1676. The game also spread to Wales, Ireland and Scotlalnd without the involvement of the EIC though its popularity was never as great as in England. In the West Indies the game was introduced as a means of anglicising the colonised and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the US the game enjoyed widespread popularity among English emigrants. Cricket was one of the first organised team sports played in America and the first reference to it being played comes from a diary kept between 1709-1712. The game was particularly popular in New York and Philadelphia in the antebellum period.\n\n\n**Rugby**\n\nThe origin story of 1820s Rugby schoolboy William Webb Ellis picking up the ball and running with it is considered a myth these days by historians. By the 1830s and 40s the idea of running with the ball in hand had become a common feature of the football played at Rugby School, England. Although games had been played overseas previously, the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871 facilitated the games global spread with the first international game being played in the same year. Perhaps even more important was the transnational exchange of people and ideas of the late 18th century. Advances in communications and transportation, including steamships, railways, telegraphs, and printing, allowed both the game to spread as well as be reported on and dicussed. These developments took place after the Indian Mutiny of 1857 (or the First War of Indian Independence) which resulted in the take over of the EIC by the British Government in 1858. Thus the EIC was not involved in rugby's global spread.\n\n\n**Tennis**\n\nTennis as a sport was popular in the Middle Ages, particulary with English and French monarchs. This tennis was the ancestor of modern tennis and is commonly referred to as real tennis, usually played indoors with a different set of rules. The modern game would not exist until after the the decline of the EIC, 'invented' by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1873. Wingfield publsihed a rule book in 1874 and produced a box set which included poles, a net, rackets, balls and a set of his rules. These box sets would be sold abroad in 1874 and this lead to lawn tennis becoming popular around the world, eventually being played on many other court surfaces.\n\n\n**Sailing**\n\nThe history of the sport of sailing is a little more difficult to define. The idea of cruising or using water craft power by sailed for pleasure is an old one and has existed in many diverse cultures across history. Yachts more specifically developed in Holland (the word being Dutch in origin) and spread to England through Charles II who lived in there in exile. Yachting then spread to the American colonies. Although a race involving Charles is recorded, yacht racing would not become popular until the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Even then it remained a very elitist sport due to the costs involved and it was not until the 20th century saw the introduction of new shipbuilding materials and techniques that the sport became more widely popular. Again this development of the sport and its popularity have zero relation to the East India Company.\n\n\n**Extra: BadEtymology**\n\nMr Mehta also claims that the word cash comes from the EIC's role in history. The word *cash* ultimately comes from the Old Persian *karsha*, \"a unit of value\". Whilst karsha entered Sanskrit it also entered Latin and this is the true etymology of the English word. The Latin *capsa*, later leading to Middle French *casse* and finally *cash*. The earliest written forms of the word in English come from the late 16th century, before the Company even existed.\n\n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n**Sources**\n\nWikipedia used unashamedly\n\n\n[The Diffusion of Cricket to America - Dominic Malcolm](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6443.2006.00276.x/abstract)\n\n[The History of Cricket in the United States - Smithsonian.com](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/the-history-of-cricket-in-the-united-states-132185661/?no-ist)\n\n[William Webb Ellis and the Origins of Rugby Football - William J Baker](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4049045?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\n\n[Unexceptional exceptionalism: the origins of American \nfootball in a transnational context - Tony Collins](http://users.polisci.wisc.edu/schatzberg/ps616/Collins2013.pdf)\n\n[Origins of Rugby - RugbyFootballHistory.com](http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm)\n\n[125 years of Wimbledon - CNN.com](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/tennis/06/14/tennis.wimbledon.125th.anniversary.museum/index.html)\n\n[Golf &amp; Tennis - Robert Pruter](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118609446.ch13/summary)\n\n[Playing on the Field of Social and Technical Innovation: The Impact of the Sale of Lawn Tennis Sets in the Netherlands, 1874–1887 - J Luitzen, T Bollerman &amp; P Delheye](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523367.2015.1071356?journalCode=fhsp20#.VuQEvuKg-Wg)\n\n[History of Sailing in Competition - Talk Sailing](http://www.talksailing.co.uk/guides/history_sailing_competition.html)\n\n[History of Sport Sailing - The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia 6th Edition](http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/sports/sailing-history-sport-sailing.html)\n\n\nCash - Oxford English Dictionary",

        "text": "Here is the video I am talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tznEcq_r4KA\n\nNow Dan Snow isn't all that bad, the people telling him what to say about WW1 are telling him the right things. And this video isn't bad, it is mostly ok, but it breezes over a lot of stuff which the public really should be more aware of (ARTILLERY)\n\nso the video is not wrong, it just sort of circumvents the point. It constantly alludes to the importance of firepower superiority, but fails to adequately explain what it is, why it is important and how magazine rifles worked alongside machine guns and artillery.\n\nThe video also alludes to pre-war doctrine (one man could fire x shots per minute) but also doesn't take this line of reasoning further (and why it got thrown out the pram)\n\n\n\nSo we start off and we get straight into the not necessarily incorrect, but just bizarre comments\n\n\n**0:23** **the design of a weapons system tells you a lot about the culture which produced it**. (was the Lee Enfield in the arts and crafts style? YOU DECIDE)\n\n\nOh like the Prussian military culture (sorry I thought culture culture), the man and his rifle, the individual fighting qualities of the soldier, the superiority of the German people, a nation at arms. oh no, we have ignored all that sort of pre-war clap trap about morale battlefields and eugenics (if that isn't to do cultural history I don't know what is).\n\n\nengineering I suppose that is fair enough (although Britain was EXACTLY the same in this respect), \n\nevolved from a hunting rifle.. err wat. Nothing about any other Mauser designs, the development of bolt action rifles, the Dreyse Needle gun, Mausers in the Boer War. No 'developed from a hunting rifle', not developed after a long line of other military rifles.\n\n\nSo we haven't learnt ~~much~~ anything about German culture, or the rifle and its intended users (nation at arms, all that sort of thing, infantry doctrine, tactics ect.).\n\nThe idea of a rifle representing the culture which produced it is quite bizarre, considering both were modern magazine rifles. Now if you had 'military culture' instead, the military thought in the country, yes it could make sense, but the video didn't have that at all. Not even a passing mention about the man behind the rifle.\n\n\n**1:41** Dan Snow  **holding a chunky, solid, reliable weapon**. *You'll thank me later ladies.*\n\n\n**1:54**  Dubstep, on a WW1 video **-50 points** \n\n\n**1:58** **\"used by Hitlers bodyguards\"** is this designed to cause confusion, what has Hitler got to do with WW1, couldn't they give a WW1 fact. Pretty sure Hitler's bodyguards used the Karabiner 98k anyway which was actually a shortened version of the G98, so technically not the same weapon.\n\nI speak to enough people to think WW1 had Hitler in it (in a capacity other than soldier), I remember when we learnt about WW1 in school most people were confused them. This video will only continue this misconception.\n\n\n**2:10** so the Germans get a little fact but the Brits don't. Couldn't you have written **\"used by Churchills bodyguards\"**, I think the audience needs this sort of Hitler vs Churchill WW1 sort of confusion.\n\nWhy didn't you tell us about the culture behind the rifle like you ~~did~~ didn't about the G98, (I can't seem to get over talking about the culture behind rifle design, then not actually mentioning culture). Maybe something about small proffessional army, Boer war perhaps, no? ok. High rate of fire useful in colonial campaigns where a small force was often pitted against a much larger one?\n\nnot even a smidgeon about fighting qualities of the individual soldier (basically a preoccuption of the British establishment following the Boer War), not even a sidenote, no, fine ok, its not as if the BBC's mantra is *\"inform, educate, entertain\"* or anything\n\n\n**2:56** your script didn't tell you why the bolt action is different did it? This is an engineering thing but I think they could have at least tried to explain it a bit. The Lee Enfield is a cock on close action, this means there is no resistance when opening the bolt, the Lee Enfield has less locking lugs there is less friction when opening and closing the bolt. You could have said, the Lee Enfields bolt was smoother because it had fewer locking surfaces, maybe you could have even gone for the German over-engineering angle.\n\n\n**3:06** DUBSTEP LEE ENFIELD MACHINE GUN, CUT, CUT, CUT, WAOW CHIKKA CHIKKA BANG BOOM, quick more cuts, we need to make this thing look like an MG, because Snow talked about Mons but is a complete noob at operating the rifle. Also about Mons, German tactics (lack thereof) greatly contributed to their casualties, nothing about foreshadowing the course of warfare for the next 4 years, come on you TV people love those sorts of generalisations. I would wager that even if the British army had been armed with the G98 at Mons it still would have been a bloodbath for the Germans.\n\n\n**3:30** \"its a small difference, but its a really important one.\" Yes ok mad minute (without actually using the phrase \"mad minute\" I might add) we get it, but actual machine guns were more important than riflemen masquerading as machine guns. And artillery was more important than machine guns, it was the key to the advance, and the key to a defence. He says a lot about firepower superiorty, but not about the different assets it involved, namely the artillery. It is all well and good telling us how superior the Lee Enfield was to the Mauser, but if this superiority was so large, why then did trench warfare develop, why could this overwhelming superiorty not give Haig the breakthroughs he so dearly wanted. (is it because of things like artillery?)\n\n\n**4:29**, misspelling of 'smelly' (they put smellie, thats just weird)\n\n\n**4:49** \"its only 500metres\", there is no such thing as only 500metres, I think you meant to say only 50 metres. At 500metres your sight would completely obscure a man sized target (I have shot a Mauser at 500yds and the foresight completely obscured the man sized target.\n\n\n**5:58** Firepower revolution, YES YOU SAID THE RIGHT THING, why didn't you make the whole video on that though. AND WHY NOTHING ON ARTILLERY, QF guns, no nothing ok whatever. Magazine rifles were a revolution in firepower (in the 1890's and 1900's when they were first introduced).\n\n\n**6:10** \"this is why no mans land became a killing zone\", surely suppressive MG fire combined with artillery in German defence in depth systems is more relevant than rifle fire. FREAKING ARTILLERY AGAIN, plz just say 'combined with artillery' at least. Tell me how infantry worked within the wider war machine, please. Artillery fire killed and wounded more men than rifles ever did.\n\n\n\n\n**so what did we learn**\n\n* the SMLE was best- ok fair enough\n* because rate of fire is more important than everything else- correct\n\nit took you 6 minutes to tell us what I just summed up in two short statements. And you didn't even mention machine guns or artillery. Now there is a seperate video on machine guns, but once again it doesn't go beyond the point of this machine gun is the bestest. Or how they were deployed by the Germans in conjunction with artillery, with Dan Snow left, right and centre declaring British weapons were best, its a wonder why the war lasted 4 years. (they even have a Lewis gun, that is literally gagging to be put with the rifles and compared, also nice completely ignoring the Madsen...)\n\n\n\n* the video was called rifles of WW1 yet he only looked at two rifles, I would have picked up a Lebel at least considering how much fighting the French army was involved in.\n\n\n* the video doesn't have a conclusion which says how infantry worked as part of a wider war machine\n\n* the video doesn't mention machine guns or artillery\n\n* the video doesn't talk about bayonets (thats why the rifles are the length they are, to give greater reach)\n\n* the video doesn't talk about the decisions behind adopting the rifles (morale battlefield, pre-war stuff, it glances around them)\n\n* the video doesn't talk about artillery (I said this already, but it is a really important omission)\n\n* the video doesn't talk about how the rifle was used within each army, tactics ect.\n\n\n**there wasn't really any education value in this**, I think they made it so they could show Dan Snow holding his chunky, solid, reliable weapon\n\n\nthe main problem was the constant skirting around important points like doctrine. He didn't really talk about how warfare developed due to focussing so narrowly on two rifles.\n\n\nnow you may be saying 'but as a video on two rifles it is fine' that is precisely the problem. It is a video on two rifles in isolation. The public only absorb so much (as is evident from the comments of the video which are mostly firmly anchored in 1960's historiography), so when you make a piece on two rifles, they go away thinking the rifle was the war winning weapon, when in fact if one was to choose a single 'war winning' weapon it would be artillery.\n\nI have yet to see anything produced by the BBC which talks about artillery, or doctrine at all, they have Garry Sheffield (and his war of attrition against Haig's dejectors) writing BBC iWonder articles for them. Why don't they stick him in front of a camera so he can mislead everyone about Haig (he wasn't as bad as popular history states, but that doesn't mean he was excellent, the learning curve is a myth developments were often sporadic, even tank-infantry cooperation in the BEF did not filter down to all units, some divisional commanders failed/refused to implement it, certain army commanders were just bad yet retained their positions, battles were dragged out for far too long despite diminishing returns)\n\n\nNow I have to admit a bias, I have been looking for a means to get a dig in at Dan Snow for a while, unfortunately the people who write his scripts are good at their jobs, and this video presented a rare opportunity to vent anger and frustration when someone says \"have you heard what new cutting edge research Dan Snow has presented\" and you reply \"you mean that that line of thought which has been around since the 1980's\"\n\n\nFurther reading, for anyone who wants to know more stuff about British army weapons and doctrine\n\n\nTim Travers *How the War was Won: Command and Technology in the British Army on the Western Front, 1917-1918*\n\nShelford Bidwell &amp; Dominick Graham *Fire-Power: British Army Weapons &amp; Theories of War 1904-1945*\n\nMatthew Ford 'Towards a Revolution in Firepower?

We are taught of them as a good thing and one of our the best times in history. We weren't the worst conolizers, hell, I'd say we were the best. We did slave trade, but so was everyone. And we ended it, almost ahead of everyone. We weren't chopping of heads and hands like belgium in Congo. \n\nthe popular idea that the Portuguese were *gentle* colonizers -and the notion that to argue for a different historical narrative would just mean serving a PC agenda- is not only a despicable one, but also a perfect example of how 'two wrongs don't make a right'. more, it's not that accurate after all: just to cite *one* example, I recall the [massacre of Wiriyamu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Aj-Hd2ldU). edit: another[ source](http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/history/massacres/19730710_hastings_story.pdf), in English.\n\n&gt;And that shows. We still have a really good relationship with our former colonies.\n\nthis is highly subjetive. what defines a good relationship? somehow it seems to ignore the notion of an [economic world system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-systems_theory#Immanuel_Wallerstein) where the former colonies are still under economical exploitation or, at least, where the contemporary power relations between the former metropolis and colonies might still prevent a totally free and harmonious relationship. it also ignores the notion that this supposed good relationship benefits national citizens differently, still reproducing internal inequalities based on class or gender, and therefore making it clear that the relationship isn't that good for *everyone* or, at least, not to the same degree. \n\n&gt; Apart from Brazil and African Countries we just wanted some ports to have economic power. Lagos in Nigeria, Manilla, Macau, Goa are good examples of port towns we had. As an adult, I don't beat my head with it. We did a lot of good stuff with colonialism. Did some bad stuff. Actually proud such a small nation was able to have such a large empire and after all these years still maintain good relations.\n\nthe implied idea that these ports were somehow autonomous/independent or that we did it, not for the sake of our imperialistic economical reasons, but for the altruistic sake of developing those ports. moreover, who gets to determine whether the Portuguese did a lot of good stuff with colonialism? that is, good stuff... for whom?  \n\n&gt; We have a better relationship with african countries than the US has with it's african population, \n\nthe whole comment is self-serving and uncritical, but this sentence is just crazy talk for comparing our relationship with African countries, with the way the US integrates its own citizens. \n\n&gt; and ours is pretty much 100% integrated.\n\nwe definitely also have our integration problems based on race, albeit obviously at a smaller, Portuguese, scale.",

        "text": "So a passage from “What They Never Told You in History Class” showed up on my Facebook feed. Going from Amazon the book appears to be a typical piece of Afro-revisionist, the kind that claims the pyramids weren’t built by ethnic Egyptians. So already you can tell this is going to a weird place.\n\nAnyways the anecdote I saw on my feed:\n&gt; “The First President of the United States was a black man, a moor. Washington was not the first president of the United States. He was the 9th. The real first president was John Hanson… They tried so hard to cover his accomplishments as a leader.”\n\nAs a history geek, I had to investigate such a bold claim. It seems that the confusion originates from there being two separate men named John Hanson. I’ll go into the lives of both to show that they couldn’t possibly be the same man.\n\nThe first Hanson was born in April 1721 in Maryland on the Mulberry Grove plantation, to Samuel and Elizabeth Hanson. Samuel was a documented political figure in having served two terns on the Maryland General Assembly. John Hanson’s political career began in 1750 as sheriff of Charles County; seven years later he represented the county in the lower house of the Maryland General Assembly until 1769. There he protested the Stamp Act and Townsend Acts. He then moved to Frederick County, serving several prominent positions: county treasurer, deputy surveyor, and sheriff. In 1775, Hanson went to the Maryland Convention signing the Association of Free Men. As the conflict escalated Hanson went on to chair Frederick County’s committee of observation, being a man of wealth he often paid the soldiers out of his own pocket due to lack of funds. By 1780 Hanson was a delegate to the Second Congressional Congress, rising to president the following year. By all accounts he didn’t enjoy the position, citing overwork and poor health. However, he was urged to remain as there was not yet a quorum to selecting a successor. Hanson retired from the job in November 1782, having served for exactly a year and a day. He died a little over a year later of poor health. Hanson is sometimes promoted as America’s first true president, though it’s interesting to note that a key figure in that campaign was a biological descendant, Douglas T. Thomas. There are a few surviving portraits of him\n\nWe’ve much less information about the second John Hanson, but we know enough to realize he couldn’t possibly have been the same one from Maryland. This Hanson was an advocate of the now mostly forgotten American Colonization Society, urging African-Americans to relocate to Liberia. He served as senator for Liberia’s Grand Bassa County. He died in 1860. There is a least one surviving photograph of him. \n\nThe genesis of this bad history seems simple enough; somebody got the two confused and stated that they were the same person, not having checked the facts. From there it spread, often being using by revisionists to propel the myth that early America wasn’t that bad for black people. This is of course as offensive a statement as one can write, and it highlights a troubling trend in Afrocentrict bad history: white historical figures are race-bend while the real black history goes ignored.\n\nAlso calling black people Moorish in the 21st century? Come on guys, you sound like Cyril Burt.\n\nSources: \nLevering, Ralph B. (1976). \"John Hanson, Public Servant\". Maryland Historical Magazine 71 (Summer): 113–33.\n\nMereness, Newton D.

        "text": "[Le source](http://madmonarchist.blogspot.com/p/myths.html)\n\n&gt;  What about cruel monarchs like Nero or Attila the Hun? Surely no benefits could be worth risking leaders like that!\n&gt;Actually, far more people have been butchered in wars or massacred by those in power since the start of the revolutionary period than in all history previously. Nero or Attila the Hun were unsavory characters but nowhere near as bad as republican monsters like Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong or Pol Pot. It has only been in the post-revolutionary era of mass politics and political ideologies that governments have taken to killing their own people in huge numbers. Nero was cruel to his own family and later persecuted Christians who were still a tiny minority and Attila the Hun, as ruthless as he was toward his enemies, ruled his own people well from what we know and with justice. No monarch ever wiped out as many of their own people as the communist dictators of the Twentieth Century, all of whom did so in the name of “the people” and “fairness”.\n\nR5: This whole argument relies on some very bad statistics. The tens of millions of people killed by \"republican monsters\" (Communist and Fascist leaders) died in the twentieth century, which saw incredible population growth. Populations in [2000 were roughly 10x those in 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates). Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, but the rise of republics and constitutional monarchies occurred at the same time that improving economies and living standards resulted in huge population growth. It is very bad historiography to compare a raw death toll from 1400 (when world population was only 400,000,000) with one from a 20th-century world with ten times the population. [This chart](http://imgur.com/vGIdfhy) from /r/dataisbeautiful inflates historic massacres and famines to their 21st-century equivalents. Note that most of the \"republican monsters\" either vanish or drop far down the list of butchers; Genghis Khan, a monarch, is responsible for the single largest death toll, followed by the Mideast Slave Trade (largely perpetrated by and under sultans and caliphs), the Xin Dynasty (monarchs), Timur Lenk aka Tamerlane (a monarch), An Lushan (a revolt against a monarch), the fall of the Ming Dynasty (monarchs), the fall of Rome (monarchs), the Muslim conquest of India (more monarchs), etc. The first such event to have a strong influence from republican ideals is World War II, which doesn't even crack the top ten. Mao, Stalin, WWI, and the Russian Revolution are even further down. If you don't like the comparison of individuals, wars, dynasties, and centuries-long slave trades, Steven Pinker has compiled an [alternate list](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-devastating-war-in-human-lives-adjusted-for-world-population); WWII ranks ninth, Mao eleventh, and Stalin fifteenth. ed: Here's a [third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll), unadjusted list showing only wars (no lengthy conquests, slave trades, or dynasties). Factoring in that population in 1400 was 1/5th of that in 1950, the following wars are deadlier per capita than WWII+the Shoah using maximum estimates:\n\nThree Kingdoms War (40m x 5 = 200m WWII-equivalent casualties)\n\nQing Dynasty conquest of Ming Dynasty (25m x 5 = 125m WWII equivalent)\n\nAn Lushan (36m x 5 = &gt;150m)\n\nTamerlane (20m x 5 = 100m)\n\n**WWII (85m)**",

This will involve links because this is about an image.\n\nSo the following link is from a video titled \"Titanic: The Shocking Truth\" which exists on YouTube under various names. The most recent and popular one being \"The Best Titanic Conspiracy Documentary (2012)\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4x56PCOalk\n\nStart at 1:32 for what this post is about. There is more to the video but I just want to address the name in particular to show the depths that the video goes to.\n\nSo it talks about how the name \"TITANIC\" was riveted onto the hull instead of engraved, thus allowing the letters AN to fall off and reveal the letters MP. This would indicate that the wreck is in fact not Titanic, but her elder sister ship Olympic that was sunk in an scheme to collect the insurance.\n\nSo here's a video of Titanic's name engraved on the wreck.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKaTNLBc1Q\n\nWhat's going on? Well, the MP is CGI. I'm surprised that the same generation that takes such pride in pointing out how bad CGI is in modern movies can't spot the issues with that video, particularly contrasted to other parts of the dive footage.\n\nThe name TITANIC was in fact engraved onto the hull. Furthermore, it was on a single plate so a partial reveal is impossible. Either all of Titanic's name would be there or none of it. It would also make no sense to put Titanic's name over Olympic's since the best option would be to remove Titanic's name and replace it with Olympic's. The video also suggests that you can cover up an O with a T and no one will notice.\n\nThe following is an image of Olympic shortly after launch starting to be fitted out.\n\nhttp://orig11.deviantart.net/ca13/f/2011/203/8/5/rms_olympic_by_chris2027-d41c6wy.jpg\n\nNotice how far apart the letters in the name are. At least their own width apart.

People eventually became lazy, and with recording down information very difficult at the time, lots of valuable information was lost throughout generations creating a less educated group of Romans which was eventually overthrown.\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/49qvm5/what_if_the_romans_developed_a_printing_press_and/d0u33ae)\n\nNow the comparison with ancient records' being difficult is being made with the printing press and that's pretty fair. It's a bizarre claim to see that Rome lost a significant amount of written information within the span of the Empire itself given that Roman records are our only source of written text about that period. All of the \"barbarians\", the Goths, Vandals, Suebi, Franks, Alamanni, etc. histories are inherently biased from the Roman point of view since none of them were either contemporaneously literate or none of their writings have survived. The fact that the oldest texts we know of in Europe are Latin or Greek copies of even older works shows that it was a very common responsibility of the educated to preserve their writings.\n\nNow it's true that the barbarian-born *magister milita* such as Stilicho and later Ricimer wouldn't have received the same classical education that earlier emperors did, but that isn't a sliding scale and had its ups and downs in how educated emperors tended to be. During the third century many provincial generals were elevated to emperor based on their military accomplishments alone and the fickleness of their troops but once Diocletian took power in 284 there was again a pretty consistently educated ruling elite. The assertion made above is bad history because there's no indication that there was a general decline in Roman education nor that what may have been less stressed owed in any way to the Western Empire's dismemberment.

White \"Christian\" Americans reframed this as an \"North Korean aggression\" to start the war in the name of \"self defense\".\n\nFirst off, they accuse the Americans of starting the war.  This is untrue.  Kim Il sung wanted to unify the Korean peninsula by force, even against the wishes of Stalin.  The idea that America wanted the war is patently false considering that they didn't invade until well after the North Koreans committed many atrocities and nearly took over the entire peninsula.  Also, the US was demilitarizing at a furious rate, while the North was militarizing with the help of the Chinese and the Soviets.\n\nIronically the OP talks about \"Christian\" Americans without mentioning that Kim Il Sung himself was a Christian; his grandfather was a Protestant minister, and his parents were very religious.  It's said that even after the founding of the DPRK, he continued to meet (in secret) with ministers from the West.  Most notably, Billy Graham was invited to the DPRK and held personal audiences with Kim.\n\n&gt;China, wanted to protect its borders from western imperialists.\n\nFurthermore, China did not want to \"protect its borders from western imperialist\".  My this time they had already invaded Tibet, East Turkestan and Manchuria, and as such were in essence an imperialist power by that time.\n\nThe post also largely ignores the atrocities committed by the North Koreans and Chinese, glossing over the rape of South Korean women and children.  The official NK propaganda is that the KPA was some sort of moral exemplar, but it's based upon a specious argument without any substantive basis.  In fact, when the American military came to Korea it's well known that they engaged in wide humanitarian projects.  The KPA however would tear them down simply for being built by the Americans.  Therefore North Korea's tirades represent not only a denial of reality, but also an especially unsavory sort of intellectual poison which ranks among the worst representatives of negative revisionism alongside Holocaust Denial.\n\n&gt;Dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea - mostly on North Korea compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of ww2. North Korean population centers were ruthlessly blanket bombed by these racist psychopaths.\n\nThe firebombing of Korea was tragic but necessary in the long run.  It was not meant to be a genocide as the OP of that thread claims.  They UN was afraid that this would be the fuse that ignited the Cold War, so they used this as their last resort.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/49l669/northern_ireland_not_a_good_analogy_for_internet/",
        "text": "A friend of mine sent me on an article about why we should probably not argue in circles forever or be smug about people who decide they’ve argued a position enough. It was a pretty good article. Unfortunately, it also linked to [this article on why we should be nice to each other while arguing]( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/). It also wasn’t a bad article overall, with an [optimistic, if clichéd message]( http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Wouldn't_It_Be_Nice_If_Everyone_Was_Nice). Unfortunately, it chooses *the worst possible example to demonstrate it*. Northern Ireland.\n\nAlright, full disclosure; I’m not a historian. I wouldn’t even consider myself an amateur historian. I like history and think it’s really interesting to learn how smart people were in the past! In my own past, I’ve probably been somewhat guilty of thinking the “man, why were people back then so *dumb*” – fortunately, that was when I was in my teens and I managed to grow up and realise how full of shit that idea was. So, the only reason I feel alright talking about this is that I actually used to be on the side of those who dismissed Gerry Adams as a terrorist, as if that was enough to delegitimise one of the guys instrumental in achieving peace. It was actually [this interview with on the Late Late Show, Irish Version]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kS-4tpsXsU) that convinced me to take him seriously and try to examine the actual causes. That said, I’d still consider myself indifferent to the overall fate of NI as a region – if the majority there want to rejoin Ireland, grand – if not, that’s also fine, provided people are treated fairly. I am, I guess, [freestater scum]( http://i.imgur.com/lRmiTaQ.jpg). Such is life.\n\nI probably don’t need to say this but, suffice to say, they’re complicated.  Really complicated, even if you only start from the 1960s. I’ll be using [this site as my main source for the purpose of this post]( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html), but I can get more specific if people would like me to/feel it would be beneficial.  I think it’s a pretty good overall source, but I’m aware that it probably has a lot of flaws that I can’t see – obviously the main one is that the quotes are often removed from context and may not represent the overall truth.\n\nThe most important point is that it wasn’t that some individual Catholic or Protestant who decided it’d be good fun/divinely justified to start murdering the other group. It wasn’t even one particular group. I stop before saying it was the entire British Government – but it was the overal governance structure led to what are colloquially known as The Troubles. I’m just going to deal with the escalation period.\n\nOnce WW2 ended, things were...quite stable in NI for a while. Unfortunately, the welfare state was not implemented equally at all. I’m not going to claim Catholics didn’t benefit at all from it, but it disproportionately favoured those of Protestant faith. This is, essentially, the cause of the civil rights march in Derry, 1968. [Chapters 3 and 4 of the Cameron report]( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cameron.htm#chap3) of a report made to the British Parliament in 1969, deals with a lot of the background. It talks about the Civil Rights Association in NI, a group trying to peacefully resolve cases of prejudice against Catholics. In particular, they gained prominence in their efforts to deal with the unfair allocation of social housing; it was primarily Protestants who were benefiting it, through political favours. \n\nSo a large conglomerate of peaceful (well, mostly peaceful) groups gathered together and marched about it in Dungannon, where a particularly controversial case was found. I guess they were choosing this as their Rosa Parks moment. And it was fine – there were no incidents to report at that first march on either side, which was an encouraging result for those interested in a peaceful approach to resolving legitimate issues. The parties then decided to march again, this time in Londonderry, a stronghold of the Unionists in literally every sense – historically, it was the site of [a reasonably famous siege]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Derry) back in the day. It’s still a controversial place to be honest. Edit: As was pointed out by TheStalkerFang, while it's a stronghold for Unionists in many ways, its population is majority nationalist.\n\nThey oragnised the amrch for the 5th of October. In response, the Apprentice Boys of Derry suddenly planned a march of their own to clash with it. In repsonse to the response, the Minsiter responsible for such activities, banned all marches on that day. This is the first sign that the analogy the author is going for doesn’t make sense – this isn’t just “some protestant”, it’s a government minister, acting on behalf of British rule.\n\nThe fallout was that, instead of a rather small and uncontroversial protest it became symbollic of the oppression they viewed as going on there. I’m not sure it’s fully justified, but I can’t help make a comparison with the execution of the leaders of the 1916 rebellion – until they did that, most “regular” Irish people didn’t really approve of it. After that happened, suddenly people started getting a bit angry. In that case, it eventually culminated in revolution. In Londonderry  the number of attendees jumped, they were suddenly dealing with a large scale protest. Not just of the proletariat, a small number of Westminster MPs and Stormont MPs (the NI government) joined in the protest, to highlight the issues facing Catholics in the North. Until the police forcibly stopped them marching, it was a peaceful protest. I think it’s very important to note that. And again, it undermines his analogy; this an organised, public group of Catholics with clear goals that could be engaged with. Not one maniac trying purely to make things worse for all protestants.\n\nThe march was not dealt with well. \n\nIt’d be unfair to say it’s entirely the police’s fault. The crowd was full of young, unemployed angry men and they did try to provoke the police into responding, throwing signs and banners and (probably) rocks. They were asked repeated to leave. Unfortunately, the other end of the street was blocked by another group of police officers, who didn’t realise the crowd was being ordered to disperse, and had blocked the street, which left people feeling trapped. It was violent, and a show of force on the part of the government to quash what had been, until then, a peaceful protest. The result was riots.\n\nThings simmered down somewhat, in terms of violence at least. Small marches and sit-ins were held after that, however, when they planned another large march (peaceful again), the Minister of Home Affairs had banned marches for the month of November. On the 16th of November, a march 15,000 strong took place. While tensions rode high, no actual violence occured – lucky for the police who were there, as the force deployed was totally unprepared for violence if any had occured. It was a tense time, definitely. I have huge respect for the likes of John Hume for his efforts to keep things peaceful, but productive. He definitely wasn’t giving up the struggle, but he felt like it could be achieved through peaceful means. \n\nCertain steps were taken by the government at the time to try and meet these needs, in response to these protests. These were felt to be inadequate and other marches and sit-ins took place, often resulting in minor incidencts of violence. I hesitate to put all the responsibility on the heads of the Unionists, but they certainly had a large part in why tensions mounted, especially the likes of Ian Paisley (the same Ian mentioned [at the start of this performance]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi0hMMExw_E) of Hand Me Down My Bible). But I’ve written over a thousand words at this point, so I’m going to just mention the last big moment, which is pretty well known.\n\nIn 1969 troops were deployed to help control the situation. Naturally this wasn’t received well. My main source from this – taken from the above website – is [Submission to the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions: The Murder of 13 Civilians by Soldiers of the British Army on 'Bloody Sunday', 30th January 1972]( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/birw.htm). I don’t feel like the title is an exaggeration either.  A brief timeline is: \n\n*\t9th of August,  1971: Internment without trial is introduced.\n*\tA 6 month ban on public protests is put in place.\n*\t900 people are imprisoned without trial by the end of the year, the vast majority nationalists.\n*\tThe Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (the same ones who organised the other attempts at peaceful protests) organise a march in Londonderry for the 30th of January 1972.\n*\tAnother “religious march” is organised by the Unionists – again, it’s called off while the CRA’s march went ahead.\n\nThe march went ahead as scheduled. The armed forces from England were told to be ready to be fired upon and advanced as if they would be. The march proceeded peacefully and avoided direct confrontation for the most part. The small element that try to attack the police – with rocks only – was easily repelled with rubber bullets and water cannons. At 16:07 the army was ordered to begin a pre-arranged arrest operation. At 16:10 shooting began.  From the above report: “Under 30 minutes later, 13 civilians were dead and another 13 lay injured.” These are the agreed upon facts. To look back over them and try and ascribe it to a small seed group of Catholics/Protestants who decided to kill each other and then decided to stop is not just wrong, it’s literally the opposite of the point he’s trying to make.\n\nTo me it seems like the lesson is: “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.”",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/49jexb/bad_medieval_weapons_history_or_how_i_became/",
        "text": "Deciding that this subreddit hadn't quite had enough of riffing on bad pop history documentaries, I decided to take another stab at Conquest, that classic of bad pop history made somewhat bearable by a somewhat charismatic English presenter.\n\nThis one is a doozey. *Weird Weapons of the Middle Ages*, covering such strange, esoteric designs as...The mace. We'll get into that later. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmDER4qovS8) if you want to watch along.\n\n1:08: *Broadsword* isn't really (to my understanding) a weapons category in the Middle Ages. Nor is it particularly accurate for a knight of this period, even if he is on foot, to use a sword and shield - while shields did continue to be used by knights, the arming sword (and similar swords) have always been a sidearm. He'd probably be using some kind of polearm. \n\n1:35: I know I'm skipping over the part with the bow here, and we could be here all day discussing the relative penetrative power of the longbow, but here we get into bad crossbow usage. The myth that it takes a minute to wind up a crossbow is false unless you're using more specially designed siege crossbows that were designed to be used in situations where the archer could take cover after loosing the bolt. \n\n1:47: I'm going to skip over this and hope one of my fellow badhistorians can add stuff about early medieval firearms, because I, not unlike Jon Snow, know nothing about this topic.\n\n2:12: *\"Time and time again plate-armored knights defeated hordes of unarmored foot soldiers.\"*\n\nBecause of course, opposing armies wouldn't have their own knights in shining armor. Like, I get what the presenter is getting at, and obviously the well-armored, well-equipped warrior caste was a factor on the battlefield, but the fact remains that the lion's share of medieval armies *weren't* made up of peope dressed head to toe in heavy armor. \n\n3:41: Now, I'm not completely up to date on my sword typology, but I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be some variation on a two-handed sword, which notably *weren't in use in the Middle Ages*. Two-handed swords became a fixture of Renaissance battlefields because of their ability to break up pike formations. You'd never bring one of those to a duel (which, let's face it, that's pretty much what this is.) More importantly, a greatsword doesn't weight *that* much (the heaviest were around 4-5 kilograms.) Also, why is the presenter trying to hit him with the middle of the blade and from such close range when the sword's point of percussion is much further up?\n\n4:08: So the presenter has just talked up how plate armor had its gaps, and so he goes on to make his point by trying to stab through the thickest part of a breastplate with an arming sword. I'm not sure I see the logic here. \n\n5:08 - 6:03: Hoooo boy, let's begin with a simple question. Why in the heck isn't the *knight* using a shield? Mail armor was very effective protection, but medieval art still depicts knights carrying a shield. What kind of knight would go into battle dismounted, armed only with a spear and absolutely nothing else? Again, I don't have enough experience with axes to know whether the discussion about them is accurate, but I *do* know that edge alignment is a problem with swordfighting as well, and not a problem unique to axes. In other words, if you're bad at using your weapon, you're not going to do very well with it. A very salient point. \n\n6:03 A falchion is a weird weapon *how*, exactly? It was in use throughout pretty much the entirety of the Middle Ages and many of the surviving weapons of this type are engraved with the names of landed people. \n\n6:20: Ah, the favorite of pop historians everywhere - cleaving through flimsy pieces of fruit in order to demonstrate the badassness of a new weapon. \n\n6:28: Ah yes, let's slap a guy in plate armor with a big heavy weapon *right where the armor is most difficult to penetrate* to demonstrate its badness. Coupled with the guy in mail armor somehow being thrown to his feet when faced with a single, two-handed stroke from a MIGHTY PLATE ARMORED KNIGHT.\n\n6:40: There's that 'broadsword' term again. A broadsword, my English presenter friend, is a basket-hilted sword from the early modern period. What you're holding right there is a sword. There, no need to attach all kinds of labels to it - this isn't a D&amp;D sourcebook.\n\n6:58: I don't know enough about estocs (besides the fact that it literally meant *thrust*), so I'm going to let this one slide. Again, I implore my fellow badhistorians to help a brother out.\n\n7:21: Okay, so we have the classic 'priests weren't allowed to draw blood' myth nonsense. This is a story that keeps being perpetuated in spite of medieval poems like the *Song of Roland* featuring depictions of Archbishops riding into battle and wailing on people with swords. \n\n7:47: Time for 'extras flailing around in the background while the presenter does something cool.' And of course you had to get in close, that's the whole point of having a *melee weapon*. You're not going to be standing fifty feet away and throwing it at them. That only works in the movies. Also, once again, WHY IS HE USING A SHIELD AND WHY IS EVERYONE ELSE USING CLEARLY-INEFFECTIVE-AGAINST-PLATE-ARMOR SWORDS AND SPLITTING INTO LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE DUELS? WHYYYYYYYYYY\n\n8:44-9:04: The taking of political prisoners was obviously a very lucrative business in the Middle Ages, but it *does* beg a question - why is this considered particular to the *mace*? The objective of almost every weapon is to neutralize your opponent, either by killing him or ensuring that he does *not* get up to try and stab you back. \n\n9:05: Knights *were* men-at-arms. The term man-at-arms just referred to any professional soldier who fought in heavy armor. Knights were the class of men-at-arms who were part of the gentry, but there's no sharp class distinction. The taking of prisoners would also depend on the nature of the battle - the Wars of the Roses were infamous for the amount of nobles who were killed by the opposing faction in the fighting.  \n\n9:18-9:58: This just seems like a strange aside rather than being related to the point of the video (highlighting 'strange' weapons). However, getting down on your knees to stab someone in the face in the heat of combat seems counterproductive when you could just ask one of your mates with a heavy polearm to, say, crush him while he's down while you move on to the next man. To my understanding, the 'running around the battlefield knifing wounded or unimportant people' happened when there was a lull in the fighting, not while the melee was in progress. \n\n10:13: So this is the only weapon in the entire showcase that's actually weird. I guess it's also another example of the presenter FLAILING AROUND (I'll be here all day!)\n\n10:30 Goodbye, *very* dead unarmored peasant facing off against a group of heavily armored men. We hardly knew ye. \n\n10:30 onward: I don't even know, guys. I'm just gonna go pretend to drown my sorrows in milk or something. \n\n13:48: Actually, a *bec de corbin* is a somewhat more literal thing - a specific kind of polearm that's very similar to the Lucerne. However, for the fear of this rapidly devolving into [an Order of the Stick bit](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/images/oots0136.gif), let's skip over the various pedantic definitions and just say 'it's a two-handed warhammer,' not a specific name for the armor-piercing spike depicted on most warhammers. It also had a significantly longer handle than the weapons depicted on the show.\n\n14:23: That doesn't look like a very significant penetration, but otherwise I've got nothing to add here.\n\n14:48: I believe we've already had quite the lark as far as the idea of being able to chop through the haft of a spear so simply, so I'm going to skip over this point. \n\n15:09: Going to skip the ahlspiess because I know nothing about it, but I'm going to bring up another point: The spear was useless (or at least very ineffective) against plate, which is why it was very rarely seen on late medieval battlefields, having been replaced with some variations of polearm, *including the next weapon they're looking at.* Again, in the interest of not repeating the Order of the Stick skit, I'm just going to say that different cultures employed different kinds of 'choppy/stabby/spiky bit on a stick' and leave it at that.\n\n16:14: There we go. Again, considering that the show itself mentions that the billhook was one of the most ubiquitous weapons in medieval Europe, why is it a *weird* weapon again? I'm starting to think the show's definition of 'weird' is 'it isn't a sword lol.' I haven't found any evidence to substantiate the 'it was used by Alexander the Great's infantry', so again, I implore other, smarter people to educate me and the other ~~unfortunate~~ watchers.\n\n16:52: Was leather armor ever really that widespread? Padded jackets, sure, but I've never really seen any substantial evidence for leather armor being used, especially not as plate armor started to become widespread. It seems like another one of those 'I think I read this in a D&amp;D manual somewhere' examples of pop history.\n\n17:00: Knights of this period used polearms on foot as well. They might have been shaped differently, but fundamentally, the polearm has remained a staple of medieval warfare for a reason - if you can stab a guy and he can't stab you back, you already have an advantage, especially in dense formations, which is how these battles were fought, not as one-on-one duels. \n\n19:10: OH DEAR LORD IN HEAVEN WHAT IS THAT MONSTROSITY. For comparison, [this](http://www.liebaart.org/figuren/goedendr.jpg) is a goedandag. I have no idea what that unwieldy, nobbly monstrosity is, but I'm pretty sure it's not a goedendag. \n\n19:50: It's worth noting that this 'army of peasants and shopkeepers' was a pretty well-armed and well-trained militia, and that while the goedendag was used, the primary weapon of the Flemish at the battle of Courtrai was the pike, and that it had just as much to do with the fact that the ground wasn't conductive to a cavalry charge, which neutered the biggest advantage the French had. In other words, while the goedendag was supposedly present on the battlefield, it wasn't instrumental in the defeat of the French army. Also, I'm pretty sure the helmet is anachronistic for an early 14th century French force. It seems more suited to a knight circa the Norman Conquest. \n\n20:45: So the thesis of this entire video is 'just be more numerous than your enemy and you're going to win.' So, what was the point exactly? \n\nVerdict: Bad, but not as bad as the 'weapons of the barbarians' video. And not as bad as the episode on the bow which I might eventually get to if ByzantineBasileus doesn't murder me in my sleep for ~~poorly~~ riffing on his nemesis. \n\nSources: Wikipedia for most of the weapon images, a Danish volume named 'Hundredårskrigen' (literally *The Hundred Years' War*) for the descriptions of late medieval military tactics that are lightly touched on, and random Google searches for the dates of various battles. On that note, if people have additional reading recommendations for this topic (military history, weapons development, what have you), GIVE THEM TO ME. I don't have enough reading to do. \n\n",

It's pretty well researched, uses lots of primary documents, and tells the history of the Revolution from a perspective we don't normally see. I also like Ray Raphael in general as a historian (though I think his writing and his history both get better after this book).\n\nAnyway, he's talking about the Battle of Cowpens and relating the experiences of Jamie Collins, a young S.C. militiamen who fought in it. \n\nI'm going to quote this beauty of a sentence and let you military historians bang your heads against your desks for a bit:\n\n\"'Now my hide is in the loft,' he thought to himself as he ran from the furious charge of British soldiers mounted on horses, **lunging their bayonets** at the frightened men and boys.\"\n\n\nWhat the British Legion absolutely, 100% did not carry (at least the cavalrymen), were muskets with bayonets on them. What they wield are swords and fusils (which are muskets that are shorter than standard muskets, which give them easier handling on a moving horse).\n\nImagine, for a moment, the scene of *utter* chaos that would erupt the moment a Legionaire attempted to fix a bayonet to a musket while on a mounted horse? Or better yet, imagine what would happen when that same man took his rifle in both hands (because you can't really use a musket/bayonet combo in one hand) to lunge at an enemy soldier and, horror of horrors, he misses! Does he stab his own horse? Himself? Does his own momentum tumble him out of the saddle where he gets trampled under the hooves of his steed or that of his fellows? \n\nFor fun, here are some reenactors of the British Legion.

They'd play a more prominent role in later wars. I just couldn't think of a more appropriate comparison.)",

        "text": "I realise I’m getting repetitive now, but this is another post about Edward Herman – he just annoys me a lot. Though this is about Rwanda, not Yugoslavia, so at least that’s a change. So he recently gave an interview in which he repeated at length his denial of the Rwandan Genocide, and for the record, the interviewer, one Ann Garrison, also appears to share his point of view, perhaps even more so adopting the Hutu Power narrative. The original recording is [here]( https://kpfa.org/episode/project-censored-january-1-2016/) and a transcript is [here]( http://www.globalresearch.ca/rwanda-the-enduring-lies-a-project-censored-interview-with-professor-ed-herman/5502707). \n\nEDIT: I've only just realised after posting how bloody long this is. My apologies, but good effort if you persisted and read it all.\n\n&gt; EH: In this book, Ann, we describe the fact that Paul Kagame, the leader of Rwanda, has killed more than five times as many people as Idi Amin. He invaded Rwanda in 1990 and carried out a war of conquest there that ended sometime in 1994. He invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1996 and went in and out of that country for years, killing what the U.N. itself admitted was probably more than 4 million people.\n\nEr, sort of. Kagame is undoubtedly a despicable man who’s committed all sorts of war crimes, I don’t disagree with that. Nor do I disagree that the Congo Wars are in large part down to him. But that doesn’t make him criminally responsible for every single death that happened in or as a result of the Congo Wars (the vast bulk of those 4 million are only indirectly war-caused deaths). For example, is he responsible for the killings committed by Joseph Kony (yes, that one) and the Lord’s Resistance Army (who, as far as there are definable ‘sides’ in this conflict, are on the opposing side to Kagame) in the Second Congo War? Seems quite odd logic to suggest he is.\n\n&gt; He runs a dictatorship in Rwanda, where he gets 93 percent of the vote in a country where 90 percent of the people are Hutu who consider him to be a conqueror, a terrorist leader. And yet he’s considered, in the West, to be a hero, a savior. In The New Yorker, he was described as the Abraham Lincoln of Africa. For a man who has outdone Idi Amin, I think this is miraculous.\n\nAgain, sort of, but I can’t really go into the various shifts in Western attitudes to Kagame since 1994 due to R2.\n\n&gt; AG: In other words, everything we’ve been told is wrong. And I can add that the enduring lies are so successful that that includes much of what’s been broadcast here on Pacifica Radio and published in any number of left liberal outlets.\n\nI facepalmed again and again at the astonishing hubris of this statement. Ms Garrison, does it not occur to you that if not just the overwhelming mass of scholars, but also the vast bulk of people who share your political persuasions and even the people *on the very media outlet you’re speaking on* are convinced of these facts, then maybe they have a point?\n\n&gt; Any attempt to edit the Wikipedia entry on the Rwandan Genocide triggers so many edit alerts that it starts a Wiki editing war until the Wikipedia authorities declare a ceasefire with no changes made. That Wikipedia entry is all but written in stone.\n\nGood, then Wikipedia has at least some level of scholarly standards and prioritises reputable works and source over circumstantial crystal-balling by conspiracy theorists.\n\n&gt; AG: Since you’ve already given us some background and context, let’s start with Chapter Two: “The RPF invasion and low-level aggressive war that never was a ‘civil war.” People who know the story of the Rwandan Genocide only through the movie “Hotel Rwanda” are likely to think that it was an explosion of tribal bloodletting that began and ended in 100 days’ time in 1994. Those who know that it was actually the final 100 days of a four-year war are likely to believe that it was the end of the Rwandan Civil War. There is an entry in the Wikipedia on the Rwandan Civil War. Why is this an enduring lie?\n\nApparently Ann Garrison has never seen *Hotel Rwanda*, or she’d know that the civil war is referred to pretty regularly in it, as are the RPF (though they’re generally just referred to as the “Tutsi rebels”). This all appears in the film substantially before the genocide part of the film starts, and the RPF themselves appear near the end. Perhaps a typical viewers wouldn’t entirely understand the context, but they’d be hard-pressed not to know that there was a war going on.\n\nMore to the point, this is laughable considering the huge amount of effort informed commentators and observers had to go to convince Western publics and politicians that the war and the genocide were indeed separate (though of course linked) phenomena, to avoid dismissal of it as an inevitable and inextricable “tribal” war.\n\n&gt; EH: Well, there was no major ethnic conflict in Rwanda back in late 1990. What happened in October 1990 was an invasion of armed forces from Uganda. This was a group of Tutsi, several thousand Tutsi soldiers, who were part of the Ugandan army.\n\nThis is going to come up again. When the RPF need to be demonised, they’re a foreign Ugandan invading force. When the killings of Tutsis need to be excused, the RPF suddenly become native Rwandan Tutsis whom Tutsi civilians could therefore be a “fifth column” for. The deniers want to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nTo summarise briefly, the RPF was made up of Tutsi refugees from Rwanda, most of which had been expelled from the country into Uganda in or after 1959. Some of them, Kagame included, had aided Museveni in his seizure of power in Uganda, and thereafter been incorporated into the army (though few became Ugandan citizens). They’d formed the RPF initially as a political movement, hoping to return to Rwanda at some point. What’s more up for debate is what exactly their plans were. Some claim they always intended to use the Ugandan Army to build up their own separate militia with which they would invade Rwanda. Others maintain they would likely never have actually gone ahead with this had it not been for the rise in anti-Tutsi nativism in Uganda from the late 1980s. Regardless, in 1990, a few thousand Tutsi soldiers deserted from the Ugandan army, killed the border guards (funnily Herman and Garrison don’t mention that part), and crossed into northern Rwanda to begin the civil war.\n\n&gt; They entered, they pushed several hundred thousand Hutu farmers out of their homes in northern Rwanda, and they were pushed back, but they kept coming. And the United States and its allies gave them assistance. They pressed the Rwandan government to sign an Arusha agreement in 1993, which gave Kagame’s Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its army a lot of power in Rwanda. But it also provided for an election to be held about 22 months after the agreement was signed, and the RPF could not have won that election. So they made sure they didn’t have to win that election, Instead, they resumed the war on April 6, 1994, and by July 1994, they had conquered Rwanda.\n\nSo the US aided the RPF by pushing for a peace agreement which was bad for the RPF? Genius logic. Also the “the RPF could not have won that election” claim - Herman is going to repeat this several times over.\n\n&gt; So the whole period from October 1990 to, say, July 1994 was a period in which the RPF was engaged in subversion and readying itself for a final war of conquest. So it was a war. I would say this was a war.\n\nWell, I’m glad we needed Edward Herman to tell us that the period from 1990 to 1994 in Rwanda was a war. No-one else had worked that out at all.\n\n&gt; AG: OK, now let’s consider Chapter Three: “‘Hutu Power extremists’ did not shoot down Habyarimana’s Falcon 50 jet.” Juvenal Habyarimana was the president of Rwanda from 1973 until he was assassinated in 1994, a little more than a year before these elections were supposed to happen. He was a Hutu, a member of Rwanda’s Hutu majority who had overcome centuries of Tutsi subjugation with independence in 1960. He died while returning home, along with Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira, also a Hutu, when his plane was shot out of the sky above Rwanda’s capital Kigali.\n\nOK, simple things first – Rwanda’s independence was in 1962, not 1960. Also, to talk of “Tutsi subjugation” of Hutus is either adopting the Hutu Power narrative or being incredibly ignorant of Rwandan history (or likely both). Prior to Belgian rule (1918-1962), the Tutsis and Hutus were not so much ethnic groups as social castes. The Tutsis were clearly set above Hutus, but one could move between the two – successful Hutus could become regarded as Tutsis, and poor Tutsis could become regarded as Hutus. I’m far from an expert on this process, and I don’t know the details but the central point is that before Belgian rule, it was as much the case that being a wealthy elite was what made you a Tutsi as vice versa. When the Belgians took over from the Germans (who had ruled Rwanda since the 1880s), they transformed the categories into hereditary ethnic groups, blocking mobility between the two.\n\n&gt; After four years of war and massacres, which had driven a million Rwandans to the outskirts of Kigali, where they were camped as internal refugees, this convinced the Hutu population that the Tutsi army was coming to kill or subjugate them all again, and some Hutu began to kill Tutsi.\n\nWell, that and the fact that the Hutu leadership were blaring anti-Tutsi propaganda similar to this and much worse at them through every medium available. Garrison unquestioningly accepts the Hutu Power narrative again. In any ethnic war, the leadership of side claims everyone of the “enemy” ethnic group is coming to kill/enslave/etc them. This isn’t a justification for killing – it’s just racism.\n\n&gt; EH: There’s no evidence of these genocidal plans, and the Hutu would have won the upcoming election.  The election was foreclosed by the assassination and conquest by Kagame.\n\nWhat do you mean, “the Hutu” would have won the election? Rwanda, by this point, had several political parties, some of which were not explicitly Hutu or Tutsi. It’s quite possible moderate Hutu parties might have gone into coalition with the RPF. Indeed, that’s one interpretation of what caused the Rwandan genocide – a desperate measure by Hutu extremists to prevent an alliance (or at least, understanding) between Tutsis and moderate Hutus that would have forced the extremists from power. The Arusha Accords were implicitly (only explicitly in the transitional period) about power-sharing. Thus, in theory, the RPF would be no more trying to “win” the election than Sinn Fein attempt to “win” Northern Irish elections.\n\n&gt; But we don’t have to speculate about this. The Rwanda tribunal actually carried out an investigation of who shot the plane down back in 1996 and 1997.  They appointed a 20-man group to carry out this study. These investigators hired by the tribunal  came up with a report in 1996, based on what they thought to be credible witness testimony by members of the RPF, that Kagame had planned the assassin when the tribunal found that theation and carried it out. When this report was presented to the prosecutor of the tribunal, she consulted the United States and then canceled the investigation. And, from 1996 to the present, although the shoot-down of this plane is widely thought to be the event that triggered the genocide, the tribunal hasn’t looked into it and the U.N. hasn’t looked into it beyond that. These investigators hired by the Rwanda tribunal produced a report, in 1996, based on what they thought was credible witness testimony by members of the RPF, that Kagame had planned the assassination and carried it out. When this report was presented to the prosecutor of the tribunal, she consulted the United States and then canceled the investigation.\n\nIronically, this point that Herman is so obsessed with is actually the one that least goes against scholarly views. While it’s far from being an accepted position, many reputable scholars have posited the idea that the RPF shot Habyarimana’s plane down. Michael Mann, for instance, in his excellent and respected work on genocide *The Dark Side of Democracy*, argues that it was probably the RPF that shot it down.\n\n&gt; AG: And even, whether you believe the evidence or not, Paul Kagame and his forces were the only ones who stood to gain by Habyarimana’s assassination and what happened afterwards, right? Otherwise they would have lost to Habyarimana and his party in the next year’s election.\n&gt; EH: Yes, he’s the only gainer from it.\n\nWell, apart from this election assumption which I’ve already been through, this is all assuming that the RPF would *win* the war, something that was far from certain. They’d failed to defeat the Rwandan Army (FAR) since 1990, what had suddenly changed now? The factors that gave the RPF the decisive advantage were genocide-related ones – the loss of French support to the Hutu government and, most importantly, the fact that the FAR were spending huge chunks of resources, time and effort on hunting and killing Tutsis rather than fighting the RPF.\n\nThis is a gaping hole in the deniers’ argument. They make huge claims and implications about the RPF’s military superiority – indeed, elsewhere Herman portrays the FAR as utterly useless and incompetent – yet cannot explain why this supposed clear RPF superiority led to a stalemate from 1990-93.\n\n&gt; AG: OK, let’s move on to Chapter Four: “Rwandan genocide by the numbers.” When Professor Allan Stam wrote to a U.N. official to ask how he estimated that the dead in Rwanda were 500,000, the U.N. official responded that he couldn’t quite remember, but they knew they needed a really big number.\n\nAllan Stam is an odd character who will come up again. He and his regular collaborator Christian Davenport are not deniers as such – they fully accept that a genocide was committed against Tutsis by Hutu Power forces. However, they do hold unwarrantedly revisionist and bizarre views on the genocide that leads to their work being mined by denialists. For example, Stam and Davenport are convinced (due to a misinterpretation of sources) that the *Interahamwe* and other paramilitaries embarked not on a specifically anti-Tutsi genocidal campaign, but on an indiscriminate bloodbath of anyone, Hutu or Tutsi. This is a long-winded way of saying a likely distorted anecdote from a figure who is not an entirely reputable source himself is not something I’m inclined to accept as evidence.\n\n&gt; The numbers that eventually came to be most widely accepted were that 800,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi and a few Hutu moderates who tried to protect them died at the hands of Hutu extremists. Why is this impossible?\n\nNo, the accepted range is 500,000-1,000,000, with 800,000 being the most accepted number. This may seem pedantic, and to most people I’d just chalk this up as a small and inconsequential mistake, but for the deniers it serves their purposes to exaggerate the accepted estimates.\n\n&gt; EH: It’s impossible because the number of Tutsi in Rwanda, back in 1994, was way under 800,000. In fact, the best figure one could come up with in those early years was based on the census, the Rwandan census of 1991, which gave the Tutsi numbers at about 590,000. So if all of them were wiped out, it wouldn’t come anywhere near 800,000. But all of them weren’t wiped out. After the war, the best estimate, which was by a Tutsi survivors’ group, was that there were 400,000 Tutsi still there. So let’s say there were 600,000 beforehand and afterwards there were 400,000, that means 200,000 dead Tutsi. If there were 800,000 killed and 200,000 of them were Tutsi, 600,000 of them must have been Hutu. If it was a million, 800,000 of them must have been Hutu.\n\nRwanda deniers absolutely bet everything on the 1991 Census. It’s their only piece of actual hard evidence that appears at first sight to contradict accepted accounts, rather than highly circumstantial information or distorted sources. But it’s been widely accepted that the census systematically undercounted Tutsis and overcounted Hutus. Both because local governments tried to overplay the number of Hutus in their areas to get more money from the pro-Hutu government, and because Tutsis often tried to pass as Hutus. The Rwandan government itself acknowledged the latter problem when it gave a report on the census in 1994, just prior to the genocide, and concluded that Tutsis were being undercounted. Gerard Prunier, who analysed the 1991 census with these issues in mind, concluded that the Tutsi population on the eve of the genocide was in fact 930,000.\n\nAs for 400,000 survivors. Well, for a start, Herman is not consistent on this number. [Elsewhere]( http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/hp140810.html) he cites what appears to be the same source as 300,000 survivors. But what’s 100,000 people between friends, right? Besides which, Herman gives no reason why either this or the census figure are the best estimates. OK, I suppose a non-expert might just assume a census to be reliable. A survivors’ organisation, on the other hand, has no special significance. Maybe its estimate is a proper, scholarly one, but if so then give me a reason why it is more accurate than other scholarly estimates – to give just a couple of examples, Prunier estimates 130,000 survivors, while Alison Des Forges gives 150,000 as an estimate. There are plenty of reasons a survivors organisation might exaggerate the number or survivors – to win more government funding, more international charity, more compensation in a damages suit, etc.\n\n&gt; And it’s completely logical that the Hutu were the greatest victims by number, because this was an invasion by a Tutsi army.\n\nSo now they’re a Tutsi army, co-ethnics with the Tutsi civilians killed, rather than a foreign Ugandan army?\n\n&gt; I conclude, as do Christian Davenport and Allan Stam, who did a very careful study of the killings in 1994, that many more Hutu were killed than Tutsi.\n\nNo mention that Davenport and Stam also concluded that the killers were overwhelmingly Hutus, not the RPF.\n\n&gt; AG: OK, and because this is a very sensitive subject, I want to add that this was a tragedy for everyone in Rwanda. Hutus and Tutsis died. Now let’s move on to Chapter Five, “The West’s alleged ‘failure to intervene.’” The story of the West’s failure to intervene to stop the Rwandan genocide has become the starting point of all the campaigns to go to war to “stop the next Rwanda.” What’s wrong with this story?\n&gt; EH: What’s wrong with it is that the West was intervening from the very beginning. The West supported Kagame’s invasion in 1990. He was trained at Fort Leavenworth.\n\nKagame trained at Fort Leavenworth (for a few weeks on a course he never finished, but Herman doesn’t mention that), ergo he was always a total American puppet. Well by that logic I’m concluding that the Milosevic-allied Yugoslav Army in the Croatian and Slovenian Wars was also an American puppet, as it was commanded by the Fort Leavenworth-trained General Veljko Kadijević.\n\n&gt; Just before the shoot down of the plane on April 6, 1994, the United States caused the U.N. to withdraw some of its troops. That was an intervention.\n\nYou heard it here first, folks – the US ‘intervened’ by *withdrawing troops.*\n\nThis is something that permeates throughout Herman’s work, both on Rwanda and Yugoslavia. He attacks accounts that describe “intervention” as coming late or not at all, and he claims it came earlier. It doesn’t even seem to occur to him that they are talking specifically about military or at least peacekeeping interventions, while he broadens the term to just about anything he doesn’t like. In his writings in Yugoslavia, for example, he repeatedly misquotes David Owen to portray him as annoyed by US meddling and involvement in the peace process, when Owen was actually merely annoyed by US *vagueness and ambiguity* in the peace process.\n\n&gt; After the shoot down and the mass killings really started, the government of Rwanda called repeatedly for a ceasefire repeatedly, but Kagame did not want it because he knew he could win. And therefore the United States did not support any ceasefire and it recognized Kagame’s government after three more months of war.\n\nPrudence Bushnell, the main State Department official following the events in Rwanda (I think her official role was Deputy Secretary of State for Africa, or something like that), called Kagame a few times to try to persuade him to wait rather than continue with an offensive, as did UNAMIR commander Romeo Dallaire – both believed (wrongly, as it turned out) that they could persuade Clinton to endorse and intervention force. As for recognition, that’s what the world generally does – it recognises the government in power. This is particularly true for Africa. There’s plenty of reason to criticise that practice, but it’s not unique to Rwanda.\n\n&gt; AG: I think that really needs emphasis. People have been led to believe that the massacres began and Paul Kagame and his army moved to stop them. What actually happened was that the massacres began and Paul Kagame resumed the war to win, at all costs.\n\nKind of hard to know that for sure. Did Kagame respond to the massacres, or did he plan to attack regardless of them? Frankly, does it matter that much?\n\n&gt; EH: Yes, that’s true. In fact one could say that all the dead people were collateral damage. The aim of the United States was to support Kagame’s takeover, and if vast numbers of people were killed, it was a cost that we were prepared to accept. But it doesn’t look good, so we have to say that we failed to intervene; we failed to stop it. Well, in fact, we not only failed to stop it, we actually supported the mass killing. One could say that all the dead people were collateral damage. The aim of the United States was to support Kagame’s takeover, and if vast numbers of people were killed, it was a cost that we were prepared to accept. We not only failed to stop it, we actually supported the mass killing.\n\n&gt; AG: Yes, Professor Allan Stam has reported that the Pentagon estimated collateral damage of 250,000 people, a quarter of a million. It turned out to be closer to a million.\n&gt; EH: I can believe it.\n\nBullshit to the *n*th degree. Brutal as Kagame was, there’s no way he could have inflicted 250,000 (let along a million) deaths just by collateral damage. I don’t think they realise it, but Garrison and Herman are essentially positing that this was the worst war in terms of the civilian casualty ratio of all time by a long way. So you know, World War II had a civilian:combatant casualty ratio of about 2:1. Particularly brutal wars see that go up to 4 or 5 to 1. The First Chechen War, considered one of the most astonishingly bad wars for civilian casualties in the modern era, reached 10:1 according to some estimates. The RPF and FAR combined lost about 10,000 men in the 1994 RPF offensive – a ratio of 25:1 at least if we accept the 250,000 figure they give here. You don’t kill half a million people just on military indifference, or even emotional bloodlust – it takes deliberation and planning.\n\n&gt; AG: And that was Rwandan gospel singer Kizito Muhigo, a Rwandan Tutsi who is now serving 10 years in a Rwandan prison for singing those lyrics for both Hutu and Tutsi who died in the Rwandan massacres.\n\nMuhigo is also a genocide survivor who, needless to say, does not endorse anything like Herman and Garrison’s views. The fact that one can both accept the reality of the genocide and be a strong opponent of the Kagame regime weakens the deniers’ argument rather than strengthening it.\n\n&gt; It did deliver victor’s justice. The first part of that statement is therefore correct. That it was a great triumph of international justice is a complete fallacy because victor’s justice is not international justice. Victor’s justice is a kind of revenge and, in fact, the ICTR served as a virtual arm of Kagame and the Rwandan state. It went after only Hutu, although, as I pointed out a while ago, the majority of killings were killings of Hutu in Rwanda. But of course the RPF could not be brought to trial.\n\nNuremberg also only tried the defeated, you may recall. But it is a fair criticism to make of ICTR that it only tries Hutu Power figures, rather than also RPF figures guilty of atrocities. That said, I doubt Herman would be any happier if ICTR did try RPF figures as well – he has no respect for ICTY in Yugoslavia, for example, despite the fact that it has tried and convicted Croats, Bosniaks and Kosovans as well as Serbs.\n\nAlso, even if more Hutus had been killed, that would not by any stretch automatically mean that killers were not also mostly Hutu – indeed, the authors Herman depends on to conclude that more Hutu were killed – Davenport and Stam – do conclude that the killers were overwhelmingly Hutu.\n&gt; EH: Actually, the belief that there was a conspiracy to commit genocide is swallowed by the ICTR, by Human Rights Watch and many, many commentators. But the tribunal itself, when it had to come to grips with this, couldn’t find any such conspiracy. They did believe that there was a genocide, and certainly there was mass killing, but a conspiracy to commit genocide would have had to take place before the shoot-down of the plane on April 6, 1994. And so when high level people in the Hutu government were brought to trial and there was an attempt to find that they actually had a plan, the tribunal couldn’t find it. In this book, we studied 15 top trials where the prosecution attempted to prove a conspiracy to commit genocide, and in all 15 the tribunal found that there was no evidence for a conspiracy. There was killing, which they called genocide, but they could not find any pre-April 6, 1994, plan to commit genocide. So they rejected this argument, but the defenders and apologists for Kagame continue to talk about this conspiracy to commit genocide.\n\nI’m not well-versed enough in ICTR verdicts to properly address this, though I have read others claim that Herman distorts the meaning of verdicts. I would raise a couple of points, however. Firstly, the lack of a pre-existing detailed plan is perfectly consistent with a functionalist view of the genocide. Secondly, he’s confusing legal burdens of proof with historical method. A court cannot judge someone guilty simply on what evidence suggests *probably* happened, they need to be certain. A historian can (and indeed, often should) make such judgements.\n\n&gt; AG: Now, Chapter Nine: “Africa’s World War: Kagame’s alleged pursuit of ‘genocidaires’ in Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the death of millions.” What’s wrong with Kagame’s claim that his troops and proxy militias were in DR Congo for nearly 20 years to hunt down the Hutu genocidaires guilty of killing Rwanda’s Tutsi in 1994?\n&gt; EH: Well, one problem is there were no “genocidaires.” There were members of the Rwandan army that had been beaten and dispersed, but they were not genocidaires. That’s baloney. And he knows who did the killing, that he himself with his forces did most of the killing. But also, the army that was in the Congo, the old Hutu army, was no longer a real force. It had been defeated and these people had been dispersed in the Congo. They did not constitute a real threat to Rwanda.\n\nWell, of course Herman believes there were no genocidaires, as he believes there was no genocide. But did the Hutu Power forces in eastern Congo pose a threat to Rwanda? Well, that’s debatable, and depends what exactly you think constitutes a threat. Did they stand any chance of taking over Rwanda in an invasion? Almost certainly not. Could they potentially enter western Rwanda and cause a decent bit of chaos, death and damage? Probably. They certainly weren’t the hopeless disparate crowd that Herman makes them out to be – they had formed armed and organised paramilitaries. The Hutu refugees in Congo were, in comparison to most refugee populations, very organised and regimented – Hutu Power forces maintained considerable control over them.\n\nIt’s almost certainly true that wanting to loot eastern Congo played a part in Kagame’s decision to go in, I don’t deny that.\n\n&gt; EH: Well, the United States has been the superpower that has dominated what has happened in this area in the Congo and in Rwanda. The American people know almost nothing about the area, and since the United States has had a strong position of support for Kagame and for the invasion of the Congo, that dominated all the institutions that were associated with it. The U.N. – most of its reports – were really supportive of the invasion. They swallowed the conspiracy to commit genocide line. They provided the tribunal. It’s true that they did have some reports, like these reports I mentioned, that talked about mass killing in the Congo, but they couldn’t avoid that because this was such an enormous volume of killing, and there were millions of refugees. So the U.N. had to confront it, and they had to speak a certain amount of truth. But essentially, the U.N. supported the U.S. position. And even during the Rwanda crisis in 1994, the U.N. did nothing when Kagame put a lot of military people right in Kigali. They let him get away with it. The human rights groups also did poorly. Human Rights Watch was an outrage from the beginning, following the standard line. And the media, moving forward to April 2014, and the 20th anniversary of the 1994 massacres, have supported the Western propaganda line.  When that anniversary made headlines, the bias of the mainstream media was dramatic. Thus 20 advocates for the standard model were given ten times as many bylined articles ad distinguished dissenters from that model; most of the dissenting experts couldn’t get into the mainstream media at all. And particularly terrible were the U.S. and British media. Of the 20 dissenters from the standard model, there were a grand total of 17 articles, and most of them were in France. And most of these experts that were dissenters could never get into the mainstream media at all. And particularly terrible were the U.S. and British media.\n\nAgain, it’s the “I’m right and everyone else is wrong” hubris. Creationists and Holocaust deniers also get less space in decent media than experts on evolution and the Holocaust. The reason the “dissenters” get so little space is because they have such low scholarly standards, and many of them have brazenly apparent vested interests in being biased – at least two of the figures Herman cites as “dissenters”, Christopher Black and Peter Erlinder, are defence lawyers at ICTR, and a third, Robin Philpot, is the brother of another. The figure who accounts for the vast bulk of media space (9 of 17 articles – no-one else has more than 2) on his “dissenters” list is Pierre Pean, who I suspect gets more space due to being a particularly despicable denier; unlike the others, who don’t appear to have any anti-Tutsi attitudes (they’re largely just contrarians for the sake of it, or else have a vested interest in denial), Pean routinely voices astonishing racism against Tutsis. And I don’t mean the RPF, I mean he’s claimed that all Tutsis are inherently deceivers and liars by virtue of being Tutsi, among other things (which include adapting traditional anti-Semitic tropes to the Tutsis).\n\nAlso, he conflates in his “advocates” list (people who accept the facts of the genocide) people who are indeed experts on the topic, such as Gerald Caplan, Linda Melvern, and Philip Gourevitch, with people who have zero specialist knowledge of it, like Daniel Goldhagen (who has limited scholarly credibility in the only relevant field he has some expertise in, the Holocaust) and Tony Blair (who, at the time of the genocide, was not UK Prime Minister or even leader of the Labour Party, but merely Shadow Home Secretary).\n\n&gt; EH: Well, one very important similarity is that the United States and its allies are trying for regime change in Burundi, just as they did in Rwanda. They wanted to get rid of the Habyarimana government, a social democratic government in Rwanda. They don’t like the social democratic government in Burundi and they’re trying to get rid of it. Another thing is that they’re talking of intervention here based on the fact that the head of state of Burundi has taken a third term, which is contested on a constitutional basis. And it’s ridiculous that the great powers should be upset about a third term, when they’re supporting Kagame, who is a dictator and who has his chief contestant, Victoire Ingabire, in jail and claims to get 93 percent of the vote.\n\nSo Kagame is a dictator because he claims to get 93% of the vote in elections. That’s a fair argument, and I agree with it. Kagame is a dictator, and his elections are fraudulent. But funnily enough, Herman doesn’t apply this logic to his Hutu predecessor Habyarimana, who Herman trumpets as a social democrat. He supposedly won three elections, in 1978, 1983 and 1988. His claimed results in those elections? 98.99%, 99.97% and 99.98% respectively. But no doubt Herman will claim he was just really popular. Pierre Nkurunziza, the Burundian President who he claims leads a “wonderful democracy”, allegedly won 92% of the vote in 2010.\n\n&gt; EH: Well, what I’d like to say is that this issue on Rwanda and the struggles there and the work of the ICTR, it’s a very complicated issue, so I would urge people to get this book that we put out, which has a lot of detail. But there are also some other really excellent books on the work of the ICTR and other international courts. There’s a very good book called “Justice Belied: The Unbalanced Scales of International Criminal Justice,” and it’s an anthology edited by Sébastien Chartrand and John Philpot. “Justice Belied” – it’s a critical work on the workings of the international justice system. And many of the writers are very familiar with Rwanda and the issues in Africa and it’s even argued by some of the writers that the international justice system, as it’s now working, is really an arm of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nSo apparently, these authors are all “very familiar with Rwanda”, which qualifies them to write on it. Interestingly, this apparently doesn’t apply to those they disagree with. Romeo Dallaire, despite living through the genocide as commander of the UN forces, knows nothing about it according to Herman. Alison Des Forges, who received a PhD from Yale in Rwandan history and was considered the world-leading expert on Rwanda at the time, as well as being fluent in Kinyarwanda (a skill whose holders in the Western world could probably be counted on one hand at the time), knows nothing about the country because she worked for the State Department one time. Philippe Gaillard, the head of the Red Cross staff in Rwanda in 1994, who lived in Rwanda all through the genocide, knows nothing about the country. The arrogance is astonishing.\n\nThis is why it’s impossible to convince deniers. Everyone who disagrees with them becomes the “establishment”, which they can then dismiss purely for that reason.\n",

        "text": "So I've recently been reading *Shōgun* by James Clavell, telling the story of the first Englishman to Japan and his experiences getting caught up in Japanese power struggles. Great read and it scratches that itch I have for bringing historical eras to vivid life through a character-driven narrative. And while I understand it to present a pretty well-researched image of 1600 Japan, there are of course some things it over-exaggerates like just how willing everyone is to die at a moments notice. But none of that bugged me, except for one inaccuracy that stuck out to me.\n\n\nThe guns.\n\n\nThe Europeans are often described as carrying pistols around, which made me wonder what sort of pistols would be carried in 1600. Ah, wheellocks of course. Until they described the drawing back of the hammer, which discounts that idea. So, snaplocks? Maybe? I pretended that was the case and carried on, until a point in the book is reached where (SPOILER FOR A FORTY YEAR OLD BOOK) the English character is helping a local daimyo train Japanese musketeers with a plot-important shipment of Portuguese muskets. Muskets, not arquebuses -another inaccuracy that caught me- and its made flatly clear that we're talking flintlock muskets here -socket bayonets included- which is an irritating anachronism placing guns into a setting around eighty years too early. The Japanese would have been using matchlocks like [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Antique_Japanese_%28samurai%29_tanegashima_rack.jpg), not flintlocks. \n\n\nIs this a petty complaint? Yes. Is it pettier than the inaccuracies of Japanese culture (especially the Samurai) and the political situation around the time of 1600? Probably. But goddamn if that didn't just take me out of the story for awhile.\n\n\nAnd to rub salt into that pedantic wound, the tactics the Englishman taught the Japanese tactics that wouldn't exist for over half a century, organizing the samurai into long lines of ranks for volley fire, instead of the only tactics he would have known to use, namely a Spanish *tercio.* So, wrong guns and wrong tactics for the time.\n\n\nGood book anyway though. So comrades, what pedantic mistakes really throw you out of the saddle of a historical fiction?",

        "text": "This weekend has been one in which I have devoted myself principally to cleaning and gardening, but since I have some free time I thought it appropriate for another Badhistory documentary review. Today I have chosen Conquest - Weapons of the Barbarians:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdHG9XHWHgo\n\nThis episode is again written and produced by Peter Woodward, who I have officially declared my arch-enemy. I have already pointed out how Germanic and Celtic peoples could not be considered barbarians in my previous reviews, so I am not going to address such references in this episode. Nonetheless, given the theme is barbarian peoples, I have chosen an imaginary drink originating from the most violence and savage culture that has ever been unleashed to torment those upon this Earth: Canadian Club. Likewise, as in most documentaries, early Imperial Roman soldiers with lorica segmentata are depicted, even though a lot of the subject matter covers the Republican period, so there is no point in me constantly pointing out that error. Now let us descend into the bowels of inaccuracy!\n\n1.01: The host states that barbarians peoples migrated into Europe over the centuries. He is talking about the various Celtic, Germanic, Iberian and Thracian cultures. The problem with this assertion is that such civilizations developed *within* Europe, not outside of it. For example, the Celts originated from the Hallstatt Culture from southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland,  whilst the Germanic peoples came from northern Germany, Denmark and Scandinavia. DRINK!\n\n1.30: The host says the term \"barbarian\" came from the Sanskrit word for stammering. Holy Mother Tongue! jokes aside, the modern word is actually from ancient Greek - \"barbaros\", which has generally been interpreted to mean something or someone foreign or alien. The Greek term is etymologically descended from an old Indo-European word (not Sanskrit) but it was transmitted to the rest of Europe through Greek usage, context and pronunciation. DRINK!\n\n1.49: The host states the barbarian peoples considered their cultures superior to the violent and decadent culture of Rome. This is blatantly wrong as we have no surviving records written by the ancient Celts or Germans. Everything we know about them either comes from Roman/Greek writers or through the archaeological record. We don't know what they thought of Rome. DRINK!\n\n1.57: The host states that the Barbarian peoples always seemed to lose their wars with Rome. I wonder what Brennus thinks of this? Wait, I can't ask him. He's too busy sleeping on a bed made from all the gold he received from his successful sacking of Rome. DRINK!\n\n2.24: The host calls the Celtic sword a long-sword. The longsword was actually longer than the typical Celtic sword, with a grip that allowed it to be used two-handed (it was also called a hand-and-a-half sword). The Celtic sword was not a longsword at all, but equivalent to the later medieval arming sword. DRINK!\n\n2.29: GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! The idiot host asserts that most of the Celts did not have armour because the Celtic sword required strength and flexibility to use. Celtic maille in no way inhibited a warrior from using his sword. Most Celts did not have armour because it was expensive to make. DRINK!\n \n2.48: The host holds up what he claims is a javelin. I don't know what the f#ck that weapon is, but it is certainly not a javelin. It is much too large, heavy and the head does not look like anything from the time-period I have seen. DRINK!\n\n3.04: The host states Rome was sacked in 400 BC. It took place around ten years later, 390 BC. Has this guy even done the smallest bit of research? DRINK!\n\n3.10: The host says the Romans destroyed Gallic civilization. Absolutely incorrect. Gallic civilization continued on after the Roman conquest. In fact, the Gaulish language continued be spoken well after 400 AD. DRINK!\n\n3.55: The host states the Celt-Iberians had a sword called the gladius. Yeah, no. The term gladius was *originally Celtic*, but used a hard 'k', not a g. It was the Romans who pronounced it as 'gladius', and was intended to describe ALL swords, not just the weapon which was adopted from the Celt-Iberians. The particular design being shown is different to the original Celt-Iberian type, which was more leaf-shaped. DRINK!\n\n4.03: The host says the spear being shown was made entirely of iron. Meanwhile, half the weapon is made from wood. DRINK!\n\n4.07: The host states it was the Celt-Iberians who invented maille. The Romans wrote it was the Celts of central and western Europe that invented it, not the Celts in Spain. DRINK!\n\n5.18: The host states the Germans used a seax. The problem is he seems to be talking about the early German from the 1st century BC onwards, whilst the seax dates from the Migration Period, 300 Ad onwards. DRINK!\n\n5.14: The host explains that the Germanic peoples used the broad-axe. The weapon he is referring to seems to be of the two-handed Viking variety, seen here:\n\nhttp://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_axe.htm\n\nThis type of weapon was absolutely not used by the early Germanic peoples, nor was it common in the Migration Period. The weapon is so anachronistic the host would be better off asserting that the Germans advanced on Rome after being deployed from Cylon Base-stars. DRINK! \n\n5.27: The host states the early Germans used the francisa. This weapon did not appear until the after 300 AD. DRINK!\n\n5.35: The axe the individual is throwing is clearly from the late medieval era, around the 15th century AD, as it has similar design elements to this war-hammer:\n\nhttp://myarmoury.com/review_aa_wham.html\n\nAgain, the presence of Cylons would be more historically plausible. DRINK!\n\n5.38: The host says the throwing axe was useless against a shield and was not meant to be thrown against them. Meanwhile, Procopius stated the francisca was highly effective against shields, being able to shatter them. Can the host even f#cking-well read? DRINK!\n\n6.16: The host states they have four types of barbarians, including the Celts and Gauls. You know, who were the same FREAKING PEOPLE! DRINK!\n\n6.38: The host explains that the barbarians really only had one type of tactic: the frontal charge. This is hilarious as he mentioned that the Celt-Iberians used guerrilla tactics earlier in the *same damn episode*. The British Celts were adept at skirmishing from chariots, the Gallic peoples under Vercingetorix launched many ambushes, and Caesar describes the Celts and Germans as forming phalanxes, or defensive formations. DRINK!\n\n6.43: The host says that the idea of the barbarian charge was to run in so Roman javelins had little effect. The problem here is that the Romans usually threw their javelins as prelude to a charge themselves. When defending they would form a shield-wall to resist a charge, and I believe this would preclude the use of a javelin as they would need to remain stationary to better receive an assault. DRINK!\n\n7.23: The host says the barbarian charge hardly ever worked. The problem with this is that, since the host asserted that the charge was the primary tactic, that means in the following barbarian victories:\n\nBattle of the Allia - 390 BC\n\nBattle of Arretium - 283 BC\n\nBattle of Faesulae - 225 BC\n\nBattle of Noreia - 112 BC\n\nBattle of Burdigala - 107 BC\n\nBattle of Arausio - 105 BC\n\nBattle of Gergovia - 52 BC\n\nImplies the barbarian charge must have worked pretty damn well given the fact the Romans were defeated. DRINK!\n\n7.51: The host is disturbingly obsessed with javelins.\n\n7.55: The host says the Romans were too disciplined to break ranks. Except they often did, such as during the wars against Viriathus in Spain where many forces were tricked into pursuit and massacred. DRINK!\n\n8.08: Legionnaire of Doom is an awesome band name.\n\n8.24: The host states that that heavy infantry had two weaknesses: cavalry and missiles weapons. This is amusing because heavy infantry were very effective at resisting cavalry by forming a phalanx, and their shields ensured good protection against missile fire. DRINK!\n\n9.09: A barbarian is wielding a spear with wings, which appeared only with the Vikings and Carolingian Franks from 750 AD onwards. DRINK!\n\n10.22: The host claims that the Romans could chop their way through spears. False. Shafts were quite thick and it was very hard to slice through it with a sword, especially as the spear itself would move back under a strike since it was not fixed rigidly, reducing much of the force and cutting power. DRINK!\n\n10.26: The host states most barbarians fought as individuals. Except for all those times they formed close-order defensive formations. DRINK!\n\n10.38: GAH! GAAAAAAH! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! The host claims the spear could only be used effectively with two hands, and so the shield had to be given up. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Christopher Matthew in his book, A Storm of Spears, established that a spear is perfectly lethal and agile when used in one hand. And given that the shield was the *primary defensive armour used by all warriors of the period*, there is absolutely *no way in all the various layers of hell and alternate dimensions* that any barbarian would willingly abandon one. FINISH THE F#CKING BOTTLE AND GET ANOTHER ONE. DRINK!\n\n10.50: Another claim that body armour just slowed barbarians down and so would not be used. DRINK!\n\n11.20: The host is showing us how to fight a Roman, and is happily assuming the Roman is just going to fight him one on one at a distance rather than just forming a shield-wall with his buddies or rushing in, using his shield to knock the spear aside and then stabbing him in the face. Also, since he threw away his shield, I would expect the host to have five pilum protruding from his torso right now. DRINK!\n\n11.31: I am sorry, but there is no way a spear would just break like that from a sword strike. The wonderful Thegn Thrand had a video showing how hard it is to cut a spear like that (older video, please excuse the sound):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AStYHlaEOg\n\nDrink!\n\n12.27: \"You may have two stabs with it before a Roman is on top of you\". Hehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n11.13: How do you accurately represent ancient warfare? Just get a bunch of noobs and have them shoot arrows at bales of hay!\n\n13.53: What is the material of these bows? How does their poundage compare to war-bows from the ancient period?\n\n14.05: The host states the barbarians used various kinds of cutting weapons in close-combat. Completely incorrect. The spear was the most common close-combat. DRINK!\n\n14.06: Another Celtic sword = long-sword reference. DRINK!\n\n14.13: Host spins a sword around like a LARPER having an epileptic fit. \n\n14.55: VIKING AXE AGAIN! DRINK!\n\n15.46: The host shows a caetra made out of metal. The Celt-Iberian caetra was never made completely of metal, but rather wood with a metal boss. DRINK!\n\n17.17: The soldier of the late Roman army is still using a classic Imperial scutum, when they had transitioned to a more oval design. DRINK!\n\n17.21: The host calls a spatha a long-sword. Again, completely different types of weapons. DRINK!\n\n18.45: Still a better fight scene than the 4th season of Arrow.\n\nSources\n\nThe Ancient Celts, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nThe Complete Roman Army, by Adrian Goldsworthy\n\nRome and the Sword: How Warriors and Weapons Shaped Roman History, by Simon James\n\nA Storm of Spears: Understanding the Greek Hoplite at War, by Christopher Matthew\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West, by Guy Halsall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "First submission and admittedly a low hanging fruit the siege of pairs in season three of Vikings.\n\nThere is sizable wad of bad history in the episodes that deal with the 845 siege of Paris looking at you widespread use of crossbow in early middle ages that didn't happen until till the 11th century. To be honest that's not thing that really irks me. It's the goddamn use of the Oriflamme in 845 in a Carolingian kingdom. The banner existed when it was used in battle it symbolized ferocity, blood-lust and most importantly that no quarter was to be given which was a big scare for the nobility of high and later periods of medieval age. In which many were assured relative safety if captured through lucrative ransoms. A problem with its use was that it was used first by Louis IV 1124 nearly 280 years after this siege takes place. Now normally I'd get using an iconic military relic out of time anachronistically if there was nothing on hand but there is so many other options! This is the period in which the Carolingian's expanded the Merovingian cult of military relics, by the 8th century the clergy were excluded from military expeditions with exception of carrying the relics and as such were regularly used as standard bearers. By the time of Charles the Bald (who was the king of Paris at the time of the siege) Frankish kings had adopted the Byzantine tradition of leading the troops to battle behind a cruciform war ensign. Why couldn't they of used the cloak or banner of St Martin? First carried into battle by the Frankish kings in 699 as means of securing victory and used to secure oaths from vassals. Hell the clergy responsible for the relic were called cappellanu which is sort of the root word of which military chaplains come from. The Carolingian is so rarely shown in pop drama why did they have to go and mess it up. \nSources\nEternal Victory: Triumphal Rulership in Late Antiquity, Byzantium and the Early Medieval West by Michael McCormick\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriflamme\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_of_Tours",

        "text": "Today, during a lesson on how to perform historic dances for the stage, we were regaled with some of the most... interesting facts I had ever heard about Elizabethan fashion and culture. Some standout 'facts' were:\n\nAll upper class women were forced to wear solid wooden front and backboards, in the manner of a training corset, from the moment of their first steps to the time of their death. (There was such a thing as a busk, a kind of hard front for a bodice made out of wood, bone, metal, etc. but they were specifically designed to be removable even while wearing the dress.)\n\nElizabethan Britons were the inventors of the fork. (Fork was likely Greek or Roman invention, but definitely in use by Byzantines by the 4th Century. Hilariously, not only did the English of that time not invent forks, they didn't use them either. Eating with your hands/ your dagger only fell out of fashion in the 18th century.)\n\nThe English of this time period were the first humans on Earth to make use of coinage and banking. (In Europe, coins go back to at least the early 6th century BCE via the Greeks, and banking likely nearly as far.)\n\nAnd, my favorite, that all women of a certain status had their floating ribs surgically removed.\n(The wasp-waisted ideal of feminine beauty that removing ribs would help fit didn't come into fashion until ~300 years later, and also; it was the 16th century! They were incapable of doing even basic surgeries, let alone extremely dangerous cosmetic ones. If that had been the case then the female half of the British upper class would have been extinct within 5 years.",

        "text": "I'm sure many of you have seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOmjnioNulo), which is CGP Grey's most recent production which touts the thesis of the pop history book *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. His offenses in this video aren't quite as bad as that one, and normally I wouldn't even have noticed that the video contains badhistory (I am, at best, an armchair historian), but it just so happens that I have recently read some very specific material on the subject.\n\nThe problem is not so much that Grey gets his facts *wrong* (except that, well, he does to some extent), but rather that he completely misses the point. The question he is attempting to answer in his video is \"Why weren't zebras domesticated even though horses were?\" The issue here is that it completely overlooks the question of \"Why were horses domesticated?\" As Grey himself states, domesticated animals are vastly different from their wild ancestors. Horses are no exception, and the steps that led to horse domestication are not quite as clear-cut as one might imagine.\n\nFirst of all, let's start with somewhere where he's just flat-out wrong. (Disclaimer: this bit is more BadZoology than BadHistory - skip ahead for the historical bit) He states that horses have a rigid social structure that makes them easy to domesticate, whereas zebras have none. Grey states:\n\n&gt;Zebra lack a family structure ... for Zebra, there's no such thing as society. Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.\n\nIn truth, the two are quite similar. All it took was a quick look at Wikipedia to find:\n\n&gt;The plains zebra is highly social and usually forms small family groups called harems, which consist of a single stallion, several mares, and their recent offspring.\n\nThe cited source is [Estes 1991](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Behavior_Guide_to_African_Mammals.html?id=g977LsZHpcsC), which contains several other segments stating that zebras organize themselves in stallion-mare harems. Compare this to equine social hierarchy:\n\n&gt;The standard feral horse band consists of a stallion with a harem of two to seven mares and their immature offspring. (Anthony 2007)\n\nIn short: zebra and horse social organization are actually remarkably similar, so that can't be the reason that horses were domesticated and zebras not. In fact, Estes states that zebra stallions have been known to form alliances (enabling the famous herds of plains zebras), whereas horse stallions are fiercely competitive. This competition and the stallions' bellicose nature caused the first horse-domesticating societies to start their herds with mares rather than stallions. The domestic mare genetic line can be traced back to almost eighty individuals, whereas the male genetic line only to one.\n\nSo why were horses domesticated? As Anthony states in *The Horse, the Wheel, and Language*, by the time horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppe, cows, sheep, and goats were already domesticated. There was no real reason to domesticate horses for quite some time. Equids were hunted in limited quantities by early Steppe and Anatolian societies, but it was not until around 4800 BCE that they were first domesticated for food. And why *were* they kept for food? The answer lies in their winter grazing habits. Cows, not being the brightest animals, won't go searching for grass under the snow if the grass itself isn't visible. Sheep will dig through soft, shallow snow, but can't break through ice with their noses. Horses, on the other hand, use their hooves to break through the icy layer on top of the snow and get at the grass underneath. They are the lowest-maintenance source of winter meat, which was necessary for the Steppe Societies which began to flourish around this time.\n\nHowever, one very important thing which needs to be mentioned is that *these horses were not originally raised for riding.* This elucidates the problem with Grey's question:\n\n&gt;Why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of Zebra to conquer the world?\n\nNow don't we also have to ask ourselves why they didn't ride out of the Eurasian Steppes on the backs of *horses* until 3000 BCE, millennia after humans had been living in close proximity of horses? As I've stated, the reason is that horses were only kept as food after around 4800 BCE due to an increased demand for winter meat. Horseback riding emerged after this, probably as a method of better controlling domesticated herds, which are typically allowed to roam free rather than being kept in pastures. I won't get into the archaeological evidence that supports this, but essentially we see a definite gap of almost a millenium between the first evidence of domestication and the first evidence of horseback-riding. After this, horseback-riding drastically shifted the balance of power in the prehistoric Eurasian Steppe, and I'm sure I don't need to tell you the huge implications this had for world history.\n\nLong story short: Zebras weren't domesticated because it doesn't snow on the Serengeti.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nSources: Except where otherwise cited, all information is from *The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes shaped the Modern World* by David W.

        "text": "Recently I’ve been watching the sitcom *Community*, which is about students at a community college, because I needed something light-hearted and easy to watch and because a few friends have recommended it before. I've been enjoying it on the whole, but in the last episode I just watched (S4E10) something stopped me right in my tracks and I immediately wrote this post. Basically in this episode the students’ history professor is going to give them a failing grade, so they tie him to a chair and begin to threaten him. In response the professor tries to bribe one of the students into betraying the rest of the group by freeing him.\n\n\nAt this point [12:02] the professor says, “I'm trying to teach you history. Your failure will be the same as any self-obsessed nation: you only care about each other when you're winning. The Romans loved Rome when it was raping half the world, but when Hannibal came charging over the Alps, the Romans turned on themselves as quickly as you can say, \"*e pluribus unum*””.  Now, I'm but a lowly undergrad, but I took some serious issue with this statement, as it makes it clear that the writers had no idea what happened in the Hannibalic War, when it was, *and possibly even who won the conflict*. \n\n\nThe first point I’d make is that Rome didn’t start “raping half the world” as it were, until *after* the Hannibalic War. [If we were to look at a map of Rome at the start of the war in 218BC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Punic_War_II_Battles.PNG), we can see that Rome controlled approximately the boundaries of modern Italy, as well as Corsica. In the decade prior she had conquered the Po Valley in the north of the Italian peninsula, creating the province of Cisalpine Gaul. Rome was a major power, certainly, but it had no real control beyond Italy, so to say she had been “raping half the world” is a gross exaggeration. The other power in the western Mediterranean at the time was, of course, Carthage. At this time Carthage even controlled more territory than Rome, having just conquered much of Iberia, so to pick on Rome for being rapacious seems to ring especially hollow. Come AD117, one can make a much better argument for Rome “raping half the world”, but unfortunately for Dan Harmon, that’s still 300 years adrift from Hannibal. \n\n\nOnto my second point – that the Romans and their allies did not, in fact, turn upon each other.  The crux of Hannibal’s plan was to embarrass the Romans in the field multiple times, making them appear weak and helpless, all so that then the *socii* cities that made up the alliance with Rome (and made up the majority of her legions) would break the alliance and join Carthage in the war. Hannibal certainly ticked the first couple of boxes – he achieved historic victories against the Romans at Trebia (218BC), Trasimene (217BC), and most famously at Cannae (216BC). Rome certainly had been embarrassed and looked helpless – an enormous amount of her manpower had been lost. Yet on the whole the *socii* stuck by Rome and maintained the alliance – the very opposite of what the professor in the episode suggests happened.  To be fair, a number of cities did break away – the Celts in Cisalpine Gaul almost immediately used the opportunity to assert their independence again, many of the Greek cities in the south declared independence, and most importantly Capua declared independence in 216BC (two years after Hannibal crossed the Alps – so not “quickly” at all really). Ultimately though the majority of the *socii* including the most important Latin cities remained with Rome, and Roman manpower did not suffer significantly, while Carthaginian manpower was not sufficiently bolstered to make Hannibal’s campaign successful in the end.\t   \nNow, the second possibility is that the professor was referring not to the Romans in the broad sense of their Italian alliance, but was referring specifically to the Romans themselves. In this case, there was a fair amount of political tension in the city during the initial years of Hannibal’s invasion, principally between those who wanted to take the fight to Hannibal, and between Fabius the Delayer, who would be vindicated in his strategy of denial following Cannae. While there was political conflict, there was never any threat of betrayal, as *Community*’s professor would suggest – the Romans themselves were absolutely united against Carthage, they just quarrelled over how to best achieve it. \n\n\nThe third point, which will be brief, is that it’s implied that the Romans lost the Hannibalic War. The professor’s wording implies that the Romans stopped “winning”, and after this war their reign of “raping half the world” was at an end. Of course this is absurd; the Romans under Scipio Africanus absolutely defeated Carthage and then the Romans went on to ~~rape~~ *spread Roman culture* across the Mediterranean and Europe for centuries to come. Hannibal on the other hand ended up committing suicide on the coast of the Propontis. \n\n\nAll in all, I think this professor was not kicked out of Oxford for having inappropriate relations with co-eds, as *Community* states, but for the rather more heinous crime of having no clue about his field. Anyway, now I've got that out of my system, onto the next episode!\n\n\nSources:   \nLivy, *Ab Urbe Condita*  \n\tPolybius, *The Histories*  \n\tDillon and Garland, *Ancient Rome*",

        "text": "Hello fellow Volcano worshipers, this is my first post here on Bad History so if I mess something up please do tell me. \n\nSome time ago someone made a post asking why no one was making posts and I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3wlf7l/this_subreddit_has_55000_subscribers_it_had_one/cxx6uyj) on it saying that I was planning on doing a write up of some of the historical butchery I encountered in a Humanities class I took last semester. I decided to break up the post I was planning on writing so I can ~~get more karma/upvotes~~ I mean do thorough explanations of each facet of the Bad History. \n\nFirst I want to begin by saying that I know every now and then we get posts by people making fun of the various inaccuracies they’re being taught in college or high school and that in most cases this is simply our way of letting off steam by being super pedantic. I am not that pedantic when it comes to these types of things simply because I simply don’t always feel it's worth it. That being said the stuff that was presented to us as history in this class….it’s just wrong. Straight up wrong. It's not even the type of quack theories or Ancient Aliens kind of wrong its just….wrong. Factually wrong. Just straight up...fucking wrong. \n\nInterested? I thought so, thus I decided to start at the beginning, the ominous beginning. So my fellow Volcano worshipers sit back and take a load off while I begin my tale of torment. \n\nPart 1: You remember Alexander’s famous chariot charge don’t you? Don’t you? \n\nSo, in the beginning it wasn’t so bad.  For the first month or so it was just your usual overgeneralized kind of fare, the type where it’s not really wrong or bad or anything it just suffers from the inaccuracies that arise when trying to quickly condense and run through more than a thousand years of human history. I didn’t care much for how the class was organized or how we were being graded but really it wasn’t too bad and looking back on it I shouldn’t complain. However, one fateful day that all changed…\n\n We were going through the lecture as always and this week we were discussing/reading Aristotle. The main subjects of our lectures was to provide historical context for our readings, as well as very quickly going over the readings themselves. Naturally one cannot discuss Aristotle’s historical context without discussing Philip II and of course, Alexander the Great. Sadly, this is where the horrors begin. \n\nAfter briefly summarizing the Peloponnesian War (boy what a summary that was) the powerpoint slide changed another slide which “explained” the two reasons behind the success of the Macedonian army of Philip II over the Greek coalition. The two given reasons for this success was explained as follows…\n\n1. Longer Spears. \n\n2. “Advanced Chariot Technology”\n\n&gt;[\"Advanced Chariot Technology\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNIeQDP37Nc&amp;index=27&amp;list=PLSSHL9XETepuDohx2_uz8VyUd7eDbbQkE)\n\nNow, let's ignore reason #2 for a second. I assume that “longer spears” is meant to refer to Philip’s introduction of the massive eighteen foot long Sarissa pike to his army instead of the Doru used by the Greeks. Honestly this part isn’t really bad history it's just a really bad oversimplification and that, for this class at least, is pretty harmless and innocent. I will admit however that when I first saw “Longer Spears” as a reason behind Macedon’s victory I chuckled. In my head I imagined a scene wherein Philip II, before his rise to power and restructuring of the Macedonian military, thought back to his days as a boy in the court of Epaminondas and of all the new advancements in warfare he learned there and just said “Why don’t we just take the spears...and make them longer?”. \n\nNo the more egregious reason why this is R5 is the “Advanced Chariot Technology”. Not only were chariots not used by the Macedonian army during this period, they were barely used by any army in Greece during this period. While it is true that chariots were used in Greek warfare, the only real period of time in which the chariot was predominantly used in ancient Greece was during the Bronze Age. The main crux of the style of warfare developed by Philip II and Alexander was based on the use of Cavalry, heavy shock cavalry to be specific. Heavy shock cavalry who charged into the weak points of the engaged enemy line after they had been worn down by skirmishers and were held in place by the heavy infantry. It was perhaps the most defining aspect of Macedonian warfare and one of the reasons why both Philip and Alexander would become some of the most successful generals of their day, if not all time. That and their personal brilliance of course. \n\nI distinctly remember the feeling of horror growing in my stomach when I read that slide. This horror only grew as I turned around to see all my peers around me diligently taking notes on the new slide, totally unaware of the bad history unfolding before their very eyes. I remember this moment well as I had just taken a refreshing sip of water and had the slide changed just a second prior I would have done a spit take. \n\nThat horror turned to anger, not at my fellow classmates but at the class itself as the professor continued on through the slide, trying to explain how the “Longer Spears” and “Advanced Chariot Warfare” used by Philip II and Alexander won the day and put an end to “Greece’s freedoms”. \n\nAt the time I was not happy. I had not particularly been enjoying the class during this time, I was flying through it pretty easily but it wasn’t very engaging or anything. Suddenly it went from being a class I tolerated to a class I actively disliked. \n\nSo through was my rage that I went back to my dorm, booted up photoshop and did the one thing that God put me on this earth to do; I made a dank meme to convey my displeasure.\n\n[Thus here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/NPRnLJZ.jpg?1) \n\nConclusion \n\nLooking back on it, I may not have enjoyed the class that much but it wasn’t really as bad as it seemed at the time. On the bright side it’s given me material to submit to this sub and submit it I shall. I have a feeling it will be therapeutic. \n\nAnd one final note, out of respect and out of common decency I’m not going to reveal the name of the class or the name of the professor. Even though the class may be wrong, I do feel that going onto the internet to ridicule the professor is the wrong course of action. To be honest, I have a decent feeling in my gut that this professor in particular isn’t of a historical background. The nature of the class was to introduce students to the great works up until the Enlightenment (another class deals with that) and so I have a good feeling in my gut that this professor in question is of more of an English background than history. \n\nDoes this excuse not doing basic research? No of course not, but I’d rather a professor be wrong at something that's out of their field than be in the field and be batshit crazy wrong about it. \n\nThat's it for now, I do hope this humble offering pleases the mighty volcano god and you my fellow bad historians. \n\n~~Next time we move on into our discussion of imperial Rome and how the Emperor Vespasian was really a woman. Didn’t know that either? Neither did I!~~\n\nEDIT: I apologize my fellow bad historians, next time we will not be visiting imperial Rome and discussing the femininity of the Emperor Vespasian. No, next time we'll be talking about Republican Rome and an even worse instance of Bad History which I am just now remembering as I seemed to have blocked it from my mind.  \n\nSources: \n\nCavalry Operations in the Ancient Greek World\nBy Robert E.

I'm only quoting the historical relevant bits. The rant goes on for a while into other areas, but we'll get plenty of SJW accusations from this part alone.

I've removed the first part to avoid any more damage.**\n\n**[End Edit - other two edits are just to improve the flow of the remainder of the text]**\n\nLets start with the first historical incorrect statement: \n\n&gt; Rosa parks launched a movement because she wanted to sit in a particular way on a bus. \n\nErhm, a small, but important nuance is that she didn't want to sit in a particular way on a bus, but in a particular **place**. And I don't mean the disabled seat. It's honestly not necessary to rehash the reasons, but I would recommend these past posts by [misterbadidea2](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3d5t38/askreddits_what_myth_do_too_many_people_believe/) and [Cordis_Melum](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1w1x7x/til_that_women_protesting_for_civil_rights_in_the/). The former is more specific about Rosa, the latter one being more about the role of women in the civil rights movement.\n\n&gt; [a man sitting on a bus with his legs open is] called \"manspreading\" and men are told to stop sitting in the way that is natural, dictated by our biology, the way we have been sitting on buses for millions of years. \n\nFirst lets get the callout to /r/Bad_Anatomy^1 out of the way, and then it's time for Bus 101 to the Pleistocene to discuss how this comment is bad public transport history, which stops in Holocene Central, Tarantian City, Ionian Capitol, and terminates in the Calabrian villages. \n\nLets do this systematically:\n\n- [A million years ago the world population of humans was estimated to be only around 20,000](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/one-million-years-bc-humans-rare-10-01-21/), spread out over what's colloquially known as the \"Old World\". The \"Old World\" encompasses Africa and Eurasia and with a combined size of around 80 million square kilometres. Assuming these people gather in the \"nicer\" areas, I'm guestimating that they're spread out over roughly 30 million km^2, not necessarily in a continuous zone of occupation. [Distances like that make a bus not economically viable - (PDF)](http://www.uctc.net/research/briefs/UCTC-PB-2011-02.pdf). \n- Also the capital needed to maintain such a public transit system would simply not be around. Especially since [it would be another 997,300 years before the first coins would be made in Lydia](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/money/the_origins_of_coinage.aspx)  \n- A million years ago there were no roads. It's estimated that the [first roads were built around 7,000 to 5,000 BCE](http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a4447/the-road-ahead-road-evolution/). The wheel is dated to the earlier date, but our first evidence of paved roads is from the [Indus Valley Civilisations from around 4000 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation). We're roughly 990,000 years to early for our bus to have something to drive on, and 994,000 years for paved roads, which given the distances we would have to cover, would be highly recommended.\n- The wheel, as mentioned before, is also not available for our bus by about the same 990,000 years. Personally I wouldn't mind some form of suspension either, but lets assume our predecessors had Buns of Granite and didn't mind.   \n- But perhaps it was a public transportation sled, pulled by... ah... another minor setback. Draught animals would not be around until 4,000 BCE, so first you'd need to wait 985,000 years for the first animals to be domesticated, and then another while before you can use them to pull stuff. And then you're bitching now when you have to wait 20 minutes for the next bus, psh!\n\nIn conclusion I think it's fair to say that manspreading on a bus a million years ago would be categorically impossible. There are no roads, wheeled vehicles, methods of moving any vehicle except man-handling it, no money to pay the bus driver, and finally no demand from the small groups of humans alive for an integrated public transport system. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1.

Morale was down massively, the equipment of the army was severely lacking and they had just barely staved off an attack by Rommel where they suffered heavy casualties. Montgomery wasn't just appointed randomly when everything was going well, it was clear that a change was needed.\n\nMontgomery introduced new training methods and placed great emphasis on training physically and his own appearance, adopting a common tank beret, meeting with his soldiers, and making frequent speeches; reviving British morale.\nMontgomery then meticulously re-supplied his troops, fixing the equipment disparity. For example the British army started the first battle of El Alamein (their last battle without Montgomery) with 179 tanks. It started the second battle (When Montgomery took over) with 1,029 tanks. Montgomery even defied direct orders from Churchill which insisted he should attack, waiting until he felt his troops had what they needed.\n\nThen facing down a heavily entrenched German army with superior equipment, commanded by Rommel; having to navigate through an extensive minefield Montgomery handed Britain their first decisive victory over Germany (arguably the first decisive defeat Germany suffered in the war) all while suffering less casualties and coming close to destroying Rommel's entire army until a sand-storm prevented him from pursuing Rommel.\n\nI know Montgomery is a rather unpopular figure. He was very slow and meticulous with his approach to battles, trying his utmost to minimise casualties after what he saw on the Western Front. This leads to battles which on paper don't seem very impressive as he only attacked when he had a clear advantage. He also had a very annoying personality, rubbing US generals the wrong way, particularly after taking credit for the battle of the bulge and guess who made war movies? But anyway I think it's astonishing how incompetent some people believe Montgomery was.",

        "author": "chocolatepot",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/47efi8/womens_pockets_be_crazy/",
        "text": "I don't think there's any arguing that pockets in women's pants today are too small, but someone at Mic is [determined to argue that women's pockets have a long history of sexism](http://mic.com/articles/133948/the-weird-complicated-sexist-history-of-pockets#.BoqGQlmZM), and they're really wrong about it.\n\n&gt;Women's clothes didn't really have internal pockets for most of history, even while men's started appearing in the late 1600s. According to London's [Victoria and Albert Museum](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/history-of-pockets/), while pockets in menswear were often sewn directly into garments (like they still are today), women had to get crafty and wrap a sack with a string around their waists and tuck it way under their petticoats. \n\n&gt;The purse-like items were much harder to access, though, than pockets or purses. Back then, women wore a gown with a petticoat (or skirt); underneath that was an under-petticoat; and underneath that was a shift. A woman's makeshift pocket was hung under her dress but over the under-petticoat, making it logistically difficult to access unless she was nearly nude (by 17th-century standards). It was basically like having two fanny packs that you couldn't get too easily on either side of your skirt — very flattering. \n\nI was suspicious of this, because I've never read that 17th century women's pockets worked this way, so I checked the \"according to the V&amp;A\" link - as expected, they didn't make any such definitive statements. All it says about the 17th century is that there's a doll from the 1690s which has pockets tied on under the top petticoat, which doesn't appear to have any openings to get to the pockets. While doll clothing can give important clues about real clothing, the fact that it's not functional means that you should really not decide that because one doll's pockets were not accessible, women were totally unable to get to their pockets in everyday life. Fashion history texts that discuss the history of pockets say that they could be accessed through the petticoats at the hips.\n\nI also take issue with her calling them \"makeshift pockets\", which implies that they were seen as a pale imitation of men's pockets, which there's no evidence for.\n\n&gt;Throughout the 1700s, the pouches women used as makeshift pockets became increasingly elaborate, with women hand-sewing embellishments and embroidery. Also, another major improvement: Slits in women's dresses offer them access to their hanging pockets under their dresses and whatever those pockets may contain. If you were a woman of money (and if you had pockets, you probably were), then they could contain anything from a pincushion to jewelry to cakes. \n\nI know that everybody likes a narrative of progress, but there's no evidence that pockets became more embellished as the century went on. None. And as previously stated, pocket slits were not some new invention. They were actually not very common in gowns - most of the time, the skirt of the gown was open in front, so you would push it back and stick a hand through the side opening of your top petticoat to get to the pocket.\n\nThere's also a very, very strange assumption - that wearing pockets indicated that you were rich. What?? I suspect this is because the article on the V&amp;A website gives excerpts from Old Bailey records of thefts which are biased toward interesting descriptions of valuables. But pockets were fairly universal, the same way purses and bags are today.\n\n&gt;So, in any case, the voluminous and circle-skirted gowns of the period offered the ability for women to both wear many layers and still have access to the pockets inside, which now varied in size. We can only imagine how many cakes could fill one at a time.\n\nQuite a few cakes. Extant pockets are deep: with my reproduction, my arm goes in it up to the elbow. (Why does she think they didn't vary in size before? I don't understand.)\n\n&gt;Remember when everyone started wearing skinny jeans and then all the pockets disappeared? Well, that basically happened in the 1800s too, when the silhouette of popular dresses slimmed down into a more Grecian-inspired silhouette, leaving no room for internal \"pocket\" pouches at all. [...] \n\n&gt;So the purse was born. Reticules, as they were called, were minuscule bags that women carried in their hands rather than on their hips. \n\n(In the bit I cut out, it becomes clear that this Mic piece is completely sourced from an old piece from [Marketplace](http://www.marketplace.org/2014/09/18/tech/why-womens-pockets-are-useless-history), which is probably why it's not very good - pop history based on pop history.)\n\nThis wasn't really the birth of the purse, since people used them before pockets. [Here's](http://cottesimple.com/articles/aumonieres/) a lovely article on purses in the 14th century, for example. And while there wasn't a lot of room for pockets anymore, many less-stylish women continued to wear them.\n\n&gt;As the century ticked on, they became more elaborately decorated, just like pockets had the era before. \n\nNo, even [early](http://metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/116948) [reticules](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/228065168599508944/) were pretty elaborate.\n\n&gt;They also became a status symbol, since the bags weren't nearly large enough to carry any money, and well-to-do women tended to leave all the money-handling to men. Large reticules were looked down on because they symbolized that a woman worked and couldn't just stay home, like, sewing handkerchiefs and sipping tea or something.\n\n*So much to dismantle.* Where to begin? Well, the bags were certainly large enough to hold money. Have you ever seen a change purse? Mine's smaller than my fist yet packed with coins. To be fair, the interpretation that the small purse reflects women's lack of purchasing power is mainstream, brought up by both academics quoted in the Marketplace article ... but you know what's another mainstream interpretation? The idea that the restriction a woman felt in her corset reflected the amount that she was societally oppressed, with periods of more \"torturous\" corsets correlating with periods of greater social restriction. But this narrative has been mostly exploded by researchers like Valerie Steele, who point out that women on the whole embraced corsetry over male objection. Just because material culture can be interpreted as correlating to social issues doesn't mean it's absolute fact that they do in fact have a relationship, and you have to be careful when these things seem to line up snugly.\n\nTo go back to money, there is a status issue, but I don't believe it's quite the way the writer represents it. A well-to-do woman didn't have to handle money because she had the social capital [to have the bill sent](https://books.google.com/books?id=CytqF6DCeesC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=19th%20century%20bill%20status&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=19th%20century%20bill%20status&amp;f=false) to her home, [just like men](https://books.google.com/books?id=ENQcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=bills+tailor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKyZC0gJHLAhWM4yYKHcCUCZoQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=bills%20tailor&amp;f=false) of the same class.\n\n&gt;In the mid- to late-1800s, women started to rebel. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, dress patterns started to include instructions for sewing pockets into skirts if you felt like being an independent woman.\n\nIt really has nothing to do with rebellion - what a silly choice of words. The V&amp;A article (the same one as above) is talking about the *Workwoman's Guide*, an early-mid instruction book for home and charity sewing. It contains instructions for the tie-on pockets that women were still wearing, in several variations, as well as a simple pocket to set into a skirt. The V&amp;A says nothing about being an independent woman, as the writer implies, just describes this as a time of transition between the two styles of pocket.\n\n&gt;Women also started to take their pocket rights back in the early 1900s when they started wearing pants.  In 1933, Women's Wear Daily apparently reported on the highly controversial subject, asking its readers, \"Will women wear trousers?\" Apparently, at the time, women having fabric between their legs totally weirded people out because of bogus reasons like \"femininity.\"\n\nSorry, wait, you just said the *Workwoman's Guide* (1838) was the start of the rebellion, and now it's the 1930s? Conveniently leaving out the large portion of the 19th century in which large pockets were very frequently set into women's skirts - the ones in [this dress](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=AB3D9D6F-CFBF-4B86-910A-065165663480;type=101) or [this dress](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=D847A371-38B2-46A5-AC66-521264425450;type=101) are relatively deep and wide.\n\nThe last sentence of the paragraph is almost physically painful to me. But it's veering off topic, so I'm not going to give you a treatise on the history of women's bifurcated garments right now.\n\n&gt;But then, somewhere in the middle of the post-war 1900s, fashion had a crisis. Could there be trousers for women? How would they look? How would they be shaped? Because fashion is obsessed with slimming women's silhouettes (shocker) pockets started getting cut out of women's pants completely. \n\nThis is the last bit I can legally address, since the article then goes into the late 1990s. But the important thing here is that treating fashion as something that women are passively pushed around by whether or not they like it is a poor way of looking at history (or the present). The female consumer is an important part of the process. Something this writer did not take from the Marketplace piece is the fact that the rise of the statement handbag in the late 20th century goes along with the decline of the pocket - women were willing to lose pocket space because they were buying larger purses, making an active choice that affected the market.\n\n([Here's](http://www.vads.ac.uk/texts/POCKETS/history_of_tie-on_pockets.pdf) a better, sourced discussion of pocket history, if you're interested.)",

Decent enough museum, tons of neat artifacts.  In the bit that talks about pre-Ottoman Turkic history, one of the primary visual aids were several large paintings/murals (not sure what the right word is) across a wall.  \n\nOne room discussed the Battle of Manzikert [Edit, not Manzikert, Myriokephalon, whoops], and the mural showed the victorious Seljuks slaughtering the defeated Byzantines...  Except the Byzantine soldiers were shown as equipped with mail hauberks (again, not entirely sure on the terminology here), Great Helms/bucket helmets/paint can helmets, and carrying one-handed straight-swords.  Their tunics were white and bore large red crosses.\n\nBasically, they looked straight out of the Crusader armies that might have actually sacked Constantinople in the 4th Crusade.  Or at least Hollywoods portrayal of them.\n\nNow, the Byzantines most certainly didn't wear Catholic crosses on their uniforms, and they most certainly didn't wear that kind of armor or use those kinds of swords.\n\nI'm also fairly confident that the Great Helm concept didn't become common in the European kingdoms that actually employed them (ie not the Byzantines) until at least a few decades later.\n\nGranted, I suppose you can't expect a whole lot from a museum that spends more time discussing Armenian terrorism against innocent Turkish civilians than the, and I quote, \"So-called Genocide.\"\n\nBut that's another story that I am even less capable of telling.",

The right shoulder is already protected by a weapon, and needs to be flexible enough for that weapon to move.\n\nAlso most people are right handed, so most attacks would come in from the left.\n\n&gt;[Looking at [Artorias' armour](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/File:Artorias_Set_Male.png) you can see that his left is better protected; it's clear even under his cape there's no pauldron at all on his right...\n\n/r/darksouls disagrees\n\n&gt;In history (middle ages at least, as knights with armor at least somewhat similar to Arty's were mostly present in that time period)...\n\nThe earliest suit of armor which resembles medieval armor was found in Greece, the Dendra Panolpy. It's dated ca 1400 BC ^1\n\n&gt;there were no such things as greatshields as they were simply too big to be wielded properly with a weapon in the other hand\n\nThe Romans had pretty big shields (called scutum) ^2. Last I heard their military was pretty successful too. ^3\n\n&gt;In his boss fight, it becomes very clear that he is still capable of controlling his body and doing somersaults, flips, charges, backsteps and so on without shaking, swaying or staggering.\n\nBoss Fight for reference: https://youtu.be/KCkfWFuVNro?t=1m14s\n\nThe way he swings his sword is far from a controlled blow. You don't swing your weapon until it comes to a stop. Its is quite obvious that a fighter of his reputation would know that. So he obviously isn't in control of his actions, not swinging wildly because he's using the wrong arm.         \nI don't have a source for this I can link you to, but my uncle has been in a HEMA club for 3 years now. http://www.dreynschlag.at/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1: Nicolas Grguric, The Mycenaeans: c 1650-1100 BC         \n2: Scutum dug out at Dura-Europos excavations 1928 - 1937, currently resting in the art gallery of Yale     \n3: Hollywood",

        "text": "As promised, here is the second part of my review for the documentary, Ancient Discoveries - Chinese Warfare:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KGGSWvRGRE\n\nI have my imaginary bottle of Baijiu handy, so let us commence!\n\n20.01: Okay, there is no way any piece of siege equipment acted like a heavy duty sniper rifle. Catapults and other pieces of machinery were aimed at whole sections of walls, and were incapable of the 'pin-point accuracy' associated with modern fire-arms. DRINK!\n\n20.12: The narrator states that at the time the whirl-wind catapult was used, the Europeans were fielding counter-weight trebuchet. WRONG! The counter-weight trebuchet had been in use in Europe from the late 11th century AD onwards. The whirl-wind catapult, which is just a man-powered mangonel, had been in used in China since the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, an almost 1200 year difference. Two drinks for sheer scale. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n20.44: Europe used a variety of siege machines, including the man-powered mangonel. Stating that every single catapult required a solid frame as a basis is blatantly wrong. DRINK!\n\n21.52: That Chinese historian is so passionate. I wonder if he orders breakfast with the same intensity. \"I'll have the BOILED EGGS ON TOAST with some COFFEE AND CREAM! And I will eat that HERE! Do you have CHANGE for a TWENTY?\"\n\n21.57: A machine with the name \"Cloud Bridge\" is tall? Get out of here with that crazy!\n\n22.42: As opposed to other types of siege machines with the purpose of getting troops the bottom of a city wall.\n\n12.12: The cured hides were healthy enough to run away.\n\n23.44: The knife cart was installed with knives? Get out of here with that crazy!\n\n25.12: It is aircraft and drones that fill a similar tactical role. Satellites are strategic in nature. DRINK!\n\n25.33: I am sceptical of the claim that the gun was the greatest revolution in warfare technology ever seen. Mainly because I don't think a weapon that takes centuries to develop into a dominant, reliable and cost-effective form counts as revolutionary. One could also argue tanks, aircraft, submarines and nuclear weapons all played a role in vastly changing the way wars were fought in a similar manner. DRINK!\n\n25.47: Claiming that gunpowder resulted in China entering the era of modern warfare is hugely inaccurate. Gunpowder was really a novelty at the time of its development which did not displace traditional weapons until 900 years or so later. DRINK!\n\n26.48: That is a cannon, not a hand-gun. DRINK!\n\n27.03: Another claim of gunpowder = revolutionary. DRINK!\n\n27.13: The first known gunpowder weapon was from the 11th century, and I don't recall gunpowder being in use in Europe by the time of the First Crusade. DRINK!\n\n27.19: Another claim of gunpowder = revolutionary. DRINK!\n\n28.10: TOO. MANY. JOKES.\n\n28.38: BWAHAHAHAHAHA! The Chinese presenter completely contradicts what the narrator said earlier. The narrator said the first gun was from 1351, and the presenter states the current weapon dates from 1332. Two drinks. One for the narrator's error, one for the hilarity. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n30.50: The claim that the Chinese crossbow was responsible for countless victories is exaggeration of the worst sort. Many Chinese armies with crossbows were defeated by the Khitan, for example. DRINK!\n\n31.00: I guess you could say there are very few ancient Chinese crossbows.... puts on glasses ...... in stock. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!\n\n33.34: Okay, I truly doubt the veracity of the claim that a single family can be traced back two and a half thousand years. As 'Obama' has demonstrated, we have trouble finding birth certificates even now. DRINK!\n\n33.48: The bowyer mentions he does not know how many generations his family has made bows for. A shame our narrator does not admit likewise. \n\n34.00: If it was an archaeological relic it would be known as a Han-Old crossbow. Hachachachacha!\n\n35.05: \"It was called crossbow-loaded-with-feet\". This is incorrect. Feet were not aerodynamic enough to be used as ammunition.\n\n35.26: A modern .375 magnum bullet travels at around 1400 feet per second, give or take a hundred feet or two. This website:\n\nhttp://www.thebeckoning.com/medieval/crossbow/cross_l_v_c.html\n\nStates that a crossbow drawn by a cranequin (it does not state if the crossbow has steel, wood or composite arms) can launch a bolt 138.7 fps. The sheer inaccuracy requires four drinks. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!\n\n35.53: Narrator fails to credit famed inventor and strategist Zhuge \"Don't believe everything you read\" Liang with creating the repeating crossbow. DRINK!\n\n36.50: The narrator is severely over-estimating the effectiveness of the repeating crossbow. It had a short range, the bolts were unfletched (and thus inaccurate) and they had a low velocity, meaning they could not pierce even padded armour. DRINK!\n\n37.17: Farmers serving as conscripted troops were common only during the Qin, Han and Tang Dynasties, and even in the Han and Tang there was a gradual move towards full-time permanent troops. DRINK!\n\n38.15: Another gunpowder = modern era assertion. DRINK!\n\n39.39: Yeah, I'm pretty sure a weapon can't be half-grenade and half-bomb. It needs to be one or the other. DRINK!\n\n40.20: GAH! WE KNOW THE CHINESE HAD BEEN USING ROCKET PROPELLED ARROWS FOR A WHILE NOW. IT IS NOT A QUESTION WE MUST ASK! IT HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED! DRINK!\n\nWell, and that is done. I have got to start restricting myself to the shorter documentaries. I don't think my mind and liver can take much more!\n\nSources:\n\nThe Age of Confucian Rule: The Song Transformation of China, by Dieter Kuhn and Timothy Brook \n\nAncient Chinese Warfare, by Ralph Sawyer\n\nChina's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty, by Mark Edward Lewis\n\nThe Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han, by Mark Edward Lewis\n\nEurope Between the Oceans: 9000 BC-AD 1000, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nImperial Chinese Armies (2), by C.J.

        "text": "(Maiden effort here: thank you for not cat-calling too loudly.)\n\nA new media to breach!\n\nAll last year my husband and I were annoyed by the paintings in the Wells Fargo calendar for 2015, \"The John Rush Collection.\" They commissioned these historical paintings in 2009 especially for the calendar, since every one features a Wells Fargo stage coach, whether it makes sense or not.\n\nYou can find the images [here](http://other-worlds.org/whatthe/Calendar1.jpg) and [here](http://other-worlds.org/whatthe/Calendar2.jpg) to follow along.\n\nNow, we had no trouble with January (except some /r/badhorseuse, or why are part of those reins so slack when they aren't making a turn, but running down a straightaway?). Ditto February, March, June, or September. But May was so bad I flashed on it the whole rest of the year, and April had its problems, both in \"storytelling sense\" and bad railroad practice. November and December were pretty obviously bad, too.\n\nA great deal of this is bad social history, or \"Why are these people doing this anachronistic thing?\" which may overlap with /r/nocommonsense.\n\nFirst, we know that the Wells Fargo stage coaches only ran for a decade, from 1860-1869. This gives us (and John Rush) a nice tight frame on [fashions worn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860s_in_Western_fashion). This is really good for him because he obviously can't paint anything he isn't looking at. Therefore, there are only two women, always wearing the exact same dresses, throughout the calendar. Oh, wait, in the November dock scene, he has a third -- who looks exactly like one of the others, just with her skirt done in white instead of grey.\n\nTo start with, someone needed to tell this man that a woman travelling any distance will wear a travelling dress, not a day dress or visiting dress. That means dark-coloured and narrow, even in the age of hoop skirts. At least he got right that you can't fit a hoop, even a crinolette, down the aisle of a parlor car, let alone in a coach which crams 8 people inside: 3 on each bench and 2 on jumpseats against the doors. What's missing is the hoop in its bag on top of the coach, so that the fashionable Beauty in Pink can use it when she gets where she's going. That's what women had to do. And, no, she can't send it ahead by train. Duh, if a train went there she wouldn't be taking a crummy stagecoach. Coaches only ran where the rails didn't. That's why their era was so short. By 1868 Wells Fargo only ran from the rail ends to the mining camps, not to any real points of civilization. So we can reasonably place this 1860-1864 or 5.\n\nRush makes a really big deal of how everyone, male and female, adores and ogles BIP in the October painting. That sort of belle would have her hoop with her as part of her luggage. She would also slap in the face with her fan the two men hanging out the coach windows to stare at her as she gets down. What, they haven't been looking at her for the last two days on board the coach? This is Bad Social History: women viewed ogling as an insult, not a compliment. Gentlemen in top hats ought to behave better than Forty-niners who haven't seen a white woman in three years (*Women of the Gold Rush*).\n\nBut, really, after travelling even one day in that open-windowed coach, her pink skirts would be a dusty, dirty mess. Better to start with a dirty, dusty colour like drab (khaki) or tobacco, that doesn't look like you expected to arrive clean. That was the whole theory to \"travelling dress.\" Which is why in the November dock scene, the woman debarking would not be wearing a white skirt. Sailing ships are full of tarred things just waiting to snag and smudge a white skirt caught on the breeze.\n\nSimply, Rush stuck himself with unsuitable costuming for his models, and no one involved in the project had the knowledge to call him out on it.\n\nLet's talk more about that dock scene. The ships are sea-going, so this isn't St. Louis, but the San Francisco terminus of Wells Fargo operations. The Wells Fargo stage is pulled up on the dock to pick up passengers and cargo --\n\nNo. Stop right there, Rush. \n\nSailing ships, at the mercy of winds and calms, had a hard time sticking to schedules. They could not radio ahead that they were being delayed: no radio for decades. So absolutely no one would have sent a coach in advance to pick up passengers. It would be a waste of time and the coach. A Wells Fargo freight wagon might have shown up once WF was notified an expected cargo's ship had come in, but they would not carry passengers. It is the business of the passengers to hie themselves down to the WF depot where they will board the stagecoach. After all, someone might be too sick to travel farther, or have decided to delay a few days with shipboard friends, any number of reasons to not take a particular departure overland. It wasn't like booking a flight back home after your vacation cruise, with a courtesy shuttle to the airport.\n\nEqually, if this is supposed to be the end of the line for westbound passengers, the stagecoach does not go down to the docks because 1) not all passengers are going there, 2) not all of them are going there right now, 3) they have no way to know if the ship(s) they are taking is in yet or ready to depart, 4) all of the above.\n\nSimply, it was the passenger's concern to come to WF or to go about their business after getting off the coach.\n\nAs well, only one ship has its sails properly furled. The one to the right with the top gallants alone is especially dangerous, as I was told by the old salt who had his sailing ship master's papers and lived on a two-masted 70-footer. If the wind catches those top gallants, it's going to tilt the whole ship over and slam the hull into the dock, especially if she's only in ballast. Ships furled their sails when the steam tug took the ship in tow. They never had the sails out near the docks in this period.\n\nOf course, there's also no room on that dock to turn the coach around to face back to shore. They would have had to have backed the coach into that position. With a team of six, very unlikely. For the probable distance, it would injure the horses.\n\nWhat looks like \"the other end of the line\" is December. BIP and three men are making their way through blowing snow from a brick building to the coach. There's so much breeze everyone is hanging onto their headgear, even BIP whose bonnet ties under the chin. The leafless tree branches twine a maze above them. The snow is fetlock-deep on the ground. For those of you who don't know fetlocks, all the gents' shoes and cuffs are under the snow.\n\nFive of the six men in the picture are wearing overcoats. Not a single one has his overcoat buttoned closed, though. They like that brisk, refreshing iciness blowing around their chests. Medical knowledge of the period would have predicted fatal pneumonia for the lot of them.\n\nOne man, and BIP, don't even have overcoats, but they came out in this weather. BIP has a waist-length cape that is completely open down the front, and completely useless, blowing behind her.\n\nWomen wore sturdy winter coats to the hip in this sort of weather, and we can find examples in pictures of, say, pedestrians in New York City or Boston. She doesn't need a long coat because the multiple layers of skirts is quite warm, starting with the red flannel union suit under it all. To crown the costume stupidity, BIP is still wearing the same bonnet as in all other pictures: summer straw, with summer trimmings. Fashion of the day was extremely particular about seasonal clothing, if only to keep the weights right for cooling or warming. The idea to a straw bonnet is that it would not overheat the head by letting heat escape and even a bit of cooler air leak in. She should be wearing a wool or velvet hat.\n\nAs well, this stiff breeze affects her skirts not at all. The upper layers should be blown inward and back. Neither does the snow drag at her hems, though it's up to her ankles. The snow behind her, that her hems should have made a trail in, is still undisturbed for the cuff-deep gents behind her. So it seems she has just been standing in the snowstorm in her stiffly starched skirts with chains in the hems to hold them down, letting the snow build up around her and fill her track.\n\nIn a bout of bad social history, none of the men, including the WF official, has offered his arm to help the fragile beauty make her way against the wind. Instead, she forges ahead, first in line by several lengths, with no one to open the shut door of the coach for her (at least the steps have been let down, but I question whether this was possible with the door shut). This after the October painting, where the whole focus of the scene is on the driver giving the lady an uncomfortable-looking hand down from the stage, while even other women gape at her beauty.\n\nFor further behavior stupidity, July takes place obviously around the Fourth, by the bunting hung on buildings. Three boys are running as one rolls his hoop along -- right into the forequarters of the lead pair of horses being taken out of the traces. The foremost boy is on course for a head-to-head collision with the off leader. The ostler leading the horses smiles benignly, undoubtedly thinking, \"At long last those little pains in the ass are going to get crippled or killed, and won't be bothering us any more.\"\n\nThe horses do not wear blinders in this or any other painting (this alone flies in the face of practices of the time, a major anachronism). They can see this weird shiny (horses spook at shiny) round thing running at them (horses spook at unusual objects, especially charging them), along with three charging boys, one of them pointing as if shouting, \"Look at that!\" like he never saw a stagecoach before.\n\nThe horses should be freaking. They should be either getting ready to strike and bite at the menace, or spooking away from them with their combined ton of weight. No one human being is going to hold them if they take off.\n\nIn any case, you don't change horses in the middle of Main Street. It's done at a WF station, if only a large livery stable, where other horses are stabled and held ready harnessed to be switched in when the coach arrives and, notably, wild brats can't upset the schedule or cause accidents.\n\nChildren back then knew better than to behave like this around large, dangerously skittish animals. Or they died young. The painting apparently shows 6 seconds before termination of their genetic contribution, lucky for us.\n\nAugust merely has the horses being changed out, possibly at the stage station shown in June, by the Brobdignagian Brothers. The topline of the coach horses only comes to the lower chest on these guys, making them about eight feet tall or else they are running coach ponies. My husband is over six feet and has to reach up to a saddle horn. These look more like Spruytte and his chariot ponies in *Ancient Harness Systems*.\n\nIn April, we have to ask what sort of hugger-mugger is going down, that the train and the coach are meeting to transfer ... something ... in the middle of nowhere. Actually, by evidence of the engine, just out of sight of a town. The road is little-used, unrutted and only a single lane, unless the ratty-road repair crew just came by with fresh dirt to roll down. \n\nThe train is holding still: look at the woman standing on the steps between the cars. Yet it's got a draught going like it was making speed uphill. (That means it has a huge column of smoke and steam from its funnel.) The smoke is black, as from an ill-made fire. The tender is full of wood, indicating it was just re-fueled: its fires should not have built back up yet. The fireman is at his leisure, rather than stoking, standing behind the cab watching the horses. Great novelty in the 1860s, horses. The engineer is in a position as if they were in motion. The cab looks strangely bare, with no overhead quadrants (a bunch of levers and the casings they go into) which should partly block the view through the windows.\n\nStagecoach lines did not run parallel to rail lines in the West. They did in Europe, because the trains were replacing the roads and their coaches. In the West, coaches served communities that did not yet have rail service: they couldn't compete for cheapness, speed, comfort, and safety. So these two vehicles should only be meeting at a place with a rail station with the WF station next to it at a terminus, or at a crossing of road and rails, not a passing point.\n\nWhat modern people don't understand is that trains were almighty tall. They come up to stations with platforms, and people still have to climb stairs into them. Stopping in the middle of nowhere meant women, children, and the elderly or infirm couldn't safely get up and down. That's why where they stop is some kind of station: the railroads provided these platforms, which also facilitated moving freight in and out. So unless it's an emergency, they aren't stopping in the empty countryside like this. The WF coach isn't changing horses without a stage station, either, though here they are buckling girths and picking up luggage. As carriers of the mail and banking papers, they are targets for robbers, so they don't stop along the road to pick up stray passengers.\n\nSimply, the stations are missing here, both the rail station right smack next to the tracks, and the WF station right next to the coach.\n\nSeptember merely has a \"curve of beauty\" road that sweeps in an ess too tight for a six-up, rather that running straight. It makes it more visually interesting, which may be good painting but silly driving.\n\nAh, May. The sound you hear is my teeth grinding at seeing this once again, as the coach fords a very slow river. The water isn't even up to the hubs of the front wheels.\n\nSomewhere, the coach has acquired the company of two men on horseback. Besides them, there are the driver (on the box), the shotgun and three male passengers down in the water, and two women, wading knee-deep.\n\nRush is confusing stage-coach passengers, especially of the quality of BIP, with pioneer families trying to get the wagon to Oregon. Tough pioneer women might drag themselves through the current and mire, since their husbands told them to: ladies paying passage did not, not under the depicted placid conditions.\n\nThe four men down are trying to turn the wheels while the horses pull. This would mean a deeply muddy bottom, sucking at the wheels. If they must lighten the coach, it would make much more sense to remove the luggage on the roof, and maybe in the boot, take it across, and leave the much lighter women in the coach, which would lower its center of gravity as well. It's the age of assumed female fragility: expecting them to drag themselves through the deep mire under the water is simply unreasonable. As well expect them to flap their arms and fly. If one falls as a result and drowns ...\n\nThere are paintings of the early 1800s of British stagecoaches fording flooded rivers with all passengers aboard, though the water is nearly up to the floorboards. This isn't half as dangerous, and no one got down in Britain, male or female.\n\nAt the very least, the ladies should be riding pillion behind the two horsemen. Those guys are doing nothing at all to help. Rush just has no concept of social behavior of the time, nor of the medical theory that abhorred going in the water, except for the very strong and athletic (and some physicians thought healthy young men shouldn't go swimming, either).\n\nHe also has no concept of fabric behavior. Right now, the women look like they were photographed walking along the sidewalk and Photoshopped into the river. Their skirts do not float on the current, nor are they soaked to the waist by the fabric wicking up water. Wet skirts and petticoats of this dimension could add 20 pounds of water to the weight of the clothing. Paying lady passengers are not going to accept slogging ankle-deep through muddy bottom, with several sheets of lead attached to their waists, and the health dangers of a soaking. The coach can get across, then unhitch a couple of horses, bring them back, and lead them over with the ladies aboard. This would be the normal procedure.\n\nThere are plenty of Western historical painters who would never have made such glaring faux pas, or even little bloopers. Instead, WF gave a bunch of money to this bozo to paint two or three pictures a year based on photo-composite and no good sense.\n\nThis year we have a Chinese good luck calendar with pretty calligraphy and no insults to our intelligence or historical and technical knowledge.\n",

        "text": "The \"just following orders\" argument comes up a lot as a way to excuse all sorts of bad behaviour. I don't think we really need to discuss the fact that this argument exists. It's everywhere.\n\nFor the most part, I've been staunchly \"that's a load of BS\" and I gather most other members of various the badacademia/sws/etc circle will agree (we've seen responses to this mentality numerous times).But lately I've been rethinking it a bit.\n\nFor some context;\n\nWas discussing the civil war with a friend (neither of us are civil war experts) who is a southerner. He is very anti-union battle flag, anti-south will rise again etc. He's a good one. \n\nBut he raised a good point:\n\nYou're some bum farmer or tradesman in the South. You don't own any slaves and likely don't know anyone who does. In this case your particular views on race are irrelevant to the point at hand.\n\nTrouble's a' brewin. There's gonna be some shootin' and some fightin' and some doins in your neck of the woods. Something something the North? All you know is your friends and family are at risk (or at least perceived to be) and several others have taken up arms. \n\nIs it really that unreasonable to say that some joe dirt taking up arms to fight along side brothers or because there are *bad guys* in the area, is all that bad? Certainly I understand there's a greater scope of things in regards to rights and slavery and all this- but I think the inevitable reverse circlejerk is sometimes all too eager to dismiss them entirely. \n\nSince I don't know much about the civil war, can anyone speak to this?\n\n\n\nNow the second part refers to WW2. After having that discussion I started to think of some parallels. You grow up in 1930s Germany. Let's say you don't buy into the Nazi thing and are at least  fairly skeptical of the whole movement. \n\nWhat are you supposed to do? I for one, as fervently anti-nazi as I am don't really know that I could or would do a whole lot. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be signing up for KZ duty that's for sure. But really and truly, given threat of invasion (Russian or Western allied), bombings and such in my cities, my people being killed and well... that whole conscription thing- something tells me I wouldn't be as noble as I'd like to be. \n\nReally, just how reasonable would it have been to be a German in  1940 or earlier, be totally against the current political climate and just uproot your entire family, escape Europe and move to... England? Canada? \n\n\nTypically, the discussion of late  around these parts goes like this:\n\n&gt; Not all Germans were Nazis.\n\n&gt; Yes but they still fought for them\n\nor\n\n&gt; Not all Germans were nazis\n\n&gt; Yes but they didn't do anything about it/Hitler still won the vote\n\nor some such response.  But really, I don't know what I would have done had I received a conscription letter, or witnessed the changes around the country in the middle of the 1930s.\n\n\n\nummm",

        "text": "I’ve done RedPill stuff before, and one of my favorite masochistic hobbies is exploring the ways that reactionaries misremember the past, usually the 1950’s. Note: any current statistics I use I will use ONLY to contrast, I’m going to stay off of present day as much as possible. \n\n[This particular piece](http://archive.is/YJRJP) pulls the usual reactionary move of hearkening back to the fictional utopia of 1950…. but bafflingly applies all of the usual nonsense about our perfectly moral past existence to the 1970’s and the 1980’s, where they are even less correct than usual. The author tries to paint the American 70’s and 80’s as a completely foreign world, where men were men and women were women, and gets it all wrong in the process. \n\n**History of Feminism**\n\nThis statement will also serve as my R5:\n\n&gt;“If your father courted and married in the 1970s and 80s, he was a young man in a world where people communicated face to face or over the telephone. Reassuring a lady’s parents was essential. Feminism was still a fringe idea like Gaia or vegetarianism.”\n\nFeminism was not a fringe movement in the 70's and 80's. \n\nThe article begins in earnest, bafflingly, with a black and white photo of a couple sharing a milkshake, further underlining my belief that the author has mixed up the 50’s and the 80’s. The first baffling historical error is the insistence that “feminism was still a fringe idea.” By almost any definition of feminism, and almost any definition of fringe, this is wrong. Seneca falls happened in 1848, women’s suffrage in 1920. By the 70’s and 80’s, feminism was well into it’s second wave. In 1963, Feminine Mystique was written and the Equal Pay Act was signed into law. Feminists in the 70’s would win such victories as the legalization of no-fault divorce (in some states), the application of the 14th amendment to specifically address discrimination against women (Reed v Reed), the legalization of birth control for unmarried couples (Eistenstadt v Baird), and of course Roe v Wade. I could go on, but you get the point: this was  lot of legal victories for a “fringe movement”. Really, just visit the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism) for Second-Wave Feminism. They had a lot going on. \n\nTo get another sense of the place in the public eye, check out this piece, and ask yourself why such a fringe movement would have the honor, in 1975, of having “American Women” named as [Time’s Person of the Year](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/living/the-seventies-feminism-womens-lib/) (I’m sure Gaia was 1976). Typical of a reactionary, the author tries to paint feminism as a recent invention as an attempt to undermine the decades - long struggle of millions of women for their rights.\n\n**History of Sexual Activity**\n\nAfter more bafflingly anachronistic black and white photos, the article continues with some good old - fashioned hysteria about kids these days, including:\n\n&gt;“Your father dated women who were virgins or who had only slept with one or two partners before, probably their steady ex-boyfriends…. Your father did not date the kind of women you date—women who have slept with 20-100 men, who have had many, many one-night-stands, and who usually have a couple fuck-buddies on call at any given time.”\n\nIn reality, your father only had a better chance than you do of sleeping with a virgin if the girl in question is between 17 and 18. Really. Look at the statistics here on [median ages of first instance of premarital sex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/). As you can see, for cohorts turning 15 in the 70’s and 80’s, the median age of premarital sexual activity was 18.0 - 18.6. For the most recent data in the early 2000’s, it was 17.6, actually higher than the cohort in the early 90’s. For the cohort turning 15 between ‘74 and ‘83, 72% of respondents had premarital sex by age 20; for those turning 15 between ‘95 and 2002, 74% had sex before age 20. Barring numbers on the number of partners, there is no evidence for this massive change in sexual mores that the author and so many reactionary commentators claim. Premarital sex was normative in the 70’s and 80’s as it was now. \n\nOn a slight tangent, [this piece](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21606795-todays-young-people-are-held-be-alienated-unhappy-violent-failures-they-are-proving) by the Economist is a great rebuttal of a lot of “kids these days are so (insert insult here)” conversations. \n\n**History of Divorce**\n\n&gt;“Your father married at a time when divorce was a new-fangled and disgraceful thing, something that respectable people didn’t do”\n\nMaybe the wrongest thing yet. [The statistics are right here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/23/144-years-of-marriage-and-divorce-in-the-united-states-in-one-chart/). Divorce rates rose during the 70’s, and peaked at 1980. There were more divorces per 1000 people in 1980 than there are today, it is no modern invention thought up by the equally modern feminists to deprive men of their money. Not much else to say really, this is just wrong. \n\nThe author is trying to take us back to an imaginary past that never existed. In many ways, this is why history and bad history are important: misunderstanding the past is an essential part of many ideologies of hate. The Red Pill and other misogynist movements need the narrative that feminism has, very recently, turned women from perfect virgin angels into divorce-happy sexual vacuum cleaners. Luckily for us, the facts don’t back them up. \n\nSemi new poster, let me know if I did anything wrong. \n",

        "text": "So this series is what made me begin to dislike Extra History. But before I start I want to preface some things. Not all of the bad history is Extra History's fault. This I understand very clearly. Most English history books on Japan touch on the Sengoku Jidai in the following fashion. They go from a rough outbreak of the Onin War to a general overview of the three unifiers. Following that they might examine the social and economic impacts of war in general terms, like the gekokujo, consolidation, expansion of trade, social mobility. They'll then talk about the impact of Europeans, and often times precipitate the myth of the military revolution, of guns tipping the balance, etc. Therefore there's a lack of sources for detailed politics and military campaigns. Osprey publishing in general, and Stephen Turnbull in particular, tries to fill this gap. Their information on things which focus on using archeology, paintings, surviving artifacts and things like mobilization orders are great. Unfortunately the same can not be said about their politics and military campaign works. Most seem to be taken from history books from Imperial Japan, when the military establishment took to spicing up Japanese military history using Edo era fiction in order to create a military national legend comparable to that of Europe. The new research since the 60s, spearheaded by the likes of Mitsuyoshi Takayanagi and focusing on pairing archeology with contemporary sources while trying to pick out biases, have not been translated. Unfortunately Extra History focuses on the military and politics of the unifiers. So a lot of Extra History's mistakes are simply due to bad English sources. So a lot of times I'm actually complaining about the lack of good English sources as well.\n\nNot all the time mind you. I'll point out when I think it's a source problem. I also won’t point out things they correct themselves in the lies. And it’s the things they should have got correct despite the bad sources that made me dislike them. All right here we go.\n\nEpisode One:\n\n&gt;Personalities like Miyamoto Musashi.\n\nNo. See bottom.\n\n&gt;Hattori Hanzo (dressed like a Kabuki ninja).\n\nNo. Whether or not he was a ninja was debatable (in all likelihood not), but kabuki ninja is known to be fiction and he would’ve dressed as the samurai then daimyo he was. But \"ooooo ninja\" x1.  \nAlso since it’s okay to be pedantic, his name was Hattori Masanari.\n\nPretty accurate until we get to the Okehazama campaign.\n\n&gt;The Imagawa forces are going to march on to the final great Oda Castle, destroy their last major rival, and sweep on to take Kyoto.\n\nNo. Oda Nobunaga’s main castle was Kiyosu Castle. The campaign was fighting for the control of South Eastern Owari, specifically the castles Narumi and Odaka, which are under Imagawa control and threatens Ise Bay. Nobunaga had constructed forts and laid siege to the two castles, and Imagawa Yoshimoto is marching to their relieve. With Owari still mostly hostile, and Mino still in the way, it is frankly unthinkable that Imagawa would straight up march to Kyoto in this situation.\n\n&gt;[Oda Nobunaga’s] information sources are still good, and he knows the Imagawa forces are resting in a gorge.\n\nSo this one is sources problem. No they were resting on top of a hill.  \nThe rest isn’t a source problem. EH shows that the entire 25000 were resting there. No only about 5000 were resting there. Also Oda Nobunaga’s assault force of 2000 and diversion of 500 were not his only forces. He had others in forts and castles. I mean he was still sieging two castles here. There’s some revision of Imagawa numbers but it’s not set yet so I’ll let it slide.\n\n&gt;[Nobunaga sneaks into the valley and kills Imagawa Yoshimoto]. \n\nSo as mentioned above, Imagawa Yoshimoto was camped on a hill/mountain with ~5000 men. And from our primary sources, Shinchokoki, Nobunaga probably didn’t know he was attacking Imagawa Yoshimoto’s direct forces until after the fact. This is a source problem.\n\n&gt;The Imagawa army evaporates…This force was everything. The Imagawa thought they were going all the way to Kyoto with this army so they brought everything they had. The weakened Imagawa are now just carrion for their hungry neighbours. All of those clans around them descend on their land and carve it up between them. The young leader of the Matsudaira understood which way the wind was blowing. As he watched the routing Imagawa forces stream pass his captured hillfort, he decided it was time to meet the young lord of the Oda.\n\nNo. Imagawa forces actually retreats pretty well considering the situation. Narumi Castle held out so well that Nobunaga agreed to give back Yoshimoto’s head for the castle. Matsudaira Motoyasu (later Tokugawa Ieyasu) however abandoned Odaka Castle, retreated back to Mikawa. In the end the Oda took back south eastern Owari from Imagawa forces, but had to stop at that.  \nThe first one to betray the Imagawa was actually Matsudaira Motoyasu, by declaring independence and then signing an alliance with Oda Nobunaga *two years later*. The alliance was so the Oda can focus on Mino while the Matsudaira could focus on retaking Mikawa and perhaps march on Totomi. So he was actually the first to betray the Imagawa.  \nIn the graphics, it’s shown that the Takeda, Uesugi, and Hojo descended on the Imagawa. But only the Takeda (the ally mentioned in the video) did. Uesugi was quite far way from Suruga so they weren’t going to do anything. They were actually busy fighting the Hojo and Takeda. The Takeda did not attack until 1568, *eight years* after the Okehazama campaign and, when they finally decided they weren’t getting anywhere opposing the Uesugi and decided to switch focus (and Matsudaira invited them). The Hojo actually honored their alliance and declared war on the Takeda, though they didn’t do much.  \nSo the Matsudaira was actually the only clan to turn on the Imagawa directly because of Yoshimoto’s death. The Takeda did only far later when they were free to do so and when it was clear the Imagawa had severely weakened. There’s no mass descent on the Imagawa by its neighbours.\n\nOn to Episode 2!\n\n&gt;Why didn’t one of [Hojo, Takeda, Uesugi] march west and steam-roll everything between them and Kyoto? Well because one of them start to, one of the others would invade their territory.\n\nNo. By this point (I’m actually unclear what year we’re in due to them jumping from event to event, sometimes backwards in time, but I’ll just take 1562 when the Oda-Matsudaira alliance was created), Uesugi Kenshin had in fact brought an army to Kyoto twice. Both times he had to publicly declare basically “I’m just going to Kyoto to help the Shogun, I’ve got no quarrel with any of you on the way there, please let me through.” And that’s the real reason. None of the three were anywhere near Kyoto, and even if they did arrive in Kyoto if they didn’t control everything in between it’s pointless. So they were busy expanding their territory in their vicinity. They were simply not powerful enough to “steam-roll everything between them and Kyoto”. I mean just look at the Imagawa. When Takeda Shingen tried between 1568-1573 he got as far as parts of Mikawa. Uesugi Kenshin steadily expanded west, but only got as far as parts of Kaga by 1577.  \nAnd if you think “why didn’t one of them just sign an alliance with another like the Oda did with the Matsudaira”, well they did.\n\n&gt;[Nobunaga wants to march on Kyoto. With only the Azai and the Saito on the way, he marries his sister to the lord of the Azai. Then he was about to sign a deal with his father in law Saito Dosan, but Saito Dosan is murdered by his son, Saito Yoshitatsu. So war it is.]\n\nNo. So first we have a major chronology problem Saito Yoshitatsu rebelled against and killed his father *in battle* in 1556. Nobunaga honored his alliance with Dosan and marched into Mino, but couldn’t save him, and had to withdraw to deal with the Imagawa. This is *four years* before Okehazama. The alliance with Azai Nagamasa took place in 1564, and Oichi’s marriage to Nagamasa took place in 1567 or 68. Mino was conquered in 1567.  \nSecond, Yoshitatsu died in 1561, and it was the instability of his 14 year old son inheriting Mino that allowed Nobunaga to invade. But the two sides had been at war since Dosan’s death.   \n\n&gt;Toyotomi’s specialty was administration and diplomacy. He was a descent enough warrior, I guess, but that’s not what Oda needed right now. [Toyotomi Hideyoshi turns Saito’s retainers to Nobunaga’s side.]\n\nToyotomi Hideyoshi was a fantastic general, though he’s still small. Also if he acted as messenger for some of the Saito retainers, the offers for leniency was from Nobunaga, and he certainly weren’t messenger to them all. Enabling all this was very heavy faction infighting within the Saito.\n\n&gt;[Toyotomi Hideyoshi builds Sunomata castle right under Inabayama castle with such speed that the Saito couldn’t do anything.]\n\nThis is a source problem, but EH gets credit for admitting the one night castle is probably legend.\nSo first there had been previous castles at the Sunomata site. Second, there’s no contemporary source saying Toyotomi Hideyoshi built it. Shinchokoki doesn’t say who built it. Taikoki said Hideyoshi *was given a castle*, but despite mentioning Sunomata in other places, does not say it was Sunomata.  \nBy the way Sunomata is 15km from Inabayama by modern road. Not really right under Inabayama castle.\n\n&gt;[Oda Nobunaga lays siege to Inabayama, and use Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s trick to throw open the gates.]\n\nComplete fiction. Not even sure where they got this from. There was a battle near the castle. Oda wins. He’s joined by ex-Saito forces. He orders Toyotomi Hideyoshi to burn the castle town to clear the place for siege. On seeing the castle town in ashes, the castle surrenders to prevent suffering the same fate.\n\nOn to Episode 3!\n\n&gt;Nobunaga’s first response was to fight everybody.\n\nNo. His first response is that Azai’s betrayal was a rouse. Once the betrayal was clear he ordered a retreat.\n\n&gt;[11 year siege of Ishiyama Honganji]\n\nWell no. Honganji between 1570 till 1575 fought Nobunaga on and off. Only once their resistance solidified in 1576 did the siege actually start. So the siege was for 5 years. Still the longest siege though.  \n\nAlso just to be pedantic, the gun troops in the previous battle (not all were monks, in fact most were probably mercenaries) were from Kii Province, not Ishiyama Honganji (in Izumi Province) itself.\n\n&gt;The Azai and Asakura were back in it, coming after him with the warrior monks of Enriyakuji.\n\nNot really. They came at Nobunaga with their own army, and when Nobunaga turned around to fight them they decided to go hole up in Enriyakuji. If Enriyakuji had warrior monks, they didn’t attack Nobunaga but just offered shelter to the Azai and Asakura.\n\nActually the most accurate episode. On to Episode 4.\n\n&gt;[Takeda Shingen is literately the guy who invented the cavalry charge for feudal Japan]\n\nNo no No NO NOOO. Where the fuck did this come from?  \nActually I think I know. Anyway it’s bullshit.\n\n&gt;[The Takeda] honestly weren’t even coming for him but for making a stab at Kyoto behind him.\n\nNo. Remember I said there’s no point going to Kyoto unless you have everything in between? Well the Takeda had basically been skirmishing with the Tokugawa since they wiped out the Imagawa together.\n\n&gt;[Tokugawa Ieyasu sets up on an open plain for his arquebus, but it backfires to the Takeda cavalry charge.]\n\nMikatagahara was an open plateau. If you think it was a stupid idea to put arquebus out in the open, well so did Ieyasu. He didn’t pick the field, he was drawn into it by Takeda Shingen. Ieyasu thought he was shadowing/pursuing the Takeda forces who looked like they were moving off, he didn’t expect them to turn around and fight.  \nI think it’s good to say here that Sengoku Japan did not employ cavalry the way Europeans did, concentrated large number of independent squadrons. Instead in battle they were employed mixed together with the infantry, usually forming the third part of a mixed formation. So it wasn’t really a cavalry charge than won the day, just straight up the army that’s twice as big as the other won.  \nThis is half a source problem me thinks.  \n\n&gt;[Hattori Hanzo’s night attack]\n\nNo. There was no ninja attack. The attack, if it happened at all (could be Edo government propaganda as there's no contemporary account), was simply a night raid by proper troops, and was actually pretty even fight (depend on which source you ask). It wasn’t even lead by Hattori Masanari. But \"ooooo ninjas\" x2.  \nAlso there’s a difference between arriving back at the castle with only 5 men, and only having 5 men to defend the castle. Apparently EH thinks people just abandon forts when they sally out.\n\n&gt;Of course the Takeda retreat was also motivated by the fear that…\n\nNo I’m not even going to bother quoting the rest. Because Takeda Shingen stayed in Totomi after Mikatagahara.\n\n&gt;It makes absolutely no sense for [the ninjas/Hattori Hanzo] not to betray Tokugawa when he was down to his last five men.\n\nMaybe because there was no band of ninjas and Tokugawa Ieyasu wasn’t down to his last five men.\n\n&gt;In 1573 Takeda Shingen comes barreling back into Mikawa\n\nHe never left.\n\n&gt;At a minor castle siege, Takeda Shingen is shot by a sniper and dies.\n\nIf he’s shot (possible), he held on for over 2 months after. The consensus is he was just sick. The Takeda go back to Kai/Shinano because Shingen was on his death bed.\n\nI just want to say here that militarily I don’t think Katsuyori is worse than Shingen.  \nAlso from here until the end of the episode it’s source problem. I’m guessing a Stephen Turnbull problem.\n\n&gt;[Plot to betray Ieyasu caused Katsuyori to invade, but is foiled.]\n\nFiction. Okudaira, a Mikawa clan that had surrendered to Shingen betrays Katsuyori. Tokugawa Ieyasu orders them to man Nagashino. So Katsuyori sieges it. By the way they keep using the graphics of the Takeda marching to Kyoto. Definitely doesn’t apply here.\n\n&gt;[The bravery of Suneomon]\n\nPossibly Edo era propaganda.\n\n&gt;[Incredibly Takeda cavalry…The Takeda cavalry come thundering down…]\n\nTakeda’s cavalry is very good. But again there’s no cavalry charge as we imagine it.\n\n&gt;They hastily thrown up a bamboo palisade, a loose fence to blunt the enemy charge.\n\nThey spent 2 days throwing up an elaborate system of field fortifications of one to three sets of ditches, trenches, and bamboo palisades on wooded hills with a few streams running along the entire front.\n\n&gt;Behind it they placed three thousand arquebuses firing in volley.\n\nNobunaga did not have 3000 guns at the campaign. According to the Shinchokoki he sent 500 guns on the raid to the siegeworks around Nagashino. This is really important, as it lifts the siege, cuts off the Takeda retreat, and place troops in place for pursuit. It probably influenced Katsuyori’s decision to accept battle.  \nFor the main battle, he had \"about 1000 guns\". Even adding Tokugawa's guns would give us under 2000 for the entire campaign. Rotating volley was not recorded in contemporary sources. If it happened, it couldn't have took place across the entire battlefield, because if evenly distributed they would've had 1 gun per meter of front. And while militarily Katsuyori might not be as good as Shingen (debatable, IMO militarily Shingen wasn't that great either) but he's certainly not stupid enough to have his cavalry charge bamboo stockades for 6 hours. In any case, again, the attacks would’ve been by mixed formation troops.  \nBasically of Nobunaga's battle plans, all they said was \"ooooo guns\". Guns were important. But they were not new and played only a relatively small, though important, role in the victory.  \n\n&gt;The Uesugi are probably the last truly great clan left in Japan.\n\nBecause the Hojo, Date, Chosokabe, Mori, and Shimazu didn’t exist apparently. And that’s not counting the Oda and Tokugawa.\n\n&gt;Kenshin smashes the Oda forces by releasing the flood gates on a river just as Nobunaga’s men are trying to cross.\n\nUesugi and Oda did not engage in proper campaign when Kenshin was alive. Shibata Katsui (not Nobunaga himself) merely ordered a withdraw when informed that the castle of an ally he was trying to help had fallen, and in the middle of the withdraw Kenshin fell on his rear guard. No damned flood gates.\n\n&gt;This defeat puts the Oda on the defensive.\n\nIt's not even wrong to say the defeat put the Oda on the defensive vs the Uesugi because they didn't really even fight.\n\n&gt;Kenshin is preparing a massive assault on Oda land\n\nOn the Hojo actually.\n\nAnd Episode 5!\n\n&gt;[Hattori Hanzo could have betrayed Tokugawa Ieyasu, but instead leads him through Kogo through secret ninja path, hires ninja to protect Ieyasu, and leads him to safety].\n\nHattori Masanari was not a ninja. Were the Iga group he hired all, or even mostly, ninja? I would say no but I'm willing to let it slide, though even if they were they were not the wall climbing all black ninjitsu guys of fiction. But in any case the main danger on the trip was not Akechi's troops, but ochimushagari, or peasants attacking \"stray/fallen samurai\". Hattori's parents(?) were from Iga, so he was able to use his connections and find local merchants and gave out a tonne of money to local villages to insure safe passage (yes about 200 locals did join, but they being all ninja I think it's safe to call bullshit). And they did have to fight their way through quite a lot (they killed about 200, so recorded). But \"ooooo ninjas\" x3.  \nAnd where’s Kogo? They went through Iga and Ise.\n\n&gt;Mitsuhide was officially Shogun for three days.\n\nNo. And I’m pretty sure this is *not* a source problem.\n\n&gt;[Tokugawa gets] an exemption to serve in Hideyoshi’s army for ten years.\n\nNo because he takes part in the Odawara campaign 4 years later. Ieyasu agreed to be Hideyoshi's ally. So although he didn't take part in the Korea campaign, he did fight for Hideyoshi's army during unification.  \n\nLast episode!\n\n&gt;[Tokugawa Ieyasu’s] wealth is nearly those of the other regents combined.\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu: 2.56 million koku. The other four combined: 3.80 million koku.  \nIs that nearly? I don’t think that’s nearly.\n\n&gt;They whisper their support for the idea of a Japan ruled by a Tokugawa.\n\nNot yet. Whatever Tokugawa’s ambitions were, the Sekigahara campaign was over control of the regency. A large number of daimyos on the Tokugawa’s side at Sekigahara were loyal Toyotomi vassals, they just wanted to remove Ishida Mitsunari from power.\n\n&gt;Ishida Mitsunari wanted to rule Japan.\n\nI think the consensus was he was a loyal vassal afraid of Tokugawa’s growing power. Tokugawa had basically been the one breaking Hideyoshi’s edicts left and right.\n\n&gt;[Ishida Mitsunari plotted to assassinate Tokugawa Ieyasu, but Maeda Toshiie on his death bed instead swore loyalty to Ieyasu]\n\nMaeda Toshiie on his death bed *forced Tokugawa Ieyasu to step down* and withdraw from Kyoto. When Maeda Toshiie was alive, the 5 elders were 4 (Maeda leading) vs Tokugawa. Ieyasu wasn't stupid enough to challenge Maeda Toshiie and Ishida Mitsunari in this situation. Ieyasu was the one to visit Maeda Toshiie, not the other way around. The assassination plot against Ieyasu, if it happened at all, was after Toshiie's death.  \n\n&gt;Ishida ran to Tokugawa Ieyasu and begged for mercy.\n\nFiction. Meiji propaganda to be exact.\n\n&gt;[Siege of Fushimi]Mototada did not ask for reinforcement.\n\nWe don’t know that. But we do know he did get reinforcement. But he screwed up and turned his reinforcement, the Shimazu, to Ishida’s side.\nAnd there’s *way* too much focus was placed on the siege of Fushimi Castle. Though the assault took longer than expected, by its timing it didn't allow Ieyasu to concentrate forces. Ieyasu already had Tokugawa forces concentrated in Edo because he was supposed to go fight the Uesugi. The overall concentration at Akasaka took place over a month after the fall of Fushimi, so no way the delay at Fushimi was what allowed that to happen (heck they could've concentrated at Akasaka sooner. Ieyasu wanted to, he just wanted to wait for his son who never showed up). So the siege just slowed Mitsunari's progress in Mino. On the whole the delay did not make a big impact on the campaign, at least not any more than fighting in other places like Shinano and Shikoku. If anything, due to a communication error on part of the Eastern (Tokugawa) forces, the siege caused the Shimazu with their crack troops to switch sides to the Western (Mori/Mitsunari) forces, which ended up being a personal danger to Ieyasu at Sekigahara. So I have to say overall the siege of Fushimi was a huge minus to the Eastern forces.  \nMore important *by far* was delay for the Eastern side Tokugawa Hidetada's 38k men not arriving at Sekigahara in time (mentioned above) due to the weather and for the Western side, Mori Terumoto (for various reasons) not departing Osaka Castle with his forces. The intricate politics/strategy of the Sekigahara campaign was ignored for far too much focus on Fushimi castle. If they had to choose, they should've mentioned Hidetada and/or Terumoto. But \"ooooo loyal samural\".\n\n&gt;The Tokugawa forces on the south began to give way…So at last [Ishida] signalled a full charge on the now exposed southern flank.\n\nNah. So first of all, proper terminology is Eastern and Western forces, as stated above, because most of them were not anyone else’ vassal after the Toyotomi.  \nTwo, if somebody was beginning to give way, it was Ishida because of weight of numbers. But more likely it’s because Tokugawa moved his forces off Momokubariyama into the battlefield, meaning he was looking to commit his final reserves and Ishida was reacting to that.\n\n&gt;To the sound of a Thundering volley from the Tokugawa arquebusiers, the Kobayakawa troops charged down the hill and slammed into the southern end of the Ishida line.\n\nThe Tokugawa arquebusiers shot at the Kobayakawa troops. And the Kobayakawa troops charged Otani troops of the Western army.\n\nThe “previous siege” that Kobayakawa helped Ishida with was actually the Siege of Fushimi.\n\n&gt;During the Korean campaign years ago, Ishida had accused Kobayakawa of recklessness, and Hideyoshi had taken away much of Kobayakawa’s land based on charge, only to have them later restored when Tokugawa interviewed. \n\nNo. I think this is a source problem. Order had arrived for his recall before the battle where he was supposedly accused of recklessness (though he might not even have participated). So this makes the reason impossible. His lands were “confiscated” most likely because he was high in the line of succession to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In an attempt to secure the succession for Hideyori, Hideyoshi had ordered his nephew to commit seppuku in 1595, and at the same time confiscated Kobayakawa’s Nanpa Province. But in the same year he inherited Chikuzen province. The confiscation of Chikuzen in 1598 was probably just a second attempt at decreasing his power. It was returned to him as part of Hideyoshi’s will.\n\n&gt;Hidetada had a strong military record.\n\nIt’s even acknowledged in official Tokugawa sources that Hidetada’s military record was crap. He probably got the job because his elder brothers died.\n\nAnd so ends the Sengoku Jidai. And onto LIES!\n\n&gt;Theoretically [Miyamoto Musashi] fought at Sekigahara, but there’s a lot of confusion as to his time line and no one know exactly when he lived, to the point that historians date his death to before some other historian date him being born.\n\nComplete bullshit. His given birth date range between 1580 to 1584.  \nAnd of course they not being able to get themselves to admit in the lies that Miyamoto Musashi is a non-issue for the Sengoku because his exploits took place **after the Sengoku ended**. This one cemented my low opinion of their *lies* episode and the series in general. They are supposed to admit what they got wrong, in this case admitting that bringing up Musashi is itself a mistake because he didn't matter. But all they could get themselves to do is gloss over the mistake by mentioning conflicting birth years. It's specifically written the Sekigahara campaign was his first taste at war, making him a teen at 1600.  \nThis is a well known fact that's easy to look up. So either they didn't bother, or they couldn't get themselves to admit mistakes when it's actually important. Either way that means their *lies* episode is worthless.\n\n&gt;[Ishiyama Honganji] is actually the reason Osaka is where it is today.\n\nNo. Osaka is where it is today because it was a good location at a river delta. Before Ishiyama Honganji there was Nanpa city, that was one of many temporary capitals.\n\n&gt;Japan almost certainly had more guns by the end of the Sengoku Jidai than all of Europe did.\n\nJapan almost certainly did not. All of Japan had about 200 000 guns at the end of the Sengoku. Europe had a higher guns ratio in their army. The Spanish Empire alone supposedly had 300 000 men under arms, so I highly doubt the entire of Europe had less than 200 000 guns.\n\n&gt;Takeda Shingen pretty much invented the cavalry charge in Japan and this is pretty much literately true.\n\nIt most certainly is literately false. And why does Takeda Shingen need to import horses when he has Shinano.\n\n&gt;Suneomon\n\nPossibly (IMO probably) Fiction.\n\n&gt;Hanzo’s secret path\n\n*sigh* Just because it’s not a major highway does not mean it’s a secret path. See above. “Ooooo ninja* x4.\n\n&gt;[Tea ceremony exists because of Hideyoshi’s patronage]\n\nNo it has been around for a long time before that. Sen no Rikyuu did not invent it.\n\n&gt;Ishida ran to Tokugawa at Maeda’s funeral and Tokugawa let him go.\n\nDid. Not. Happen.\n\nI also want to mention something super important that they didn't, though this one I won't hold against them. Despite all the drama they tried to create, after the destruction of the Azai and Asakura clans, Oda and gang would have to really screw things up for them to not unify Japan. They were basically fielding twice the amount of troops compared to their enemy *on all fronts*.\n\nSource. Is basically Japanese wiki.\nBut apparently there's an English translation of Shinchokoki, the Chronicles of Oda Nobunaga, if you'd like to read it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/465frn/review_of_the_textbook_the_war_between_the_states/",
        "text": "\nDonald Livingston, professor at Emory and living embodiment of the argument against tenure, wrote  in his approving review of John J. Dwyers' [*The War Between the States:](http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Between-States-Americas/dp/0976822407)[America's Uncivil War*](http://imgur.com/7HATgxM) that \"Partial truths are more dangerous than open falsehoods, as error is more easily concealed and more difficult to uncover.\" Unfortunately, [Dwyer](http://www.johnjdwyer.com/) views this a challenge and not a warning. Dwyer, an archangel of Bad History, extracts real historical facts and shapes them into a his dung heap of a narrative. Behind him, though, is a mountain of research that contradicts his view. To show just how insidious his ability to use (mostly) true facts to create a false history, I’m going to present his words and then rewrite the paragraphs with actual context.\n\nObviously I can't review the whole thing, since the belab-coated nerd brigade refuses to invent a mechanical liver, so let's go with the section called the Black Codes. This is after the war and during the period of Reconstruction. The confederacy has lost, slaves are now free, and no one is quite sure what the new social order will be. It's is one of the most interesting parts of American history. Even though it is now understudied, Reconstruction set the stage for much of the country's future racism. Taking a step back from reconstruction, the way historians wrote about reconstruction in the early 1900's was incredibly racist, and served to justify the then contemporary racial attitudes, Jim Crow, and white supremacy. Those writings about reconstruction, called the Dunning school, is dead in academia. But as you will soon see, the Dunning school is not dunn for good. And if you've ever wondered how the writing of history affects the real world, below's stream of partial truths and open falsehoods is a prime example.\n\n___________\n**[Black Codes](http://imgur.com/a/wGLdK)**\n\n&gt;Southern leaders had no illusions about what the Radical Republicans intended for them. Johnson's lack of concern over black voting rights, as well as another emerging differences he had with the radical majority further hardened their position. The ex-Confederates determined to maintain control of their own state governments - which was what Lincoln had intended - before someone else got hold of them.\n\nShould be:\n\n&gt;Southern leaders had no illusions about what the Radical Republicans intended for them **- namely allowing the newly freed men and women to have political and civil rights **. [President] Johnson's lack of concern over black voting rights **which mirrored the view of most white Southern leaders**, as well as another emerging differences he had with the radical majority further hardened their position [ed. - I really don't know if \"their\" is referring to radical Republicans or Southern Leaders]. The ex-Confederates determined to maintain control of their own state governments - which was what Lincoln had intended**, though he also intended for emancipated slaves to vote before he was shot by an unbending white supremacist** - before ~~someone else~~ **black voters** got hold of them.\n____________\n\nHe continues:\n\n&gt;They also determined to protect themselves and their families from an ominous threat they saw looming with the blacks. Thousands of the latter, especially the still-blue-coated war veterans, remained armed, while huge numbers of white Confederates had lost their weapons. Too, there was not enough food to go around, and they feared losing what they had to blacks. Desperate people commit desperate acts, and now few of these in post war South involved blacks stealing from whites. This further incensed and worried whites because they had rarely seen blacks commit such acts. And increasing numbers of blacks were being promised by an array of Northern officials that they would receive free land and provisions in the \"New South,\" and white southerners knew this.\n\nWhich really means:\n\n&gt;They also determined to protect themselves and their families from an ominous threat they saw looming with the **freed** blacks, **who were now more able to pursue their own happiness**. Thousands of the latter, especially the still-blue-coated war veterans, remained armed,  while huge numbers of white Confederates had lost their weapons **which they were given to secede from the federal government**. **Though, in general white southerners had more and more powerful arms than their black brethren.**  Too, there was not enough food to go around, and they feared losing what they had to blacks. Desperate people commit desperate acts, and now few of these in post war South involved blacks stealing from whites**, which paled in comparison to the violence and theft committed by blacks against whites. And the South was no post-apocalyptic hellscape where roving bands fight over scraps, white southern violence was often politically, and not hunger, based. Whatever the nature,** [these crimes by blacks]  further incensed and worried whites because they had rarely seen blacks commit such acts, **of survival and defiance**. And increasing numbers of blacks were being promised by an array of Northern officials that they would receive free land ** from the men who had stolen lifetimes of their labor on that soil.** and provisions in the \"New South,\" and white southerners knew this **and shuddered the thought of free, compensated, and landed blacks**.\n__________\n\nHe follows this with a more truth-snapping sentences:\n\n&gt;Between July and November 1865, six Southern states established a set of \"Black Codes.\" The object was to define the new place of blacks in these states. With them, the white Southern majority found every way they could to deny the new-freed slaves full citizenship rights. Though less harsh than the later Jim Crow laws, these Black Codes still short-circuited what many in the North, especially the Radicals, intended.\n\nThough really:\n\n&gt;Between July and November 1865, six Southern states established a set of \"Black Codes.\" The object was to define the new place of blacks in these states. With them, the white Southern majority found every way they could to deny the new-freed slaves full citizenship rights. Though **perhaps** less harsh than the later Jim Crow laws, these Black Codes still short-circuited what many in the North, especially the Radicals, **and many in the South too (for we should never forget black people also constitute \"the South)** intended. **Blacks couldn't vote, serve on juries, nor testify in court. They didn't have the same freedom to own guns or even property in some states. Crucially, the newly freed men and women had to sign year-long work contracts with whites or run afoul of \"vagrancy\" laws, imprisoned, and auction to the white person who pays their fine. The only reason these laws could possibly be called less harsh than Jim Crow is because of the brevity of their existence. Congress passed a civil rights act in 1866 that killed the black codes.**\n_______\n\nThen:\n\n&gt;The Black Codes did include some improvements over the previous plight of Southern blacks. For instance they provided access to the courts for them, allowing them to file suit on their own behalf. They also established hiring standards that enabled many former slaves without means and unable to find work, to reconnect with society.\n \nOk. I'm going to take a step back from my gimmick and say *this is all bullshit*. This is not massaging the facts to create a false narrative. This is lying. There were no hiring standards. There was no enabling former slaves to find work. Black Codes were an attempt to use the state to force blacks into low-wage labor situation for the profit of whites and for the maintenance of a neo-slavery  and white supremacy. The only real improvement is that african-americans couldn't be sold and were now legally able to get married and form families which couldn't be broken up.\n____\n\nI'm not going to even touch the last paragraph in the section because it mentions \"vagrancy standards\". Vagrancy standards^standards^standards. [Here is the Mississippi's actual black code](https://www.facinghistory.org/for-educators/educator-resources/readings/mississippi-black-codes-1865)\n\n&gt;All freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, with no lawful employment or business, or found unlawful assembling themselves together, either in the day or night time, and all white persons assembling themselves with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, on terms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication with a freed woman, freed negro or mulatto, shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white man two hundred dollars, and imprisonment at the discretion of the court, the free negro not exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months . . .\n\nIf these are standards, then Jim Crow was a seating  chart.\n_________________\nIf this hasn't ruined your day enough, people pay Dwyer to teach history at Southern Nazarene University. The only bright side of this is that irony can't be weaponized, because we could level cities with his official title - Adjunct Professor of History and *Ethics*.\n\n",

        "title": "Bad rabble-rousing bad history from Alfred Young in \"Liberty Tree: Ordinary People and the American Revolution\"",

        "text": "Alfred Young is a fairly well known historian of the Revolutionary Era. He specializes in doing \"bottom up\" or social history that focuses on the common people, and he's probably best known for his biography of George Robert Twelve Hewes, the shoemaker who participated in the Boston Tea Party and whose caning by John Malcolm resulted in the perhaps the worst tar &amp; fathering in colonial Boston history. \n\nI do find that sometimes he tends to bend towards editorializing too much. His choice of adjectives and adverbs aren't always strictly historical, but nothing to really call out and say \"That's bad history and you should feel bad\". \n\nHowever, today I caught an egregious fact checking error in addition to the usual editorializing. As I was going through some sources to answer [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/45kup0/information_on_joyce_junior/) question in /r/AskHistorians, I read this sentence in Young's book \"Liberty Tree: Ordinary People and the American Revolution\"\n\n&gt;Other crowds taking spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment action also sought out the tree as a symbol of justice. This was especially true of tar-and-feathering crowds, which in Boston were initiated by and drawn mostly from the laboring classes. Early in 1774, the crowd that gave a \"New England jacket\" to the customs informer John Malcolm (after he caned the patriot shoemaker George Robert Twelves Hewes) \"hied him away to liberty-tree,\" as a newspaper put it, as if this had become the obvious thing to do. \"Gentlemen\" argued with the crowd to leave Malcolm to the law, but to no avail with the people who had lost faith in the official system of justice. Sons of Liberty leaders seemed beside themselves to control events: they imperiously announced a fictitious \"Committee on Tarring and Feathering\" headed by \"joyce, jun.\"--the Cromwellian soldier who had captured King Charles I--which alone would authorize such actions.\n\nOk, to start from the top with the bad history in this single paragraph. \n\n* \"Gentlemen\" scare quotes, when Hewes himself was one of the ones who argued with the crowd. \n\n* Stating as fact that the Sons of Liberty were the ones who created Joyce Jun. That's an unknowable, since we actually don't know for sure who Joyce Jun was\n\n* Stating that Joyce Jun was created as a reaction to the mob action against John Malcolm. Problem with this is that Malcolm was tarred &amp; feathered on January 25, 1774. The first handbill bearing the name of Joyce Junior actually appeared on January 15th and then was printed in the following Monday's *Boston Gazette*, dated January 17, 1774. Pretty impressive trick for the Sons of Liberty to have pulled off the trick of creating Joyce Junior to control the mob's actions ahead of time and to not actually control said mob.\n\n[January 17th paper](http://i.imgur.com/mIRTpPs.jpg) (Full paper viewable online at [Massachusetts Historical Society](http://www.masshist.org/dorr/volume/4/sequence/515))\n\nOn January 30th, another handbill went up, which was duly reprinted in the *Boston Gazette* the following morning. It disavowed the attack against Malcolm.\n\n[January 30th paper](http://i.imgur.com/RQ3Y2Sx.jpg) (Full paper viewable online at [Massachusetts Historical Society](http://www.masshist.org/dorr/volume/4/sequence/523)",

        "text": "I love Facebook memes. They're glorious sources of bad history. Take [this meme](http://i.imgur.com/ORQX6Pz.jpg), for instance, purporting to show the time that Winston Churchill sent in tanks to quell a worker's strike in Glasgow. Indeed, this particular picture is being used to talk about the Trongate in sources somewhat more reputable than Facebook, like the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7859192.stm). The picture, needless to say, is being a bit inaccurately used.\n\nTo be clear, the event that the picture is supposedly depicting is not a happy one. 31 January, 1919 was one of the bloodiest and most brutal riots in Glaswegian history, and yes, soldiers were sent to the city. On 27 January, workers in Glasgow began to strike for a 40 hour workweek, a demand they'd increased from their previous demand of a 30 hour workweek. By 31 January, more than 60 000 workers had joined in the strike, bringing the city to a standstill. This culminated in a meeting in the centre of the city, George Square, which - in typical Glaswegian fashion - quickly broke out in a fight between police and strikers. Bottles were thrown, trams were derailed, and people were injured. \n\nIn response to this, the British government, recognising that the Glaswegian police were getting nowhere in quelling the riot, deployed 10 000 soldiers equipped with howitzers, machine guns, and yes, tanks to Glasgow to restore order. However, these soldiers didn't arrive in Glasgow until the day after the battle in George Square, and the tanks never made it out of the railway stations. Rather, armed soldiers with machine guns patrolled the streets and other sensitive areas of the city, and howitzers were set up around the city centre. Tanks, however, never rolled through the Trongate. This is not to say it was a happy occasion for anyone involved - though the striking workers did sort of succeed in that they got a guaranteed 47 hour workweek - but the tanks never made it to the Trongate.\n\nSo what is this picture, then, and why is it so widely used? After all, it is a picture of British troops and their tank marching through what is clearly Glasgow. What's the story of this picture if not something brutal and violent?\n\nLadies and gentlemen, meet [Julian](http://www.edinburghs-war.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/field/image/Brechin%20Tank.jpg). Julian was one of six tanks that toured the UK during WWI to drum up sales of war bonds and enthusiasm for the war. Julian rolled into Glasgow on 14 January 1918 and stayed for a week or so before rolling on to Dundee, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen (which you can see in [this video](http://movingimage.nls.uk/film/1238B)). During this time, there was a tank-themed festival throughout the city, with Julian as the centerpiece (indeed, in [this bigger picture of Julian](http://i.imgur.com/HEBIXjv.jpg) you can clearly see the 113 that marks the tank as Julian). Over the course of the festival, Glasgow set a record for war bonds sales, selling more than London, Manchester, and Birmingham combined (a total of more than £14 million worth of war bonds). It's a bit of a far cry from the story of the tank rolling through the Trongate to put down a riot. \n\nIt's important to remember that the story of workers' rights isn't a peaceful one, but at the same time, it's also important not to misappropriate history to do so. This particular image is actually a rather a happy one, with people enjoying the novelty of a tank. The fact that there would be less happy tanks in the city a year later shouldn't be forgotten either, but this particular image isn't of that. This is a picture of Julian and the week that Glasgow spent  £14 million pounds to support the British war effort.\n\nSources!\n\n[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/IupXbOh.jpg) a picture of the tanks that were sent to Glasgow in 1919, in case anyone's curious. You may observe that those are, in fact, a completely different kind of tank (Julian was a Mark IV, and these are Medium mark Cs)(please don't ask follow-up questions about tanks). \n\nI know I knocked it earlier, but [the BBC really isn't all that bad when it comes to WWI stories](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p022tvtk).\n\n[A source about the riot in George Square](http://sites.scran.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyde/rceve14.htm)\n\n[Another picture of Julian](http://i.imgur.com/wqLRIFt.jpg) because those never get old.\n\n[Relevant musical accompaniment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hamKl-su8PE)",

I would love to take a trip to Cuba and see how it is now, before it gets completely westernized (inevitably, probably) and then go back in like 10,15,20 years or so and notice the difference. It will be very interesting to see exactly how Cuba develops as its own entity, we really haven't had any kind of equivalent for this situation. I assume future generations will view Cuba as a case study for this reason. Again, it'll be really intriguing to see how thes plays out and what kind of society/government/culture/people come out of it in the long run.](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/45g5rs/us_to_restore_commercial_air_travel_to_cuba/czxlo80)\n\nWithout going into R2 too much, the notion that there's never been something like Cuba is pretty easy to discredit. Since the Industrial Revolution, *lots* and *lots* of countries have gone from being relatively closed off (even more so than Cuba) to relatively open.\n\n**Japan, 1854**\n\n&gt;On March 31, 1854, the Convention of Kanagawa (Japanese: 日米和親条約 Hepburn: Nichibei Washin Jōyaku?, \"Japan–US Treaty of Peace and Amity\") or Kanagawa Treaty (神奈川条約 Kanagawa Jōyaku?) was the first treaty between the United States of America, and the Empire of Japan, then under the administration of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Signed under threat of force, it effectively meant the end of Japan’s 220-year-old policy of national seclusion (sakoku), by opening the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa\n\n**Korea, 1880s-1890s**\n\nHermit kingdom is a term applied to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world. The Joseon dynasty of Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom during the latter part of the dynasty.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_kingdom\n\n&gt;Korea maintained an isolationist policy until the 1880s. The Treaty of Kanghwa (1876), concluded at the insistence of Japan, defined Korea as an independent state and led to the establishment of diplomatic relations with not only Japan but also China.\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/topic/Choson-dynasty\n\n**Bhutan, 1974**\n\n&gt;Tourism in Bhutan began in 1974, when the Government of Bhutan, in an effort to raise revenue and to promote the country's unique culture and traditions to the outside world, opened its isolated country to foreigners. In 1974, 287 tourists visited Bhutan. Since then the number of tourists visiting Bhutan has increased to 2,850 in 1992, rising dramatically to 7,158 in 1999\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Bhutan\n\n**Tibet, 1904**\n\n&gt;Tibet's self-imposed seclusion in the 1800s prompted a wave of Western explorers and would-be colonizers to head for Lhasa. In 1904, British soldiers brutally tore up Tibet in search of Russian influence; the region's very isolation \"had led the British to fill the void with their imaginings,\" Wong writes.\n\nhttp://www.newser.com/story/53398/tibets-long-history-of-isolation.html\n\n**Paraguay, 1814-1840**\n\n&gt;Just after independence was achieved, Paraguay was governed from 1814 by the dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who closed the country's borders and prohibited trade or any relation with the outside world until his death in 1840. The Spanish settlers who had arrived just before independence had to intermarry with either the old colonists or with the native Guarani, in order to create a single Paraguayan people.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism#Isolationism_by_country\n\nObviously the details differ somewhat, but each of these scenarios are countries that were as isolated, if not more so, from the rest of the world than present-day Cuba. Maybe Cuba in some ways is more attractive or more interesting to some (either its beauty, the old cars, the tourist potential, or -- for Americans -- the idea of a forbidden fruit), but there is nothing special or unique about it. Also, [the equation of Western civilization with American culture and the implication that areas that aren't under massive American corporate influence are \"not Westernized\" made me facepalm, although that has been R5d to death already.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3rankj/the_history_of_northern_europe_according_to_a/)\n\n*I could come up with even more examples, including most of Central and Eastern Europe as well as Vietnam, but all of those would violate R2.\n\ned: fecked up a citation",

        "text": "www.historyextra.com/article/premium/vikings-land-without-kings\n\nThis is the offending article, published on the 29th January 2016, and written by Mr. Philip Parker who is apparently a:\n\n&gt;writer and historian specialising in late antiquity and early medieval Europe\n\nYeah well we'll see about that one...\n\nN.B. the writer of the article has no citations in any academic journal, and as such referring to him as a 'specialist', when experts in the field of Saga Age Iceland such as Jesse Byock could have been asked is frankly laughable.\n\nThe first thing wrong with this article is the title:\n\n&gt;Vikings: A land without kings\n\nWhilst it is correct that the land that became known as Iceland was settled by Vikings from Scandinavia, the use of the term 'Viking' after the settlement period is inappropriate as the inhabitants of Iceland did not engage in Viking activity (sea-based raiding and trading), due to the relative lack of wood in Iceland compared with Scandinavia for the purposes of ship-building after the end of the settlement period.\n\n&gt;Using the Faroe Islands as a stepping stone, the Vikings could reduce the risks of long voyages across the open waters of the Atlantic. By the 830s a territory in the North Atlantic had been discovered by pioneers including Flóki Vilgerðarson, who dubbed it Ísland (Iceland), in memory of the chilly winter he spent there.\n\nA few unforgivable mistakes here. The first is that seafaring Scandinavians did not need to use the Faroes as a stepping stone in order to traverse the North Atlantic, ships such as the Knarr were perfectly capable of traversing the open ocean safely. The second is the reference to Flóki's date of arrival in Iceland, which is simply not as clear-cut as the '830s'. Further to this, the author makes no reference to any source such as Landnámabók to support this claim, or even ventures a discussion over the reliability (or rather unreliability) of the Icelandic sources that he cites later. Finally, Landnámabók states (had he used that as a source) that Flóki named Iceland as 'Ísland' after seeing huge amounts of ice (presumably the Vatnajökull glacier, which is fucking huge) in Iceland, and not after spending as our dear friend Phil puts: a 'chilly winter there'. There is also no reference to the Irish monks (Papar) that may have been living in Iceland prior to Scandinavian exploration/settlement, but which are referenced in primary sources such as Landnámabók that our good friend Phil clearly hasn't read.\n\n&gt;However, these were strictly exploratory voyages. The first successful colonising expedition arrived later, in AD 874, led by the Norwegian Ingólf Arnarson. The following decades saw streams of settlers from Norway and the Viking colonies in the British Isles arrive in a great landnám (‘taking of the land’), and within 60 years almost all of the available territory had been claimed.\n\nNo reference to genetic studies on the make-up of the settlers (women were predominantly British/Irish, whilst the men were predominantly Scandinavian), no source given for the settlement date, settlement date not that accurate as would have been indicated from even consulting more than one secondary source, no reference to the landnám-tephra in arguing in favour of the proposed settlement date. Poor effort, see me.\n\n&gt;Free from the direct control of the distant Norwegian monarchs, who were much too preoccupied with their own struggles against rival magnates to interfere with the new colony, the Icelandic Vikings were able to dispense with the authority of kings. Left to their own devices for three centuries, they created a unique form of society that came to be known as the ‘Icelandic Commonwealth’.\n\nThe term 'monarchs' implies that the Scandinavian ethnic groups were coherent states during the 9th century, they were not. The Icelanders were also certainly not left to their own devices for three centuries, Scandinavian **rulers** attempted to extend their influence to Iceland throughout the period (for example during the Christianisation [circa 1000 CE], which Big Phil refers to in this very same article a few lines later).\n\n&gt;Much about Iceland was familiar to the settlers: it was indented with fjords, at the heads of which they could establish farms. Yet it was not as fertile as the Scandinavian lands they had left behind. Much of the interior was uninhabitable, studded with volcanoes and covered with great glaciers such as the Vatnajökull, and too cold for much of each year to support agriculture.\n\nActually, one of the benefits of Iceland was that they were able to use similar farming techniques during the settlement period to those that they had used back in Scandinavia. That could have been one of the reasons why it was such an attractive prospect to move there in the first place.\n\n&gt;These settlers lived at the edge of subsistence, and a cold or wet summer could lead to famine. Population density was low: Iceland’s first census, taken in 1106, counted 4,560 free farmers, which probably equates to a total population of around 10 times that number. Settlements comprised farms clustered around the longhouses of local chieftains. Farms were constructed largely with turf, and within them families cooked, ate and slept in a single long room. This way of life bred a fierce independence. The Icelandic sagas tell that the original colonisers of Iceland fled the tyranny of the Norwegian king Harald Finehair. Though several of his successors planned to force the colony's obedience to the crown, the difficulties of launching such a venture to a far-flung island meant that nothing came of the idea for almost 300 years.\n\nNo real problems with the first bit. However, '[this] way of life bred a fierce independence' - no, the 19th century independence movement which romanticised the Commonwealth period did that. Also, i'm fairly sure that the cold doesn't influence political inclinations. Also, the last sentence, wtf u taken Phil...\n\n&gt;With no threat of invasion, there was little need to establish a central tax-raising authority to fund defence, and no Icelandic king arose to challenge his Norwegian counterpart.\n\nYes, because the first thought of subsistence farmers constantly nearing starvation is to establish a tax-raising authority for defence. Moreover, someone is definitely going to want to invade and resettle a land where there are virtually no valuable exports except for cloth. Get your shit together Phil.\n\n&gt;Instead, power devolved to the level of local chieftains called gooar. There were 39 of these, spread across the four quarters (or várthing) into which Iceland came to be divided. But the gooar did not rule territorial domains in the manner of European feudal aristocrats; rather, their authority rested on the allegiance of retainers (or thingmenn) whose lands often intermingled with those owing loyalty to other gooar. If a thingmann found himself at odds with his chieftain, he could transfer his loyalty to another by declaring himself ‘out of thing’ with the first.\n\nSo much wrong with this paragraph I don't even know where to start. The first is that our good friend Phil has misspelt the Old Norse term for chieftain-priest as 'gooar' - it should be rendered as 'godar' (where the 'd' is replaced for the 'eth' character). Secondly, the number of chieftaincies was not as clear-cut as being 39, it fluctuated over the course of the Commonwealth period, and eventually was condensed into the hands of a few families (an event you mention later in your same article, logically inconsistent much). Thirdly, the Old Norse term 'várthing' does not refer to the quarters, it refers to the local assembly held in Spring. Understandable, as Wikipedia (which was clearly your main source for this article) makes the same mistake you do. Finally, Phil's rendering of 'thingmann' is wrong for the singular of 'thingmenn' - should be rendered as 'thingmadr' (where the d is an 'eth'). Either use the English or use the Old Norse, don't mix them up.\n\n&gt;This early period of ‘taking of the land’ is described in the Landnámabók, a 13th-century compilation of earlier sources, which details the names, ancestry and notable deeds of the first settlers in each district.\n\nDid you even read it tho Phil?\n\n&gt;Once this initial phase of settlement was over, territorial disputes inevitably erupted. **The danger of uncontrollable feuds prompted the settlers to formalise what had, until then, been a somewhat haphazard political system** – and so, in AD 930, they established the Althing: the first pan-Icelandic assembly.\n\nLol. Read a saga, any saga, and you will see how false this statement is RE: uncontrollable feuds.\n\n&gt;The requirement for all the gooar to attend meant that, though feuds – often bloody – did arise, the Althing acted as a safety valve, a neutral arena where settlements could be negotiated before conflict got out of hand.\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt;By the 12th century, Icelandic society had begun to change, swayed by external nfluences – most notably Christianity. Missionaries had earlier attempted to preach in Iceland, though with little success until a concerted effort by the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason led Thorgeir Thorkelsson, the lawspeaker of the Althing, to declare in AD 1000 that Iceland should be Christian.\n\nBit of logical inconsistency in that para.\n\n&gt;From the late 12th century, Iceland was riven by civil wars, characterised by large- scale pitched battles quite unlike earlier feuds.\n\nUse of modern political terminology inappropriate for a proto-state.\n\n&gt;Loose alliances coalesced around two powerful families, the Oddi and the Sturlungar. The latter had close ties with the royal family of Norway, whose authority had grown far stronger in the previous three centuries and now had the resources to meddle in the Icelandic civil wars.\n\nMassive oversimplification - Google the 'Age of Sturlungs' to see truly how complex this period was. Also, Oddi is a place-name not a family name. If we were doing place-names big Phil would have had to render it as 'the people of Hvamm' and 'the people of Oddi'.\n\nI can't deal with the rest of the article, but you can safely assume that the rest of it contains similar errors. I also likely missed a few mistakes this guy has made in this article.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\nJ. Byock, *Viking Age Iceland*\n\nW.

        "text": "It's the 8th of December 1914. The German East Asian Squadron, commanded by Admiral von Spee has just crossed the Pacific ocean, seeking to avoid the Allied control of the oceans, and return to Germany. They've defeated a British squadron under Admiral Craddock off Coronel in Chile, and are now approaching the Falkland Islands, hoping to destroy the British coaling station there. Unfortunately for them, the Falkland Islands are better defended then they think. A strong British squadron, including two battle cruisers, and commanded by the excellently named Doveton Sturdee, had arrived at Port Stanley the day before, having been despatched as a result of the defeat at Coronel. Von Spee retreats, but the faster and better-armed British battlecruisers are able to chase down and destroy his two armoured cruisers, while the remainder of the British squadron hunts his light cruisers. While doing so, the British battlecruisers fire off nearly their entire ammunition stocks, whilst scoring only a few hits. Why this terrible accuracy?\n\nIf you're Neil deGrasse Tyson, writing [here](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1995/03/01/the-coriolis-force) for the Natural History Magazine, the answer is, at least in part, the Coriolis force:\n\n&gt;But in 1914, from the annals of embarrassing military moments, there was a World War I naval battle between the English and the Germans near the Falklands Islands off Argentina (52 degrees south latitude). The English battle cruisers *Invincible* and *Inflexible* engaged the German war ships *Gneisenau* and *Scharnhorst* at a range of nearly ten miles. Among other gunnery problems encountered, the English forgot to reverse the direction of their Coriolis correction. Their tables had been calculated for northern hemisphere projectiles, so they missed their targets by even more than if no correction had been applied. They ultimately won the battle against the Germans with about sixty direct hits, but it was not before over a thousand missile shells had fallen in the ocean.\n\nWhile this is a great story, it's quite inaccurate. Firstly, British battlecruiser gunnery at the Falklands was better than their accuracy in the Northern Hemisphere. I'm somewhat uncertain about deGrasse Tyson's numbers for hits - as her entire crew was lost, we don't have good hit estimates for *Scharnhorst*, but about 50 12in hits were scored on *Gneisenau*. It doesn't seem likely that only 10 hits were achieved on *Scharnhorst*, given reports of the destruction wreaked aboard her by the British ships, so the hit rate was likely closer to 75-100 hits for 1000+ shells fired. Even if we take deGrasse Tyson's 60 hits as a given, it's still a better hit rate than achieved in the North Sea. For example, at Dogger Bank, the British battlecruiser hit rate against their German counterparts was closer to 2%, compared to the 6% he claims for the Falklands. Even the Germans didn't do that much better at Dogger Bank - their hit rate was 3.5%. At Jutland the hit rate was closer to that claimed for the Falklands, roughly 5%. However, part of the reason for the poor accuracy in the North Sea battles was that they were fought at longer ranges than the Falklands, though this was somewhat compensated for by improved fire control equipment.\n\nSecondly, the British didn't use pre-calculated tables to control their fire at the Falklands, as deGrasse Tyson seems to imply. The main British fire-control system of WW1 was called the Dreyer Table, but this wasn't a table of numbers. Instead, it was an early electro-mechanical computer, which took in a whole heap of inputs, including your speed and course, and that of your target, and spat out a firing solution. This was a quite primitive system, and didn't take into account the Coriolis force at all. However, any discussion of the Dreyer Table isn't really relevant to the Falklands. Neither British battlecruiser had a working Dreyer Table aboard. Instead, they used salvo firing to direct fire onto the target. This was a technique where the ship's armament was fired at the target sequentially. The fall of shot from the first shells to land were used to adjust the aim for the next guns to fire. If the shells fell short, the range would be increased. If they fell past the target, the range was reduced. Once the target was straddled - shells from the same salve fell over and short simultaneously - the ships would switch to full broadside fire. This technique basically ignores the Coriolis effect, which is a constant, systematic effect for ships steaming on a constant bearing (as they did at the Falklands). It's also worth remembering that the RN ships had been carrying out gunnery practice the day before the battle, from which any effect on gunnery from incorrect calculation of the Coriolis effect would have been noted and corrected for during the battle.\n\nFinally, the other issues with gunnery absolutely dwarfed the Coriolis effect at the Falklands.  Commander Dannreuther, the Gunnery Officer for *Invincible*, wrote in his report on the battle:\n\n&gt;Primary Control from Fore Top was used throughout. At times the control was very difficult as we were firing down wind the whole time and the view from aloft was much interfered with by gun smoke and funnel smoke\nRange Finders were of little use and any form of range finder plotting was impossible owing to the difficulty of observation and high range. In fact as far as this particular action was concerned it would have made no difference if the ship had not had a single Range Finder or Dumaresq or any plotting outfit on board\n\n&gt;During the latter part of the action with the Gneisenau (she) continually zig-zagged to try to avoid being hit, altering course every few minutes about two points either side of her normal course. This alteration of course could not be detected by Range Finder or by eye and continual spotting corrections were necessary. The rate being fairly high and changing every few minutes from opening to closing I found the only effective means was to keep the rate at zero and continually spot on the target. By this means we managed to hit her now and again.\n\nThe Falklands were, for the Royal Navy, proof that its peacetime assumptions about gunnery were completely false, and that its peacetime gunnery practices hadn't adequately prepared it for wartime engagements.The battle was fought at ranges far beyond what the RN expected to engage at, with British rangefinders proving insufficient for the task. Gunnery practice in peacetime was carried out at low speed. High speeds introduced serious gunnery problems. The vibrations from the ship's engines shook rangefinders, making them even less useful. The coal-fired ships produced serious amounts of smoke when steaming at top speed. Aboard *Invincible*, only her A turret had an uninterrupted view of the German ships, with the remainder of her turrets, and her foretop only catching intermittent glances. As Dannreuther notes, this had a significant effect on his ability to direct fire.  The trailing *Inflexible* had even worse problems, as she had to deal not only with her own smoke, but that of *Invincible*. The British had assumed that, like them, the Germans would not zig-zag in order to obtain the best possible firing solution. As it happened, the Germans did take such evasive action, spoiling the British gunnery. In at least one case, shells missed completely because the spotters mistook the bow and stern of one of the German cruisers, causing shells to fall far behind her. All of these problems were so much bigger than the Coriolis effect at the battle - scatter due to the Coriolis effect was only ~15-30m. These effects were causing scatters in the region of hundreds of meters. \n\nSources:\n\n*Fighting the Great War at Sea: Strategy, Tactics and Technology*, Norman Friedman, Seaforth, 2014\n\n*Naval Firepower: Battleship Guns and Gunnery in the Dreadnought Era*, Norman Friedman, Seaforth, 2014\n\n*Castles of Steel*, Robert K.
