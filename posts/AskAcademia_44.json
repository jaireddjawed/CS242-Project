        "text": "Hello everyone. I apologize for the length! \n\nI'm currently in my final weeks of graduate school before I complete my program as a summer graduate. It is a non-thesis based program but it does require an End of Program exam. The issue is that my professor assigned a WF, even after telling her what was going on in my life (except the marital issues... only said I was moving) during a time when she could still assign a W. I actually don't need the class to fulfill any requirements; I solely registered for it because I felt I could someday apply it in my career. \n\nHere is the timeline:\n\nThe exam opened on a Friday (June 8) and it was due the following Friday (June 15). My 5 week summer course started June 4th. I had reached out to the professor immediately and informed her I would be taking the exam and if I could have an extension on the first assignment and would turn it in the week of the 18th (silly me, how could I complete an assignment in two days when she gave three weeks...)\n\nThe end of program exam does not allow any extra time to do absolutely anything. I didn't walk out of mom's house the entire week. \n\nHere are the other issues: \n\nMy best friend died on May 29th and his services were on June 4th and June 5th. It was a very traumatic and shocking death for us all that left us with many questions. \n\nI was also moving out of my apartment the same week and back into my old room at my mom's due to marital issues. I had to be out by the 6th and couldn't due to attending my friend's services, so I had to pay for an extra day and completely move out by the 7th. \n\nMy exam started the next day, June 8th. \n\nThis isn't all of it. My cousin, who is like a brother to me, was fighting for his life in the hospital after having several cardiac arrests. He decided to end end his life on June 7th, which ultimately ended up being a mistake on behalf the social workers who went to talk to him. While he was on a ventilator, he could still \"talk\" and was in good spirits, he just couldn't breathe on his own. So I went to say goodbye June 6th, which is why I couldn't move out that day either. The doctor refused to disconnect him on the 7th. I was glad because I could take my exam starting the next day and not have to cancel it due to funeral services. \n\nI was so mentally exhausted from the exam that I figured I could try to complete the first assignment that was due on the 18th by the end of the week. I took the weekend to read the material we were assigned over the course of three weeks. I had already started writing a part of my assignment. I had just sat down on June 20th to try to belt out the rest of the assignment when my aunt called in hysterics that my cousin had \"died\".\n\nMy cousin ended up being discharged to a long-term foster care home on June 21st and \"died\" within 45 minutes of arriving because someone forgot to pack a suctioning tube they used for his trach. \n\nI say \"died\" because he technically did and the foster care lady told us he did. I feel the need to mention that since I moved in with my mom (and growing up there too), a lot of responsibility for our elders fall on me and my sister. We drive them (my mom and my aunt, my cousin's mom, uncles, etc.) to doctor's appointments, I drive them at night because they can't see... I drive them everywhere. I had literally just sat down to complete my assignment when my aunt called in hysterics that my cousin had died. It's nighttime, so my mom screamed at her that she would be right there to pick her up to take her to the hospital... so the entire time, we're under the impression he's gone.\n\nWe arrive to the hospital to find out they had revived him, despite having a DNR bracelet. So then came the tests to check if he had any brain activity. He had no oxygen for 40 minutes, which left him brain dead. Then came the decision to disconnect him... so as soon as that decision was made, I emailed my professor that I was dropping the class, along with most of what I mentioned here, extremely condensed and not as detailed. We were at the hospital until he passed at around 12:30/1AM, June 21st.\n\nDid I mention I started my internship the 18th? I didn't. \n\nMy question is... I don't want my GPA to be a 3.53. Is it worth appealing the grade? I technically did not turn in any assignments. I am considering furthering my education in the near future and don't want my GPA to affect my admission.\n\nTL;DR - I had a couple of deaths in the family, my marriage fell apart, I had to move, had to take a final exam, had assignments, and an internship. Informed professor about what was happening, dropped the class and professor assigned a WF (withdraw fail) instead of a W. ",

My goal is to pursue a PhD and enter a research/academia career. Firstly, I'd like to know if I have a shot at getting accepted in to a good PhD program. I have an associate's degree in general studies from the Community College of Baltimore County (GPA: 3.82). My current GPA at UMD is a 3.6. This fall I will be starting as a Research Assistant at UMD running psychological tasks on rats. This fall I will also potentially be part of a program that assists transfer students in the School of Psychology to transition to University life. Besides these two things I do not have much extra-curricular experience. I have 3 years work-experience at an assisted-living facility as a Diet Aide. My main interests in Psychology are social and behavioral. I figure that I have three main choices moving forward:\n1. Peruse a PhD directly after my BA\n2. Peruse a Master's degree directly after my BA\n3. Gain more lab experience after my BA so I will have a better chance being accepted in to a PhD program\nWhich of these options would you consider most sensible/are there any other options I haven't thought about?

        "text": "Hey r/AskAcademia, I'm looking for either feedback or personal anecdotes from others who have navigated the so-called 'two-body problem' of academic relationships.\n\nI've just finished my PhD (Earth Sciences) and I've been looking into postdocs. My wife (also Earth Sciences, different subfield) has just started her PhD at the same university where I'm currently enrolled. However, we live in a small country where postdoc opportunities are exceedingly rare. I've tried talking to other academics within my network (e.g., at universities within the country) but so far I haven't heard of any funding for potential postdocs in my field. \n\nNot wanting to lose out on the opportunity to do research, I've started applying for postdocs overseas. I've contacted a few researchers in my field, and have found someone who may be interested in having me on as a postdoc. I haven't talked to said researcher about my situation as-of-yet, I'm still in the early stages of talks about the research, career expectations, etc. \n\nTaking this position, of course, would necessitate me to move overseas away from my wife. We have talked a little bit about this, but I don't think either of us can really gauge how difficult one of us moving away would be.\n\nAt the same time, I've recently had a job offer from a local consulting agency. The work they do is vaguely in line with my skills, but would offer no opportunity to continue on in research. It's a difficult problem- do I abandon my dreams of becoming a research scientist for, essentially, comfortability? I guess I am worried that if I were to take the consulting job, I'd feel like I didn't live up to my potential. Maybe that thought is derivative of a sunk-cost fallacy; I'm not sure.\n\nI know reddit can't solve this dilemma for me, but if anyone has any insight, or experiences they can share, I'd appreciate hearing them.\n",

The literature we referenced is very relevant content-wise and they did good work, but I'm fairly sure the reviewer didn't read those papers and at first glance thought that since the names were not part of the designated-famous-names-list of the field that their work must not be credible. \n\nIt sort of makes me wonder about how my papers are perceived when someone references them, and also reminds me how there's an in-crowd of names in every field and working from outside of them makes it a lot harder to gain traction.\n",

I did not have a lot of molecular biology experience, so I took up this job where I do a lot of stem cell research in neuroscience. I have 2 years of experience being a TA, a great letter from my master's PI, a GPA of 3.88. I am VERY good at cell culture, electron microscopy, tissue engineering, microscopy, FACS, MACS, RNA Isolation, ELISA, IF, cryosectioning, confocal and fluorescence microscopy, stem cell research, iPS differentiations and other generic assays like protein quantification etc. \n\nQuestions: 1. My ideal target lab for my PhD would be one that combines tissue engineering with neuroscience - but I don't know what kind of programs I should apply to, because there are very few labs that do that, and I don't know how to articulate that into my essays. Can someone help me with this? \n\n2. Also, I would like to go to school where my boyfriend (who is into computer science) will also have good opportunities in the area.

        "text": "Long story but I'll try to be brief:\n\n I've been obsessed with statistics, machine learning, and programming (to an extent) throughout my undergrad career. I've always wanted to use these skills in a research setting, possibly building AI to contribute to cancer research. My science background is minimal so I was hoping to pick up on that in graduate school or in free time. But anyways, for only 3 years, I've been taking an overwhelming majority of stats, math, and CS courses (haven't had more than 1 non-math related course in a semester since my first semester of college. I've done an REU in genomics, worked in a ecology lab, and now I'm gearing up to work in a lab that does amazing stuff with AI and ML in cancer research. My goal has always been to attend a PhD program right after I graduate, so I threw in GRE prep as well. I should also mention that I kind of used my free time watching tutorials on machine learning, algorithms, data structures, statistics, and even some of the biology stuff on YouTube. But recently, more specifically midway during this summer after starting my internship (while still trying to handle the stuff mentioned above), something just snapped. \n\nI'm about two months away from needing to take the GRE and haven't studied in months or even registered. I feel excitement about my upcoming lab work, so much that I asked the PI to send me papers about the background material so I could read up on it over the summer. But every time I go to do anything related to my research, or learning more about stats and CS, I find myself just getting bored, or thinking of something else I want to read up on and abandon my task with little to no resistance. I've always had a sort of short attention span, but recently I feel like I can't stay super excited about anything related to my work at all for longer than 10-15 minutes. \n\nShould I be worried about this? I'm kind of panicking that I wasted the last four years of my life thinking I loved something that I really didn't? Like I still can't imagine myself being happy doing anything else, but recently not having the super strong work ethic and motivation I've always had has kind of scared me into thinking the passion I had won't ever return. Some of my close friends have suggested that I take a gap year before grad school, or at the minimum, just don't do any extra stuff for the rest of summer.\n\nIf any of you guys have been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear any advice or feedback! I'm actually super confused right now and don't know if I should keep pushing myself until I snap out of this funk.\n\nThanks!\n\n**TLDR**: I feel like I've lost my passion for my research interests right before applying to graduate school. Some of my close friends don't think the passion is gone, but rather I'm burnt out and just need to take a break. Should I be worried about this happening so close to when I intended to apply to PhD programs? Is it normal to go through this kind of thing?",

        "text": "**TLDR: I am about to start my PhD in September but I don't know if I want to anymore. I keep thinking back about an offer for a PhD I declined two months ago and am wondering if it's worth it to drop the project I haven't even started yet and see if I could get a second chance with Prof from the PhD position I previously declined.** \n\nFull story: \n\nTwo months ago when I interviewed for the PhD I am about to start (PhD A), I also had an interview for PhD B. I was offered both of them, had a really hard time making a decision and haven't handled the process gracefully - I expressed my interest for PhD B after we agreed I would let them know how I feel about the position, then did a complete 180 and told them I changed my mind and would pick PhD A after all.   \n\nThe one I ended up picking, PhD A, is less aligned with my previous interests, but the topic seemed cool, I got a bit into the literature on it, had nice discussions with future advisors about problems in the field. I applied for this one mostly out of curiosity, but also because I was starting to feel desperate about my PhD search - I was applying for PhDs for almost a year and had no success other than landing two Skype interviews, so I was happy when I was invited for an on-site interview after a nice Skype chat. Things were finally happening and I didn't think much about what initially drove me to applying for PhDs. When they gave me an offer two days after my meeting with them, I was just stoked to get a PhD with people who seemed would be good advisors, in a cool city, and with a nice paycheck. I thought even though the topic is kinda out of my field of interests, I would grow to like it and everything would be great.\n\nIn the time between my Skype interview with advisors from PhD A and meeting them in person, I got invited for an interview for PhD B. This one was a collaboration between a pharma company and a university, and it happened that it was the same university where PhD A was too. I had a phone interview with pharma people and I mentioned that I would be in that city for another interview. They invited me for an interview at their company and also arranged for me to meet with the Prof who is the supervisor on the project, even though he initially wasn't going to be part of the interview process. Both pharma people and Prof knew I was also interviewing for PhD A.\n\nThe topic of PhD B was right at the core of my interests, but I was worried about several aspects of it - first, the pharma company is in a different country, and the project would involve dividing my time between the company and the university. It wasn't fixed how much time I would need to spend in each, just that I would need to show some flexibility and move depending on the course the experiments are taking. I might be a bit too spoiled, but I wasn't keen on moving back and forth between places that are 500 km apart a couple of times in 3 years. The second thing was funding - again, I guess I am spoiled, but this project was a scholarship-funded, bursary type PhD, which is unusual for the EU country where the university is and where PhDs are seen as normal jobs with a salary and social security. I dug up some university newspaper stating that this type of funding was being set-up as a pilot project in this exact university, while other universities in the country would not follow suit and think the practice is unfair. Some students who already participate in the pilot with their PhDs said the financing is chaotic, they pay taxes while still being considered students, not having a secured spot and computer in the office, blah blah. Reading this made me really worried.\n\nWhen it was time to make my decision, the time pressure and chaos that came with it made me short-circuit and I simply chose the easy way out with PhD A, with its cushy benefits, thinking I would eventually grow to like the topic and forget about my previous interests.  \n\nIt's been almost two months since then and I've been asking myself whether I have made a wrong decision every single day. The two things I regret most about not choosing PhD B are 1) with PhD B, I would have been part of the research community I wanted to be part of since my Bachelors. I would attend the conferences I was looking forward to attend, see my old lab mates from my internships, and just read about cool research which isn't necessarily tied to mine, but I nevertheless love to know more about. With PhD A, even if I think my project is neat, it's part of a narrowly focused community and I don't care too much about the research they're doing. 2) the Prof from PhD B just seemed like a really cool guy. He's doing great work not only with his research but also with collaborations outside of his area of expertise. Also, his students say his door is always open and that he always finds time for discussions, even if his schedule is constantly packed. I would have preferred him more compared to advisors from PhD A, even though they seem pretty cool too.\n\nI expect people to tell me to not start PhD A when I'm not passionate about the project, and I'm thinking about doing that and getting some kind of random job before I figure out what I *really* want out of a PhD. I just don't know what to tell my advisors.\n\n**But I would like some outside perspective on another idea that's on my mind - if I were to email Prof from PhD B asking if he's taking new PhD students next year... is it reasonable to at least hope he would consider giving me a second chance? What would I even tell him?**  \n\nI realize he probably doesn't feel too favorably about me after I first said yes to his pharma colleagues and then changed my mind (I assume they told him about it?). Another thing that's an issue for me here is my skill level - he is head of a big lab, and students are expected to be pretty independent from the start. I found some ads for PhD positions in his lab from the last two years, and the needed skill-set for those positions was pretty specific. I don't have all of the required skills (and I'd need new lab experience to gain them), although I know how these things work in theory and I do have solid ground to build these skills. I guess the pharma people didn't mind teaching me the skills I needed, so I wouldn't have been a burden for Prof's team.  \n\nAny thoughts are very welcome. Thanks to everyone who kept reading through my ramblings!!",

They kick it around like a mangy dog. My second paper was to be a small methods paper---nothing too ambitious---but last week I found a 20-year-old paper that seems to work better than my method, and is much simpler. All that work might have been for nought. So here I am. I have produced nothing of value. Fear in a handful of dust.\n\nMy advisor thinks I'm wonderful, and wrote me a beautiful letter. I’m afraid that he feels responsible for my failures, and wrote it out of guilt. My peers like me, and, I think, respect me. I did very well in my classes, and feel comfortable with my subject matter. I have been offered a good postdoc, and a couple of other promising interviews lined up, one in a very prestigious lab.  I’m a great presenter. Now, I know what some of you are thinking: \"This guy came in here to brag about how good he is!\" No. This is a pile of evidence that I’m nothing but surface and sheen, with nothing underneath it. I got a poster prize for the same research that keeps getting rejected. It made me furious and bitter. Of course I did. I’m a greasy car salesman. I can talk. But deep down, I’m just a common turd that’s cheated his way into it all. I know, I know, impostor's syndrome. I know it's a real thing, but it seems like false flattery, convincing myself that I have some kind of syndrome and that I’m not a real-deal faker. I know in my bones that I'm an impostor.\n\nIt’s getting worse. I lie awake recounting all the negative reviews and rejections, all the possible problems with my methods and results, all my personal flaws as a scientist. It seems too much. I want to give up. But how? Leaving academia isn't giving up, it's a whole 'nother set of problems. I resent this society where I have to decide---I don't want to decide! I'm a sweaty rat king of anxiety and self-loathing, and in no place to make a rational decision.\n\nWhy can't there be some divine judge who decides what to do with me? Or some super advanced A.I.? Some bureaucrat or some workers' council? Anything, anyone, no matter how stupid, arbitrary, or venal… Just decide for me where I’ll best serve society, and I’ll accept: Is it doing physics? Cleaning toilets? Would society be better off putting me down for good and letting me fertilize a field? Can I plead *nolo contendere*?",

        "text": "Hi all --\n\nI went to an R1 school for my undergrad / MS.  I started working with my advisor junior year of undergrad, was third author on one paper and worked uncredited on another (minor contributions).  I kept working with him through MS and got pushed into a collaboration that I did not enjoy.  Through this collaboration, we submitted 3 papers a total of 5 times with only 1 acceptance.  The projects were not something I believed in and my role was ill-suited to my strengths, so I was constantly put down by the collaborators (why isn't this done, this should be easy, etc.).  I spent most of my time under crunch deadlines trying to resubmit without fixing core issues with papers.  It's important to note that since I was funded as a TA for my entire MS, I was never actually hired as an RA.\n\nFrustratingly, I was always second author on these papers as they were slightly out of my concentration and so it was given to the other student who was a year older.  My advisor was kind throughout this process, but had high expectations and definitely pushed me more than reasonable for my mental and physical health (generic burn-out story).  Because I focused so much on research, I didn't make many connections to other professors and my only research-based recommendation letters were my advisor and collaborator.  \n\nI decided for a variety of reasons to switch schools for PhD.  I found a program that sounds amazing and it has rekindled my excitement for research.  I was ready to graduate last Fall (complete coursework, enough research to complete a thesis, etc.), but I ended up being pressured to write one last paper resulting in me not having time to finish my thesis.  Instead, I had to work on it remotely since I had already accepted a co-op for january-august.  I was irritated at having to pay an semester tuition (off-campus=no TA=no tuition waiver). My advisor said this arrangement was fine as I had enough research to finish my thesis.\n\nOver the months, I sent several updates and drafts of my thesis to my advisor, receiving no feedback.  Eventually, the paper from the Fall came back with comments and my advisor skyped me to tell me I had to do what amounted to roughly 20 hrs of work for a nearing resubmission.  When I asked about my thesis, he said that this is priority and the thesis needs to include this work.  I did it at night after my full-time job as I was desperate to graduate at this point. Eventually, I incorporated all this into my thesis, which achieved a \"looks good\" with 2 lines of feedback on the intro.  It was accepted, I graduated, life was good.\n\nThis happens again, during the summer.  They need another significant amount of work for the rebuttal.  I agree because I figure this is the last thing I'll do, I don't want to screw over the other student, etc.  Paper has good reviews, but someone on the PC tanked it. Rejected.  It happens.\n\nNow, I just got a passive-aggressive email that they want me to \"do my part\" for a resubmission to fix \"issues that have been apparent for months\".  To be fair, it is very, very likely to get accepted with additional effort because it so nearly got in before.  However, I'm starting a new PhD program in a month so I'm trying to ramp up on my new group's infrastructure, I am finishing my co-op and preparing to move across the country.  And most of all, I just don't want to do it.  It's not worth the effort for a second author paper that won't be at all related to my new research.  But I'm afraid that tanking the paper at this point (I'm the only one that could probably gather new results in time because I set up all of the experiments for our projects) would mean torching my only two real recommendation letters.  Is there a diplomatic way to refuse?\n\nTLDR; Since graduating, advisor has repeatedly pressured me into working on a second author paper that I have no interest, time, or motivation to resubmit.  Am I right in thinking this is unreasonable?  How to get out of it without burning bridges?\n\n(Field is Computer Architecture) ",

The quality of the work seems good, though, compared to many articles I've read.

And still, whenever I get free time, I look forward to learning new computer technologies. \nMy dilemma, as the title suggests, is whether I should follow Biological Sciences and go into research, which has a meagre pay in India, or follow my interest in Computer science and get into some IT jobs, which pay really well. \nI am really confused and cannot decide right now. \nMy current interest is in Biological Science, but I have to think about my future as well. \nAnd I like areas in Computer Science as well.\nAny help regarding this will be highly appreciated, I would be highly grateful if you provide your concern regarding my query.\n\ntl;dr - A lesser pay but more interesting career in biological science or good pay but maybe not so interesting career in computer programming.",

Successes after either all comes down to getting published. One is slightly better for research, however.\n\n\\--Not sure I want to be a professional academic. Getting the PhD is just a chance to get to do some cool research for 4 years and get a good income (from the schools). Afterwards, I'd be fine teaching community college.\n\n\\--The \"cool city\" is somewhere I've always wanted to live, but I've also always wanted to live with someone and have lived alone most of my life.\n\nI know some of these questions might be strange for this sub, I just have no idea what to do and feel so strongly pulled in two directions.

I am looking for some candid academic advice and feeling a little lost and desperate for direction.\n \n*Background info*:\nI am someone who is getting a bit of a late start in life, but needs some direction in my education and career.  I have an unrelated Bachelors in liberal arts, but was not the greatest student in undergrad. I have since matured significantly, gained some perspective on the world and made strides to take my education much more seriously, including earning an Associates in a foreign language and enrolling in IT certification courses, as well as adding military service to my repertoire.\n \nLanguages have always come easily to me. I studied Spanish, dabbled in French and Italian in college, and a few short periods of self-study in 3 other languages. That being said, I have always struggled with math. I understand and respect its necessity, but don’t enjoy it and it has never come easily to me, with the exception of a few specific areas of it, one of which being statistics and data patterns. I am fascinated by the reasoning behind *why* certain data trends exist. This is one of the few academic or professional areas that I truly feel passionate about, and could spend hours “going down the rabbit hole,” so to speak.\n \nThis, combined with my life-long hobby of tinkering with computers has led me to consider a potential Masters in Big Data, but before I fully commit, I am hoping for guidance. Is this an achievable goal, despite my lack of mathematical aptitude? And can I hope to be accepted to a reputable university despite my somewhat low undergrad GPA?\n \n*Other relevant factors*:\nAny further education is already completely paid for, so long as I keep my GPA up, and I am really only to pursuing a Masters at a European university (U.S. citizen/Irish dual citizenship, live in the U.S.).\n\nThank you for any advice. I am really hoping that this is an achievable goal for me, but if not, I would rather find this out now, so I can continue my search for some direction in my educational and professional life.",

My advisor decided that we need to pick a larger problem to work with, and was happy with the one I'd suggested. However, everything I throw at this problem yields absolutely nothing and hence I have nearly no progress to show for three weeks now. My advisor has been very supportive, even reassuring me that it's not supposed to be easy to solve. Despite his support, lately I find myself falling into the pattern of thinking of a new way to approach the problem, but dreading the thought of putting it on paper knowing I'll probably fail again, and hence not even trying or giving up at the first few steps. My self-esteem is lowering rapidly, to the point where I'm nearly convinced I won't be able to achieve my dream of working in this field. \n\nHow do researchers deal with such frustration on a problem and push on with it, instead of letting it affect their self-worth?\n\nTLDR: Multiple failures leading to lack of confidence to even attempt another way to solve the problem. \n\nEdit: It gives me some hope knowing that I'm not alone in this struggle and that three weeks is not usually enough to crack a problem. I'll try pushing on with it. Thanks a lot for helping me through the process and giving some words of wisdom :)",

Colleagues know my handle, so throwaway.\n\nI've been working with this particular student ever since she started at university, and within maybe 2 months of working on a particular project she already had publishable results, which we refined and published by the end of that year. That's rare by any standard, probably more-so in theory, and I don't think anyone who teaches her has seen anything like it for maybe 10+ years. She got her degree last year, with the straight-A's and our publications of course, and we're now midway through Honours. Chapter 3 of her thesis was submitted to me around week 3-4 of the first semester. Great work as usual. She contributes almost equally to our meetings and asks good questions during colloquia and the department journal club. She can even hold her own at conferences. \n\nBut she has no confidence. Absolutely 0. As an undergraduate, she did that stereotypical thing where a high achieving student laments over how terribly they must have done on the exam, only to get it back with 99% and annoy everyone. I figured she was just doing similar, but now I think she truly believes it. She even asked one of her professors last year to *lower* her grade in the class because she \"didn't deserve it\". \n\nOn a few occasions, I haven't been informed of interesting results because she didn't trust them, or at least didn't trust that her code was performing correctly. If I ask for something (a draft, an updated plot, etc), you can bet she'll leave it to the last minute and then rush, or submit it late. Even when things seem largely done, she'll continue to change it and then submit it late. I suggested she just send through whatever \"rough drafts\" she has anyway, which has helped things a tiny bit, but I can still tell that it's very stressful. It's been a struggle to get her to submit manuscripts sometimes. And she's still submitting late and making up excuses, which just isn't acceptable.\n\nThen there are her self-deprecating comments about how she's sure everything is wrong or just low-quality. When we have meetings to discuss a draft or recent presentation, she brings *her own notes* of everything she did \"wrong\"; they're excessive and mostly stuff I didn't even notice, or still can't see. Others in the department have nothing but praise as well, but I don't know if any of her cohort have been saying things to her. It certainly looks like they're all friends though. \n\nMost of my previous students were very confident, usually bordering on \"too confident\", and I had to rein them in. The couple who were less confident had poorer undergraduate results, so I could definitely understand Imposter Syndrome being there and they got better once they really got into their projects. \n\nI'm not sure how to constructively handle this level of insecurity. I find myself holding back with my feedback because any suggestions I make just seem to convince her that absolutely everything she does is awful. I'm concerned that this'll get worse towards the end of the year and really start hindering progress. And I don't know how she'll handle PhD programs if she can't take feedback. We're midway through the year and I don't think she's started any applications yet, or even looked at the scholarships/fellowships I sent her. I already suggested the on-campus counselling services for her stress, but I don't know if she ever followed through on that. I don't want to see a student like this burnout and drop out when there's so much potential there. ",

The reason why it's my 5th year is because i'm unable to take extra credits or summer/winter classes due to also having 3 part time jobs just to barely support myself. I'm an international student, and the minimum wage where I live/study is shit and i'm paying for everything on my own. No scholarships, no loans, no financial support from anyone else. So it's been really tough. \n\nAs a result my GPA is just average. Nothing extraordinary. Not to mention that half of my courses are taught in my 2nd language, so it's not even easy to get a good grade in the course if one just studied the material really well. If i could take the same courses in English, I'd have a better chance of getting A's. But my limitations in expressing myself in essays or catching terms and specific material during lectures due to the language barrier make it a double effort than the regular students just to pass the class because i essentially have to study everything twice over in both languages - which takes up a lot of time as well. \n\nSo as i'm looking at my CV/Resume, I'm feeling really depressed. All of my work experience is in retail, bartending, tutoring...all the part-time jobs I've ever been able to do since I turned 20. I can't get any related work-experience, no undergraduate research positions at my school (they don't pay and demand a ridiculous amount of time commitment, it's practically slavery) or internships. My field is linguistics and cognitive neuroscience - so not exactly popular either. \n\nI have no statistics skills, no computer language skills, and I have a lot of self-studying to do as it is during the summer just to prepare for graduation exams, language qualification exams,  and I need to use my free time to work my ass off to save as much money as possible because i don't have the time (or legal right, technically) to work as many hours during the semester. \n\nI'm stressing out because if i send my resume to an employer or for grad school applications - they are gonna take 2 seconds to look at it, and they will throw it away because it's beyond nothing special. My GPA isn't stellar and I have no applicable working experience. If i want to get into Grad school admissions committees aren't going to care about how many years I spent making sandwiches or shaking cocktails and dealing with children. They won't even give me the chance to explain my situation to them because my CV is so terrible. \n\nso now i'm panicking about what value my life has and what all this was worth when it feels like I've just dug myself into a huge pit by having to work so much and put aside focusing on my studies and building myself as a skilled and marketable person who could actually contribute to society...\n\nI'm going to be 30 when i finally graduate from undergrad. I am a woman who wants to date and someday have a family too so i have my damn biological clock playing against me as well. I have health problems so if i tried to have kids past age 35 there would be major complications.\n\nI feel like i have 2 choices: \n1) sacrifice my happiness and forget ever getting married and having my own kids so that i can focus on excelling academically and establish my career and for once make at least enough money that can support myself without living off scraps.\n\n2) sacrifice having a career and academic success so that i can have a social life and actually be able to build meaningful relationships with people and start my own family. \n\nI really wanted to go to grad school, but looking at my experience and grades nobody is going to want me, and even if by some miracle someone did, i wouldn't be qualified as any other student in the field because i am stupid and know nothing. No lab or real research experience, no statistics or computer skills, not even the right basal degree track...it seems so hopeless and I'm just so exhausted of living like this and i don't see the point.

However, she didn’t specify how many and what kinds of tasks will be there, either. \n\n***That would be arbitrary time and arbitrary amount of tasks, but a fixed amount of wage of 40 hours a week, and she is pushing me to agree with it. ***\n\nShe did say that I should trust that she treats students kindly, but she also threatened me and cursed me a lot, saying I have already caused too much management cost for asking such questions.\n\nI called our school and they said I can go to the police office to file a complain, but I have only been in the US for one year and I am not very sure whether it will cause trouble on me.",

        "text": "Hi AskAcademia, I have a challenging situation and could use advice.\n\nI am in an unfunded PhD that had begun funded with a contract for 4 years, but partway through the first year my PI/supervisor's funding fell through. I have a chronic, sometimes painful/sometimes disabling health condition. It is very common, but very unpredictable and affects women disproportionately more than men. The condition keeps me from doing certain activities that are very physical, and the department is unable to accommodate my physical needs with an office/workspace, so I set up one at home. I do a lot of unpaid RA work and I try and only do tasks that result in publications related to my thesis so that it feels like a worthy investment.\n\nI'm also older than my peers on average and one of the few women in the department. My husband and I had been trying three years to have a baby back prior to the PhD, and now in my second year of PhD it has finally happened; I am super excited! However, I'm mere weeks from giving birth and things have become very difficult with my supervisor. I haven't been paid since 2017; my supervisor has no project management skills and changes activities on the fly constantly; proposals for grants and papers are always done at the eleventh hour despite my pleading to get started earlier; the lab is too broke to get the needed equipment for running studies so we have to get 'creative' and build solutions that take up tons of (unpaid) time. There are more issues but those are the major ones. With the baby due in weeks, I haven't been feeling well at all and the heat wave doesn't help. Getting to campus has become very very difficult with all the appointments and commuting time. I want to just concentrate on getting through the major tasks that impact my studies for the next year (external student fellowship applications to aid my non-existent funding, journal paper revisions/submissions). The lab is trying to throw a bunch more tasks at me constantly, they expect me to do super physical tasks, they expect me to be present on campus 3+ days a week for hours a day when my work setup is at home, they expect me to be in-person at all meetings. The cherry on top is that I brought my own thesis topic to the lab, have published a ton in the past year, and yet my supervisor allowed/encouraged a peer to scoop my topic as their thesis. To be clear, this peer switched topics in their fifth year of PhD and did so because \"it was easier to get this topic funded\" than their previous one. This person is now receiving funding from a fellowship (even without their not having published on it), and I am not. There is no acknowledgement that this occurred, there appear to be no boundaries in the lab anymore about who works on what. We have four new students entering our lab this Fall, none are funded, and none of the existing students (except for my peer who scooped my work) are funded. \n\nMy supervisor told me today he is disappointed with my lack of engagement compared to before, and compared to other students in the lab (who are young, don't have family responsibilities, and who don't have a permanent health problem). I am worried my letters of reference from him for fellowships and opportunities for future paid work is going to suffer because of this. \n\nI understand academia can be hostile, but how can I make him understand that: 1) If I am not being paid, I cannot prioritize unpaid work? 2) If the department can't accommodate my physical needs (and I want to stress that they are simple requests) and I have to use my own cash/equipment to set up a home office, I cannot work at campus? 3) medical appointments are nearly always outside my control, and I can't always book around lab meetings/work sessions? 4) I am as committed to my work as ever, but as my funded PhD is now unfunded, I need to prioritize what I can to be able to survive the next two years and feed my family?\n\nI've told my supervisor all the above but the message isn't getting through, and our disability services are useless. I'm about to take a semester on leave (unpaid) and I am really afraid of the social/political ramifications when I return, and I have even more 'interesting' boundaries in place because I'll have a newborn. This has all really impacted how I feel about working in Academia post PhD. Any words of wisdom or advice is appreciated.",
