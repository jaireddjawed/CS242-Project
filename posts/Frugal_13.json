So I started asking people I know and so far nobody I've asked has heard of it. So i thought I'd drop the tip here. We've been saving animals fat for years (bacon fat is especially... special). So long as you render it fully and clean/strain it, it stores safely for 6+ months refrigerated. We just use it in place of cooking oils like vegetable/canola etc.",

        "text": "A few years ago, I decided to try the old fashioned shaving tool is called a safety razor.  I was surprised by how cheap the razor blades was.  I bought a pack of 100 blades for just $10 - a single blade cost only 10 cents.  They're so sharp.  Actually. a single blade can last up to five shavings.  Importantly, you need to do wet shaving with the safety razor.  I always keep my skin lubed with the cream when I shave.  I basically re-apply the cream after shaving when the skin gets so dry.  You don't need to lather the cream enough.  Another important part - you just need to do with right angle, even if you can't do the right angle, it won't definitely leave you bleed as long as it's still wet.  You probably need a aftershave lotion when you just finish shaving.\n\nThe safety razor can last your lifetime or even another generation when you want to pass to.  That's why I got my niece a gift on Christmas.  Women can do it with their legs or private parts.  Those people buy 100-year-old Gillette safety razors on eBay for over $100.\n\nWhat I bought:\n\nMerkur Long Handled Safety Razor 23C - $30 on eBay or $40 on Amazon\n\nCremo shaving cream - $7 at any store\n\nAstro Platinum 100 blades - $10 on Amazon\n\nNIVEA Men's Aftershave lotion -$7 at any store",

        "text": "Our washing machine finally bit the dust and I'm stuck on the fence if I should use some of my emergency fund to replace it. I had a technician come out to see about repairing it, and the total repair cost IF it's just the agitator would be around $450. If the motor is fried, the tech said to just buy a new one. He was unable to get the agitator off due to the bolt being seized or bent. Even an impact wrench couldn't get the bolt out and he tried for 5-10 minutes. The dryer works perfectly and has zero issues. It's a simple gas dryer that we keep as clean as we can and recently had our dryer ducts cleaned. \n\nI spoke with my \"in-laws\" who originally purchased the washing machine and dryer set about 7-8 years ago for my GF and said they didn't even pay near $400 for the washing machine, so they recommended we just replace it anyway since the repairs cost more than the unit itself. We can take our laundry to their house but that's cumbersome and a bit of a drive. We're doing it now since we need clean clothes while we're shopping for a new one. \n\nI have been looking and researching on what kind of washer to buy and Speed Queen keeps coming up everywhere. Reddit, YouTube and appliance review websites. Their TC5 seems to be the most recommended one due to it's simplicity and commercial build quality. The only issue is that it is $1,200, but if it's going to last for 10+ years I don't mind that kind of investment.\n\nI have a little under $4,000 saved in my emergency budget and just received a 28% pay raise/market adjustment. Go figure, here's a raise and a broken appliance! The GF and I both have substantial credit card debt, but I hope to have those paid off by the end of the year with my raise and spending habit changes we've implemented (rarely eating out or buying things frivolously). \n\nI'm worried that spending upwards of $1,500 (after taxes, installation and take away) for a washing machine out of our emergency budget isn't wise. I know with the upcoming holiday, there will be sales, but I haven't seen anything about Speed Queen sales. If not the TC5 Speed Queen, then I'd like to look into a LG front load washer that doesn't have a 2 hour long wash cycle. \n\nI feel stuck because this is the most I have ever saved and I'm scared of how long it will take to recoup the cost. A little under a year ago we had to replace our HVAC system and ended up financing it, which is my next debt to tackle once the high interest credit cards are payed off. The in-laws did offer to help us with the purchase of a new washer but I don't like owing people money and they already do so much for us in general it feels wrong asking them to help pay for something we can cover ourselves. Any advice is welcomed on this paralysis I'm dealing with.",

I never used the landline at my parents always just had a cell and VOIP if I needed it. Anyway my parents loved Youtube TV we had and the other apps, I told my parents our tv bill is 55.00 a month instead of 200 a month. Also we had access to many interesting shows etc.. and get live tv.  Well my Dad is stubborn and wanted the regular cable. Well after discussing it my parents GOT RID OF THEIR LANDLINE AND CABLE and just now use the internet and cell phones. I explained to them that my husband I have seen that we have an extra 300-500 end of the month because we cut the cord.   \n\nThe cord cutters in my family were me and husband, my cousin and his wife and my other cousin and her husband. As well as my uncle my Mom's brother. My Dad's sister was a hold out as well as my moms sister and my uncle and my parents.  Well my Mom was talking to her sister, my Dad was talking to his sister about separate thing. Well all the old fogies got onto zoom, they can at least use that and made a decision together to cut the cord! \n\nI was cracking up at how excited they were. I explained to them that this reddit forum made the final choice for me. \n\nSo I told them just do it for a month and see how you like it, My Mom does like having a phone handset like a landline so I ordered one of those that you can plug in.",
