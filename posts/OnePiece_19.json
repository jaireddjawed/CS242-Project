        "author": "TasumiThierl",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11n0sdh/10th_titanic_captain_bakkin_10th_redhair_officer/",
        "text": "The following is the script for my new [video](https://youtu.be/Y7AdwV1sJd4):\n\nBlackbeard's tenth Titanic Captain is one of the most debated One Piece mysteries. The last Strawhat is a little less often discussed. The 10th Redhair officer almost never. Blackbeard's Titanic captains will defeat the Redhair Officers and then get defeated by the Strawhats. Luffy and Shanks currently have only 9 people each, to confront the ten Titanic Captains. Hence, both Luffy and Shanks will get an additional crewmate before their fights against Teach take place. \n\nShanks has 10 named crewmates, but only 9 of them are officers. When Oda listed the Redhair Officers, Rockstar was not among them. He joined 2 years ago. That he wasn't promoted yet, indicates that he won't fight a Titanic Captain. In my video about Redhair Blackbeard match ups I discuss who he will fight.\n\nThe tenth members are Marco, Bakkin and Hancock. All three get way too much spotlight for their current roles. If Marco was retired for good, if Miss Bakkin was just delusional, if Hancock would at best amount to a grandfleet member then Oda wouldn't waste so many precious final saga panels on them. Instead he could have put them into coverstories, like he did with Grandfleet members or Bellamy, who truly retired.  He could have told us about Bakkin in the SBS. \n\nMarco defeated no one in Wano. He stalled some people. His presence wasn't neccessary. But because he went, he met the Redhair Pirates on his way back, and Shanks could again invite him.\nNo one expected Blackbeard to go after Hancock's Devilfruit. He failed, but he could come back and try again. So Hancock has to leave Amazon Lilly. She wants to go to Luffy.\n\nOda wants us to believe that Hancock's desire to meet up with Luffy is just a fantasy. That Marco, currently in his prime and still willing to fight in Wano, will not play any role in the Final Saga. That Bakkin, whose clone has proven to be very shrewd, just wanted Whitebeard's non existent treasure and is at her wits end now. Those who listened to this video till the end, won't be shocked when Oda subverts these expectations.\n\nHancock will set sail and find the Strawhats. She will join the crew. Marco will change his mind and accept the offer from Shanks. Bakkin once worked for Rocks. She could already be working for the one carrying his will. She had Weevil go after the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, who are Blackbeard's enemies.\n\nStussy has vampire teeth. Like Seki, King of Lulusia. The people of Lulusia might be of a vampire-like race. Miss Bakkin is likely from there, which is why Stussy, her clone, has the vampire features aswell. Lulusia was recently seemingly wiped off the map. I doubt that Oda had all those people killed. When CP0 was on their way to Egghead, Lucci suggested that Vegapunk's death sentence was connected to the Lulusia incident. Vegapunk probably somehow saved the island from annihilation. Thus the home's of Bakkin, Hancock and Marco were all unsuccessfully attacked by the World Government around the same time. As if Oda wants to link those three characters together.\n\nHancock and Marco are in opposite situations. Hancock wants to join Luffy, but she wasn't invited yet. Marco was invited by Shanks, but he doesn't want to join yet. Hancock has to leave her island, to keep it safe. Marco has to stay on his island, to keep it safe. Marco left for Wano and during his absence a corrupt navy officer tried to plunder it. Weevil had already arrived and saved the day. He was arrested by reinforcements, but his short tenure, as protector of Sphinx, demonstrates that Marco is replaceable. If he joins the Redhair Pirates, his new captain could declare Sphinx his territory.\n\nMarco would be Shanks'es Sanji. He refused Shanks two times already. If he joins, he would be the second Commander. No way he is stronger than Beckmann. Luffy's second strongest crewmate, Sanji also declined initially. He wanted to stay on the Baratie, because he felt he owed it to his adoptive father Zeff. Marco believes he has to stay on Sphinx because he owes it to his adoptive father Newgate. If Whitebeard was still alive, he would encourage Marco to become a Redhair Pirate, just like Zeff encouraged Sanji to become a Strawhat. Marco should know that. He didn't want to settle down at first, he took over the Whitebeard Pirates and lost to Blackbeard in the Paybackwar. As a Redhair Officer he could fight him again, under more favourable conditions.\n\nHancock would be Luffy's Oden, as absurd as that sounds. Hancock and Oden are two of the few people with Conqueror's Haki. Both arguably stronger than the official number three of the crew. Oden would probably have won against Scopper Gaban. Hancock would surely win against Sanji, perhaps even if she wasn't a woman.\nOden became a pirate because he wanted to escape his isolated home. Wano's borders are closed. Hancock's home is isolated via nature, by the calm belt. Hancock's tribe, the Kuja, are a female warrior tribe. Wano is renowned for its Samurai. Wano's capital is called the Flower Capital. Amazon Lilly itself is named after a flower. \n\nBoth trigger lust. Oden was a Gigachad, women were really into him. Many women and all men go crazy for Hancock. Because of his appeal, Oden was hated by the men of Wano at first. Hancock hates men. Both Hancock and Oden behave irresponsibly and yet are loved by their people. Hancock can kick kittens, and Oden can kidnap wifes, their citizens still adore them. Not long ago, It looked like Yamato would be Luffy's Oden. She even uses his name. Others called her the Oni Princess. Now we get the Snake Princess instead.\n\nRoger wanted Oden on his crew for his abilty to read Poneglyphs. Robin can already do that. Hancock could still fulfill a crucial role, as the animal tamer. The Kujas all have a snake weapon. Hancock's is called Salome, she could even bring with her some of those poisonous snakes, that repel Seakings. Then the Sunny could sail through the Calm Belt undisturbed, like the ship of the Kuja or those of the navy, coated in Seastone. That could come in handy in the Final Saga, where the Strawhats could be forced to go quickly from one point in the world to a distant next.  \n\nIn addition to a role, a Strawhat also needs a dream. Hancock started liking Luffy, when she learned that he had punched a Celestial Dragon. She had been their slave. Her dream therefore is to bring them down. Conveniantly, this works will with the dreams of the other Strawhats. Most of their dreams are interconnected. Robin wants to read the True History, written on the Rio Ponegylph, which is on Laughtale, where Luffy has to go to become Pirate King. The True History will include crimes the World Government comitted. This will motivate the Strawhats to depose the Celestial Dragons. \n\nLike the other Strawhats, she has a rolemodel connected to her sad backstory. Namely Fishertiger, who freed her from slavery. You might believe that he is already taken, by Jinbe. But the First Son of the Sea is not trying to emulate his old captain. Fishertiger, on his death bed, refused to take the blood of a human. Even though he felt guilty for his hatred of humans, he could never overcome it. Jinbe's dream is peaceful coexistence of humans and fishmen, his rolemodel is Otohime. She radically changed Saint Mjosgard and negoiated a spot on the Revery for Fishmen Island. \n\nI am convinced that I have identified the right characters, because Marco, Bakkin and Hancock already have tailor made opponents. Redhair Pirate Marco would take on Lafitte. So they are similar in fighting style and opposite in personality. Both have wings, and when they bring them out lose their arms. So they have to rely on kicks. Marco is compassionate, he protects the poor people of Sphinx. Lafitte was a sheriff, protecting the innocent was his job, but he mistreated them in cruel ways. \n\nMiss Bakkin, if she gets Weevil back somehow, would defeat Redhair officers Monster and Bonk Punch. When she faces the Strawhats, she would be defeated by Nami. \nBakkin, Bonk Punch and Nami all have living weapons. The malleable Weevil, the monkey Monster and the cloud Zeus. Bakkin is the smallest adult human we have seen so far. Monster is also small, perhaps of similar height. Bonk Punch is a big strong man like Weevil. Nami and Bakkin are both characterized by their greed. \n\nHancock would face Devon again. The Crescient Moon hunter collects heads of beautiful women. She hasn't given up on the one of the most beautiful. Devon won't fall for her and get petrified instantly again. Such a trick only works once. Hancock will have to beat her with her martial arts. Devon could turn herself into Luffy. That would put Hancock in a situation like that of Sanji against Bon Clay.  Kicking someone that looks like Luffy, will be as hard for her as it was for Sanji to kick someone disguised as Nami.\n\nBakkin and Marco are at the same place. Perhaps Oda plans to gather the tenth members on Sphinx, before the battles start. That would mean that Hancock would soon arrive there too. Sphinx is named after creatures of the same name, that also appear in mythology. A human lion hybrid. Our three pirates here are all linked to mythological creatures. Bakkin is only 2 feet tall and wears a green hat, she looks like an irish kobold. She likely also has vampire features. Dracula was created by an irish novelist, and likely based on Abhartach, an old irish legend. Hancock is based on the Medusa, who has snakes as hair and whose gaze turns people to stone. Marco ate a mythical Zoan that allows him to transform himself into a phoenix. A mythical meet up is about to happen on Sphinx.\n\nIf Bakkin is working for Blackbeard, she could try to capture both Marco and Hancock. Marco is an enemy of her captain and Hancock has a Devilfruit that he wants. She can't take them head on. But she could try to take them out just like her clone took care of Lucci and Kaku. Biting them when they are distracted. That wouldn't just be a parallel between Bakkin and Stussy, but even between their victims. Lucci ate the Leopardfruit, Kaku the Giraffe one. Leopeards prey on Giraffes. Birds prey on snakes and Hancock is linked to snakes, while Marco ate a Birdfruit.",

Also, luffy has become a yonko so it might also signify that shanks always knew what the fruit was and believes that as he has awakened his devil fruit, it might be time to greet him.\n\nWhat do you think will happen? Will he fight luffy, stand beside him or something else entirely. Because on one hand he has proclaimed that it's time to claim the one piece but on the other hand if you go to the very start of the story, shanks giving luffy Roger's strawhat could indicate that shanks acknowledges him as being the rightful successor to Roger.",

        "text": "Introducing two new theories for the 'D', based on what it looks like rather than what it stands for:\n\nFirst, it could depict a grin. Laughter and smiles are a common theme throughout One Piece, and the 'D' can be viewed as a grin (after all, it is often used as such in emojis). We also know that those with 'D' in their name tend to grin before death. See Luffy's wide, D-like grin before execution below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz21vdwr2rma1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b4375380d190249fd1992c64c7355ef184d3b8ea\n\nPotentially, this could also relate to the One Piece, because people laugh when they see it. And there are many more times laughter and smiles are relevant, e.g. SMILE fruit. Not to mention the final island is literally called LAUGH tale.\n\nTo take it further (and possibly too far), the period that follows could look like a single left eye. The left eye is also a theme of the show, with Luffy stabbing his left eye in Chapter 1, lots of people having scarred left eyes, and characters winking their left eye on cover spreads for important chapters. \n\nThe second theory is that it relates to the Red Line. That is, it is a split world. D shows half of the whole world, which would be O. The red line down the middle has split it. We are missing information to say more about this, but it is certainly a possibility.",

        "text": "Smoker has been one of the most disappointing characters in the series considering how he started. In Lougetown, Smoker beat Luffy hands down, absolutely one sided, no chance of winning if Dragon hadn't showed up. At Marineford, Smoker one shot Luffy for the second time. You could argue that it was because Luffy was injured, but considering that Smoker has a seastone weapon, and Luffy didn't have Haki, this was another one sided victory. Sadly, in Punk Hazard, even buffed up with Haki, Smoker went on a loss streak. Yes, it was true that there was an outside reason for each loss, but the fact that he vanished after this and hasn't made so much as a peep in anything other than the non-canon movies is really sad.\n\nSo, the biggest way that Smoker can be redeemed as a character in terms of story significance at this point is with an extremely rapid power boost. &gt;!The fact that he's at the base next to Egghead!&lt; lets us make 3 probable guesses.\n\nFirst, he will become the series' first confirmed awakened logia, which would be the power he needed, along with it being a little poetic, considering he was the first logia user introduced in the series. It would also illustrate a few major things that come with logia awakenings that would actually excuse being overly weak at Punk Hazard. If he is able to fight Luffy, it would tell us that an awakened logia, even without offensive powers in its own right, is emperor level strength, and would serve as a narrative device to reintroduce Smoker as a foil for Luffy, and sharply change the power balance of the world in favor of the Marines. Obviously, I would love and expect to see, at least in part, this option.\n\nThe second option, however, would be far more lackluster. He could get cybernetic upgrades. We see it with Queen and Franky, &gt;!plus with Vegapunk, it'd be some of the most advanced and powerful augmentations in the series.!&lt; Sadly, this is probably the worst of the three possibilities in terms of a narrative point. It would undermine the idea that hard work matters by implying that if you want to be emperor level strong, just become a cyborg. On top of that, while Smoker probably wouldn't hate the idea on principle like Tashigi would, it wouldn't play to his established strengths, and he would be relying on them to fight, which would be like a sadder version of Queen. Worst choice that could be made in my opinion.\n\nThird option, he didn't get any better. Now, this may seem stupid, and even worse than the upgrades, because with those he'd at least be stronger. But I argue against that line of thinking. Even without a power boost, his personality wouldn't change, making him a more endearing character that doesn't break his principles even in the face of overwhelmingly low odds, which is already established as one of, if not his strongest, trait. Sadly, he would be taking a backseat in terms of relevance within the story, because even in one piece, people without power aren't going to make many waves. He would probably still be important, probably a key piece of a puzzle when it comes to dealing with the Marines, but he would lose a lot of his significance.\n\nAll in all, I hope and pray that it's the first option, I would be disappointed with the third option, and would be outraged with the second option.",

        "text": "- The flora and fauna used to be pretty giant, but back then the world wasn't divided on small islands. Today, because of a phenomenon that we also have in the real world called \"island dwarfism\", the flora and fauna shrunk to fit the dimensions of the islands it's stuck on.\n\n- The Onigashima skull is joyboy's skull, he was Oars I, the first pirate ever, captain of the Dawn pirates, who after disbandment decided to carry on the will of their captain by adopting the middle name \"D\". Oars II, his son (the zombie from thriller bark) is known as \"the continent puller\", because he pulled together some islands (maybe with bare strength, maybe with the help of technology), creating the land of Wano  (which has various districts with totally different bioms). The land of \"Wano\" is the land of \"One\". A sort of \"promised land\" that joyboy set out to create. It's right ontop of the submerged under rainwater Old Wano, which is the original project started by Oars I.\n\n- Blackbeard has the cerberus mythical zoan fruit or some other mythical zoan of a japanese mythology creature with three heads/faces. This is why he has no need to sleep, because he has three brains, and this is why he has two addictional devil fruit \"slots\" - because he has three hearts.\n\n- Monkey D. Dragon used to be a navy admiral, so he has first hand knowledge of the inner workings of the world government. All admirals have nicknames that translate to color + animal: Akainu = red dog, Kizaru = yellow monkey, Aokiji = blue phasant, Fujitora = wisteria tiger, Ryokugyu = green bull. They're all zodiacal signs from the Chinese calendar. Hence the name Dragon.",

        "text": "With the reveal in the latest chapter, now seemed like a good time to post about the ongoing whodunnit mystery of the Egghead Island Arc and what the possible outcomes could be. So I’ve compiled a list of what we know and breakdown of possible suspects! Let me know if I missed anything or got any of it wrong.\n\n**What We Know**\n\n* Some time ago Vegapunk began research on Poneglyphs/the Void Century\n* Some time ago Vegapunk split his mind/knowledge up among himself, six clones, and Punk Records\n   * All seven satellites regularly synchronize with Punk Records\n* Seraphim only obey direct orders from the Five Elders, the Vegapunks, Sentomaru, or someone with an “authority chip”\n   * Five Elders have highest authority level, followed by VP, Sentomaru, then chips\n   * Commands can’t be issued over Transponder Snail, they must be in person\n   * Commands can be overridden by someone with a higher authority than the one who gave the command\n      * A higher authority command *can* be overridden by a lower authority command if the original commander is unconscious/dead (like when Lucci gave the Seraphim orders that contradicted Sentomaru’s orders after Sentomaru was knocked out)\n      * The same authority level command *cannot* be overridden by the same level command, even if the original commander is unconscious/dead (like when Stussy couldn’t give orders that contradicted Lucci’s even after knocking him out)\n   * Seraphim are capable of limited decision making on their own\n* The World Government learned about Vegapunk’s Poneglyph research\n   * The Stella believes that someone leaked the information\n* Recently someone on Egghead began capturing Cipher Pol agents as they left the island and locking them away in the “Old Devil Fruit Research Lab”\n* Currently St. JayGarcia Saturn, Kizaru, and 100 WG ships are en route to Egghead\n   * Kizaru requested “as many warships as possible.” For reference, there were 50 marine ships at the Summit War and a Buster Call typically includes 10 warships\n   * Sentomraru and Morgans have both predicted that this will be “another Ohara”\n* Shaka contacted Dragon and told him that he suspected to die soon\n* Lucci attacked and knocked out Atlas\n* Frontier Dome defenses went down, allowing CP0 to get to the Labophase\n* Stella requested that Stussy help\n* Bonney turned Stella into a child\n* CP0 ordered the Seraphim to attack Egghead\n* Stussy betrayed Lucci, Kaku, and CP0 and sided with Vegapunk\n* Edison ordered S-Snake, S-Shark, S-Hawk, and S-Bear to stop fighting\n* Atlas was repaired\n* Egghead’s defenses went down, forcing the Vegapunks, Straw Hats, and Stussy to stay\n* An unseen figure attacked Pythagoras\n* An unknown figure began taking out security cameras on Egghead\n* Usopp, Franky, Lilith, and York found out that Pythagoras survived\n* Pythagoras knows something that he thinks they all should have realized already\n* York saw S-Snake moving and said that that contradicts the order that Edison gave\n* S-Snake turns York to stone\n* S-Bear and S-Snake attack not only Luffy, Zoro, and Shaka, but also Lucci and Kaku\n* Stella turned back into an old man\n* Someone captured Stella and put him with the Cipher Pol agents in the Devil Fruit room\n* S-Shark attacked Nami, Brook, and Edison\n* Someone shot Shaka in the head\n\n**The Suspects**\n\n* **Atlas -** She seems like the primary suspect, mostly by means of elimination. She would have been the only known Vegapunk available to shoot Shaka (Edison, Pythagoras, and Lillith were all visibly occupied at York had last been seen as a statue with S-Snake having no opportunity to change her back). The fact that she mentions using face-altering tech also makes her suspect imo.\n* **Edison -** Edison was the last Vegapunk to give the Seraphim an order before they turned on the heroes. Based on Stussy’s explanation of her inability to contradict Lucci’s orders, another Vegapunk *should not* have been able to contradict Edison’s order of “stop fighting.” (York even specifically notes this). So if Edison didn’t give the order to attack, the order would have had to come from either the Elder Stars or a yet-unidentified way of taking control of the Seraphim. S-Shark did just beat the crap out of Edison, but notably left him alive so it could have been a fake out to throw the others off his trail. In fact, everyone has been comparing this sublot to And Then There Were None, in which (spoiler) the culprit fakes his own murder to fool the others.\n* **Punk Records -** I have to admit, I probably wouldn’t have thought of this one if it wasn’t a popular fan theory. The Stella’s head shrunk after the application of Punk Records and his clones, indicating to me that he literally “deposited” (and therefore forgot) his memories and knowledge into Punk Records. This would mean Punk Records was holding an insurmountable amount of information (possibly too much for even seven geniuses), so I could absolutely see the thing going full Skynet and taking control of SSG. If Punk Records is directly accessible by the World Government, this makes it even more likely.\n* **The Seraphim -** Given the clear sentience the Seraphim have displayed, they could definitely have their own motivation. The fact that their “limited decision making capability” is pointed out also raises suspicion, since that is always an excellent foreshadowing to an invention becoming self-aware. S-Bat, S-Flamingo, S-Crocodile, or the like could be manipulating things behind the scenes. \n* **Another Vegapunk -** Mostly throwing this one on here because I keep seeing folks suggest it. A “rejected” Vegapunk clone would certainly have the motivation to betray Stella, but to me it seems like a much less interesting twist than the other possibilities. It would line up with some of Pythagoras’s lines though. It would also mean a chance to design a “failed clone” character, which seems like something Oda would like doing.\n* **York -** York might be the least ambitious Stella, but we know little enough about her that she could definitely be harboring a secret agenda. She was one of the first Stellas to get defeated, but the circumstances were a tad suspect: S-Snake just turned her to stone, which could easily be reversed. Also Pythagoras, who had just learned something important about the traitor, specifically asked where York had gone just before this.\n* **The Stella -** It’s hypothetically possible that the Stella is playing a wild mind game to fool everyone, pretending to be targeted as a means of distraction. He was the only satellite to be explicitly spared after being attacked, so if the traitor really wanted Vegapunk dead they clearly missed an opportunity. The Stella is also the original Vegapunk, so it wouldn’t be shocking to learn he “technically” has authority over the other satellites. The fact that he aged back up without explanation is also odd, but could just be Bonney’s powers wearing off for an unrelated reason. \n* **Shaka -** Shaka was a pretty popular suspect early on, mostly because he was the one dispensing most of the information about the traitor and could therefore easily lie about things such as not being able to find the Stella. Getting shot in the head seems to make this less likely, but like I said with Edison that *would be* a classic whodunnit fakeout. I imagine that particular death would be hard to fake, but hologram technology and face swapping devices are definitely both on this island so you never know.\n* **Pythagoras -** Pythagoras’s survival of the assassination attempt is a tad suspect, but given that no one was around to see it I find it very unlikely it was faked. It is worth noting though that Pythagoras clearly knows *something* that he hasn’t gotten a chance to tell the others yet.\n* **Lilith -** As the personification of Evil, Lillith seems like a decent candidate. She also was in charge of the sea beasts, which were also responsible for capturing the Cipher Pol agents. She was recently turned to stone after being attacked by S-Snake, but since S-Snake’s powers are extremely reversible this could just be a play to make her seem innocent to the others.\n* **Stussy -** Stussy has betrayed two different organizations since we’ve met her, so I think folks are naturally suspicious she’s gonna pull another fast one. I’d personally find it tiring for her to switch sides again, but that doesn’t mean she can’t. Her inability to stop Lucci’s orders was also a bit suspect imo so there’s that to consider.\n* **Catarina Devon  -** I honestly think folks just suspect her because of her powers. It would allow her to get away with all of this, but it would be a pretty odd choice since she has no relationship to anybody in this arc. Unless we learn something about her relationship to Buckingham Stussy, which could be interesting. Devon is also unaccounted for in both the Whole Cake Island invasion and Winner Island battle. Blackbeard has clearly been spreading his fleet out to accomplish goals that cover his bases. Kidnapping Vegapunk for his poneglyph knowledge while playing the WG and Straw Hats against each other also falls well within Teach’s usual tactics.\n* **There is no traitor -** This would by far be the lamest outcome imo, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t throw it out there. Kizaru’s speed, JayGarcia’s unknown powers, and Caribou’s mischievousness all mean they could hypothetically be involved here. Judge/Caesar have also recently decided to turn on Vegapunk in the latest cover art and messing with Vegapunk’s tech would be possible for both of them.",

        "text": "So a lot of people hate the thought of 'Fate' in any story.\n\n\"Fated to save the world\"\n\n\"Fated to destroy everything\"\n\n\"Fated.... whatever\"\n\nI believe that One Piece has handled this very touchy subject incredibly well thanks to Observation Haki, with Madam Sharley being a prime example. She can \"see the future\" with 100% certainty, and so has opted to NOT look into the future any further as Her 'gift' is a burden to her, and believes that the future is best left unknown. She only did so when the Straw Hats came to Fishman Island because she felt compelled to look into what the future held for Luffy.\n\nWith Sharley's future \"sight\" or \"readings\", whichever they may be, I think is a good example of what happened during the Void Century as what happened was coming to an end.\n\nBut the information was left on Laugh Tale solely.\n\nThe Roger Pirates being \"too soon\" read the story, and realized they weren't the ones who were \"Foreseen\" to change the world.\n\nThe Story they read was probably somebody's reading of the future, and with no name given, its \"Someone will arrive in the future who unlocks the Gomu-Gomu's true potential\" and that isn't fate any longer, it's just insane Observation Haki. It's not fun, interesting, or rewarding to know the future that cannot be broken. Not because of \"Fate\" but because its just what happens because it happens. If the future cannot be changed even with the Time-Time Fruit, then Toki could've jumped to when Luffy and others had already succeeded if she wanted to.\n\nBut Love, Happiness, and the feeling over building something of your own is more than rewarding enough than taking the easy way out. Whether that's giving up on life, or with Toki's case, jumping to where the problems are already handled. She loved Oden, and thus wanted to die in Oden's time.\n\n'Fate' isn't as prevalent at least in One Piece, but I think Haki has rendered it muted a bit which I think is a positive. Madam Sharley was the beginning of trying to dissipate and prepare us for what is to come, Katakuri was a further proof that anyone dedicated enough could accomplish it, even if only a few seconds, and then the Ponegliphs will be the tale of the past and future that will collide and bring about a New Era.\n\nDo poke holes in my train of thought though, can't come up with better theories or discussions if one doesn't get feedback.",

So i try to see other sailing ships from One Piece and found all of them are also really unlogical. \n\nI mean Unlogical, it's not like normal sailing ship from real life. They are huge (really huge than normal man-of-war class), have house-like in the center of the ship that also works as \"normal house\", weird gun placement, and trees? also there is giant Raft? Wow that's weird. \n\nSo i try to join the franchise and begin reading the manga. Tbh, i love the story, but their ships is still make me weird. I know this story is not about epic ship battle and something like that. But the ships still also the main part of the story because how huge the ocean in One Piece. \n\nSo why ships in One Piece is feels unlogical?",

        "text": "Yes, worse than Dressrosa.\n\nThe story from the beginning of the raid until the gear 5 reveal feels like a massive fever dream. So much bizarre pointless shit occurred and it all runs together.\n\nThe pacing. The numbers. The ice oni. The tobiroppo fights. Stair piece. Roof piece. The bizzare deaths. Can anyone even remember what happened to Apoo and what he did in the arc? When do the Queen and King fights even start? They were hardly even memorable fights anyway. Where did Jack go? How many times did Luffy even fight Kaido? My brain still struggles to even accept that Big Mom vs Kidd and Law was a thing that happened. \n\nThen there's Yamato and the chaos she threw the fan base into for 2 years. I don't think we will ever go through anything as bad as that again.\n\nIt probably doesn't help the entirety of this part of the arc happened during COVID too. How many people just stopped reading the actual chapters at some point?\n\nThe start of final saga has been such a relief so far and pacing has been mostly better. I just hope we don't have to through something as arduous as onigashima ever again.",
