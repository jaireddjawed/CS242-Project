Not full blown NPD, but I started noticing the 3-4 stage/pattern of idealization, devaluation, discard, and hoover. \nThe idealization part was the most obvious at the beginning (saying i love you easily, that was cute though) and when she just received gifts from me. \nThe devaluation part was noticed after some time passed after receiving the gift, by making comments about the color of my skin, the way I dress and the size of some body part (small ears, big nose, pink skin, yellow teeth, should wear less formal clothes and be more into sportswear/underdressing)\nThe discard part was noticed when I go to the gym or spend an extended time with some friends (just male, not even female)\nI had a bad experience with an ex-gf who was a covert narcissist and i ended up doing some damage control. No big deal since we weren‚Äôt engaged. But now family is involved and I already purchased a rather expensive diamond ring üòÖ (silly me)\nI don‚Äôt want to go through the advanced discard phase and hoovering as it would be too damaging emotionally. \nWhat are your advices ? I want to have kid and I heard narcissists can turn your kids against you.",

She is a year younger than me so she will not be going to college with me till next year. I feel like I've started to lose feelings more and more the closer I get to college and I think it has to do with the fact that ever since I was young and seeing my big brothers live the college life i've always wanted to get the FULL college, which is obviously near impossible with a girlfriend. My problem is I feel like if I break up with her I'll regret letting her go because I do genuinely see myself marrying her but I also feel if I stay with her and heavily restrict my college life I 1. won't enjoy college as much as I was hoping too and 2. will regret not going crazy in college when i'm older.

        "text": "\nHello,\n\nSo I will try to keep this short. We have been in a relationship for 10 years. I do love this person very much and I feel like I make her part of my priority in my life. \n\nSome context. I don‚Äôt really have a big family. It‚Äôs just my mom and I and hold lots of responsibility in the house since I was 18. My gf has both parents and a sister who‚Äôs older and they live with their bf. We both live with our parents and we live relatively close.\n\nAnyways. I have a normal 9-5 job and she works around 11-7 job and doesn‚Äôt usually have weekends off while I do. I never really ask her to hang out after she gets off work because I want her to relax or have time for herself which she has expressed before so I respect that. Though last week she went out with her girl-friends out dancing and drinking on a Monday night after work till 1am while she had to go work the next day at 10am. I only get bothered about that because I‚Äôm the past when I asked to hang out after work she would say she‚Äôs tired and wants to sleep and feel rested for the next workday.\n\nRecently, we planned to do something in the afternoon and I asked if we could have dinner after and she just said ‚Äúyeah, but my sister asked to do something so I‚Äôll have to double check with her‚Äù. Which makes me feel like not a priority in her by not considering how I feel given that we don‚Äôt get to always spend time together. Also, it‚Äôs worth mentioning her sister has no problem saying she cannot hangout because she has plans with her own boyfriend. \n\nSo overall it just makes me feel crappy. Am I doing something wrong here? Is it valid to feel like this?\n\n\ntl;dr My (26F) GF chooses her Friends and Family over me (28M). In a 10 year relationship. Don‚Äôt feel like a priority. Is it valid to feel like this?",

I have never asked to see it until last year: he invested in stocks and lost a lot of money, so I started to feel unsafe and asked to participate in our financial decisions. He said is non of my business and he will never tell me how much he lost. CONTEXT: Married for 7 years. I gave up my life back in my home country and moved in with him. He wants to have a baby next year but that is risky for me, because by law, IF we ever divorce I would not be able to move back to my country with the kid without his permission. I have no real support system here in this country. He makes more money than me and pays a bigger share of the bills, pays vacation, dinners, and give me ocasional gifts. Still, i hear that married couples to their financial decisions together, but he is letting me out of it. I am not a gold digger, i have my savings and contribute proportionately to bills. He says he does not want to see my bank account and he will not show me his, and we should just trust each other, but if feels he does not trust me with his finances. What if we have a child and something happens to him, how will we get access to the family finances for safety‚Ä¶  I also wonder if Is there any transactions he is perhaps hiding.\n\ntldr: husband does not want me to see his bank account, ever, and is pressuring for a baby.",

        "text": "TLdR: I stayed with my boyfriend with slept with his friend and he did not tell me and got back together. I am still his friend. I apologized to him. And everything is just so toxic rn. I need a way out. \nTo cut it short,. I will be objective and mention what happened:\n1. After 6 months of casually seeing each other we became serious. That too, he did not overtly said or accepted that I am his gf. He believes in \"No tags\" etc. And this is during lockdown.\n\n2. We had lots of fights. He did not like my friend, who did not like him. At around the same time, he wanted to venture into music and be a producer. I was like fine and he asked me to make videos for the music he creates. Mind you, this is at the age 20. I said okay i will try my best and help you as much as i can.\n\n3. I know, i said that. He got very serious very soon. I was very happy for him. But i was still discovering myself. He made it \"our\" dream. Sure, i mean it was good to talk about it. But that did not mean i was not allowed to do anything else right? He kept telling me college is useless. Do not indulge in it. I am a law student, btw. I cannot tell you how many things i have let go because of me\n\n4. And i did help him. I bought him his first set of professional headphones which costed with 180 dollars. I got him his midi which costed me around 250dollars. And i did it happily. Nothing to brag here honestly.\n\n5. He wanted me to wake up at 6 in the morn. Sit with him on a video call and work fo 6 7 hours on something that i was not sure i wanted. And yes, i know what you are thinking - I DID TELL HIM. Not once but four time. Every time i told him i don't want to do this. He would call me lazy and what not and cry. Cry a lot. So just to pacify him. i would say okay I'll do it .. he came aggressive about it. He would get angry abuse me. And I, like a fool only tried to pacify him. \nSo much so that i convinced my self in my head that why the fuck am i not doing this.\n\n\n6. In between the legal projects i was doing of my college. I did not tell him . He would find out.i tried telling him that i am managing both. But acc to him this was me just being **** and betraying him.\n\n7. Now, coming to friends. He himself was a charming boy in the first year of our college.  He had casual relationships. He was everyone s favourite. And then he just one day told me that everyone is trash and that they hate him and that I should also stop talking to them. I left out my friends. \n\n8. In all this, i was just losing myself one bit at a time. With every fight. Every outburts, i was told how all of it is my fault. How i pushed his career back.\n\n9. When we finally met, i thought it will be different. Even while writting this, i feel like i am being the victim or trying to gain sympathy. Atleast this is what he would say. \n\n10. So, in short. I stopped seeing my friends. I just stopped. I tried to make him comfortable.  \n\n11. We had decided that we will do a legal internship together. But i had a buffer month. So i thought ill do an extra internship and we comes i can do one with him. He came before. \nSo what did he do? He made it about himself. He made it about loyalty. That i chose an internship over him.\n\n12. So much so that i said you know fine. You do not want to stay me and stay committed, we can be casual. I honestly, did not think about it. Feburary i interned and March he interned with me in the same office\n\n  We are practically togther all the time. What i did not know and got to know after months that he had already started sleeping with his friend. A friend that he has been talking for sometime, now. When i asked him that why did you not tell me he said and i quote \" YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO KNOW\".  Because i was interning and wanted to focus on my career. He did not offer support. No. Not once did he say that you go and kill it. No. \nAnd when i became mad he was like you have no right to do so because \"YOU LEFT ME\" . \n\n13.  I am so stupid. I should have left him. But i couldn't. He also went to her house (his friends house. Whom he was sleeping with) for a week. And i was crying and howling over the phone and he kept shouting at me and scolding me\n\n14. Cut to now, i ty and be his friend. He wants me to love him like a girlfriend i guess. But he wants to stay as a friend. It's been an year. And now i have got to a point where i am angry at him and it comes out in really ugly ways. He says he has no regrets. \n\n15. Also, he started using his hands on me when i asked him too much about that. He still talks to that girl..\nAnd i feel so stupid. Like how do I even get back to.life.  I do not know who to talk to. People judge me. And in my head i just blame myself\n\n  I keep thinking did i make him like this.\nThe entire last year is so blurry.\n\n16. I have lost everything. My drive,y ambition .\n\n17. Whenever i fight again with him, and tell him that you did not give me any closure . You could have told.me. he just keeps saying how i abuse him, use him and just scar him.",

We hit it off at the party and we have been talking for a few weeks now. She is very mature for her age and even looks older than I do. Everything has been going so well and I really like this girl. We have even talked about being exclusive. Her personality is a 10/10 and she is extremely attractive 10/10 (she‚Äôs a model). The kicker is she just told me today that she is also still in high school. She initially told me she was in college (which she is) but didn‚Äôt tell me she was also in high-school (dual enrolled). She also works while in school. I myself am a senior in business school, I would also like to add I recently turned 24 (last month) and she will be 19 in 6 months, if that makes a difference lol. I have no problem getting women my age or anything like that and I would say I‚Äôm above average/handsome. Her parents have even advised that she dates older men. She also told me she had talked to men older than myself. In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt seem weird to me of our age difference. We share a lot in common and there are no signs of a maturity imbalance. I have dated women 5+ years older than me in the past whom were less mature than this girl. My intentions are good and so are hers, we have been taking things slow. But I‚Äôm scared of what my family and friends would think, is this weird? Any help or advice? Thank you.\n\ntl;dr I‚Äôm 24 and she‚Äôs 18.",

She said we should stop talking but I dont get how this happened.\n\nSo I (m22) have been friends with a girl (f21) for a little over a year now. I was initially honest friends with her, i didnt really feel interested in her and she honestly wasnt my ‚Äútype‚Äù i guess. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but i didnt want a relationship with her for sure lol. Regardless, when I realized I had feelings for her around four months ago. I told her right away, as I felt it would have been disingenuous to be a friend through that but it felt like we had actually gotten closer after that. We started texting everyday and hanging out every now and then until recently.\n\n\nShe‚Äôs been getting angry at me and its confused me a lot. I haven‚Äôt changed how I‚Äôve acted in the time before and after we became friends, but everytime she did get angry with me I felt like I had to be less like myself.\n\n\nLast week she told me we should stop talking because she finds herself getting angry with me for things she believe she shouldnt have. Continuously reassuring me that it wasnt something that was my fault. I went into a panic mode and tried to text her and talk to her like usual for the next couple of days but talks to me differently. So i realized that I was being selfish and bothersome and apologized for not respecting her wishes and stopped. She said it was okay and she understands since we‚Äôve been talking for a while and again reassured me that it wasnt anything that I did.\n\n\nBut I dont get it? If thats the case why does it feel like im getting punished for it.\nAnd when I look back, ive seen other people say the same things ive said to her that she gets mad about, but she would react differently. Im starting to think its only because its me that she got angry.\n\n\nI guess im asking for advice on what to do now? We have a lot of mutual friends so sometimes I feel like I need to talk to her for closure later down the line. But I also want to get rid of the shitty feeling i get whenever I think about her.",

Before I had a hard time understanding it was a joke, but now after years I have changed ‚Äúso I can take a joke‚Äù.  But in social situationens there are often a lot of people making jokes about me, and laughing at me. They think it is funny because they like my reaction and how defensive I get. When it usually happens, my head gets stressed. Everywhere I look is it as people are laughing at me and making fun of me. In these situations I get so stressed I don‚Äôt even know what I am saying anymore and everything gets foggy. My friends know I have issues about this, but they keep on doing it. Days, and sometimes weeks after, I can feel my mental health and self confidence is struggling. \n\nI have put a lot of boundaries up to people when this happens, but they keep on not respecting it. So therefore I feel as though I have put up an unreasonable boundary. People tell me, when I seek for advice, that I should change the way I respond, I am overreacting, or I am too sensitive. But everytkme it happens, I feel so drained, sad and disappointed afterwards.\n\nTherefore I seek some outside advice, because I dont know what I should do anymore. Is my boundary too unreasonable? Do I try and take a deep dive in my issues, and change the way I respond when these situations happens? Am I too sensitive? \n\ntl:dr ; My friends keep making fun of me and often takes it too far. Is a for this boundary socially acceptable, or am I just too sensitive?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11lq88k/i_confessed_to_my_best_friend_of_6_years_and_now/",
        "text": "I was very reluctant to post this as I've never been one to really reach out to strangers on the internet for real life problems but what the hell I guess. This is also my first time ever posting to this subreddit and sorry if its really long.\n\nSo I am 20 almost 21 years old and have never had a girlfriend. I have had a crush on my best friend for almost 6 years and it absolutely wrecked me for so long. I asked her out over text in highschool to which she replied with something along the lines of \"I value our friendship too much.\" Eventually she got a boyfriend in 2021 and I used that to help myself not feel too strongly about her for a while. In October she broke up with her boyfriend, now ex, who she had been dating for a little over a year because he stopped showing her trust and respect and it was her first long lasting relationship. In November she and I reconnected and started talking again (for 6 months we didn't talk for a different reason but during that time I was scared that I had lost one of my best and closest friends) and in January I was hanging out with her at her house one night and everything felt so great, we were talking and laughing and some flirting was going on and we planned to hangout the next day as well. Plus the entire week leading up to that weekend felt amazing, the communication was great, texting was fast and frequent and consistent, we facetimed twice that week (something we had never actually done before) and one of those calls lasted for almost 6 hours. I decided that the following day was the day that I would finally tell her. \n\nThe entire day we were hanging out I felt overwhelmingly anxious and awkward and scared. But eventually I reached a point in that day where I made it my \"do or die\" moment. Right before I even began that conversation I could feel my voice start to shake and begin to break and choke up and I could feel that tears were about to form in my eyes. And with a broken and choked up voice I mustered the words \"I really like you. And the crush I had on you in high school never really went away.\" And I started to spiral, I let some tears loose, I didn't sob or anything but the fear of losing one of my best and closest friends was overtaking my mind but I knew that if I continued to hold back on this I would be destroying myself. Two pivotal points that followed: 1) She asked me a question along the lines \"What do you want to do?\" and I froze, I'd never been asked a question like that before and honestly just hadn't prepared for it. I had one thing going through my mind that day which was I need to tell her, I wasn't thinking about what came after or what was going to happen. 2) She eventually said \"Do you want me to be honest? I have a crush on you too but I don't feel ready to be in a relationship.\" She brought up how she felt like she felt emotionally unavailable, that she had some healing and growing to do, and that she wouldn't be able to give enough of herself in a relationship at this current moment in time and that if she were to be in a relationship right now it would not reflect well on who she actually is in a relationship. \n\nPeople have told me that I shouldn't feel dumb for it, but I can't help but feel stupid for crying that day especially in front of her. The day prior had been so energetic and fun and that day was awkward and anxiety ridden. But we ended the discussion on the note that neither of us wanted things to change. Later that night I texted her to reassure myself that I wasn't misreading anything from her end and asked something along the lines of \"It's not that you don't feel similar for me, but you just don't feel ready right now.\" To which she responded with \"Yeah we're on the same page.\" To which I said \"Ok perfect and as much as I like you and wanna date you I understand and wanna give you that time to figure things out.\" \n\nThe following weeks I tried my best to act normal and act like nothing had changed like trying to start conversations and maintain them and flirt and give cheesy compliments but tbh it felt like those weren't well received and I couldn't help but feel like things were just off, like the conversations and replies were more spaced out and less energetic. Which looking back on it I should have just said nothing after that conversation and just given it more time and space. \n\nIt felt as if my mentality involuntarily shifted and without even realizing or trying or wanting to I got all serious and heavy. It was as if this new area that I had never been in before presented me with all these new questions and things that I wanted to talk about. In my mind I was scared that our friendship was just sitting in limbo and I wanted to talk about boundaries and where things were at and where things were going because we both acknowledged that things felt kind of different in our relationship. But when I texted her to see if she wanted to talk about that stuff she replied with, \"everything I said the last time we talked was true and still is true. But when I said I didn't want a relationship I meant it and honestly I wish we hadn't had that conversation if it was going to setup some kind of unintentional obligations because I'm not looking for anything like that.\" And I tried to clarify that I was in no way trying to or wanting to setup any kind of obligations or expectations or extra responsibilities. \n\nBut I realize now that me inquiring about that was doing the opposite of what I set out to do in the first place and what I had actually wanted to do which was to give her the time and space she needed to heal and grow and feel ready to be in a relationship. I genuinely wasn't wanting to or trying to further things along or make something happen or rush or pressure anything into happening but it felt like I was subconsciously doing that because I was scared about losing her both as a potential partner but also as my friend in my life. I just wish I had picked up on it sooner so I could adjust and correct my behavior. And now I realize the best thing I think I can do for ourselves as individuals and our relationship is to just take a big step back and just not say or do much of anything, like actually physically giving her time and space. It's difficult to do that though because I still want to strengthen our bond and nurture our friendship but I worry that me wanting to hangout so much, even though I just want to hangout and talk as friends, may come across as me wanting to make something happen. \n\nI realize that pretty much every girl I had ever asked out until this point either lead me on or rejected me and that when I received some reciprocity of what I felt for someone in some form or fashion, especially for one of my best and closest friends who I care deeply about, that I subconsciously latched on very quickly and very hard. And all that combined with my anxiety and fear of losing her made my mentality subconsciously shift into this weird heavy, serious, emotionally charged state without me even realizing it. And I still do want to talk about all this stuff, like where things are at and where things are going and to clarify what I was actually meaning because I feel like my words were coming across the wrong way. But I am fairly confident that there will be a time for that discussion, but that that discussion will happen when we both feel ready for it and when we both want it to and that its ok if that does not happen right now or in the near future. \n\nI am worried that I am ruining her perception of me and that what I had been saying may have come across as trying to set something up or further things along even though I was genuinely not trying to or wanting to. and I don't want to come across as some clingy, needy, desperate, pushy, loser and it feels like the best thing to do right now is to literally give her time and space and not say or do anything for a while, like maybe a month or two and then just check in and see how she's doing (not in terms of relationship readiness just life in general) and just pick things back up.\n\nIf you couldn't already tell I am a big overthinker and this whole situation has been giving me some major anxiety. I have never been in this weird gray area with someone before and it certainly does not help that it's with one of my best friends. And because everything about all of this is new and intimidating and scary for me I cannot gauge the situation and have no real idea about what's going on. Is not saying or doing anything the right thing? Did I ruin anything or am I ruining anything with her? Was it silly for me to have cried and been so emotional when I confessed my feelings?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I cried while confessing my feelings to my best friend and am worried that I am fucking everything up and that every step I take is me fucking it up even more (MAJOR ANXIETY). and if anyone has any further questions i can do my best to answer and clarify",

The first few days, he seemed to show genuine interest, giving lots of compliments, saying things like how he feels very comfortable around me, and such. It felt like we were starting to open up to each other more.\n\nBut it bothered me that whenever he says he's going to text, he doesn't end up texting at all. He says he tends to be forgetful, so I left it at that. I've asked if he has ADHD, although he said he hasn't been diagnosed with it. (He has shown other signs like being distracted by something in the middle of a phone call, or multi-tasking). It's already happened a couple times that he said he's going to text or talk to me later, but end up not doing so, till I hit him up the next day.\n\nI thought there was something that could come out of it with how well we've gotten along the first few days and him seemingly showing more interest. Is it worth sticking through it with someone who's acting hot and cold? Is it justified if I just stopped keeping in contact with him?\n\nWe've yet to meet up and have only spoken on the phone and exchanged some texts.\n\nTl;dr Guy I've been talking to who showed a lot of interest the first few days isn't as responsive anymore.

I'm finally starting to feel more happy, there will be times where I do think of him and get a bit upset but for the most of it I am more happier after a week. \n  We have told each other from day one that we will never leave each other ( I have now learned that that was a mistake and very unhealthy to promise) , but the fact that he said that and nearly broke up with me countless of times, ik he didn't mean it all them times but I had my doubt over the relationship from the very begining and he was always there to assure me we will stay together and we won't get hurt. But then he went and left so I feel like I have been stabbed in the back. \n  When he left me, he instantly left life360, blocked me on twitter, left out online calendar and ignored me for 23 hours at a time. It's like he completely lost all sense of care. He has has had something like this happen before where he stopped caring about us and just didn't care about what he said or did. I have been told before that if he had that feeling 2 times within the space of 6 months then that wasn't normal and wasn't gonna work out. \n  He wants to get back with me but honestly I missed being independent and making decisions myself, or not having to ask somone if I can do smt. But I also miss him. So I'm in between and I don't know what to do. Help meeee, what do I do? Part of me wants to get back with him and the other half of me doesn't want to. \n\nTL;DR : MY BOYFRIEND LEFT A WEEK AGO AND IM FINALLY STARTING TO ACCEPT IT, BUT HE NOW WANTS TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH ME.",

We talk every day though.  \n\nWhen we are together face to face our conversations are never stale at all.  We never run out of things to talk about.  But over text it's a whole different story.  I ask him how he's doing  and get generic answers like \"awake.\" Etc.  I ask how his day was... \"it was a day.\" And so I feel like I talk about myself and my day a lot just to carry on a conversation.  He just doesn't give me much to work with.  He has been really stressed out about finances lately so I don't want to add to the stress by telling him this bugs me a little.  \n\nIs there any way I could nudge him a little to open up more.

I had mentioned way prior to him asking me to be his gf, that i wanted to take things very very slow. as i just got out of a tremendously traumatic relationship in August of 2022 and i simply couldn't handle things moving too fast. I was thinking we'd like be friends (he only started paying attention to me towards the end of january, as in, showing me romantic interest) so things snowballed really fast. I am really horrible at maintaining my boundaries. And i regret it. Along with being very, very regretful of caving into the pace i wasn't comfortable with i will reiterate that i struggle with BPD and PTSD and it has been kicking my ass really hard lately.\na few other important things (the truly questionable things imo): it has been 22 days, and he's mentioned marriage. naming babies. moving in together eventually. and i am simply so scared of this. he knows i'm celibate but wanted to talk about me getting on birth control to which his response when i told him i refuse to damage my hormone balance, fertility and risk dark moods was buying condoms when i said that i'd like to maintain my celibacy. which he was celibate as well when i met him. but i feel like now that we're dating he just threw that out of the window. and so is every and any boundary unless i bring back to his attention that i'm not okay with it.\nThe major dilemma here: he isn't a complete POS. he opens doors, he pays when we go out to eat, plans thoughtful things... he's not mature and he's rather pushy and clingy (which scraped against my avoidant attachment style and my manic depressive episode in which i struggle to be a super affectionate and present human being during) an V he wants to \"help\" me.

        "text": "I get everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and opinions can change. When I first met my bf, he was anti-guns, anti-violence, etc. without getting too political, I believe having a gun does more harm than good, and several studies show that having a gun does not actually protect the owner and may even increase the risk of endangering the owner. I live in a place where they‚Äôre legal, even though they shouldn‚Äôt be.\n\nLast week, my bf got into a heated argument with his sister (let‚Äôs call her Anna). Anna‚Äôs boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him James) was on the phone, and he overheard their argument. James has several mental health issues. After overhearing their argument, James got angry at my bf and called the cops, telling the cops that my bf was assaulting Anna, even though he wasn‚Äôt. The cops came, spoke to Anna and my bf, and quickly realized that Anna was ok. They left. James called back and began threatening my bf, saying that he would bring his friends who have guns and teach my bf a lesson. My bf got scared and got a gun a couple days later from some guy from his old workplace (without discussing it with me) to ‚Äúprotect himself.‚Äù Note: my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt live with me, he lives with his family. His youngest sister has a history of self-harm but has undergone therapy. She‚Äôs doing better, but she has a history.\n\nI think James made empty threats. I also think the best way to approach this is for my bf and James to clear the air and speak to each other calmly over the phone. I don‚Äôt think getting a gun was a good idea AT ALL, that too from some random guy. And given his youngest sister has a history of self-harm, definitely was irresponsible and impulsive.\n\nThe gun is a dealbreaker for me, especially given the circumstances. I feel like this is a recipe for disaster, a tragedy waiting to happen. I tried explaining my concerns to him, but he won‚Äôt listen. He won‚Äôt return the gun.\n\nHow can I convince my bf to return the gun, attempt other solutions to the conflict he has with James, and still support him through this rough time?\n\ntl;dr: my bf‚Äôs sister‚Äôs bf threatened my bf, my bf got a gun from some random guy to ‚Äúprotect himself,‚Äù I don‚Äôt agree with his decision and want him to return the gun, but he isn‚Äôt willing to discuss period. Want to know how I can bring up my concerns and still be supportive during this difficult time",

( I know how hard it is looking for a job while being depressed on top of not taking medication because it worsens her depression). She has also told me that her parents do like the thought of her taking depression meds and recently they found out and threatened to take her PC away, they met up for dinner to discuss her depression and she said they were surprisingly nice and even offered to take her out of school if it was to much for her. I asked her before to make a new appointment with her doctor for new medication and she said she would but has yet to do it.\n   I keep trying to push this thought of breaking up with her to the back of my mind but every night I just think about it and I don‚Äôt know what to do . I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs t anxiety or depression . Side note I take medicine for my anxiety and depression as well\n\nTL;DR I (F19) am debating on breaking up with GF (F18) over recent issues and past issues",

        "text": "I will try to make this as short as possible. I have two ex-best friends that completely walked out of my life about a year ago this month. We were friends for about 7 or 8 years. When I moved to the town that I'm in now I had no friends except for them. So in the past 4 years I've lived here I only had them as friends and it was my fault for not making other ones and so they were all I had.\n\nWe did everything together in all my memories of the last 4 years are with them. They stuck by me through bad relationships, my own issues, and we had a lot of fun together. I was there for them through everything that they had going on and they were there for me. I basically told them everything about my life and we had no secrets between the three of us. We always went out on the weekends together, had movie nights, etc. Looking back I probably should have tried to make other friends here but I didn't really have the time or the will to do any of that since they pretty much took up a lot of my time and I was happy just being friends with them.\n\nI need to disclose that both of these friends are in the mental health industry. They went to school to help people with their problems, and they see patients everyday who are struggling mentally. This is important to the story.\n\nI will say that the relationship was pretty codependent between the three of us. I was definitely more codependent with one of the friends in particular and she was with me. It got to the point where she was overbearing and tried too hard to help me with my problems..as in, she would bring up my problems to make sure I was doing the right things, even when we shouldn't have been talking about me. It's like she always put me in the spotlight when I didn't ask to be there. She made everything about me and even when I made steps to improve my life she expected more of me. It was very much a motherly relationship and I tried several times to get her to back off with her concern. This friend also had insecurities of her own which I tried to help her through. But for the most part the relationship was very good, but if I had to say what any of the issues were it was what I described above.\n\nFast forward to last year around April and we had all gone out together for the night. Things have seemed kind of off and I sensed that my one friend was kind of upset or irritated at me for a reason I don't know. I started saying some things that kind of threw both of my friends off and they got super mad at me and we parted ways. They literally did not speak to me after this night. It was the most random thing ever and I could not believe that two friends wanted to ditch me because I was in a bad mood for the first time in a very long time. Meanwhile anytime they had a problem or in a bad mood I always would listen and be understanding towards them. It seemed like such a dumb thing for them to be mad about and I thought it would all blow over.\n\nIt didn't blow over. My one friend sent me a text message basically saying that she did not want to be friends anymore because all of her issues were my fault. She blamed me for her drinking because she said that my issues \"made her want to drink excessively.\" she blamed me for her depression and bad moods because she was always concerned about me. Again. NONE of this was anything I ever asked her to do. She had her own problems and while I was concerned for her I was not overbearing or letting it affect my life in any way because I knew that her life was hers and mine was mine and I would never blame my problems on her. It was just all a little bit insane.\n\nThe other friend I had basically did the same thing and she ignored me as well and I did not hear from either of them for the past years or so. \n\nWhen they walked out of my life I was left with nobody. The last year so has been awful and they know it. They knew I had no friends here they had knew I had no one to talk to besides them so when they decide to walk out of my life they know it was going to be hell on Earth for me and that's the part I can't get over.\n\nI even went to therapy for this. Given that we are all 29 and 30 years old I struggled to make other friends because like I said the last 4 years of my life has been spent only with them and no one else. When I went to therapy I made sure that I told my therapist everything about the situation including my role so that I did not seem like I was being biased towards myself and wanting to make myself look like the good guy and not take responsibility for my own actions.\n\nI read the text messages to my therapist just to give a idea and insight into the friendship period I read her my text messages and the text messages that my friend sent me when she told me she did not want to be friends anymore. My therapist looked at me and asked me why I would ever want to be friends with someone who would treat me like this and say all these awful and horrible things about me. And blame all of their problems on me. I took that as my son to let go and slowly I tried to make my own friends and pretended as if they were dead and I had no other choice but to move on. But I was still hurting. \n\nIt has hurt this entire time, especially knowing that I was betrayed by two people that I really cared about and thought that I could trust. It's a broken trust because they abandoned me for simply a night when I was in a bad mood and it felt unfair due to how much of their crap I put up with and sometimes even with them intentionally being mean to me, I never let it go past the day of me being mad. I always forgave. \n\nThey chose to walk out of my life for something so stupid. A night where I was in a bad mood and was not saying anything to hurt their feelings, instead was just expressing my own frustration at my life. Meanwhile when they've intentionally hurt me I forgiven and yet I was not intentionally hurting them or say anything negative to them and they decided that they did not want to be my friend anymore.\n\nIn the past year or so I force myself to make other friends even that's been very hard period I've made about one friend that I can do normal things with and then the rest of my friends I have now are all party friends that I can do stuff with on the weekends. I have moved on but I do miss having best friends. \n\nI've been having a pretty good time the last few weeks making new friends and going out with them. I don't have many friends but I've been grateful for the couple that I've made. \n\nWhich brings me to my question. I actually saw these two friends out this past weekend and they attempted to make the first move of trying to make amends with me. They invited me out to a different bar and I went with them because I figured if I didn't go I would always wonder what if. It was a very chill night and it was kind of like the nights we used to have but I ended up just going home after. The next day one of the friends texted me and asked if I wanted to get together to talk about everything.\n\nMy parents have advised me not to go because they think that the Betrayal was too great to forgive and that they really didn't care about my feelings or care about me because of what they did to me. They said true friends would have never abandon me the way they did period and the fact that they stayed away this long proves that they really didn't care about me at all and still don't period another friend of mine said to just go and see what they have to say and then decide if I could be friends with them again. \n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. If he became friends again I would always know that they didn't really care about me because of everything they've done to me. At the same time they have made the first move in trying to make amends but in the back of my head I'll always remember that they abandoned me for a year of my life and left me completely alone and depressed and did not bother reaching out one time. These two friends have also had each other this whole time. Also, being mental health professionals, they KNEW that the right thing to do was apologize. They're not stupid. I've had to get out and make new friends and do everything on my own. Something I know they could never do because they have been friends since middle school and have never branched out. If either of those friends had gone what I went through, they would have had a breakdown. I was knocked on my butt and still made it on my own with nobody. My family doesn't live here. However they know how much pain I've been in and that's why they are so skeptical of me going back to them. \n\nI told myself and all this happened that the only way in hell I would be friends with him again is if they made the first move to reach out and talk about things and if they didn't then I would never be friends with them again. And now that they've done it I want to hear them out but I'm wondering if it makes me a person of little self worth if I go and meet with people who I know intentionally hurt me for an entire year and did not care. I do miss them though and I wish this would have never happened so that everything can go back to normal and I wouldn't have to worry in the back of my head that they really don't care about me if we become friends again. Someone that cares about you would never leave you in the dark for a YEAR knowing you had nobody and knowing it would cause you to go into a depression and leave you in the worst position possible. What should I do?\n\nTL, DR: My ex best friends completely abandoned me for an entire year, leaving me alone in a new city with nobody and didn't bother to check on me once. Now they want back into my life.",

        "text": " \n\nMy (F 40's) boyfriend (M 40's), 'Craig', has had a few issues over the years. He was bullied in school, had some other issues with his family, and I think he probably suffers from depression or PTSD. He is not an easy person but is a good and decent person.\n\nA few years back Craig and I went to visit my father (80's), brother and sister, and it didn't go well. Craig was nervous, drank too much and I think went into 'fight or flight' mode, because he seemed defensive. It wasn't really that bad but he became a bit belligerent at the end of the evening (my father was asleep by this time).\n\nOn speaking with my father after the visit, I said that Craig had been a bit nervous but would be more relaxed next time. My father, however, said he 'never wants to see Craig again'. I was a bit shocked as his behaviour was really not that bad and I thought my father would be more understanding. I didn't tell Craig about this. For a couple of years I kept hoping my father would change his mind. It was awkward for me trying to visit my Dad (who lives a fair way away) without inviting Craig. Craig comes from a close-knit family and I am invited to all their events, so the situation was difficult for me.\n\nIt became obvious my Dad wouldn't change his mind, but I still didn't know how to tell Craig. I thought this wasn't really Craig's fault, and my Dad was over-reacting. Craig felt rejected by his own father, and I didn't want to put him in a situation where a father figure was rejecting him again. And I didn't want him to get depressed about it. He's actually extremely sensitive.\n\nAnyway, now my sister is getting married, and I know Craig won't be welcome at the wedding (I haven't even asked if he can come as I know the answer will be no - due to my Dad). It will be a very small wedding. I'm not sure how to tell Craig I'm going without him. I'm thinking of saying it's a very small wedding with only immediate family members. But wanted to know if that is a fairly common thing that would sound realistic to say?\n\nIf it comes down to telling Craig that my Dad has a problem with him, I'm thinking of framing it more that my Dad is a bit paranoid and for some reason has a phobia about him - which is not completely untrue, my Dad does get a bit paranoid. I really don't want to say that my Dad doesn't like him and never wants to see him again, as that sounds so extreme.\n\nAny other way I could handle it?\n\nTL;DR: My father doesn't like BF and doesn't want him at sister's wedding, not sure to tell him I am going to the wedding alone.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I‚Äôm new to Reddit, so sorry in advance for the REALLY LONG post. For the past 6 months, I needed some form of guidance, since I can't really talk about this stuff with my friends. Thanks for reading this, and I hope you all have a nice day :)\n\nI labeled each section in chapters -- **\"Intro\", \"Falling for Her\", \"The Rift\", \"Aftermath\", \"First Sight/Conversation\", and \"As of Now\".**\n\n***Intro:*** I (24M) got a job in spring last year, and was assigned to help someone (35F) with two projects (one main, and one side) for a couple of months. During the first few months, I was still familiarizing myself with this new work environment, with her showing me the ropes of what I was expected to do.\n\nMy first impression of her (I'll call her K), was that she was a beautiful lady, who takes absolutely no BS. A true professional, who knows what she wants in life, with beautiful eyes that can also put the fear of God in you. And I still think that to this day. She is also a very reserved person, which may be attributed to her having ADHD, which she has told me about within my first couple of weeks. She told me that she was taking medication for her ADHD, causing her to be hyper-focused. Because of this, she was a ‚Äúhead-in-the-books‚Äù kind of girl, and only came to work when she needed to, or when she was needed. Basically, she was there only for me (as she was training me), and for her personal meetings with the boss. \n\nThe first couple of months go by, I start to get the hang of things, and was acknowledged by the boss of how I was a good fit. And K and I felt that way too. As a result, K convinced me to extend my contract with them, under the same working conditions (i.e. working under K's project again). Believe me, I was ecstatic to be with her again.\n\n***Falling for her:*** Now this was where I started getting feelings for K (mind you, I have never been in any relationship before her). Working under her again, I became more comfortable with approaching her, and every time we were working together, we would always have talks about anything (our childhood, our ambitions, music taste, past relationships, etc), for HOURS. However, I noticed that I would always be the one initiating conversation with her, but she would always keep the conversation going. This was most likely due to her introverted nature. I never realized how much we had in common, which slowly made me become enamoured with her.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks into my extended contract, I would always ask K if she wanted to go grab a drink (not alcohol, usually coffee or bubble tea), and she would always immediately say yes. With her being such a reserved individual, I really thought that she wanted me to be a part of her life, which made me want to spend even more time with her. I really wanted her to be a part of my life (or even friends at the very least). With these mini adventures (and trust me, there were many) we had together, I thought that we really developed a bond.\n\n*Context: In the workplace, everyone is always busy doing their own thing, so it's kind of hard to schedule outings with other people. I guess being an assistant helped, since I was free when K was also free.*\n\nBut the most memorable moment for me, was near the end of the year (also near the end of my contract), which was also where the \"pseudo\"-love triangle started. I organized a mini party for the workplace at our local bar, and I invited K. For various reasons, she quit drinking alcohol during early 2020. Respecting her decision, I never forced her to come, but I told her that she was always welcome. Much to my surprise, she came to the bar, looking beautiful as always, even in a sweatsuit, and sat down beside me. She immediately tells me, and only me, that she has been going through some stressful stuff in her life that made it difficult to focus on her project, and that she was thankful I organized this event. \n\nAt the bar (4 pm), we all just start settling in, and she immediately orders a beer, which took me by surprise. At this point, we discuss our day at work. Most of it was actually our coworkers discussing K's progress on her project, to which she has been going above and beyond. They also tease her for having me as her assistant (an extroverted individual that loves going out to drink). Funny enough, she backs me up, and in the most genuine way possible, she says verbatim ***‚ÄúI love him. He‚Äôs absolutely brilliant, and there‚Äôs so much more I want to do on this project with him.‚Äù*** At that point, my cheeks are red (from both her and the 2 beers). Additionally, I start noticing that since we're sitting beside each other, our knees constantly touch, and it takes a while for either one of us to pull away (sometimes me, sometimes her). Also, being a reserved person, she was also much more physical with me (leaning on me, punching my arm when I made jokes), despite her always telling me that she didn't like physical touch.\n\nAfter 20-30 minutes, all of us start to request tequila shots, including her. After some hours, we are 6 shots deep. At this point, everyone else left, and it was me, her, and another coworker. Surprisingly I was still coherent, but it was apparent that she was tipsy (indicated by her uplifted mood), but also coherent. I wanted to go home, since it was cold outside, and the three of us went back to our workplace to pick up our stuff. We walked our coworker home, but we stopped after 1 km of walking, since we realized he lived another 3 km away, while our station is in the opposite direction. So, we say our goodbyes to the other coworker, and her and I are walking back. I was really happy to spend some alone time with her. And this was our first (and only) time having a late-night walk together.\n\nBeing a gentleman, I extend my arm out for her to hold onto, and she clutches it tightly. We're walking really slow, which I loved, seeing as I can spend more time with her. She starts apologizing to me about how she's acted within the past couple of hours, and if she said anything out of line. I told her, \"No, K. I was more than happy to see you there. I loved having you join us, and I wouldn't want to have a late night walk with anyone else except you.\" Afterwards, in a truthful and joking manner, I looked her in the eyes, and said \"I know it's late, but I'm going to buy you Krispy Kreme, because I know how much you love it.\" And the way her eyes lit up and looked at me, made me melt. Even better, she also said \"You're the best person I've ever been with.\" On our way to Krispy Kreme, K asked me on my opinion on a certain coworker (C2, referenced in next chapter), to which I said that they never think before they speak, and just talk speak their mind (especially relevant in next few chapters). After we got our donuts, we found a rugged staircase, and sat on it for almost an hour, and this was where the bad part began.\n\nAs we're sitting and talking/eating, I brought up the topic of past relationships, since we had a short and unfinished discussion a while back. After her and I both shared our stories, she told me something along the lines of her having multiple relationships (last one was 4 years ago, and her longest one was almost 6 years), but they all failed because of her \"quirks\" (K's words, not mine). Being curious (and somewhat hopeful), I also wanted to know if she was currently looking for a relationship. Immediately, she was disgusted at the thought of having a relationship, because she always wanted to be the \"rich, single aunt with no kids\". (Side note: She also had someone from the States that bought her stuff that she needed (only one thing, to my knowledge), and recently bought her a flower for Valentines Day). This kind of hurt, but it wasn't the worst part of the conversation. She then followed up her \"single aunt\" response by also saying that she found the other coworker (referred to as \"work crush, or \"WC\" -- the one we walked home for a bit) attractive. Not wanting to know, and slightly jealous, I also asked what attracted her to him, and she only said his looks and his biking hobby (since she is an avid cyclist). But she kept saying that it was a work crush, and that she would never act on it, mostly because she thinks that she was not his type. Honestly, I wasn't really bothered by her having a WC, otherwise that would be hypocritical. Shortly after, we got up, and we went back to our usual talking phase, and walked back to the station in an hour. Honestly, I loved every minute of that walk, and that is the memory I still cling to, to this day (with the exception of WC). Much more happened, but once we got to the train station, we parted ways (didn't hug her or anything, respecting her dislike of physical touch), and I texted her to be safe and text me when she got home, which she did early next morning.\n\n***The Rift:*** *There was one more bar meetup that I organized with our workplace a couple of weeks later. This is actually where a rift came in between me and K, but it wasn't due to me, as I found out later on.*\n\nSame people, same location. However, WC was unable to join, because he was busy. At this point, her having a crush on WC was water under the bridge, so there was no ounce of jealousy in me.  Again, respecting her wishes, I didn't force her to come, but told her that there's always a seat for her. Funny enough , she showed up to the bar before us (partially my fault, because I told her to be there at a certain time, and we left our workplace much later), looking pretty with her black clothes on. I only showed up with another coworker (referred to as C1). We settle in the bar, and immediately, I can tell that she is much more hyper-focused than the previous time we were at the bar, since she had a stoic face on her 24/7. I wasn't in the best of moods (for personal reasons), so most of the initial conversation was between her and C1. This was actually where K started to change her perspective of me. \n\nMe, K, and C1 start off by discussing our day. However, C1 says something to K that gets her irritated, but I was preoccupied, and didn't hear exactly what was said (I'll elaborate further in the \"**First Sight/Conversation**\" chapter). For the next 15 minutes, there was this palpable tension between C1 and K that I was completely unaware of. Afterwards, the rest of the coworkers came (including C2). And exactly like last time, the conversation steered towards her project. But something's different this time. Last time, she talked about her project because she was comfortable talking about it. Here, C1 and C2 started interrogating her about her work, asking very nuanced questions that made her feel flustered and suffocated. Standing her ground, K's attitude became very cold and dismissive, where it was obvious that she wanted to the conversation to end. So, while I was sitting beside her, it was apparent that she didn't want to talk to anyone else. Even after all that, C1 and C2 were oblivious to K's emotions (which makes sense, since she is like the female version of Captain Holt), and kept talking to her, only to get hit with a 3 words-or-less reply. These short responses are usually how she responds to others, except me, so I thought nothing of it. The whole night was a blur for me, mostly because I was distraught, which led me to barely speaking with anyone, including K. This get-together felt much more different than the previous time, which turned out to be the case, which I'll explain in Aftermath.\n\n***Aftermath:*** But here is where it starts going downhill. Remember how K said that she wanted to do many more things on this project with me, in the future (refer back to \"Falling For Her\" Chapter)? Reminiscing on that moment, I was looking to extend my contract at this job again, under her once again. Fast forward to 2023 (4 weeks before the end of my contract), I was approached by the boss, and was completely sidelined when he told me that K didn't need me anymore. \n\nI felt backstabbed. What happened to working together for a long time? I found it completely unprofessional and unlike K when I had to find out my job was at risk from the boss, and not from K herself. Funny enough, K was always advocating for me to the boss, in hopes for him to keep me full-time for her only, and always praised my competency and proficiency.\n\nI couldn't believe it. For two weeks, I felt like shit. I kept processing what the boss had told me, and I felt so many emotions at once, to the point where I avoided opening up my \"Messages\" app, because I would see her name at the top as part of the pinned chats. I was constantly wavering between anger and sadness. After those two weeks, and some advice from other coworkers, I reached out to her, and asked her if I could continue working with her. 3 days later (on a Friday), no response. \n\nAt this point, I was livid. However, I knew that there were many other people in this workplace that were willing to accept me as their assistant, and was able to secure my job placement through another extension, just not under K anymore. While it hurt to not be with her anymore, I had this feeling where I was just a used toy for her to throw away, which kinda made it easier for me to leave her and find someone else's project to work on, albeit emotionally overbearing. \n\n***First Sight/Conversation***\n\n*Context*: *K has been really busy working on the writing portion of her main project, so my help wasn't needed as much. As a result, she wasn't really present at the workplace as often, as she was working from home. Because of this, I sometimes hung out with C1 and C2, as they were always available. Knowing this, K thought that I became close friends with C1 and C2.*\n\nWith my first ever position outside of K's assistant, I was somewhat alleviated that my job wasn't at risk anymore, and I VERY slowly started to feel better. The Monday after the 2 weeks of emotional torture, I open the door to the workplace, and immediately smell K's perfume and see her back, and a huge wave of emotion just washes over me. Heart rate speeds up, and all I could muster up was a simple, \"Hi, K\", and walked out, full of anger. All I got, was a simple \"Hi\" back, with her back turned to me, never even bothered to look at me.\n\nTurns out that the side project I was helping her with since last year was up and running again (it was delayed for a bit, for the main project), and I found out from others that she'll be at the workplace more often. So much for \"out of sight, out of mind\". In addition, the boss asked for WC to be on K's team, as my \"replacement\", since K didn't need me anymore. Although it was not WC's fault for being assigned to work with K, I just couldn't help but be jealous and angry at WC for taking my spot, when it's clear that I was more qualified. \n\nFor the next couple of days, I saw K everywhere, and I tried to speak to her, and all I got were simple 1-word replies from her, immediately making me think that something happened between us. But what really solidified this feeling was that when I asked her out for some bubble tea/coffee, she said \"no\", and that's it. That was the first time ever that K has rejected me for drinks. \\*cue sad songs playlist\n\nAnother two weeks go by, and K is showing WC how to do a certain task, a task that I used to do for her, which showed how replaceable I was to her. Knowing how long that task takes (from personal experience), I wait for X minutes at my desk, and I go to her office, with the hopes of having at least a 2 minute conversation, to get some clarity as to what happened between us. I knock on her door, and immediately ask her if she's busy. K says yes, ready to leave, but I immediately tell her that I need to get something off my chest (basically what I said in *\"****Aftermath\"***). I knew that she held contempt for me in her words, with how much emotion were behind each and every word. I had to keep prying, because she wouldn't tell me the reason why she was upset with me. \n\nEventually, I found out that the reason for her lack of communication was for three reasons, one minor and two majors. The minor reason? She thought my contract ended much later, so she didn't bother responding to my email in the meantime. The major though? Goes all the way back to the previous get-together (i.e., ***The Rift***), going back to that \"palpable tension\" between C1 and K. Turns out that C1 said to K something along the lines of K not being supportive of their coworkers when they got promoted, and that K wasn't happy for them. K made it abundantly clear (to me) that she supported the promoted coworker way before C1, and that C1's comments were uncalled for, which was true, as C1 is a relatively new hire for the workplace. The second major reason was that C1 and C2 kept interrogating K about her project. K said that C1 and C2 asked very specific questions that made her feel doubtful of whether she belonged in this workplace (i.e., Imposter Syndrome), and that I was in kahoots with C1 and C2 to make K feel like less of a person. Hurt by the fact that K would think that about me, I kept reassuring K that I never would do anything like that, and that I was always hers. Also, because K was always absent, I never got to hang out with her, and I don't want to distract her. K kept thinking that I was being disingenuous, and that she doesn't listen to people's words, only their actions. Knowing that I never lied or hid anything from her before (we always communicate any problems with each other), she knew that I was being genuine, and gave somewhat of a half-assed apology for how this whole thing was handled. I could still sense some slight doubt/contempt, but it was better than me avoiding her for the rest of my contract. \n\nSurprisingly, this conversation was for 2 hours, and it kind of felt like old times. It was obvious that both of us needed to blow off some steam, so I guess we both got some clarity from this discussion. The first 15-20 minutes was us getting things off of our chest, whereas the rest of the 2 hours almost felt normal. Not 100% like it was last year, but one step closer.\n\n***As of now:*** Fast forward to today, I'm slowly starting to feel better. Even writing this down is helping a tremendous amount. But, ever since that first conversation we had after our \"separation\", we have been hanging out every couple of weeks, back to our good ol' coffee/bubble tea adventures. Just recently, we went shopping together, and had \\~1.5-2hr long walks, something I haven't done with her in months. However, these quality time moments we had were much more frequent, and less awkward. \n\nBut what really sucks to know is that this falling out we had was so preventable, had we talked immediately after, rather than waiting 2 months, and putting my job on the line. In addition, knowing that it wasn't my fault, but C1/C2's fault made me kind of shift my perspective of them as well, not to the point of disliking them, but being less friendly/more professional around them. But, given K's tendency to avoid confrontation, I still found it unprofessional of her to leave me hanging.\n\nAs for K's side project, C2 recently spoke with WC, my \"replacement\" on this project, and C2 (being the mindless speaker he is), asked WC's thoughts on K. Just when I thought that WC and I were cool for him taking my spot on K's project, he immediately says that he found K attractive, but didn't want to act on it, because she never said anything to him (*Context: When WC and I were cool before seeing K for the first time, I told him how I felt about K's lack of communication, and he implied that she wasn't a good person)*. Honestly, I can't blame WC for finding K attractive, because she really is. But WC is the \"player\" in our lab -- he has many love interests in mind, and K was never one of them, until recently. There's more to this story, that I would love to share, but this is getting too excessive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***End:*** Again, I'm really sorry for the long post, but this girl has been plaguing my mind for the past 6 months, and it's annoying how much time I spend thinking about her everyday, even though I don't work with her anymore, just in the same vicinity. It also makes me question my identity in this workplace, since I always identified myself as \"her assistant\". Also, it feels like it's a chore for her to talk to me now, since I'm getting left on read, despite her acting much more friendly in person.\n\n***TL,DR*** \\- Spent a lot of quality time with my coworker that I worked under, and fell for her HARD after half a year. Found out that she had a \"superficial\" and temporary crush on another coworker at the time (not anymore, according to her). She put my job security at risk, because of others' actions that were outside of my control. I was able to get some 1-on-1 time with her, and clear the air about what happened. But now, I'm not her assistant anymore (I'm someone else's assistant at the same workplace), and her new assistant is her previous work-crush, at the boss' request. Now, he's working under her for a different project that she and I have been working on for months, and I'm pretty sure he is falling for her the same way I did. I recently learned that her ex-work crush also thinks she is cute, but never wanted to pursue her since he was getting mixed messages of her not wanting to spend time with him. Also, he has shown to have many love interests in mind, and she is not one of them. Now that I am helping other coworkers out on their projects, I don't work under her anymore, but I still have feelings for her, seeing her almost every week. Moreover, her and I are slowly starting to hang out again, but not as often as before. I feel like I'm relapsing back again for her. I understand that we're not dating, and that I can't control who she can/can't see, but it's hard to ignore all the things we did together. What do I do?",

        "text": "My girlfriend (Alex) and I have been dating for  nearly two years now. She comes from a very traditionally catholic, Mexican household. I‚Äôm her first girlfriend so things have been rough. \n\nShe‚Äôs a college student that studies at a university a few hours from our home town. During the first six months of our relationship, she would stay with me every weekend and make it a point not to tell her parents she was in town because she couldn‚Äôt explain she was staying with me because her parents didn‚Äôt know she was gay. We couldn‚Äôt go many places or run errands in town due to the fear we may run into them. We went to get groceries once and her parents happened to be in the same parking lot and she sunk to the floor boards of the car and demanded we left. And when we were out together we couldn‚Äôt show any type of PDA because she didn‚Äôt want anyone telling her parents about us. \n\nSix months go by and she wanted me to come to her graduation. I told her I‚Äôd only go if she‚Äôd tell her parents about us. And if she wasn‚Äôt ready, then that was okay but I wasn‚Äôt going to go to make it. I felt like if I was going to risk running into her parents I wanted to be there as her partner and I didn‚Äôt want to be introduced as anything less. \n\nThe entirety of this time she had kept me a secret was difficult for me. I had been out of the closet since I was 12. My traditional Mexican parents didn‚Äôt take it well. I spent the next 6 or so years dealing with physical and verbal abuse from them. I mean, my life was a living hell but never did I deny who I was for a second. So being with someone who felt it was easier just to be quiet about it was uncomfortable. I know how hard it can be and I don‚Äôt wish anything I went through on anyone. I allowed it for a while until she could gain the confidence to do it but at some point I felt like she‚Äôd have to come forward about it. She wasn‚Äôt 12, she was 21. I felt like I was disrespecting myself by allowing someone to make me feel so hidden and denied and she didn‚Äôt have to come out if she didn‚Äôt want to or wasn‚Äôt ready to, I just couldn‚Äôt continue to compromise my own feelings over it any longer.\n\nShe ended up coming out and her parents weren‚Äôt happy but they didn‚Äôt react badly. Over time I figured I‚Äôd be able to meet them at some point but it‚Äôs been nearly two years now and they pretend I don‚Äôt exist which is honestly really hurtful. My family is so good to my girlfriend. They treat her like their own. Her parents won‚Äôt even or acknowledge my presence. \n\nThe thing is like I said previously, my family hasn‚Äôt always been accepting. My last girlfriend wasn‚Äôt so lucky. I had to force my family around her. I didn‚Äôt care if they were uncomfortable. We didn‚Äôt display any PDA to be respectful, but I brought her around anyways. There were times where I was asked to have her leave and I left with her. If they wanted me around they had to accept everything I was not just the parts they want to. \n\nAlex and I have had several disagreements because the entirety of our relationship, my family has been so welcoming. She comes to every family function and she‚Äôs never not with me. But I‚Äôm not allowed or even invited to any of her family functions. She just goes without me which feels really disrespectful. \nFor thanksgiving and Christmas, she said she was going to spend it with her family and mine. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt invited to her family gatherings and I accepted it as long as she also spent the holidays with mine. She didn‚Äôt show up until the last thirty minutes of each holiday and most of my family had already left. I spent the holidays feeling sad and alone and like my partner didn‚Äôt care enough about how it all made me feel. \n\nAlex stays with me in a city six hours away and she visits and stays w her parents once a month for two weeks or so. But we‚Äôre talking about actually moving in together. Shes been talking for months about how she wants to get married and start a family. I just don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever put me first, let alone a child we have together. What is she gonna do? Go to her family functions and leave me and our kid at home? I don‚Äôt want her to have to choose between me and her parents but at some point isn‚Äôt that what a partner should do? At this point it just feels so cowardly to me and I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask my partner to put me first. Am I overthinking this entire thing or should I actually be upset? \n\nTL;DR   My partners parents don‚Äôt like our relationship so they refuse to acknowledge my existence and don‚Äôt invite me to their family functions and my partner goes with out me. Am I over reacting?",

        "text": "\nTL;DR I‚Äôve been formally dating this girl for about 3 odd months now but known her for close to 5 months. I see a lot of mixed signals when meeting in person vs texting (changing over time) which have me confused and worried because I really like her. Also, she does text a lot of guys friends all the time.\n\nWhen we first started dating the energy was consistent whether we met in person or over text. We texted for hours thorough the day but that seemed to have slowed down with time which I understand may naturally happen as well. I am the more romantic of the two and love to express how I feel over texts which gets rarely reciprocated in kind. \n\nHowever in person when we meet over weekends and she stays over, it‚Äôs a totally different experience with the passion and intimacy which is amazing.Except I‚Äôve seen this gradual change in communication energy when we‚Äôre not together during the weekdays. Also, I usually am the one initiating the idea of meeting and there is some resistance initially but eventually she makes an effort to travel 60 miles one way almost each weekend to meet and spend time. \n\nOn a side note, I see her texting her guy friends or atleast she calls them that who send her kissy emoticons and call her all endearing names. This happens when she‚Äôs texting sitting right next to me. I don‚Äôt sneak into her phone but just caught a glance as she was texting. Also she‚Äôs always protective of it and keeps telling me she‚Äôs addicted to it. She‚Äôs even told me stories of how these friends (individually) have been in her life for the longest period of time and she shouldn‚Äôt have to change her connection to them because of someone new. \n\nI‚Äôve had a clear communication with her if she‚Äôs into this 100% and she‚Äôs said she will never keep me in the dark and will be clear in telling me the day she loses interest and does talk very sensibly whenever I raise this and assures me i have nothing to worry about and I want to believe that‚Äôs the truth. I don‚Äôt want to be the controlling paranoid boyfriend (maybe I am) who is insecure but I see all these mixed flags and don‚Äôt want to be caught offguard one day. Please tell me I am completely wrong or paranoid about this when I don‚Äôt need to be.",

I have this little voice in the back of my head that keeps telling me to break up with her and the other telling me not to do it because I‚Äôll regret it. In the past she has done some questionable things like crashing my car (minor damage was done, she hit a parked car and I forgave her). She also told me she had feelings for her best friend (F18) who rejected her but said best friend started leading her on in the past.

How long should I wait before I pursue him?\n\nOn Thursday last week I finally told my now ex-bf that I was done. I haven't been happy with him for years and I should have done it a long time ago. I don't think he's a bad person, in fact I still care about him very much, I just wasn't happy for multiple reasons, including being completely unsatisfied in the bedroom and feeling neglected in general. He has not been taking it well and I feel bad but I know I made the right decision and I haven't regretted it once.\n\nHowever, *part* of the reason I finally pulled the trigger is that a coworker of mine, one of my supervisors (28M) had been paying a lot of attention to me. His attention has made me feel special and wanted in a way that I haven't felt in a really long time. He is always asking about me and how I am doing or feeling. He is constantly doing or saying silly things to try and make me smile. He often gives me very kind and thoughtful compliments. Last night I gave him a ride home from an outing with some coworkers because he was drunk. He made a comment about how something I said made him feel like we were a married couple, and he joked about proposing to me. Earlier in the evening when we found ourselves alone together for a moment, he joked that he was going to confess his \"true feelings\" to me. This makes me think he might be interested, among other things.\n\nTo be honest, I am not used to being flirted with, so I'm not actually sure if this means anything? So in your opinion, is it possible he might be interested in me? And if so, how long do I need to wait before I can try pursuing him in earnest?",

        "text": "My bf and I decided we wanted to let our friends get to know each other. His friend being Caleb, my friend is Amber. Caleb is \"shy\" as my bf said and hasn't dated anyone in 3 to 4 years after breaking up with his ex-gf. Amber hasn't dated anyone since we were in 12th grade so we thought it was a great idea. My bf thought we should make a group chat with the four of us and we did. Now group chat is now 3 days old and just earlier, Caleb sent a photo of a naked girl's upper thigh from the back with a red hand mark from being smacked. The girl wasn't wearing anything below as her buttocks is almost showing. My bf said \"looks like a man's bum\" to which Caleb responded \"opposite sex tho.\" Then my bf replied \"don't send that here bro.\" I didn't know how to react. A lot of things was going through my mind:\n\n1st: He must be with another girl or sleeping with another girl which if I knew beforehand, wouldn't let Amber get to know this person as I don't want that kind of guy for my friend;\n\n2nd: What if it's his ex-gf from years ago? Why would he send a body part pic of his ex in a group chat? That's so messed up and it's not unlikely my bf would do the same if we ever break up.\n\nI hope I'm just overreacting (internally). I wanted to say something to my bf about it but I don't know how to approach the subject. Is it my business to discuss these things about his friend? They have been friends since they were in middle school but I know my bf doesn't want to get involved in very personal things for he has one time had a really huge fight with his other best friend (from the same circle of friends) as he ratted him out to the gf that his bf is cheating on him. What to do?\n\nTl;dr My (24f) bf's (22m) friend (22m) sent a weird pic in our groupchat and I don't know how to react.",

        "text": "I'll keep it straight to the point without making you lose your interest. I crucially need honest feedback.\n\nI (F18) want to completely stop being in contact with my \nfriends and I've never thought about it until recently.\n\nCONTEXT: I used to hang out with a friendgroup that consisted of 5 girls back in middle school. I haven't seen 4 of them personally since our graduation 3 years ago. The only time we've spoken are when we wished each other happy birthday through chat and we'd drop a comment under each other's Instagram posts occasionally.\nThe thing is, I often used to feel left out. I know why‚Äî I chose a boy over the friendship between me and one of them. I was selfish back then and I apologized for it.\nThe said friend is a very sweet person and forgave me for my mistake but I still felt really guilty and I did everything I can to make up for it. I was a huge people pleaser back then as well lol.\nAfter that, they weren't mean or stuff but sometimes I can just sense the fakeness as if they're being friends with me because they pity me. Sometimes one of them would even say something about me e.g. my insecurity, they'd laugh about it even when I'm literally there and when they try to defend me it's like they don't even try.\nIt has caused a tremendous trauma on me that I'm still healing from currently.\n\nAfter graduation I've seen them have birthday parties and go on trips with our other middle school friends. What doesn't click to me is that they invited everyone we knew except for... me?\nAt first I thought: \"Okay maybe they didn't have enough place or budget to invite one more person\". It did sting me but I let it go eventually. But it happened two, three more times and I'm starting to really believe that they're leaving me out intentionally. It obviously triggers my trauma and realizing it makes genuinely upset which made me come to this point.\nThey could've atleast ASKED me if I wanted to join, right??\nNow, I know everyone has their own right to decide who they want to invite. I promise you I'm very aware of these things and I respect it because life has taught me a lot over time. But recently there was a reunion and I wasn't invited, again‚Äî that was my last straw.\n\nYes, it may sound like I'm cutting them off because I'm being petty. But I also want to cut them off because I want to protect my peace. I can't constantly forcefully put myself in their lives simply because I want to feel included. It's toxic and exhausting for my mental health.\nBonus point: THEY don't have to deal with me anymore entirely and I'm more than enough at peace with that.\n\nAm I valid for what I'm feeling?\nAm I being reasonable enough to continue this decision?\nOr should I just let it go, realize that I'm the problem and continue working on myself?\n\n\nTD;LR: Am I being reasonable to cut ties with people who I THINK are repeatedly leaving me out on purpose or am I just doing too much?",

        "text": "TL;DR: I caught my ex kissing a mutual of ours two weeks after we broke up, what should I do?\n\nTwo weeks ago, my ex (18F) and I (18M) broke up because things just weren't working between us. We would argue all the time and constantly bicker back and forth and it was exhausting, so naturally it ended. Apparently later in the relationship, she knew she was going to break up with me so she did all of her grieving and accepting of the death of our relationship while we were still together. This is all something I could understand and deal with, but things got complicated when within a week she started obviously developing feelings for a guy who is in a lot of our classes. We had decided to stay friends (which was the first big mistake in all this) and no matter how many times I asked her she told me he was just a friend. Despite the constant signals, I believed her. That's until today when I saw her making out with him in his car. It hasn't been a month and I've barely started processing the end of our relationship and she's already found someone new. It's not like I can just drop her either, because we share half of our classes together and are seated next to each other in many of them. I've fully cut her off and told her exactly how badly her actions have hurt me and I'm fully on my own now, lost. My body aches and I can't sleep or do anything because it's just plagued my mind. I am so hurt, lost and heartbroken and I have no clue what to do from this point other than the average \"focus on yourself\".\nYeah, I tried, and I can't think of anything other than the smile on her face after she kissed him. Please help, Reddit, because I have no clue what to do next.",

In that time our relationship has obviously grown some but he hasn't proposed to me or even began to discuss having a family (outside of weird fetish stuff I guess he likes imagining)\n\nHe basically always tells me he's not ready or he's afraid of what his parents will think. I feel it's completely unfair that I have to put my life on hold any longer because he puts all of his preferences first. Hes always telling me how he worries kids will hold him back or he hasn't proposed to me yet because it's not the right time or he'll say \"I'm going to at some point just not now\" but it's been 13 years?!\n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm being strung along. I've tried to separate from him a few times now because of this but he INSISTS he's going to change and says things like \"if I leave I know you won't speak to me anymore or let me see you\" and I try to tell him that, yes, that's true because I want to move on\n\nI'm convinced at this point I could've found someone who loves me better and who is going my pace years ago, but he just won't give me the space to have that opportunity and I feel I see more of my life disappearing.\n\nHe's not a bad person in any way, not violent, very kind and generous and considerate, it's just when it comes to the pace of the relationship not only does it feel like he has full control over the speed at which anything occurs it also feels like we're in stagnant limbo because he doesn't know what to do with himself\n\nI'm very much in love with him and thought he was my soulmate but now I have no clue what to think. It's been 13 years. I feel like a joke. I'm ready to be married and have a family and it seems he doesn't care about that at all and just says whatever he can to get me to drop it for another few days/weeks\n\nI don't know what to do üòû I love him üíî\n\nTLDR My boyfriend isn't letting our relationship move on or take the next steps but he's also not making separation easy or possible at all",

We didn‚Äôt block each other on any social media platform whatsoever. We are on pretty good terms and did text semi-regular. I had tried to cut off friendship from him a few times because I still have feelings for him. He had told me back in September that he didn‚Äôt have feelings for me.\nHe and I had texted last Wednesday and it led to me being invited over. He told me over text that he didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I lied and said I didn‚Äôt have feelings for him anymore. I went over and it felt like old times. We talked and caught up one another on everything that has happened. He remembered the little stuff.\nThen, he was the one initiating everything such as wanting me close and holding me. I did tell him that we were just friends (even though I still have feelings for him.) we ended up hooking up and we haven‚Äôt talked since last week. \nI feel like I‚Äôm overthinking it now; he has watched my stories and all of that, but I feel as if I messed it up.\nWhat do I do from here? Do I let it be?\n\nTL;DR saw my ex after a long time and now I am overthinking it.",
