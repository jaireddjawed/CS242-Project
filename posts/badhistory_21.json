        "text": "If you are still subscribed to /r/todayilearned, there is a good chance you've seen this post crop up in the past 24 hours.\n\n[Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4rfgmq/til_that_after_the_treaty_of_versailles_ferdinand/)\n\nWhile I concede that it is quite impressive how closely Foch predicted the date of the \"next war\", it is not for the reasons many posters appear to believe. For one thing, half of the contributers to that thread do not seem to realise that Foch was angered by the *leniency* of its terms rather than its perceived harshness. For another, we get a story emerging about how the punitive terms of the peace the Allies dictated inevitably led to the rise of Hitler and the start of World War II.\n\nNow I know this is well-trod ground in the realms of badhistory and askhistorians, but the message still doesn't seem to be getting through that many of the public perceptions and traditional narratives of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles are deeply flawed.\n\nAnd so we get posts like this being upvoted:\n\n&gt; There was no real way to \"be harsher\", Germany had already failed to deliver on many points of this treaty only years after WW1 to the point were France asked to invade / invaded / occupied in 1923 German territory in hopes/expectancy of being able to enforce these terms when in reality there was in most cases just nothing more left to get. I am pretty sure there will be some /r/askhistorians who can list up point by point how bad Germany looked in many parts which would make the financial crisis of 2008 look like a fucking Picknick with desserts. After enduring this for years and tensions bubbling below the surface internally Germany at some point just turned around, refused most payments they didn't/couldn't or from this point on wouldn't deliver any way and went full nationalism as you might know.\n\nCredit to /u/poiuzttt for pointing out the irony of appealing to /r/askhistorians in order to argue that Germany was badly treated by Versailles. In fact, the narrative has changed since the 1960s when Weimar era documents became available indicating that Germany deliberately exacerbated its economic difficulties in the early 1920s in the hopes of forcing renegotiatians. In the words of Sally Marks \"the Reich Chancellory archives indicate that in 1922 and 1923 German leaders chose to postpone tax reform and currency stabilisation measures in hopes of achieving substantial reductions in reparations\". And then later, from the same article, \"It is evident that Germany could have paid a good deal more if she had chosen to do so\". As I have said before, France occupying the Ruhr to extract reparations is not evidence that Germany *could not* pay, only that it *would not* pay.\n\nFurthermore, the traditional \"Versailles caused WW2\" story seems to ignore that by 1933, when the Nazis came to power, reparations had been postponed indefinitely. The rise of Hitler was much more closely tied to the global economic depression following the Crash of '29 than it was to the reparations demanded by Versailles.\n\nSo why is this narrative so pervasive? Well, a key factor is that this is very much an example of the NOT-victor writing the history. As Holger Herwig writes, \"from June 1919 through the Third Reich, key elements of the German bureaucracy mounted a massive and successful campaign of disinformation that purveyed false propaganda\". The narrative that is taught in many schools (in the UK and the US) is actually the one that the Germans wrote to foster international sympathy in the 1920s - which was accepted wholesale by British writers who felt the best way of preventing another war was to help Germany prosper peacefully.\n\nNow this is getting a bit longer than I intended, but I can't go without also paying lip-service to the ever-infuriating General-bashing that crops up in every WW1 thread:\n\n&gt; To be fair, [Foch] was also wrong about a lot of things.\n\n&gt; \"I bet wasting the lives of hundreds of thousands of my men in the same sort of attack we've tried 10 times will work this time around!\"\n\n&gt; Most of the generals on both sides of that war would have served their nation best by putting a bullet in their own heads.\n\nNo, by and large, WW1 generals were not incompetent idiots who tried the same approach over and over again, not realising that it wasn't working. Combat tactics evolved constantly throughout 1914-1918 and the idea that it was a stalemate is a gross oversimplification and misinterpretation of what the opposing armies were trying to achieve. One only needs to look to the British army, which changed from a mass of poorly trained conscripts in 1916 fighting in waves, to a highly-drilled force pioneering the beginnings of modern platoon tactics and combined arms warfare. Losses were always going to be high when armies of millions of men armed with machine guns squared off against one another - and the rate of casualties between WW1 and WW2 was not as different as most people suspect.\n\nSources: \n\n*The Myths of Reparations* by Sally Marks (article)\n\n*Clio Deceived* by Herwig Holger (article)\n\nAlso various posts from /r/askhistorians (including, but not limited to):\n\n[link1](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3b24mk/treaty_of_versaillesmyths_of_reparations/csiqo30)\n\n[link2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33dlep/did_harsh_economic_sanctions_help_hitler_gain/)",

        "text": "In [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/4qn0y4/til_cofounder_of_vice_media_is_a_roman_catholic/d4uhh5a?context=3) from /r/Catholicism, which is, most certainly, a trainwreck, I found [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CXIIgLSWsAAvI4U.png), helpfully entitled 'Serf vs. Wagecuck'.  BEHOLD ITS GLORY.\n\nI mean, most people would look at the term 'wagecuck' and rightfully dismiss this as ignorant balderdash, but still.  BEHOLD ITS GLORY.\n\nDone beholding?  Good.  Let's go down the list.\n\nThe painting used to depict 'serfdom' does no such thing.  It's a work by a 20th century German painter named [Adolf Wissel](http://alchetron.com/Adolf-Wissel-1300681-W).  Adolf was, as it happens, an actual, card-carrying Nazi; his work was meant to portray an idealized version of rural life in accordance with the National Socialist ideology of [*Blut und Boden*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Soil).  More, his works feature German peasant families of the late 19th or early 20th century (I'm sure an actual German historian could narrow it down more specifically), while serfdom was abolished in Germany between 1770 and 1830.  Actual medieval serfs looked [something like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reeve_and_Serfs.jpg).\n\nUnder the painting, the creator of this image makes certain claims about the lives of serfs.  To wit:\n\n&gt;marry a 17 yo virgin with the finely sculpted body only regular physical labor can imbue\n\nWell.  Um.  Exercise and a good diet makes people shapely.  Hard labor breaks them.  I don't have statistics on the physical appearance of serfs, but I have lots of old family photos (early 20th century) of people who spent their lives on their farms, and 'finely sculpted' is not the word I'd use.  As to the rest, well, 17 is [in the right age range](https://books.google.com/books?id=5PqIeLIgstkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=serfdom+age+marriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D3mJP_TpKd&amp;sig=sLb_O8O33qPHewwSckELDh0x6s8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB4bCQ2NLNAhVQ-GMKHWUrAUYQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=serfdom%20age%20marriage&amp;f=false), but [virginity?  Depending on the location, not so much](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y9ygc/how_was_marriage_between_peasants_in_europe/).  Peasant teenagers, it seems, would do [a lot of sleeping around](https://t1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/33/27/62/400_F_33276290_shkfCxikeU8aFpSVM6ItBMGLJPv2mK6U.jpg), and when a girl got successfully knocked up she'd marry the (probable) father ASAP.  I'm inclined to imagine teenage serfs doing similarly, even though, in most places, [there were restrictions on serf marriage](https://books.google.com/books?id=o82wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=serfs+marriage+restriction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qu69w_H4YT&amp;sig=npLz90T3Gs_zcWTmUWuh9QL9h5w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji656L1tLNAhUW7WMKHRGwBD8Q6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=serfs%20marriage%20restriction&amp;f=false); more, though [this bit of propaganda](https://books.google.com/books?id=HrBbAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=serf+breeding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9cw8iBP0f-&amp;sig=b59OK6S9CkMf9p_Pfa1cAZPEkXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYrfuy1tLNAhVM42MKHZyIAAYQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=serf%20breeding&amp;f=false) is probably exaggerated, it's likely that [serfs in Russia](http://www.sras.org/serf_petitions_freedom_russia), as well as other places, were sexually as well as physically abused by their masters.  \n\n(Yeah, an intellectually honest comparison between serfdom and wage slavery would involve the relative frequency of *beatings* and *rape*, but when the word 'cuck' comes into play, you know that intellectual honesty has already gone out the window.)\n\n&gt;1/3 of days feast/celebration days\n\nThis one [is actually true](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html) - at least in some times and places - but misleading.  The author is trying to compare serfdom with modern 'wage slavery', i.e. the standard 40-hour week, and counting Saturdays and Sundays off (2/7 days) gets one close to the feast day schedule (2/6 days), and then you factor in vacations, holidays, sick days...  and I would note further that a serf owed labor to his lord *first*, and then would go home and labor on his own fields/crops.  While the average number of work *hours* might be the same, working sunup to sundown in the baking sun (during planting and harvest) is not exactly comparable to eight hours in a cubicle.  And, again, [this depends on where and when you were a serf](http://www.sras.org/serf_petitions_freedom_russia) - accounts from Russia claim that serfs would be called to labor sunup to sundown on their masters' fields, leaving them only the night to cultivate their own.\n\n&gt;live in a warm, high-trust, multigenerational household\n\nThree generations in one room with a dirt floor and infrequent bathing.  Lovely.  Again, true but idealized - serfs were not necessarily any happier with their marriages, families, mothers-in-law, etc., than people today. \n\n&gt;no modern information technology to interfere with your religious belief - you have no doubt that eternal paradise awaits you upon death\n\nIgnorance is bliss, huh?  Leaving aside the whole bit about 'modern information technology' being responsible for religious doubt (unless we're talking about the printing press - hi, Martin Luther!) I'd just note that hope of eternal paradise went hand-in-hand with fear of *eternal damnation*.  More, I want to emphasize that ignorant doesn't mean *stupid* - peasant and serf communities were hotbeds of religious debate (what else do you do after dark?  Besides screw?), which sometimes led to [heresy](https://books.google.com/books?id=eTEj0T6u7zUC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=french+peasant+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbCjWSxO0o&amp;sig=ym93NnrQ9b1pqIIDcdXIlvjEnzo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHkKb139LNAhULxGMKHYzeBtUQ6AEIUTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20peasant%20heresy&amp;f=false) or encouraged [open revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Murderous,_Thieving_Hordes_of_Peasants).\n\n&gt;eat natty grassfed dairy and organic produce every day\n\n... if, by organic produce, you mean [grains in various forms](http://people.eku.edu/resorc/Medieval_peasant_diet.htm), sure.  Dairy, yeah, [cheese and butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_cuisine#Dairy_products) were common, and [livestock](https://books.google.com/books?id=30vGxyWbK1IC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=serfs+russia+diet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6IHT0VRNE7&amp;sig=_DIC9rdPCT_jb11htu-V7e83_zg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl3omP4dLNAhUH8mMKHf7sCfIQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=serfs%20russia%20diet&amp;f=false) supplied important nutrition.  Which is awesome, when there's water to grow crops and grass for livestock to eat.  In the winter?  During droughts and famines?  Not so good.  [Famine was common in the Middle Ages](http://www.medievality.com/famine.html), and serfs, the products of whose labor went first to their masters, always got the short end of the stick.  \n\nYeah, yeah, low hanging fruit, I know.  But sometimes the low hanging fruit is so juicy and delicious that you just have to bite.",

She became known as She-Wolf of France. Mortimer and Isabella would put Edward II's favorite (and probable lover) Hugh Despenser the Younger on trial and watched him get castrated, hanged, drawn and quartered. She and Roger ruled England as regents for four years until her son, Edward III, overthrew them in a coup.\n\nOh, where do we begin?\n\n* \"Had him assassinated\" is by no means uncontroversial.  Some suggest (e.g. Ian Mortimer in *The Greatest Traitor*) that his death was faked, others that he died of natural causes.  It is true that most historians believe that he was probably murdered, though.\n* \"by shoving a red hot poker up his arse\": this is almost certainly a later fabrication.  The earliest accounts of Edward's death have him dying of natural causes or being suffocated.  I don't think that any modern historians seriously believe the red-hot poker story.\n* \"was then ironically nicknamed Edward Ironside\": **Edmund** Ironside was the king of England in 1016, overthrown by Cnut. According to wikipedia, he was known as Ironside \"because of his valour\".\n* \"it was well attested that Edward II was gay\": \"gay\" is a problematic term for someone who lived half a millennium before the concept of being gay as we know it today began to develop.  It certainly wasn't \"well-attested that Edward II was gay\", because it wasn't a category that medieval chroniclers would have understood.  Edward II not only had a son by his wife, Isabella, but also an illegitimate son. (Though he may well *also* have had sexual relationships with men).\n* \"Edward II's favorite (and probable lover) Hugh Despenser the Younger\": Edward II's favourite who is usually considered a likely lover was Piers Gaveston. Isabella and Mortimer did both hate the Despensers, but in that they were joined by a significant proportion of England's nobility.  I don't know of any historians who have suggested that it was because Despenser and Edward were fucking.\n\nI leave other bad history in the thread as an exercise to the reader.",

        "text": "After last week's Wondering Wednesday, I got a-wondering about the history presented by the Confederate monuments. Since I'm posting here, you probably know the answer already.  The below statues all come from like 10 minutes of research. The context for the statues comes mostly from *Race and Reunion.*\n\nDavid, F. Blight, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory.\" Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 2 (2001).\n\n--------\n#MISC\n\n**Lexington, Kentucky - Monument to \"General John H. Morgan and His Bess\"**\n\nMorgan's favorite steed, Bess, was a lady horse. If you checked, and I know you would, you'll see the statue is hung like a horse. Let me make this perfectly clear - this lady horse statue has a [penis](http://imgur.com/voAaJMB). [Source](https://goo.gl/OXjPRj)\n\n**Helena, Montana - [Confederate Soldier Monument](http://media.salon.com/2015/08/helena_fountain.jpg) - built by the UDC in 1916**\n\nThe monument has the distinction of being the northernmost monument to the Confederacy, though Montana was neither a state during the late unpleasantness nor contributed any soldiers to Confederacy. During the war, Montana's gold did help fund the Northern war effort and several Union units were raised.\n\n------\n#Faithful Slaves\n\n**York County, South Carolina -  [Faithful Slaves Memorial](http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=42188) - 1895**\n\n**Arlington National Cemetery - Confederate Memorial with [loyal slaves](https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2013/07/17/commemorating-faithful-slaves-mammies-and-black-confederates-pt-2/) - 1905**\n\n**Harper's Ferry, West Virginia - Monument to [Heyward Shephard](http://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2012/09/HeywardShepherdMem_web-600x274.jpg) built by the UDC in 1905.**\n\n**Mebane, North Carolina - [Faithful Slaves Memorial](http://docsouth.unc.edu/commland/features/essays/ray_wise/) - 1922**\n\nThe plaque in the Mebane memorial, dedicated almost 60 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, reads:\n\n&gt;IN MEMORY OF / THE FAITHFUL SLAVES / MANY OF WHOM WERE MEMBERS OF / HAWFIELDS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH / AND ARE BURIED IN THIS CEMETERY / \"BE THOU FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH AND I / WILL GIVE THEE A CROWN OF LIFE\" REV. 2:10 / THIS TABLET IS PRESENTED BY THE FAMILY OF STEPHEN ALEXANDER WHITE / AND DEDICATED BY THE HAWFIELDS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH / 1908 – 1922\n\nThough 1922 seems late to exalt the faithfulness of slaves, the plaque is not an outlier of its era. Nostalgia of faithful slaves was so powerful that the Senate passed a bill in 1923 that allowed the United Daughters of the Confederacy(UDC) to build a \"faithful slave mammies\" monument on public land. Fortunately for us, the House shot that down. While a narrative of faithful slaves may look bananas to us now, the UDC and other Lost Cause organization had spent years gathering \"accounts\" of content slaves. According to David Blight, who should always be referred to by his full title - Professor David Fucking Blight:\n\n&gt;In dialect poems written in the voices of loyal slaves, in “darky” minstrel performances, and in unpublished family reminiscences, white Southerners strove to convince themselves that emancipation had ruined an ideal in race relations. . .\n\n&gt;Lost to near oblivion in white memory by the early twentieth century were the countless wartime testimonies of planters about “defections” and “betrayals” of their most trusted slaves.\n\nThis replacing of the horrors of slavery with a story happy and loyal slaves, some so discontent with freedom that they hope heaven is a land of black bondage, was a key component to the Lost Cause narrative. These monuments are that idea made stone. The kissing cousin of the \"faithful slave\" is the \"Black Confederate Memorials\" which exaggerate or obscure the nature of the support Black Americans gave the South. Here is one to [Willis Howcott](https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=willis+howcott+memorial&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1185&amp;bih=581&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4P_H4sLNAhXDX5QKHULZDlsQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=8GipTfeAdYTaIM%3A) and another for [Henry Dad Brown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-waymarking-images/f06a08f4-95db-4ae3-903b-114acba952bc.jpg), who \"enlisted\" in the Confederate Army despite that fact that it was illegal for black men to do so. Another such plaque attached to a confederate monument reads:\n\n&gt;“In Memory Of Union County’s Confederate Pensioners Of Color. .\n\n&gt; [List of Ten Names]\n\n&gt;In Honor Of Courage &amp; Service By All African-Americans During The War Between the States (1861-65).”\n\n It also include 10 men's names. The monument makes no mention of the fact that the men were coerced into service and only lists the ten men who happened to receive a small pension later in life even though they labored alongside thousands of other enslaved men and women. The dedication was in [2012](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9085517.html).\n\n------------\n#State's Rights and Immunized Motives\n\n**Texas State Capital - Austin, TX - [Confederate Monument](https://jonathanturley.org/2010/11/06/confederate-memorial-in-austin/) - 1903**\n\n**South Carolina's Monument at [Gettysburg](http://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/confederate-monuments/confederate-state-monuments/south-carolina/) - 1965**\n\n**Houston, Tx - [The spirit of the Confederacy](http://www.houstontx.gov/parks/artinparks/imagesBig/SpiritOfTheConfederacy1.jpg) -1908**\n\n**Richmond, VA - [Jefferson Davis Memorial](http://www.examiner.com/article/monument-avenue-the-jefferson-davis-monument-richmond-va) - 1907**\n\n**Romney, WV - [Confederate Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Memorial_(Romney,_West_Virginia)) - 1867**\n\nI don't really want to do the R2 about why the above monument's exaltation of state's rights is bad history because it's been well covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/0) and [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom_(book)). Instead, let’s go over why the United States is covered with Confederate monuments that teach a whackadoodle view of history. In the years following the war, the was huge push by both people in the South and the North to create a narrative of the war that, as Professor David Fucking Blight notes, was \"immunized from motive\". This narrative was also the handmaiden of North/South white people reconciliation - by focusing on the heroism, bravery, and valor of both sides whites could move past the causes of the war to join hands in common cause as white Americans. This is reflected in the many, many monuments. \n\nThe first major Confederate monument was a statue of Stonewall Jackson unveiled in 1875 in Richmond,  VA. During the dedication ceremony, the governor of the first \"redeemed\" government,  or openly white supremacist Democrat after the war,  declared the statue to \"stand forth a mute protest before the world against the rule of tyrants...\"\n\nFifteen years later another major statue came to Richmond - Robert E. Lee atop a 60 foot marble base. The dedication brought 100,000 to 150,000 people out and Northern and Southern newspapers alike declared Lee to be the \"truest of Americans\"  and a \"possession of the American people\". \n\nBy the time the early 20th Century's monument building spree began, the Lost Cause narrative was a dominant one, hence the engravings that focus on the [glory and heroism](http://civilwartalk.com/attachments/campbeau_-007-jpg.15951/), [glory](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uYhwjSHoQ3k/S_KMIdkW0iI/AAAAAAAACYI/OiHn4XIPNlE/s640/100_2966.jpg), [glory]( http://monumentcity.net/2009/04/01/confederate-soldiers-sailors-monument-baltimore-md/ ), [bravery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_Confederate_Monument), and [glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_City_Confederate_Memorial) of the men fighting for ~~an empire of slavery~~ state's rights.  [Here](http://civilwartalk.com/threads/inscriptions-on-confederate-monuments.85120/) are many more example of the genre.\n\nThese statues, as public exaltation of the Lost Cause, were more than just rocks to hide the cause of the war under. They were public justification for the political order, Jim Crow, and white supremacy. \n\n The first decades of the 20th century was an era where *Birth of a Nation* was a giant hit, and the Dunning School of reconstruction historiography reigned supreme. Professor I'm the Goddamn Eric Foner [states](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/opinion/sunday/why-reconstruction-matters.html?_r=0):\n\n&gt;[The Dunning School] provided an intellectual foundation for the system of segregation and black disenfranchisement that followed Reconstruction. Any effort to restore the rights of Southern blacks, it implied, would lead to a repeat of the alleged horrors of Reconstruction.\n\nAnd in Lost Cause mythology, the antebellum South is the paradise to Reconstruction's fall. So once black civil and political rights were put back under the control of white supremacy, \"White Southerners,\" \n[according](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/08/historians-debate-value-and-place-confederate-monuments-and-other-symbols)\n to Professor Jane \"Rhymes with Pain\" Turner Censer at George Mason University, \"showed their power by dominating the space with martial monuments.\"\n\n\n____\n____\nBonus Fact: In Kentucky, a border state that remained in the Union and sent three times as many men to the Union army than the Confederate, there are 62 Civil War monuments. 55 are for the Confederacy.\n\nEdit: Lee's statue is 60 feet total,  not just the base.",

        "text": "I am the guy from \"Military History Visualized\" a rather new YouTube Channel, I use mainly academic articles and books to produce videos on Military History. Recently I watched a video from Extra Credits that basically repeated German war-time propaganda and also completely missed the scope of the title. In my response video someone suggested to post here, so I contacted the mods. Below is a link to my video, the original video and the script (note that is intended to be listened too, also formating maybe not ideal.)\n\nLink of my response video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a46ieMjtCY\n\nOriginal video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOXbYAd6TLo\n\nMy script:\n\n**Intro**\nWell, time for another response video and in this case it is necessary, because it has more than 200 000 views and nearly nobody seems to have noticed the errors in the video. Furthermore, unlike my previous response video about machine guns the topic of strategic bombing is way more problematic and crucial due to its larger influence on the war and ongoing political debates in Europe.\n\nBefore I start, due to some people claiming that I may be affected due to my Austrian background, my main source on the Battle of Britain for this response video is Richard Overy’s Battle of Britain – Myth &amp; Reality. For those who don’t know Richard Overy is a well-known British historian who currently is a Professor at the University of Exeter. \nhttp://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/staff/overy/biography/\n\nFor the parts where I argue against the very positive and uncritical portrayal of German forces, I use texts from German Military Historians, which I also use when I argue about the effectiveness of Allied bombing, which was certainly more effective than portrayed in the Extra Credits video.\n\nBy the way, I don’t claim that I am independent nor objective, because those are really strong and quite unrealistic claims, unless someone is living in the 19th century. Of course I aim at producing objective content, but I think it is more of an on-going process than a state that someone can reach.\n\n**Overview**\n\nNow, I fully recognize that Extra History has a complete different approach towards History and also a quite different presentation style, but it crossed far too many lines with the “strategic bombing” video. The gravest errors are:\n1)\tAt two times they are repeating German war time propaganda and stating them as facts.\n2)\tBasically, the video only deals with the Battle of Britain and terror bombing instead of strategic bombing nor the more important campaigns after 1940. Which leads to\n3)\tNamely, completely missing that the certain aspects of the Allied Bombing campaign were very effective and actually did had crucial influence on the war.\nThese misrepresentations can be easily used by various political motivated persons for their causes and due to current events in Europe this topic will be a matter of debates more often.\n\n**Main Part** \n\nSo let’s get started with the propaganda that is presented as fact:\n\n**Nazi Propaganda repeated as facts**\n\nFirst, right around minute one it is stated that \n“one small island stood together against the greatest military force the world had ever known” (01:07)\nNow, let’s make one thing clear the German Armed Forces the Wehrmacht was not “the greatest military force the world had ever known” especially not in summer 1940. During the Battle France in 1940 the German army consisted of 10 tank and 6 motorized divisions. Yet, the brunt of the forces of 61 infantry division on foot with mostly horse drawn equipment that were fully operational and another 66 division that were not fully operational. (Frieser, Karl-Heinz: Die deutschen Blitzkriege; in: Wehrmacht: Mythos &amp; Realität. (S. 184))\n\nAlthough the number of tank and motorized division changed later in the war, sometimes this was also due to having less tanks in one division than in 1940. So in general, the German Army throughout the whole war had severe lack of motorized and mechanized equipment.\n\nFurthermore, the term “greatest” has a very positive connotation, now I am not a subscriber to the “German-Guilt faction” nor am I a subscriber to “the German Forces were Great faction”, both of these groups are pretty similar in their narrow-mindedness, their lack in nuance and their oversimplification of complex matters. History is not a Che Guevara T-shirts, thus its portrayal needs more than just two colors.\n\nThe second time Extra Credits basically repeated war-time propaganda was, when they mentioned the decision of Hitler to order large scale attacks on London after the British bombed Berlin:\n\nIn this case I will just quote Professor Overy:\n“The decision to launch attacks on London rested with Hitler, but all the preparation was in place long before.” (Richard Overy: Battle of Britain – Myth and Reality)\n\nAdditionally, he points out:\n“The raids on Berlin may have affected the timing of the decision, but even this is doubtful. At most they allowed German leaders what Goebbels described as an ‘alibi’ […]” (Richard Overy: Battle of Britain – Myth and Reality)\n\n**Fail in scope and not covering Strategic Bombing**\nNow, since we settled the unintentional propaganda, let’s move to the next part, the misleading title or mismatching content.\nThe main message of the video is basically: terror bombing doesn’t work. Well, but the title is Resource War IV – Strategic Bombing. Strategic bombing and terror bombing are NOT the same, furthermore the video basically covers nothing about attacks on resources or the distribution networks that were needed to transport them. Something that should be the core of the video, because the Allied bombing attacks against German fuel production and transport networks were very effective during the later stages of the war and had a significant impact on German ability to wage war.\n\nThe failure to address this is quite problematic and leads us to the next part:\n\n**Neglecting crucial lessons about the Allied strategic bombing campaign**\n\nNotably, neglecting crucial lessons and developments of the Allied strategic bombing campaigns.\nThe most important points that were neglected:\n\n1) In World War 2 strategic bombing was to a large degree still in its infancy and barely understood. This is very similar to the development of artillery combat in World War 1, which went from  complete ineptness to developing principles that are used up to this day.\n2) It doesn’t mention how effective the strategic bombing against the fuel and transport networks were in limiting the Germans ability to wage war. \n\nThis information is crucial to reach a more balanced point of view concerning the strategic bombing campaigns, because they were not just terror bombing nor solely focused on military targets. It is a highly controversial and difficult topic in itself even without simplifying the matter or political views thrown into the mix.\n\nTo give you a glimpse on both the ineffectiveness and effectiveness of strategic bombing, let’s take a look at the following remark of the German Military Historian Horst Boog:\n“One of the most decisive Allied successes in the bombing campaigns, the crippling of the German fuel supply, was achieved with only about 0.6% of the bombs dropped on Europe and about 1.3% of the bombs dropped on Germany. Yet, to achieve this decisive goal in the last months of the war, it required years of experience and preparations even in other areas of warfare.” (Boog, Horst: Die strategische Bomberoffensive der Alliierten gegen Deutschland und die Reichsluftverteidigung in der Schlußphase des Krieges; in: Müller, Rolf-Dieter (Hrsg.): Der Zusammenbruch des Deutschen Reiches 1945 – Erster Halbband – die Militärische Niederwerfung der Wehrmacht. S. 801)\n\n„So wurde einer der entscheidendsten alliierten Erfolge im Bombenkrieg, die Unterbindung der deutschen Treibstoffversorgung, durch nur 0,6 % der über Europa insgesamt und über 1,3 % der auf Deutschland abgeworfenen Bombenlast herbeigeführt. Um in den letzten Kriegsmonaten die entscheidenden Treffer anzubringen, hatte es allerdings jahrelanger Erfahrungen und Vorbereitungen auch in anderen Bereichen der Kriegsführung bedurft.“ (Boog, Horst: Die strategische Bomberoffensive der Alliierten gegen Deutschland und die Reichsluftverteidigung in der Schlußphase des Krieges; in: Müller, Rolf-Dieter (Hrsg.): Der Zusammenbruch des Deutschen Reiches 1945 – Erster Halbband – die Militärische Niederwerfung der Wehrmacht. S. 801)\n\nI will cover the air war in further detail in the future, but for now I hope this addresses the most crucial points. \n\n**Final Words**\n\nNow, Extra Credits, I know that errors can happen, I made quite some of my own, but in this case there were far too many and crucial ones, especially considering your large amount of subscribers and extra spotlight you got from Paradox. I think you should at least rename the video into: “Why Terror Bombing didn’t work” or something along those lines, because neither “strategic bombing” nor the “the resource war” are really covered in your video. Also maybe add some annotations to those parts that basically reproduce propaganda.\n\n\n",

Some of these seem innocent, but I found one that jumped up at me!\n\n## **FUN GARLIC FACT NUMBER 20!**\n\n&gt; Egyptian Slaves Built the Pyramids on a diet of Garlic, Bread, and Water.\n\nFirst off, the Egyptians who build the Pyramids, and by 'The Pyramids' I am assuming the Giza Pyramids, were **not** slaves. Or not close to any cultural definition of the word.  They were rotating workers who did not toil under masters who had complete control of their life. The Ancient Egyptians apparently had a very complex rotating system for workers, and its a pretty cool read. Would recommend reading about this stuff from this [article](http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/07/who-built-the-pyramids-html).\n\nThat was the warm up! Next up, Egyptian ~~Slaves~~ Workers feasted not on Garlic, Bread, and Water, but on **Meat, Meat, and MORE MEAT**. I wouldn't be surprised if they used garlic as seasoning, as we do now. I have no idea about the spread of garlic over Africa, and if anyone apparently has this information, then wow, that's oddly specific and I love that you know that!\n\nAnyways, archaeologists, the Historian's adventurous, rebel sibling, have excavated the near by work camps and found loads of animal bones.  \n\n&gt; It had to be enough to sustain the workers through grueling days, weeks, years. Research led by Richard Redding, a research scientist at the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, has helped shed light on the answer to this question. In short, the builders ate meat. Lots and lots of meat. Often with a side of meat.\n\n&gt; “They probably had better diets than [people] did in the village. They definitely had more meat,” said Redding, (’71, Ph.D. ’81), also chief research officer and archaeozoologist at Ancient Egypt Research Associates (AERA), a nongovernmental organization that runs a field school at the Giza pyramids.\n\n&gt; Redding’s team made the discovery of the meat-heavy diet based on **175,000 animal bones** and bone fragments found at the Giza pyramid settlement\n\nJesus Christ that is a *lot* of meat. Source is [here!](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/lsa/ci.thedietofpyramidbuilders_ci.detail). Its a pretty nice little read! Apparently a large swath of area just turned cattle farms to meet the demand of the farmers. Cool stuff!\n\n**Update the score board!**\n\n   | Badhistory | Garlic\n:--- | :---: | :---:\nScore | 1 | 0\n\nAlso, for more fun, you can go have a look at the pyramids in [google street view!](https://www.instantstreetview.com/@29.976921,31.135228,-25.71h,1.67p,1z).

        "text": "Hello! Hope you guys had a good weekend! If you haven't already, read up on [Badhistory's highest up-voted post of all time, by the esteemed Georgy_K_Zhukov](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/), which I used for inspiration. It breaks down pretty much all other Lost Cause mythos.\n\n# **Preamble**\n\nThis may not be a usual badhistory post of \"quoting something really wrong written by someone\", and then explaining why it is. Instead, this is a general debunking of a the common Lost Cause myth that the 'South' was 'left behind or not represented by the federal government or being forced to change by the north led federal government'. I'll define it better in a bit, but the reason I am doing this is because this line of thought appears to make sense at a glance, like a lot of 'Lost Cause' ideologies, but as soon as you look past the surface, it breaks apart. Debunking this myth is also important because of all the analogies people like to throw around these days in politics. Or even pushing the reason of secession away from 'slavery and the future of slavery', and onto 'federal interference'. I have also seen many people who aren't on the Lost Cause train ^^^choo ^^^choo!  sprout this as a way of humanizing the Confederacy's actions, so debunking this is actually more important to me than the standard 'States Rights' affair because its something that people who know the Civil War=Slavery thing may believe. Anyway, enough of this shit, to the fun part!\n\n## What is the Myth?\n\nIt takes many forms, but here are some of the tenets: \n\n- \"The South felt like the federal government was taking advantage of them because of their smaller population, and they were a minority in the government\"\n\n- \"The Federal government didn't respect nor understand the Southern way of Life\"\n\n- \"The Federal Government was ignoring the South's Needs\"\n\n- \"The Federal Government didn't represent the South\"\n\n- \"Many in the South felt as though their voices are silenced by a completely opposite majority.\"\n\nI mean these look alright don't they? They aren't red flags like \"Lincoln hated black people\" or \"The south was going to get rid of Slavery anyways\". At worst they just make you question the authors motives, but you can see how maybe a person can accept some of these as facts, even if they think the Civil War was all about slavery. \n\n## **Laying the Foundation** \n\nFirst, let me prove that the **Democratic party was the party of the South**, to give my argument a bit of back bone. \n\n#### The Democratic Party\n\nAuthor Note: This whole part is just to equate the Southern agenda of protecting slavery with the Democratic party of 1840s-1861~. So I go down a bit of a rabbit whole. Skip if you want. \n\n* The party evolved from the short lived Democratic-Republican Party, organized by Thomas Jefferson in opposition to the Federalist Party\n\n* As Wikipedia states:\n\n&gt; The party favored republicanism, a weak federal government, states' rights, **agrarian interests (especially Southern planters) [ME: aka Slavery]** and strict adherence to the Constitution\n\n* [17/20 voting Democrats in the Senate Voted Yes for the a tougher Fugitive Slave Act bill in the Compromise of 1850. The 3 that voted no? From the north.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/31-1/s246)\n\n* [101/116 voting Democrats in the House of Reps Voted Yes for the tougher Fugitive Slave Act bill in the Compromise of 1850. The Dems who didn't were all from north states](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/31-1/h377). Its important to note that 28 of the Yes Democrats were from Northern States, and the Democrats who did vote down were all from the north.\n\n* From 1840 to 1861, many smaller parties formed with anti-slavery expansion mindset. This led to some north Democrats changing to other parties, but southern stuck with the Democratic party. The party adapted a pro-slavery expansion along side this. \n\n* God I swear the majority of southern state governments were controlled by Democrats for the large amount of time. But I can't find any statistics before 1900 about party control. If anyone can help me here that will be great. \n\n* House of Representative Party Composition to Geography, This should show how much the Democratic party came to represent the South, and how powerful the party was to being with. You may see the Yellow Whig party on these graphs. The Whig party is notable because it collapsed due to the slavery-expansion question that divided its members. The southern Whigs gravitated to the Democratic party or the Constitutional Union Party:\n\nYear | Map\n-----------|--------------------|\n1859-61 |    [It looks very north Republican V South Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_United_States_Congress#/media/File:36_us_house_membership.png) | \n1857-59 | [Divided again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35th_United_States_Congress#/media/File:35_us_house_membership.png) |\n1855-57 | [The South embraces a bit of color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_United_States_Congress#/media/File:34_us_house_membership.png) |\n1853-55 | [Its a blue World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33rd_United_States_Congress#/media/File:33_us_house_membership.png) |\n1851-53 | [Yellow and Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33rd_United_States_Congress#/media/File:33_us_house_membership.png) |\n1849-51 | [Yellow and Blue] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_United_States_Congress#/media/File:31_us_house_membership.png) |\n\nThe final point is a great example of showing how the Democratic party was the south. Southern citizens elected Democrats to represent them in Congress. \n\nThe Democratic party has a very interesting history that is filled with splinters. There are really two types of Democrats in 1850 to even past the war. There are those who truly believe in extending and protecting the Southern Way of Life, and there are others who are there for other factors. So when ever Slavery becomes a pivotal factor, many northern Democrats jump ship to the opposition, or just decide not to vote. However, this doesn't make the Democratic party any less about the south, in fact, I would say it reinforces the notion that the Democratic party of 1850~ to the Civil War were the embodiment of the south. As those who weren't on board with slavery jumped to other parties that represented their anti-expansion feelings. So through this 20 year process of culling, what remained was a much more South friendly party. \n\n\nSo, the Democratic Party embodied a lot of Southern Interests, and its southern definition became more and more prevalent as the issue of slavery became more and more of a problem.\n\n## **Rebuttal** \n\nOh shit, what were we doing? Oh yeah. The whole myth of south being forgotten. \n\nMy thesis is that the 'South' wasn't forgotten, or overlooked by the Federal Government. **They [The Democratic Party] were the Federal Government all along!**. What a twist! I will prove this using my cunning use of tables!\n\n**Were Democrats In Charge?

This is going to be Wikipedia snippets, so don't expect A+ Historian work.\n\n*John Quincy Adams (NATIONAL REPUBLIC)* \n\nSlavery? He didn't like it. \" Adams became a leading opponent of the Slave Power...\" [wikilink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams)\n\n*Andrew Jackson (DEM)* \n\nFuck yeah he supported Slavery, and disregarded freedom of speech when it came to anti-slave literature in the south. [wiki link for the lazy fool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson#Anti-slavery_tracts)\n\n*Martin Buren (DEM)*\n\nWell he is an interesting fella. He ran as Free-Soil (anti-slavery) later in 48, but while he was actually president he completely supported slavery. However, he did stop Texas from joining because he didn't want to upset the North/South balance. Goes to show that not all politicians are power hungry for their cause. [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren)\n\n*William Henry Harrison (WHIG)*\n\nHarrison had a very nuanced view about slavery that is really interesting and we shoul- Oh fuck he died. Moving along.  \n\n*John Tyler (WEIRD)*\n\nThrust into presidency after his Predecessor's demise, Tyler didn't have that many friends in congress. Tyler didn't like slavery, but thought it was completely up to states to decide. Even though he wasn't a DEM, he didn't do anything to restrict or limit slavery. \n\n*James K. Polk*\n\nVery much pro slavery. Was criticized for supporting Slave Power, the worst super power of all time. [tada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk)\n\n*Zachary Taylor*\n\nAppears to be very neutral to slavery. Had slaves, but didn't push for more slavery in territories, and didn't prevent it either. Believed that the president shouldn't interfere (veto) what the congress does. [Jesus, if we only had emperors I wouldn't have to link to so many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor)\n\n*Millard Fillmore*\n\nAn anti-slavery moderate, who supported the Compromise of 1850. Didn't go to far out of his way to stop slavery. \n\n*Franklin Pierce*\n\nStarted the whole 'Bleeding Kansas' thing. Was disliked by many northerners because of that. \n\n*James Buchanan*\n\n\"In the northern anti-slavery idiom of his day, Buchanan was often considered a \"doughface\", a northern man with southern principles.\" Not really sure how to sum this guy up. He was from the north, but did nothing to quell the incoming storm. Lincoln and others accused him of being part of the Slave Oligarchy. Lets just say he definitely didn't hamper the south in any way at all. \n\n#Supreme Court!\n\nLast and definitely not least! Lets see what the Supreme Court was up to! The court was called the Taney Court, and was considered to run from 36-64. \n\n*Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842)*\n\n&gt; [held that the Federal Fugitive Slave Act precluded a Pennsylvania state law that prohibited blacks from being taken out of Pennsylvania into slavery, and overturned the conviction of Edward Prigg as a result. #statesRights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prigg_v._Pennsylvania)\n\n*Strader v. Graham (1851)* \n\n&gt; [was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the status of three slaves who went from Kentucky to Indiana and Ohio depended on Kentucky law rather than Ohio law.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strader_v._Graham)\n\n*Dred Scott (1857)*\n\n&gt; [\"a negro, whose ancestors were imported into [the U.S.], and sold as slaves\" whether enslaved or free, could not be an American citizen and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford)\n\n*Albeham V. Booth (nullifcation) 1859*\n\n&gt;  [Court held that State courts cannot issue rulings on federal law that contradict the decisions of federal courts,overturning a decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableman_v._Booth)\n\nTo my understanding, there were no trials whose outcomes limited slavery during this time.\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\nWow. What a ride! Well as a recap. I was trying to break the myth that the 'South had been ignored/forgotten/left-behind' by the government, that was controlled by the ~~Evil Empire~~North. This, however, is completely false. **The Democratic party, which was the party of the south, controlled the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court, the VAST majority of the time!**\n\n- The Democratic Party controlled **both** House and Senate for 11/17 sessions! \n\n- Democrats had two/thirds or better control of the House/Senate/Pres Trio **83%** of the time!\n\n- Democrats had 8 sessions of **TOTAL CONTROL** of H/S/P compared to the 1 of their opposition, and during that 1 session, the anti-slave President died and was replaced by a more hands-off one. \n\n- The decade leading up to the Civil War was either 2/3 or 3/3 controlled by Democrats.\n\n- 7/10 of 4 year terms were under a Democratic President\n\n- The Supreme Court was actively ruling in Southern States favor.  \n\nThe notion that the Southern States were being 'left behind' is a really silly. They were being represented by the more and more sectional Democratic party, who held the government in a near Iron Grip. This was something that the republicans called **Slave Power**. Slave Power wasn't a secret cabal, it was just the fact that a large majority in the Federal Government were in favor of supporting Slavery, one way or another. This group continued to make the northern states bend over backwards with rules and regulations that valued Southern States' rights directly over other States'. The Democratic party, and Slave Power wasn't even getting weaker when Lincoln showed up. Hell! If Lincoln became president he may have been a lame duck with a Democratic congress that ignores him and maybe overturns his vetos! Of course that scenario never happened because you can't hold a majority when you're in active rebellion. \n\nWe need to shift the memory from the inaccurate 'Forgotten South' myth, to what I believe is the more accurate:\n\n'Southern planters didn't get what they want, and are scared about the future of slavery, so they go home, spread fear mongering with their peers that the damn republicans will not stop until every free, voting, black man is raping your daughter, and, on their own volition, ignoring all forms of, you know, diplomacy and compromise, start the bloodiest event in fucking American History, **WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THE PRESIDENT, THAT AMERICANS VOTED FOR, A GOD DAMN CHANCE, THEREBY IGNORING THE WHOLE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY**. \n\n##Post Retrospective\n\nDeep breaths. Okay. There we go. So you shouldn't take my post at complete face value. No i didn't try to deceive you, but I did cut corners in places where actual historians (or people being paid) wouldn't. So here are these aforementioned places. \n\n* Believing the Democratic Party was Unified: I treat the Democrat party as one force, and this isn't 100% accurate. Parties were a bit more wishey washy back then, and there were a lot of internal politics. Especially with the north/south split democrats. I think it is very safe to assume that the large majority of Democrats either tried their best to support slavery, or were indifferent. But still, my numbers for Congress Majority may be a bit misleading\n\n* Ignoring Nuance: This can of beans becomes very apparent when you dive into the Presidents, so I can only assume that all the senators and representatives are nearly like that too. Shits confusing, history doubly so. Maybe Democrat Johnny only supported these slavery things because of ___, and later did ____. I don't have enough time to go through the entire congress for 2 decades. sorry!\n\n* Ignoring primary sources: I didn't go fact checking on how southerners felt at the time. I am willing to bet they had a persecution complex, but who knows. This post was very 'STEM' orientated, with them numbers and percents. A good historical breakdown uses both. \n\n\n##Sources\n\n**Apostles of Disunion**: Fucking read this book already. Jesus. Its not too long. Its shows what happened at state succession conferences. Spoiler alert, they talk about slavery a lot.\n\n**Wikipedia**: [Here is the list for congress control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses), God bless wiki lists amiright?\n\nAn entire year studying Civil War and Civil War Myth and Memory. Reading a lot of other books that are tangential to this, but not directly applicable. \n ",

[Except for the fact that it's bullshit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae) A quick view at the \"Strength\" section of the page gives a MINIMUM estimate of 5200. Okay, they might have been referring to this:  \n\n&gt;Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, and perhaps a few hundred others, most of whom were killed.\n\nEven so, it's not just 300 Spartans who supposedly \"humiliated\" Xerxes, there were at least 1100 others assisting them.   \n\nLater on in the article:\n&gt;One story makes it clear that Xerxes's real enemy wasn't the Greeks, but his own raging, delusional ego. As he crossed the Hellespont, a waterway separating Europe and Asia now known as the Dardanelles, the waters surged up and destroyed the bridges his engineers had spent days building. In response, Xerxes thought it would be appropriate to throw chains into the river, and ordered it be given 300 lashes and branded with hot irons. As his men delivered his punishment, they were ordered to harangue the river. \"You salt and bitter stream, your master lays this punishment upon you for injuring him, who never injured you.\" \n\nNotice, how it's subtly mentioned that it could all just be a story. Cracked.com, however, attempts to pass it as proven, historical fact. Let's just view the [related wikipedia page,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes%27_Pontoon_Bridges) shall we?\n\n&gt;The bridges were described by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories, but little other evidence confirms Herodotus' story in this respect. Most modern historians accept the building of the bridges as such, but practically all details related by Herodotus are subject to doubt and discussion.\n\n#\n&gt;He is then **said** to have thrown fetters into the strait, given it three hundred whiplashes and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.\n\nEmphasis mine.   \n\nOkay, so real talk: It could be true, maybe Xerxes was as egotistical as the cracked article has portrayed him to be. Then again, the accounts of Herodotus have been subject to much skepticism. If you're writing an article about what could be a mere story, it would be a good idea to also explicitly mention that. Omitting important stuff is tantamount to bad history.",

        "text": "Today’s bad history concerns this online list from the website Ranker, specifically that one individual on this list of historic transgender people probably shouldn’t be on there.\n\nhttp://www.ranker.com/list/transgender-people-in-history/devon-ashby?format=SLIDESHOW&amp;page=1\n\nFirstly, I must applaud whenever obscure historical figures are brought into the media spotlight. However there is the issue of diagnosing the biological phenomena of gender dysphoria (which science has only really begun to understand over the past few decades) upon historical figures, to which its credit the article itself notes. Regardless much of the information presented on the people detailed is pretty accurate, and most would’ve probably identified as transgender (if only though because most of them were 20th century Westerns).\n\nNow we get to the issue presented with the listing of Elagabalus, 25th emperor of Rome, as a trans person. The ancient sources that we have to this are all likely to have been biased; however they have made a lasting impact, including being cited for centuries after, including in Gibbon’s famous 18th century volumes. Elagabalus has a pop cultural reputation of being a sexual deviant, not unlike the public perception of Caligula, as can be seen in the 1911 French film, A Roman Orgy:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4FctTSDdpM\n\nRanker states that:\n\n&gt; [He] offered great sums of money to any doctors that could give him a vagina.\n\nThe ancient sources we have to Elagabalus’s life that we cite this information from are troubling from an academic standpoint. \n\nOne of the primary sources we have for is the Historia Augusta, a series of biographies on the emperors, caesars, and usurpers of Rome from 117 to 284. The Historia Augusta, henceforth written as HA, presents itself as being written by six authors during the rules of Diocletian and Constantine I. Today the modern academic consensus is that there was in fact a single author in the late 4th or early 5th centuries, and that HA wasn’t intended to be a serious piece of history. This can be evidenced with the numerous problems it has up next to contemporary histories, including entire biographies of non-existent usurpers, contradictory information, blatantly false statements, and citations and quotations of fabricated or non-existent sources.\n\nAn example of an inaccuracy in the HA in regards to Elagabalus’s effeminacy is the claim that he practiced depilation:\n\n&gt; “He would likewise model the expression of his face on that with which Venus is usually painted, and he had his whole body depilated, deeming it the chief enjoyment of his life to appear fit and worthy to arouse the lusts of the greatest number.”\n\nThis is directly contradicted by contemporary portraits of him having clear facial hair.\n\nSo what is the intent of the HA? Some believe that it’s a satire; others maintain that it’s a pagan propaganda piece against Christianity. The latter theory is evidenced by the fact that Decius and Valerian, persecutors of the church, get off quite lightly. In addition some passages are obvious parodies of Christian scripture such elements of the nativity of Jesus being placed in the life of Severus Alexander:\n\n&gt; “It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea”*\n\n* Just wait until /r/atheism finds out about this.\n\nThe passages in HA on Elagabalus, with his caricatured monotheistic religion, can thus be seen as criticism of the then topical issue of Christianity’s role in Roman government. \n\nBirley (2006) approximates that from HA’s biography of Elagabalus, only 24% of the information presented is accurate. Most of the scholarly agreement is that the majority of the factual content is on the emperor’s assassination rather than his private life.\n\nFrom the views of other primary sources for which much of the popular conception on Elagabalus has been built we see biases as well. The biases of Cassius Dio (to whom we credit the tale of Elagabalus’s desire for a vagina) can be observed in his referral to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, an Assyrian king as equally debauched in myth. Dio’s high position in the government of Elagabalus’s successor, Severus Alexander, also creates doubt to his the accuracy of his claims.\n\nSo like many exaggerated portrayals of people there’s a kernel of truth, by Roman standards Elagabalus was unique, though his perhaps not because of what we would today consider gender dysphoria. Emperor Elagabalus brought the cult of the Syrian sun deity of the same name to Rome and was the cult’s hereditary high priest at Emesa (now Homs), before he was throned. It would be inaccurate to claim that all of Elagabalus’s alleged eccentrics were motivated by theology, but it’s undeniable that this was in part reason for his unpopularity among the Roman elites and certainly a factor in why his reputation would want to be discredited.\n\nWhile religion was a large factor in his unpopularity, it is most improper to overstate the role Elagabalus’s geographical origins hold the contemporary disdain towards him, recall that Rome had regular influence from Syrian culture for around three centuries at this point. However this hasn’t stopped Elagabalus from being a target in the ‘west vs. east’ culture wars of later centuries, being ill fondly referenced to by Gibbon and others as yet another stereotypical oriental out to cause the fall of Rome. He has been played up as the Sardanapalus stereotype of the debauched and feminine Syrian out of touch with Rome, by both the critics of the day and those that followed him long after, thus any speculation and sources on his gender identity should be approached with caution.\n\nThough as to a heterodox sex life, once again there’s a bit of truth. Despite what the films of Fellini could have you believe, even Rome had its sexual taboos and we know for certain that Elagabalus broke a big one in marrying Aquilia Severa. She was a priestess for the goddess Vesta and had thus taken a vow of celibacy for three decades, a vow of which if broken would result in death by live burial. Elagabalus’s marriage to a Vestal Virgin only served to make him more controversial and no doubt fueled flames on the private life of he whom was already an unorthodox emperor. \n\nTl;dr: Roman sources on the private life of Elagabalus contain lots of information unlikely to be true. He could’ve been feminine to an extent, but not to the point as described in the histories. The anecdote that he desired to have a vagina is probably a satirical story or propaganda piece to lampoon and/or discredit an emperor who was disliked due to his religion and sex life (including a taboo marriage).\n\nSources:\n\t\nBirley, Anthony (2006).

        "text": "The YouTube-channel ‘History Buffs’ reviews historical movies with a special emphasis on their historic accuracy. This can be fun and the channel has around 140.000 subscribers. Recently it picked “Agora” for a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwUwjkEveBE) and I was immediately thrilled. For some aspects of this review I will rely on /u/TimONeill and his [blog post](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.de/2010/05/hypatia-and-agora-redux.html) about \"Agora\" and our own badhistory-wiki (np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/good_history). I hope you will indulge this. However, let this be clear. This is a badhistory of History Buff’s video, not of Agora itself. Let’s go.\n\n00:20 \"Set during the last days of the Roman Empire\". The movie is set in 391 AD. The Western Roman Empire wouldn’t fall for another 85 years and the Eastern one not for another 1062 years. But who cares about details?\n\n01:21 “Alexandria was founded by knowledge” Being close to the river delta of the Nile, one of the most important rivers of the Mediterranean Sea certainly didn’t hurt. To the maker’s credit, he later mentions this himself at 02:30. The statement is misleading nonetheless.\n\n01:40 “Alexander’s open-minded approach to their [the Egyptians’] religion and custom”. They hailed him as a half-god and he didn’t stay long. Of course he liked them.\n\n03:30 “His empire would be divided.” He makes it sound as though the fracture of Alexander’s short lived empire was some sort of amicable power-sharing and not decades of war.\n\n3:44 “Science”. Science didn’t exist back then. Call it “proto-science” or “natural philosophy”, but not “Science!”.\n\n04:05 The claim that everybody who entered the city was searched for books. If they had pulled that off, nobody would be willing to take his books to Alexandria because nobody would want to wait for weeks while some scribe went through the labor of copying every word of his book by hand. I am aware that some ancient sources claim they did, but blindly following sources is not proper study. The story is just too impracticable to be taken without salt. And it’s unnecessary to bring it up here! This plays no role in the movie.\n\n04:20 “These books were eventually the only ones to survive the years [because they were constantly copied in the Library of Alexandria].” Yes, sure. Nobody else copied books. Everyone else was stupid. Athens? Stupid. Rome? Stupid. Constantinople? Stupid.\n\n04:50 Come to see a movie review. Stay to listen to an infatuated teenager indulging in his Library of Alexandria fetish. Because there were no other centers of learning.\n\n05:50 Here he blames much of the destruction of the LoA on Caesar’s conquest. This is a possible theory, but by no means the only one. Here it’s given as an unshakeable fact. \n\n06:28 “The Serapeum was all that was left of the original library”. Here I will refer to Tim O’Neil’s review. His position is that not a single ancient source, even pagan ones who didn’t like Christianity, linked the destruction of the Serapeum to the loss of a library. There once was a library in the Serapeum, but not by the time of the movie. History Buffs seems curiously ignorant of this possibility, considering how this movie is all about keeping an open, questioning mind.\n\n08:20 I know I promised not to talk about the actual movie. But this scene was chosen by History Buffs to highlight Hypatia’s intellect. The problem is that the answers her students give are not along the lines of Aristotelian natural philosophy. People had asked why objects fall before and “because it’s heavy” would not have sufficed. It would be more like “the cloth is earthly and that element tends to the center of the universe”. And one of the assembled adults would have given that answer.\n\n08:55 Why did the movie give this Christian orator a horrible accent and bad teeth and the pagan one a posh accent and clean robes? Did anyone who made this movie ever stop to think about why people decided to become Christian? And why does History Buffs fail to point out this blatant black &amp; white painting? \n\n10:02 NO critical distance by History Buffs. They take this movie at its word. By the way, until some point I was still hoping that the speaker would suddenly burst out and say it was all a prank and that this movie was biased as hell. He didn’t.\n\n10:50 So Neoplatonist were atheists then? Or what exactly are we to believe their religious motives were? The following explanation does not really answer this.\n\n12:22 History Buffs fails to note that not a single Roman soldier wears the ridge helmet that was typical for the late Roman army. \n\n14:00 “But the true loss came when Christians descended on the library – and tore it apart [dramatic music]”. Again, we have no firm evidence to suggest that there was a library of significance in the Serapeum. He tries to hedge by saying this library was smaller, but then backtracks and claims that its loss “cannot be understated”. Again, obvious LoA fetish.\n\n14:40 “The last bastion of the ancient wisdom [The Serapeum , meaning the LoA] was gone”. Because there was not a single library elsewhere. Anywhere.\n\n14:45 “All other pagans had either converted or fled Alexandria”. Actually, this makes sense. According to Wiki “Pagus” means country dweller, so pagans literally didn’t live in the city of Alexandria, but in the countryside. Ok, enough wordplay, let’s move on.\n\n14:50 “The Empire had divided and the once mighty city of Rome had been sacked by barbarians only five years before”. The Empire had been divided for quite some time already. Theodosius briefly reunified it, but its recent re-division would not have shocked anyone. Also, given that Alexandria was in the Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths were hardly the ‘worst sackers ever’, I don’t think a strong, independent woman like Hypatia would get depressions over it.\n\n15:20 “I have been unable to find any evidence for this.” Now you start caring about evidence?\n\n18:35 “He declared Hypatia to be a witch” I don’t care whether the movie has a nice scene about it. Declaring somebody a witch 1000 years before the actual witch craze only panders to the common “Christians hate women and declare them witches” stereotype. There were isolated incidents before the witch craze, granted, but I have never, ever, heard of Hypatia being accused of being a witch. Again, not a single critical thought by History Buffs. He just retells the movie.\n\n19:15 It is true that Hypatia had a very painful death, but “in the olden days” a lot of politically motivated killings were slow and painful. Sadly, hers was hardly special.\n\n19:35 “Later he [Cyril, the bad guy] was declared a saint”. Maybe because in real-life he wasn’t the walking one-dimensional stereotype he is in this movie? \n\n19:37 “If science ever had a martyr, it was Hypatia.” She was not a scientist. She was a natural philosopher. And she wasn’t a martyr for natural philosophy either, she just was collateral damage in a power struggle in Alexandria between two Christian factions. On the other hand: At least he didn’t mention Bruno or Galileo, so that’s cool.\n\n20:30 “You [a Christian] do not question what you believe. You cannot. I must.” I find it ironic that History Buffs has this obvious infatuation for Hypatia, incorporates this scene into the review, showing the importance of critical thinking, and never ever questions whether the “Greeks = intelligent and good, Christians = bad and stupid” narrative might be ever so slightly wrong and that Christians could contribute to philosophy.\n\n21:10 Here he admits that there is hardly any surviving information about the actual events and that’s why he doesn’t want to point out inaccuracies in this movie. I mused why he was so ready and willing to give an obviously biased movie (all Christians seem to wear black rags and are hairy) the benefit of the doubt. I was interrupted when he immediately blamed that loss of information on the Christians (“It’s because of stupid shit like this”), instead of a host of problems stifling the leisure to write chronicles, together with the centuries of time that seeped away the sources that were actually written, due to natural spoilage.\n\n20:22 “We know Hypatia was probably in her fifties or sixties at the time of her death… But it’s not that big of a deal to me”. ~~~Having a thirty-something-year-old crack elliptical orbits 1000+ years before Kepler later in the movie is not a big deal??? That’s about as believable as Denise Richards as nuclear physicist Christmas Jones in “James Bond: The World Is Not Enough”. The casting obviously tries to appeal to baser human perception and judging by History Buffs, it seems to work.~~~ Edit: This was never brought up, but I looked it up anyway: Kepler came up with elliptical orbits in his thirties, so Hypatia, being another human, certainly had the same potential (ignoring all the giants on whose shoulders Kepler stood). I still maintain that Hypatia is way too young and elliptical orbits require a suspension of disbelief, but I agree that her age is reconcilable with artistic liscence, as protagonists are played by good-looking people in almost all movies ever made.\n\n24:20 “When Agora came out, let’s just say it wasn’t that well received by Christians.” I wonder why. He eventually goes on that this movie isn’t about Christianity but about general religious fanaticism. Fair enough. Why did they have to bend the evidence then, to shoehorn in their obvious message? He then likens the destruction of the fictional library by fantasy Christians to ISIS. \n\n25:25 The previous bit was annoying, but it was only the build-up. “And so classical Greek and Roman literature were rejected by choice.” No. In the Latin West Greek eventually became extinct. They had no choice about Greek works, they just couldn’t read them. It might come as a surprise to History Buffs, but one of the last ditch efforts to translate Greek works into Latin in Odoacer’s Italy was done by a Christian named Boethius. He devoted his precious time (among other works) on Aristotle’s work on logic. Because he obviously hated Greek classical learning and rational thought \\i. Oh, and Boethius is revered as a Catholic saint.\n\n25:36 Here comes a quote from Tertullian. And a pronunciation straight out of /r/atheism. History buffs calls him a “Christian apologist”. Sounds strange? Where did this specific word come from, it seems so out of context? On to the Wikipedia! And yes, Tertullian is listed as a “Christian apologist”. Curious. He was an important Christian figure, but died about 100 years before Hypatia was even born. Clearly there have been no changes in Christian doctrine for 100 years, nevermind Constantine or the Council of Nicaea. I have already produced Boethius as a counter-example, I will not bother with a second one. AND Tertullian is not a saint. My example of a Christian scholar is literally holier than History Buffs’.\n\n26:20 “And after the Fall of the Roman Empire the Church would be the sole institution in the western world” Except for the Byzantine/\"Roman\" Emperor and the Frankish, Visigoth, Anglo-Saxon and Lombard kingdoms.\n\n26:30 “This period in time [The next 800 years] would be called ‘The Dark Ages.’” Oh. My. God. THANK YOU! It has been so long since I met somebody who seriously called everything until the 13th century “The Dark Ages”. Never mind Charlemagne. Never mind the Renaissance of the High Middle Ages. They were all unwashed savages! \n\n26:36 “Step backwards in human development”. Presentism.\n\nBut it gets better :-)\n\n26:40 “With so much lost it’s impossible to say. Many historians speculate our civilization would be far more advanced than it is today”. We have a [chartist](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/inside_jokes#wiki_what_is_.27the_chart.27.3F)!  Who would have guessed they were still alive and well? Granted, he never outright shows it, but nonetheless: All hail The Chart of Scientific Advancement!!! Because nobody in China is able to do, what Greek Scientists can do! (deliberate capital letter on “scientists” by the way ) \n\nAnd it gets better still!\n\n26:50 He speculates that if “The Dark Ages” hadn’t happened the Greek civ would have unlocked steam engines much sooner than it did. I would go even further. They would also have had access to much better tech and units than the other players and would easily have won the space race victory. \n\n27:15 “What if science wasn’t seen as heresy”. The good old Conflict Theory, backed up by fiction, lies and ignorance. \n\n27:20 Watch this scene. If The Chart was a movie, this would be it.\n\nTL;DR: This is not a critical review. It’s just LoA fetish topped off by The Chart.\n\nEdits: The one about Hypatia's age. Edited a link to The Chart.",

        "text": "So today, I will be doing a small critique of the video [Top 10 Cults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNOSm9wvf5o) by watchmojo\\.com. It's a clickbaity, listicle-type video that tends to ignore nuance for the sake of views, so my post probably sounds like I'm being too harsh given the type of video it is. Admittedly, I am probably being a tad nitpicky, but since this video claims to be factual, I think it's fair game for this subreddit.\n\nI'm not going to discuss the other groups in the video, as I don't consider myself an expert on said groups. That being said, there was a description of the Branch Davidians that I thought was woefully simplistic. \n\nStarting at 5:29, here's the video's short description of Peoples Temple:\n\n&gt; Number 1: the Peoples Temple.\n\n&gt; Jim Jones's Peoples Temple started as a multicultural communist group out to help the poor. The organization eventually tightened its grip on disciples as it preached the coming nuclear apocalypse. Members followed Reverend Jones to Guyana, but when US authorities came knocking in 1978, members of the Peoples Temple shot first and asked questions later. The next day, 918 drank the Kool Aid, only it was laced with cyanide. \n\n&gt; [quote from Q042] \"If we can't live in peace, we'll die in peace.\"\n\nOkay then. Let's start breaking this down.\n\n&gt; Jim Jones's Peoples Temple started as a multicultural communist group out to help the poor.\n\nActually, it started out as an integrated Christian church in Indianapolis. \n\nJones has said that even then, he considered himself to be a communist, but the overtness of the whole communist thing really happened in the 1970s, after the group moved to California.\n\n(As a side note, I noticed that people often leave out the fact that Peoples Temple was a member congregation of the Disciples of Christ. To be fair, that probably doesn't jive with the whole \"cult\" stereotype.)\n\n&gt; The organization eventually tightened its grip on disciples as it preached the coming nuclear apocalypse. Members followed Reverend Jones to Guyana [...]\n\nThat's not the reason why the group relocated to Guyana, as the above statement seems to imply. \n\nPeoples Temple had been making preparations since 1973, when the board of directors [officially resolved to create an agricultural mission in Guyana](http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AgriculturalMission.pdf). However, the mass migration happened in 1977, in the wake of an upcoming negative expose in *New West* (and, as argued by John V. Hall in both *Gone from the Promised Land* and *Apocalypse Observed*, fears related to a government investigation by the Treasury Department, which leaders might have believed would lead to the group's assets being frozen). \n\n&gt; but when US authorities came knocking in 1978, members of the Peoples Temple shot first and asked questions later. The next day, 918 drank the Kool Aid, only it was laced with cyanide.\n\nFirst off, it was Flavor Aid.\n\nSecondly, \"US authorities\" sort of implies police or whatnot. In reality, the people knocking on the door were Congressman Leo Ryan (who had anti-cult sympathies and who claimed to be on a fact-finding mission) and his staff, a group of newsmen (who were hoping to have a big story about the group), and members of the apostate group Concerned Relatives (some who were hoping to kidnap their family members, or at least convince them to leave the group). That's not *exactly* the Justice Department. \n\nThirdly, both the murders of Ryan and four others and the mass deaths in Jonestown happened on the same day, 18 November 1978. Since the video uses clips from *Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple*, this error is somewhat more glaring in its wrongness, ESPECIALLY since the documentary itself is very clear about the whole timeline thing.\n\nFinally, 909 people drank the cyanide and tranquilizer laced drink. 918 is the total number of people who died on 18 November: 5 dead in Port Kaituma, 4 dead in Georgetown, and 909 dead in Jonestown. \n\n(I probably shouldn't complain too much about the number thing, since I'm pretty sure I screwed up in a similar way when I did an AH podcast on Peoples Temple. That being said, my mistakes are equally as fair game as this one, and I'm presuming this actually had a script (since, you know, listicle), versus my being interviewed by 400 members of the order *Lagomorpha* in real time.)\n\nSources:\n\nI'll just be lazy and cite the documentary *Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple*, as that's pretty good for a Peoples Temple 101. Obviously I've got more sources in my head, but all the above is easily covered in the documentary. Plus, I think it would be somewhat overkill to cite all of the academic literature I've read for something like this. ",

        "text": "A wee bit of background is necessary today, my friends. A while back I wrote an essay lambasting some badhistory from a Catholic stan, and while my historical analysis was quite solid, my friends here noted it was rather unseemly of me to treat a random Redditor so harshly. /u/tachibana_taro in particular encouraged me to \"pick on someone my own size,\" so to speak, and I thought that was a good idea! So for today's essay, I'll be taking on an actual published college professor: Edward Feser, who teaches philosophy in California.\n\nHis book, The Last Superstition is probably one of the stronger Christian responses to “New Atheist” books such as The God Delusion.[1] However, Feser aimed to do a little more than just prove the existence of God. He also wanted to prove the validity—indeed, the necessity—of a certain philosophical position: Aristotelian teleological moral realism, from which his particular religious philosophy (that of Thomas Aquinas, or Thomism) is descended. For Feser, Aristotle’s philosophy is more than merely the correct way to make sense of the world, but the very foundation upon which Western Civilization rests: “Abandoning Aristotelianism, as the founders of modern philosophy did, was the single greatest mistake ever made in the entire history of Western thought. More than any other intellectual factor—there are other, non-intellectual factors too, of course, and some are more important—this abandonment has contributed to the civilizational crisis through which the West has been living for several centuries, and which has accelerated massively in the last century or so.”[2]\n\nThis is certainly a bold claim, and Feser admits as much.[3] To his credit, he makes an equally bold attempt to back it up, spending most of the book first explaining Plato and Aristotle’s philosophies. He then doing the same for Aquinas, and subsequently explains how other philosophers (Hume, Descartes, and Kant, among others, and moving on to contemporary philosophers such as Paul and Patricia Churchland), in his view, failed to refute the Greeks and Medievals. At last, he proceeds to explain how this failure also foiled the attempts of the present-day “New Atheists” to disprove God and “traditional” morality.\n\nFeser’s efforts are muchly appreciated (by me, at least); his arguments and analyses are not only (reasonably) well-sourced but wonderfully lucid as well. I am a layman with little background in philosophy, and before you condemn me too harshly, Feser marketed this book for laymen, not only scholarly philosophers. From a layman’s perspective, then, he did a wonderful job: I found his explanations of Aristotle and Plato’s thought to be easily understandable, and given how obtuse and hard-to-follow philosophical writing tends to be, that Feser made it comprehensible speaks very well of his skill. He also manages to make the read quite jaunty and entertaining. While several commenters, both Christian allies and atheist enemies, have criticized the somewhat insulting and polemical tone of *The Last Superstition,* I actually found it somewhat appealing. First, I can be and have been far nastier than Feser at his very worst, so it would be hypocritical of me to condemn him (as my friends at /r/badhistory have told me, it’s something I should work on), but more importantly, a little bit of rivalry and therefore harsh words between “intellectual enemies” can make an otherwise dry and technical philosophical monograph into amusing reading. While inappropriate in a scholarly context, of course, in a book aimed at laymen, a few insults and pointed jokes here and there can keep the lay audience engaged as if they were watching a jousting match or sports spectacle rather than an academic lecture. Of course, the book isn’t all jabs and insults, Feser at least has a sense of humor and pokes a few jokes at his own expense as well, which are both funny and prove he doesn’t take himself more seriously than he warrants. Combined with the clear and cogent distillation of complex philosophical topics, this book at least has convinced me that Feser would be an excellent teacher. Were I to take one of his classes at Pasadena, I’m confident I would learn a lot and have a lot of fun doing it.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the many strengths of Feser’s work, it is not at all without flaws. I’m not a professional philosopher, but I do know a little bit about history, and that was enough for me to detect more a few troubling errors in Feser’s historical analyses (as opposed to his philosophical ones—though I’ll also admit he didn’t quite succeed in convincing this layman of Aristotle’s infallibility. In his attempt to prove that our abandonment of Aristotelianism was a “mistake,” Feser seems to paper over some of the less savory aspects of Aristotle’s writings. He also seems to gloss over the ways Aristotelianism can and historically has been used to support positions abhorrent to a traditional Catholic perspective. Shedding some light on these skeletons in Aristotle’s closet will be the purpose—the Final Cause, if you will (tee-hee)—of today’s essay. Since this is /r/badhistory, I shall concentrate entirely upon the historical arguments Feser makes—reviewing his book as a whole would be more suited to /r/philosophy (I don’t think it merits /r/badphilosophy). For those of you who might be interested, you can see my whole review, and this essay is a part of it, [over here](https://gunlord500.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/a-little-late-but-not-too-late-my-book-review-of-edward-fesers-the-last-superstition/). But that’s enough of an introduction and thesis statement. Let’s begin the analysis!\n\nThe first sin of historical obfuscation for which I will take Feser to task occurs on page 147 and its endnote on page 283. He claims that “we live in society with others—man being a social animal as well as a rational one, as Aristotle noted…Hence the existence of natural law entails…many other rights (such as a right to personal liberty that is strong enough to rule out chattel slavery as intrinsically immoral – the claim made by some that natural law theory would support slavery as it was known in the United States is a slander).”[1] He goes into more depth in the endnote, saying\n\n&gt;“That one human being can literally own another as his property, or can kidnap another and make him a slave, or that some races are naturally suited to being enslaved by others, are notions condemned by natural law theory as intrinsically immoral. It is true that natural law theory has traditionally allowed that lesser forms of “slavery” could in principle be justified. But what this would involve is a prolonged period of servitude as a way of paying off a significant debt, say, or as punishment for a crime…Even so, natural law theorists have tended to see the practice as too fraught with moral hazards to be defensible in practice; and the suggestion that the legitimacy of racial chattel slavery as it was known in early American history follows from natural law theory is, as I say, a slander.”[2]\n\nAs an aside, Feser makes almost this exact same point, with minor changes on his blog:\n\nhttp://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/01/walters-on-tls.html\n\n&gt;“One must be careful in accusing classical natural law theory of entailing the justifiability of slavery. In fact the sorts of things most people think of when they hear the word “slavery” – chattel slavery, racial slavery, kidnapping, breaking up families, the African slave trade, etc. – are not justifiable on classical natural law theory. Indeed, classical natural law theory condemns these things as immoral even in principle. What it does allow as justifiable in principle is the much less harsh form of servitude involving a prolonged obligation to labor for another as payment of a debt, punishment for a crime, and so forth. And even this has rightly been regarded by modern natural law theorists as too fraught with moral hazard to be justifiable in practice. The common charge that natural law theory would support slavery as it was known in the American context is therefore simply a slander.”\n\n(I bring this up to note that I have made a good-faith effort to see if Feser improved or extended his argument in The Last Superstition anywhere else. As far as I have been able to discern, he has not and this is the strongest argument he has available).\n\nAlas, in both *The Last Superstition* and his blog, Feser is wrong. Terribly wrong. Indeed, I would argue that claiming anyone who sees a connection between natural law and American racial slavery commits slander *is itself* a slander. As we will see, going back in history to Aristotle himself, and then looking at his biggest fans in the U.S, there is ample evidence in the historical record to support such a connection, and honest, reasonable people can very, very easily assert it exists.\n\nDr. Feser seems to imply that Aristotle was the founder, or at least a very significant part, of the natural law tradition—as he states, “the moral views now associated in the secularist mind with superstition and ignorance [i.e the moral views Feser is defending from such calumnies] in fact follow inexorably from a consistent application of the metaphysical ideas we’ve traced back through Aquinas and the other Scholastic thinkers to Plato and Aristotle…in particular, this classical metaphysical picture entails a conception of morality traditionally known as *natural law theory.*”[3]\n\nGiven Aristotle’s importance to the natural law tradition, if it is true that slavery would be “condemned by natural law theory as intrinsically immoral,” one would expect Aristotle to have condemned it. But this is not the case-precisely the opposite. The great historian of slavery, David Brion Davis, in his equally great, comprehensive study of slavery in the Western world, does not allow Aristotle to escape his probing analytical eye:\n\n&gt;“The natural slave, according to Aristotle, could have no will or interests of his own; he or she was merely a tool or instrument, the extension of the owner’s physical nature. In an important passage that deserves to be quoted in full, Aristotle makes explicit the parallel between the slave and the domesticated beast: ‘Tame animals are naturally better than wild animals, yet for all tame animals there is an advantage in being under human control, as this secures their survival…by analogy, the same must necessarily apply to mankind as a whole. Therefore all men who differ from one another by as much as the soul differs from the body or man from a wild beast (and that is the state of those who work by using their bodies, and for whom that is the best they can do)—these people are slaves by nature, and it is better for them to be subject to this kind of control, as it is better for the other creatures I’ve mentioned…[A]ssistance regarding the necessities of life is provided by both groups, by slaves and domestic animals. Nature must therefore have intended to make the bodies of free men and slaves different also; slaves’ bodies strong for the services they have to do, those of free men upright and not much use for that kind of work, but instead useful for community life.’\n\nWhile even Aristotle admitted that sometimes ‘slaves can have the bodies of free men’ and that free men could have ‘only the souls and not the bodies of free men,’ he could nevertheless conclude, in an argument that would have immeasurable influence in Western culture, that ‘it is clear that there are certain people who are free and certain who are slaves by nature, and it is both to their advantage, and just, for them to be slaves.’ While slaves in antiquity could usually be recognized by clothing, branding, and collars, and other symbols, the millennia-long search for ways to identify ‘natural slaves’ would eventually be solved by the physical characteristics of sub-Saharan Africans. [My emphasis added.]“[4]\n\nDavis cites Aristotle’s Politics, quoted from Thomas Wiedmann’s Greek and Roman Slavery (1981). The translation seems to be quite accurate, for Aristotle’s Politics can be found here:\n\nhttp://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html\n\nSpecifically, from the end of Part IV to the beginning of Part V. Looking at a little more of this translation, however, we can see things look even worse for Feser’s assertion. Again, Feser claimed classical natural law theory justifies slavery only in “the much less harsh form of servitude involving a prolonged obligation to labor for another as payment of a debt, punishment for a crime,” etc. But this is in direct contradiction to what Aristotle, assumedly a founder of the classical natural law tradition, believed. As the Philosopher states in the linked Politics section (courtesy of MIT), “is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation of nature? There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.” Aristotle explicitly says some people are “marked out for subjection from the hour of their birth.” This seems quite obviously to justify slavery as a lifelong condition, not as temporary punishment for some crime.[5]\n\nI can’t fathom why Feser didn’t mention any of this—he would certainly be aware of Aristotle’s Politics, given his expertise on Aristotle generally, and would therefore be aware of Aristotle’s condoning of slavery. Maybe Feser did not want to weaken his argument by making Aristotle look bad, but then one could accuse Feser of, if not dishonesty, then at least less-than-forthrightness. I don’t think this is the case, however, because a criticism of Aristotle would have led Feser to a defense of Christianity specifically (rather than the “Philosopher’s God” generally), which is what he would have wanted to do as a Catholic. Later on in Inhuman Bondage, Davis praises many Catholics for their opposition to slavery. Gregory of Nyssa (the great Catholic saint and theologian) was the first person in all of antiquity to condemn slavery in and of itself (though some Stoics and Cynics were also, well, cynical about the institution).[6]  Alas, St. Aquinas didn’t go as far—according to Davis, “Aquinas emphasized that the institution [slavery] was contrary only to the first intention of nature, but not to the second intention, which was adjusted to man’s limited capacities in a sinful world. Aquinas still thought of slavery as occasioned by sin, but he made it seem more natural and tolerable by identifying it with the rational structure of being, which required each individual to accept, along with old age and death, the necessity of subordination to a higher authority.”[7] While obviously not as forcefully antislavery as St. Gregory, Aquinas nonetheless identifies he institution as an undesirable necessity in a fallen world rather than a simple result of nature. Since Feser is defending not just Aristotle’s God but Aquinas’ more particular Catholic God, he would have done well to note how Aquinas was actually more advanced in morality than his predecessor.\n\nUnfortunately, this embryonic antislavery impulse would not blossom within Christendom for many centuries. During that time, Aristotle provided very strong ground for proponents of American racial slavery to stand on; a fact to which a veritable panoply of primary sources attest. One could probably write an excellent historical monograph on this subject, but I’d rather not at the moment. First, I don’t have that much time, and second, I don’t want to scoop myself before seeing if I can make a book out of this ;D So forgive me if this is a little haphazard.\n\nI’ll first note that David Brion Davis was not the only one to perceive the relationship between slavery and Aristotle’s philosophy, nor its connection with race. To quote Marek Steedman’s Jim Crow Citizenship: Liberalism and the Southern Defense of Racial Hierarchy, “race was an intrinsic part of the defense of slavery in the antebellum South. Moreover race naturalized slavery not simply by casting slaves as an inferior, but as specifically fitted for a domesticated, childlike dependence…Aristotle cast the division between the true master and true slave, at least on its face, in terms of a capacity for virtue. The true slave, incapable of full rationality, could at best follow directions, and was not capable of the complete practice of virtue Aristotle equated with human happiness and fulfillment…*Were it true, he [Aristotle] suggests, that ‘a good man is born of good men,’ and implicitly, that noxious creatures are born of noxious creatures, then it would be possible to justify the enslavement of the children of slaves.”*[8] (My emphasis added)\n\nWe can therefore see how racial slavery would be perfectly consistent with an Aristotelian conception of natural law. Even if both groups were human (and the popularity of ‘polygenesis’ theories in the antebellum South made this by no means an uncontested proposition), it just so happened that black humans had a different “essence” than white humans: The former were congenitally endowed with less reason and virtue than the latter, who, being noble, begat noble children. This meant that blacks were congenitally fated to serve whites, congenitally fated to rule—in short, a perpetual system of racial slavery. One can see this ‘directly from the horse’s mouth,’ so to speak. Just listen to Professor Thomas Roderick Dew in “The Pro-Slavery Argument” (authored with several other influential Southerners, such as senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina). He told us “Aristotle, the greatest philosopher of antiquity, and a man of as capacious mind as the world ever produced, was a warm advocate of slavery—maintaining that it was reasonable, necessary, and natural; and, accordingly, in his model of a republic, there were to be comparatively few freemen served by many slaves.”[9] Listen as well to The Southern Literary Messenger, a proslavery periodical widely read among educated men in the South, which posted many articles proving slavery was natural in the Aristotelian sense. In a passage that sounds eerily similar to something Feser might have written, an anonymous author declared “to Aristotle, one of the most profound of the philosophers of antiquity, we confidently appeal, and with more confidence, because in this iron age of utilitarianism, his material philosophy, fortified with all the powers of the ‘greatest, wisest, meanest of mankind,’ has been preferred to the spiritual sublimity of the divine Plato. Aristotle has expressly declared, that ‘in the natural state of man, from the origin of things, a portion of the human family must command, and the remainder obey; that the distinction which exists between master and servant is a distinction at once natural and indispensable; and that when we find existing among men freemen and slaves, it is not man, but nature herself, who has ordained the distinction.”[10]\n\nTo be fair, Aristotle did not say exactly the same things Dew and The Southern Literary Messenger did.. As S. Sara Monoson has pointed out, “Aristotle dismisses body type as a reliable indicator of free or slave by nature even though natural slaves will be especially suited to hard physical labour. As a matter of fact, he acknowledges, ‘Slaves often have the bodies of freemen.’ Moreover, it does not even occur to him to consider skin colour as a useful sign. He does not trust physical markers much at all.” She goes on to note that many Southerners were going off mistranslations of Aristotle’s writing or reading their own biases into him.[11] Unfortunately, the old philosopher cannot be let off the hook so easily. Some Southerners did engage Aristotle directly on his own points—Monoson gives George Frederick Holmes as an example. It seems that Holmes explicitly admitted Aristotle did not claim blacks were naturally suited to slavery—but then claimed this was merely because Aristotle did not have as much experience with blacks as 19th century Southerners did, and if he had, he would approve of racial chattel slavery! Holmes told his readers that “the distinct functions of different races in the onward march of human progress promises to be recognized as the principle axiom of historical science” and of course, predictably, the ‘function’ of the black race (in the Aristotelian sense Feser tries to defend in The Last Superstition) would be to serve.[12]\n\nEven then, I suppose, Aristotle needs some defense. You could say that Holmes still failed to appreciate many of the nuances in Aristotle’s position; Monson argues that he certainly did. She points out that “Aristotle himself never marshals the ubiquity of slavery through history and cross-culturally as evidence of its roots in nature and justice. Instead, Aristotle insists on the logical separation of these issues.”[13] Since Holmes claimed the widespread usage of Africans as slaves meant that Africans were “naturally” slaves, Aristotle would likely disagree and tell Holmes that neither physical appearance nor common usage were sufficient to mark an institution like slavery as “natural” in the “natural law” sense.\n\nBut alas, once again, we can’t let Aristotle off too easily. Monoson tells us that Aristotle believed “a different observable form of activity—endurance of despotism without resentment—as a good sign that faulty deliberative capacities, and thus slavish natures, are widespread in a population.”[14] Surprise surprise, slaveowners “found” this trait amongst blacks. Proslavery literature abounded with descriptions of how happy blacks were to be enslaved. It was all BS, of course—many Southerners took slave songs as proof slaves were “happy” when in fact the songs were about how much working for Massa sucked; many slaveowners also whipped their slaves if the unfortunates acted too miserable (a literal case of “the beatings will continue until morale improves”). But the line of reasoning Southerners used was valid under Aristotle’s reasoning about slavery—it just wasn’t “sound” (it was empirically false).\n\nI have demonstrated, I hope, the two main thrusts of my argument, specifically to refute Feser’s attempt at defending Aristotle. To review: Feser claimed that natural law theory, originated by Aristotle among others, condemned slavery as “intrinsically immoral,” and that it is slanderous to claim American racial chattel slavery could have possibly been legitimized by natural law theory. As the scholars I’ve quoted above prove, however, Aristotle never condemned slavery as a whole on natural-law grounds, instead saying it could be justified under certain conditions. And while American slaveowners weren’t 100% correct in their readings of Aristotle, they still used him enthusiastically to justify their regime. It is, therefore, not in the least a “slander” to say that the natural law tradition, exemplified by Aristotle at least, could be and has been used to justify racial chattel slavery.\n\nYet the errors in Feser’s reading of history go deeper than that. He blames a lot of things on our abandonment of Aristotelianism—most notably abortion and Communism. Once again, to quote him from page 51, “Abandoning Aristotelianism…is implicated in…mass-murder on a scale unparalleled in human history. Its logical implications can also be seen in today’s headlines: in the abortion industry’s slaughter of millions upon millions of unborn human beings.” The mass-murder bit is certainly a reference to Communism, since he mentions it produced “100 million corpses” on page 160.\n\nI’ll admit I don’t know as much about Communism and abortion as I do about American slavery. What little I do know, however, is enough to make me a little suspicious about Big A’s ability to stop either of those two things (and I don’t want to get into a debate on whether they should be stopped, I aim *only* to contest Feser’s premises).\n\nFirst, with reference to abortion, many of his disciples had and have no problem with the practice. Ayn Rand is the most notable example, see these:\n\nhttp://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/abortion.html\n\nhttp://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html\n\nThe first link shows us Ms. Rand was pro-choice, the second that she was pro-Aristotle. Now, Ms. Rand’s devotion to Aristotle was not absolute, she modified his theories significantly. Indeed, Feser would argue her defense of abortion was incorrect on Aristotelian grounds—she claims a fetus is not an actual human being but a potential one, while Feser would claim a fetus is an actual human being that simply hasn’t yet actualized its potentialities.[15] However, she still called herself an Aristotelian, and used Aristotelian reasoning (the bit about actuals and potentials). A bad Aristotelian is not one who has abandoned Aristotle wholly. Thus, if even an Aristotelian like her—and she’s a very famous one—could justify abortion, it is quite unclear that the “abandonment” of Aristotelianism led to widespread acceptance of the practice. Even if Hume hadn’t “infected” Western Civ with all his pernicious ideas (in Feser’s view), the example of Rand might lead us to suspect that Aristotelians would have ended up justifying the practice anyways, even if (again) Feser would claim they were following Aristotle poorly.\n\nThe same applies to Communism. Feser doesn’t mention this alongside his fervid denunciation of Communism and Marxism, but scholars (at least since the 80s, and I’m very certain it’s been noted long before then) have explained how Karl Marx owed a great deal to Aristotle. As an aside, it’s something that’s interested me for quite a while. I’ve always heard Marx had a ‘teleological’ view of history, and the idea that humanity ‘tends’ or ‘ought to be’ focused on a certain mode of development is hardly an anti-Aristotelian idea, even if that “telos” was a stateless society (for Marx) rather than an individual state of virtue/flourishing (for Aristotle). As it so happens, Philip Kain, George E. McCarthy, and Johnathan Pike (among others) can provide me a little bit of backup.\n\nMcCarthy acknowledges, in passages sure to please Feser, that Marx did owe a great deal to the “modern” philosophers Feser criticizes—Hume, Locke, Descartes, and others. However, McCarthy also says of Marx, “from his earliest interests in Greek and Roman history and mythology to the completion of his dissertation on the physics of Epicurus and Democritus, ancient philosophy formed a central focus of his intellectual life…Without an appreciation for Epicurus’ theories of happiness and nature or Aristotle’s theory of universal and particular justice, the purpose of Marx’s later analyses of the classical political economy of Ricardo, Smith, and Malthus would be lost. As unusual as it may sound, Marx’s analysis of Ricardo’s Principles of Political Economy and Taxation makes sense only within the context of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics.”[16]\n\nThat’s the introduction, and the rest of the book goes on to defend that thesis—I don’t have time to summarize the whole thing, though I do recommend it to interested parties. Suffice it to say that McCarthy makes a very convincing case that Marx was greatly indebted to Aristotle, among others. While of course McCarthy also notes the myriad ways in which Marx modified the Philosopher’s thought, or disagreed entirely, no-one who reads this book can really assume that Marx, and therefore his Communist philosophy, “abandoned” Aristotle entirely. In fact, an essay published a few years after McCarthy’s monograph, in a collection he edited, goes even further in identifying Marx with Aristotle, and the natural law tradition specifically. This paragraph deserves to be quoted in full:\n\n“It should be clear that Marx in many ways agrees with the natural law tradition. He holds that there is an independent moral ground from which to judge the validity of or justice of civil laws; laws are not valid simply because they have been properly instituted. He sees this normative criterion of civil law as rational and rooted in nature and, like many natural law theorists, sees a close relationship between descriptive laws of nature and laws as prescriptive social norms. Finally, as does much of this tradition, Marx holds a doctrine of essence—one very much like Aristotle’s.”[17]\n\nAccording to the footnotes at the end of that essay, this is in reference to Marx’s dissertation, along with several other papers of his in the collected Marx-Engels reader.\n\nSimilarly, Jonathan E. Pike has found that Marx’s critique of philosophers such as Bentham, as well as his analysis of economics, owes a great deal to Aristotelian concepts. As Pike informs us, “productive activity though, takes the place of Geist [a concept from Hegel] as the analogue for the Aristotelian soul, and takes the role of a form giving potency inhering in the persisting social matter that is the only transhistorical existent for Marx…he only permits real universals: universals that are actually instantiated, and not merely logical universals within his ontology…His overall approach is, in this sense, Aristotelian.”[18]\n\nPike’s footnotes refer to Marx’s Grundrisse, or outline of political economy.\n\nInteresting stuff, certainly, but it’s even more interesting if you’re reading this (as I am) alongside The Last Superstition itself. These explanations of Marx, especially in regards to potency, change, and the purposes of things, sound eerily similar to many passages in Feser’s book. Once again, as you can tell, it doesn’t bode well for Feser’s thesis (at least in regards to Communism and other ‘modern ills’). It’s pretty easy (especially for conservatives) to cast Marx and his Communist philosophy as an evil villain responsible for the deaths of millions, but it gets a little harder to do when your villain is more similar to you than you might like.[19] As the examples above show, Marx was at least not entirely some sort of anti-Aristotelian; at the very least he was as astute a student of the old Greek as he was of modern philosophers. He certainly did not “abandon” Aristotle wholesale. Now, you could say he was not at all astute but rather a very poor student of Aristotle, and that Aristotle would find Marx’s theories abhorrent. I am not an expert on Marx or Aristotle, so I’ll not come down on that point one way or another. However, Marx was still a student of Aristotle, much like Feser—however much Feser might like to deny it. The syllogism Feser wants to get us to believe—that abandoning Aristotle leads to Marxism which leads to suffering[20]--is therefore not sound, i.e one of its premises is factually incorrect. Marx really didn’t abandon Aristotle, and Aristotelian ideas are an important part of his philosophy. If you want to lay “millions of corpses” at the foot of Communism…well, I won’t say that Aristotle must shoulder a bit of the blame, but I will say that you’ll be very disappointed if you think he could have shielded you from such horrors.\n\nAgain, I’m not blaming Aristotle; certainly not saying that Aristotelianism leads necessarily to abortion or “Communist mass-murder” or whatever (and, once again, this is not to get into a debate over whether abortion is moral or whether or not Communism is good or bad). It would be unfair to make that claim—if Aristotle’s disciples, even those more dim-witted than the relatively thoughtful Feser, were to criticize me for doing so, they would be right (a rare occurrence, at least for the dim-witted ones). Fortunately, however, I am *not* doing that. I am merely pointing out that Feser has very much failed to substantiate the proposition that “abandoning Aristotle” led to the ills he condemns.\n\n[1] Feser, The Last Superstion, 147.\n\n[2] Ibid, 283.\n\n[3] Ibid, 132.\n\n[4] David Brion Davis, Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World (Oxford University Press, 2006), 33-34.\n\n[5] There’s a curious essay which attempts to defend Aristotle on slavery: Peter Simpson, http://www.aristotelophile.com/Books/Articles/AristotleDefensibleDefenseofSlavery.pdf but I don’t have the time to get into it now. It argues Aristotle’s defense of slavery was a valid logical argument in that its conclusions followed from their premises without contradicting themselves (not that the premises were necessarily sound).

Pike, From Aristotle to Marx: Aristotelianism in Marxist Social Ontology (Ashgate Publishing, 1999), 35.\n\n[19] This is not at all an unfair characterization of Feser; at least from The Last Superstition, his understanding of “Marxism” really is that jejune. Looking at his index, “Marxism” is referred to only on pages 16, 20, and 222, Comunism on 153 and 159-60. In order, his engagement with the philosophy consists of comparing Marxism (and secularism too) to religion (16), that “anti-communists” were more often than not the victims of “false charges” (20, the footnote refers to Senator McCarthy), that “post-communist” beliefs in a paradise on earth are at least as dumb as religious beliefs in an afterlife (153), the aforementioned “millions of corpses” line on 159-60, and on 222, that the “refutation” of Aristotelian metaphysics (which he believes to have been no refutation at all) led to the “debasement of man” in the forms of “National Socialism and Marxism” (his words, he apparently conflates the two).\n\n[20] Say this in a Yoda voice.",

        "text": "A question in AH [about Hannibal's race](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4mzcv2/was_hannibal_barca_black/) (people are still resisting the inevitable rise of Jewish Bolshevist cultural Marxism *in 2016?*) alerted me to the new History Channel series about the barbarians who fought Rome, and I was then repeatedly alerted to this very same series every time I went on AH because apparently Reddit has finally learned a little ad targeting goes a long way. Anyway, it has been a while since I have done one of these and this series seems to be getting some buzz, the offbeat interpretation should be fun, and after watching the intro it is pretty clear where all the money shirtless Ragnar brings in has been reinvested in, so I figure it needs to be done. The minute tagged blow by blows I did on previous ones seems a bit clumsy when I look back over them, so I will organize this commercial break segment by commercial break segment, only interjecting if something really wild happens. Without further adieu:\n\n1-14: The way the show works is that the story is advanced by the tried and true “Narration plus talking heads” format that is the backbone of History Channel docs, with specific scripted scenes interspersed for particularly dramatic moments. And you know what? I like it. In a ideal world, of course, every documentary would be produced and narrated by Michael Wood, but barring that this combined approach works really well. So good on you, History Channel.\n\nAs for the history part, eh? The narrative they are pushing is “barbarians against Rome” and despite some lip service about how there is no single barbarian polity they seem to basically pushing this as a binary struggle. Hannibal, and let me be clear that I freaking *love* Hannibal, Hannibal is literally what got me in to Roman history, and yes, Hannibal is definitely the greatest general of the ancient world fight me irl Alexander fanboys, is being portrayed as a sort of barbarian uniter, and actually I am okay with it. It is being very clear that Hannibal is being two faced in his dealings with the other barbarians (quick note: in a Roman context it is absolutely acceptable to call Carthaginians “barbarians”) by claiming to be the great resister while actually pursuing Carthage's interests. He also gives a nice little quip (I have something Rome does not, his name is Comelios) is actually cribbed from a real Hannibal quip (The Roman army is vast, yet not a one among them is named Mago), so that's cool.\n\nQuick note on black Hannibal: I don't give a shit. He probably looked more like a north African but he might have looked like a black man so I really don't care.\n\nAnyway, I will rate the history so far as cheesy and a bit confused but acceptable and I like the format. Plenty of details are wrong (Scipio, for example, did not have the full backing of the Senate in fact he was often feuding with other members, for example, and they get Hannibal's oath to destroy Rome wrong) but that is to be expected. Onward.\n\n14:30: Haha Tulsi Gabbard is one of the talking heads. Technically it is no more ridiculous than Wesley Clark but at least with him there is the excuse that he was a general.\n\n17:40: And now there is a CEO talking about confidence, they clearly pulled out all stops on the talking heads.\n\n22:00: JESSE JACKSON IS A TAKING HEAD this is awesome. Okay I'll stop mentioning these. That being said anther Civil Rights leader (Clarence Jones) is also on and I am wondering if I am missing a bit of meta history about the connection between “the barbarians” and their use by later actual struggles for freedom.\n\n14-28: This is all about the road over the Alps, and unfortunately this is where we get the first serious distortion of history. During the crossing if the Alps, perhaps as destructive as the elements were the people who lived there, and Hannibal fought many battles against them, for example the Allobrages led a very destructive assault on his army during a difficult passage. But the narrative being pushed here is “Rome against the barbarians” and I suppose it would be too difficult to keep that narrative rolling if we admitted that Rome had as many allies as enemies in any given war. Also, I was going to note that none of the very complex internal politics of Rome were being portrayed, but I realized that is *exactly how barbarians tend to be portrayed in these things* so touche History Channel.\n\n29:30: In the lead-up to the battle of Cannae it says something along the lines of Scipio being overconfident: Cornelius Scipio had nothing to do with Cannae. His son, Cornelius Scipio soon-to-be Africanus, was a junior officer who acquitted himself very well, but the leaders of the Roman army were Varro and Aemilius Paulus. I am worried about whether the show will even bother to distinguish father and son there.\n\n28-41: And here it comes off the wheel real bad. Real bad. On a seemingly minor detail, it portrays Cornelius Scipio as stopping a peace delegation to Hannibal after Cannae: There was no delegation. There was absolutely no talk of peace within the Roman government, this is entirely made up. And yes, in my youthful naivety of ten minutes ago I thought the refusal to recognize the internal disputes within Rome as a cleverly subversive move, but given that “Scipio” continues to be the villain against Hannibal it seems to be more driven by laziness.\n\nAlso, the show claims that Zama was the first battle Hannibal lost, and this is incorrect. Hannibal may have been the greatest general of the ancient world, again fight me irl, but he did lose a few, most notably at Nola against Marcellus (who later died fighting Hannibal so whose laughing now). Then it goes on to portray the later Roman assaults on Hispania (specifically Lusitania) as being revenge for the Second Punic War, which is ridiculous. The history is getting pretty bad now. The whole “Rome is literally the empire from Star Wars” thing is pretty great though.\n\n42-49: We now go to the rise of Viriatus, one of the most dangerous enemies Rome faced in the conquest of Spain, which was by far the longest and bloodiest conquest it made. The show portrays this conquest as genocidal, which is something of a stretch, there is no evidence that anyone in Rome intended the extermination of an ethnic group—a genocide is more than just a collection of massacres. It also portrays Viriatus as a humble shepherd type who is thrust into the war, which is ridiculous because he was certainly of the elite class by the time the war against Rome came. Honestly the whole thing is shaping up to be basically a fictional story.\n\n49-end: As expected, the whole Viriatus thing is basically just made up. Viritaus is here portrayed as a sort of Robin Hood crossed with William Wallace, leading small groups of men who velociraptor Roman patrols. In reality, Viritaus was a clever leader who utilized ambush and chevauchee to devastating effect, but at no point was he the brave leader of a band of refugees—he had an army. And the worst of it, the evil Roman general has a *beard*, when everyone knows that the Romans were clean shaven.\n\nSo what to make of the whole thing? It is pretty entertaining, I never didn't enjoy it. History wise, it starts to really go off the rails at the end of the Hannibal segment and pretty much stays off the rails for the entirety of the Viriatus story. There is a pretty big difference between the two: we can make a whole movie, hell a whole miniseries, following the story of Hannibal without adding a single detail to our sources. This is not the case with Viriatus, the sources for which amount to a couple pages in Appian and a few paragraphs across other authors. It will need to wait for later episodes to see whether the fact that Hannibal's story hews closer to history was because it has a much richer source base, or just because it is a difficult story to improve.\n\nIn the introduction, as a side note, it hints at who the later episodes might revolve around. I am really quite curious whether it will show Boudicca crucifying all he shopkeepers in London, or Geiseric (fucking *Geiseric* is one of the heroes) raping a group of nuns.\n\nIs its good history? God no, it didn't even fulfill the low expectations I placed on it. It is pretty entertaining though and the anti-Roman perspective is kind of funny.",

        "text": "Spoiler alert for the maybe three people out there who haven't seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and who have some desire to do so.\n\nI was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer when I came to [this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ycyyEDSoF8&amp;feature=youtu.be) where Giles and Willow are investigating a super spooky axe using a website helpfully titled \"History of the axe as a tool and weapon.\" Willow spots an axe with the name \"mʔ,\" which prompts Giles to helpfully explain:\n\n&gt; Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know. M plus a glottal stop is represented by a picture that's commonly thought to symbolise a sickle or a scythe.\n\nThis is incorrect. I'm by no means an expert on hieroglyphs, but I did look through [and extensive list of hieroglyphs, with a focus on the \"m\" hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_hieroglyphs_by_alphabetization#M) and not only didn't find this particular hieroglyph, but also didn't find one that was a combination of an m and a glottal stop. I found m3' and a couple varieties of that, but none of them are particularly scythe or sickle-shaped. Indeed, the actual symbol for a glottal stop is a [vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_G1.png?4d556), which, to me, is not terribly sickle-shaped, but I suppose it's open to interpretation.\n\nWhat's more damning for our dear friend Mr. Giles is that Egyptian hieroglyphs are decidedly more complicated than he lets on. While he's right that hieroglyphs will generally represent a consonant in a word, what a given hieroglyph represents will change dramatically depending on whether it's written alone or what position it takes in a word. \n\nTo explain further, there are twenty-four hieroglyphs that are unilaterals, or symbols that represent entire consonants in their own right. These are things that in the modern Latin alphabet might be represented as \"t\" or \"d\" or \"m.\" These differ from other hieroglyphs in that not every hieroglyph is necessarily its own sound unless used in combination with something else. For instance, [this hieroglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_Aa1.png?3a810) on its own represents the kh sound (the sound you make when you have something caught in your throat that you want to hack out), but can also be used in the word \"Khepri\" as a way to clarify the pronunciation without necessarily being pronounced itself. As a bit of a tangent, scribes had a habit of sometimes inserting these where they weren't needed, or to clarify the pronunciation of a hieroglyph that could be pronounced in different ways, or to take up space. Words could also have their consonants rearranged for aesthetic purposes, which is just amazing. Back to the point, though, I don't know whether Giles' mysterious sickle hieroglyph is one of these unilateral hieroglyphs (probably not), but if it was, it couldn't necessarily be described as a set of consonants. Rather, it would be something else entirely. \n\nEgyptian hieroglyphs also have bilateral and trilateral symbols, representing more complex sounds, where the mouth makes several different movements. These, once again, are sounds in their own right, not a set of consonants, and are used in combination with other hieroglyphs to spell out words.\n\nTo further complicate this, still other hieroglyphs can represent entire words by themselves, if marked with a vertical line. [This happy little hieroglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_G38.png?e0ffb), for instance, can represent either the sound \"s3\" or \"sa,\" or, if marked with a vertical line, the word \"duck.\" What meaning it has depends entirely on how it's written, and in what context. \n\nTo be entirely fair, Giles isn't completely wrong. Hieroglyphs could represent a set of consonants. The trouble is that he's grossly oversimplifying the Egyptian writing system to an impressionable student. \"mʔ\" could have any number of meanings, and hieroglyphs have a ton of variety, but it's safe to say that this one isn't actually \"big stabby scary thing.\"\n\nSources!\n\n\"How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs\" by Mark Collier, a very handy book, which I recommend if you, like me, have too much confidence in your linguistic ability and just want to be knocked around by a frankly baffling writing system.\n\n\"100 hieroglyphs: Think Like an Egyptian\" by Barry Kemp is also pretty good.\n\n[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_A32.png?81768) is the best hieroglyph ever. \n\n[Although this one's pretty good too.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_A5.png?a1374)",

Further back in fact it goes back to the leather armour of Roman soldiers.\"***\n\nLeaving alone the terminology that he uses for mail^1, there are a number of things wrong with this statement^2.\n\n**Earlier examples of armour:**\n\nFirstly the Romans didn't invent armour. The exact group of people or type of armour used will most likely be impossible to track back, because it's probably Grugg who discovered that wearing a thick bear skin made Bragh's club hurt him less. But the first documented use of armours constructed specifically for warfare goes much further back than the Roman times. I'll try to list a few early finds, but the list is by no means comprehensive mostly because I only know a few cultures well enough to make statements about them. In fact I'm limiting myself to Europe and the Near/Middle East specifically.\n\n1. Europe: We have found bronze Mycenaean plate armour, usually called the [Dendra panoply](http://i.imgur.com/ZVbZX8v.jpg) from the 14th Century BCE, which is [on display in the Nafplion Archaeological Museum in Greece](http://nafplio.gr/en/stateandprivatemuseums/archaeologicalmuseummenu.html). This also comes with a [boar-tusk helmet](http://sites.psu.edu/homericrepresentation/artifacts/boars-tusk-helmet/) as described in the tenth book of the Iliad: \"*Meanwhile Meriones gave Odysseus quiver, bow and sword, then set a leather helmet on his head, stiffened inside with straps over a cap of felt, cunningly and densely set outside with gleaming white boar-tusks.\"*. Other finds indicate that they had a smaller version of this which looks very similar to a Mediaeval cuirass with added pauldrons, and something somewhat similar to a coat of plates as shown on the site called [The Greek Age of Bronze](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/armour1.htm), which is a treasure trove for those wanting to know more. \n\n2. Middle East, starting with Egypt^3: we have archaeological proof of scale armour from Egypt from the 17th century BCE (so roughly from the time of the 13th Dynasty and the Hyksos invasions), but Egypt isn't the best place to look when it comes to armour. There was a really nice looking [leather scale coat](http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/burton/p1304.jpg) in Tutankhamun's tomb (which due to mismanagement has big chunks of it missing, and the remaining parts degraded so much that most of the scales have crumbled to dust), but not even the Pharaoh's wore armour all the time. Most of the army wore nothing and they only adapted it because of their neighbours did so. Given the temperatures in the area I don't blame them. Much later on when the Crusaders arrived in the area in their mail shirts and gambesons you see a lot of reports on heat strokes and exhaustion amongst the ranks. And since you're not fighting most of the time, comfort tends to win out over protection almost all the time if you look at army organisation. So in that regard it's better to move on to one of the other ancient civilisations. \n\n2. Middle East continued: Sumeria, Akkad, Babylonia, and Assyria. Sumeria would be a logical starting point, but the picture there is unclear when it comes to armour. Yes, there were helmets at least. Some were found in graves, [there's at least one king's helmet found](http://sumerianshakespeare.com/media/2bb5ecf2c805583affff81ebffffe415.jpg) (this is a replica of the original), others are depicted on steles indicating that the common soldier wore helmets as well, but when it comes to body armour there is no clear picture on what was worn. Some steles depict charioteers, and the donkeys pulling the cart, wearing some form of leather protection, but most soldiers are shown only wearing a cloak at most (which some suggest might have bronze plates sown into it, but there's no evidence to support this). [This artist's reconstruction](http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b29/Acidophilus-Bifidus/Civ/sumerian1.jpg) shows the average helmet type in use and the cloak I mentioned. On Sargon of Akkad's victory stele from around 2300 BCE we can see some soldiers behind Sargon [bearing axes and what looks like scale/lamellar armour of some kind](http://maubkn.imingo.net/galart2/images/61/1716.jpg), but the Akkadians were generally similar to the Sumerians in that they didn't wear armour. It's not really until the rise of the Babylonians and Assyrians in the 7-8 century BCE that body armour becomes more common, [usually lamellar or scale](http://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/324370). It's still not worn by the bulk of the army, but it's not rare. It is likely that the Assyrians picked up this type of armour from their contact with the Hittites. But for my purposes they pick up the armour habit a bit too late.\n\n2. Middle East continued: The Hittites. From roughly the 17th century BCE onward we have examples of Hittite [scale](http://i.imgur.com/4HuJRjb.png) and [lamellar armour](https://traveltoeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wpid-Photo-2014110303015219.jpg). Solid bronze breast plates and pauldrons were also used, and [here is a beautiful reconstruction of a complete set of armour using a bronze plate on the chest and shoulders, and lamellar on the arms and lower body](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d4/d7/49/d4d749802452818750ad18892e16a535.jpg). This would have been an expensive suit, so not one for the common soldier. By the way [this site on historical studies and re-enactment](https://koryvantesstudies.org/studies-in-english-language/page215-2/) shows it worn with a helmet going up against the Mycenaean Dendra. I can highly recommend this [Korivantes](https://koryvantesstudies.org/page1-2/) site if you want to know a lot more than I cover here, this is academic level research. The Hittites used armour extensively in their armies and were prolific producers of metal objects, be it weapons and armour, or more day-to-day objects. Contrary to some popular beliefs, iron weaponry and armour were not very common at all. Most iron was used for ritualistic objects.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The first conclusion:**\n\nJames May is talking nonsense in regards to dating back the first use of armour to the Romans. In fact the earliest versions of what we would recognise as a plate suit are from the 17th century BCE and from the Hittite kingdom. This places it a full 1000 years before the first incarnation of Rome, the Roman Kingdom. And 1200 years before the more familiar, and expansionistic, Roman Republic.\n\n &amp;nbsp; \n\n**Sources** (these are in addition to the ones linked to in the main post):\n\n**Mycenae**\n\n- [Hellenic Armors](http://hellenicarmors.gr/?lang=EN) \n- John Warry, Warfare in the Classical World.

I know people want to use specific terminology for these things, but I honestly can't be bothered too much by this and neither could people at the time. In general chainmail is a wrong term to use, mail already indicates that it's made from small rings, so the chain part is superfluous. If you want to really show that you're an expert, French, or pretentious, talk about maille. Otherwise use mail coat or something more specific. Likewise \"plate mail\" is a contradiction in terms, even though all suits of plate armour used mail to cover the gaps. It's better to use plate armour which covers all incarnations of metal plated armour. Or full plate armour if you're talking about the iconic fully encasing suits of plate armour that European nobles used to wear.\n2. I'll cover the Romans running around in leather in the next installment because that's totally wrong as well\n3. Just calling this one out since some people leave it out of the definition of Middle East since it's mostly in Africa",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ne4ar/radovan_karadzic_did_nothing_wrong/",
        "text": "So, you may have heard that in late March, Radovan Karadzic was finally found guilty and sentenced. Of course, predictably, this created an opportunity for the Serb nationalist apologists and deniers to come out again and say that he really did nothing wrong at all and he’s just this nice old man and so on. This time round it’s Diana Johnstone, whose ‘expertise’ on the topic comes from writing *Fools’ Crusade*, a generally awful book on the Yugoslav wars which largely just rehashes the Serb nationalist narrative in English. But she’s appointed herself Karadzic’s defender [here]( http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/30/international-injustice-the-conviction-of-radovan-karadzic/), so let’s take a look.\n\n&gt; Last Thursday, news reports were largely devoted to the March 22 Brussels terror bombings and the US primary campaigns. And so little attention was paid to the verdict of the International Criminal Tribunal for (former) Yugoslavia (ICTY) finding Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic guilty of every crime it could come up with, including “genocide”.  It was a “ho-hum” bit of news.  Karadzic had already been convicted by the media of every possible crime, and nobody ever imagined that he would be declared innocent by the single-issue court set up in The Hague essentially to judge the Serb side in the 1990s civil wars that tore apart the once independent country of Yugoslavia.\n\nIt was so inevitable that he’d be convicted of “every crime [ICTY] could come up with” that Johnstone failed to notice that he, in fact, wasn’t – he was acquitted on one of the eleven charges against him, which was in fact arguably the worst of all (the 1992 genocide campaign charge). As for the claim that ICTY only judges the Serb side, over a third of its cases have been trials of non-Serbs (Serbs accounted for 94 of 161).\n\n&gt; As is the habit with the ICTY, the non-jury trial dragged on for years – seven and a half years to be precise.\n\nIn large part because, like several other charged Serb nationalist leaders, Karadzic routinely refused to co-operate with the court through things like not entering a plea and refusing to choose a lawyer when he was ordered to do so.\n\n&gt; Horror stories heavily laced with hearsay, denials, more or less far fetched interpretations end up “drowning the fish” as the saying goes. A proper trial would narrow the charges to facts which can clearly be proved or not proved, but these sprawling proceedings defy any notion of relevance. Nobody who has not devoted a lifetime to following these proceedings can tell what real evidence supports the final judgment.\n\nSo what are you trying to achieve in this article then, unless you’re saying you *have* dedicated a lifetime to following ICTY?\n\nAlso, while the early ICTY trials did indeed need to “narrow the charges to facts which can clearly be proved or not proved”, Karadzic only came to trial years later, by which time the facts of the atrocities had already been established as far as could be managed. The questions the trial actually had to deal with are twofold – firstly, do these atrocities constitute, or form part of, crimes against humanity/genocide/extermination/etc, and secondly, was Karadzic responsible, complicit, aiding and abetting, or not responsible for them?\n\n&gt; There was a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina from April 1992 to December 1995. Wars are terrible things, civil wars especially.  Let us agree with David Swanson that “War is a crime”.  But this was a civil war, with three armed parties to the conflict, plus outside interference.  The “crime” was not one-sided.\n\nI suppose you could say that, yes, but Johnstone’s implication is that “not one-sided” means “everyone’s crimes were equal”, which is very far from the case.\n\nAlso, while the “three armed parties” description isn’t untrue, it’s been heavily criticised as far too simplistic, as it implies i) each armed party genuinely represented an ethnic group, ii) there was no fluidity or middle ground between them, and iii) that the parties were all equally legitimate. All of those assumptions are at best questionable and at worst just wrong.\n\n&gt; This is quite extraordinary. The ICTY judges are actually acknowledging that the Bosnian Muslim side engaged in “false flag” operations, not only targeting UN personnel but actually “opening fire on territory under its control”.  Except that that should read, “opening fire on civilians under its control”. UN peace keeping officers have insisted for years that the notorious Sarajevo “marketplace massacres”, which were blamed on the Serbs and used to gain condemnation of the Serbs in the United Nations, were actually carried out by the Muslim side in order to gain international support.\n\nOK, just as a background, there were two Markale (marketplace) massacres, one on 5 February 1994, the other on 28 August 1995. I’m not going into what individual personnel might have said, but in the latter neither the UNPROFOR leadership on the ground had any doubt that the VRS (Bosnian Serb separatist army) had fired the shells. In fact, [they were urged to make a ‘neutral’ statement so as not to offend the Serbs too much](http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/the-second-markale-massacre-myth.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=10035), even though they knew full well that Serb forces were responsible. The first massacre is slightly more controversial, because UNPROFOR calculations initially blamed Bosnian government (often referred to as ‘the Muslim side’) forces. UNPROFOR later admitted that they’d made an error in their calculations and they couldn’t actually determine where the shell had come from, though ICTY found it to have come from VRS positions.\n\n&gt; The Muslim side was, as stated, “intent on provoking the international community to act on its behalf”, and it succeeded!  The ICTY is living proof of that success: a tribunal set up to punish Serbs. But there has been no move to expose and put on trial Muslim leaders responsible for their false flag operations.\n\nThe ICTY was established in June *1993*. I’d be quite interested to hear how, even if they were false flags, the Markale massacres in *1994 and 1995* could have caused that to happen. Also, what the Bosnian government wanted from the international community was not merely a tribunal to judge crimes after the war was over (which had already been established, as noted), but some sort of assistance in defeating the Serb forces (which, at times, particularly towards the end of the war, the international community actually hindered them from doing).\n\n&gt; The Judge quickly brushed this off: “However, the evidence indicates that the occasions on which this happened pale in significance when compared to the evidence relating to [Bosnian Serb] fire on the city” (Sarajevo). How can such deceitful attacks “pale in significance” when they cast doubt precisely on the extent of Bosnian Serb “fire on the city”?\n\nWhy do they cast doubt on the extent of VRS fire? That’s a bit like saying that if a serial killer is convicted of 12 separate killings, but later evidence comes out absolving him of one, we should automatically regard the other 11 as potentially suspect and doubtful regardless of the individual case evidence. The judgement summary elaborates quite a bit on specific examples of VRS sniping and shelling tactics in literally the previous paragraph to the one Johnstone is quoting. The extent of VRS fire is pretty well known - they fired literally hundreds of thousands of shells into Sarajevo over the course of the war. They only denied responsibility when those shells caused significant death tolls.\n\n&gt; ICTY’s main judicial trick is to have imported from US criminal justice the concept of a “Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE)”, used originally as a means to indict gangsters.  The trick is to identify the side we are against as a JCE, which makes it possible to accuse anyone on that side of being a member of the JCE. The JCE institutionalizes guilt by association. Note that in Yugoslavia, there was never any law against Joint Criminal Enterprises, and so the application is purely retroactive.\n\nThey’re not being tried under Yugoslav domestic law, but under international law, rendering this irrelevant.\n\nNow, there’s a serious question about retroactive application of new legal precedents. ICTY and ICTR have, undoubtedly, been retroactive to a considerable extent. Like WW2, Yugoslavia and Rwanda were taken as proof that existing international legal and judicial norms and institutions were not good enough, and so a precedent needed to be established. And yes, it’s often involved a bit of stretching to find a legal basis for prosecutions. But similar issues and questions were and still are raised with regard to the Nuremberg Trials.\n\n&gt; Bosnia-Herzegovina was a state (called “republic”) within Yugoslavia based on joint rule by three official peoples: Muslims, Serbs and Croats.  Any major decision was supposed to have the consent of all three.\n\nThis was implicitly rather than explicitly the case. Yugoslavia recognised six “constituent nations” – Serbs, Muslims (now called Bosniaks), Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians and Montenegrins – while all others were simply called “nationalities”. Bosnia had substantial populations of all of the first three, and so it was implicitly accepted that positions should be distributed fairly between them, and that one nation should not be overruled by the other two. Until 1990, when Yugoslavia became a multi-party state, this didn’t really mean much.\n\n&gt; After Slovenia and Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia, the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia voted to secede from Yugoslavia, but this was opposed by Bosnian Serbs who claimed it was unconstitutional.\n\nJohnstone neglects to mention that Bosnian Serb nationalists had already organised their own, Serbs-only, referendum on seceding from Bosnia several months earlier in November 1991. It’s also worth noting that the Bosnian government had been very cautious about moves towards independence – most Bosniak leaders had not wanted it until it became clear Croatia had left for good. They held a referendum in large part in reaction to the EC-set-up Badinter Commission, which gave legal rulings on the various questions of Yugoslav dissolution. Among other things, it said Bosnia merely should hold a referendum to determine its future, and if a clear majority voted in favour, it should be recognised internationally as an independent state.\n\nIt’s also very simplistic to say that Muslims and Croats voted for independence but Serbs opposed it. The divide was more geographical – in areas controlled by the Bosnian government (generally Bosniak and Croat majority areas, but far from homogenously so), the vast majority of people voted and voted for independence, including Serbs. In the areas controlled by Serb nationalist militias (generally Serb majority areas, but again far from homogenous), the referendum either wasn’t allowed to take place at all, or people were actively intimidated or hindered from voting – Serbs and non-Serbs.\n\n&gt; The European Union devised a compromise that would allow each of the three people self-rule in its own territory.\n\nWhat was each people’s “own territory”? Demographically Bosnia looked like [this]( http://www.rastko.rs/istorija/srbi-balkan/img/bosnia-karta2b.jpg) in 1991. Has Johnstone never opened a book on the Bosnian War? Because I’ve never come across a decent one which doesn’t feel the need to point out and correct the common Western misconception that Bosnia was or could be neatly divided among ethnic group areas and therefore easy to solve. Yet that’s what Johnstone is essentially pushing here. And while, as discussed below, Izetbegovic did go back on his acceptance of the Cutleiro Plan, it never actually got to the problematic issue of what each group’s “own territory” actually was.\n\n&gt; However, the Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic, was encouraged by the United States to renege on the compromise deal, in the hope that Muslims, as the largest group, could control the whole territory.\n\nRight, the first half of this sentence is true or at least close enough. Supposedly, Warren Zimmerman (the last US ambassador to Yugoslavia) told Izetbegovic that the US would recognise Bosnia as an independent state if Izetbegovic rejected the plan. Zimmerman, it is worth noting, steadfastly denies this. Personally I don’t think it matters, because this was all already implicit anyway, as both the EEC (the predecessor of the EU) and the US had already effectively accepted their obligation to recognise Bosnian independence by this point.\n\nAs to the second half, this is rather vague fearmongering. What would it mean for “the Muslims” to “control the whole territory”? How exactly would it happen, given that non-Muslims outnumbered Muslims in Bosnia? Or is Johnstone just assuming that because Bosniaks were the single largest ethnic group, that independence for Bosnia would necessarily be “Muslim rule”?\n\n&gt; Now, if you asked the Bosnian Serbs what their war aims were, they would answer that they wanted to preserve the independence of Serb territory within Bosnia rather than become a minority in a State ruled by the Muslim majority.\n\nWell, for a start, there was no Muslim majority. In the 1991 Census, Bosnia was 43.5% Muslim; meanwhile Serbs and Croats combined made up 48.6% (the remainder were 5.5% who chose to identify as Yugoslavs, and 2.4% Others). Johnstone, of course, never thinks to ask whether Bosniaks or Bosnian Croats would have any reason for not wanting to live as a minority in a rump Yugoslav state ruled by the Serb majority – which, after the secessions of Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia, really was a majority – a majority which, given the rise of Milosevic and other developments within Serbian politics, had considerably greater potential to see a pro-Serb institutional advantage than an independent Bosnia did to see a pro-Bosniak one.\n\nJohnstone also talks of Serb nationalists wanting to “preserve” a separate Serb entity within Bosnia as if one already existed, rather than it being created through the violent atrocities of Serb nationalist paramilitaries.\n\n&gt; However, according to ICTY the objective of the Serbian mini-republic was to “permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from Serb-claimed territory … through the crimes charged”, described as the “Overarching Joint Criminal Enterprise”, leading to several subsidiary JCEs.  Certainly, such expulsions took place, but they were rather the means to the end of securing the Bosnian Serb State rather than its overarching objective.\n\nThis is a bit like saying that killing someone is simply the means to the end of securing their death. They are the same action. Numerous scholars of ethnic cleansing have pointed out that creating an ethnically-defined state in an ethnically mixed area implies expulsion of ethnic outsiders, at least to the extent that the titular ethnic group, in this case Serbs, forms a clear majority. Republika Srpska could not exist without the large-scale expulsion of Bosniaks and Croats, it simply wasn’t viable.\n\n&gt; The problem here is not that such crimes did not take place – they did – but that they were part of an “overarching civil war” with crimes committed by the forces of all three sides.\n\nCrimes are committed on all sides in most wars, that doesn’t mean that some crimes aren’t a lot worse than others. Furthermore, the bulk of the massacres and ethnic cleansings committed by the Bosnian Serbs (with the obvious exception of Srebrenica) were committed early in the war, in the summer of 1992, while those committed by Croat or Bosnian government forces generally came later (most Croat atrocities in Bosnia were during 1993, while most Bosnian government ones were in late 1993 and 1994), so it’s a bit absurd to argue that Serb nationalist atrocities were committed in the context of atrocities committed by other sides.\n\n&gt; If anything is a “joint criminal enterprise”, I should think that plotting and carrying out false flag operations should qualify. \n\nLiterally no reasoning at all other than “I think this should be the case.” Johnstone evidently doesn’t understand the legal concepts she’s criticising, as she thinks to think JCE itself is the crime, rather than a concept to designate responsibility for a crime.\n\n&gt; The Muslims are the good guys, even though some of the Muslim fighters were quite ruthless foreign Islamists, with ties to Osama bin Laden.\n\nYep, several hundred foreign Islamist fighters did smuggle themselves into Bosnia to fight (many getting through Croatian territory suspiciously easy, and it has been suggested that Zagreb deliberately allowed them in). Several ICTY cases have shown that far from being directed by the Bosnian government, the latter had no effective control over them and ARBiH commanders found them a hindrance and had to forcefully stop them on occasion. By contrast, the foreign ultranationalists and neo-Nazis (most infamously, the Golden Dawn-affiliated Greek Volunteer Guard) who fought for Srpska fought closesly alongside the Srpska army, often received payment from Pale or Belgrade for their services, and were routinely celebrated by Srpska's leaders (the worst example being Mladic's raising of the Greek flag alongside the Serb one over Srebrenica due to the GVG's participation in the capture and masacre).\n\n&gt; One of the subsidiary JCEs attributed to Karadzic was the fact that between late May and mid-June of 1995, Bosnian Serb troops fended off threatened NATO air strikes by taking some 200 UN peacekeepers and military observers hostage.  It is hard to see why this temporary defensive move, which caused no physical harm, is more of a “Joint Criminal Enterprise” than the fact of having “targeted UN personnel”, as the Muslim side did.\n\nMore whataboutery. Though you could make the argument that this was just tacked on because they already had indicted Karadzic – if that was all he’d done, it’s likely no-one would care.\n\nThough here seems as good a point as any to talk about the question of equality of sides, which was a problem that the international community never managed to resolve its contradictory attitude towards. What Johnstone (and many others, at the time) refers to as “the Muslim side” was in fact the Bosnian government – both the constitutional continuation of the Bosnian government institutions that had existed as a part of Yugoslavia, and the government legally recognised as legitimately sovereign by the UN. Furthermore, while the Serb and Croat statelets had an explicitly ethnic character (indeed, that was the entire meaning of their existence), the Bosnian government repeatedly denied that theirs was a “Muslim republic”, and claimed it was a multi-ethnic state which also included many loyal Serbs and Croats. And indeed, non-Bosniaks continued to hold senior positions in the structures of the Bosnian government and army throughout the war; one of the Bosnian Army's greatest war heroes, Jovan Divjak, was an ethnic Serb; his deputy Stjepan Siber a Croat; the hero of the defence of Sarajevo, Dragan Vikic, was of mixed Croat-Serb parentage. right up until October 1993 Mile Akmadzic, a Croat, served as Bosnia's Prime Minister, while Miro Lazovic, the President of the Bosnian Parliament throughout the war, was a Serb; Bogic Bogicevic, the last Bosnian representative on the Yugoslav collective Presidency who remained loyal to the Bosnian government throughout the war, was a Serb; perhaps most surprisingly of all, given the charge that Sarajevo was supposedly run by Islamist fanatics, was Bosnia's ambassador to the US during the war - Sven Alkalaj, a Sarajevan Sephardic Jew. I could go on.\n\nNow, you can argue about how true the second part of that really was (though personally, I think the mere fact that they tried to appear as such in itself makes it at least a bit true), but the first at least, the issue of legitimacy, was a contradiction all the way through the war. The UN insisted on both the legitimacy of the Bosnian government, and mediation to find a peace between the “three sides”. UN peacekeepers were both obliged to seek consent from all parties to operate, but also only conduct their diplomatic protocol and procedure through the Bosnian government. And so on.\n\n&gt; The final JCE in the Karadzic verdict was of course the July 1995 massacre of prisoners by Bosnian forces after capturing the town of Srebrenica.  That is basis of conviction for “genocide”. The Karadzic conviction rests essentially on two other ICTY trials: the currently ongoing ICTY trial of Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic, who led the capture of Srebrenica, and the twelve-year-old judgment in the trial of Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic.\n\nI don’t see how the Karadzic verdict can “rest on” the Mladic trial which hasn’t finished yet and thus can’t have set any precedent yet. Johnstone even acknowledges that at the start of the next paragraph.\n\n&gt; Karadzic was a political, not a military leader, who persistently claims that he neither ordered nor approved the massacres and indeed knew nothing about them.\n\nDistinguishing political from military leaders in this instance is far more meaningless than in most cases. Republika Srpska was a war state. It had been established in war, and its very existence was defined by war and massacre throughout from 1992-1995. For example, neither Karadzic nor any other Srpska leader ever established where this supposed state’s borders were – only where its front lines were.\n\n&gt; Many well informed Western and Muslim witnesses testify to the fact that the Serb takeover was the unexpected result of finding the town undefended.\n\nSort of. It’s very possible that Mladic didn’t expect to take Srebrenica as easily and quickly as he did. But it was undoubtedly part of his plan to capture all the enclave eventually, and indeed the summer of 1995 had undoubtedly seen a heavy acceleration of that plan.\n\n&gt; This makes the claim that this was a well planned crime highly doubtful.\n\nWhy? Were they incapable of planning things well *after* they took the enclave?\n\n&gt; In the final stages of the war, it seems unlikely that the Bosnian Serb political leader would compromise his cause by calling on his troops to massacre prisoners.\n\nIn 1989, Bosnia going to war at all seemed unlikely as well. If you want to talk about strategic sense, it’s the same case with most genocides – they seem unlikely because they seem so illogical. Both the Nazis and the Rwandan Hutu Power regime continued to dedicate personnel and resources to massacring Jews and Tutsis respectively even when they needed everyone and everything they could spare for the war effort.\n\n&gt; One can only speculate as to what “a jury of peers” would have concluded.\n\nYes, that’s true – because who exactly would be those “peers”? Who are the “peers” of an international war criminal? What international court has ever used a jury system?\n\n&gt; ICTY’s constant bias (it refused to investigate NATO bombing of civilian targets in Serbia in 1999, and acquitted notorious anti-Serb Bosnian and Kosovo Albanian killers) drastically reduces its credibility.\n\nWell, it hasn’t reduced its credibility, except in the minds of Serb nationalists and their apologists. Sorry to break it to you, Diana, but the vast majority of the world, scholarship on the Bosnian War, and major human rights groups, while they might have minor criticisms, ultimately accept ICTY as authoritative and credible.\n\nThe Serb apologist argument that ICTY is biased essentially became a self-fulfilling prophecy. They’d inflated and propagandised atrocities allegedly committed by Bosniaks and Albanians, and thus called bias when ICTY discovered their claims to be exaggerated or just plain false. The classic example is the Naser Oric case. Oric was the Bosniak commander in the Srebrenica enclave, and had made various attacks in the Serb-held areas around the enclave over the course of the three-year Siege of Srebrenica. Serb nationalists in Serbia and Srpska, in the years after the war, circulated claims that these attacks had killed more than 3,000 Serbs, mostly civilians, including an attack on Kravica in January 1993 where ~350 people were killed. However, Srpska’s own records, later confirmed by ICTY, had known all along that the real numbers were far lower – Oric’s raids killed, at most, around 600-1000 people. The Kravica attack had killed less than 50. Rather than being mostly civilians, the dead were mostly soldiers by a rate of 2 or even 3 to 1. In other words, ICTY was “biased” by reflecting reality rather than propaganda.\n\n&gt; What exactly happened around Srebrenica in 1995 remains disputed. \n\nNo, it doesn’t, except by a fringe group of deniers, just as every genocide has its deniers, and just as people deny that evolution is real and that the world is round.\n\n&gt; In other words, even though women and children were spared, Srebrenica was a unique genocide, due to the “severe procreative implications” of a lack of men.  The ICTY concluded that “the members of the Srebrenica JCE… intended to kill all the able-bodied Bosnian Muslim males, which intent in the circumstances is tantamount to the intent to destroy the Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.” Thus genocide in one small town.\n\nJohnstone here essentially pushes a common misunderstanding of genocide – that it requires a ‘total’ annihilation, or at least intent for it. But the Genocide Convention has no such requirement – it repeatedly refers to genocide as an effort to destroy a group “in whole, *or in part*”. I hope we can all agree that the entire adult male population of a group constitutes a significant “part” of the group.\n\n&gt; Since wars have traditionally involved deliberately killing men on the enemy side, with this definition, “genocide” comes close to being synonymous with war.\n\nNo, wars traditionally involve killing *soldiers* on the enemy side. International humanitarian law does not hold and has never held killing people solely on the basis that they are adult men to be an acceptable practice of war. It’s quite astonishing here that Johnstone refers to “men”, with no qualification as to their military/civilian status, as being on “the enemy side”.\n\n&gt; In fact, not all Srebrenica men were massacred; some have lived to be witnesses blaming the Bosnian Muslim leadership for luring the Serbs into a moral trap.\n\nThis is a bit of a conspiracy theory, given weight by a few Srebrenica Bosniaks who (for good reason, it must be accepted) had a bone to pick with the Sarajevo government, that Izetbegovic wanted the massacre to happen in order to lure the West into intervening on their behalf. For a start, so what? It was still the VRS committed the massacre, not the Bosnian government. This is very much a case of victim-blaming. Furthermore, how on earth would Izetbegovic have known that a massacre on such a scale would have happened?\n\n&gt; As if to make a point, the verdict was announced on the 17th anniversary of the start of NATO bombing of what was left of Yugoslavia, in order to detach Kosovo from Serbia.  Just a reminder that it’s not enough for the Serbs to lose the war, they must be criminalized as well.\n\nDid the Serbs lose the war? Kosovo may be a different issue, but in Bosnia they essentially got what they wanted – the partition of Bosnia and their own separate Serb statelet cleansed of Croats and Bosniaks. Unless you believe that them ‘only’ getting half the country rather than the two-thirds of it they wanted constitutes a loss.\n\n&gt; The verdict is political and its effects are political.  First of all, it helps dim the prospects of future peace and reconciliation in the Balkans.  Serbs readily admit that war crimes were committed when Bosnian Serb forces killed prisoners in Srebrenica.  \n\nIn the same way that Turkey readily admits that some Armenians were killed in WW1. In reality, many officials in Serbia and Srpska (though increasingly less so in the former in recent years) continue to deny the full extent of Srebrenica and other massacres. The Srpska President, Milorad Dodik, is perhaps the most prominent example.\n\n&gt; If Muslims had to face the fact that crimes were also committed by men fighting on their side, this could be a basis for the two peoples to deplore the past and seek a better future together. As it is, the Muslims are encouraged to see themselves as pure victims, while the Serbs feel resentment at the constant double standards.\n\nIt’s an interesting suggestion that ‘reconciliation’ can only happen when all sides’ crimes are presented as more or less equal. Also, if it wasn’t so serious, Johnstone’s words would almost be funny – she talks of wanting Bosnia’s peoples to “seek a better future together” when she doesn’t want them to have a future together at all, as she endorses the continuation of their ethnically-based separatism and division. She elsewhere damns any attempt to classify the crimes committed by Republika Srpska as genocide, on the basis that it stigmatises and deligitimises Srpska and encourages it to be fully integrated in a reunited Bosnia. Because you know, keeping Bosnian Serbs in an ethno-nationalist segregationist regime away from interacting with Bosniaks and Croats is a much more effective method of reconciliation than trying to stitch a multi-ethnic country back together again.\n\n&gt; The other political result is to remind the world that if you get into a fight with the United States and NATO, you will not only lose, but will be treated as a common criminal.\n\nOdd choice of words given that for most of the Bosnian and Croatian Wars the US was pretty distant, largely leaving things to the European states to sort out, and only getting involved later in the war. But I guess blaming Germany or the EU wasn’t good enough.\n",

        "author": "YouJusGotSarged",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4n6iq2/bad_history_in_youtube_channel_history_buffs/",
        "text": "Some of you may be familiar with the YouTube channel History Buffs which reviews historical films and effectively points out their bad history (see the Patriot review). Indeed, this channel has since reviewed the 1970 epic film 'Waterloo' and rightly praises it for its outstanding production and care and overall accuracy when portraying historical events. However, as someone who has vigorously studied the Battle of Waterloo, went to the 200 year anniversary (I even found some slight inaccuracies in the museums there) and read the best history books on it, I cannot help but notice some inaccuracies in his own review and historical detailing of the Battle of Waterloo. For the sake of length and the fact that I don't know as much as I'd like to about the events he mentions in the history behind Waterloo, I will be starting this analysis from around the 12:00 mark.\n\n[Link for those looking to follow along.](https://youtu.be/sWKk5Sy0JT8?t=12m)\n\nOnto the analysis:\n\nSo, the first problem comes at around the 12:50 mark. Here Nick (as is his name), states that Napoleon won a victory over a 'small Prussian force at Ligny'. Those who are interested in this period of history will probably know that there was no 'small' Prussian force at Ligny, rather it was a huge bulk of Blücher's army of around 84,000 men. I don't know where he got the idea for a 'small' force from, but it's totally inaccurate. Further, there is no mention of the Battle of Quatre Bras in this section, which was a battle going on at the exact same time as Ligny, and very much created an early problem as he was unable to crush both the Allied forces under Wellington and the Prussians under Von Blücher.\n\nAt around 13:30, he mentions that the two farms Hugoumont and La Haye (Haie) Sainte were occupied by Sharpshooters. Whilst this fact is true on its own, the way he states it with no mention of the Coldstream Guards at Hugoumont implies that it was *only* sharpshooters. Indeed, La Haye had the King's German Legion's light divisions garrisoning it, whilst Hugoumont had light divisions of the Coldstream Guards and Nassau Jägers. His exemption of other soldiers in the farms may be accidental but it still spreads a degree of misinformation. In fact, later on in the review he mentions the KGL in the context of La Haye, so I don't know why he didn't mention the Coldstream Guards.\n\nAt circa 15:35 he talks about the famed charge of the Scots Greys. I have the most issue with this point. Firstly, he states that the cavalry charged 'as the French retreated'. No. This is entirely false. The French retreated *because* of the cavalry charge. The cavalry was committed because the Allied centre was under significant strain from French forces and thus needed relief. The British sent their heavy cavalry into the fray and routed the French infantry, capturing 3 eagle standards in doing so. At this point I would like to point out that (as Bernard Cornwall points out in his book on Waterloo) due to the high amounts of mud the cavalry was only about to advance at a trot, not the gallop you see in the film, or even in the famous painting 'Scotland Forever'. Nick fails here to mention this and even, later on at around 25:36, praises it rather than questioning the accuracy behind it. Furthermore, both the film and the painting portray the cavalry charging on a flat plain. False again. The cavalry charged down a hill, as they were coming over the ridge, when attacking the French forces. \n\nAt 15:43, he states that the 'Scots Greys charged too far'. He implies here that the Scots Greys were continuously charging after the routing French when, in truth, they were struck (as many cavalry brigades in this period and before were after and during a charge) by a case of war fervour and over confidence. This led them to charge straight for the French guns. Rather than accidentally charging too far, as Nick seems to imply, they purposefully charged in an attempt to gain more glory.\n\nJust a little nit pick for this one, but at 16:03 he says 'Neither side had gained ground'. Surely, by this he means only Napoleon, considering Wellington was rather keen on remaining atop the ridge he had positioned himself upon in order to defend it?\n\nAt 18:03, he talks about Ney's cavalry charge. He mentions it was an 'over eager attempt to win glory on the battlefield'. I'm not entirely convinced by this statement. It would appear from all records that Ney really did think the Allies were retreating and, in the heat of battle, made a mistake in thinking so and, in order to crush the Allies once and for all he sent forward his, approximately, 9000 strong force of cavalry (not 12,000 as Nick states) towards the Allied line.\n\nAt around 18:55 Nick fails to mention a crucial point here. Yes, he states correctly that Napoleon eventually committed his Old Guard (he doesn't mention when, though). What he critically fails to mention in order for viewers to understand why the Guards actually failed in this advance, Napoleon hesitated for around half an hour before committed his guards at 6:30pm. If he had committed at 6pm he would have smashed the Allied line and moved on to Brussels. However, the fact he hesitated made all the difference in the world. It allowed Wellington to reinforce his centre which, in turn, would force the Guard back. At this point, neither the film or Nick mentions that the British regiments actually charged with bayonets after their volleys, which caused the rout just as much as massed fire power.\n\nExcluding these points, some of which are rather important to understanding many events of the battle, the review was fairly accurate overall. Indeed, the film was exceedingly accurate, excluding points Nick emphasises near the end of the video and a few I have mentioned above. Whilst this review was overall a good one, it does, unfortunately, contribute to a certain degree of ignorance due to the omitting of events and points or false statements. ",

The thread is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4myp4v/what_is_surprisingly_not_bullshit/d3znmko) for some context.\n\n&gt; While the mortality rate for slaves being transported across the Atlantic was as high as 10%, the percentage of slaves dying in transit in the Transsahara and East African slave trade was between 80 and 90%!\n\n&gt; While almost all the slaves shipped across the Atlantic were for agricultural work, most of the slaves destined for the Muslim Middle East were for sexual exploitation as concubines, in harems, and for military service.\n\n&gt; While many children were born to slaves in the Americas, and millions of their descendants are citizens in Brazil and the USA to this day, very few descendants of the slaves that ended up in the Middle East survive.\n\n&gt; While most slaves who went to the Americas could marry and have families, most of the male slaves destined for the Middle East were castrated, and most of the children born to the women were killed at birth.\nhttp://www.africanecho.co.uk/africanechonews5-sept29.html\n\nThis comment is actually a direct quote from that website, which itself cites the delightful ['CHRISTIAN REVIEW OF BAD RELIGIONS AND BELIEFS'](http://www.truthandgrace.com/) and Answers.com as its sources. \n\nAnyway,\n\n&gt; While the mortality rate for slaves being transported across the Atlantic was as high as 10%, the percentage of slaves dying in transit in the Transsahara and East African slave trade was between 80 and 90%!\n\nThis is simply false. For starters, that Atlantic slave trade mortality rate, while not entirely unreasonable (although certainly on the lower end), is nowhere near the highest estimate it claims to be: even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Atlantic_shipment) gives an estimate of 12.5%. [Cohn (1985)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2121762) gives a review of estimates, which vary for specific nations, destinations and times periods, but those figures all suggest that the average across the entire period of the American slave trade is around 11-15%, certainly not \"as high as ten\". \n\nThe *really* wrong figure, though, is that 80-90% figure. For the Trans-saharan figure, [Toledano (2003 p. 30)](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gOH_AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq) mentions that estimates vary between 7-40%. For the East African trade, Clarence-Smith [(2013 p. 184)](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TLtdAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s) puts the mortality rate in-transit at between 12-21%\n\nIt's also worth asking why they picked the *in-transit* rate, when those same sources mention that the mortality rate on arrival in the Americas was much, much higher, which brings us to their next point:\n\n&gt; While almost all the slaves shipped across the Atlantic were for agricultural work, most of the slaves destined for the Muslim Middle East were for sexual exploitation as concubines, in harems, and for military service.\n\nThis really depends on what 'Arab slave trade' they're talking about: there certainly were times and places when the majority of slaves were put to agricultural work (notably, this was often subsistence agricultural, not plantation agriculture, see [Clarence-Smith 1988](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01440398808574959#.V1eaBZF96hc), [Moore-Harrel 1999](http://www.jstor.org/stable/220348)). It's pretty clear this is referring to the Ottoman slave trade, though. While I don't have exact figures, and this does seem to ignore the very important role of slaves as bureaucrats and political officials in the Ottoman Empire (gee, I wonder why they left that out), there is some truth to it. What is wrong with it, really, is it's implication: that this is evidence that the Ottoman slave trade was in some way 'worse'. So let's look at that:\n\nLet's assume that the baseline brutality of owning a human person is roughly equal (I am sympathetic to post-Marxist ideas about the unique commodification of American slaves, but lets put that aside for now). Now, we know that being a plantation slave gives you a much lower social standing in the Americas than being an Ottoman concubine or Janissary would, so it's clearly not talking about that. I think it's pretty fair to say that the whole point of this argument was to point out that Ottoman slaves would likely die or be raped. The false implication here is that *American slaves wouldn't be*. We know that, in the US, slaves could legally be raped by their owner, their relatives or any of their employees [(Smith 2004 p. 6)](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tVeh3C8XGP4C&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Rape&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s), and we also know that this was a pretty common practice. The chance you'll die a painful death in combat is much harder to discuss without reliable data on Ottoman soldier mortality rates. [Curtin (1968)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2147089) provides several interesting statistics to this end from the late 19th century. For slaves in Jamaica between 1803-17 who were over three years of age, 25 per thousand per annum died. For the general British population between 1817-36, this was 11.5 per thousand per annum. For British soldiers in that same period, it was 15.3 per thousand per annum. Although that's far from good data, I think it suggests what should have already been obvious: a life as a soldier in this period was much less dangerous than a life as an slave \"agricultural worker\", as they so nicely put it. \n\n&gt; While many children were born to slaves in the Americas, and millions of their descendants are citizens in Brazil and the USA to this day, very few descendants of the slaves that ended up in the Middle East survive.\n\nThis is a bizarre point without an actual source showing what they are referring to. However, is incredibly unlikely to be true. For one, being the children of a slave concubine was incredibly common in the Medieval Islamic world [(Lewis 1992 p. 91)](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WdjvedBeMHYC&amp;dq), and it was 'unremarkable' when many sovereigns themselves were. This would suggest that a great deal of the descendants of slaves are alive in the Middle East today, and this \"fact\" is just an appeal to the lack of slave *identity* in the modern ME. If anything, this is an argument that it was less brutal than the American slave trade: the Islamic slave trade does not continue to impact the lives of most people in the Middle East in the same way that it continues to impact the lives of black people in the Americas (although I don't think this is an entirely fair point to make given the difference in time periods).\n\n&gt;While most slaves who went to the Americas could marry and have families, most of the male slaves destined for the Middle East were castrated, and most of the children born to the women were killed at birth.\n\nI can't find any sources to back up the 'killed at birth' point, nor any evidence that 'most' male slaves were castrated. The implication in that first line, that slaves in the Islamic world could not marry, is simply false: they could marry, and often did. Regardless, it's also not unconditionally true that slaves could marry: although some slave codes, such as the French *Code Noir*, allowed slaves to marry (although not without their masters' permission), for a long time in the US, slave marriages were not recognised [(Goring 2006 pp. 302-3)](http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&amp;context=faculty_scholarship).",

        "text": "&gt;Women aimed at creating an image of innocence and a natural look during this period, some even going so far as to wet down their dresses or their stays, a form of light corset. \n\n([source](http://faculty.randolphcollege.edu/janeausten/reports/clothing.htm))\n\n&gt;Some ladies went without undergarments and damped down their dresses to add to their allure. It proved fatal in some cases.\n\n([source](http://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.com/2011/11/regemcy-era-ladys-prodigious-layers-of.html))\n\n&gt;The unusual (and rare) practice of dampening one’s gown at the turn of the century was most likely followed by light-o-loves, courtesans, ladybirds, cyprians, and women of ill repute. Aristocratic women who were confident in their unassailable status might have gotten away with such licentious behavior on a dare, and their fashion inclinations might have been considered “au courant”, but no proper lady, no young miss on the marriage mart, no merchant’s daughter looking to improve her station in life, would for a moment consider walking out in public without the protection of a chemise or petticoat, much less wet her gown to make it more revealing.\n\n([source](https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/why-petticoats-and-chemises-were-worn-under-regency-gowns-jane-austens-world/))\n\nA staple of regency historical romance, the idea that women in the early 19th century wetted their gowns and/or petticoats to make them more transparent and clingy is extremely attractive. It captures the imagination because it's so weird - Everyone Knows^TM that people were more prudish in the past, and walking around in a wet t-shirt now would be shocking, so this was shocking x 100! (Everyone also loves Scandalous Historical Women.)\n\nBut where does this come from? The earliest textual reference I can find to the practice is in an article on Saratoga Springs^1 in [Emerson's Magazine, 1853](https://books.google.com/books?id=8JNpiBpxkqoC&amp;pg=PA148), as part of some reminiscences that were given to the writer from \"an old lady who watched the gradations of fashion more than seventy years at the most fashionable watering-place in the world\". The fact that she's reporting on fashion from a 50+ year remove means that her details are really unreliable, and the fact that she apparently claims that \"the *sacques* and *negliges* of the present day are an exact copy of those worn half a century ago\" doubles her unreliability as a source. \n\nIt's unlikely that this woman or any other who reminisced about fashionable practices of her youth was making it up out of whole cloth - I suspect that the idea was influenced by caricatures of stylish dress. Examples:\n\n[Ladies' Dress, as it soon will be](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1634191&amp;partId=1)\n\n[Parisian Ladies in their Winter Dress for 1800](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1636513&amp;partId=1)\n\n[Three Graces in a High Wind](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gillray-Three-Graces-in-High-Wind.jpg)\n\nIt's clear that contemporaries were concerned with the increasing narrowness and thinness of fashionable dress in comparison to the heavier and more enveloping clothes of the 1780s^2 - note that the first two are sarcastic predictions of what fashion *would* do. The wind was especially an issue: many satirical cartoons show how the wind could press your skirts against your legs. As a result, we have a large number of images that exaggerate the transparency and clinginess of this dress - which, if you're not used to reading images as satires rather than representations, can look like soaking wet drapery.\n\nIt may have been a practice that Everyone Knew^TM that a friend of a friend had seen happen once at a ball, but if it had actually been done regularly, even just by prostitutes and daring aristocrats, there would be polemics against it in magazines and pamphlets, just as writers of the time complained about the light muslin dresses being health hazards in the winter, or the long corset being ugly and confining.\n\n(1) Not very relevant, but I'm from that area. So how cool is that coincidence?\n\n(2) And in the 1780s, they made fun of women for wearing padding in back and masculine styles. In every period, cartoonists made fun of women's dress for being too feminine, too masculine, too light, too heavy, too curvaceous, or too thin. You can't take cartoons as serious representations of actual problems with women's dress.",

        "text": "I am writing this to not only point out bad history but also for future reference purposes.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese historians believe that Chinese history is marked by a) long periods of unification followed by short periods of fragmentation and b) non-Han Chinese dynasties are anomalies, Chinese dynasties ruling China are the norm. This has already been asked about in r/Askhistorians.\n\nThe bad history post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4mhgpi/democracy_is_nothing_to_fear_taiwan_tells_china/d3wf4iw). You can go read it if you'd like. I've already answered it. To quote:  \n&gt;If you look back in Chinese history, only two (or three) times the Chinese continent were occupied by foreigners (by Mongolian and Manchurian, the \"third\" time was during the Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms period). So what happened with the remaining time was that the various dynasties self-destructed.\n\nI don't want to stop there. I want to use it as a stepping point and point out the problems with the entire idea.  \nFirst and foremost, the area of \"China\" idea is incredibly silly if you take the modern claims of the PRC. *Only* during the Qing Dynasty did one single political entity control the entire area of \"China\", which many of you probably already know.\n\nWhat tend to happen when presented with this is a moving of the goal post. But it's one that *kind of* makes sense. The traditional narrative is that \"China\" only counts the area within the Great Walls, because that is the traditional heartland of the ethnic Han Chinese, and that is what I will tackle. This idea itself is problematic, as the Great Walls itself shifted throughout the times, and there are periods of \"temporary\" control of areas south of the Great Wall by northern nomads.\n\nBut first of all, let's do the simplest thing and take a look at the [dynastic timeline on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China). For this I will address only the 2132-year period of Imperial China. I shall mark down periods of disunity and periods of \"barbarian\" control.\n\nQin dynasty 221–206 BC *Han*  \nHan dynasty 206 BC – 220 AD *Han*  \nThree Kingdoms 220–280 *Han* - *Disunity*  \nJin dynasty 265–420  \n  Western Jin (265-316) *Han*   \n  Eastern Jin (317-420) *Han*\tSixteen Kingdoms (304-439) *Barbarian Kingdoms* - *Disunity*  \nNorthern and Southern dynasties  (420–589) *Han and Barbarian Kingdoms* - *Disunity*  \nSui dynasty 581–618 *Xianbei*  \nTang dynasty 618–907 *Han*  \nFive Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms 907–960 *\"Han\"*\t  Liao dynasty 907–1125 *Khitan* - *Disunity*  \nSong dynasty     960–1279\t \n  Northern Song\t(960–1126) *Han* \t\t\tW. Xia  1038-1227 *Tangut* - *Unified?*\t  \n  Southern Song\t(1127–1279) *Han*\t\t        Jin  1115-1234 *Jurchen* - *Disunity*  \nYuan dynasty 1271–1368 *Mongol*    \nMing dynasty 1368–1644  *Han*  \nQing dynasty 1644–1911  *Manchu*  \n\nAdd those up (duplicate years obviously stand for disunity) and what do we get?\nTotal number of years of this period is 2132.\nThe total of \"unified\" Chinese dynasties is 1043 years. Or roughly 48.9% of the total period.\nThe Song dynasty is hard to count. The traditionalist *really* want to include them as a unified Han-Chinese period. However they were never able to retake the area around Beijing and the northern reaches of the Yellow River. The Northern Song is a period of 166 years, and it is as far as I'm willing to go (the Southern Song lost the entire North China plain and paid tribute to the Jin). *If* we add the Northern Song, it gives us 1209 years (56.7%)\n\nThis is the *traditional* method of counting. A unified China by the Chinese make up *less than half* of imperial history. Or just over 11/20 *at best*, ignoring a lot of problems. You see why traditionalists are so desperate to count the Song. Just for reference the orange in [this map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty#/media/File:%E5%8C%97%E5%AE%8B%E7%96%86%E5%9F%9F%E5%9B%BE%EF%BC%88%E7%AE%80%EF%BC%89.png) are the areas of under the Northern Song Dynasty.\n\nFor comparison:  \nThe total of unified China under non-Han dynasties is, by the traditional count, 401 years (18.8%).  \nThe total number of disunity involving non-Han polities 416 years (19.5%) if we only count the chaos of the Eastern Jin until the Sui unification (and I'm being lenient and starting Sui at year 581 here) and don't count Northen Song as fragmented [583 years (27.3%) if we do]  \nThe total number of disunity without involving non-Han polities (Three Kingdoms + Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) is 113 years (5.3%).\n\nFYI the total number of years involving non-Han ruling polities in both unity and fragmentation is 817 years (38.3%) if we count Northern Song as Han Chinese unified, and 984 years (46.1%) if we don't.  \nThe number of years of total fragmentation under anyone is 529 years (24.8%) not counting Northern Song, and 696 years (32.6%) if we do.\n\nOh and if anyone is still wondering about \"only two (or three) times the Chinese continent were occupied by foreigners\", during the Sixteen Kingdoms period alone, there were at different points in time 22 separate kingdoms (it's complicated) in the North China Plains area of which *only 4* were ruled by an ethnic-Han clan.\n\nEnough yet? Well I haven't had enough.\n\nLet us dispense with the traditional counting by mentioning some problems.  \n1) The distinct underplay of transitional periods. You'll notice that according to the timeline above, it seems like most dynasties took *less than a single year* to over throw the previous one. Obviously this is not true.  \n2) The ignoring of major rebellions that were subsequently crushed. Obviously we can not say China was united during the Taiping Rebellion when hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killing each other for decades, causing millions of deaths. I am going to ignore minor uprisings that were crushed in months for sake of ease.  \n3) Periods of *de facto* fragmentation. Like the Holy Roman Empire, there are times when areas nominally under the central dynasty were de facto independent, with their own tax base, their own army, their own hereditary family, and openly disobeying the central government, often without consequences.  \n\nI will *still* ignore the periods when nomads held temporary but significant control of areas south of the great wall, because I don't want to deal with digging through every single military campaign. I am also ignoring the problem with mixed ethnicity by blood (for example, the first two Tang Empresses were ethnic Xianbei) because I don't want to comb through every single family tree.\n\nBut let's just look at those three problems. Here's the [data](http://i.imgur.com/U26IuSq.png). Here are the [table and charts](http://i.imgur.com/pBOJpdB.png).\n\nJust to summarize.  \nUnified - 1110 years  \nFragmented - 1022 years  \n\nUnified Han-only polities - 809 years  \nFragmented Han-only polities - 129 years  \n\nFragmented Mixed polities - 893 years  \nUnified non-Han polities - 301 years  \n\nAll dates taken from Wikipedia.\n\nEdit - Book sources:  \n*The Open Empire - A History of China to 1600* - Valerie Hansen  \n*The Search for Modern China* - Jonathan Spence  \n*Cambridge History of China* (that I am working off from memory)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4mh42t/fun_fact_spain_was_at_least_been_partially_ruled/",
        "text": "Every minute or so, [this pop-fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/4mffy9/spain_between_1035_and_1250_705_547/) gets posted somewhere on the English-speaking internet - which I admit, is the only one I surf besides the Spanish one, which knows better than to post it. But does such claim actually have veracity behind it?\n\nLet's read the words again. What does \"Spain partially ruled by Muslims\" mean? As commonly given, some part of \"Spain\" has been ruled by a Muslim state from 711 AD (date of Tariq ibn Zyad's invasion) to 1492 AD (date of the capitulation of Nasrid Granada), though the last time one territory of the modern state of Spain was ruled by Muslims is actually 1496, year of the conquest of Melilla. 1492-711= 781 years. 1496-711=785 years. Impressive, isn't it?\n\nNow let’s go to the second part of the statement. What does \"Spain being independent\" mean? Has Spain, in its history as a state, ever been dismantled and annexed by another? The answer is no.\n\nIf you pick up a book on Spanish history, you'll find that the only time \"War of Independence\" or any similar is used is to talk about the Peninsular War of 1808-1814 against Napoleon. Despite the suggestive name, the French troops were not fighting to annex Spain into France or to make Spain a vassal of France on paper - although that’s exactly what a Spain ruled by Joseph Bonaparte as they wanted would have been. In any case, [there was a separate Spanish government that did not recognize the Bonaparte regime existing in lands that were beyond the French’s reach the whole time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Central_and_Governing_Junta_of_the_Kingdom). The term is so... unusual for the situation given, that during the run of the mill internet pissing match contest between Spanish and Latin American users I’ve even seen accusations from the latter's side that the term was chosen purely to steal it from the Latin American wars of Independence that broke out right around the same time. \n\nSo what gives? If there is no time Spain was dissolved and annexed after it became a state, maybe we can point to the time before it became a state as the time it wasn’t independent, as it is the case with most countries on this planet anyway? Well, if you ask a Catalan nationalist about when Spain began its course as a single state, he’ll tell you that it was in 1714 at the conclusion of the War of Spanish succession and the dismantlement of self-governing structures in Catalonia, Valencia and Mallorca (in spite of similar structures in Navarre and the Basque Country being maintained in some fashion all the way to the modern day). If you ask a Spanish nationalist, instead, it’s the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469. And if you go by common historiography, you’ll find that Spain is mostly treated as a… thing… with a single action and destiny, so to speak… since the time that Charles I inherits both the Castilian and Aragonese crowns in 1517. The problem is that none of these events marks the culmination of a process of independence from another power. If anything, Charles’ accession actually marks a time when local power is diminished in favor of a foreign born guy. It seems Spain’s history is turning out to be more complicated than the histories of most post-colonial states.\n\nBut not everything is yet lost. Maybe the key to the solution’s mystery doesn’t rest in the beginning of Spain as a state, but on the beginning of the predecesor states that made Spain. If Spain is the result of the union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon, as every one of the options above agree, then when was the time such crowns came into existence?\n\nFor the *Crown* of Castile, it’s 1230 AD, the union of the kingdoms of Leon and Castile. For the *Crown* of Aragon, it’s 1164 AD, the union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona (Catalonia). But wait a minute. Both events are the result of royal marriages also, and not the culmination of a process of independence from another power. Jesus Christ, does this hole ever end? How about the beginning of the kingdoms that gave their name to these crowns, as they were the most prominent among them?\n\nThe *Kingdom* of Castile goes back to the year 1065 AD, when King Ferdinand I of Leon, also Count of Castile, died and willed Leon and Castile separately to two of his sons, rising the second to a kingdom on par with the first one. For the *Kingdom* of Aragon, the solution is similar: 1035 AD, when King Sancho Garcés III of Pamplona (Navarre) unified the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza and willed them to his son Ramiro I as a separate kingdom.\n\n2016-1065=951 years. 2016-1035=981 years. \n\nOuch.",

This myth is often brought up around election time by people who want to point out that no, discourse in politics **isn't** any worse now than it used to be, and in fact might be better. \n\nThe latest iteration of this claim I've seen is from Lin-Manuel Miranda whom you should all know thanks to the enormous popularity of the musical *Hamilton*. \n\nMiranda sits down with Rolling Stone to talk about *Hamilton*, and during that interview (which you can read [here](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/hamilton-creator-lin-manuel-miranda-the-rolling-stone-interview-20160601) ) he talks about politics and the election cycle and has this to say about the Founding Fathers:\n\n&gt;So I guess the biggest takeaway is, yes, this election cycle is bizarre. But it's no more bizarre than the election in 1800, wherein Jefferson accused Adams of being a hermaphrodite and Adams responded by [spreading rumors] that Jefferson died, so Adams would be the only viable candidate. He was counting on news to travel slow! That, weirdly, gives me hope.\n\nThis insult goes back to the election of 1800. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were battling it out for the Presidency. Back then candidates didn't campaign directly, so they would employ a legion of supporters to do their campaigning for them. This would include men in political offices throughout the country, businessmen, and friendly newspaper editors. \n\nIt's from a friendly (to Thomas Jefferson anyway) newspaper editor that this insult comes down to us. A man by the name of James Callender (who had run afoul of John Adams earlier) set up shop in Richmond, VA with the financial support &amp; backing of Jefferson (who wanted to make sure that his name would not be attached to the project). \n\nCallender set up a newspaper which he called the *Richmond Examiner* and began publishing a series of pro-Republican articles and scathing indictments of John Adams. Callender called Jefferson \"an ornament to human nature\", while lambasting Adams with insults like \"a repulsive pedant\", a \"gross hypocrite\" and \"one of the most egregious fools on the continent\". \n\nThen came the doozy. According to Callender, Adams was \"that strange compound of ignorance and ferocity, of deceit and weakness, a hideous, hermaphroditical character which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.\"\n\nIt's clear from reading the actual text of the insult that the word \"hermaphroditical\" refers to Adams' **character**, not his actual physical traits. In other words, Callender was going the long way around in calling Adams wish-washy and indecisive. \n\nSo there are three things wrong with Miranda's statement:\n\n1.) Jefferson didn't do any insulting of Adams directly\n\n2.) The insult was about Adam's character &amp; behavior. Adams wasn't actually called a hermaphrodite\n\n3.) Adams didn't spread rumors that Jefferson had died. Though the Federalist party *did*. \n\nSource: The information about Callender is available many places but I used McCullough's biography of John Adams to copy the relevant bits. ",

They never thought themselves to be Roman, they never spoke Latin, the Roman language, and based most of their society on Russian Orthodoxy instead of the Roman pagan religion or even the Roman Catholic Church. The Byzantines were basically imposters, they just lived in a part of the former Roman Empire just like France or England, the latter two never were Roman states either.\n\n&gt;The Ottomans, sultans of \"Rum\" were quintessentially Roman. They were ruled by powerful \"Sultans\", (Arabic for Caesar,) and continued the secular Roman tradition of the sciences, dominance of the Mediterranean, and they even conquered Carthage (Tunis). They also practiced Islam, a pagan religion with a pantheon very similar to the Roman one.\n\n&gt;5/29/1453 was the rebirth of the Roman Empire and its culture under the Ottomans.\"\n\nI'm no expert, but there are several complete and utter inaccuracies here. First off, the Byzantines did speak Latin up until the Emperor Heraclius, if I'm not mistaken. Secondly, the assertion that the Byzantine Society was based off of Russian Orthodoxy is a bit of a logical fallacy, given that the Byzantine Empire's worship of Christianity existed before Christianity did in Russia, and finally is Islam a pagan religion? And does re-conquering Carthage make you the Roman Empire? I believe Belisarius did that.  \n\n(This is my first /r/badhistory post, so I hope I've done this right)",

        "text": "Okay, so yeah, it's Doctor Who, it's not really a serious source. They mess about with history to fit whatever this week's plot with, and they don't even do it consistently. Sometime they just take popular myths of history as fact, because it's fun that way. Sometimes they change things on purpose for fun, like making historical figures robots or aliens or werewolves or whatever.\n\nBut every now and again, there's a mistake that I feel is fair game. This is where there's no reason at all for the Bad History - it's not an intentional twist, it's not just taking a popular myth, it's just a pure mistake that wouldn't hurt the plot at all if they fixed it.\n\nThis mistake relates to Chinese Pottery, and a possible typo.\n\nIn *Angels Take Manhattan*, River Song takes note of some [Chinese pottery](http://i.imgur.com/3uADW7i.jpg) in a 20th century mansion. As a time-travelling archeologist, she comments that it appears to be from the [early Chin dynasty](http://i.imgur.com/UM9OF1m.jpg) - that is, the Qin dynasty from 221-206 BC.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem, because the pottery is clearly an example of [Chinese blue and white porcelain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_and_white_porcelain), which wasn't invented until much later, only really gaining popularity in the 14th century AD. While the Qin period is quite short, we can look at Han pottery as a similar example, because it was the dynasty immediately following Qin. [Here](http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/ceramics-han.php) are some good examples - they look *completely* different to the much later blue &amp; white porcelain.\n\nAt this point, you might wonder if River is supposed to have made a mistake. However, the owner [confirms](http://i.imgur.com/ZxNMkRP.jpg) her guess, and [compliments her](http://i.imgur.com/1RnoN4b.jpg) for it - for context, she is posing as a detective in the 1930s at this point. Then, because this is Doctor Who, we get to actually go back in time with the Doctor to [221 BC](http://i.imgur.com/gLQ34II.jpg), and [observe the pottery being made](http://i.imgur.com/hDNszew.jpg). So there's no ambiguity plot-wise.\n\nWhat went wrong here? How were they off by such a large amount? Here is my guess: while the Qin dynasty is far too early for blue and white porcelain, the *Qing* dynasty (1644-1912) would fit perfectly. [Doesn't this look right?](http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/ceramics-qing.php) My guess is that the \"g\" somehow got lost, and they just looked up the date for the Qin dynasty for the subtitle, without asking any questions.\n\n----\n\nSo that is how a single letter cost the Doctor two thousand years. It's a bit funny, because if they just changed the script and subtitles to say \"Qing\" with the correct dates, then the story would have been exactly the same.",

        "title": "The Nicene Creed was a 'vague but blandly pleasing' compromise between early Christianity and Arianism",
        "author": "PublicolaMinor",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ltn65/the_nicene_creed_was_a_vague_but_blandly_pleasing/",
        "text": "So one day I found myself arguing with a fairly typical 'ratheist', and the conversation turned to the Council of Nicaea. He was trying to convince me that Nicaea was \"where the Bible was rebooted, in a manner of speaking\" and that \"Until then, Jesus was just a prophet.\"\n\nBut this thread is not about that conversation. This thread is about [the link he provided as 'proof'](http://www.livescience.com/2410-council-nicea-changed-world.html).\n\nFor starters:\n&gt;That summer [of 325 A.D.], 318 bishops from across the empire were invited to the Turkish town of Nicea, where Constantine had a vacation house, in an attempt to find common ground on what historians now refer to as the Arian Controversy.\n\nFirst, all 1800 bishops of the church were invited. Only 318 of them actually attended. This was an time, after all, when travel from one corner of the empire to the other took months. (According to [Stanford's map of travel in ancient Rome](http://orbis.stanford.edu/), the fastest trip from Corduba to Nicaea would have taken over two months).\n\nSecond, \"Turkish\"? Really? Nicaea is located in modern-day Turkey, sure, but before that it was a Byzantine metropolis, a Roman provincial capital, and a Greek colony. The Turks were still roaming the Central Asian steppes when the council was held, and wouldn't put their name on Asia Minor for another thousand years at least.\n\nThird, \"vacation home\"? The author refers to the 'Senatus Palace', Constantine's imperial residence and center of government for the province of *Bithynia et Pontus*, as a \"vacation home\"? I wouldn't be nearly as appalled if the author hadn't doubled down, calling it a \"lake house\" a few paragraphs later.\n\nBut, to be honest, all of this is merely place-setting and appetizers for the real badhistory main dish:\n\n&gt;Christian doctrine at the time was muddled and inconsistent, especially when it came to the central question of Jesus' relationship to God. Jesus was as eternally divine as the Father, said one camp led by the Archbishop Alexander of Alexandria. Another group, named the Arians after their leader Arius the preacher, saw Jesus as a remarkable leader, but inferior to the Father and lacking in absolute divinity.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;In a savvy move that would put today's shrewd politicians to shame, the compromise proffered by Constantine was vague, but blandly pleasing: Jesus and God were of the same \"substance,\" he suggested, without delving too much into the nature of that relationship. A majority of the bishops agreed on the compromise and voted to pass the language into doctrine.\n\n&gt;Their statement of compromise, which would come to be known as \"The Nicene Creed,\" formed the basis for Christian ideology.\n\nWow. Just wow. I can't say where the author got her history, or her theology, but that's about as flatly wrong as it is possible to be.\n\nThere is nothing \"vague but blandly pleasing\" in using the term 'consubstantial'. It wasn't even a compromise. Arianism was completely and utterly routed, and Arius and his few followers were excommunicated (and Arius himself exiled) as heretics.\n\nNow for the details. The dispute in the Council was expressed in a technical dispute over Aristotelian metaphysics. The Greek term in question was *ousia* -- variously translated \"form,\" \"being,\" \"essence,\" and most commonly in this context, \"substance.\"\n\nThink of it this way: right now, you're probably sitting in a chair. The chair might be made of wood, or plastic, or metal. It might be in one of a hundred different shapes, thousands of possible sizes. Yet whatever the details, it remains distinctly a *chair*. Its \"substance,\" in the metaphysical sense, is the very \"chair-ness\" that lets us speak of a category of thing called \"chairs\" despite all the differences between each individual chair that we've ever personally seen or sat upon.\n\nThere were three main factions in the Council of Nicaea.\n\n* The Arians, led by Arius himself, argued that Jesus and the Father were ***heteroousia*** or *anomoios* -- which means \"unlike\" or \"differing in substance.\" They argued that God the Father possessed a fully divine nature, but that Jesus ('the Son') possessed something else entirely.\n\n* There was a splinter group of Semi-Arians who favored the term ***homoiousia*** -- which means \"similar in substance.\" This was a rather amorphous position that argued that, while Jesus and the Father didn't quite possess the same nature, they didn't have different natures, and that while Jesus wasn't quite equal to God, he was basically kinda 'God-like...' yeah. This didn't sway many bishops at the Council and was pretty thoroughly shot down. It wasn't until after the Council, after pure Arianism had been declared anathema, that many former Arians picked up this argument, to try to smuggle their former position into Christian doctrine under this mantle.\n\n* Finally there was the anti-Arian faction, led by Athanasius 'the Great' of Alexandria and supported by the vast majority of bishops at the Council. Athanasius argued that Jesus and God the Father were ***homoousia*** -- that is, \"same in substance\" or \"consubstantial.\"  In other words, Jesus and the Father share the same divine nature, the same 'what-ness' that makes them both fully and equally God.\n\nWhen the Council of Nicaea approved the use of *homoousia* in the Nicene Creed, it was not rubber-stamping a \"vague but blandly pleasing\" compromise proposed by a savvy (and theologically evasive) Emperor. \"Consubstantial\" was not vague, not bland, and not at all pleasing to the Arian bishops whose doctrine was declared anathema. \"Consubstantial\" was as precise a term as the Council of Nicaea could possibly have used to oppose Arian teachings.",

He refused to execute POWs, waged \"war without hate\", and took part in a plot to kill Hitler.\n\nRight. We have another case of a classical [Rommel myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rommel_myth):\n\n&gt; According to the historian Mark Connelly, Young and Liddell Hart laid the foundation for the Anglo-American myth, which consisted of three themes: Rommel's ambivalence towards Nazism; his military genius; and the emphasis of the chivalrous nature of the fighting in North Africa. Their works lent support to the image of the \"clean Wehrmacht\" and were generally not questioned, since they came from British authors, rather than German revisionists.\n\nSo was he a \"good guy\" really, a chivalrious German white knight? Let's take a quick peak:\n\n&gt; The close relationship between Rommel and Hitler continued following the Western campaign; after Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, he received a letter of thanks from the dictator. Searle argues that Rommel not only \"found favor with the Nazi regime, but (...) was delighted with the preferential treatment he was receiving\". In a sign that he \"lost touch with reality\", as Searle puts it, **Rommel wrote to his wife in October 1939 from the devastated Warsaw, where he was organising a victory parade: \"The inhabitants drew a breath of relief that we have arrived and rescued them.\"**\n\n&gt;When Rommel was being considered for appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the summer of 1942, Goebbels wrote in his diary Rommel \"is ideologically sound, is not just sympathetic to the National Socialists. He is a National Socialist; his is a troop leader with a gift for improvisation, personally courageous and extraordinarily inventive. These are the kinds of soldiers we need\".\n\nThere is so much more to go through when speaking of Rommel but it has been discussed to death, so there's no point of repeating all this really.
