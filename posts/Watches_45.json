        "text": "Recently, I purchased a PVD Bronze Alpina Seastrong Diver from their Heritage collection. The caseback, also coated in PVD bronze is solid, and very beautifully engraved. Everything is finished very nicely, and it all looks very sharp. However, I was wondering about a sapphire caseback. I doesn’t seem that this option is offered by Alpina. In fact, most of the supercompressor-style watches don’t come with a sapphire caseback, aside from the JLC Polaris, which I’ll likely by when my watch jar fills with a bunch more money. \n\nLong story short, I was wondering if any sapphire caseback for the Sellita SW-200 (the base of the AL-525 movement that the Seastrong uses) will fit the current case? I’m curious about a sapphire caseback for a couple reasons. First, the original solid caseback is engraved and nicely finished, and I’d like to keep it from getting scuffed. Secondly, I usually prefer to see the movement in action. It’s a shame that a movement this well finished will be covered, and only myself and a watchmaker will ever get to see it. \n\nAny info, tips, or sources for an appropriate caseback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!",

        "text": "Hi yall, so my dad's bday is coming up soon, and today he mentioned how his watch finally after years of wear and tear is stopping to work properly. Suddenly, I figure I'll just get him a watch then. He really likes Citizen watches, finds them to be very nice, he wears the classic bracelet solar powered one in silver. He doesn't have any other watches. \n\nI wanted to give him another watch and this time with another bezel, like a green ( his fav color) or blue. \n\nCan anyone tell me their experience with these 2 watches belllow?\n\n1. https://www.citizenwatch.com/ca/en/product/BM7251-53L.html?cgid=mens-classic\n\n2. https://www.citizenwatch.com/ca/en/product/AW1598-70X.html?cgid=mens-classic\n\nMuch appreciated ♡",
