        "text": "A few years ago I had a successful business being the proud owner of three different camping grounds. It was a stressful job which I admit took a toll on my spouse but it was also very rewarding. I was my own boss and making sure my guests had a good time was what mattered most to me. But then covid hit: the state shut me down and everyone left. During the Summer a few regulars came back but that was by far not enough to cover all the expenses. I had no choice but to sell two locations and tried my best to make the last one work. This was the one my parents started over 50 years ago so it had a lot of sentimental value as well. There was no way I was gonna give that up.\n\nI did all I could think of to get back on my feet and I even managed to get the band Papa Roach to perform in hopes of attracting a new clientele but it was all for nothing. I struggled to pay my second mortgage and I definitely didn’t have the money to pay the 20k bill Papa Roach sent me afterwards. I just assumed they wouldn’t care seeing how rich they are and all. Turns out they did care. I got multiple emails and letters in which they threatened to sue me and even harm my family if I didn’t pay. But I thought it was all a bluff. And then the unthinkable happened. I came home one day and found a letter saying they took my wife and that they would send one of her fingers for every week I didn’t pay. I was in tears for days, so fearful that they would actually carry out the threat. I prayed with all my heart the police would find her in time and return her to me safely and unharmed.\n\nBut as it turned out I was sorely mistaken. Exactly one week later a package was delivered to my doorstep containing my wife’s thumb all covered in blood with a picture of her severed hand. I fell to the floor crying my eyes out, knowing I was all out of of options and only able to scream:\n\n&gt;!CUT MY WIFE INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT.!&lt;",

One day, the river rose over the banks and flooded the town, and Jim was forced to climb onto his porch roof. While sitting there, a man in a boat came along and told Jim to get in the boat with him. \nJim said, \"No, that's okay. God will take care of me.\" \nSo, the man in the boat drove off. \nThe water rose higher, so Jim climbed onto his roof. At that time, another boat came along, and the person in that one told Jim to get in. \nJim replied, \"No, that's okay. God will take care of me.\" \nThe person in the boat then left. \nThe water rose even more, and Jim climbed onto his chimney. A helicopter came along and lowered a ladder for him. The woman in the helicopter told Jim to climb up the ladder and get in. \nJim said, \"That's okay.\" \nThe woman said, \"Are you sure?\" \nJim replied, \"Yeah, I'm sure God will take care of me.\" \nFinally, the water rose too high and Jim drowned. Jim got to heaven and was face-to-face with God. \nJim said to God, \"You told me that you would take care of me! What happened?\" \nGod replied, \"Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter. What else did you want?\"",
