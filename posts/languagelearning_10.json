        "text": "Good morning!  \n\nHow would you feel if you were given 365 new days to achieve anything you wanted?\n\nThere are lots of reasons to want to become a successful language learner.\n\nWhatever is inspiring you, here are 7 resolutions you can take to be an expert.\n\n1. Read a book: Reading is one of the fastest ways to build your writing and grammar skills. The more you read and study vocabulary, the more you’ll understand. \n\n2. Immerse yourself in English: It sounds tough, but practicing English every day is possible. Set the language of your social media accounts and devices to English and start using them! It will take some time to get used to, but you’ll soon learn new words, expressions and your understanding will improve little by little. \n\n3. Learn 3000 important words in English:\n\nCan you imagine learning 3000 new words in English? That means learning 250 words a month. It sounds like a lot, but our list of the most important words to know in English. \n\n4. Make the most of free resources: A lot of free online courses on Coursera, Udemy, etc. The materials are suitable for young learners, teens and adults alike. Elsa is an online app that can help you pronounce English words.\n\n5. Have a penpal: I know this day and age it's not as common. But with the world getting globalized. There are more opportunities to meet folks online and practice your English. Discord has a few groups to practice your English and make friends out there.\n\n6. Watch more American movies: If you enjoy learning about new topics while practising English then Netflix is for you. Make it a resolution to watch Netflix in English. The website has many interesting videos on topics like art, science, politics, design, personal development – and more. \n\n7. Listen to American songs: It’s easy to use Spotify or YouTube to listen to all your favourite English-language songs. You can also go on Google to find the lyrics (the words of the song), so you can sing along. ",

        "text": "Whenever someone asks 'how long does it take to get fluent', literally every single time the FSI numbers are brought up. And it isn't just in this sub. Google 'how long does it take to learn language x'. Basically every single article will quote those FSI numbers. \n\nYet it is funny how completely meaningless those numbers actually are (even if you take into account that you have to double the numbers because of their extracurricular work).  \nNot only is the setting at the FSI completely and utterly distinct from what a redditor may ever be able to reproduce, they also learn completely different things:\n\n[Source](https://www.fluentin3months.com/diplomat/)\n\n&gt;Typically in our final exam, we will be expected to converse at length in topics such as the environment, the political system of the United States, education, military, and countless other topics that the more casual language student may not be interested in.\n\n&gt;In addition to speaking on these complicated topics, we must also interview a native speaker in the foreign language and then translate it to English. This portion in particular can be challenging because **one must control the conversation carefully** or else the interviewee can quickly take charge and overwhelm you in a flood of words.\n\nFrom this it becomes clear that their listening comprehension isn't particularly high, otherwise there wouldn't be a need to 'control the conversation' like a youtube polyglot. \n\nIn addition, the final exam at the FSI tests only Speaking and Reading. So is there even a requirement to learn correct writing to begin with? And apparently listening isn't that important since you can control the conversation anyway.\n\nI've also seen people who took the FSI course claim that they still couldn't read a normal novel at the end. So their reading is likely not at C1 either. It may not even be B2 depending on the subject. Aside from that, anyone who has learned a language to a high level knows that non-fiction is generally the low-hanging fruit for adult learners (because technical terms are often the same as in English).\n\nSo they reach C1 in a specific set of topics that are important for their interactions as a diplomat. Yet it's also clear that they wouldn't pass a C1 exam as designed by the CEFR and it's unlikely that they would even be able to pass B2 due to the narrowness of their education. \n\nWhich ultimately begs the question: Why are those FSI numbers brought up *every single time*, even by serious publications? Is there no better way to answer the question of how long it takes to become fluent?",

Although me and my older sister can both understand the language fluently and can speak to a basic level and for most of my life I didn’t really care but recently I felt ashamed about it as I struggled to communicate to my grandparents in India so I started to learn it and I was cocky I thought I would learn it easily.Now I know I’m not the best grammatically and vocab wise and far worse that I thought which hurt my pride.It’s when I try to speak it to my mum for example I feel embarrassed as people normally will laugh at my horrible accent I know logically it’s just because it’s not common but it still discourages me from learning as even if I’m fluent as even if I speak “perfectly” what’s the point if I’m just going to be mocked. Any advice would be appreciated. TLDR:My horrible accent discouraging me from learning to speak my TL making consider just being a passive speaker.",

For context, I grew up in Brazil until I was 6 years old. At that point, my parents decided to move to New Zealand, where I spent a year of my life before returning to my home country. From there my English just developed naturally as it became a part of my everyday life, even after coming back to Brazil.  \nNever had any problem with English exams, and by the end of high school, I had the luck of having my school pay for me to take a CAE exam. That got me certified at level C2 for passing at Grade A.  \n\n\nSo basically, I haven't yet had the experience of actually learning a language from scratch! My child brain just kind of absorbed the language and then it got reinforced in my mind through years of consuming entertainment and browsing the internet in English.  \n\n\nNow that I started learning French, I'd like to hear other people's experiences. How hard was it for you to get from knowing nothing to being a C2 level speaker?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have been self-studying German for a few weeks now and I think I need some advice on how to effectively improve my listening comprehension.\n\nI have been listening to the Slow German podcast and occasional watching Super Easy German youtube videos for this purpose.\n\nI am running into two issues:\n\n1. I know so little vocabulary that I have to either pause the video every few seconds to look something up, or spend a long time with the audio transcript afterwards to make sense of what I just heard. This means that it takes me approximately 3-4 times the length of an audio piece to actually get through it.\n\n2. If I do pick out words, I cannot parse the grammar quickly enough to make sense of it. Simple SVO sentences I can manage, but once separable verbs come into the mix, I am not able to readjust the meaning in my head quickly enough before the audio moves on.\n\nI know I need more listening hours to improve, but I'm wondering if I need to increase the hours with my incredibly time-consuming active listening process, or can I just do some passive listening and hope for the best?",

But I understand it almost 90% and can speak somewhat proficiently. I’ve never studied it or tried to learn it formally. \nI speak Spanish which definitely helps given the Latin root but is still quite a different language. Somehow in Italian i just know/understand the words?  Particularly in the southern dialect that my ancestors spoke although I wasn’t raised with this being spoken around me.  By no means is it perfect and I probably make millions of mistakes and far from native but somehow it just fits?  Like it flows freely and I can think of the words but I don’t know why or where I learnt them - even words that don’t have similarities with the Spanish equivalent?  \nI haven’t spent a huge amount of time in Italy just some vacations every now and then (probably no more than 3 months accumulatively).\nHas anybody else had this happen with their ancestral language that they were not taught? I wonder if there’s something to it or if I’m making a huge stretch here.   Definitely not trying to brag as I am no linguist by any means and I’m sure I butcher the language, but I am just curious about this!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11bu3kh/reflecting_on_one_year_of_spanish_progress/",
        "text": "This week has marked one year since I started studying Spanish, and I thought I'd do a little reflection, since I always enjoy reading other peoples' experiences, and maybe someone would be interested to read mine. Unfortunately, I didn't track my hours so I don't have any fun stats or pretty graphs, but hopefully it'll be helpful to someone anyway. \n\n# Background\n\nI took three years of Spanish in high school. I had always wanted to learn another language and Spanish was the only one offered at my tiny school. My high school Spanish was not a great experience. While I didn't gain much from the class in terms of practical skills, it did give me a basic vocabulary foundation. For 10 years after high school, I dabbled in Spanish and other languages here and there without ever making progress or building a habit. Then, a year ago, a couple of kids from Colombia moved to the school where I work. They spoke zero English. I was so mad at myself that despite \"trying\" to learn Spanish for so long, I couldn't say more to them than \"hola, cómo estás?\". So, I decided enough was enough, I'm going to learn Spanish for real this time. I got on this sub, found some better resources, built a habit, and here's my progress so far!\n\n# Listening\n\nThen- A1. I started with Dreaming Spanish super-beginner videos and they were HARD. But I got so excited that \"OMG I CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND SOMEONE SPEAKING SPANISH\" that I just binged them and worked my way to harder content. \n\nNow- B1. Dreaming Spanish intermediate is too easy. Dreaming Spanish advanced is challenging, but doable. I have some native YouTubers and podcasters that speak clearly that I can follow. I listen to the news every morning and can follow the main points. I'm watching a telenovela (\"La Fan\") and can follow almost everything if I use the subtitles. \n\n# Reading\n\nThen- A1. The first thing I read was an A1 graded reader. It was challenging but like my experience listening, I was just excited that I could \"participate\" in Spanish. From there, I started with books meant for beginning readers (shout out to the National Geographic Kids Readers). My library had a ton of them available as e-books. \n\nNow- B1+. Reading is my strongest skill. I don't think I'm quite at the B2 level, but I read a DELE B2 practice exam and was able to get through it and answer some of the questions, so I think I'm close. I'm working my way through the Harry Potter series (I know it's a cliche, but I love them so I don't care). I just finished the 2nd book today and by the end of the book, reading it felt fun and easy. I think I'm at 97-98% comprehension for that book. \n\n# Writing\n\nThen- A0. I had never written anything. I didn't practice writing at the beginning. \n\nNow- B1. I can write responses to prompts from my teacher. I can write short personal letters to people on Slowly. I can write Reddit comments. I can text people on Tandem with few translations. I write in a journal in Spanish. I can write out assignment directions for my Spanish-speaking students. I'm not eloquent and I make plenty of mistakes, but I can get my point across. \n\n# Speaking\n\nThen- A0. I had never spoken to anyone in Spanish before. A year ago, I booked my first Spanish lesson on iTalki and that was my first Spanish \"conversation\". I learned how to talk about my likes and dislikes using \"me gusta\" and \"no me gusta\". I was very proud of myself at the time lol. \n\nNow- B1. Speaking is by far my weakest skill. I do think I'm still in the B1 range, but it's a struggle. My only speaking practice is my weekly lesson and a bit of small talk with my Spanish-speaking students here and there. With my teacher, I can talk about my day, answer question prompts, talk about my goals, tell her about the books I'm reading, etc. But it is not fluid, I make a ton of mistakes, and I always feel like my pronunciation is bad. It's definitely what I need the most work on. \n\n# Goals\n\nI have some pretty lofty goals for 2023. I won't bore you with all the details, but I'm trying to put in 750+ hours into Spanish this year. I am on track for that goal through the first two months of the year. I aim to take the DELE C1 sometime in 2024. If you've reached C1+ in a language and have any tips or anecdotes or encouragement, I would love to hear them!\n\nThanks for reading!

I'm a perfectionist and the nasal sounds are so challenging and tiny differences in grammar between Spanish and Portuguese leave me with Portunhol. \n\nI told myself this year that I'd continue taking classes for a full year, evaluate how I feel, then move to Italian. Yet here I am in 7 weeks into the year and I'm already tired of Port and am really ready to move on. Of course, Italian is similar to Spanish, but I've studied it before and it's different enough for me to not mix it up horribly like I do with Span/Port.\n\nI'd still practice here and there of course to maintain the level I have, but I wouldn't be active in taking classes.",

For someone is is only interested in starting a bachelor in a German College, and that really doesn't care for money (as I already say, I am working here so money is not currently an issue for me) , which of those exams you can recommend me? and why?  \n3. I learned by myself german before I came to Germany, so I lack a lot of knowledge of grammar rules and grammar structure. because of that, I'm trying to learn grammar so I can improve my writing skills (I never did that before because most of the people that I know, that knows a lot of grammar are either unable to speak or have horrible accents and speak super slowly, so I always avoided studying it in deep). Would you say studying grammar is necessary for passing the exams? and if so , which resources would you recommend?  \n\n\nThank you for your time and I apologize for make such an extensive post.  \nHave a nice day,  \nJuan",

However, I recognize that the effectiveness of the time you invest can depend on the resources used for learning. With this in mind, I am interested in knowing whether you have ever invested time in a language learning method that you wish you had instead used for a different method?",

        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am working on an community-led stewardship project in the Ontario, Canada that involves restoring a local forest that has been impacted by invasive Garlic Mustard , *Alliaria petiolata,* and need your input.\n\nA big part of this project is teaching the community about this plant, what it looks like, where it grows, what it does in the environment, and how to manage it. However, I really want to provide a more nuanced understanding to the work we are doing beyond \"invasive bad\". In this era of reconciliation I think we need to recognize the history of colonization and how that has impacted the way settlers relate to plants and the environment, and ways settlers can start to repair that relationship. \n\nA little bit of context:\n\nGarlic Mustard was historically found all across Europe to Central Asia and Northwestern Africa; From Morocco, Iberia and the UK north to Northern Scandinavia and east to Pakistan, Northern Myanmar and Xinjiang, China. \n\nIt is one of Europe’s oldest spices. With evidence of use being found in Northern Eastern Germany and Denmark dating back to 4100 BCE. It is (was) traditionally used as a seasoning, and medicine in various European cultures, and was brought to Turtle Island (North America) by settlers in the early 1800’s. \n\nThrough colonization European settlers lost connection with this traditional food which allowed it to spread through the landscape untended. It is now found all across most of the continent where it thrives in forests and forest edges.\n\nWhat I need from you:\n\nThere are so many cultures that live here now that traditionally used this plant in their everyday lives. For this reason I'd like to create an online resource on our website with all the different names of Garlic Mustard in the different languages of the people that have (had) a relationship to that plant. I've been able to find a list of names that I will include below. This is likely not all the names (not even sure if it is correct) so if you know that Garlic Mustard was used in your culture please let me know! I would also love to hear how you say Garlic Mustard in your language! If you send me a voice clip I can credit your contribution to the project.\n\nNames for Garlic Mustard,  *Alliaria petiolata*:\n\n   \n العربية: ثومية معنقة \n\nбеларуская: Часночніца чаранковая\n\nбългарски: Лъжичина\n\ncatalà: Al·liària\n\nčeština: Česnáček lékařský\n\nCymraeg: Garlleg y berth\n\ndansk: Almindelig Løgkarse\n\nDeutsch: Knoblauchsrauke\n\nEnglish: Garlic Mustard\n\nEsperanto: Oficina aliario\n\nespañol: Aliaria\n\nفارسی: گندنایی\n\nsuomi: Litulaukka\n\nfrançais: Alliaire officinale\n\nGaeilge: Bóchoinneal\n\nGàidhlig: Gàirleach-callaid\n\nhrvatski: Češnjevka\n\nhornjoserbsce: Prawy česnak\n\nmagyar: Kányazsombor\n\nitaliano: Alliaria\n\nLëtzebuergesch: Bloderkraut\n\nLimburgs: Look zónder look\n\nlietuvių: Vaistinė česnakūnė\n\nNederlands: Look-zonder-look\n\nnorsk nynorsk: Laukurt\n\nnorsk: Løkurt\n\npolski: Czosnaczek pospolity\n\nportuguês: Erva-alheira\n\nрусский: Чесночница черешчатая\n\nslovenčina: Cesnačka lekárska\n\nsvenska: Löktrav\n\nTürkçe: Sarmısak otu\n\nукраїнська: Кінський часник черешковий\n\nwalon: A des håyes\n\n中文: 葱芥\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: How do you say Garlic Mustard,  *Alliaria petiolata*, in your language?",

I’m leaning towards this in case I want to take breaks and not waste monthly fees or if I wish to also to learn other languages down the road as well. What are your thoughts?",
