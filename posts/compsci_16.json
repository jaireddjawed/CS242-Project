        "text": "Hello! I am a college student currently studying Networking. Of the basic courses I'm enrolled in this semester, one is Composition I and I'm having a difficult time staying engaged. While we were in the computer lab today, our instructor was going over something called \"Lorem Ipsum.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are unfamiliar, Lorem Ipsum is essentially \"dummy text\" that you can put in a document to either properly format it, or visualize how long five paragraphs is, for example. If that doesn't make much sense, check this out: [https://www.lipsum.com/](https://www.lipsum.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my instructor was done lecturing us on proper MLA formatting in Word, I began to think how interesting it was that we have a standardized method in place to generate meaningless, yet coherent text. Of course, the text is not truly \"meaningless,\" but is pulling excerpts from  \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero. Regardless, the result is a physically similar-structured bit of text to that of what we commonly write, which is precisely why we use it as \"dummy text.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for my question: could I take the Lorem Ipsum format and apply it to find \"meaningful literature\" on the web programmatically somehow? Let's assume I have a large data set of text files (pastebin) and only want to keep files where the author is writing something meaningful. \"Meaningful\" essentially means throwing away the 17 line Java code snippets people are sharing amongst each other and leaves me with all the crazy people venting their messy monologues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if the Lorem Ipsum format can be used to identify meaningful literature, **I'm sure there are better ways to find them, and I am very interested in those methods also!** Any papers relating to this subject is also more than welcome! Ultimately, I've developed an odd obsession with trying to discover other people's writings in anonymous spaces, as they tend to say some very interesting things. Utilizing the Lorem Ipsum to find them would make a cool research paper and be major brownie points with my composition instructor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny resources on things I need to understand to make this a working program and research paper would be most appreciated! I have an intermediate knowledge of Python, if that helps you know where my head is at.",

        "text": "\\[Please see the edits at the bottom for an important qualification\\]\n\n**Short version**\n\nLet the strings be 1) \"abcde\" and 2) \"deabc\"\n\nIs there any algorithm for calculating minimum edit distance that would give me \"edit distance = 1\" (transpose \"de\" before \"a\"?\n\nI know work has already been published on the use of \\&amp;quot;blocks\\&amp;quot; (sub-strings) in edit distance calculations (see \\&amp;quot;Secondary Literature\\&amp;quot; below) but I\\&amp;#39;m wondering if the code has already been written. If so, how would I find it? If it hasn't, could it be written based on the algorithms discussed in the articles below?\n\n**Other Formulations of Edit Distance**\n\nDamerau–Levenshtein gives me \"edit distance = 4\" (del \"d\", del \"e\", add \"d\", add \"e\") because it doesn't allow \"general transpositions\". With the modifications proposed by Oomman and Loke (1995), I get edit distance = 2 (transpose \"d\", transpose \"e\") because it doesn't recognize that strings #1 and #2 share the substring \"de\". That is, it doesn't allow for the transposition of \"blocks\".\n\nI need a formula that recognizes that \\&amp;quot;ab\\&amp;quot; and \\&amp;quot;cd\\&amp;quot; are both shared substrings (\"blocks\") either of which can be\"generally transposed\"; (moved to a non-adjacent position as one \"edit\").\n\n**Long Version**:\n\nI'm a humanities PhD trying to quantify the differences between several versions of a prose text. I have transcribed each text as a string of letters and numbers (where each symbol represents a word). Some of the differences are word substitutions or transpositions that Oomman and Loke's modification (1995) of Damerau–Levenshtein can account for (more on that below). The problem is, entire sentences have also been relocated within the text. I need an algorithm to count the relocation of the whole sentence as a single edit not a separate edit for each word in the sentence. It's a supporting argument in one chapter of my dissertation, so I\\&amp;#39;m hoping to find that the mathematical and coding work has already been done. If not, I\\&amp;#39;m wondering whether I could reasonably pay a Comp Sci grad student to write it or if that would require substantial original research. Any help?\n\n**Secondary Literature**\n\nThe following articles are addressing the problem. I\\&amp;#39;m happy to provide links or PDFs to anyone who might help.\n\nWalter F. Tichy, \\&amp;quot;The String-to-String Correction Problem with Block Moves\\&amp;quot; (1983); Oommen and Loke, \\&amp;quot;Pattern recognition of strings with substitutions, insertions, deletions and generalized transpositions\\&amp;quot; (1995); Davuth \\&amp;amp; Kim, \\&amp;quot;A better edit distance measure allowing for block swaps\\&amp;quot; (2013); T. Xia, \\&amp;quot;An Edit Distance Algorithm with Block Swap\\&amp;quot; (2008); Shapira \\&amp;amp; Storer, \\&amp;quot;Edit distance with move operations\\&amp;quot; (2007); Ann et al., \\&amp;quot;Efficient algorithms for the block edit problem\\&amp;quot; (2010).\n\n**Conclusion/Request for Help**\n\nI'm not asking for free labor. I realize that if the code doesn't already exist, I'm going to need to pay someone for their time to create it. If the code exists, I don't know where to find it. I'm wondering if you can point me in the right direction? If it doesn't exist, are you able to tell me if a capable programmer could write one on the basis of the work that has already been done?\n\n**Update/Edit:**\n\nIt seems like the perfect algorithm is impossible (per Shapira \\&amp;amp; Storer 2007). Since my strings only have one or two \"block transpositions\" total and consist mostly in the addition, subtraction, and movement of individual letters, is there an algorithm I can use as a consistent (even if less than optimal) tool for quantifying the similarity/dissimilarity of two strings?\n\n**Update/Edit 2**:\n\nI think I should clarify something. I'm working on a prose text (manuscripts of the gospels) but I've transposed each word into a symbol.\n\nSo here's an actual example of one of my strings:\n\n2a,bcdbefg:9hijk21m1nop12qfrs2tu;o1v2w2xftyb2qfzABCDEFG1H2I+1JKLMN?OP\n\nHere's another string (same story, different manuscript): 2a,bcבb2e9hYjk2גm1nopo2qfrs2αu;o1v2w2דftyb2qfzACDEGF1H2I+1JKLMNOP\n\nUnfortunately, this example doesn't have any blocks that need to be transposed but it gives you a sense of what I'm working with. To create a hypothetical example that requires block movement, we could just place the phrase \"ACDEGF\" from String 2 in the front of that string.",

I applied to this program specifically because they were one of the most flexible in terms of academic background.\n\nMy bachelor’s degree is in history rather than computer science. The school offered conditional admittance, and only require that I take some prerequisite programs in order to change my status to fully admitted.\n\nMy question is how important is the quality of the school for job prospects? This is not one of the most prestigious schools and the classes already feel somewhat remedial. I’ve basically set my own standards to do extra work in order to understand the subjects better than what simply getting an “A” in the class would indicate.\n\nI’ve even considered using this degree and school as a starting point from which to eventually apply to a PhD program at a more prestigious university. Is this necessary? What advantage would that provide me? Or is it enough that I'm using the school as the institutional pressure I need to follow through on such a complex issue as computer science?",

I have taken IT at A-Level (Grade B) and Btec (D* D* although only half the course due to personal issues) and want to take it at university to further my learning.\n\nHowever the problem I have is PROGRAMMING.\n\nIt feels weird to say but I have a bad outlook on programming. I guess because I'm not very good at it alongside the fact I wasn't taught it well, (probs why I'm so bad) i don't have a liking for it. However the majority of university courses have a module of programming within the subject and I'm debating on whether to either take a foundation year to encompass this, or just skip straight to industry instead. \n\nFor people who have gone to uni or are in the middle of getting a CompSci Degree, how much programming did you have to do and was it hard?
