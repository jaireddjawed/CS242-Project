        "text": "About twenty years ago, a colleague sent me a Honeybaked (tm) ham right before Christmas. I served it that year for our Christmas dinner, and everyone in my family loved it. (It is a boneless half-ham, pre-sliced, cured with an excellent honey glaze.)  So, on all subsequent Christmases, I would buy another Honeybaked (tm) ham, and everyone loved it. It became an annual ritual for my daughter and me to go to the nearby pop-up Honeybaked (tm) ham store and buy \"your biggest\" boneless half ham.\n\nWhen I first started buying the hams, \"your biggest\" was about 12 pounds, and cost about $55. Over the years, the cost steadily increased (the sized stayed about the same), and in 2021, the ham cost about $80. (That may have included a $5 off coupon).  When Christmas 2022 came around, I figured that, given the increase in meat prices, the traditional Honeybaked (tm)  ham was going to cost over $100, and I was not going to spend that kind of money for a ham, Honeybaked (tim) or otherwise. So, instead of buying the traditional Honeybaked (tm) ham, I went to local supermarket and bought a perfectly respectable spiral-cut half-ham,. which cost about $45. I prepared the sad explanation that I would give my disappointed family members upon their realization that we were not having a Honeybaked (tm) ham for Christmas dinner.\n\nFast forward to Christmas dinner, 2022.  The ham is brought to the table, along with all the other side dishes that we have had at Christmas for the past 25 years. And the reaction to the \"Brand B\" Christmas ham was---nothing. Throughout a week of ham, ham sandwiches, ham salad, and ham-and-bean soup, no one said a word about the \"lower-priced spread.\"  My concern about buying the less expensive ham was totally unfounded, and ultimately unrealized. \n\nSometimes our burdens, financial and otherwise, are based on concepts that exist only in our own heads. In my case, I had convinced myself that my family had an expectation which they did not have.",

I work an online job that doesn't pay much, about $750 a month, but I can work whenever I want to, and I have plenty of money left over at the end of the month to spend on other projects and whatnot. It's almost perfect. However, the issue is my job. I don't want to go into details about what it is, but because of the nature of the work, sometimes, there can be several weeks without work. Usually there is work and I am fine, but sometimes things slow down. This isn't really an issue most of the time, I can save money, but I don't like being 3 or 4 weeks without work, especially not knowing about it ahead of time. I am just trying to find ways to make $500 or more a month working for myself. Any ideas?",

I don't buy the fluoride argument. I grew up with a fluoridated water supply and yet my brother and sister, same genes same diet same everything, they both had awful mouths full of fillings before their teens. I still have none. The difference was i was a more efficient brusher. As for \"fresh breath\" toothpaste does not give you fresh breath. You're actually the only one who can smell it. If you have bad breath toothpaste won't fix it. Imagine if the toothpaste really did make your breath smell.

        "text": "I believe when cooking on a budget, soups are your friend.   \nParticularly this italian minestrone soup.   \nI am based in the UK so for prices I refer to the current local prices in my supermarket.   \n\n\nIngredients:  \n1 can chopped tomatoes  \n1 can of baked beans  \n1 small can of sweetcorn  \n5-6 few cellery stalks  \n2 carrots  \n1 brown onion  \n1 half of savoy cabbage  \n1 or 2 chicken stock cubes or a stock pot or any veggie / meat stock you like  \nsome oil and salt, pepper, italian seasoning to taste  \n\n\nDirections  \n1. Heat oil in a pot  \n2. Add chopped onion, carrot and cellery with the seasonings  \n3. let it fry untill soft  \n4. Add canned tomatoes, sweetcorn, baked beans and chopped cabbage  \n5. Pour over the stock / stock cubes dissolved in 1L of water  \n6. Bring to the boil, make sure the cabbage wilted and reduced in volume  \n7. Optionally: add some small pasta shapes or some chopped potatoes and leave to simmer untill these are cooked through  \n\n\nCosts:   \nFor me this time it came down to as little as  ¬£ 4 for 4 portions that this yields  \nso approximately  ¬£ 1 per portion, but you could stretch it a bit further by adding the whole cabbage head, another can of tomatoes, more water and a bit more pasta / potatoes if you have and it would make you even 8 or 10 portions for an even lower price per portion.   \n\n\nAdditions / adjustments:   \nThere are plenty of recipes for minestrone soup online, a lot of italian blogs claim that \"anything goes\" in this soup so of course you can switch up the vegetables for your favorite ones, you could add any meats if you like etc. - my ingredient list is based on one recipe with adjustment according to my personal preferences.   \n\n\nIf you skip the pasta / potatoes, you could easily freeze it or easily blend it to make it smooth if you like. It tastes really well even served cold in my opinion, but hot is perfect for autumn / winter season",

        "text": "(I put a tl;dr at the end because I know I‚Äôm a wordy person)\n\nYears ago my dentist gave me a flat brush and told me to put some baking soda on it and just a little bit of water, and to brush my teeth every day with that from gum line to end of tooth (sort of like how you‚Äôd paint a fence, not the circular or back and forth motion people generally do). He said it would just be an overall good way to keep my teeth clean and it was. I did it for a long time but eventually fell out of the habit.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been looking into a lot of pricey whitening products because my coffee consumption has gone way up in the last year and my teeth are starting to look noticeably stained. As part of my New Years goals I wanted to get better about brushing my teeth more often to help with this, and I remembered my old dentists‚Äô advice and thought I‚Äôd start brushing with baking soda once a day again. \n\nSo this evening I gave it a shot, and was very happily surprised to see that not only did it clean my teeth great but it also made them noticeably whiter after just that one brushing! Probably the equivalent of 2-3 days of treatments. Then I remembered how baking soda is an abrasive that can be used to clean and polish all kinds of things (I just used it to clean up a stained coffee pot the other day) and can‚Äôt believe it never occurred to me before!\n\nA box of baking soda is usually less than $1, and I know I brushed for months off of maybe 4tbsp of the stuff when I used to do it regularly.\n\nThe only downside is that it tastes much worse than toothpaste, very salty, and you don‚Äôt get that minty scented breath after. You can also brush with regular toothpaste afterwards if that bothers you, or just be sure to rinse very thoroughly. But I think it‚Äôs well worth it for the $$ saved!\n\nTl;dr baking soda is very cheap and can be used as a toothpaste to help whiten teeth. Downside is it doesn‚Äôt taste great.",

I mentioned it to my spouse because it was the one that if I was going to get an elliptical, that was the one (precor efx 546i; it‚Äôs super popular in gyms and typically runs $2k+) but we didn‚Äôt have room for it yet due to the garage being full of boxes from our move. He encouraged me to get it anyway and we‚Äôd figure it out. It was a heavy SOB but the folks we got it from actually came and helped us unload it.\n\nI checked it out and the resistance worked, but the cross ramp didn‚Äôt, and the display only worked while pedaling. I figured well, it‚Äôs still usable. After some google fu, I was pretty convinced that it just needed a battery replacement. I told my husband that was what I wanted for my birthday in July. I finally got around to pulling the old battery out and testing it with a multimeter and sure enough, it was super stock. We ordered a new battery (actually a new battery two pack) and I just installed it this morning. Everything works! \n\nTotal cost: $37 for the battery two pack, some time, and a few curse words. I‚Äôm super stoked!",

Some times I prepay early before the deadline so I can get in the previous tax calendar year as it will actually give me a bigger benefit in the following year because of tax brackets.\n\nSecondly you will typically get a in ever so slightly interest rate offered on the loan as it‚Äôs less liability /work for the loan servicer. So typically when your shopping your original loan you will get a slightly better rate not having it inside the loan.\n\nHope that helps.",
