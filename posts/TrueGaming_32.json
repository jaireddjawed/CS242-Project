        "text": "I brought up this thought experiment with a friend and it's interesting to wonder how current technology and business practices could create a new arcade environment. For example, VR headsets are still, for many people, pretty expensive. What if there were some kind of space game that had a cockpit you entered and moved around in all directions? Or what if a game that has arcade sensibilities, for example Vanquish or Bayonetta, were trimmed down to a shorter length (or even had a password system like Gauntlet Dark Legacy) and became this era's quarter munchers?\n\nI feel like an arcade would be a no-brainer to release something like a version of Smash Bros or Street Fighter VI or whatever, too. Fighting tournaments that are broadcast on Twitch and other platforms typically do have a large gathering, so there's an audience there for the arcade.\n\nI guess the question is, are people willing to do the quarter muncher thing in 2018? In this landscape of microtransactions where people will pay for cheap cosmetics because \"eh it's only a dollar\", I want to say, yes, most people wouldn't be phased by it. But really it's hard to tell. Could easily be seen as outdated and cumbersome.\n\nThese are just a few examples that immediately came to mind. How do you envision an arcade would work today? ",

I play on PC, PS4 and Switch alike.\n\nThat said, I posted on the Switch subreddit today that I got Stardew Valley on the PC and didn't get into it. Then I got it on my Switch and I got hooked on it.\n\nI play it everywhere - the couch, the bed, the toilet, my friends house, airplanes, airports, train rides, boring family meetings, doctors office - you name it.\n\nI got many responses from people in the thread with a similar experience. Some people said they had the same with Minecraft. They played it on PS4 or PC and didn't really get into it, or at least didn't get so hooked on it.\n\nThen they got it on the Switch and suddenly put 500 hours into it.\n\nThat got me thinking about why that might be. I feel like the point of these games is to build something up. You progress through the game by gathering resources, collecting resources, constructing buildings, establishing farms and farming mechanims, etc.\n\nIn other words, you are building and creating.\n\nDoes the fact that you can fit your world, your progress, into your pocket (or your backpack if you have small pockets) make these games more appealing?\n\nWith a home console or a PC you always have to be in the same spot to continue your farm. You always have to come home first, before you can enter your world and continue your progress.\n\nMaybe the mobility of a handheld is a psychological trigger that makes some people feel like they don't have to give up their progress just because they're not home?\n\nOr maybe its the feeling that your real life is more interconnected with your video game world, because you can enter it and play wherever you are?\n\nI'm not sure how to describe what I mean. But I'm sure you get it. Or am I just overthinking it?\n\nAgain, I am not saying any platform is better than another, and I am aware of the mods and advantages of the PC. But leave that behind for a second. Are building games more appealing to people when they can play them whenever, wherever? When they have full access to them anytime.\n\nDiscuss.",

        "text": "I've  become suspicious of everything AAA publishers/devs say; even when they appear  to have screwed up, I'm curious what their profits look like. I didn't actually play any of the games I'm going to talk about, but loosely  following the controversies, I started to wonder if companies like EA and Activision/Blizzard actually intend for their games to fail.\n\nDestiny  2 was one of the best sellers of 2017 despite the lootbox  controversies. Each expansion looks half\\-hearted and they somehow go the extra mile to piss off their community \\(like locking out base game  content\\). Then we have Battlefront 2's legendary backlash and now it seems EA is cutting support on it. Both of these games received massive  negative criticism about the inclusion/exclusion of certain features well before they were released. These developers aren't stupid, they just play dumb when we catch them using manipulative strategies.\n\nAnother  example was Shadow of Mordor; players called out that the last 1/4th of  the game was a grindwall that was designed to make you buy Orcs via lootboxes. 6 months later they remove lootboxes claiming that they've seen the light, when it's clear that they knew all along and simply calculated that at this point they'll make more money selling copies of the game if they remove lootboxes than they will off of selling lootboxes.\n\nEA may have honestly screwed up with Battlefront 2, but Bungie has a contract with Activision/Blizzard to make 2 more  Destiny games. Could it be that they want Destiny 2 to die so that they can drop support and get to work on Destiny 3? They always say they'll continue support for years, but maybe their plan is always to drop support after the initial sales?\n\nI  didn't play Rainbow 6 Siege or The Division either, but you can see a clear difference in the way Ubisoft salvaged those games to EA/Activison's strategy of \"Apologize, Promise, Cut&amp;Run\".\n\nDo you think this is their business plan or am I being too cynical?",

        "text": "In the past 3 months I have played EA Battlefront 2, NBA 2K18 and WWE 2K18. I only actually purchased NBA 2K18, the other 2 were rented. In playing them I can definitely say that BF2 is the best game of the 3 without a doubt when talking about graphics, actual work put into the game and how their loot system was built. I say that knowing full well it would take several months pay JUST to unlock a majority of the in-game content cause EA are bloodsucking parasites. However, the 2K series and 2K games went from being one of the best brands just a few years ago to one of the worst and seemingly no one is talking about it.\n\n**NBA 2K Franchise** \n\nThe NBA brand, specifically the NBA 2K brand, has been at the tops of the sports world. It and FIFA dominate sales. 2K didn't NEED to purchase exclusive NBA rights like EA did for Madden, it just outclassed anything EA did and caused the NBA Live franchise to not just dwindle, but outright die. All this year you could get EA's NBA Live for as low as $5 on sales that seemed to happen weekly. 2K games just straight made a better game, better modes, a strong online system and would make legitimate modifications and upgrades (The Park, myPlayer mode tweaks, 2KTV, franchise mode upgrades). It had been using VC (virtual currency) for years, but it was never overly abusive. You could earn plenty in-game just by playing the game itself. They didn't nickel and dime in idiotic ways that would make you cringe or roll your eyes. Well, they didn't at least... that was until NBA 2K18.\n\n**What happened?**\n\n2017 into 2018 has been the time of Greed Mode being activated for most publishers it seems. Im not one that bitches about a few micro-transactions here and there or about DLC, I will gladly buy good DLC, but its all about the way its handled. Ever since the mobile market became a predatory market aimed at those with compulsive buying issues or those who will spend thousands on a game because of addiction problems, it got into the minds of CEOs, CFOs and boards that this could work on console too. They were right, to a degree. See, the differences between NBA 2K17 and NBA 2K18 are massive when you watch them get played side by side. 2K17 had focus on the whole game, making modifications all over the place and visible changes in each mode. I play a lot of franchise mode, and online franchise mode. They allowed you to create a new team, up to 6 even, expanding the games teams and thus rosters. The online mode was better streamlined and fair despite the inclusion of VC it wasn't as predatory. You could be a lower rating, in the mid 70s, and still beat someone in the mid-80s if good enough. It wasn't impossible, just difficult. Their story mode was deep, interesting, long and well constructed. It wasn't perfect, but it was fun and offered a lot of content.\n\nThen it happened.\n\n2K put all their focus into their online competitive mode making it extremely expensive and constantly pushing cosmetics to buy at every turn. Also attaching attribute enhancements to those cosmetics making NBA 2K18 literally the same thing as EA Battlefront 2. Not to mention it ALSO had the card based game like FIFA's card mode which EA makes a cool billion off of collectively with the FIFA license. 2K18 really became a pay to win game at this point. Between the Neighborhood that forced you to buy your upgrades or spend hundreds of hours just to get to a respectable level 80 while someone spends hundreds of real dollars to be a 90 right away without even playing a single minute. 2K was all aboard the gravy train and had flown under the radar thanks to Star Wars being a more visible IP.\n\n**Not just NBA 2K though...**\n\nWWE has had solid games for just over a decade now starting with the Smackdown vs Raw series. It had a lot of content for years. Storyline mode, a fun online mode, full range of move set creation/modification, entrance creation, a large amount of editing options for creating your own wrestler and a fun as hell GM Mode. Up until 2K bought it they had made strides and mistakes, but each title did get better. 2K bought it and entered it into its own brand. They tried hard to add more modes to lock content behind, force purchasing extras (2K17 forced you to buy LAUNCH DAY DLC of Shinsuke Nakamura, Apollo Crews and Nia Jax all in game playable that day) and absolutely nuked the character creation suite. As of today, in WWE 2K18, they have locked varying movesets behind loot boxes, don't allow you to actually create your own character (use a quick wizard creator) and have in game purchases that are beyond insane. If you want to aid veins showing in your arms it will cost you 25 VC. Im not even joking. Much like NBA 2K, WWE 2K has locked facial hair, scars and other cosmetic changes behind paywalls. They want real life money for me to add my real life beard in game. They have attached VC to literally everything in the game at all. Oh, but you can set your oily level to 100 for free...\n\n**Where does it go from here?**\n\nEA has decided to go with the Games as Service model, but they've already hit a snag in that. The point of a Service model is to keep development costs low by releasing a single game then just supporting it and its player base through consistent in game content. It's essentially what Ark, ESO or the Destiny franchise are. EA wanted that with Battlefront 2, but they failed miserably and seem to be abandoning ship now and moving onto Anthem as their next money sucking project.\n\nSo where does that leave 2K Games?\n\nNBA 2K18 was the highest selling sports game in the United States. Until those numbers dip, they won't change anything. They did however send out an email to anyone on their list with a survey asking questions. if you got one, fill it out. They do read it. With games like Fortnite and Battle Royale currently the flavor of the month it may actually hurt 2K's sales this coming November. Fortnite has annihilated NBA 2K's player base as players migrate somewhere that is more fun and offering a better experience. The 2K experience is a slog, tiring, repetitive and lacks any ingenuity. Once you get to the mid-80s or into the 90s overall with your character its either too easy or you've done everything you care to do. They lack continually content like Monster Hunter World, Fortnite or even Destiny 2 right now. Their WWE franchise is an unmitigated disaster as it literally cannot run on the Switch, the motion capture that was done for entrances was abysmal and the amount of in game work it would take to be any good is obtuse. It is literally the NBA 2K model, but with WWE wrestlers. \n\nThis publisher is the low key worst. They are the crack-cocaine of the gaming world. They want to make addictive games and sell them directly to those who are most likely to just drop a few hundred to line their greedy pockets. They want an upfront cost AND additional cost. At least Fortnite and other F2P models freely give you the game with the option to support the platform through purchasing extras. 2K wants you to pay for the right to pay more cause fuck you pay me. No one should purchase NBA 2K or WWE 2K until they change their practices. Im not saying they cannot have VC and make some bank off their games, but I am saying that when you want in game purchasing for facial hair, veins showing, full movesets and other modifications among other idiotic things it shows that your priority isn't just making a lot of money, but making ALL the money. 2K doesn't care for its player base or making content that enhances their experience. They care about finding ways to nickel and dime you more and more. I'm done with 2K and their model that prays on people with addiction issues.\n\nTL;DR - EA and Activation are money grubbers, but 2K is basically a meth dealer who wants more and more every year.",

        "text": " This is something that I've been wondering about lately and had quite a few discussion with friends. For the past few years, it seems that in most discussions about new games that a surprising amount of people want these new games to fail. I think the most recent case has been the huge amount of people talking about there being a new Rage game and speaking as if it's already failed. Another one that I have personally brought up with my friends is BioWare's new upcoming game Anthem. It seems a lot of people just expect a bad game so they don't even give it a chance. It just seems that the idea of wanting a game to succeed doesn't apply unless it's being created by someone like CD Projekt Red or Nintendo \\(just a few examples, not only exclusive to them\\), but if anyone mentions companies that have \"harmed\" or \"done wrong\" to the game community they look the other way.\n\nNow I understand that a lot of the bigger companies have been doing scummy things related to micro\\-transactions and the such, but the game developers that are making these games truly want to make a good product. I'm not saying to not be skeptical of a game being good or bad, but I just feel that so many people want games to be bad because the publisher that's behind it unfortunately did something to another game that the community didn't like. Shouldn't we want these companies to do better and to release good games?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that many times others feel that the company is wasting time making a game that no one asked for, but I think many forget that a lot of these companies have multiple game studios working on different games at the same time. Especially in the case of Rage 2, there is a difference between Bethesda Softworks the publisher and Bethesda Game Studios which isn't even working on Rage 2.\n\nI'd love to hear others opinions about this.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8jzkl9/what_would_an_open_world_pokemon_game_look_like/",
        "text": "(Spurred on by recent rumors)\n\nI think that last year's Breath of the Wild proved that old franchises can still show new tricks, should the developers be willing to take those risks. I mean, the Zelda franchise was facing much of the same stagnation issues that are oftentimes lumped onto the mainline Pokemon franchise (moving from free form adventure to linear structured story driven experiences rife with handholding and formulaic gameplay structures), and look at how shaking up the formula worked for them, so why not?\n\nBut, let's say that next time around Gamefreak sees the feedback and decides hey, they need their own Breath of the Wild. How exactly would you reimagine Pokemon as a franchise to better suit modern, more powerful hardware? What do you keep from the old? What lessons are there to be taken from BOTW's successes/failures?\n\nPersonally speaking, as far as I see it an open world Pokemon game would need, at its core, to be built around nonlinear progression. This is the biggest potential strength but it's also probably the biggest argument against it. For starters, the gym challenge would have to be reworked around the idea that anyone can fight them at any level. While there's certainly basis for it (in canon, gym leaders adjust their teams to the amount of badges their challenger has on them), it would certainly be tricky to design what are effectively 64 different boss fights (albeit all in the same, very similar format), and make them all work well. Though, if that's the payoff for letting the player actually travel freely from area to area rather than being bounded by knee high ledges and chest high trees, so be it.\n\nThe real problem here comes in the complete redesign to storytelling a move like this would necessitate. A lot of criticism gets lumped onto how Breath of the Wild tosses out a lot of the series's legacy of grandiose epics for a more ~~Dark Souls Esque~~ Bioshock-type \"party's already over and you're the cleanup crew\" type story. I think a really good way to solve that would be to decouple the \"main plot\", your typical \"fight the baddies and save the world\" fare, from the league \"fight the gym leaders and beat the champion\" quest. Each would logically push the player to explore different aspects of the world around them, and ideally neither would be able to be completed without the other, either literally (certain story triggers requiring x amount of gym badges), or more practically, with certain high spikes in leveling in one story or another (plus a suitably challenging leveling system to prevent the usual \"overpower one monster and blast through the game\") making continuing on with the other plot easier/more convenient. \n\nSo, say you're heading towards city C, which has the next gym leader. Ordinarily you'd move first through town A, which has nothing save maybe a rival boss fight and maybe an NPC giving some monologue on a gameplay mechanic you'll never use again. Then you'd move through forest B, either running through with repels and never seeing a single wild Pokemon or running into a fucking Zubat every three seconds and moving super slowly. Finally you hit city C, and you fight the evil team in some pointless subplot sidequest before you can fight Gym Leader Dudeguy and get the Whatever Badge. Rinse, repeat, sell 10 million copies opening day. \n\nBut now apply a more nonlinear story structure. Now you head into town A. You don't get a rival fight, but the evil team IS wrecking shit in town. You kick their asses, get some exposition, and they run off. You get a vague idea that they'll be in town H next, but you don't really give a shit, because that's halfway across the map and you're heading towards city C. But first you take a detour through forest D, avoiding all the Zubats on the overworld but you see a Riolu that catches your eye, so you snag that and head over to city E, where you can stock up on supplies before your next gym battle. Slip over to city C next door, hey look the gym leader's missing. So you have to go on a sidequest learning a bit more about the gym leader's personality, their motives, what they do when they aren't kicking little kids' asses, etc., so that when you finally fight them you're at least a little invested in the stakes. You beat their teeth in, get your next badge, now you can cut trees down. But hey- the leader mentions that shit's going down in City H! You should head over there. But you could always take a trip to the mountains to check out that legendary they were chatting up in Town A....\n\nThough it's very intentionally exaggerated in scale, that's the sort of experience I think that Pokemon could offer distinctly from BOTW. Less adventure and more journey, letting the player decide their own destinations and goals. Localize the storytelling to each major area, freeing the player from worrying as to whether they're \"messing up the pacing\", while leaving a long running main story arc to let those players who want a more direct experience get a nice tour of the area as well. Reward that sort of curiosity and wonder in players, cultivate it, rather than providing tightly knit experiences as compromise. None of this i see as a reimaging of Pokemon, really. It'd require a change in engine, sure, but at its core I really doubt that these changes would make the franchise unrecognizable so much as they'd push positive changes in the game design of the franchise.

        "text": "I'm old by competitive gaming standards (30) and only fairly recently started playing competitive games such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Absolver, and so on. I also suspect my reaction speed is just on the slow end anyway.\n\nI've noticed a pattern in my play across all sorts of PvP games: after failing to respond appropriately to a particular type of attack, I will _after the fact_ get a sort of \"tunnel vision\" where all I'm looking for is that same attack so that I can be ready this time. This makes me unable to respond appropriately to anything else. It's almost like I want to retroactively fix my initial mistake.\n\nThat's maybe a bit abstract, so let's use a more concrete example:\n\nIn Overwatch, Zarya has a \"bubble\" ability that protects an ally against CC abilities. I see a teammate get hooked and almost killed by Roadhog, something I could prevent with my bubble. So for the next minute, I become hyperfocused on Roadhog, waiting for him to hook one of my allies so that I can bubble them; but this focus makes me miss other opportunities (sometimes I even forget to fire my gun at all...).\n\nOr in a fighting game like Absolver, after failing to counter a particular attack, I become hyperfocused on being ready to counter that type of attack the next time it happens, only to get my ass kicked by everything _except_ that kind of attack.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? How could you better describe it? What psychology is at play here? Should I be pursuing a more Zen-like state of letting go of the past and being a \"blank slate\" at all times, so that I can be ready to respond to whatever comes next?",

This is the same with games like Diablo 3, where there is now an optimal way to build any class in any given season. There's an optimal way to set up your gear in World of Warcraft. There's an optimal way to build certain types of characters in Dark Souls. There's absolutely an optimal way to build any character in Path of Exile. The fact that there is a \"best\" way to do something isn't new. \n\nWhat's new is that due to the constant online communities around these games, there's always people plugging away at figuring those out and posting them online for those of us who aren't necessarily min-maxers. Normally this would be something that's easy to ignore, especially in single player games, but with truly single player experiences becoming less and less common in the AAA gaming sphere, and the fact that I, and I would imagine many of you, enjoy discussing games, it becomes almost impossible to ignore. If I want to play, say, PoE with my friend because he likes it, I'm immediately embroiled in the community of that game because trying to figure that game out on your own will not happen easily or quickly, which is an expectation of gaming these days it seems like. This extends to a lot of games. It's hard to enjoy a fighting game among friends anymore because you've got that one friend who looks up tournament level combos online and practices them a bit, and then it becomes the expected standard in your group to attempt that level of play.\n\nWhat do you folks think, does the availability of online communities affect even casual and solo gaming?

        "text": "The art style of a game is often linked incredibly closely to tone, setting and genre. The Zelda games have always been somewhat whimsical adventures, and the childlike wonder and exploration is expressed well in colourful art styles - most notably in Wind Waker. The darker portions of Zelda games, such as the future segment in Ocarina, and all of Twilight Princess, are accompanied with obviously less colourful, and more detailed art styles. Light hearted farming or town simulator games like Animal Crossing are also given a really stylised aesthetic as opposed to a realistic one. \n\nSimilarly \"gritty\" medieval RPGs are often given dark, gritty and highly detailed art in their games. See The Witcher series and Dark Souls for an example of a high fidelity games in this style. Even older games or games mimicking older games like Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin go for a highly detailed, gritty, aesthetic instead of trying some stylisation. Even in the fantasy RPG genre, you could look at a screenshot of Dragon Age and compare it to Fable and see which game is going for the more mature tone. Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur also came out around the same time. The game with the more interesting story is definitely Kingdoms, however its generic fantasy art style does not reflect the tone of its story and I think gives a very disjointed feel between the graphics and the story. \n\nI can think of a few exceptions - Bastion and Transistor both have beautiful stylised, in the case of Bastion \"cartoony\" art work but still manage to maintain quite a dark tone and aesthetic. Firewatch does this beautifully with a 3D presentation as well.\n\nGiven the costings of creating high quality 3D art, do you think its possible to make a game with a darker tone and outlook, like Dark Souls or The Witcher 3, but save costs not developing highly detailed textures and models, going for a more stylised approach to art such as cel shading?",

To put this in perspective, they own id and Fallout (by extension kind of Interplay but not really). Both id and Interplay were absolute powerhouses in the 90s, making stuff that defined genres and gaming itself. And what did Bethesda make? Terminator Skynet and The Elder Scrolls Daggerfall. I can't think of any Bethesda games that were all popular in the 90s, how did they even survive? That's in a time when famous developers like Looking Glass were shutting down. And in the 2000s they made Morrowind which is far more popular but still nothing on the likes of say Baldur's Gate or even Knights of the Old Republic (popularity wise, not gameplay wise because it was right up there).\n\nIt seems to me their success really only started with Fallout 3 and then Skyrim, after which it's been MANY years of no actual Bethesda games but acquisitions. So I'm asking how did they even survive all this time and now put out id games (Doom and I just saw Rage 2 is coming out), when so many better studios were canned?",

A little while after I got my 360 I started watching achievement hunter who, at the time, were known for their dedications to completing achievements. They’d post guide videos that, in addition to being informational, were pretty entertaining in their own right because of the personalities on the team. It made me feel like a part of a community and that was nice to feel in my awkward middle school stage.\n\nIn addition, I’m a big collector, always have been and always will be I’m sure. I always loved the idea of having 100% completion for all the games I played and that drove me to go after achievements more and more. \n\nAround the turn of the console generation I got a PS3 and was infatuated by the trophy system which resulted in me buying a PS4 on launch and getting an Xbox One later on. I’ve done a lot of trophy and achievement hunting this gen, probably more that last gen, but I wonder how they will be in the future. I’ve found the fluctuation of achievement hunting communities intersecting with trophy hunters such as powerpyx and PS4trophies becoming the big names in achievement/trophy guides and trophy hunters becoming more popular in general. The Xbox side has people like maka but it seems that the Xbox achievement hunting community has died off immensely especially with Achievement hunter headed more in the direction of Let’s Plays despite the channel name and their previous content.\n\nIt makes more sense for the PS4’s trophy hunting community to be more active as the PS4 is the more popular option this generation so I’m wondering how the next generation will change int terms of the community. I also wonder if Nintendo will ever join the fray and, in classic Nintendo fashion, put some new innovative spin on this feature.\n\nPlease, achievement enthusiasts, let me know your thoughts.",

What about it appeals to your senses, and why do you think it's kept a spot in your rotation?\n\nPersonally, I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront II (The OG. After EA's fucked up their last attempt, I refused to buy their new version on principle) pretty regularly since it came out. I don't game as frequently as I used too, but I'm willing to bet I've played at least 5 hours of Battlefront II a week since it came out (barring times when I didn't have a copy to play or didn't play videogames at all)\n\nI could go on for hours about why I love SWBFII, but the long and short of it is that I think it has an all-time great control scheme and game feel (No seriously. Track down a copy right now and be impressed at how pleasant it feels to play, especially when compared to other games of the same era) and I'm a sucker for the atmosphere the designer's built. The maps the game shipped all *at least* have the Star Wars atmosphere going for them, and a lot of them are well-designed to boot.\n\nThere's also a pretty great mod community that keeps the game relatively fresh. If there's anyone pissed about the new Battlefront, my recommendation is to track down the Battlefront II ultimate mod pack, get game ranger, and play that instead.\n\nThe only thing I could really ask for out of a sequel is all to give me what mods already have - albeit it a more stable form with wider support, better graphics, etc. Space-to-ground, more heroes, more units, the whole deal. Also no EA bullshit, but that ship has sailed, been run aground, and then picked apart by scrappers.\n\nI don't want to ramble so I'll stop there, but I'm curious as to what /r/truegaming keeps in it's rotation. I'm sure there are plenty of Morrowind and Fallout 2 players out there, but what else is everyone keeping around?",

After Dark Souls I mostly stuck to rougelike's for my podcast sessions (Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Slay the Spire) but I've become burnt out on those. Now I mostly play online multiplayer games with the podcasts (Siege, Rocket League, Fortnite) but I miss playing a fun single player game with progression. The closest I've come to that experience is Monster Hunter World, which I sunk 100+ hours into on ps4, but now I'm just waiting for the pc release. I've tried playing Fallout 4 and New Vegas with podcasts on but it doesn't work very well because they're dialogue heavy games. \n\nTL;DR - What's a good single player game (pc preferred)  with little to no important dialogue that I can play while listening to podcasts.

There are many myths and a very broad distinctive folklore here in the Middle East, remained untouched and ready for an opportunist to look thoroughly into. \n\nEven with the success of games like Prince of Persia (which is loosely based on the Sassanid-era Persian culture combined with some Abbasid era Middle-Eastern aesthetics.) we never did see this style really take off.  The only AAA game that had something to do with the Middle-Eastern history and culture over the past decade, has been the original Assasins Creed(oh 2007 is 11 years ago!) and some of the follow-ups. \n\nI know when it comes to Iranian(Persian) culture, we have the Epic Poem [Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh), which has many great stories like \"Rostam and Sohrab\" or \"the Death of Siavash\" that can be greatly adapted to any form of media.

I've been playing video games for a really long time so I thought I've seen it all.\n\nWhen I was much younger I remember games like Phantasy Star series on the master system and genesis retailing at about $90 or so. This was huge bucks, most considering this large purchase for video game standards. Fast forward a little and we see even larger prices on the NeoGeo systems($650 for a home console). This was partially justified since they were cartridges were the arcade experience, but again a very small target audience can afford such luxury with single game cartridges ranging in the hundreds of dollars. Then came Capcom's Steel Battalion in 2001. Game magazine reviews' headlines or opening thesis were usually about the games high price of $200. \n\nI'm sure I missed other games in there but these type of video game purchases, of any age made you cringe a little, they were just simple purchases. \n\nThen we get to today. And this is where I'm so perplexed. How does a mobile games make billions of dollars from players willing to drop thousands of dollars on these very simple game? I'm not criticizing the game themselves. I also play games clash Royale, but these aren't games I can ever see replacing the experiences and story told through the console, pc games coming. I can never spend this type of money on a game of this caliber.  \n\nSo my question is how did it become socially acceptable to spend such huge amounts of money on these mobile games when historically expensive games were always for the small pool of video game aficionados?\n\nMy search brought me to various parodies of this.One was a south park episode demonstrating the psychological exploits these types of games use to make you become as addicted as a gambler is to gambling. Found various articles in psychology to back that argument and recently the Netherlands banned several type of loot boxes in video games. A friend of mine who was alcoholic wanted to change his drinking habits after a bad car accident  is now addicted to Clash Royale. Is that really the core of these expenditures? An addiction problem? What am I missing here? \n\nI just spend $10 on a port of KOTOR for my tablet but don't understand spending $10 on a Free game. \n\nWould appreciate some thoughts on this. Thank you ",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nSo about a month ago I made a post on this sub about why I thought that Doomguy was the best character I'd ever seen. The thing is, I didn't actually know why I thought that. I figured it was something like \"Doomguy likes shooting bad guys, I like shooting bad guys, maybe it's because he's a blank slate\"\n\nThis went down very badly, and understandably so. \"Angry man that shoots monsters\" isn't exactly the most engaging character. Since then though, I have actually nailed down the reason why I love the character so much. \n\nWhen you load up Doom2016, as someone with no knowledge of the series, you are, for all intents and purposes, a dude in power armour that was at the wrong place at the wrong time. There are tiny hints that there might be something bigger at play, but nothing that really makes any sense. \n\nThis all starts when you first visit hell and start to uncover the story of the doom slayer. I for one thought \"ooh this is pretty cool, who knew there was so much stuff going on in hell\" but then thought nothing more of it. This is also where, for me, the game started ramping up in difficulty. It makes you go from killing demons for the sake of it, to killing them because you need them to die. Every aspect of your concentration is used to kill demons, cause they hate you as much as you hate them. \n\nAs the monsters get more hideous and more aggressive, your hate builds. The hints that you are more than just a soldier get stronger and stronger. It was during the second visit to hell that I had my revelation. When the slayer's testament spoke of him being trapped and buried. I had this amazing, almost euphoric moment where I realised that I AM THE DOOM  SLAYER. I am the legendary warrior that drove fear into the hordes of hell. Then I had another revelation. The game had shaped me into the doom slayer. It made me truly hate these monsters, in a way that felt truly natural. There's a reason that glory kills are so satisfying and so rewarding. The game wants you to kill and kill and kill.\n\nSo yes, Doomguy is a blank slate. He's basically just whatever the player wants him to be. But he's also a legendary killer, who incites hate in the player, absolute fury towards the demons. Say what you will about him being one dimensional, but to me he's fucking awesome. ",

It's still fun, and I still adore the story as much as I did back then.\n\nMy girlfriend has been watching me play on and off, and at one point mentioned that this series was \"ahead of it's time\" whenever I was transferring my save data from one Volume to the next.  And she was right, it was crazy back then to release three (or four with the first .hack games) separate games, and charge full price for all of them.  \n\nNowadays, episodic games are a lot more common, but you only see them being done with smaller games, usually adventure games, but other genres have made it work.  (I haven't tried it yet, but I hear the new Hitman was great!)  So I was curious as to what other's thoughts were on larger games splitting themselves up into smaller episodes.  Of course there are a few problems, I'm writing this while finishing Volume 4 because I am so damn tired of staring at the same cave and Japanese Palace style dungeons that have been around since Volume 1, so repetition is obviously a thing that might be difficult to avoid.  It would be hard to not frame it as a cash grab as well, but I believe if done right, it would be a great way to get to play a game way earlier than if it was released as a complete game, with developers able to take player feedback into consideration with the other episodes in a way easier to digest manner then the developers of GU could back in the PS2 days.

We made it there and I was excited to see a new market open up. Proper RPGs, Visual Novels, Action Games or Puzzlers were possible.\n\nConcept games were free apps, using gyro and touch screen to play around with things, bowling and  fruit ninja come to mind. Afew years went by though and the mass market's short attention-span built a new market. Flappy bird clones, temple run, doodle jump, candy crush and angry birds began to dominate the market. The only thing these had in common was the quick-fix they gave, this already spelled the end for \"proper\" games. \n\nThe microtransaction era was ushered in, I personally attribute this to Zynga experimenting on Facebook, FarmVille had people hooked and they introduced the real money dollars to speed up the fix. The thing that confuses me about the small transactions is that most people would overlook a £10 game but will pour £20-30 into a free game to rush construction or get new units.\n\nI had hoped the Nintendo Switch would satiate my thirst for real games on the go but it's slightly too big to be in a pocket and people are porting the same shovelware from mobile onto it and muddying the waters.\n\nMaybe I'm being pessimistic about the whole thing, if I am please change my mind, I'd like to have some hope for this industry.\n\n\n\nPs: I'm aware I can play on an emulator but there is never anything new for old consoles.",

This has meant that as a franchise it has retained an aura of mysteriousness and is iconic and thus a video game might garner some interest. As a video game might do more justice to Dirty Harry than a Hollywood remake could.\n\nIdeally a Dirty Harry game would be free roam. Set in 1970's San Francisco \\(although you should be able to travel around at least other areas in California\\) you would play the titular protagonist but it would not be based on any of the films.\n\nThe player would be able to explore a thriving \\(but conflicted\\) city. You could travel around the game \\(on trams as well as cars and buses\\).\n\nIt would give players to chance to bust  crime but unlike Mafia 3, there would be lots of chances to do side missions unrelated to the main storyline. Plus Harry Callahan blurs interesting lines because he is brutal but nonetheless tries to uphold the law.\n\nAdvantages of such a game.\n\n1\\) Iconic. Dirty Harry is arguably the greatest thriller film ever and set the pace for cop films as they are known today. People would play for the nostalgia alone. It has yet to be touches by a Hollywood remake and retains a fresh aspect.\n\n2\\) While lots of cop film have explored LA and New York. San Francisco is a city worth exploring further.\n\n3\\) The 1970's is an interesting era for games. The themes of urban decay and unresolved tensions remain. Furthermore, there  is transport like we know today \\(cars, planes, etc,etc\\). However, there is still an old school feel. Although I don't believe the Golden State Killer was active much in San Francisco it has nonetheless brought back an interest into the serial killers of the 1970's \\(and 80's\\).  Maybe Dirty Harry there could be side missions exploring one of these.",

Basically I find that despite playing games fairly often and trying to keep up with news about upcoming games, I just can't recapture that feeling I had as a teenager when a game I was looking forward to was coming out.\n\nBack when the first Red Dead Redemption was released I was 17. I was very big into Westerns at the time and loved any kind of Western themed game. So naturally I was fucking stoked about Red Dead. The entire year leading up to its release I was constantly checking for news about it, posting in Rockstars forum, rewatching the trailers and teasers over and over. I spent every day counting down to the release. I don't think there were any other games I've been excited for as much as that one and when I finally got to play it was incredibly satisfying and I spent probably that whole week completely engrossed in the game world and story.\n\nFast forward 8 years later (holy shit does time fly) and I'm 25 and Red Dead 2 is right around the corner. Now, although I'm looking forward to the game, I just can't feel that same excitement I did back then. Maybe part of it is just that I've got more stress and other things going on my life now but the \"magic\" of games just seems to be gone for me. After watching the new RDR2 trailer my reaction was pretty subdued. I thought it looked cool and I'm sure will be a great game but I'm not marking it off on my calendar and checking off the days. I just figure that when the game does release I'll no doubt hear about it and then pick up a copy eventually. I know though that if 17 year old me was the one watching that trailer his mind would have been blown completely. I would have had a completely different attitude to the \"Eh it looks cool I'll check it out eventually\" attitude that I have now.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen to them? Is it just a symptom of getting older and being burned out by the \"hype cycle\" surrounding new games? Most importantly is there a way to recapture that same feeling I had when I was younger and actually get myself excited about gaming again? Interested to hear your thoughts on this.",
