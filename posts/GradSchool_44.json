The professor’s group is really big and he is very well known. But his PhD students publish very less and many graduate with just one first author paper. But the postdocs seem to be the ones who publish a lot. I am a little bit worried because I see a lot of people from other groups who publish more during their PhD. \n\nHow are publications looked at when applying for faculty positions? Is this not a good fit for me if I am considering academia? What conversations/questions should I ask the prof? \n\nThanks much! Any input would be really helpful! I don’t know who to ask advise or inputs really!",

Don’t do that. Zotero has an import wizard for Mendeley. It’s super easy. It took 30 seconds. The only thing I had to do was create new folders in Zotero to sort my docs as I had them in Mendeley. No more constantly having to log in despite having “keep me logged in” checked. No more interruptions from the syncing function. It’s great. I love Zotero. \n\nImported highlights and stickies are locked. But that hasn’t really bothered me. I think I can still change the color of the highlight/sticky to one that indicates “old, don’t use” if need be. \n\nAdditionally, my university blocked Mendeley’s add-on for in-text citations through their Microsoft Office licensing. I thought that was odd because my university is obsessed with Elsevier. But the Zotero add-on works just fine with Word. \n\nI’ve also heard that Zotero’s customer assistance is awesome and actually helpful. I’ve never called Mendeley, but I just know it has to be terrible. \n\nIf you’re looking for a sign to get rid of Mendeley. Do it!",

With my masters degree I will have decent opportunities in my field, that I would enjoy, maybe even in research. Honestly I view having a PhD as being similar. There’s a high likelihood that I would be an adjunct professor unable to conduct research.\n\nThe last couple of years have been rough and I have limitations. I am married and my husband’s job requires him to stay in our current city (he makes more money than I ever will). We are pregnant. My dad recently died and there’s no way I’m moving cities and leaving my mom behind. Basically, I am not willing to move.\n\nThe program I’m looking at is local, prestigious, and exactly what I want to study. The advisor is also amazing. It feels right. I’m not willing to uproot my life for just any program or university.\n\nBut it also feels wrong to think this way. I worry that I won’t be taken seriously unless I’m willing to do anything for a PhD like it’s my main objective.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it’s more logical and impactful, and is a good reason to attend this particular program?",

I did biochem research project for 1.5 years, presented my poster at 4 different conferences, and was a coauthor for an oral presentation at the American Chemical Society’s (ACS) national meeting this spring.

I am a member of the Honors program at my uni, have several departmental awards, and was also on the NCAA Division II tennis team for 4 years.

While my undergraduate GPA is pretty decent (3.8), I'm entering research kind of late. I'm starting my senior year and only now working on some research projects with my profs and psi chi honor society. So i will only have about a years worth of research experience by the time id be applying to grad school. Not to mention I'm at a university with low research funds to begin with. Especially in neuroscience. \n\nI wanted to get into an REU this summer. But learned I'm probably too late and will be graduating before any summer REUs take place. So I was wanting to get into a post bac research opportunity but don't know where to start looking for that. Like I said my GPA is pretty decent and I do have some minor research experience. Also I'm from underrepresented groups (Transgender Woman and Disabled) and I noticed that many post baccalaureates look for underrepresented people so I'm not sure if I have opportunities there, I have heard that they are pretty competitive. \n\nAre post baccalaureates something I could apply for and actually have a chance of getting into? If not are there other opportunities for me to gather some research experience before applying to grad school to improve my research experience?",

        "text": "I'll likely be able to defend this coming spring semester, but due to recent struggles with my mental health and just feeling like I have a lot of catching up in life to do due to the workload of grad school, I do not want to jump straight into a full-time job a week after graduating like I've seen so many of my colleagues do. Assuming I do finish around April-May, ideally I would like to start a job around September and use the summer months as a break\\*.\n\nI wanted to ask if anyone here has done something similar, and how you went about applying for jobs with this kind of plan in mind. Also, is this something I should bring up to employers if I were to start applying for jobs while still in school? And how do employers generally view a break of this nature?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\n\\*When I say break I don't mean doing nothing the entire summer. Maybe 1-2 weeks of this time would be for actual vacation, but the rest would be for other doing personal projects/volunteer work I've wanted to do.",

I have met two PIs whose research I am interested in and are interested in me and willing to have me join their labs. Both have similar pros/cons: \n\nNeither was my first choice in research topic. Those labs ended up being too competitive and filled up before I could join. I’m equally interested in both options available to me now. \n\nNeither will pay (unfortunately).\n\nI connected well with both PIs and some other grad students in each lab. \n\nOne of the PIs asked to inform him of a decision by tomorrow morning so that he can have time to find another student if I were to decline. I am stuck with this decision. I cannot stop overthinking about how I will miss out on one of them. I am going back and forth and thinking about how it will affect my future. I am considering a PhD after this degree. How hard is it to move to a different research area for a PhD if the lab I choose now does not end up being for me? How feasible/beneficial would it be to kind of do both (Do thesis with one, just volunteer with the other)? Or would that be a waste of time? Or would it even be rude to offer volunteering to a PI whom with I was just dicussing the possibility of taking on a whole project? I don‘t get many opportunities ever so I find it impossible to completely let go of any. \n\nI feel paralyzed in this decision and I know I am probably making it a huge deal in my head when maybe that isn’t the case. Any advice on how to navigate a decision of this type (whether its what to consider or what I need to let go of) would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.",

She won’t meet with me, doesn’t respond to questions I send her, cancels meetings that we do schedule, but then complains that I’m not doing things exactly the way she outlined. \n\nShe apologized at one point after a pretty mean email, and she seemed to be more collaborative, but then it came time for the paper to be due. I had worked extensively on the statistical analysis and visualizations and she kept telling me that she was writing the paper, but decided to do so in a markdown file rather than in our shared document. I asked her to tell me which sections she was working on so I could work on the other sections, but she didn’t respond, she just kept saying she was writing the paper and would send it to me soon, then continuously pushing back when she would send it. \n\nShe finally sent me an email at about 9pm the night before it was due and told me that she’s attached the paper. I open the attached file and it’s a markdown file with messy sentence fragments about what she did in between lines of code. She wasn’t terribly responsive when I tried to email her about it, so I did my best to just clean up and format what she had written, then add my own methods, results, and discussion. However, given the time constraints, I was no miracle worker. I sent her my final copy at about midnight. She responded at 7am saying it was great and I could send it to the professor, but I should attach my code as well. I did so, copying her to the email. She immediately responded to both myself and the professor saying that is NOT the final draft, it was full of errors, but she would correct it and send the final copy. She took responsibility for missing the mistakes, but I can’t help but feel defensive that she decided to complain about the paper TO THE PROFESSOR right after I turned it in after telling me it was great.\n\nPart of me really wants to email him and let him know what I was dealing with. The other part of me is worried that it would just look bad on me, that I turned in a paper with errors and then I’m complaining about my partner. I honestly had emailed him initially saying I didn’t want to work with her because of the angry email she had sent me that just felt disrespectful, but I said I would work through it after she apologized. I don’t want it to look like big drama, but who in the world sends a markdown file of messy notes that aren’t even complete sentences, calls it a paper on the night before the paper is due, then publicly complains about the grammatical errors???\n\nTl;Dr sometimes group projects suck",
