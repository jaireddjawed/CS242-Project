My next venture would be triple sec as I'm wanting to stockpile my little home bar. I've found a great recipe for diy triple sec on the serious eats website but its a standard infusion taking essentially 23 days from start to finish. I'm curious if anyone has used sous vide to make triple sec? \n\nThe recipe:\n1/4 cup zest from 3 small navel oranges\n1 tablespoon dried bitter orange peel\n1 cup brandy\n1 cup vodka\n4 whole cloves\n2 cups sugar \n1 1/2 cups water\n\nFrom there in a sealed container letting the zest, bitter orange, brandy and vodka infuse for 19 days and on day 20 adding the cloves and letting infuse for a day, after all that making the simple syrup and combining both. \n\nAny insight?",

        "text": "**TL;DR: Any suggestions for main dishes for 14 adults to be served for dinner, 1-1.5 hours into a kid‚Äôs bday party at a park? Thanks!**\n\nWe are having my kid‚Äôs 3rd birthday party on Saturday, very casual at a park, just a few friends and family, 23 people (4x 3 year olds, 5x 6 year olds, 14x adults).\n\nParty will be at 4pm and we‚Äôll have dinner and cake. Prob eat around 5 or 5:30pm. The park is a mile from our house, and I don‚Äôt think they have grills there. \n\nOur plan was to just do pizza, as it‚Äôs easy, and kids actually like it. But it seems like every kids birthday party I‚Äôve been to has done pizza, whether it‚Äôs at Chuck E Cheese, a park, gymnastics, mini golf, etc. We always have a taco guy at my 6 year olds birthdays, and I feel like it is a big hit‚Ä¶ maybe just cuz it‚Äôs something different than pizza!\n\nI was thinking we could maybe just do pizza for the kids, and cook something for the adults. Sides are easy, we can do some salads or something. Any suggestions for a main dish?\n\nI was thinking maybe Kenji‚Äôs oven baked wings?\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-buffalo-wings-oven-fried-wings-recipe\n\nIs it really 1 lb of wings per person though? Not sure how many batches that would be in the oven, and then trying to keep them warm before transporting them‚Ä¶ maybe I can just do grilled teriyaki wings instead?\n\nOr oven pulled pork?\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/easy-oven-pulled-pork-recipe\n\nIs a 5-7 lb pork shoulder really only 8-12 servings? Even if it‚Äôs for sandwiches?\n\nThoughts on crisping it up a bit under the broiler like in [Kenji‚Äôs video](https://youtu.be/4u_bA6BcUH8)? That way I could cook it earlier in the day and then just crisp it up to reheat it right before heading to the park and keep it in a covered container to hopefully keep it warm? \n\nSausages?\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-italian-sausage-with-sweet-and-sour-peppers-and-onions-recipe\n\nNot sure how they would be after 1+ hours though, and I don‚Äôt want to have to leave the party to heat them up at home‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôve actually never made any of those recipes before, so just wondering how they might hold up. Other suggestions are welcome‚Ä¶ thanks!",

However, reading through the ingredients, I can't help but wonder how there's that much salt and sugar? 1 large head green cabbage, 1 large carrot and a large red onion combined with a full cup of sugar and half a cup of kosher salt?\n\nI live in Europe so I don't have kosher salt. I use table salt instead, and go by weight. According to Kenji's recipe I should add 144 grams of salt to my vegetables?! I know that the majority of salt is gonna be rinsed away, but still, I can't imagine how the final product isn't gonna be extremely salty with THAT much salt?",
