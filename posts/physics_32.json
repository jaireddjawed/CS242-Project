        "text": "I've been studying electricity (especially. AC/mains) and there seems to be a myth (?) that you can safely touch an arbitrarily high voltage power line as long as you don't also touch a lower potential object (i.e. \"ground\").\n\nI don't understand this unless it's meant to be an idealization. Why doesn't the current just travel through the human body as well as the hot wire, especially since the human body would be at a much lower potential than the wire?\n\nPeople like to give glib answers about needing to complete a circuit, but a human is certainly not a single point - we have trillions upon trillions of atoms touching the wire, even on a single hand.\n\nEven with the relatively high resistance of skin, wouldn't the high voltage just push AC waves back and forth through the body, which has now become part of the \"hot\" transmission wire?\n\nOn a related note, is this why the linemen need to bring themselves &amp; the helicopter up to potential with the conducting wand? Or is there a more advanced explanation around capacitors?\n\nNot sure if I'm communicating right, but it bothers me when people idealize everything as if currents can only flow on dedicated circuits or through the earth. What makes the earth any different from a human body when you're talking about 700K volts on the hot line(s)?",

        "text": "This is based on the belief that a particles positional certainty can be 0%. I give a brief summary on how this could make sense and what would happen as a result. \n\n\nA particles position and momentum can not be observed without counter-acting effects. The more precise we know the position of a particle, the less we know of its momentum and vice versa. The more certain we become about a particles momentum, the more uncertain its position is. This means a particle has the ability to exist anywhere in the universe based on its probability of position. This is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Particles in an uncertain state can also still be affected by an external force. If the particles position or momentum is uncertain, it can still be affected by external force without \"collapsing\" or being \"observed.\" I do not believe two different particles are entangled, rather it's the same particle physically existing in two places upon being in its particle state. Particles can also experience particle properties and \"wave\" properties non-simultaneously. This can be possible because of something called wave-particle duality. So if a particle were in its \"wave\" state, it really just means either its position or its momentum is uncertain. So if a particles positional probability is 0% certain, it means theres no probability that it can be in one precise spot. This can happen when a particles momentum is 100% certain. If it's positional certainty was 0%, it would not have an exact spot to go to when being observed or affected by external force that causes it to collapse and appearing in multiple places. This process would not require any travel of information or matter in general. Simply, if Particle A in one location hits another particle in which observes Particle A. Particle A in a completely different location is still affected because it's the same particle. This can also be known as Quantum Entanglement.",

Because the force on the ball from the string points towards the center of curvature, wouldn't this mean there would be a centrifugal force acting on the string away from the center of curvature? (As in the ball's force on the string)  \nObviously, the string has a net force towards the center of the circle - as - if we took any point on the string, the string follows a similar path as the ball.",

I guess this is the best subreddit to find the answer ( if not please refer me to somewhere else)\n\nI want to know the answer for a particular situation right now, but I'd also be interested in any resources for how different weather/terrain affects RF on both smaller and biggger scale.\n\nFurther detail on what I'm trying to figure out :\n\nI want to know what happens on the really small scale level in RF propagation. In particular HF skywaves ( in case you don't know, 3 to 30 MHz is HF).\n\nHigher frequencies more easily pass through the ionoized layer than lower does, and lower refracts more easily. I've recently learned that photons are the force carrier for EM &amp; electrons emit photons and can kind of bounce away from each other. I think that is going somewhere? But I'm not sure about after that. I think somehow electric fields are involved. I would assume if a layer is ionized then it would have a greater E field ?\n\nSo I think that as the RF waves get towards this layer the E field charge pushes the RF away? But also I heard that photons don't interact with E fields so I'm not sure what stops the RF.\n\nAnd then the 2nd part to this that i do not understand is : Why can higher frequencies shoot through energized gas layers, but lower can't? It's all photons, is there a certain property or equation in physics that would exlpain this? Are higher energy photons less likely to interact with electrons ( which would likely result in it being pushed back)?\n\nThank you",

        "text": "One topic in physics that is often overlooked but critical is the study of thermodynamics.\n\nThermodynamics is the physics branch that studies heat and its relationship to work and energy. It is a fundamental science that underlies many of the technologies we rely on daily, from the internal combustion engine in our cars to the refrigerators in our homes.\n\nOne of the critical principles of thermodynamics is the first law, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This means that in any energy conversion process, there will always be some waste energy that is lost to the environment.\n\nAnother important concept in thermodynamics is the second law, which states that the total entropy (a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system) will always increase in any energy conversion process. This means that energy conversions will always be less efficient over time and that it is impossible to create a perpetual motion machine that can operate indefinitely without any external energy input.\n\nThermodynamics has many practical applications, including the design of engines, refrigeration systems, and power plants. It is also essential for understanding the behavior of gases and how they expand and contract in response to changes in temperature and pressure.\n\nDespite its importance, thermodynamics is often a neglected topic in physics, with many students and laypeople finding it needs clarification and more abstract. However, understanding the principles of thermodynamics is crucial for anyone interested in the science behind the technologies that power our world.",

        "text": "A bunch of people on this reddit board don't understand some physics concepts. This explanation is for those who don't understand some physics concepts.\n\nPi (œÄ) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is an important mathematical concept that has numerous practical applications in fields such as geometry, engineering, and science.\n\nBlack holes are objects in space that are so massive and dense that they have a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. They are formed when a star collapses at the end of its life and its core becomes so dense that it creates a gravitational field so strong that it sucks in everything around it.\n\nGravity is a force that exists between any two objects with mass. It is the force that gives weight to physical objects and is what holds the planets in orbit around the sun. Gravity is caused by the mass of an object and is directly proportional to the mass of that object and inversely proportional to the distance between the objects.\n\nLight speed is the speed at which light travels through a vacuum. It is a constant value, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, and is the maximum speed at which information can be transmitted. It is also the speed at which massless particles, such as photons, travel.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify these concepts for those who don't understand them on this reddit board",

We know that conductors exert a force on each other due to the magnetic field generated due to current. Now in the case I mentioned above if we use integration to calculate the force on the smaller wire by considering an element we can arrive at a definite answer.\nIf for example the infinite wire is along X axis and the small wire along Y axis and current as (-√Æ) for I and (+j) for i, then the force direction exerted by the infinite wire on the small wire is (-√Æ)[ by RHT rule]. If we think of this force as an action then it must have an equal and opposite reaction however if the infinite wire has a force along(√Æ) then it will make the length element L and B antiparallel which will make the force nil.\nSo does Newton's 3rd law get violated?\n\nI'm sorry if I'm unable to explain very well but the question intrigued me so much I had to ask",

He measured a correlation between redshift and distance, and he at the time was cautious to interpret this redshift as expansion. I've linked a paper with the handful of independent tests of redshift equaling expansion, and their overall inconclusive nature. I've done this because many people here seem to be totally unaware how shaky the assumption that cosmological redshift equal expansion is: \n\n&gt; Nobody has ever directly observed a galaxy distance being increased with time. The\nmotion of the putative expansion of the Universe is so slow that it is unmeasurable.\nThe variation in the redshift of a galaxy is also very slow and difficult to measure.\nSandage [75] proposed in 1962 to measure the expected dz\ndt = (1 + z)H0 ‚àí H(z) (‚àº1\ncm/s/year), but it has not hitherto been possible to meassure such a low acceleration.\nIt would be possibly observable with a 40 m telescope over a period of ‚àº20 year using\n4000 h of observing time [76]. So, unfortunately, apart from the actual redshift of the\ngalaxies, there are at present no direct proofs of the expansion.
