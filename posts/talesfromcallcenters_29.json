For those of you that don't know when a debit card gets declined it isn't always on the bank end, it can be a merchant processing error as well. So here's a fun story for you.\nMe- thanks for calling bank my name is supetac3, how can I help you today?\nCustomer- you fucking faggot, you need to quit making me look like a broke ass n***** in front of all my friends.\nMe- sir I'm sorry you feel that way, what is going on?\nCustomer- you dumb ass faggot declined my fucking card.\nMe- which transactions are talking about sir?\nCustomer- it's the charge to store that you fucking declined.\nMe- sir I am showing that charge was approved and is pending on your account, sometimes there can be merchant errors that result in a decline as well.\nCustomer- fuck you and fuck bank, you guys need to quit dealing my fucking card.\nMe- again sir I apologize but bank did not decline your card, I can help you dispute the charge since they didn't give you your merchandise if you would like? \nCustomer- fuck you just fucking remove the charge. He then proceeds to hang up without doing a dispute or anything, some people man I swear",

My first phone job was in sales. We were inbound and I was making a ton of money for being only 18. \n\nI get this guy who wants to set up a family plan for his office in which he was a podiatrist. He wants as many lines as he can get credit for and all sorts of things. I'm super excited of course because $$$. We spend over and hour talking in detail about each line he keeps mentioning each of his secretaries shoe size but I thought he was just eccentric. \n\nWe are wrapping things up and he asks me my shoe size. Kinda odd but whatever. We are at the check out after I have told him about my shoe size and socks I'm starting to get a little weirded out but this is a big sale for me so I keep on going. \n\nHe gives me his card number but it's missing about 4 digits. Things have been pretty light hearted so far so I jokingly ask where the rest of his card info is and he says. \"I'm sure I can find the numbers if you let those feet breath a little.\" He then starts telling me he is publishing a book for his practice and wants me to send him pics of my feet and in return he will tell me the rest of his card info. He goes into total creep mode quickly and hangs up as soon as I start to protest. \n\nHe called in thousands of times. It was a running joke at this point. I spoke to him so many times as soon as I started talking he would say he wanted to talk to a new rep and he was sick of my size 8 adidas and wanted someone with dress shoes! He knew everyone's size and shoes at this point. Somehow one day he finally got a cease and desist letter and just stopped.\n\nNow I'm all creeped out all over again. Let me know if you want more. I have plenty not the best writer I know. ",

The big box store card has a rewards feature that pays out the cardholder/member once each year (in the form of a check), generally in February. Well, alas, it's February, and I get a call from one of the cardholders/members who has received their rewards check in the mail.\n\nMe: Thanks for calling credit services, how may I help you today?\n\nCardholder: I got my rewards check in the mail, and it says payable to [Big Box Store]. Why does it say that?\nMe: Well, sir, the reason it says \"payable to [Big Box Store]\" is because you have to redeem the check at [Big Box Store]. It's always been that way.\n\n(Now, the cardholders/members always get something with their checks that explains how to redeem the check and gives further instructions. On that paper, it states that YES, they have to redeem it at [Big Box Store] and that NO, they cannot redeem it at a bank or online at [BigBoxStore.com]. Of course, there are those that neglect to read this, including the guy calling in.)\n\nCardholder: I can't redeem it at my bank?\n\nMe: Unfortunately no, you would have to redeem it at [Big Box Store]. You would not be able to redeem it at your bank.\n\nCardholder: Can you apply it towards my credit card?\n\nMe: Yes, but the way to do that, you would still have to redeem it at [Big Box Store] and then have it go towards your credit account then.\n\nCardholder: But the nearest [Big Box Store] is 50 miles away.\n\n(I'm thinking, \"Then why the hell would you become a member if the nearest location is 50 MILES AWAY?\")\n\nMe: I'm terribly sorry, sir.\n\nCardholder: After I redeem this check I'm going to call again and close this account.

        "text": "Another story from my days working in the Billing department of an independent MMO studio in Cambridge, UK.\n\nOur system was fairly good at allowing us to track down customers' payments. As I've alluded to before, not all payments were authorised but, usually, with the last 6 digits of a credit card (our system hid the rest for privacy and security), an email address or the actual game account name, we could usually help out. No idea if they're still using the same system now mind.\n\nAnyway, if you made credit card payments they would appear on your statement similar to the follow:\n\n&gt; R__scape by Ja___x.com monthly membership        $5.00\n\nNow, two things are critical there. The game's name and the company's name.\n\nOne day I received an email from a lady asking us to stop all further payments because her son was wasting far too much on the game with his friends and he should be concentrating on school. Unfortunately, there was no account registered with this lady's email address. So I respond asking for some other details, does she know the name of her son's account or perhaps his email address. A day goes by, the trouble with dealing with people in different time zones it can take a while to deal with folk, and she doesn't know those details but really wants me to stop the payments. So I fall back to the last resort (so or I thought) of the 6 digits from her card. Instead she sent me all the card details, over email, with scant regard for security (oops).\n\nBUT as it would happen, I can still not locate any payments on our system. I respond as such, ask if there's a second card on the account, or if not could she send a scanned copy of the credit card statement so we can verify the charges - if we then saw them it would be up to IT/sysadmin to sort it.\nThe reply comes back, she's livid now. She wants me to return all of the money, that we've 'stolen', due to the stress of just getting a simple payment stopped - but she did include a scan of the credit card statement.\n\nUpon which were:\n&gt; Wor__ __ ___craft by Blizzard.com monthly membership        $9.99\n(or whatever the payment showed up on the statement, basically it clearly wasn't to our company)\n\nIn fact there were loads of these payments. Looks like little Jonny had signed up himself and all his friends rather than doing his homework.\n\nSo I have to let the lady know, we can't refund the payments, we can't stop the payments. Because those payments go to A. COMPLETELY. SEPARATE. COMPANY. But not in those words, obviously, professional hat on at all times kids.\n\nWorse, she still came back demanding that WE get THEM to return her money. Instead I sent her a final reply with a link to Blizzard's customer service and informed her that we can't assist any further.\n\nWonder if she ever did get her money back.",

To this day she was still one of the most pleasant people I have ever dealt with.\n\nL will be lady, M is me.\n\nM: hello, is [lady] available?\n\nL: this is her.\n\nM: this is squidbaitjr with [company], [collections disclosure].  I'm giving you a call today because it seems your [store] card has fallen behind and I wanted to see if we could make a payment to bring it current today.\n\nL: umm okay, I was pretty sure I paid that off almost 6 months ago.  What is the balance on the card?\n\nM: well ma'am we can take a look at the account together to figure out what may have happened.  The current balance is $6,xxx but minimum due is $1xx to bring it current.\n\nL: I don't think so, there must be a mistake or someone has been charging my car because there is no way I spent that much on this card.\n\nM: I would be happy to go over the charges with you to see what has been charged to the account and if we find that the charges are indeed fraudulent, we can get in touch with our fraud department who will take the proper steps to fix this.\n\nL:  okay thank you for your help.  I can't believe there is that much on the account.  \n\nM: that's what I'm here for, not all collectors are terrible people.  Do you mind if I put you on a brief hold?  I'm actually having a little bit of trouble locating the most recent charges.\n\nL: please take you time, I appreciate you looking into this.\n\nSo to start, having a friendly tone in collection is like the most amazing thing ever along with being thanked and acknowledged.  People underestimate the power of kindness.\n\nI look over the account and there hadn't been a charge on the account for 6 months.  Her original balance that she had remains was about $2xx, nothing big at all.  She had attempted to make a payment but the check had been returned.  There was a returned check fee, then late fees, interest and in that time a deferred interest promotion ended (which would have been paid off if not for the returned check) added a few thousand dollars)\n\n*gets back on the line*\n\nM: well ma'am, I have good news and bad news.  Good news, the charges are not fraudulent.  The bad news is [explains the situation].\n\nL:  I can't believe I didn't see that notice.  I got a letter from you but I figured it was just a payment confirmation and forgot to open it.  I'm so sorry about that.  My god that really sucks!  I know I'm the one that dropped the ball, but do you think there is anyway to remove a late fee or anything that may help lower the balance since it was such a slight mishap?\n\nSo now this lady has admitted fault, been very pleasant, and respectful.  That put me in a great mood after a shift of shitty calls.\n\nM:  I know I already put you on hold once but if I may out you on a brief hold again I can see what I can do to help you out.\n\nL:  yes, thank you so much for checking.\n\nI went to my direct supervisor and told him about the situation.  We both thought it was BS that she racked up over $5000 in fees and interest because she tried to pay it off.  He gave me special permissions to take care of her as long as she paid off the original remaining balance.\n\nM: okay ma'am I'm going to have to got back on hold for a second but I need to know if you would mind making a payment today for the original $2xx that you tried to pay 6 months ago.\n\nL: that's no problem at all.  Let me get my check book.\n\nM: okay, while you find that I will see what fees I am able to remove.  Thank you for working with me on all of this.\n\n*puts on hold, does some stuff, gets back on the line*\n\nM: okay, I'm back.  Since you are taking care of that payment today I went ahead and removed all of the other fees, interest and charges so once you make this payment you're all paid off.\n\nL: *in a shocked tone*  are you fucking with me?  Thank you so much!  \n\nM: not a problem, you have been one of the nicest callers I have had and I want to let you know how much we appreciate that in this line of work.\n\nI finished up the call after that.\n\nSo next time you get a call from a collector, be nice and own up to a mistake you made whether it's not paying attention or paying it off because it could play up to be in your favor.\n\n",

        "text": "So, as many of you probably know, many american companies outsource their customer service departments to third parties. I'm located in the Dominican Republic (in the Caribbean), and I work for a US company that specializes on that. This story was about 3 months ago, when I worked in a chat sales support project for a large furniture/appliances retailer (I was assigned to a newspaper recently), so I'd get lots of calls of people with home problems, even though I was technically supposed to only focus on sales. Also, since it was a while ago, I don't remember all the details \n\nOne day, like half an hour before ending my shift, I got this really nice customer who first asked me about how to use the self-cleaning function in her oven. She was really nice, which was unusual for the customers I received, then proceeded to ask me about an issue with her microwave (I don't remember exactly). At some point, the conversation got a little shifted and she told me that she was a single mother with two kids and a cat living in a small apartment, and that she had a special kind of OCD that made small everyday tasks really hard for her, so she needed medication, but she hadn't been able to buy it recently because of economic problems. She was so nice I didn't even try to sell her anything, even though it'd affect my numbers.\n\nWhile she was asking me something about her refrigerator, she happened to ask me where I was located. I replied the usual ~~lie,~~ saying that I was in Miami, FL (they actually told everyone to reply this during the training). \"Sweet! I'll be there around next week or so, do you think we could meet?\"\n\n_mierda_\n\nI don't remember a lot of what happened next. I remember that I made up something along the lines of \"I have a busy schedule\" or \"I have to visit someone\". However, I remember pretty well the bittersweet feeling I felt when I had to tell this sweet but hardworking bean that I was 2000 km away from her without telling her I was 2000 km (and a deadly sea of despair) away from her.\n\nShe said she would chat with me again sometime, but there are over 30 agents online at any given moment, so.... :c \n\nIt makes me happy and sad at the same time to think about it. I really hope she's doing well, though, and that her appliances are behaving as they should.",

Just do you damn job and figure it out.\n\nM:  well ma'am, if it helps you understand the bill better, I will have my coworkers son write it in crayon for you since it seems like that may be more on your level of understanding.  \n\nL: excuse me?\n\nM: I said I can send you a bill that will be formatted differently and easier to understand.\n\nL okay, you better send that out or you guys just won't get your money.\n\nI sent her a duplicate bill alright, this time however, it was in Braille.\n\nVery glad that call didn't get pulled.",

        "text": "First post here.  This one wasn't my call but I was fortunate/unfortunate enough to Y-jack on the call.\n\nI was in collections for credit cards a while back.  We usually had interesting calls but we always were polite and professional in our practices.  However, everyone had their day but we would pull it back together.\n\nWe were always advised to help the customer find a solution and offer a few methods to the customer to get money together if they didn't have the money to make a payment and bring their account current.\n\nNormally while Y-Jacking, if something went awry, I would take over the call to ease tension and find solutions.  I didn't dare touch this one, mainly because I was speechless and probably couldn't have talked anyway.\n\nR will be rep, C for customer.\n\n\nR: Hello, I'm looking to speak with [C name].\n\nC: This is him.\n\nR: [collections opening] and I see you're behind on you payments.  I called to see if you were able to make a payment to bring your account current.\n\nC: I'm sorry but I am not able to at the moment.  Unfortunately we're on a tight budget right now and all of our bills have been suffering.\n\nWe heard this one all the time.  Some generic response and that they couldn't make a payment but we were trained to ask what was going on so we could evaluate the situation and try to find a solution.  After a while you are able to determine who is full of shit and who is genuinely having trouble.\n\nR: Do you mind me asking what's causing the limited budget?  Maybe we could find a payment plan that could help you out.\n\nC: My son was diagnosed with cancer 4 months ago and the medical bills are through the roof.  We've had to sell a lot of our belongings just to keep his treatment going because I'm not pulling enough in through work.\n\nR: I'm sorry to hear about your son.  I could imagine that would be a difficult situation.  Let me ask, would there be any family or friends that may be able to loan you a little money that way we could at least bring the account current and avoid it being charged off?\n\nOnce an account reached a certain age of delinquency, the account was sold to a third party collection agency instead of in house collections trying to recover.\n\nC: No, my wife quit her job to stay home and take care of our son and to be honest this card isn't my first priority.\n\nI can respect that but the rep didn't want to give up.\n\nR:  I can understand that you have more important matters to attend to but by neglecting you financial obligation to this card, it will only cause more of a headache for you down the road....\n\n(We never tell the customer about effects on credit or anything related to credit.  We didn't work for the credit bureau so it wasn't our job.)\n\nR: ...I would just hate to see it effect your credit once it has been charged off.  Do you think you would be able to defer a utility bill so we're could work out a payment plan?\n\nABORT!  ABORT!\n\nC: sir, I have already made my own arrangements with [utility companies] and as I said before, this card is just going to have to be neglected for the time being until something changes financially and we get caught up on my son's medical bills.  He comes before this card.\n\nR: I can understand that you son takes priority. Im just trying to help find a solution to pull in extra money...(customer cuts off rep)\n\nC:  you obviously don't understand because you keep pushing and now you're pissing me off.\n\nPrepare shit to hit the fan in 3... 2... 1...\n\nR: *in a bit of an aggravated tone*  I'm sorry sir but have you considered having a garage sale to sell the toys you won't be needing soon?  That may help raise the money.\n\nMy jaw dropped, I unplugged and walked away.  I didn't hear the rest of it, I didn't want to hear the rest of it and I sure as hell wasn't going to be a part of that.  We had an amazing QA department and needless to say is that rep was not there for much longer.\n",

        "text": "I work for a large cable company that does not have a very big Spanish costumer service. So when they call they most of the time get English speaking representative. The call over flow into regular CS.  Longer I work for this company more annoyed Spanish people I come in contact with who don't like the option of having a translator on the line. I fully understand but there nothing I can do. Now 4 months in to this job I'm still not very confident in everything I do. Most customer appreciate my help I get the few that look for the non confident representative and take advantage of it. Spanish lady calls in wants someone who speak her language. I try the Spanish line get a regular rep. They tx me I hear someone pick up and then drop the call. I try again but then just explain that she would have to talk to me or call back in later. SL(Spanish lady) and M is for me.\n   \nM:\" mam I'm not going to be able to get a hold of someone in spanish. If I tx you you'll just get another English speaking rep.\" \n\nSL: \"Okay my English isn't great but I'll will speak to an English speaking rep.\" I become quiet and confused. I don't know if I worded it wrong or what..\n\nM: \"Mam I am that Eng speaking rep.\" at this time I tried the phone number she gave me that pulled her account up. It did. I said \"SL I would be happy to answer any questions \" I ask for her pin number.\n\nSL: \"You going uh, eh, hm, doesn't made you sound like a very good CS.\" Goes on about how we bought them from a Fios company how better there CS was. At this time I honestly don't remember doing any of that in this call. \n\nSL \"I'm going to pay $27 by check and that is all I'm paying you. I never made any changes to my services\". Previous bill for some reason has two phone lines. Before I could even try to look over the bills I hear this \"mam what are you doing\"?\n \nM: \"I'm an looking over your bills and seeing what has happen. So bear with me I'll see if there anything I need straighten out.\"\n\nSL: \"(Repeat I'm only going to pay so and so amount then become condescending) I could be a csr. I could make people feel comfortable and help people.(last time I check I speak with a nice soft helpful tone) I'm disabled and it wouldn't  be a hard job.   Do you have any way I could speak to some one about a job.\"\n\nM: \"(I should have taken more control over the call but I was just flustered) This is a very good company to work for(not). Um I see you live in Clearwater we have costumer service center in Florida. I know in Deland.\" \n\nSL \"I'm on fix income, I have no car,  do you have a phone number I can speak to some one.\"\n\nM: \"(I officially had enough of her) No mam I don't have a phone number for you to call. Please just pay that amount\". I didn't close, I said bye and hit the release.\n\nLast call of the day another Spanish lady. I get a translator antonio from language lines. She called in about paying bills that she is behind on that she wanted to set something up to help pay them. She was in the hospital for a period of time.\n\nM: \"Before I tx you can have a account number and call back #\"\n\nSL give me these number that don't resemble an account number in any way. Interpretor step in say I believe there is more going on she talking about having multiple bills.\n\nM: \"You have a bill with (company name) on it? A phone, internet or cable bill?\" this somehow confuses her more. \n\nSL: \"All my utility bills are in my son's name I have a Sprint phone. Why are you asking me these question this is about hospital bills. \n\nI realizing she still doesn't understand that she gotten a hold of the wrong company I nicely explain who I was again and why I ask for that information that I would happily assist getting her the correct phone number to talk to hospital ask what hospital it was. \nShe explain it UT Medical Center. I ask what state she say TN. I know where she talking about. I'm asking what number she call. She explain she call the number on the paper and got a hold of someone who she thought was txing her to a Spanish line. I find billing and patient account phone number and give it to her. She goes on her way. \nAntonio the Interpretor was very surprised I would be nice enough to figure out what hospital and give her another phone number to try. It just in my nature. \n",

        "text": "I love this call, it warms my heart.\n\nSo once again i work for an airline, and at one point in time...ticketing. So the way it works is you charge the card, once the bank authorizes the charge the airline issues your ticket. Simple enough. Because of the authorization required the status can pend for a few hours if the bank or your CC doesn't instantly push through your charges, this is completely unrelated to the airline i.e.: I've found that big spenders with amex cards seem to ticket almost instantly but that's neither here or there. So anyways..\n\nOften times passengers call in angry and upset that they haven't received an email, but their bank hasn't approved their charge so of course we haven't issued their ticket lol. So of course when it's that simple you know we are dealing with a complete logic meltdown when explaining this to passengers. ME- M LADY- L\n\n*ring ring ring*\nM- hello this is Pain how may I assist?\nL- I haven't recieved an email!\nM- ok no problem let me ask how long has it been since you booked a ticket with us?\nL- LAST MONTH\n\n(this is fairly typical. someone charges their card and then hedges their bets that everything at the time of booking went off without a hitch)\n\nM- *pulls up account* ok...great news it appears that your reservation was completed and ticketed, we sent an email out to you that day, I see that you called in again and we sent another out to you...I'm sorry about that, is your email still ____?\n\n(to my fault I have a problem giving obvious information as to not belittle them and I don't read a script so I try to ASSUME that they have already went through the motions of making sure the email on their reservation is correct and that they have checked their spam/junk folder)\n\nSo at any rate it doesn't matter. With the confirmation code you can just pull up your ticket on the app or our website and Re-email it to yourself since there's something lost in translation between sending the email and you receiving it, we literally give you the option to send it to yourself on a different system so there's an extremely small chance that you wouldn't get the email..since you're the one doing it here, and then this happens:\n\nMe- ok, well let me give you the confirmation code so you can jot it down, I'll go ahead and send you another email however should you not receive it, no worries you can access the reservation with the confirmation code I provide!\nL- NO I WANT THE EMAIL WHY CANT YOU SEND THE EMAIL?\nM- sure I can send another I was just on the side of caution I wouldn't want you to continue to not get that email, so you have the option of pulling the trip up on our site as a last resort\nL- THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I HAVE CALLED IN ABOUT AN EMAIL WHATS THE PROBLEM????\nM- there's no problem at all, ma'am would you like me to navigate you through the website so I can walk you through resend the email?\nL- SO NOW I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF? THIS IS RIDICULOUS WHAT DO YOU ET PAID TO DO? IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE I CAN SPEAK TO ABOUT THIS?\nM- **transfers call to help desk...in Spanish**\n\nOops",

On the computers we use to work, almost all websites are blocked, except the select few we need to work; which means that during the time I had no phone (until recently) I had to find other means of communicating with loved ones.\n\nFor moderately obvious reasons, \\*.google.com/\\* is whitelisted for all computers; and I saw that as an opportunity to use hangouts.google.com as a chat service of choice. Now that I have a phone, I've stuck with it, but that's not the point.\n\nToday, to save megabytes on my mobile data subscription, I was logged in to Hangouts on the work computer, as well as chatting with a customer, both intellectually demanding tasks. At a certain moment, some wires got crossed inside of my mind, or something, and I ended up sending the following message to my customer:\n\n&gt;Is there anything else I can do for you, darling?\n\n, to which the reply was\n\n&gt;Not now, but have a nice day, sweetheart ;-)\n\n(Yes, with the nose)\n\nSo, this story could probably have ended a little worse than it actually did, but I really got a couple laughs off it, and I really hope the person at the other end of the line did as well.",

I don't know if this is just my call center but it seems like certain customers will go into these inescapable logic loops whenever you give them an answer they don't want.\n\n\"because of legal restrictions customers aren't allowed to install life saving devices like smoke detectors or CO3 detectors on their own, it has to be a licensed tech\"\n\n\"alright, but I just want you to explain this to me, I've been your customer for years now, I always pay my bill, this is a problem with your smoke detector\" (the detector expired) \"why can't you just ship me a new one so I can install it myself instead of paying for some guy to do it for me?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry sir, but I physically do not have the option to ship you the smoke detector, a technician HAS to bring it in, I can lower the price on the tech to only $35 but keep in mind it costs us $300 to send the tech and we cover most of that for you.\"\n\n\"I get what you're saying, but I still don't understand why I can't just install this myself, I shouldn't have to have one of your techs come to my house just to install a smoke detector, just ship it to me and I can do it!\"\n\n\"Sir like I said before, I literally cannot ship you a new smoke detector, it isn't on my system. I can only schedule a tech to come and install a new one for you, because it counts as a life saving device it is required by law to be installed by a licensed technician. The best I can do for the tech fee is $35, there is no way for me to lower it more\"\n\n\"ok sure, but one more thing, I've been with you guys for years now! I'm a paying customer! Why won't you just send me the new smoke detector so I can install it!\"",

        "text": "I want to go ahead and share my very first call in a call center, I was 19 at the time, and it was 2001. Long distance phone carriers were still a big thing, and so were 10-10-XXX numbers that ran through them(offering \"lowered\" rates)  \n\nOur company had a simple policy about calls on the bill, customers didn't recognize, or claimed not to be valid calls. We would call the number, try to identify it, and check the history. If it didn't come up before or after, and nobody knew who it was, we could credit the call cost back to the customer.\n\nNow my very first call out of training, was a woman, she sounded very polite, but very angry about a $4.40 call(at $.10 per minute), that showed up on her phone bill. She had called to ask about the charge and see if we could remove it. Now being a little nervous, I was happy to help, but a bit slow on being able to, and she was ok with this. \n\nThe call was going great, until I put her on hold and I dialed the number to test it, and I'm greeted with the greatest thing ever. It was an adult phone line, disguised as a long distance number, instead of a 1-900 number. Now it was possible that it was still an error, so I start checking previous bills, and come across this number, once a month, on Wednesday nights, for almost a year. \n\nPanic sets in, as I realize I have to tell this woman that I can't credit the call, and WHY, along with what the number is. \n\nMe - Your very introverted newbie\nCustomer - Borderline angry caller\nCSHubs - The husband of the borderline angry caller\n\n&gt;Me- \"Ma'am I do apologize, but unfortunately this number belongs to an adult phone line, and I do see there is a history of it being called. For those reasons I will be unable to remove this charge. Is it possible there is someone else in the home who could have been making these calls?\n\n&gt;Customer - \"NO! NO! Absolutely not! There is nobody in this house except myself and my husband, and I'm not even home on Wednesday nights!\n\nAt that point I could almost hear the click in her mind, as she pulls the phone away from her mouth and begins to scream at her husband. This man is being verbally ripped from limb to limb. My trainer is able to hear this from 2 seats over, and slides down and jacks into my phone to listen. As he hears the verbal abuse to turn me, he lets me know I can warn them, and hang up at any time. Of course I'm now WAY to entertained by this to hang up!\n\n&gt;CSHub - \"You SoB, why would you lie to my wife and tell her I made those calls! I would never do something so dirty, you lying MF'ER!\"\n\n&gt;CS - \"Oh shut up you ^&amp;#$!, even he knows you are lying! We are done!\"\n\nAt this point the line goes dead as they clearly hung up. My trainer lets me know I'm welcome to step outside and have a smoke if I need it, and I badly did. And this, was my introduction to customer service, and call centers. I'd say it got me pretty ready for the next few years of work. ",

We only need about $40 more!\"(It was around 460 after tax.)\n\nMW: \"Ok! Add these two toilets! I think they're 300 each! That should put me at $499, right?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, uh...\"\n\nMW: \"Great!\"\n\nShe then proceeded to place her order, and go on her merry way.

Also I'm annoying.\n\nSo I work in a 24-hour finances help center at a University. I work a late shift, I have to take the Information and Student Services calls too (something I have \"opinions\" about but that's for another time)\n\nToday, I get a call on the Information line and I answered like I normally do, all chipper and shit, and this guy on the other line is mumbling something. I pause and give the \"Hello?\", so he helpfully mumbles a bit louder. And after that started, he didn't stop for five straight minutes. He sounded drunk or just some kinda disoriented. Here's what I managed to understand: (-- = mumblegrumble)\n\n\"I called earlier -- transferred to [nearby city] -- police -- I was a lawyer --conspiracy -- connecting to police --\n\n\"Sir, do you need to be connected to [Local PD?]?\"\n\n\"I dont -- just want to let someone know -- think there might be danger -- this conspiracy -- I was a lawyer for 10 years...\"\n\n\"Okay, is this an emergency?\"\n\n[a mumbled sentence in which I caught the word \"not\"]\n\n\"Right. Just a moment while I get you over to someone.\"\n\nSo here is where you all might be mad at me. I didn't transfer to the police right away. I went and asked my supervisor. Because viewing his cases in our system while he was mumbling incessantly, I saw that he had called a couple times in the last couple hours. He'd already been transferred to police. And I figured that whatever issue he was having that he had time to talk about for ten minutes, he had time to wait one extra minute while I asked my supervisor if I should waste the police's time with this. Just as I went back to transfer him (supervisor gave the go-ahead) he hung up. \n\nTurns out he had called in earlier and spoken to someone else. He was wandering around [nearby city] and got lost? Or something. He wasn't in his right mind. And my coworker had already transferred him to the police across the state. \n\nSo I start snooping into his older cases because I am a snoop and I admit it proudly; turns out he was a student three years ago... and had *died* three years ago. I told my coworker, who was like \"Ohhh *that's* why he kept saying he wasn't dead!\"\n\nMaybe we shoulda been weirded out but idk I love morbid crap. So I'm all excited like maybe the reason I couldn't understand him was because his cell service sucked from Heaven. Maybe he wanted to get his degree from beyond the grave. MAYBE the University had a deal with God that the dude couldn't die until his tuition was accounted for. How could we know?! We have a no scented stuff rule but maaaybe if it's to converse with the dead, they'll allow it. I mean hey that would be next-level customer service-- we will help you past the grave. But that was just me being a bright-eyed 21-year-old girl turning to dreams to avoid her student-debt-and-failed-diet ridden life.\n\nI could leave the story there because it would be much cooler than the actual ending, but I'm not a liarmouth soooo turns out some other dude had the same name who *had* died three years ago. So... kinda lame. But it's fine, nobody was laughing at my ghost jokes anyway.\n\nOh. And boy do I have a story for the next damn person who asks me why I hate Information calls.\n\n",

The other day a guy called in screaming and swearing at me because the bank had holds on his deposits. After spending fifteen minutes repeating the same explanations over and over again, and him not listening at all, and constantly swearing at me I finally told him to stop or I'll hang up, which we can do. He demanded my supervisor (they don't bother to take calls, we have a whole different department for that).\n\nI accidentally screwed up the transfer and disconnected. No idea how that happened.\n\nBut then I had a thought that's been bugging me since yesterday. Why? Why would he demand to speak to my supervisor. How could he possibly spin this so that I'm the bad guy here? What could he possibly say to put me in the wrong? What could he possibly hope to accomplish?",

Sometimes people make honest mistakes and use a shortened name ie: (Steven - Steve) when they book tickets, that's not a problem. Correct it, send them on their way.\n\n\n\nWell this day I get a customer that claims she needs to sort out her ticket.

How does your name appear on your travel documents I'll be glad to add that for you to avoid being jammed up at the airport!\n\nL- I DONT HAVE A MIDDLE NAME\n\nM- Sure. Well, that's not uncommon at all, many customers travel who only hold a surname and given name. A middle name isn't necessary if you don't actually have one!\n\nL- BUT MY MIDDLE NAME WONT BE ON THE TICKET AND I NEED A FULL NAME SO I DONT GET CAUGHT IN CUSTOMS!\n\nM- Absolutely.

        "text": "Hey guys, this one is one of my favorite stories of my time in the call center world. It happened when I was just a young padawan, just out of training. I have a fairly unique southern drawl, being from Tennessee, and often find myself becoming the amusement of many of my \"northern\" customers. \n\nOne day, I had a nice gentleman from New York call in. \n\n\"Gooood Mornin' and thank you for calling ****, my name is Pierogi Tuxedo, with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking today?\"\n\nThere was a slight laugh on the other end of the line, and the customer, who I'll name Benny from the Bronx, began to speak. \n\nBB: Wow, they really hire \"locally\" don't they?! Where'd they find you at?\n\nMe: (chuckles) I'm from Tennessee, sir. How can I help you today?\n\nBB: Well, Jethro, why don't you start up that thar computer and tell me about your prices on hot tubs.\n\nThere's very little I get offended by anymore, but one of them is when customers don't allow me to be professional at my job. Still, I pressed onward. Then, my Customer Portal took a dump.\n\nBB: What's taking so long, Cletus? \n\nMe: Just having slight technical issues, sir. Give me just a moment.\n\nBB: (Sigh) I get the one damn rep who can't read...Christ..\n\nMe: (Tensely)...Let me put you on a brief hold....sir...and I'll get this working in just a moment.\n\nI had already gotten my system working again. This was a penalty hold, because truly, the South was about to rise again in my bloodstream, and my supervisor had looked over to see if I was alright. With a nod, I let him know I was fine, took a deep breath, and went back to face Benny Bronx.\n\nMe: Thank you for holdin-\n\nBB: You get it figured out, Billy Bob? Or do I need to find me another bumpkin?\n\nThat's it.\n\nMe: \"Sir, I have every intention of helping you today, but you must allow me to do my job, and to find the product you would like. \n\nI took a breath, and let him have it.\n\n\"You see, I have an AR-500 5-Person Spa with 19 Jets in Stainless Steel and Easy Plug-N-Play and LED Waterfall in Graystone that suits the budget that you had mentioned to my colleague you had spoken with prior to today, per the notes in the order. It seems you had had some real issues with your previous order, it is therefore that I will be honoring the 10% discount he had allocated to your reorder, which will bring your total today to $2,374.93. I have your credit card saved in your account for added convenience which popped up with your registered account. All I will need is your three digit security code on the back of the card, are you ready...SIR?!\"\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by the following:\n\nBB: This better be the best ***** hot tub in New York, or its on you.\n\nHe gave me his info, I placed the order, and he went to my survey. In the voice comments, he relented:\n\n\"Best customer service I've experienced in a long time, will shop here more often because of my experience with your sales rep, PierogiTuxedo. He really knows his stuff. He's got a great sense of humor, too.\"\n\n\n",

What seems to be the problem?\n\nMrs Post Office: It doesn't work.\n\nMe: Is the equipment not turning on?

The phone is not working, Mr X is old and he can't live without his phone. You must send a tech team to fix it straight away.\n\nMe: Mrs Post Office, we would really like to help, but in order to do so, we need someone who's near the equipment to call us. The issue could be with the SIM card, could be the equipment, could be a number of things. I can see Mr X has a cell phone, he can call us from there or we can schedule a time to call him in order to do a few simple tests so we can get to the root of this issue.\n\nMrs Post Office: You people just want your money and do nothing to help and you're a stupid little bitch! What kind of tests do you guys need to do?\n\nMe: First of all we need to know if the phone is on [[most of the time the issue is just the phone being turned off]], we also need to know if there is any message on the screen, if they hear any recording while trying to make a call -\n\nMrs Post Office: I TOLD YOU THE PHONE'S NOT WORKING. I NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SENDING YOUR TECH TEAM.\n\nMe: Mrs Post Office, we do not send tech teams for these issues, our phones are satellite, if the phone's not working they can acquire a new one with us -\n\nMrs Post Office: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GUYS DON'T SEND TECH TEAMS? WHAT DO YOU GUYS EVEN DO???\n\nMe [[pausing, giving her time to end rant]]: We really need Mr X to call us from his cell phone, or give us a schedule so we can contact him in order to understand what the issue is.\n\n...ad eternum for 20 goddamn minutes, until she got tired and hung up on me.",

That isn't right first of all you placed my order wrong.\n\nEver noticed when someone is mad even if you didn't do it they always say you like you were the person that done it?\n\nTL: Well here is what's going to happen I'm gonna refuse the package and if I don't get my refund on the same day...I will file a report to the BBB\n\n\"You know that it takes more then just one day...nevermind\" \n \nMe: Yes Ma'am I understand that just to let you know it will take 5-7 Days when we get the product back for us to refund it.\n\nTL: Yea if I don't get it! I will report you to the BBB!\n\nR: So Basically you called to let me know what you gonna do?\n\nTL: Correct I don't want any resolution I'm reporting your website for harassment and if i don't get a refund I will report you to the BBB. I know you have a policy but I will report you cause this is  unfair.\n\nR: .......I'm sorry ma'am I will bring this up to my management team to let them know is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nTL: ...NO...fix your site you will lose customers that way good bye! \n\nOkay so that was my call makes me wonder cause I would had reshipped her the right product no problem and refunded her anyway.

For the last 8 months I have been working at a very large IT call centre in the UK that has service desks for multiple large brands. I happen to work on the worst of the bunch which provides hardware and IT support for a certain global fried chicken joint, and to put it bluntly it's a bit of a shit storm sometimes. \n\nThe way it works is the stores all round the UK call us whenever something breaks or goes wrong in the store and we will either try to diagnose it or if it can't be done it will be replaced by one of our engineers. Now without sounding racist the company employs a lot of people who haven't been in the country long enough to speak English very well so sometimes quick fixes turn into long fixes because neither of us can really tell what's being said by either party.\n\nSo I'm in the office doing my thing and contemplating jumping out the window when the phone rings, we'll call this guy dopey dude and me as in me.\n\nMe: Service desk, GiveMeYourUpvotesPlz speaking how can I help?\n\nDD: Yes I am calling from store **** and you know my ugh, back of the office machine is not working.\n\nMe: Okay can you tell me specifically what machine is not working as there are multiple devices?\n\nDD: yes okay it is the back of the house machine\n\nMe: ...which one though?\n\nDD: But you see how do you mean which one? The back of the house machine is not working.\n\nMe: Yes but as I said there are multiple devices in your back office, can you tell me which one, plus you haven't even told me what exactly is not working with it? \n\nDD: IT IS NOT WORKING SIR\n\nMe: Yes, as I said, what is not working and how is it not working?\n\nDD: *Proceeds to speak in foreign language*\n\nMe: I'm sorry?\n\nDD: *Speaks to me in the same language again*\n\nMe: I'm sorry I don't understand what you are saying.\n\nDD: You don't speak language?\n\nMe: Not the one you're speaking no\n\nOh my god all hell broke loose after that sentence \n\nDD: GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!\n\nMe: Gladly\n\n\nIn the end it turned out all the issue was that his network cable was not inserted into the printer properly and was not printing as a result...\n\nThis is why I hate my job.",

My name is SkepticalLady. Your website is giving me some incredible problems, and its not the first time this has happened. Y'know, you really should work on your website.\"\n\nMe: \"Well I'm so sorry you were having some issues; If you'd like, I'd be more than happy to help you place the order!\"\n\nSL: \"Oh! That would be wonderful!\"\n\nSo in my system, if a customer has a previous order or a cart they have made via the website, we can retrieve it by using their email or phone number. I ask Skeptical Lady for her email which she gladly gives, pull up her REGISTERED account, verify information, and see she has her credit card saved into our system! Easy peasy order, right? Nope.\n\nMe: \"OK! I've got everything pulled up for you, ma'am. I see you've got your card all saved in here and ready to go! If I could just have the security code on your card, we'll be all set!\" \n\nSL: (Long Pause) \"I...beg your pardon? My security code?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes ma'am, on your card, thats usually located to the right of the signature so we can process the transaction!\"\n\nSL: \"I don't feel comfortable giving the information. How do I know you're really from *****?\"\n\nAt this point, I'm a little taken aback.. Keep in mind, she called us, on our VERY public number, and before I had even stated my name, I said the name of the company. \n\nMe: \"Well, if you'd like, you can absolutely speak with my supervisor to verify who I am!\"\n\nSL: \"Ok, I'll wait!\"\n\nSo she did, meanwhile, my supervisor and teammates have overheard my conversation and are laughing because of the absurdity of the whole matter. My supervisor gets on the headset and speaks with the lady, who it is found out that she is using her IPad to place the order through her web browser, and that was what was causing the problem. After explaining to my supervisor that she didn't believe him either, she hung up.\n\nI've decided to embark on a quest to discover who I am, because apparently, I've been mistaken.\n\nThanks for reading!",

One day, around a month ago, there was this customer, who was looking to purchase a barbecue. Everything was running smoothly, and I was already savoring the sweet taste of a complete transaction adding up to my monthly bonus. The sale was almost set- it would be delivered tomorrow, and it would be assembled for free by the delivery team.\n\n_Customer:_ \"Can't you come here and assemble it yourself?\" \n\n_Me:_ \"I wouldn't be able to do so, since I need to stay here to help other customers like you\"\n\n_Customer:_ \"But I'd like you to come here and help me do it\"\n\n_Me:_ \"Our delivery team will be more than happy to install it for you, right on the spot\"\n\n_Customer:_ \"I don't trust any strangers in my house.\" \n\n_Me (in my mind):_ You met me 10 minutes ago through a chat\n\nAaaand the customer ended the chat before I could answer, and left a bad review. Fortunately, I could recover my stats, so I earned the bonus anyways! :D",

Before I could say anything, he was already frothing at the mouth.\n\n\"HOW COME NONE OF YOU IDIOTS CAN GIVE ME THE 80 MONTH FINANCING?!

We are currently running a promotion--\"\n\nAnd I'm immediately cut off. \"ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR, LITTLE GIRL?!

Our job was to handle queries from players (but in most cases usually their parents) in regards to helping them cancel their subscriptions or similar.\n\nOne morning I grab I series of emails from the inbox to work through. Most are the typical requests to cancel. A few of the more 'You stole my money types' - where a kid has used their parents credit card without permission. Happened a lot as far as I could tell.\n\nOne in particular, however, caught my eye. The email address ended @dod.gov\nThe writer explained how our 'small insignificant' foreign company was stealing money from his two credit cards. Credit cards that remain in a locked safe that no-one but his family have access to. Where he keeps his gun - this seemed important for some reason. By searching his credit card details on the in-house system I was able to find a couple of accounts - where the registered details would seem to suggest that they were connected to family members.\n\nI informed him as such and said that I could cancel all further payments and refund anything that wasn't authorised by the card holder. And any accounts linked to those payments would be banned from the game. A day or so later the response comes back that:\n\n&gt;You had better! Or so God help me I'll be sure to unleash the full Majesty of the United States Department of Defence on your little pathetic company!\n\nSo the payments were returned, the accounts linked to those payments banned.* Whilst I don't for one second believe that I was in any danger, the man's writing had me laughing. Whoever you were, I salute you Angry DoD Man!\n\n*we received a response from him a few days later asking why his sons' accounts were banned. *shrugs*",

They didn't run credit checks, so it attracted the lower rungs of the socioeconomical ladder. Some were simply uneducated, while most were a product of living in the ghetto and hustling to make ends meet. Which made for almost all the conversations frustrating and... Interesting. \n\nGrasshopper did, however, have strict pay policy. Customers had a 72hr grace period after the due date to pay before their phones were shut off and they were charged a $15 fee. \n\nWe would usually wave the $15 fee if they hadn't had it waived before, but this led to the most common argument:\n\nCSR: OK customer, I have waived the $15 fee as a one time courtesy. We would need $30 paid to restore your services.\n\nCUST: but you just gave me a $15 credit, I should only have to pay $15 to restore!\n\nCSR: we charged you $15 on top of your $30 which meant your bill was $45, then we took that $15 away, making the amount owed your regular $30\n\nLather, Rinse, repeat until customer asks for a sup.\n\nNow this is where my story comes in, I had a call like that and I raised my hand for a floor SME to come take the call. She looked at me nervously, then plugged in her headset. \n\nHer and the customer went back and forth, and I noticed the SME was rocking back and forth in the chair sweating. \n\nCUST: I don't understand, I should only be paying $15!\n\nSME: SIR, GET A CALCULATOR AND FIGURE IT OUT. I HAD MEXICAN FOR LUNCH AND I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM NOW, THANKS FOR CALLING HAVE A GREAT DAY!\n\nThe SME then smashed the release call button and ripped off her headset and left it at my desk still jacked in and ran to the bathroom.\n\nEDIT: This is surprisingly more common than I imagined.

        "text": "During the time I was in Tech Support for my call center, I spent the majority of the time on the overnight crew. Since I worked on the prepaid side of the client's service, this usually meant the majority of the work I did was very simple phone fixes and the rest being credit denial calls. It was pretty commonplace for someone to call in at 2 AM, ask for a credit, and then upon being denied would hang up and immediately call back to ask someone else. This guy, however, took the cake.\n\n\n\n\nHis name was Sean (which I have no hangups about typing out here, since I highly doubt it was his real name, plus our prepaid services didn't require a real name on the account) and he was a huge pain in the ass. His account had pages worth of notes detailing that he very rarely, if ever, put his own money onto the account and would just call in until someone put a credit to his line, just to get him to stop calling for awhile. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, shit didn't completely hit the fan with him until one specific bug happened. Back at the time, the client still offered daily access and pay as you go plans for flip phones, meaning you could use the phone for as little as .99c a day. Through a bug with the automated system, it would trigger a state on someone's account that made the system think they had paid the daily access fee, even if they didn't have enough money to do so. For the most part this was just a minor hiccup on the account most wouldn't notice, but Sean did. And started actively abusing it, essentially getting days worth of free calls on us for nothing.\n\n\n\n\nThe catch was, however, this broken state on the account was very easy to mess up, since any money balance change would essentially fix the system and make it work properly again, requiring a payment for services. So the pattern became Sean Smith would abuse free calls until the account started working right again, then he would call in to beg for a credit until someone gave it to him, with which he would break his account again and restart the cycle.\n\n\n\n\nIt was around 3AM ish, I believe, when I got a call from Sean Smith. His ask was simple - he wanted a one cent credit to the account. He wouldn't explain why, but I knew immediately he was trying to get more free calls. After spending a few minutes \"reviewing\" the account, I informed him we couldn't put an adjustment to the account. He immediately hung up. I thought nothing of it, notated the account, and figured that was it.\n\n\n\n\nTen seconds later, a co-worker from the spine over started talking to Sean. No surprise, I thought, some of our credit seekers were pretty dedicated to asking for adjustments. They told him the same thing, and he hung up. Almost instantly, the person next to them got Sean on the phone.\n\n\n\n\nIt was a very slow night, with barely any of us on calls, so the 14 or so of us on the overnight team watched with irritation, shock, and incredulity as Sean began spamming our center with calls. He would talk to someone, get denied, then instantly call back, at one point going straight from the front to the end of a single spine of people. Our supervisor had opened his account on her computer and monitored his account, all of us not believing that he was this dedicated. As time passed he grew more desperate, however. If he got somebody he knew had denied him he would immediately hang up and call in again, trying to get anyone to credit his line one cent.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, if you've been at a call center long enough you may guess how this story ends. You see, we were not the only center open overnight in the US, and eventually his calls started hitting the other centers that were active at that time. Most of those agents, being capable of the skill of reading comprehension, also denied his adjustment.\n\n\n\n\nBut there was one agent who we'll call W, who was somewhat infamous to our team for being someone who would credit a line to get a customer to go away and hope it would get him a good survey score. Sean eventually made his way to W, who, in his infinite wisdom, despite the huge amount of notes from just that night about his credit denials and the huge banner at the top of his account saying to NOT CREDIT THE ACCOUNT BY SUPERVISOR ORDER, proceeded to not just give Sean one penny, but a whole $5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe supervisor who had been monitoring Sean's account, after convincing herself to not slam her head into her desk and remove the credit, proceeded to screenshot and report W for not only helping a customer with what was essentially theft, but failing to perform his job duties and listen to the notated orders of a supervisor. Two days later, W's employee account was no longer active.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, Sean had called in about 60-65 times from 3 AM to 4 AM, with a single minded goal of trying to get one over on our client and not pay anything for his service. Sadly he's probably not the most crazy person I dealt with on the overnight crew, but this story is certainly one that'll stick in my mind for years.",

She honestly wouldn't be quiet and let me focus on what to do. \n\nCL: \"I will pay $100 and you are going to turn my Wi-Fi back on.\n\nR: (I have yet to tell her her account has been permanently disconnected) \"well here the issue, do to there was never a payment the service was TD in 12/09 and permanently disconnected 01/06. I would have to get this balance paid and create a new account\". \n\nCL: Well all I'm paying is $100, you going to give me WiFi for $20.00.\" \n  \n   I discover we have an ad on tv for internet for $20. But you have to have a phone line. Yea I don't agree but I can't control it. I go around and around in circles. I'm not getting any where. I knew this was going to turn into a sup call. Thankfully D took it. I went to lunch. I came back ask how the call went and she like that the craziest person she ever dealt with. She drop the bill down to $160. Lady was still negotiating saying she will pay $105 at the most. It turned into a second escalation. I hope I kept that account number. \n   \n    Would you have try to credit for those month? I wouldn't know how to request for paper showing she was in the hospital. I truly think some brain damage has happen. This doesn't give the conversation I had with her justice.",

The tech support is generally fine but for some reason people get both angry and stupid about billing issues. \n\nA woman with this heavy Spanish accent calls up about an issue on her account, she's going on about some $52 charge that had appeared on her bill but that I couldn't find, she ends up passing the phone to her husband who is already pretty heated for some reason and ends up taking the \"hey this is Michael from company on a recorded line\" like some kind of challenge. The first thing he tells me is \"that's good, that way we have proof that this happened\". Of course he demands my badge number and full name, we don't have to give our full names if we don't want so I just give him my badge number and he, like a well adjusted adult says \"alright 123456, is it alright if I call you 123456?\" I reply with the biggest smile in my voice I can manage as I try not to crack up \"I'd prefer Michael since it's more expedient but if you want you can call me that, the customer comes first here at company\" at which point for the rest of my time with him he continues referring to me as \"123456\" like it's somehow supposed to intimidate me or make me do what he wants. \n\nFinally he tells me that they got a $162 charge on their bill which I do have, I try and explain that it was because the bank failed the payment for last month for whatever reason and it got refunded back to his account so this new charge includes both last month and this month, and he is NOT having it, he goes off on this tangent about how when he first got to this country \"the first white person I spoke to told me 'have you accepted the glory of god into your heart' can you believe that?\" I let him rant for a minute or two and once it seems like he's tired himself out I try and direct the topic back on the bill and explain over it again with him, he ignores me again and just goes off on how if we're going to be charging him all this false money he wants to cancel and get all the money he's given us back and he'll report me to the BBB and get me fired since we're so sketchy, ect.\n\nEventually he says what I've been waiting for \"I want to talk to your supervisor\" we have a department for handling escalations that we can transfer to once they ask for a supervisor so I perk up, give him the weakest required pushback I can and he asks again, I tell him I can do that for him and warm transfer him to our escalations line and breathe a sigh of relief now I'm free of that idiot.",

It has now reached legendary status and can only be passed along verbally by us veterans and I only hope that it translates as well to written word.\n\nIt started off as a normal three minute refill call that was taken by a close friend who happens to be very religious.\n\nThe customer was a sweet lady from the deep south who was quite advanced in her years.  The call was uneventful until my coworker attempted to close.  Then this happened:\n\nCaller (with her pronounced southern twang):  \"Before you go, there is something I have to share with you.\"\n\nAgent:  Okay.\n\nCaller:  The other day I went to the Wal-Mart to pick up some cat food.  I was in the parking lot and it was cloudy, very overcast.  As I looked up, the clouds parted and the sun shone down and I saw Je-sus right there in the Wal-Mart parking lot!\n\nAgent:  Well that's just wonderful Mrs. Caller.  Is there anything else I could-\n\nCaller:  Now I write gospel music and I'd like to share an original song that I wrote with you.  (Caller starts warbling off key for a solid five minutes.  Every time my coworker takes a breath to speak, thinking she's done, the next \"verse\" starts until she's finally finished.)\n\nAgent:  I don't know what to say.\n\nCaller:  I know, it's just beautiful, isn't it?\n\nAgent:  I'm truly speechless.\n\n:)",

        "text": "Sorry for the bad title, it probably does not fit this situation perfectly.\n\n\nWe're all used to mindless scripts, chasing impossible stats and dealing with endless entitled customers and guests and we usually end up sounding like a robot....until you get that *one* caller.....\n\nI worked for a third-party call center that took overflow and seasonal calls for a large variety of companies and at the time I was taking customer service calls for a cruise line.  I had been lucky enough to have been on cruises, so it was a great fit, but due to the majority of entitled snowflakes I was getting pretty burned out.  \n\nOne of the call types we would get were guests already booked on a cruise calling to arrange and register for shore excursions at the various ports.  This cruise line sold 75% of the spaces on the excursions prior to the cruise and held the other 25% to be sold on the ship once the cruise was underway.  This made it fair for those people who didn't pre-plan every minute of their vacation ahead of time as well as for those who booked last-minute.   On peak-season cruises, we would sell out of that first 75% really fast and advised anyone that missed out, that they could book it once they board the ship.  There were no exceptions, no level of supervisor or manager could override this or \"open-up\" more spaces for ANYONE. (well maybe there was some super-speshull situations but I was never part of it)  \n\nAnyway, call from Mrs Middle America SoccerMom asking for an email confirmation for her shore excursions she had already booked the week prior.  Sure, no problem, easy peasy.  I go in and pull up her account and go over what has been reserved with her before I send the email.  (I don't think this was required, but I usually enjoyed these calls).  So I read it out and she says \"Well... that's not everything!\".   I tell her that's all I see here in the system, what was missing?  (at the same time I am clicking around in the history to see if anything was funky or got cancelled or something - nothing).   She tells me she should have 6 tickets for \"SuperDuper FuninTheSun Boat Tour\".  Hearing that, I already know in the back of my mind that it's probably sold out.  I look it up and yes it is - CRAP.  I tell her that I don't see those on her order, was she absolutely sure that she had requested them originally?   She starts getting panicky and swears up and down, back and forth that she had asked for those tickets along with everything else when she called the week before.  I apologize profusely and tell her that they are not on her order and that they are currently sold out but there will be spaces available once she boards the ship the day of the cruise.   This is where it happens.  She starts SOBBING, I mean full out bawling to the point I have no idea what she's saying in response.  Here comes my clarity.  All I could think was Goddammit stop acting like a spoiled brat.  You're going on a $5000 cruise and your bawling like a baby because you have to wait to get some stupid tour tickets until the day of your cruise?  Talk about first world problems. Thank God all I said was \"WHY are you crying?\"  Then I somehow snapped back into robot mode and did the empathy/consoling shit and re-explained the situation.  Honestly I can't remember much after that.  There might have been a supervisor transfer, or maybe she finally had to go.   I did tell this story to my team lead later and she thinks that maybe when the lady had called in the first time, the rep who booked everything never told her that specific tour was sold out and never sent her an email confirmation, which explain why she called asking for one.",

        "text": "I've never posted here before I really want to rant about this so hopefully this is okay. I'm a fairly new CSR at a large well known company and I just completed half my contract. Yesterday they informed me I would be moving to a new team under a different line of business. My boss initially asked me if I wanted to and I said no because I was finally feeling comfortable with my own line of business and felt like I could keep improving. I was genuinely content with where I was and saw myself staying in that role for a while even though I initially told myself I didn't want to work at a call centre. \n\nThe manager didn't like my answer and ended up taking me and my boss into her office to \"hear my reasons,\" which ended up just her bullying me into agreeing to do it. She was apparently surprised that I'd said no, even though I heard that others were asked and they'd also declined. \n\nShe tells me, \"if your contract were to end today and I offered you this position, what would you say?\" which I interpreted as a kind of.. threat? The way she spoke to me made me cry and then they tell me I'm not the only one who's cried in this office. Oh, in fact, my boss had the same thing done to her when she started! And look where she is now!\n\nYeah. Fuck that. So I was forced to move to an understaffed team halfway through my contract, and guess what? It's the same contract and all my vacation time still applies. Instead of hiring and training someone new, they're going to spend 4 weeks training me and by the time I'll be out on the floor taking calls, I'll only have 2 months left under my contract and then I might quit. And technically I'm also allowed to use up my vacation time, in fact I already had 3 days booked off for next month. The team I'm moving to has severe attendance issues and I'm tempted to use up my vacation time without giving a shit about that. I'm seriously considering quitting at the end of the contract due to the way the manager treated me. No wonder they have attendance issues. No wonder people just leave. \n\nI just don't understand how they think this is a good idea. They're going to end up having to hire externally either way. Instead of doing that, they managed to piss off a happy employee (myself) and  now I'm even less motivated to excel in this role. They could've hired someone new, and that person would be forced to come in every day since you're not allowed time off for the first 6 months. ",

Can you tell me the problem you were having?\n\nThe caller goes into detail about an issue that's really outside the scope of what I can do, so I sigh.\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah. I can't fix that.\n\n&gt;Client: You going to transfer me again?\n\n&gt;Me: Nah, I'll call them myself.\n\nBored tech is no longer bored.  I sit up, dial the numbers, and get no answer.  Fine...someone's asleep...again.  So I dial again. This time I get through, and enter our other player, 2nd Agent.\n\n&gt;2A: (Group name).  How can I help you?\n\n&gt;Me: This is (name) from (support area.)  Got a weird one.  Client is having (XYZ) problem...\n\n&gt;2A: Oh we don't handle that. Let me transfer you to the Support desk.\n\n&gt;Me: Wait...  Son of a... \n\nSo he transferred me.  BACK to the support desk.  The phone rang all of one time when Tech 2 enters the fray.\n\n&gt;T2: (His opening spiel...two seats down from me.) Can I have your login ID?\n\n&gt;Me: (rattles off my login, out of habit.) \n\n&gt;T2: (after a long moment) Dude...what are you doing? You know if boss hears you're playing...\n\n&gt;Me: I'm not playing with the phone. I just got punted here by (Group name). \n\nEnded up giving up on the call (client's idea, wasn't a major issue anyway), with the client noting that it seemed to have been \"call inception.\"  My boss found it amusing, though he was less than pleased with the other group.  Last I saw he was on the phone with their boss, and I got the impression someone was likely to lose their job for call avoidance. \n\n*TLDR:*  Call center inception. Agent gets transferred back to the service desk he works.",

(Luckily, my center allows us to do this, unluckily, I have to warn him three times before I can.)\n\nTM: (now screaming) Don't you fucking hang up on me, I've wasted an hour already calling in about this (as soon as he says this, I'm pulling up old cases, y'all, he had already been hung up on by five other agents that day, and four more the day before.) and you need to fix my fucking car.\n\nMe: You are outside the warranty that was provided by that lawsuit, we have no obligation to repair your car. \n\nTM: How do you reconcile having a job like that? Is $15.22 an hour enough for you to be yelled at by me? \n\nGuys, he knew down to the cent what my job paid, that freaked me out.\n\nMe: As you are continuing to be unprofessional, I am giving you a final warning, stop shouting and insulting me, or I will disconnect the call.\n\nTM: If you hang up on me I'm just going to keep calling back until you give me what I want.\n\nTwatface MacAsshole disconnected the call at this point, and I put myself in ACW. As I'm gathering notes from my call and the calls from the past two days, he calls in again to one of my coworkers and starts screaming at her loud enough that I can hear it from two desks over. I flag her down and tell her to just hang up on him, I'm handling it. \n\nY'all, by the time I'm done gathering evidence against this guy, I have nearly forty cases covering almost sixty calls over a two month span. How this guy hadn't already been blacklisted is beyond me. He had screamed at every single advocate on our floor except the newbies who had only been around for a few days.\n\nI forwarded all of my information to our division's supervisor and had the blacklist approved, his phone number was banned.\n\nSo of course, who is the first person I get a call from two hours later when I'm coming back from my lunch break? Twatface MacAsshole, calling on his friend's cell phone.\n\nY'all, I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face when I told him \"you have been blacklisted from our center, every advocate on the floor has been notified that because of your behavior and repeated abuse towards our staff, nobody here will assist you, ever, with anything related to our brand. Do not contact us again.\"\n\nHe started yelling something about a lawyer, but I cut him off mid-word terminating the call. I was giddy for the rest of my shift.",

This is a call I took for a customer about a week ago.\n\nMe: thank you for calling internet retailer, this is shesings, how may I help you? \n\nCustomer: yes, I am calling because I am having a problem with my order.\n\nMe: I will be more than happy to assist you, can I please have your order number? (After receiving number and pulling up the order) sir can you please confirm the name on the order?\n\nCustomer: *extremely long pause that made me groan inwardly cause I knew it would be one of those calls*..........what?\n\nMe: the name on the order? I just need you to confirm it so I can be sure I'm looking at the correct one.\n\nCustomer: ......what do you mean?\n\nMe: I need the name you provided when you placed the order. \n\nCustomer: what do you mean?\n\n*This goes on for SEVERAL minutes as I explain the question every way I can think of.*\n\nMe: (praying this is in fact the right order because that means he called the wrong division and needs to be transferred to the warehouse fulfilling the order) ok. Where was this supposed to ship to? \n\nThank God it was the right order and he became someone else's problem.",

I couldn't believe my eyes when it came across my screen...Robert Plant!!! Address was in L.A. if I recall correctly. A woman with a foreign accent answered. I collected myself and asked for Mr. Plant, she told me he was unavailable, still in disbelief I asked when he may be available and she informed me that he was in China for the next 6 months. That took any disbelief out of the equation...I called Robert Plant, too bad he wasn't home!",

After going through the tired script that we had to recite, I asked him the model and details of the router so I could look it up in the system and he told me it was under his desk with blinking lights so following my training I told him to unplug it for ten minutes and plug it back in. Unfortunately he ended up disconnecting the phone and my supervisor who was listening in as part of my training simply shrugged and walked away.",

        "text": "So let me tell you about my first job in a call centre. \n\nIt was my first job after graduation from uni and I was super excited. I had completed training and it was the second day on live calls. It was for a department store. I'll call it Everything's Here. \n***\nSo there I am willing and excited to help the customer as I plugged in my headset. Sure enough a customer comes  through. For the purposes of this post and brevity, I shall call him Nigel. \n\n&gt;[Me]: Hello and welcome to Everything's Here. Intelligence speaking. How can I help?\n\n&gt;[Nigel]: My flowers have arrived!\n\n&gt;[Me]: Oh. I'm so sorry about that sir. Let me just take you through some security and I'll have a look at what we can do for you.\n\nNow at this point the customer's all flustered and I'm  talking in my calm voice to reassure him that not all is lost. I proceed with security, and he gets all chatty.\n\n&gt;[Nigel]: Where are you based?\n\n&gt;[Me]: We're based in (location of city).\n\nNow yes, whilst I was born in England I grew up in a city with South Asians and so we still have an accent. \n\n&gt;[Nigel]: Well you don't sound like you're from England.\n\nAt this point I'm thinking, where has this come from? and repeat what Nigel's said so that my manager ~10 feet away could hear me.\n\n&gt;[Me]: Well I assure you sir, I *was* born here. \n\n&gt;[Nigel]: Just because you were born here doesn't mean you're from here! Let me speak to your manager!!\n\nNow at this point I was all confused. I hadn't even dealt with his query yet. Speak to a manager? Are you insane? So I repeat what he's just told me so that my manager who was within earshot heard me. She turned and said,\n\n&gt; I heard it all. Don't worry, just tell that guy there's no managers available since they're in a meeting. You are *literally* the only person who can help him.\n\nSo there I am left to take ownership and deal with this guy. Ugh.\n\n&gt;[Me]: I apologise sir but the mangers are in a meeting. I've had a look at your flower order and they're not due to be delivered until tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\n&gt;[Nigel]: Oh. Bye then. thanks.\n\nThen the manager came over and told me that nothing would happen and I dealt with the call as good as I could've. Still, story makes me laugh to this day.",

        "author": "TheDroolinFool",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5qtc0o/tfcc_in_2017_a_new_lease_on_life/",
        "text": "Hello All,\n\nFor a long time now, TFCC has been lacking an active moderation team. The sub was neglected and things started slipping through the cracks and subsequently quality control took a huge dive. I'm pleased to introduce myself as the new head moderator of TFCC. Those who frequent the sub will probably know me already.\n\nMy plan of action is as follows;\n\n**Queues, Reports and Moderator Mail**\n\n~~As you can imagine, since the previous moderation team was inactive for such a large amount of time, things are pretty messy behind the scenes. There’s a HUGE amount of reports, mod queue items and moderator mail that needs to be sifted through and my first priority is to get this cleared so we can return the sub to an operational state behind the scenes.~~\n\n~~Edit: Queues are huge, I mean literally, this is going to take days. Some of the stuff being thrown up is incredibly not friendly, racist and rude - most of these posts are being removed entirely. An awful lot of these posts are breaching the site wide rules - [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/zXZjtdj.png) and [more proof](http://i.imgur.com/5mGJQeM.png). It's going to be a long process but I'm determined to eject this stuff from the sub ASAP, this is not the content we want TFCC to be associated with.~~ \n~~\nReports queue now cleared - remaining queues to be cleared over the next few days (not urgent).~~\n\nAll queues now clear.\n\n**New Rules**\n\nI have introduced some very basic rules to the sub off the back of some of the shocking reports/posts found in the mod queues. Most subs on Reddit have their own subset of rules to keep things in order and TFCC should be no different. Rules are in the sidebar.\n\n**New Look and Tags**\n\n~~Over the coming days you can expect TFCC to be updated to a new modern theme. We’ll also be introducing tags on post lengths (short/med/long tags).~~\n\nImplemented as of 1st February. \n\n**Alignment with /r/callcentres**\n\n/r/callcentres/ is the natural sister subreddit of TFCC. The rules and theme mentioned above will align TFCC with /r/callcentres/. This is not to say that the subs will be merged into one; TFCC and /r/callcentres/ will continue to exist independently but will become more ‘integrated’ with each other as they essentially share the same subscriber base. TFCC will continue to provide a one stop shop for call centre related tales, however, we’ll be pushing for any non-tales to now be posted over on /r/callcentres instead as we want TFCC to flourish as a tales only subreddit. Most of the other ‘Tales From’ subreddits follow the same sort of rules and this works very well for them.\n\nIn essence;\n\n/r/talesfromcallcenters/ = Tales Only\n\n/r/callcentres/ = Everything Else\n\nEdit: ~~Based on the amount of reports I'm seeing in the queues for \"not a tale\" (at a quick glance) this is definitely something you guys want to see introduced.~~\n\nRules are now in place. Moving forward from now we'll be removing posts which aren't tales. Exact rule on this is:\n\n&gt;This is a tales based subreddit, as such we expect all posts to be actual tales/stories (i.e. there must be some sort of narrative and you must tell us a story).\n\n**Contests/Best of**\n\nWe plan to start running ‘best of’ contests very soon. The logistics of this are still being worked out but at a minimum we want to see a ‘Tale of the Month’ type contest each and every month - depending on popularity this maybe extended to weekly. I also plan on running a contest to celebrate our entire back catalogue of tales, perhaps an ‘All Time Top TFCC Tales’ as decided by our subscribers. You can expect these to be introduced shortly.\n\n\n**What’s the vision?**\n\nThe vision is simple, TFCC has been stuck in a rut for the last few years - coasting along. The sub will have new life breathed into it - our new rules, theme, integration with /r/callcentres/ and contests. TFCC will have a proud, active moderation team at the helm who dedicate time to it on a daily basis and promote the sub within the larger Reddit community.\n\nWe want to see more people participating and sharing their tales or commenting on existing ones. We want to get more fellow call centre workers subscribing to the sub than ever before and we want to take the sub forward to compete with the other ‘Tales from’ subs to become one of the best and form a thriving community.\n\n**Questions/Concerns/Comments/Feedback etc… are all welcome in the comments below and will be answered.**",
