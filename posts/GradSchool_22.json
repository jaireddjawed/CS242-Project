We need this 3.45 by our third semester even if we are still taking class (we have to take 5 total but the 4 highest are counted towards this gpa). Right now I am at a 3.3, taking my 5th class but it’s my fourth semester. I had dropped a class my first semester to better prepare and audit two classes math wise. If I get an A in this final class I will make the minimum gpa but since it’s a semester later (and I got my 2nd C last semester). I’m being recommended for academic probation. \n\nI have to appeal to the chair of the department/ grad committee - to see if they will reconsider probation if this semester I get an A. If not, I will have to continue taking 3 more classes (8 total for the minimum gpa but I don’t think I will be able to recover if I do it this way). \n\nI just feel lost tbh. The irony is I’m close to a paper (but my PI feels this is not strong enough to argue in my appeal since I don’t have a manuscript yet) - I am still working on measurements rn. I really don’t want to master out, I’ve worked too hard. My first C was because I had a really bad ulcerative colitis flare up - I was in excruciating pain practically all semester. My 2nd C - I don’t have any excuses i was a couple points off and it was ridiculously hard. \n\nIdk. Most days I just feel like a failure tbh. I’m frustrated - esp. when I’ve seen other students cheat and now their taking their qualifying exams already.",

(I won't go into details because I'm in a small field and prefer to maintain a degree of anonymity here on Reddit.) \n\nThe problem is the discussions. I feel like so many vague terms and concepts are being thrown around, it's hard to know what's actually being said. There are times when I will respond to another student, then the professor will chime in to say something, and I honestly can't tell if she's agreeing or disagreeing with what I just said. I feel like that classroom is an alternate dimension where people speak English backwards. \n\nI understand that this isn't an intro class per se, but I feel like there's a steep learning curve to anthropological side of the course, specifically regarding language. This is the second week and I don't think I'm getting much out of it. Should I stick it out since it ostensibly relates to my interests, or should I just cut my losses take something else? What should I look for to decide?",

I am a second year PhD student feeling increasingly hopeless about what I feel is a lack of guidance and supervision from my PI. \n\nI have just had to submit a comprehensive research proposal as part of my qualifying exams, outlining my results, discussion and future plans for my project. I previously sent it to my PI for comments but it came back without a single comment, only formatting changes. I feel like they don't know anything about my project and are happy to let me drive it 100% on my own. At the very beginning I really appreciated this intellectual freedom. But now I realise that they never ask for updates, only when I actively send new data to them, and even then they always just say its good data, my next plan is a good idea, etc. No questions, no alternative suggestions, nothing.\n\nI honestly cannot afford to fail this exam but at this point I have no idea if my research is even up to scratch because I don't get any critique on it at all. I don't think it is possible that everything I have done and proposed is good - there must definitely be some room for improvement somewhere, right?!? \n\nOf course I got into the program knowing that it involves independent learning and thinking. But is what my PI doing even normal? This is the one person whom I expect to be able to provide me with timely feedback but yet I feel like they can't be bothered at all. They know the big research question and just want me to get there on my own and publish somehow. \n\nI feel like I really had to get little rant this off my chest. At this point I don't know how long I can continue to motivate myself to push on. I don't expect to be handheld but I don't feel like i can do the best i can on this project without good healthy discussion, regular feedback and critique. I am also the only one working on this project in a very small lab, and I am so tired of feeling like im struggling alone 😔",

        "text": "Hello fellow (For now...) grad students! \n\nI'm a MS student in biology/ecology where I'll be assumingly graduating with my degree this semester. My goal has been, and still is, to attain my PhD. \n\nA bit of context...my MS program is funded but doesn't have a PhD that I can transition/apply to so I had to apply last semester to some programs, as well to the GRFP. And, well, it's not looking good. I can flatly say that I didn't get into any of the PhD programs I applied to, and have even more doubts about the GRFP. So...gap year.\n\nNow I'm not unused to not getting into grad school; it was my 3rd attempt that got me into just my MS program. The thing is, after years of contacting almost everyone that does interesting things to me, I've run pretty dry. I mean, this past year I was having to find entirely new people that did tangential work to reach out to. I might be able to find more people but its' genuinely getting hard to find people I haven't reached out to at low to mid-tier universities (That at least have PhD programs).\n\nWhile I have skills that could be easily transferred between most subfields of my topic, I have been picky-focusing on trying to find more applied topics that I can use in an industry/government job since...well luck hasn't been on my side in academia so far! So while I could keep branching out to just find *something,* it would not only be increasingly less relevant but also more niche...which may pigeonhole me career-wise. This focus on applied research over purely basic work has also made me not apply to higher-tier universities...which in my field tend towards more basic questions. It's not like I don't think it's interesting and technically is something I could change...but I wouldn't recommend it/count on getting in given the competition likely seen for those positions. \n\nThe other option is to just reach out to same people again and try to apply to the same schools again. I don't think my chances would increase between now and then...if 3 FA papers didn't get me in I doubt 5 (Probably would have 2 submitted at best) would prove the difference! It's all going to come down to being at the right place at the right time unfortunately...which I recognize is life but still.\n\nI've tried reaching out to my current MS PI about this but he (Who tbh is actually a bigger name in the field than most of the people I apply to work with lmao) but to quote him \"I could give you no names\". I also chatted with the other professor on my committee who does similar work and he couldn't give me any names either. Even emailing random other professors that I've collaborated with have only yielded \"have you checked out these 5 people?\" and in every case, I've either chatted with, met with, or applied for a PhD with all those people. I'm genuinely running out of options for potential PIs or schools that haven't rejected me...and as I work towards applying for that 5th time this coming year, I just don't know who to ask or reach out to anymore. My main method of using interests/similar research (i.e. using Google Scholar to find cool papers etc.) is just running dry unless I drastically change my interests, questions, and overall circle. And...I don't know where to begin.\n\nSo given all this, I wanted to see if anyone had any advice for me as I go about this 5th-and hopefully final-grad application cycle-particularly in how to find new people I haven't reached out to/ applied to before. I know this time I'll definitely be applying flat out to more schools...while I've be extremely quality&gt;quantity in the past, I'll be messing with that a little bit to give me more chances. And of course if there were ways to better increase my profiles' appeal as well I'd be all ears!",

Since it wasn’t essential to finishing my degree I dropped it (I had other projects to do). Now that I’m writing up my thesis, my PI is wanting me to finish and submit the manuscript and include it as a chapter in my dissertation. \nThe issue is this: the other student did 3/4 of the work and wrote about half of the existing manuscript (methods and results, I did the introduction). I've tried reaching out again, but have yet to get a response, and I am getting some pressure from my PI to submit. \nI'm unsure what to do, as I've already mentioned my ethical concerns to my PI but he says I can submit as the sole author and just include the student in the acknowledgments. I don't feel that this is right, especially since this would be the student's first first-authored paper, but I don't think my PI and I are seeing eye-to-eye on this.",

        "text": "I applied for graduate  school last year and got accepted back into the same university where I did my BS (graduated May 2022) starting this Spring semester. I made it clear from the very beginning that I wanted to do a thesis track, and the school kept telling me it would be no problem. I got in, and the first thing I did was talk to the chair of graduate studies over the bio department, who told me that I was accepted as a non-thesis student, and all I had to do was identify a thesis advisor during my first semester, but that I would be able to switch to a thesis track, no problem. They beg me to be a TA, since they're so short, and I end up as a full time grad student and a TA teaching 3 labs entirely on my own with no guidance, direction, or communication from anyone, on top of having a full-time job. It takes a month for them to get my tuition listed as in-state, for some reason, and after a million other problems, school starts back. I finally have everything worked out perfectly with my jobs, my schedule, and my set plan for the next year and a half of my life.\n\nFast forward to last Thursday,  around a week and a half after classes start. I email the chair to ask how I go about submitting my decision for a thesis advisor, if I needed to fill anything out, etc. and she emails back 9 hours later to tell me that the school is short on teachers, and they're all overworked, and she doubts I would be able to find an advisor, let alone someone with the time and funding to let me work in their lab. She tells me that my best best is to stay on non-thesis track.... AFTER telling me it would not be a problem, and gladly taking my time and money. Now I'm debating quitting my job to move elsewhere for school and taking out more loans, trying to go abroad, doing an online degree  somehow, any option that lets me get the type of degree that I was accepted for. \n\nIs this a common thing in grad school? If I'm overreacting about this, please tell me to calm down, but the school only accepted 3 graduates students for this program, and two of us were very clear that we intended to go for a thesis track, and now are both being told that these problems have been prevalent for years and they have been struggling with lab funding for a while. One of my favorite professors there even said to us, \"Wow, that's fucked up,\" so I'm really hoping this isn't just something I need to expect from graduate school. I'm still teaching labs, and grading assignments, and turning in homework, but it all just feels so.. pointless. Where can I possibly go from here?\n\nI could transfer to another school, but not be able to stay at my job and lose my healthcare and funding for school. I could stay on the non-thesis track, and potentially decrease my chances of acceptance into a PhD program. Has anyone else run into something like this?",

        "text": " \n\nHi Everyone!\n\nFor some context, I am in my 2nd term as a 1st year Master's student in biomedical engineering. Prior to this, while I was completing my undergrad degree, I lacked the opportunity to learn and foster a solid set of wet lab skills due to the pandemic (i.e., very restricted lab openings due to physical distancing, majority of the labs on campus being closed, lab courses being adapted for online learning). Upon my grad school admission interview with my current PI, co-supervisor and the post-doc I would be working with, I was upfront with them and stated that I did not have any wet lab experience, but I am eager and willing to learn. They didn't find this as an issue, and the post-doc reassured me that I would be getting a lot of training, and they all mentioned there would be a lot of people I would be able to seek for support. Moreover, my project would be something that is entirely brand new within the lab, and I would be the only one working on it, which would also include planning and optimizing the experiments. However, the post-doc I am working with did a similar project, and my PI and co-supervisor suggested that it would be best to work with her closely and to direct any questions to her.\n\nFast forward to the present, like the title of the post suggests, due to my lack of experience, I am finding hard to adjust to plan experiments and learn all the new lab techniques, and I am overwhelmed by it all. So far, I've only had a cell culture training with the lab manager and went over the basics, like recovering cell lines as well as freezing and passaging cell lines, and I found it quite useful with regard to the practical technique. But, the manager is not the best with verbal explanations, and I found it hard to get clarifications on cell passaging and split ratios, even though I have tried phrasing the questions several different ways to be more clear. I thought it would be a good idea to seek clarification on split ratios from the post-doc I am being mentored by, since she has routinely worked with cell cultures and the cell line I am working with (HepG2). Her response was, ***\"It's just a ratio, you know what those are right? Anyway, you shouldn't be asking me these things, it's never good practice to clear up any misunderstandings about something from somebody else.\"*** I'm not sure if I am overthinking it, but I felt stupid after that interaction and it was kind of awkward after, and she already knows that I have NEVER done any cell culture work before, and this was my first time doing so.\n\nIn addition, I have also asked for her advice on planning the experiments or any suggestions she may have based on my proposed plan, and her response is ***\"Just do what you want, or whatever method you see in the literature and find interesting, then adjust them accordingly to the scope of your project\"*****.** I understand that everyone has their own projects and tasks to take of, but it seems like she never has the time to let me shadow her in the lab or she cannot watch me once while I am doing the lab experiments once to provide any tips or point out any errors that I am making.\n\nOverall, I am feeling overwhelmed and I am not too sure what to make of this experience so far, since they all gave the notion that I would have an ample amount of support / guidance, but it feels as though I am not getting any, and I'm not too sure who to turn to. Are all master's projects structured this way (i.e., working alone on a brand new project, extensive planning and optimization)? Another master's student in the lab doesn't seem to have as much work as I do for their project, and is getting plenty of help from the another post-doc in the lab. Am I overthinking all of this? \n\nAny advice / suggestions / relevant experiences are welcomed ! :)\n\n**TLDR: Lack of guidance as a grad student causing me to become overwhelmed, and I am not sure who to turn to.**",

I have been going above and beyond to do my experiments and also help out at the lab because it’s only me there. No lab technician or other students just me, so I do my experiments plus I also clear out the lab and make sure everything is in order. \nMy problem now is that my main experiment has been failing I can’t seem to yield any results, and when I ask her for help she tells me I need to think on my own and when she tries to help she ends up yelling at me and putting me really down. \n\nI go home everyday after the lab and cry; she’s been really affecting my mental health. \n\nI have been thinking about reaching out to my co-supervisor to see if I could work in their lab for a while but I’m not sure if I should do this behind her back. Or ever reaching out to my thesis advisory committee but once again idk if I should go behind her back or talk to her about it first. \n\nIf anyone can give me some advice that would be greatly appreciated thank you !!",

I do full stack web dev full time, and I don’t know jack shit about AI/ML, embedded systems, or any other popular CS research topics. I just make websites. \n\nThis program has also given me no direction, as in the freedom to take any direction? But I don’t even understand who why where how or what. \n\nPlease be kind, here are my questions:\n1. In CS, how does one pick a thesis topic? Does the professor give the student options? Does the student give a professor options?\n2. How do I pick a professor ? What is it called again when they are my mentor for my thesis? I can see all of their research interests online, but again I’m a web dev and a lot of them are into AI/ML, AR, VR, etc. I don’t know how to even approach them on this.\n3. During your “thesis” semesters what are you even doing all day? \n4. How much does the professor guide your research or help you “pick a problem to solve”?",

I know I’m getting ahead of myself and there’s still the official interviews but still…it’s tormenting me because I’m a very indecisive person and I feel like this decision is going to impact my whole career/life.

But also, the school where I did my undergrad and did not have that good of an experience…quite isolating and alienating, I barely made friends, always felt out of place and did not feel like the psych department was supportive or welcoming. I know that grad school is different but still…the PI seems nice but I can’t tell if I’m that passionate about his research, it’s interesting but I don’t know.. something isn’t clicking. The good thing is that he seems open to grad student doing their own thing research-wise (within the confines of his lab’s mission). Still, I don’t know if that’s what I want to study for the next 5-7 years. Another problem, it’s his first year as a prof so he doesn’t have a track record of supervising PhDs, only has one PhD student so far… so quite a small lab. Also, I know that assistant profs generally have more pressure to publish to get tenure and I don’t know if he puts pressure on his grad students too. This program is also very CBT-focused and I have some interests in psychodynamic stuff as well. But again, very prestigious program that churns out world-class researchers. BUT, I don’t want an academic career although research does interest me and I want to have good training and the chance to publish/present at conferences…one last pro for this school is that it’s fully funded. And one last con is that it’s gotten very politically/ideologically divided in recent years with stupid debates about “wokeness” and stuff which I find sooo boring I know this shouldn’t be a criterion but it contributes to the bad atmosphere of my undergrad which I mentioned previously.\n\nSchool B: still pretty well-regarded school but less so than A. have a very good rapport with the prof and met some of her grad students which I got along with too. Her research is more aligned with what I want to do and what I did in undergrad so I feel more comfortable with it. But, she has a few granted projects that she wants grad students to work on and that aren’t my primary interests. She is a less research-focused prof so I feel like I wont have the opportunity to improve my research CV under her if ever I want to pursue that later on (although one of her previous grad student is a researcher but all the other ones are clinicians only). The program is known for having very good clinical training in a variety of approaches which I love. They have psychodynamic-focused courses and profs! I also just like the structure of the program in general. From talking to her grad students and other grad students in the program it seems like a very welcoming environment with a strong sense of community in each cohort. One major con is that it’s not funded at all, and students need to have for their own funding (which I don't know if I'll get under this PI's supervision). The TA salaries are also way lower than in school A. still, I get a better “vibe” from the school but feel like it would be insane if I got accepted into the other one to refuse it because it’s so competitive (and well-known and funded etc)\n\nI might have forgotten some things but just wanted to have thoughts from…strangers I guess because I’ve been driving my friends and family nuts with this. i guess if I don't get into both this wont be an issue but I want to prepare just in case",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI’m a undergrad senior graduating this spring and am planning to attend a graduate school program (hopefully a good one 🙏 ) this upcoming fall 2023 semester. I am essentially taking no technical classes this semester due to wanting to explore hobbies/other activities whose class times then conflict with the (graduate level) STEM courses I would have otherwise taken. As of now, I will be auditing/sitting in on a couple of courses though, and I am definitely learning stuff on my own time - just not in the classroom. In addition, I have taken a large number of graduate courses all of my other semesters in undergrad and have done well in them. Through this process, I have learned that, strictly speaking, I don’t need to take a course in order to adequately learn the material. \n\nHowever, I heard that the grad school admission process may have interviews which may ask which courses you are currently taking. Further in the future, jobs, interns, grants and whatnot will also ask for your undergrad transcript, at which point a nontechnical last semester may indicate indolence or contentment. So I’m wondering if my decision to relax a bit and study on my own time will reflect poorly on my future career prospects. Thank you for your time and consideration!",

        "text": "I chose this PhD program because I really loved this one research group, but now I found out that this PI filters students by GPA, and my first semester GPA was bad (3.3). I applied to 2 other labs as well, but I’m afraid they will also reject me for the same reason. \n\nMy second choice is the professor who taught the class that I got a B in… in my program, B means “below average,” so there is no way they would accept me. \n\nI didn’t interact that much with my third choice PI because they have a reputation of being abusive and 50% of their grad students end up dropping out. \n\nI’m panicking so much because no one told me that grad school GPA will determine what lab you end up in— even my academic advisor told me “grades don’t matter so long as you pass.” I feel so worthless and pathetic and I’m ashamed to even show my face on campus. I’ve been crying all weekend and sleeping the entire time because I feel paralyzed from fear. What do I do if I don’t get into any research group? \n\nPlease just give me some advice.",

        "text": "I’m a year out of my undergrad and while teaching in the public school system for a year I found it’s not my thing and I should start going for my next step, grad school for ethnomusicology. I was wondering if it would be ok or impolite to reach out to the professors at the school in my area to ask about the program, what to expect, and to get to know them. \n\nA little background- I applied late, so I’m also worried about how my application process might be different. I also paid a late app fee so that leads me to assume my application will still be considered. After I finished my application, I got an email talking about next steps. One of them is to wait for them to schedule an audition or an interview. I’m going to assume this degree doesn’t require an audition, but it is typical for more performance based music majors (even education in undergrad) to have a music audition. I would also ask about that, because if there is one I would need to start preparing for it like yesterday. I would also ask this question among others. \n\nI’ve tried googling whether I should email faculty about the program, but some answers say it’s fine while others say it’s not a great idea. Any opinions on this?",
