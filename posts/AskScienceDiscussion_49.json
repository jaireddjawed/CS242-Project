Can you actually experience 1,000 years in a short time or is there a limit of time per seconds?\n\nFor example you can dream and feel like you spend a week in there but it was just a few hours. However you didn’t actually experience a week in there or you would have probably gone crazy. It may feel like a long time but it’s not genuinely a long time like it would be with thinking at the speed of light.\n\nSince you’re not thinking at the speed of light I would think there would be limits but I’m not sure.

The quantum physics is something I'm not able to wrap my mind around yet. \nIs quantum the next step to knowing the universe more detailed, on even a smaller (larger/deeper) scale than the classic interpretation? I guess from what I've understood, it's helping us predict almost any case, taking all of the \"usually disregarded parameters\" into consideration, and helps us unveil even more complex \"forces\" and how they interact, on this particle scale. (!?) Am I on the right track? Feel free to answer all of these and expand on some of your own thoughts. :)",

Wouldn't a dedicated individual be able to choose their diet accordingly for body odor?\n\nOther questions: 2) To what extent can a diet change alone change things - surely we can't make sweat smell like perfume. 3) Culture will surely have a strong impact on reception, but are there any diets/ethnic groups that are generally nice smelling? 4) How quickly will a change in diet replace one's previous aroma?",

That said there are some things that lets be frank i don't understand and can't find answer to.\n\n**What I think I know**\n\n*\"A CME is an explosion on the Sun sends a ball of plasma (and magnetic field) off the surface of the Sun in some direction. If the CME is aimed at Earth it could cause problems when it collides with the Earth's magnetic field, sending showers of high-energy particles through the Earth's atmosphere.\"\n\nA Carrington event could knock out power for most of the world.  The worst case scenario could last anywhere from 2-10 years.  Potentially massive damage to electronic infrastructure.  With little to no dmg to small electronics, cars or planes. \nShouldn't harm people, plants or wildlife?  The visible aurora could light up the night sky for a week.\n\n**Communication**\n\n“In the aftermath we might experience a total lack of radio communications capability, because ions in the atmosphere absorb or reflect radio waves?” With an accompanying aurora that can last for up to a week. Precipitating electrons can enhance other layers of the ionosphere and have similar disrupting and blocking effects on radio communication.”\n\n[old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/34cwot/what_would_happen_if_the_solar_storm_of_1859/)\n\n[old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6kwbdy/are_we_prepared_to_handle_a_direct_hit_from_a_cme/)\n\nNone of the old post answer most of the questions i'm asking.\n\n\n**What i'd like to know**\n\n*How strong a storm would it take to knock out power on a global scale?\n\n*What physically happens to our satellites in orbit?\n\n*Would happens to space stations &amp; the astronauts inside?\n\n*How much warning might we have?\n\n*What precautions could we take in the time we have to prepare?\n\n*What would we see on earth?\n\n*Who's job is it to watch the sky for a living and warn us?\n\nThanks in advance",

However, I've actually wondered about this one for a good while now. \n\nSuppose you have a monkey, let's say a chimpanzee, that you've been teaching sign language for a couple of years now. Things are going well and the chimp knows almost forty different signs. That's great.... Only, there's still something lacking during the monkey-man communication session: everything that the chimp is learning from you is just that, *communication*. There is nothing that will ever be recognizable as an actual conversation between the two of you as the chimp simply can't grasp the concept of true language and the potential it has for expressing an endless and near infinite variety of information to you. The chimp will never spontaneously say \"hi\" to you, nor will she ever ask you a question.\n\nHowever, today will be *very* different, that's for sure. After familiarizing your chimp with its classes with you for two years now, ensuring that each class is on a very consistent schedule and consists of more or less the same subject (which is sign language), you finally feel ready, if a little nervous (and you probably should be in all honesty), to initiate the second part of your experiment: introducing your monkey pal to a little electric kool-aid. And this will simply be the first of many sessions like this, for the chimp will taking hits of acid right before every class starts from now on. \n\nNow, I admittedly don't know much about chimpanzee neurology, nor do I know much about LSD's effects on the brain, but I do know that chimpanzees apparently have the same structures in our brain that we have (which are the so-called \"language centers\" of our brains), and that the key difference between their language center and ours is that ours have many, many more neurological connections within them. I also happen to know that LSD and other psychedelics are famed for being able to help people approach problems and come up with solutions that they would have never even imagined in a normal state of mind; and, most importantly, that LSD can **increase the amount of connections within one's mind by allowing different regions of the mind to communicate with one another when normally, they wouldn't be able to do so**.\n\nSo, my fellow redditors who are hopefully more qualified to speculate on this than me: given the specific parameters of this scenario/experiment, could a monkey on psychedelics make significant gains in learning where they couldn't before? If so, then given enough time, could this be a way of shaking up whatever their normal chimp thought process might be juuuust enough to get them to be able to grasp the concept of language? \n\nOr would this experiment simply wind up being a waste of time?
