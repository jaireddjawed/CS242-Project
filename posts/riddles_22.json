        "text": "[Start here](https://imgur.com/a/lQ7VaBx)\n\nThis is an online scavenger hunt that has a certain amount of cryptocurrency as a reward. You don’t need to be a professional cryptographer or have PhD in math to solve it. But you have to be quick.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nI put 0.1 ETH (Ether) into an electronic wallet. All you need to access it is a private key. It is a 64-character string that you should enter at [myetherwallet.com](https://myetherwallet.com) to access the wallet. Once you have access it’s basically like a regular wallet - you can take the cash and leave it empty. You will have to transfer it to your wallet to own it. You can create your own Ether wallet at [myetherwallet.com](https://myetherwallet.com) or through MetaMask Chrome extension. When the transfer is complete the money is yours. Congratulations, you own crypto now. At it’s highest 0.1 ETH was worth about $135.\n\n**How do I get the key?**\n\nThe key is broken down into 29 pieces. Each piece is numbered, when you line them all up you will end up with a key. To get each piece you have to solve a puzzle. Some are really simple, some need more work. To make this even more interesting I will remove the prize in 24 hours after the start. You better be quick.\n\n**What do I need?**\n\nInternet and a good QR code reader. An app to move links from mobile to desktop should speed things up, I recommend Pushbullet. Graphic editor may also help. There is a couple of apps you may need but you will figure this out as you go, they should be self explanatory.\n\n**Should I work in a team?**\n\nYou can, it will speed up the solution if team members are working in parallel. Puzzles are not sequential with two exceptions. You will have to split the prize money though.\n\n**Will I get hints?**\n\nI’m going to monitor a reddit post that will have the most activity and will help players if there are technical issues. If a lot of players get stuck I will provide a hint.\n\n**Why are you doing this?**\n\nI like puzzles and I’m fascinated by crypto. I’ve seen a few crypto puzzles before but they were very complex and aimed at a small crowd who knows enough about crypto and is really good at math and cryptography. I wanted to create a challenge that doesn’t require any special knowledge so more people can participate. If enough people like it I will do this on a regular basis.\n\n**Why Ether?**\n\nBecause for the same amount of money the bitcoin number would have been even more laughable :) Ether is the second most popular crypto, it also powers applications on Ethereum network and can be exchanged for a number of other Ethereum tokens such as CryptoKitties.\n\n**Why only 0.1 ETH?**\n\nI didn’t buy ETH when it was super cheap so I had to pay market price for it. I’m hoping for next rounds I get enough people to donate to the prize fund to make it more substantial.\n\n**Can I donate to the prize fund?**\n\nSure, send ether to the prize wallet directly:\n\n0xFAc5A080b72745389DeC24E3e26F0AA9d4022632\n\nEdit:missing link",

I ask A, B, C if 2 \\+ 2 = 4. Ok, but how will I know what they will respond? I will answer for them with everyone saying Ozo, or I can choose which C will say Ulo this time, but the next one will say Ozo because he lies and tells the truth at random?  \n\n\nAnd if I ask one of them if he is A, how will I know if he will answer Ulo or Ozo if I still don't know that he is A, then it is impossible to know if he is lying, telling the truth or being random?",

This may be restricted to just saying \"solved\" or \"correct\" if I notice it being abused.\n\n- Reddit's new default spoiler tag is now supported. I'd prefer you continue to use the /s style spoiler though.\n\n- Users can post a top level comment that does not contain a spoiler tag, as long as it begins with \"Question:\", \"question:\", \"Discussion:\", or \"discussion:\". Be sure to include the colon (:). \n\nHere's the spoiler tag format we prefer you use. I'll type it here in 2 different ways in case your app has trouble with one format:\n\n- `[spoiler](/s \"text in quotes\")`\n\n- \\[spoiler]\\(/s \"text in quotes\")\n\n- result: [spoiler](/s \"text in quotes\")\n\nIf you are using iOS, using Reddit's built-in spoiler tag may be easier for you:\n\n- `&gt;!text goes between these symbols!&lt;`\n\n- \\&gt;!text goes between these symbols!&lt;\n\n- result: &gt;!text goes between these symbols!&lt;\n\nFor posterity, the previous policy update post can be found here: https://old.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/7rbzry/meta_policy_update_toplevel_comments_will_be/",
