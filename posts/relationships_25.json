        "text": "Basically what the title says, we've been very good and close friends since we've meet (3 years ago) except for one time we had a fight* (explained at the end) then make amends.\nNormally I wouldn't mind about this stuff since is not something really important but for some context she is the type of person who usually post everything and I have noticed since we make amends (like 1.5 years ago) she doesnt really \"show me\" on her insta whereas before she did a lot also I have checked her pinned histories and have the feeling that some with me maybe be removen not sure since is not something I normally see.\nI started see it as weird in my birthday when I asked her to upload a picture of us (like she always asked me) and she said she something like she not really active bla bla okey I didnt want to push or cause drama but the thing is she is active.\nI know at the end of the day what matter is if she is a good friend or not, which she is, or if she has bad gestures towards me which I would say no, It's just this little thing that bother me a little bit because I dont really find any logical reason for it.\nLike I can get sometimes you dont feel like, you dont like the picture, etc, but I dont know I just see weird in this specific case.\nWhat are your thoughts about this?\n\n*Fight: As you can guess we've meet during corona in the gym and we just became really good and close friend you know those who chat 24/7 (probably because of corona) and we used to go to the gym together, sometimes I thought it was a bit weird because she has a boyfriend and she really used to text me a lot like in all social media sending me silly stuff, or just telling/asking me about something so we kind of became a bit of jealous friends and during one period I also had others problems and I guess I didnt handle everything right and kind of let some toxicity to the friendship.\nSo she just told me about it, we talked, then \"fight over\" (like she was the one screaming) basically I said I was sorry if I make her feel bad It wasn't my intention but she also had sometimes jealous stuff (that was what made her angry) and that I didnt think it was a good idea talk in that mood.\nNext day she text me over to check on me and saying sorry for overreacting I said no worries, said sorry again and that if I do something toxic in the future (which i dont think i have done) just let me know before.\nThen we gave each other a bit of space, not forcing the friendship, but It was clear that we both understood it wasnt malicious on any part and that we missed each other.\nOf course we dont text 24/7 like before but now there is no corona and she is also working so I guess is just different situation.\n\nTLDR: A good and close friend stopped showing pictures of us in instagram, at first I thought because of a fight we had, and after some good health time I started realized is only with me, even though the rest of the friendship is almost the same before the fight. Is it weird? or Am I overthinking?",

We had to answer really quickly, I‚Äôve never played volleyball and I know I‚Äôm not physically built to be good at that sport üòÖ I wasn‚Äôt sure I would like it enough to commit for a year in a team so we ended up saying no, but I said we would be happy to substitute if someone was missing. \nAfter, in private, my BF asked me if I would be bothered if he played in the team without me, and I said I wasn‚Äôt really comfortable with this situation. I don‚Äôt really like the idea of my boyfriend seeing my friend once a week while I struggle to see them once a month‚Ä¶ I told him that I would feel left out and that I prefer to keep a kind of boundary so my friends ‚Äúremain my friends‚Äù \n\nHowever, during the year, my female friend asked my BF to be a substitute 3-4 times and never offered me. I told my boyfriend I was hurt that nobody thought about inviting me first. He ended up telling my friend and she invited me to play one time. I really enjoyed it but I wasn‚Äôt really good to be honest (note that I‚Äôm a really athletic person and I really enjoy sports but I‚Äôm petite and I‚Äôm clearly not the strongest one üòÖ).\n\nAfter that, she continued to invite only my boyfriend. She also invited him to be a substitute in her other soccer team, again with a bunch of my friends. Last week he told be that one of my friends was in the hospital, he was told at this soccer game, I didn‚Äôt even know‚Ä¶\nToday he told me ‚Äúhey I think I would like to join the soccer team with your friends this summer‚Äù. Nobody even asked me if I would like to play too‚Ä¶ \nAm I overreacting or it feels like nor my boyfriend, nor my friend really think about how left out I feel in this situation? I never had this discussion with my female friend, but my boyfriend was well awarded of how I felt in regard to this situation this year and it‚Äôs like he don‚Äôt even care ? \n\nIf we wants to play soccer, can‚Äôt he just pick the phone and ask some of his friends to play with him? He never even call his own friends‚Ä¶ \n\nTLDR : My boyfriend wants to join a soccer team with my friends, even if he knows I feel left out and I‚Äôm not comfortable with him becoming closer to my friends than me.

        "text": "My (31f) husband (38M) and I have different love languages for sure, one of mine for example is acts of service. \n\nIt hasn't really been an issue in our relationship. The only real complication is in high stress moments, I crave physical touch in those moments, he absolutely does not and it leaves me really unsure how to comfort him sometimes. \n\nWhat's really getting me lately is sex. \n\nWe both have fairly high drives, which was great until I got pregnant. He was incredibly careful/paranoid at the start and wouldn't have sex with me at all during the first trimester. \n\nI'm well beyond that now at 20 weeks but we've only had sex twice now since November. \n\nI can live with that, before him I went I through like a 7 year dry spell lol \n\nWhat bothers me is our approaches to the whole thing. \n\nFor him, he masterbates a couple times a day at least which is fine. More often than not, I'll \"help\" when he's in that mode, so he's getting touched, played with, getting off with my help which I do enjoy. \n\nI'll do this voluntarily, like he'll be sitting on the couch with his robe open for example and I'll snuggle up and start playing. \n\nThe issue im having is every once in a while he'll bring up that I haven't \"asked for his help\" in a while. \n\nHe thinks that if I want sex or to be touched in that way, I should initiate/ask.\n\nFor me I've always been an \"in the moment\" type of person where if the situation arises and we get going, great! Or if we're spending time together, I'm touching him and he touches me, fantastic but I don't feel like I should have to ask to get intimate. \n\nI've said that before and from his prospective, if I want to get intimate then I have to seduce/initiate/ask otherwise it won't happen. \n\nBut he doesn't ask? At most, sometimes when we're cuddling he might take my hand and put it on his junk but that's it. \n\nI've asked him about it before and he always says \"well why don't you do the same thing? If you want me just take my hand and move it where you want it. Act sexy, initiate it, take what you want!\" \n\nBut to me that doesn't feel right. \n\nTo me it feels like I have to \"earn it\" by doing that and it makes me just shy away from it more because I feel like if he wanted me, he'd want to touch me without being asked. \n\nIs this a love language thing? Is it just a incompatibility in the way we view sex? Or am I just over thinking things at this point?\n\nTL;DR My husband's thinks I should initiate/ask when I want sex but I that feels like I have to \"earn\" sex if I want it when he doesn't have to do the same thing. Is it a love language issue? An incompatibility I'm our views of sex? Or am I just over thinking?",

He's very polite and introverted. I am attracted to him. However, I just don't find him exciting. I've found previous partners more fun and laughed a lot with them. With him, it feels like so much time spent in silence. As an extrovert, I find this more and more frustrating. I find I act out because I am seeking some stimulation from him. I'll tickle him, annoy him, just to get some reaction. He's not creative, fun-loving, or adventurous. He wants to eat the same foods, and do the same hobbies. He is happy having 3 friends who he sees once per month. I am someone who likes to try new things, laugh, joke around, chat. Even though we are compatible sexually, with what we want for our futures, and our morality, it's this fundamental personality difference that is starting to get to me. When I'm working a lot I don't notice it because my own social/emotional bandwidth is smaller. But, I started a new job where I am much less stressed and all of a sudden these problems are back on the table for me. I'm scared because I love him and we are planning our futures. I'm also scared because I feel like I'm getting older and it's harder to start again. I want to have a family and settle down in life. I don't know what to do. I've tried to explain to him what bothers me but ultimately it's just his personality and he can't change who he is.\n\nBreaking up seems extreme and it's not a guarantee that I'll find someone as good as him. He is someone I care for dearly. He meets so many of my expectations. It's just this hole I feel, this fundamental and core part of myself that isn't getting met/stimulated and I don't know how to reconcile it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I don't find my boyfriend fun anymore but I love him.

We argued, she told me to leave the room, so I threatened to cut my trip short which I appreciate may have been petty but I really wanted to leave.\n\nAfter a while I came downstairs and was basically gaslit into apologising as she said she was doing it for my own good and that she loved me, and that I was overreacting because I‚Äôd had a few drinks that evening. I did drink a fair amount as we had been out at the pub but I still remember clearly what was said so I feel like my feelings have been completely invalidated because I was ‚Äúfull of alcohol‚Äù and therefore apparently unable to rationalise my thoughts. I apologised purely to keep the peace and not make my boyfriend feel uncomfortable.\n\nAfter this altercation I honestly don‚Äôt even want to come home because I was sat on the sofa with family trying to watch a movie and was basically told how fat and I ugly I am and I‚Äôve had enough. I never asked for these comments I just wanted to relax.\n\nWhat do I do to properly communicate that I don‚Äôt want to talk about my appearance? I have regular check ups, I‚Äôm healthy, I just have large breasts and some fat, so it‚Äôs not even like I‚Äôm massively overweight and eating myself to death so I don‚Äôt know why she feels the need to comment.\n\nTLDR: my mother won‚Äôt stop insulting my looks and it makes me regret visiting home",

I hadn't felt love like this for a long time. But: he was bread crumbing me, a cycle of showing affection and then ghosting me for 4 days or so each week. It lasted a month. On Valentine's day we had our last date, I cooked for him, put together a bag of gifts as his bday was a few days earlier. We had sex, right after which he said he has to leave as he needs to wake up at 4am for work. He seemed so cold and distant, I started freaking out, particularly because of his cold and hot showers, I assumed this was another cold shower after a sweet date. I felt vulnerable. I suggested we might be better off to not meet again or meet less. He got upset, rejected to hold me before leaving my apartment, left and the following day he suggested to take a break for a couple of weeks. He then gave me silence treatment, and I sent him a poem and then a video and he kept silent and did not respond to my question whether it was over for him. A colleague of mine matched with him on Hinge, they had discussed their recent experiences, he had disclosed info that she had learned it must have been me, he hadn't given her my name. He had told her that my reaction to him had seemed crazy, and that he has pulled out but does not need to tell me it is over as we dated only for a short period of time. I was so upset. It took a week or so. I sent him a text complaining that he had called me crazy, and that he had asked for a break, but told his match that we were done, but never thought it was important that I learn as well. He sent me the following text, I am still wondering whether this is a breakup goodbye, or he is still keeping it open. I still have strong feelings for him, and he has claimed he is not going out with the colleague of mine, they only chatted a few times. I know the situation is bad and full of red flags, but my concern is whether this is his goodbye or not. \n\n\"I was upset with the way you responded.  I told you I had to wake up at 4am and you disregarded my work.  Then your response was very hyperbolic and it threw me off big time.You are a great person and very nice to me.  You‚Äôre intelligent and physically beautiful as well.  I always was very kind to you.  It was reciprocated. Regarding the girl [my colleague], I met her online.  I‚Äôve never met her in person.  We had a brief text exchange.  I told her you came off hyperbolic in you response and it pushed me away.  I never mentioned your name or anything.  I would never try to expose you.  She starts snooping and trying to figure out who you were.  Then she asked some guy to ask you and you apparently told him my name.  And that is how it connected.  I told her things thinking you were anonymous.  But this girl decided to snoop heavily to try to figure out who you were.   Then called you despite not knowing me or knowing you.  That is just odd considering I don‚Äôt know her and neither do you. Overall, I think you are great and we connected well.  You are a beautiful person inside and out.  I just hate you acted like that over a minor issue:  I hate that this girl decided to do what she did.  In my opinion, she didn‚Äôt have a good motive behind it.  Especially since she doesn‚Äôt know either of us.\"\n---\n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question",

He is coming next to me for his college studies. \nI don‚Äôt know why but he started 2 petty arguments and said I didn‚Äôt put any effort in the relationship. Well he apologized and felt really bad, and corrected his behavior. The problem is that it frightened me a bit, not because he was violent or anything (he is always respectful with me) but because arguments stress me. He asked again if he could change anything so I would feel better. \n\nWednesday I canceled plans I had with him, that involved him taking a long trip to come earlier to see me, so I could be with friends. He got upset again. \n\nThursday night, he told me it wasn‚Äôt fair to him to do all the efforts. I told him I didn‚Äôt get why he wanted to spend so much time with me. He told me we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in one week and that it was because he loved me. I snapped. I told him i needed space, that he was toxic and possessive, that he wasn‚Äôt my priority and that I wanted to live my life and go to parties. I told him I wanted to see him once per week and the weekends. He told me that it wasn‚Äôt understandable to see each other the weekends while we live in the same city. I told him that the fact he moved next to me stressed me and that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a long distance relationship. He began to cry a bit and told me he didn‚Äôt know how to make me happy anymore, and that we weren‚Äôt compatible. He then said he loved me. \n\nThat comment really hurt me. I think I have a mental block with him. \n\nIs there anyway I can still salvage this relationship or was what he said too much ?\n\nTL;DR : My boyfriend‚Äôs comment hurt me and I don‚Äôt know if i can save our relationship.",

        "text": "I (19M) am living with my gf (22F) of 5 months. She always tells me I'm the love of her life and I'm the first guy she really loved, also she was the first one to say I love you in our relationship. Everything between us is perfect, the sex is amazing (her words), the dates, and every moment I spend with her I'm at peace. A week leading up to our anniversary we would stay up late alot and talk about stuff like her past, she would keep mentioning her ex, who cheated on her after a 10 month relationship. I found it a bit concerning how often she brought him up, and was concerned she wasn't over him since their breakup wasn't too long ago. I remembered when 3 months into our relationship she got a text from her ex in front of me, and she said she would respond to him later. Later she told me he wanted to get back and she just told him to fuck off. Out of curiosity, I opened her phone while she was in the bathroom (fucked up I know), and went through the messages expecting her telling him to fuck off since she always talked badly of him. However I found a long conversation between them from that night, starting with him telling her he fucked up etc to which she responded by saying she hates him for what he put her through. However after some back and forth she calms down and tells him she misses him and what they had was very special. This then escalates into some light flirting which is then ended by a goodbye from him but she goes on by saying she likes his profile picture, thats where the conversation ends. Digging further I found out they were still together after he cheated.\n\nI confronted her about this, I asked her first why she felt the need to flirt with her ex and if she had any feelings for him. Her explanation was that she simply wanted to mess with him, by giving him hope that he could get her back, as revenge for him cheating on her. I asked her why she didnt tell me at the time and she told me she didn't want me to think of her as a petty psycho, and then she just forgot to tell me.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do, I love her more than anything and I know she does too, or atleast I thought so. The thought of being a second option to her, or the nice guy she uses to get over her ex is revolting, and if that's the case I want to cut her off immediately. I honestly don't know what to believe. Please help me.\n\ntldr: gf texted ex saying she misses him and flirted with him months into our relationship",

This has also been fuelling my anxiety even though I can‚Äôt wait until we do.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I are in a great relationship, he doesn‚Äôt mind that we don‚Äôt have sex as often but I love how happy he gets when I say we can do it so I kinda force my body to get turned on sorta.\n\nThe issue is that my family is strict and doesn‚Äôt know about him, we can only meet up at certain times and I can‚Äôt bring my phone or anything because I‚Äôm tracked by my family. We also don‚Äôt have enough time to drive to his house because he lives in the town over. His family knows about me and loves me, they‚Äôre very chill with my boyfriend and make jokes about making sure he wears a condom etc. (which I enjoy because I don‚Äôt get to laugh about those things with my family)\n\nThis all leads us to one option pretty much, parking lots. Which was also great because I‚Äôm a jeep girl (he has an old ass jeep) and I always made jokes about how doing it in the back of a jeep was on my bucket list. This used to get me in the mood even more. We even have a tarp to cover the windows with. However it all went downhill in January when him and I were being pretty wholesome. A coo pulled up in front of us and questioned us about doing drugs. (We both hate drugs and don‚Äôt befriend anyone who uses) We didn‚Äôt get any tickets or arrested but it put a paranoia in me. My parents would kill me if I got so much as a speeding ticket, getting arrested for hanging out with my boyfriend would make them even more furious.\n\nSince then I stopped being as intimate. I always have this fear that my parents are gonna find out and it gives me really bad anxiety. I don‚Äôt care if I get arrested for it, if anything that sounds like a great legacy to get arrested for and my boyfriend is a tradie too so he‚Äôll be praised by his coworkers for it. I do care about my parents beating me and disowning me. How can I put myself at ease and stop my worry? Any advice would be great.\n\ntldr: I have strict parents and it‚Äôs causing me to have anxiety with my relationship",

        "text": "TL;DR! : Realized after 3 years my friends have been manipulative and excluding me.\n\nIn resume, I had many issues making friends while growing up, specially in high school,now i am at college but i still have the feeling of insecureness attached from my school years,mostly because of things people said about me like: the things i like (music, sports, videogames), the way i dress and my sexual orientation... I met these two friends almost 3 years ago, one of them in college and the other one when I had a job, at the beginning everything was okay but when i told them the things that i was insecure about (like the ones i listed on top) everything became suffocating for me...now that I think clearly. Because of the way i dress and talked about things I like they kind of told me in their own way, that all of those things makes me a lesbian, i know it's not bad but i couldn't help but feel like they were trying to push me into it... i let it slip and i continued telling myself that that is who I am. In high school, i had only been on dates with boys but I never fell in love which is what caused me my confusion... (still kissing them felt nice!).\n A couple of months ago i made a friend on Twitter, she was really nice and we had a lot of things in common,we talked everyday, of course I told my other two friends about the new friend I had...one day it was with them talking and drinking and they saw the messages I had with my friend of Twitter, apparently and according to them, she was interested in me which in my opinion, she was only being nice and that's the vibe i got, i honestly didn't want to read into it that much... they told me that i should try to \"flirt\" with her, at that moment I felt tipsy and agreed, since i don't know much about that, they took my phone and started to message her the majority of things... when the next day arrived and I read the messages again I couldn't help but feel guilty and disgusted with myself because: 1) I didn't want to confuse my friend and 2) I allowed that to happen. \nThat whole day I had anxiety and I felt nauseous, it was kind of like a \"wake up call\" I realized that these 3 years I have been living afraid, way more insecure and confused... and more than ever...forcing things that I feel I am not. Whenever I made a comment about a guy in college that i thought it was handsome one of my friends always made this \"disagreement face\" and in my head it was \"wrong\" to think of boys like that.\n These past few days, I decided to stop talking to them and cut them out. I been feeling more calmed, the anxiety also has been decreasing and i feel better.\nSadly, I had to do that with my Twitter friend also and of course I apologized to her for things getting confusing...she understood everything and we stopped talking a few days ago,I still feel guilty and of course I miss talking to her since she was really nice and respectful but I can't help but feel like the friendship was ruined by them. I deleted my account also since I had the feeling it was consuming me and it was also my mechanism of defense to stop my anxiety.\n\nNow I have to ask: What do I do if these two friends try to get back into my life? How can I set boundaries from manipulative people like them? And what advice could I get from the whole Twitter friend situation? Should I go back to talk to her?\n\nThanks for reading!! I just needed to let it all out.",

        "text": "I am a 25F and had been seeing a 24M. We met at work 2 years ago and have had sort of a rocky situationship. He‚Äôs also had a girlfriend he‚Äôs been on and off with the last 6 years that he so called claims he‚Äôs miserable with and only stays with her because he‚Äôs too comfortable. \n\nOver the last two years we have talked practically everyday, he‚Äôs become a good friend of mine even though I caught feelings. Even though he verbally said to me face ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything serious with you and I don‚Äôt want you to catch feelings.‚Äù He knew he had a pull on me and that I was putty in his hands. We hooked up twice in the beginning when his and said gf were ‚Äúoff‚Äù. A lot of time had passed and I started to fall back and I guess he noticed that and started giving me more attention, he told me he apologizes so much for how he treated me, he loves me more then I‚Äôll ever know, he‚Äôs never had someone care about me the way I have, he wishes he could be with me, etc.\n\nOver the last month I hooked up with him twice because of course him and this girl had broken up again. FUN FACT ABOUT ME: I HAVE CRIPPLING ANXIETY/HYPOCONDRIA. Stds are truly one of my biggest fears. He is the only person in 2 years I have slept unprotected with, 1 other person with protection. I get checked frequently and everything is always good. \n\nI go to my std screening for a rapid test and I came back positive for THREE curable stds. Me being the hypochondriac I am; I HOUNDED this guy about who he‚Äôs been with, what he‚Äôs done, i also threatened to show up at his house because he wasn‚Äôt answering me. I made him go get tested and harassed him and went to the strip clubs he went to recently to see if he hooked up with strippers, for the 4 days waiting for his results and they were all negative‚Ä¶we got into a fight again because I wanted him to send me dates and screenshots of the tests and I told him I‚Äôm getting retested and I‚Äôll send him my results and he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care anymore we can‚Äôt talk or anything like that anymore I‚Äôm done with you‚Äù at this point I‚Äôm so confused on what is going on and I decided to actually do a send out lab test myself, 3 days later all my tests came back negative as well. I was so eager to show him that I never actually had anything, and something had to be mixed up or faulty. I sent it to him and I basically said ‚Äú I just wanted to show you that I was clean and never had anything this entire time. I won‚Äôt contact you again I just wanted you to know that this all happened because of nothing and I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù All he replied was ‚Äúthank you‚Äù\n\nI haven‚Äôt eaten much food in about a week, I‚Äôve lost 10 pounds nearly, I dream about him every night because I miss him so much and I really wish I didn‚Äôt lose him in my life over some thing that was actually nothing but the way my hypochondria is I couldn‚Äôt help but react the way I did, especially because that has never happened to me before. We worked together and I noticed he‚Äôs been dropping shifts and I really wish I didn‚Äôt have the mentality that he‚Äôs avoiding me. I truly do love and care for this guy and I just want some advice or opinions if you think he will ever come back around. This is the most depressed I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life. Someone please give me advice on if you think he‚Äôd come back eventually or if you think he is actually done because my heart is literally breaking. I know I may have seemed crazy, but I feel like I had a reason to react the way I did given the circumstances.\n\nTLDR: If you had been seeing someone the last two years with unprotected sex and ‚Äúmagically‚Äù come up with 3 false positive curable std results. Would you cut off ties with the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù person because of the way they reacted to finding out that news if they questioned you/harassed you repeatedly about your actions if you were the only person they had been with unprotected in this time KNOWING they have hypochondria?",

        "text": "We‚Äôve been together 5 years. We have 3 kids. He is loyal &amp; he shares an equal load with the kids. But I feel like he doesn‚Äôt like me. He is definitely attracted to me but he doesn‚Äôt treat me with any respect. He always acts like I‚Äôm naive and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good for me. He speaks rudely to me and financially controls everything while criticizing any and every purchase I make, even groceries. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom and he says all the money is his and the house is his. I get nervous to ask him for basic necessities. Any food or activity choices I make are wrong and I have bad taste. But when I bring this up he tells me of course he loves me and he‚Äôs just stressed bc of money. (We‚Äôre poor) He even started therapy. But he‚Äôs still being mean.   Examples: If I suggest a restaurant he always thinks it‚Äôs stupid or gross. If I buy a food I like at the grocery store he thinks he could‚Äôve made a better purchase or I don‚Äôt need it and me and the kids need to eat healthier.  If I ask him to grab me a glass of water even after sex it annoys him so much. I feel like I have to be totally independent or he gets annoyed. Never compliments me or says anything kind but when I bring it up he says I‚Äôm so hot or something and of course he loves me.   Yells at me in front of our kids. Tells me I‚Äôm stupid and make bad choices. I‚Äôm immature. And lazy. Doesn‚Äôt build me up but expects failure. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable trying any new hobbies or skills in front of him because he just laughs like I‚Äôm so cute. I couldn‚Äôt possibly be good at anything or succeed. And when we‚Äôre in public I feel like his 4th kid. He doesn‚Äôt Macy proud to be with me at all.  But he‚Äôs also been with me through really hard times and supported me. I have BPD so I second guess myself but I just don‚Äôt know what to do cause I feel like my self esteem is being destroyed.\n\nTL;DR : Is my boyfriend mean or is it my BPD?",

        "text": "I (29 F) met a guy (29 M) on a dating app and started to talk online. We live in different countries and both have different careers going on. \nWe really hit it off instantly, we have the same background ( Ethnicity , culture, religious, political , romantic ) but we kept it casual as we are far from each other. We wanted to take it slow , by getting to know each other and started as friends. at the beginning he was very enthusiastic about talking and getting to know each other , he added me on social media and he was a bit flirtatious but nothing over the limit. He introduced me to his sister and we became friends on a deep level . He shared his personal life and we got close over the first 3 months of talking. he wanted to know everything about my life , family , job. He discussed the possibility of meeting up. He has all the green flags a girl can ask for. I know for a fact that he was impressed of me.\n\nSuddenly he stopped talking without any reason. No fights or disagreements. \nI matched his energy and sent a msg once to check on him but he never replied and he kept me on social media . During this time He kept sending me videos but never send a personal msg to me explaining why did he stop talking . He stopped watching my stories and commenting on my posts. He even stopped posting and disappeared but Every few days he sends me things funny to watch. Recently I really thought I must move on and think of myself . It is like he felt me moving on and he started to post things, watching my stories, hinting things on still being single , that he has things going on in his life . I know he had some issue in his family and i know i must be not a priority in his life at this level of life but I know there is a connection still there between us. What should I do ? I have already moved on but I feel his energy is still surrounding me . I know for sure that he is nervous of me moving on. Why would he keep me around ? I am no drama or clingy but I miss him a lot. \n\nTLDR : My guy friend (33M) ghosted me  (31F) and I think I have feelings for him.",

        "text": "Okay, so while the title of this is accurate, I know it's wrong. I'm looking for advice on how to address these emotions and I acknowledge that a lacking relationship with my mom makes my partner's relationship hurt me in ways that it honestly shouldn't. \nI am 23F, he is 25M, we have been dating for 3 years and lived together for 1.5 ish. Recently moved to a new city together. \n\nSETTING: My boyfriend/domestic partner's mom is in town for 5 days. His dad wasn't in the picture and they are incredibly close. Their personalities are almost exactly alike and they have their own language talking to each other. It's amazing, frankly. I'm the oops baby and 4th child of my parents who are older than BFs grandparents. We aren't close. \n\nBACKGROUND/ CAN SKIP: My partner is not very affectionate. He doesn't have a love language that he knows of. I received love through physical touch and I've learned that he has a \"battery\" or sorts where I can only hug him a certain number of times per day and honestly hold his attention for a certain amount of time. He is not interested in most of the things I am (like plants, books, art, outdoors, motorcycling...) But he listens and we do have areas where we connect like anime. \n\nEXAMPLE: This has been happening the whole trip but I will use yesterday night as an example. He announced to me that they were going out for oysters as an appetizer to the dinner we had planned. I was cool with that and said let me know when you want to pick me up for dinner. He informed me they decided to stay at the oyster place for dinner. They were gone for 5 hours. I went and got dinner myself and I told myself I was cool with it. They come back and are jolly. They ignore me and talk to each other about how fun their night was and saying how crazy it is that people come up to them and tell them it looks like they are having fun. Every time I asked how was the food, or asked for details on their story, they would turn to me like I disturbed them. I'm sure they didn't mean that. They just didn't want to pause their jovialness to include me in it. I realized this and said I was tired and went to bed. \nPartner came in for bed and I was clearly still awake. He just started watching a show on his phone and just said gave me one word answers when I asked him how his day was. So he's tired, that's okay. This morning, we woke up and he immediately went out to the living room where his mom is sleeping and started talking to her again. \n\nSUMMARY: Like, it's fine. They're close and that's lovely. They travel to see each other every month to two months. That's great. But why does it feel like I completely lose my partner when she's here? I get 0 affection and he completely changes when he's with her. They have references I don't understand at all. We will be talking for 10 minutes about something serious and I find out they they've been joking the whole time. He initiates hugs with her which he acts like are a chore with me. I am more upbeat than they are and they look at me as if I'm annoying. \nI know it's not about me. Of course it's not. If I could have a relationship with my mom like that I would love it and treasure it. But how am I supposed to feel when my partner just takes a vacation from me while I am sleeping right next to him? When he's visiting her I get maybe one or two texts a day. That's fine! Visit with your mom! But when it's in my house and I feel like I'm invading on every conversation had at my own dinner table? I completely lose my partner and he acts in a way where I feel like I don't know him at all? How do it deal with this? \n\n\nTL;DR: my parenter changes when his mom is staying with us and they exclude me from meals, conversations and activities we have planned to do together.",

        "text": "My sister and I have a normal teenage sibling relationship. We hang out, we laugh, we fight etc. \n\nShe's been dating her boyfriend for about nine months, and I get along fine with him too. We watch soccer together sometimes and he once helped me out at school a few weeks ago when this other kid was bullying me. He's stronger than most people our age, so him having my back was useful.  \n\nAnyway, this weekend the three of us were at our home alone because my parents were away. Her boyfriend stayed over the two nights (our parents were fine with it).\n\nThink we'd just spent a heck of a lot of time together and my sister and I fought over something pretty stupid on Saturday afternoon. I knocked her phone out of her hands and it fell and got a crack on it and she just complained incessantly about it. I said sorry once but then got annoyed and kept saying it was no big deal and I didn't care. And when she went on about it I looked at her boyfriend and said in an exasperated voice \"If you keep your pimp hand strong she'd be in line a lot more.\"\n\nThe words barely left my mouth that he slapped me extremely sharply on the face. I could feel my left cheek burning and it felt extremely shaming. I sat down quietly and none of us said anything for the next 10 minutes and then I went to my room. \n\nThat night we were going to a house party and though we all went it felt quite awkward. After he left today I mentioned it to my sister and she told me she wasn't talking to me, and that she \"fully, 100% agreed with what he did\". And that if he hadn't, she would have been the one to slap me. \n\nNo one has ever struck me, not even our parents, and absolutely never on the face. I love my sister and I also like her boyfriend, but how can I move past this if I don't get an apology? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I made a sexist joke at my sister's expense to her boyfriend, and he hit me on the face, which she supports.",

We also don‚Äôt have enough time to drive to his house because he lives in the town over. His family knows about me and loves me, they‚Äôre very chill with my boyfriend and make jokes about making sure he wears a condom etc. (which I enjoy because I don‚Äôt get to laugh about those things with my family)\n\nThis all leads us to one option pretty much, parking lots. Which was also great because I‚Äôm a jeep girl (he has an old ass jeep) and I always made jokes about how doing it in the back of a jeep was on my bucket list. This used to get me in the mood even more. We even have a tarp to cover the windows with. However it all went downhill in January when him and I were being pretty wholesome. A coo pulled up in front of us and questioned us about doing drugs. (We both hate drugs and don‚Äôt befriend anyone who uses) We didn‚Äôt get any tickets or arrested but it put a paranoia in me. My parents would kill me if I got so much as a speeding ticket, getting arrested for hanging out with my boyfriend would make them even more furious.\n\nSince then I stopped being as intimate. I always have this fear that my parents are gonna find out and it gives me really bad anxiety. I don‚Äôt care if I get arrested for it, if anything that sounds like a great legacy to get arrested for and my boyfriend is a tradie too so he‚Äôll be praised by his coworkers for it. I do care about my parents beating me and disowning me. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to put my mind at ease.

        "text": "Throwaway.\n\nThe title is blunt but in essence it's true. I am a gay woman who finally got the confidence to come out at the age of 40 after my mother died. Once I came out, I soon started dating this amazing woman (let's call her Ellis). It's been 2 years and we just got engaged last month.\n\nDuring the course of the relationship, I met her family and they were all so wonderful and supportive of us. Luckily, the family I have left are really supportive as well, but had my mother been alive I can guarantee I would not even have had the courage to come out. My late mother was a control freak my whole life, intensely religious and homophobic to the point where she would regularly join her church's public protests against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nA few months into our relationship, Ellis asked me about my mom. And I just lied. I lied about how my mom was such a wonderful person and how much she would have loved Ellis. I regularly made up these sweet stories about her to the point where Ellis expressed regret that she never got to meet her, and even wants to keep an empty chair dedicated to my mom at our wedding. Ellis also wants me to mention her during our vows in order to honor her memory.\n\nI am honestly not sure why I didn't just tell Ellis the truth to begin with. I think I was just so insecure knowing that my mother would have absolutely disowned me had she been alive.\n\nI just feel disgusting for being dishonest to my future wife, but I don't see how I can come clean to her now. She has this persona of my mother in her mind, and saying I just made the whole thing up would sound horrible. I also feel that in a way, lying about who my mother really was has messed with my mind, because my real memories of her vs the ones I have been making up to make her seem like some wonderful person are so different.\n\nI am so afraid that if we mention her or save a seat for her during her wedding, my relatives and siblings will question it because they know my mother's true nature. And then my fiancee will find out, which is my worst nightmare. How do I deal with this situation?\n\nTL;DR: Came out as a gay woman after my toxic, homophobic mother passed away. I started dating a woman, but I became insecure and began lying to her about my mother's true nature, making her believe she would have loved her had she been alive. Now my fiancee wants to make a tribute for her at our wedding but I am uncomfortable with that and also worried that my relatives might question it because they knew who my mom was. I don't know what to do now.",

Also, I wasn't allowed to stay sitting for more than a couple of hours.

All of these relationships have been the same for me and its that I forget about myself and try to not feel lonely by trying to fill this loneliness void.. Since I have been in therapy I have been working on filling that void with affirmations/reassuring myself I‚Äôm not alone, being very picky who I let inside my inner circle and appreciating myself and doing more things alone to not be so obsessed with the idea of being with someone 24/7 and its been like this for 2 months and i love it. I haven‚Äôt used bumble at all and im doing super good!\n\nOn Friday I added some guy on LinkedIn and he began talking to me and basically asked me for my number and tell me he is interested in meeting up and I just was not interested and I told him that im not ready for a relationship because I really I‚Äôm not. Is it wrong to feel not ready even when you get attention thrown on you ? . I dont feel like i want to start trying to explore not for another year‚Ä¶ Any advice\n\n\nTl;dr not feeling ready for a relationship after using men to fill a void of loneliness. Now that I im content with myself I can‚Äôt wrap my mind around getting to know someone..",

        "text": "TLDR: my (32F) boyfriend (34M)wants to donate his sperm for money after being together for 3 years. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm interested in continuing the relationship if he does. \n\nMe (32) and my partner (34) have been together for over three years. He is a freelancer and had a span of 6 months where he wasn‚Äôt working. During that time he was looking for ways to make money and came across sperm donation. He started the process while I was away for school and kept telling me he wouldn‚Äôt be accepted. Fast forward two months and all of his samples have past. He is just waiting for a psych eval and then will be able to move forward with the donation. He will have to donate 3 times a week for 6 months. He is now currently working and therefore has an income. I also make enough money to support us. It really makes me feel some type of way as we are supposed to be starting our own family in the near future. It‚Äôs just a weird thought that he will have other children out there who may come forward when they turn 18 (the children are given the info of their sperm donor if requested). If he is donating 3 times per week this could be a lot of children. Not technically his but still a piece of him walking around and potentially looking for him when they turn 18. I have nothing against sperm donation I know for those who can‚Äôt conceive it is needed. I just don‚Äôt understand why you feel the need to do it after you‚Äôve been in a serious relationship for three years. Am I wrong for not wanting him to do it? I realize it is his body so I haven‚Äôt directly told him not to I have just said I don‚Äôt know what it will do to our relationship if he goes through with it.",

I got really annoyed and blocked him but I didn‚Äôt remove his number so he texted me a loooot until I finally gave him another chance a few months ago.\n\n He‚Äôs also too airy.

        "text": "TL;DR My partner has grown increasingly depressed and is acting like I‚Äôm an annoyance to their life. I‚Äôm trying to help save this relationship but I don‚Äôt know if I can. \n\nWe fell in love instantly November of 2021, and had a really great relationship for about 2 years. They would do literally anything to make me happy. Made a surprise trip for my birthday, would take me out, would come do things with me, they joined my billiards team. I had my moments of causing issues‚ÄîI have BPD and enjoy drinking. The issues didn‚Äôt happen very often but when they did happen, we could always communicate and they were very good to work with my moods. \n\nWe got our first place together (first apartment for the both of us ever)‚Äîand made a joint savings account, we‚Äôve saved for stuff like being able to get our cars fixed and just general adult things neither of us had really done before. We built a life together, they love my cat, I felt like I had it really good for a bit. \n\nFairly recently, things have started to go downhill. It started with them getting angry at little things. Like road rage or me asking them to pick up their trash. I don‚Äôt do well with anger, I get legitimately scared when someone raises their voice or throws things around and I‚Äôve told them that. The outbursts haven‚Äôt been happening as often as they were, but still sometimes. \n\nI then noticed they didn‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. No more going out to dinner, no dates, none of the things we would do together (pool, longboarding, make music etc). We used to have friends come over on Fridays and they cancelled those and also quit the billiards team. \n\nThey started to get very distant. They started to only send one word replies, not really talk to me at home‚Äîthey just want to play video games. They had told me in the past, their lowest point when they were super depressed was when they did nothing but play video games. \n\nI am aware that they are depressed. I have tried to talk to them about things, but it turns into a fight. They say their pushing me away so they don‚Äôt hurt me because that‚Äôs all they think they‚Äôre good for. They say they don‚Äôt know what they want or who they are and that they‚Äôre just angry and miserable. They‚Äôll have moments of happy and apologize for how terrible they‚Äôve been and then go right back to being cold to me. The only time I see them act happy is with their best friend. I asked why they can have fun with their friend but not with me, and they couldn‚Äôt really give me a good answer. That I get the worst of it because we‚Äôre together all the time (studio apartment with no privacy).\n\nThey act like they want nothing to do with me. Like actively hating me‚ÄîI can tell when I touch them they don‚Äôt wanna be touched by me, when I say I love you it‚Äôs too annoying for them to say it back with any real meaning (unless they have the moment where they come back to their senses and are very regretful).\n\nThey have said when things get hard someone leaves them or they leave. I told them I want to work on this together because they were there for me when I was low. But I just can‚Äôt handle feeling like everything is my fault and that I‚Äôm having to beg for love, which I‚Äôve only done one other time and it sent me to the mental hospital. I have tried doing all the chores so they have nothing to do, I‚Äôve tried to give space, I‚Äôve tried to talk, I‚Äôm at a loss. They act like they really don‚Äôt wanna be with me but then tell me that they love me.\n\nThey just signed up for their work health insurance and they‚Äôre going to see a therapist, but that could be months. \n\nAt the moment, I have a time limit. If nothing has changed by summer time, I guess I‚Äôm gone. Advice?",

I on the other hand found myself a job and this year marks my first year being employed. We are both in the creative industry so I know how job hunting can go.\n\nThat being said, we have two very distinct ways on how we view career paths. I was raised to get a job as soon as I am done studying so that I can not only earn money but pay bills. She on the other hand believes to wait for a good opportunity first and then work on personal projects in the meantime. I told her that what I say regarding her finding a job should not matter because she should do it for herself, and besides, I will be here to support her no matter what.\n\nThis has caused us to butt heads quite a lot recently, I told her that I did not want her to be comfortable in not finding work as I know she always talks about all the things she can get once she gets paid. Once she puts her mind on something she really works well and it is inspiring to me at how driven she is in this regard. My comment on her finding a job backfired, she took it that I thought she is lazy and a bum because she is not employed yet even-though she has been looking around.\n\nShe now sees herself as being inferior to me despite me telling her otherwise, she is just not listening to me. It has gotten to the point where she wants to break up because she believes that since I am employed, I no longer want to support her in her dreams and aspirations. I reassured her that is not the case, but she says that she still gets that vibe from me even-though I say that.\n\nI really do not know what to do. To me it feels like she has jumped to her own conclusion of it and now won't see past it, it's like she believes she is inferior and is now reiterating it to me, even-though that is false. She does struggle with low self esteem at times, but I just want to support her even if it's not something I would do.\n\nWhat can I do in this situation to reassure her that despite what she does, I am here for her?\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend believes that ever since I got a job, I view her as being inferior to me.",
