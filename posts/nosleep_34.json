        "text": "\nI.\n\n\nI’m pretty sure my mom’s boyfriend died before we moved into the house. \n\nLook, I know it’s crazy, and I have never been one to believe in the supernatural.\n\nBut how else could you explain what happened after we moved in? What other possible explanation could there be besides me going insane?\n\nNo, I am positive that Brice is dead, and I’m only telling you this now because I don’t know what to do. \n\nMy mother refuses to talk about it, and I can’t blame her, but it is so lonely holding everything in, and I can’t do it anymore. \n\nMom divorced my father when I was two, and in my 22 years alive, I could count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him. \n\nHe doesn’t matter, though; I have never lacked love. Mom is my best friend, and we do everything together.\n\nWhen she started dating Brice, I was happy for her and relieved that she was finally with somebody who treated her well.\n\nI was even happy when Brice invited mom and me to live with him after he inherited his mother’s estate.\n\nThe house was in the country on a vast, lonely plot of land, and the entire ride there, mom chatted happily.\n\n“He’s been working on it every day for months. Oh, it’s going to be great, Samara. It’s huge, and there’s so much we can do. The only downside, he says, is that there are many bugs, but an exterminator will be out soon to deal with them. He has it under control for now. Isn’t this just great?”\n\nI nodded at the right places and made noises of approval. \n\nThe positivity in me died when we pulled into the gravel driveway. \n\nIf I had to describe the house in one word, it would be run down.\n\nIt was a shambling, three-story that looked like it was held together by spit and prayer.  Shingles were missing, and the paint was peeling. The windows were big and black and reminded me of eye sockets. \n\nThe yard was overgrown with weeds and choked with relics of the past: a rusty tricycle, an old tire swing, and baby dolls bleached by the sun. When I kicked one, its face cracked open, and a stream of bugs scurried out. Ugh.\n\nAs cliche as this sounds, it was a house straight out of a horror movie. \n\nI didn’t let what I thought show on my face because mom was ecstatic. \n\nShe called it charming, and I mirrored her, but inwardly I thought that nothing about this house exuded charm. \n\nI was being a brat, and I reminded myself that this was only temporary. I had just graduated from college, and so far, looking for a job had been exhausting and demoralizing.  The prices of apartments made me want to cry.\n\nThe front door opened, and Brice emerged from the house’s dark.  He has always been pale, especially in contrast to my and my mom’s dark brown skin, but he looked paler than I have ever seen. He looked sick, and I stared at the angry red bumps circling his neck.\n\nHe caught me looking and smiled, and I smiled back weakly. \n\nI didn’t like Brice. \n\nHe has always been kind to mom and me and has done nothing offensive. \n\nHe never made me feel unwanted as my father did and mom loved him. I have never seen her this happy.\n\nI suppose I was jealous of him. For years I had been the only recipient of mom’s love, and now I was to share her with this strange man.\n\nHis eyes were ice blue, devoid of emotion, and when he smiled, it was cold and predatory like a shark’s.\n\nHe led us inside to give us a tour, and it surprised me that the interior was starkly different from the outside.\n\nIt was beautiful, with arched windows and slanting high ceilings. The dark floorboards gleamed, and the rooms were impeccably furnished with pristine vintage furniture.\n\nI gawked, and Brice laughed at my expression.\n\n“Surprising, right? I know the outside looks a mess. After mother got sick, she couldn’t keep up with it. Come on, let’s see your room.”\n\nWe climbed those elegant stairs, and the second floor was just as lovely. My room was airy and bright and smelled like fresh paint. The walls were my favorite color, sage green, and a large canopy bed was in the center, surrounded by moving boxes.\n\n“I thought you’d want to put your things exactly where you wanted,” Brice said from behind me. \n\nI turned around, and he was smiling. \n\n“Isn’t it great, Samara?” Mom said, beaming. “Didn’t he do a great job?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, and I smiled. “Thank you, Brice. It’s amazing.”\n\nHe said nothing; he just kept smiling. His teeth were white and very sharp.\n\n❧\n\nWe spent the rest of the day unpacking. The largeness of the house seemed to swallow mom’s and my meager belongings.\n\nIt was hot, and the stairs left us winded.\n\nAround six, mom and Brice went to pick up pizza, and I roamed the house. \n\nThe second floor had four bedrooms; Mom and Brice’s was diagonal from mine. The last, Brice told us, led to the third floor.  Its door was painted black with an intricate silver door knob.\n\n“Mother used it as an attic.” He explained. “Nobody has been up there in years.”\n\nI wanted to ask why, but before I could, Brice steered us away. \n\nWell, he’s not here now, is he? I thought. My heart beat fast in anticipation, and I grabbed the silver doorknob and turned it slowly.\n\nIt was locked.\n\n“Fuck,” I whispered to myself. I jiggled it in vain, but the door stayed locked, and shrugging, I went downstairs to wait for the food.\n\n❧\n\nI had a weird dream that night.\n\nI dreamt I was walking around the house, a golden light flooding the rooms. \n\nI floated up the winding stairs, my toes brushing the floor. I headed towards the black door, and when I grasped the doorknob, it disintegrated in my hand. \n\nDarkness billowed out of the room like a cloud. It extinguished all light, and when I blinked, I was on the third floor.\n\nIt was as big as a ballroom and empty and dark. The room shook violently, and I struggled to stay upright.\n\nThe walls pulsed red and cast tall contorting shadows. They bent and danced and twisted into impossible shapes, and I watched l as they beckoned to me. They coyly teased me.\n\nThe color washed over me like a crimson wave, and something hot and wet dripped out of my ear.\n\nI touched it, and my fingers came away slick with blood. My blood hardened and shimmered on my skin before drifting away like fireflies.\n\nThey vanished into the dark, and I followed them. \n\nThere had to be hundreds of them suspended in the air. Fairy lights, I thought, made up of blood.\n\nI reached out to touch one and cried out when I made contact. \n\nThe little fucker had burned me!\n\nMy eyes pricked with tears of pain. \n\n“Wake up,” I whispered to myself. “Wake up.” \n\nI did all the usual stuff when I wanted to wake up from a dream. I slapped my face and pinched my skin, but nothing happened. \n\nI didn’t know what else to do, so I kept walking. My heart beat louder with each step, staccato drumming inside my chest.\n\nSomebody was standing in front of me. I could hear slow, ragged breathing.\n\nMy arms prickled in gooseflesh, and my mouth went dry.\n\nThe room was red now, and Brice stood in front of me.\n\nHis skin was clammy and gray, and his neck lolled onto his chest. His arms hung limply at his sides. He reminded me of a marionette whose strings had been cut.\n\nBefore I could stop myself, I reached out to touch him, but he grabbed me first. His hand encircled my wrist.\n\nI watched, terrified, as he slowly lifted his head and gazed at me with milky-white eyes.\n\nHis mouth fell open as he emitted a low, rattling croak. He jerked his head, his neck making sick, crunching noises.\n\nHe shook. His entire body trembled. His mouth opened wide, and he vomited a stream of black beetles. \n\nI wanted to run, but my feet were glued to the floor; the bugs crawled toward me and clung to my skin. I screamed, and they crawled into my mouth and down my throat. I couldn’t breathe. I was dying. Please not like this.\n\nI woke up gasping and gagging, and I clutched my throat. \n\nI could still feel bugs inside of me, and my stomach roiled. I ran to the bathroom and vomited until I felt empty and brushed my teeth until I felt clean. \n\nI didn’t think I could go back to sleep, but I did.\n\nThankfully, I didn’t dream.\n\n❧\n\nBreakfast was quiet. Mom hummed while she cooked and outlined her plans for the day. Brice and I silently played with our bowls of oatmeal. I was thinking about my dream, and Brice looked even worse today. \n\nThe rash on his neck had darkened to a deep crimson and spread down his fingertips and halfway up his face. He scratched at it until the skin broke and bled.\n\nI watched as droplets of blood dripped onto his oatmeal. \n\n“Brice!” Mom said in alarm. She had finally gotten a good look at him.\n\n“Honey, are you having an allergic reaction to something? Did you get bitten by a bug?”\n\nBrice shook his head and tried to smile reassuringly at her.  His eyes were glassy and bloodshot red, and with his gray-tinged skin, he looked like the undead. \n\n“I’m fine; I’m okay. \n\nMom ignored him. She was in nurse mode now. She wanted to take him to the hospital at once.\n\nBrice shook his head. “No,” he gasped. “No hospital.”\n\n“But hon-“ mom started, but Brice shook his head again.\n\n“I’m fine, Ana. I am. I’ll take some Benadryl and rest for a little while. I feel worn out today.” He stood unsteadily and kissed mom on the cheek. \n\nShe watched him leave, and her brow furrowed in worry. \n\n“I’ll be right there!” She called. “Try not to scratch so much.”\n\nShe turned her concern on me.\n\n“How do you feel? Are you alright? No bug bites anywhere?”\n\n“No,” I said, chewing a mouthful of oatmeal. “I feel fine.”\n\nMom looked at me and began clearing the table and washing the dishes.\n\n“Do you mind helping me a bit with unpacking? We only have a few boxes left.” She said over the sound of running water.\n\nI nodded. “Sure, no problem.”\n\n“I’m going to check on Brice, and then we’ll get started.” She hurried up and disappeared to the second floor. \n\nI finished the dishes and remembered Brice’s bowl on the kitchen table.\n\nI stirred it with a spoon and watched as the mushy oatmeal turned pink, and then I put the spoon to my lips and ate it all.\n\n❧\n\nThe door opened for me this time. \n\nAfter mom and I had finished unpacking, she went to take care of Brice.\n\nI could hear them quietly arguing as I walked by their closed bedroom door. I could make out one word: hospital. Brice still didn’t want to go.\n\nI thought about his rash and my dream and the black door with the silver doorknob.\n\nI wondered if it would open as it had in my dream.\n\nWould I want it to? Yes.\n\nDid I want to go to my room and face rejection emails and send off more job applications? No.\n\nWell, it was decided then.\n\nI didn’t tiptoe down the hallway, but I crept as quietly as possible. The black door looked bigger than I remembered, and its knob gleamed.\n\nSunlight streamed from the large bay windows, and I noticed the doorknob was in the shape of a flower, every petal delicately engraved.\n\nI twisted it with sweaty hands, and as it opened, my heart pounded. I walked up the stairs.\n\nIt looked exactly as it had in my dream, only cluttered. There were white sheets draped over furniture; that looked like misshapen ghosts, a grandfather clock whose hour and minute hands were stuck on twelve, boxes labeled in illegible script, a beautiful ornate mirror, a record player placed on a dark brown desk, and even an elegant chandelier that still looked pristine. \n\nThere was also dust, a lot. I had a sneezing fit, and I watched as it swirled in the air, sparkling in the sunlight. \n\nI walked around, inspecting every item. It reminded me of a consignment store. Why was all of this still here? Yes, they were old and dirty, but they were intact, and some Lysol would help. \n\nI want, I thought, my stomach fluttering; I want all of it, even the chandelier.\n\nThe thought surprised me because I have never coveted objects, but I could put them to use. They wouldn’t have to stay here gathering dust with nobody to appreciate them.\n\nIt was the mirror I wanted the most. That beautiful floor-length mirror called to me from the other side of the room. \n\nIt drew me to its beauty, and as I walked closer, the sun began setting, turning the sky orange.\n\nShadows crept onto the walls; they were tall with long, crooked fingers. They beckoned me, but I didn’t react. I only had eyes for the mirror.\n\nI stared at myself, and my reflection stared back. There was a spiderweb in my dreadlocks, and still staring, I plucked it out. The net wrapped around my thumb, turning into thin strands of gold and silver. It pulsed on my skin and grew tighter until it dissolved inside me.\n\nSounds were coming from the mirror, laughter, talking, and the clinking of glasses—the din of a get-together or a party. \n\nI reached for that mirror, stretching my fingers toward my reflection, and its surface rippled like waves as I brushed it.\n\nThis was a bad idea. This was a terrible idea, but I couldn’t stop; I plunged my hand in, and something grabbed my wrist. \n\nIt pulled me into the mirror, and I fought back as hard as possible. My arm was halfway through the glass. It felt like pins and needles were being dragged along my skin.  It kept pulling me until my face was inches away from the mirror. \n\nI am going to fall through the looking glass, I thought giddily. Down the rabbit hole I go.\n\nI wanted to close my eyes, but the mirror shimmered in the most beautiful of colors, Some I had never seen before. \n\nI saw her; a woman was staring at me from inside the mirror. Her face was trapped in a whirlpool of color, and she smiled, revealing broken yellow teeth.\n\nHer eyes were black, and her skin was white as snow. She gazed hungrily at me and tightened her grip so hard that I thought she would tear my arm off. \n\n“I have you,” she whispered. “I have you.”\n\nShe caressed my cheek with one long claw and then dug it into the skin.\n\n“Samara!” Mom’s voice made me stagger backward. The woman, startled, let go, and I fell on my ass, sending a cloud of dust in the air. I watched as she sank back into the mirror, its surface rippling. \n\n“Samara!” Mom called again, and for the first time, I was happy that she had never learned how to use her indoor voice. \n\nI bolted down the stairs, not caring how much noise I was making. I made sure the door was closed shut behind me. My heart felt as though it would burst out of my chest. I took a second to catch my breath and then went to find out what Mom wanted. \n\nMom and Brice’s door was open. As I walked by, I couldn’t help but peek in. \n\nBrice lay on his back, sleeping. I could hear his snores from here.\n\nI went to close the door and then stopped.\n\nI watched as a large brown bug crawled out of Brice’s open mouth and burrowed itself into his nostril.\n\n❧\n\n\n\nBrice didn’t feel better the next day or the day after that. When the weekend came and when he remained immobile in bed, Mom, fed up, ignored his protests and took him to the hospital.\n\nHe stayed for a day, and then they sent him home with an antihistamine and a potent antibiotic cream.\n\nMom told me it was an allergic reaction, but she didn’t look convinced, and I wasn’t either.\n\nMom had missed a week of work watching over Brice. She didn’t want to go, but with Brice sick and me still jobless, she needed every hour she could get.\n\nShe was a nurse at the local hospital, the one she had taken Brice to, and often worked doubles.\n\nThat meant while she was gone, I would take care of Brice.\n\nIt involved little, asking him if he wanted to eat or needed more water, to which he always replied no.\n\nI don’t remember the last time he had eaten. I don’t know the last time I saw him. All our communication was through that closed door, and I refused to open it, remembering the bug that had crawled out of his mouth.\n\nI was in my room struggling to put out more applications, wondering what I was doing wrong when I heard it.\n\nIt was the sound of something being dragged across the floor or the sound of somebody dragging their feet as they walked. I frowned as it grew louder and realized it was outside my door.\n\n“Brice?” I called out. “Brice, do you need something?”\n\nThere was no answer, just that slow, deliberate shuffling.\n\nIt was seven, and mom was still at work. She had called to tell me she would be at the hospital much later than she thought.\n\nThat meant I was alone in this house with Brice, and I thought of my dream, which made my stomach turn.\n\n“Brice?” I called again. “Brice, mom doesn’t think you should be out of bed.”\n\nI crossed my room, and when I yanked open my door, there was nothing. The hall was empty.\n\n“Brice?” I called again, and as usual, his bedroom door was closed. I grasped the doorknob and began to turn it when an icy hand wrapped around my wrist, and I screamed.\n\nBrice stood beside me, and he looked awful. His face was still that sickly shade of gray, tinged blue. His eyes were bloodshot red, and sweat poured down his face.\n\nThat was nothing compared to the rash on his neck. The shade of purple was so dark that it looked as if it was black. It had spread up his face and down both arms. It was a swirl of the macabre, the coloring of death.\n\nHe tried to smile at me, and the effect was ghastly. I tried not to let my discomfort or fear show, and when he let go of my wrist, I fought the urge to wipe my hand on my pants. His hand was cold and slimy.\n\n“I wouldn’t go in there,” Brice croaked, his eyes fixed on mine. “It’s a mess; I’m sorry I scared you. I was getting some water.”\n\nHe slowly shook the glass of water at me as though he needed to provide proof, and I smiled nervously at him, wanting nothing more than to run and lock myself in my room.\n\n“Okay, well, I’ll let you rest. I hope you feel better.”\n\nI hurried away, but Brice called out to me.\n\n“Samara?”\n\nI turned and met his intense stare.\n\n“I wouldn’t go up to the third floor anymore. It’s not safe.”\n\nThen he entered his bedroom; the door clicked as he locked it. I stood mystified in the hallway, wondering how he knew I had been up there and what he meant by it’s not safe.\n\n❧\n\nI don’t remember falling asleep, but I must have.\n\nI stood in the middle of a dark room lit dimly by the moon’s light.\n\nThe air was full of fat flies; they buzzed incessantly. One came close to my face, and I clapped my hands together, squashing it.\n\nI stared at the crushed mess on my palms. They glittered and turned into shards of diamonds. I watched as they floated in the air; they twinkled like stars.\n\nThere were bugs everywhere. On the walls and the floor, they coated the white sheets over the furniture, the record player, and the chandelier. \n\nOnly the mirror remained untouched by the insects. It gleamed on the other side of the room.\n\nNo, I tried to say no, but I couldn’t move my tongue or open my mouth.\n\nThe bugs formed shapes. Legs, torso, arms, head. They crowded around me in a circle, dancing and contorting. \n\nThey pulled at me and crawled on my skin. They whispered threats and panted curses. \n\nI struggled to keep my mouth closed, but I wanted to scream.\n\nStiff fingers brushed my lips; I opened my eyes and saw a familiar face peering down at me from the ceiling.\n\nThe woman from the mirror was grinning at me. Her eyes were pitch black, and her white skin absorbed the moonlight.\n\nShe hung in the air upside down, her legs dangling from gold and yellow threads made into a web. The mirror gleamed, and I saw the delicate threads trailing from it. \n\nThe web stretched across the entire room, delicately woven into intricate shapes, and on it, several large egg sacs quivered. They looked like silk body bags. \n\nThe one nearest to me shuddered and tore open, and I watched whatever it encased fall out.\n\nA leg at first, limp and pale, a hand crossed with black and purple veins, and then a bloated purple face with ice-blue eyes, staring but not seeing.\n\nIt was Brice. It was Brice’s dull but kind face looking down at me. The few strands of web encasing him gave way, and Brice’s body fell with a resounding thud. \n\nBrice was dead. Brice was very dead. His torso had burst open, exposing the inner workings of his body. \n\nHis organs were furry and black and moving, and I realized that he was full of thousands of trembling bugs. They had burst through his body after eating him from the inside out.\n\nSomething was playing with my hair, twisting fingers through my dreadlocks. The woman was still watching me, her many eyes twinkling and hungry.\n\nI haven’t forgotten you; have you forgotten me? Her gaze said. \n\nShe kept touching me, and I dimly realized that not only did she have many eyes but many arms and legs as well. She stroked my hair gently and grazed my face lovingly. \n\nShe looked like every monster I have ever imagined combined, but I didn’t feel afraid; I felt exhilarated. My heart pounded madly in my chest.\n\nShe stuck a finger between my lips and pried my mouth open. She mashed her lips against mine and breathed into me.\n\nA flood of bugs danced on my tongue, and I hungrily swallowed them all. She breathed into me, and a flood of bugs danced on my tongue, and I hungrily ate them all. \n\nThey were sweet and bitter and tickled as they glided down my throat. They coursed through my veins, crawled on my organs, and glued themselves to my rib case.\n\nThey hummed on each and every bone.",

        "text": "SMACK\n\nI can still feel the hot sting on my face while the other girls restrained me. They were all laughing at my sobs as another girl, Paige, readied her hand for another blow. She struck me with the back of her hand and one of her nails scratched my right cheek. My face was on fire and I could feel blood streaming down to my chin. My body went limp in the grasps of my captors after a few more strikes to the face. Paige took a fistful of my hair and forced my gaze onto hers.\n\n“Who do you think you are?” she hissed. Tears brushed across my cut and added to the pain. I was retracing every bit of the day I could remember to figure out what I could have possibly done wrong. Her grip tightened and I could feel each strand of hair in her hand being pulled. “I DON’T KNOW! I DON’T KNOW! I’M SORRY!” I shrieked. My cries must’ve echoed throughout the whole school, but I knew that no one was going to save me. \n\nAfter she released my hair, Paige signaled for the others to let me go. I fell to the floor with a loud thud and I just laid there. She knelt down and whispered into my ear, “Aaron is mine. Don’t you dare speak to him again.” I saw my cell phone clatter onto the floor in front of my face and one of the girls stomped on it a few times. They left me there and I waited until I couldn’t hear their laughter anymore to lift myself up.\n\nAaron is just a boy in one of my classes, and we were paired up for a small project. We simply exchanged numbers to do the assignment with no other intentions. But things like that always happen to me. I had recently transferred to this school, and being a new student is never easy, especially in the middle of the year. My mother and I were forced to relocate due to an incident at my previous school. There's just something about me that attracts misfortune.\n\nI wiped my face, which was tender to the touch, and looked down to see crimson streaks on my hand. I picked up my phone which had become a lump of shattered glass and plastic. The pain that was building inside my chest was far worse than the pain on my body. My mother had recently bought that phone for me in an attempt to make me feel better about the move. While walking through the familiar lonely halls, I squeezed the remnants of my phone.\n\nAs I stepped past the front gate of the school I heard the low rumble of thunder followed by light water droplets. When it rains it pours. Thankfully I only lived a few blocks away so I lifted my backpack over my head and jogged home. When I got to the front door of my apartment unit I slid my key inside and opened the door. Everything was pitch black and I called out, “Mom, you home?” There was no answer.\n\nI flipped the light switch, the bulb above me flickered a bit before finally staying on and I saw a piece of white paper waiting for me at the dining table. “Hey, Becky Boo, hope you had a good day at school. Call me if you need anything!” I looked back at my phone, there was no way I was going to do anything with that thing. Guilt began to wash over me. If I wasn’t so afraid of them, if I could stand up for myself then maybe I wouldn’t be put in those shitty situations. \n\nAs I stood there in wet clothes, the AC kicked on and the cold air chilled me. I went towards my room to change my clothes, but as I passed by the bathroom, I caught sight of myself in the mirror above the sink. I took a pause and looked at my reflection. I had long, wet black hair that made me look like the girl from the Ring movie, skinny and pale. I followed the thin red line on my cheek to the cut Paige had given me and I looked into my eyes. They were sunken and bloodshot, my eyes showed nothing but contempt for myself. \n\nAfter I changed I curled into a ball on top of my bed, hoping the sheets would consume me somehow. I wanted to sleep all the pain I had away, but whenever I closed my eyes I could feel her…slender fingers like spider legs lightly tracing the back of my neck. I began to feel nauseous and quickly sat myself upright. I tried my best to shake off the bad feelings, but the pit in my gut remained. I decided to preoccupy my mind by grabbing my laptop off of my desk. Instead of wallowing, it’d be more productive to look for a new phone.\n\nI was able to shift my full attention to the different tabs on my laptop. I’ve had some money saved up, but frustration began to set in when I couldn’t find anything affordable. That’s when I thought of trying to look through a local marketplace. After a few more minutes of scrolling I found someone selling a phone exactly like mine, not only in perfect condition, but vastly cheaper. I messaged the seller and they quickly replied to meet in the morning. \n\nI was happy to have ended the day on a positive note. I got ready for school as usual the next morning and made sure my cut was properly bandaged. I peeked into my Mom’s bedroom and found her sound asleep. I carefully closed her door and exited the apartment towards the meeting place. I know what you're thinking: a young girl meeting a stranger online is a major red flag, but I chose a small convenience store with a large crowd.\n\nWhen I got to the store I waited at the front entrance in clear view of the security camera. I stood there for a few minutes until I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see a woman wearing a heavy brown coat with a dark red head wrap. Her face was gaunt and her eyes were like pink disks as she stared at me with wide eyes. “Are you, B-Becky?” she spoke as if trying to fight back tears. “You’re the one I talked to online about the phone, right?” I asked nervously. \n\nThe woman wiped her eyes and placed her hand on my cheek. “Oh goodness, you poor thing…what happened to you?”. Her fingers on my face caused my stomach to turn and I froze there. The woman brushed her thumb across the bandage across my face and I could see tears welling up in her eyes. “You remind me of her. Every time I saw her she would become more and more broken..” She removed her hand from me and dug it into her coat pocket to present me with the phone I was buying. \n\n“Oh! Um…Perfect!” When I went to get the money from my backpack, the woman refused. \"Don't worry, Darling, you need a friend,\" she said quietly with tears streaming down her face. I was at a loss for words and stood there awkwardly watching her walk away. I couldn't believe it; the interaction was strange, but I got a free phone in the end. As soon as I arrived at school, I sat on one of the benches and inserted my SIM card into the phone before turning it on. I was worried that something would go wrong, but it turned on and everything appeared to be normal.\n\nI was happy to have a cellphone, but the memory of what happened the day prior reminded me to be ever so cautious. I went through the day trying to make myself as small as possible. I made sure to not make any ripples or bring any attention, that was until I reached the class with Aaron. He approached me after class and asked if I was okay, his concern was directed at the bandage on my cheek. I told him that everything was fine, but it wasn't. I could see the group of girls from yesterday down the hall and they were glaring at me.\n\nBefore I knew it the day had ended and I was being dragged outside to the back of the school. Paige pushed me and my back slammed onto the brick. Three other girls surrounded us to prevent me from escaping. “You little slut. You just don’t learn, do you?” Paige’s words were like venom. “We’ve all heard about your little fling with a teacher at your last school.” I began to feel dizzy as painful memories began to resurface. \n\nI flinched as she brought her hand up to place it on the wall. “It wasn’t enough to fuck everyone at your last school?” Paige said with a sneer. Suddenly her fist found its way to my stomach and I bent over in agony. She proceeded to grab me by my throat and brought me back to the wall. “P-please..stop..” I managed to croak despite her tight grip on my neck. Her angry expression reminded me of her…that woman…the one I placed my trust in from my last school. \n\nThe other girls around us began to shout out things like, “Teach her a lesson!” and “Get that whore!” I just wanted all of this to be over with. If bad things kept happening to me then I would be better off… Before I could finish that thought a loud buzz made everything go silent. We all stood motionless as the buzzing sound seemed to grow louder and louder. “What the hell is that?” one girl asked. Their eyes all shifted to my backpack that was at my feet. \n\n“Didn’t we break her phone?” one girl asked. “Ignore it!” Paige insisted. She brought her left hand up to slap my face, but the buzzing…that buzzing was relentless. “Christ! Who the hell is calling?” she shouted, then she removed her hand from my neck and placed it back on the wall. “Shut it up!” she ordered. I complied fearfully and crouched down to take the phone from my bag. I looked at the screen, and even though it was buzzing, there was no contact information displayed.\n\nI swiped the screen to reject the incoming call but as soon as I did the phone started to buzz again. I did it again and again and again, but the phone wouldn’t stop buzzing. Paige glared at me and whispered under her breath, “Answer it…but you better watch what you say..” I nodded yes and my shaky hand swiped across the screen to accept the call. I placed the phone up to my ear and tried to sound as composed as I possibly could in this situation.\n\n“Hello?” I managed to squeak and for an excruciating few seconds there was silence on the other end. “Well? Who the Hell is it?” Paige muttered. The other girls took a step closer and I called out, “Hello? Who is it?” My ears were filled with the sound of my racing heart. Each thump rocked my ribs and I was so afraid of what they were going to do to me. Then a voice emerged from the phone, a girl’s voice that asked in a sweet tone, “Do you need help?”\n\nI didn’t recognize the voice, but whoever it was asked again, “Do you need help?” My answer got caught in my throat as the girl’s voice seemed to echo in my skull, “Doyouneedhelpdoyouneedhelpdoyouneedhelp.” I was so focused on the voice in my phone that I didn’t realize Paige was screaming at me. “Who the Hell is it?” Paige’s voice broke me out of my stupor. She raised her hand above her head and I screamed, “YES!” She snatched the phone out of my hand and ended the call. \n\nAs soon as Paige ended the call the phone began to buzz in her hand. Frustrated, she swiped the phone and put it against her ear. “Hello? She’s busy!” she said and after a couple of seconds her angry face twisted into confusion and then…to fear. “Hello? Hey…who is this? Who are you?!” Paige looked at me and I looked right into her eyes to see something familiar, the same eyes I saw in my reflection last night.\n\nThe girls around us began to ask Paige if she was okay but her full attention was on the phone call. I realized her eyes were no longer set on me, but behind me. For a moment I thought I saw her eyes go completely white then a noise exploded next to my ear…CRACK. That sickening sound made us all go silent. Then again…a loud CRACK. I turned my head to see Paige banging her head against the brick wall. She kept on slamming her face on the wall and each time she did I felt a splash of warm blood hit my face. \n\nEventually the other girls raced over trying to stop Paige from hurting herself any more. When they were finally able to pull her away her face…her face was just a sunken bloody mess. My phone clattered onto the cement at her feet and I saw that the call had ended. The girls were all crying and one of them called 911, but we all knew that it was too late. Paige was dead and I stood there, stunned as I stared at her corpse with blood splattered all over me.",

        "text": " \n\nMy cousin and I booked a 5 day trip to our grandparents old house when it listed on air bnb, and for some reason I just couldn’t shake this restlessness ever since I saw the confirmation email. \n\nWe packed up the car and my husband asked if I wanted him to come up with us. I said no it was something me cousin wanted us to do together, I knew he hadn’t taken the time off and with work deadlines he’d be doing himself a disservice to go hangout in not even a cool place for the week. I told him traveling made me nervous and it was true. It did, being away from home, away from my stuff made the distance feel even farther.\n\nThe trip was long but pretty uneventful. We left really early in the morning about 5:30am and got there around 4:30pm. Everything from the highway onwards was almost the same. The last 20 years hadn’t really changed anything in this old town. The long road that led to the property was miles and miles long with small homes nestled deep in off the main road. The area was still predominantly very wild. We didn’t see a single person out beside 2 trucks when we first turned on leaving the shadowy area behind. \n\nAs we pulled into the driveway. All the memories I had created there with my family came flooding back, the ugly speckled hallway I ran down as a child, knocking on every door, waking everyone up on the weekends, the stone fireplace in the back living room where my grandmother laid plastic so the couches were never really set on, the small pantry area where the washer and dryer barely fit and when it got too hot would melt any chocolate in the room. We spent the next 30/40 mins just wandering around reminiscing.\n\nI walked into my great grandmother's old room I remember watching law and order svu all night in here, the dramatic bedroom furniture African themed was gone and replaced by a dresser, a queen-sized bed. It was a different room meant for a different life. \n\nHe sat in his old bedroom alone for a bit, the same room that my grandfather died in years later was the room he grew up in. \n\nGuess it was that type of trip for him. \n\nI could hear him crying quietly in his room, and I knew I wouldn’t be seeing much of him for the rest of the night. After a while I heard his light snores and as the rain came of course….. He snored louder. \n\nI could hear him snoring across the hall and knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep with the noises \n\nI left my sleeping pills at home, figuring I’d be passed out from all the driving and bonding. Work stress was the reason I didn’t sleep well to begin with and for the next week I wasn’t going to be doing any work. \n\nIt was cold for October and the rain made it even colder. The house grew icy as it got later and later i thought it would be fun to light the fireplace. I had only lit it a few times as a kid and I remembered how cool it was. I sat in the back living room reading a book on my phone. My back to the wrap-around porch, the fire burning small on the few logs I added. \n\nThe fire burned and it started to get smoky pretty quickly in the living room. I put the fire out but was still stuck in this smoky ass room. I reached over to open a window behind me, and stopped before I pulled the shade up. There was a shadow on the outside of the window, just a small sliver of something. I slid down the couch slowly onto the floor. Kicking myself. I’m an adult why be afraid of a small shadow? But still, I didn’t move or breathe. I stood up quickly realizing I wasn’t 10 anymore and the shadow on the bottom of the window was gone. \n\nI looked around the room not wanting to turn on a light and saw the crank for the outside vent I turned it open and let the smoke out. I was thankful I didn’t have to open a window. \n\nWhat was outside of the window, what was leaning against it? Why was it there? Why was I here again? \n\nMy cousin's snores reminded me. Oh yeah him. Our grandfather died when I was a kid and he was a teenager. My cousin was obsessed with my grandfather and took it the hardest when he found out he was sick. The day he died the only day my cousin had taken for himself in months was the day my grandfather passed. In the few moments he was alone, he was gone. \n\nMy cousin had been plagued by guilt, and no matter how many times we told him cancer killed our grandfather he blamed himself. \n\nI eventually went to sleep across the hall from him. I preferred the proximity to the annoying snores.\n\nI watched the window until I couldn’t keep my eyes up existing to see a shadow moving against the outside window. \n\nIn the morning we went to the small kitchen for breakfast realizing that the window treatments our grandmother had installed were removed for a more modern look. It removed privacy as well. We saw a hundred thick old trees, decades and decades old. I thought about how much they had seen, wishing they could talk to us. while we sat and ate. I didn’t want to tell him about the shadow. It sounded stupid saying it now. There are animals outside, he’d agree. So I let it go and we focused on catching up and looking around. \n\nWe walked around the property, talking about our family and all the fun we had as kids. my idea of course to see if I could see anything that could have been explained the night before. There wasn’t much, but right under the porch awning but still, in the dirt, I saw an impression of a large paw print. \n\nMy cousin saw it and said it looked like a bear print but I didn’t see anything like that. Bears prints don’t look like huge dog prints. \n\nWe shrugged it off and drove to the grocery store a few miles away. \n\nThe small store was pretty empty, we recognized the butcher, and our cashier was my grandparents old neighbor growing up. The woman was older than dirt when I was a child and still looked as ancient as she had ever had. \n\nShe recognized my cousin and knew me by name. She asked what we were doing out here and how had we been when we told her we were renting our grandparent's house for the week she looked really surprised. \n\nThe old Hawkins house she said again. \n\nWe nodded there was no other house. \n\nShe said there had been a lot of issues in the woods around that area for years. My grandparent's property has been sold and purchased and sold and purchased over and over again. Already 5 different people she’s introduced herself to. One day some contractors came in did some work and the house sat for 5 years. She moved shortly after that. when her goats were ripped apart in her backyard pen and her chickens killed for the 3rd time that year she was done. She was old, she raised a few small goats for the company and it was awful to have to clean up their dead mangled bodies. \n\nShe said an old man had hit something coming down the road a few years back really really late one of those days when the trees and the clouds eat up the moon. What he hit looked like a tall muscular bear but furrier. It limped off into the woods and was gone before he could get out of the drive. The car was totaled hair and blood covered the hood. He was talking in circles when the police came. The next few years had been rough for everyone on the road.\n\nApparently, the town was dying, poverty, drugs and animals being killed on this road had sadly become normal. \n\nWe were shaken when we left the store and I thought about my own encounter in the woods behind their house when I was a kid. When I was going to mention it to my cousin he started to tell me about his own encounter. \n\nHe said his friends had been drinking and smoking at my grandparent's house one weekend they were away. My aunt and uncle were pretty strict so watch the house meant get high and a little buzzed with friends. \n\nThey had dragged a picnic table a few hundred yards back into the woods, so they wouldn’t be visible or able to be smelled from the road in case anyone stopped by. They set it up with a few camping lanterns and relaxed It was barely 5:30 but with the thick trees it was as dark as the night. \n\nThey had been out there for a few hours and were having fun and laughing making fun of their friend Mark for not losing his virginity to his girlfriend after almost 2 years.\n\nThe forest went quiet like she was waiting for someone else to speak and they all felt like they were being watched all of a sudden. \n\nThe guys who had been laying on the ground, and leaning against the trees moved closer to the lanterns and all sat huddled together on the same side of the table. \n\nThey listened but heard nothing but their heartbeats screaming in their ears. They were all afraid. \n\nMy cousin told them they should go inside but none of them wanted to get away from the table. They sat there in silence and eventually the noise came back to the forest. They finished their beers and ran towards the house as fast as they could suddenly. \n\nMy cousin said he stayed behind and cleaned up some, it was only a few hundred yards from the house. If he moved his head back and forth he could kind of make out where the house should have been. \n\nHe cleaned up bottles and collected the lanterns the idiots ran through the forest without them. \n\nHe heard crunching sounds in the distance, a birds wings slapping the air, and looked around, nothing was there that he saw but the lights only illuminated about 10 feet around him. He was annoyed his friends left him. But he was 17 and the riffle he always took into the woods was at his side. \n\nHe started to turn back and head towards the house when he saw something run behind him near the cave. He thought it was some of his friends and called for them to stop. The crunching kept on but it sounded fuller and louder. He grabbed the gun dropped the bag of bottles and bolted for the house. As he turned back he towards the cave to see if he was being followed something stood up a bit still hunched over beside the cave entrance 30 or 40 feet from where they were sitting. \n\nHe ran quickly and ran face-first into one of his friends. After he hadn’t been back after a few mins they felt bad and came back. \n\nMy cousin said he couldn’t explain he just got up and ran home past them. They all hit the back door panting. Looking scared but not really sure of what. \n\nMy cousin finally calmed down after his friends gave him a beer and he sat there still holding his gun shaking talking about a huge dog like creature he saw out there. \n\nHe rubbed his palms hard on his jeans as we sat in the parking lot. \n\nOnce we got back to the house the color in his face came back and he wondered if the table and weed and bags were still back there. It was bright and sunny, the trees had thinned some for the upcoming winter so, we could see pretty deep into the forest. \n\nOnce he mentioned an old pocket knife he thought he may have dropped that my grandfather gave him. I finally gave in and we trekked back there. \n\nThe table was there and fragments of broken bottles were there. The weed was hard as a rock in a little baggie and the remaining stained lantern was donzo. \n\nWe stood out there staring at his teenage mess we saw the cave and he motioned for me to come over. \n\nIt was right there, he pointed. \n\nSort of crouched down. He stood beside the cave and the side of the entrance came up to almost his shoulder. \n\nIt was crouched and almost bigger than this. \n\nThat’s huge I thought. \n\nHe moved away frowning, the smile he had, had faded. \n\nWe started to walk back home and we heard crunching and breaking branches in the background. We turned but saw nothing. \n\nI had a ball in the pit of my stomach and I walked quickly back over the white fence and we got inside. \n\nI was kind of angry at him. He wanted us to go into the woods to go back into that nightmare with fresh eyes. \n\nI can’t help but think of whatever was out there on the porch just the night before. \n\nWas it what he saw, what that man hit? \n\nWe ordered dinner from a Thai restaurant a town over and ate it in the kitchen as the sun went down. The rain started up again and the house grew colder by the minute. The insulation was something that hadn’t been messed with. A wind sound and breeze in the kitchen cooled our coffee and my cousin went looking for the draft. \n\nHe pulled the cord for the ladder that led to the attic, and saw there was a hole behind where the fireplace was, and it was covered by a black sheet, He knocked on the ceiling right near where the wood had been broken and moved carefully on the plants in the middle of the floor, he saw the outside of the forest, there had been pieces of boards torn off, and scratches on the inside of the wall, it looked like dried dark blood or ink maybe and shells littered the floor, dust piled over them, and sleeping bag looking cloths sacks were in the far corner hidden, books candles jugs of water were up there. He got down quickly and brought back a casing. \n\nHe told me what he saw, and I didn’t know what to say. I told him about what Miranda and I saw when we were kids what was outside of the window and what ran past me outside. For a second I thought it was a dog, but it was so dark that night. I only looked for a second. I was on the ground hiding in the bushes. \n\nWe finished eating and grabbed a few beers we sat in the living room saying nothing the storm beat on and we started to hear a whimpering outside. \n\nIn between the rain pounding and the wind howling, we heard a small whimpering outside. Little yelps and barks told us it was a dog or a puppy trapped out in the rain. People often dump their pets along this road. \n\nWe both grabbed our raincoats and ran outside. \n\nIt was hard to see much, it was rainy and stormy. The barking was high pitched and demanding. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. We ran past the benches and the caves. We watched them as fade as we listened for the puppies' cries. It had to be a puppy. \n\nThe sound was so loud and then suddenly we found what was making it, as the sounds changed to a higher pitch whine. It turned around the dog creature looked like a creepy old dog but upright. It’s dark hair was plastered to its dog head, it looked a Doberman and a cross between the werewolves from underworld. \n\nThe creature stopped making the sound, it got what it wanted. We were out there. Most of it was concealed by the trees and the darkness. My cousin pulled out a gun from his jacket and fired at it. It screamed a guttural noise and ran, we ran towards the house. We were back inside in just a few mins we ran faster than we ever had. \n\nI cried once we were safe and he handed me the gun and grabbed another from his lockbox. He had come with a lot of ammo, and another gun. I sat the gun beside me and it fell heavy on the ground. \n\nWhat the fuck. I asked him. Did you come here to kill it. \n\nWhy bring me along. \n\nMiranda’s sister told me, what happened to you guys. \n\nIt let you go, it let me go too. When it came around all the bad thing started. We have to kill it. \n\nHe ran out into the night again, leaving the porch door wide open. I closed it and started to pack. I was annoyed that we had made ourselves at home everywhere. Because there were clothes, snacks, and shoes everywhere. I packed us all up and held the gun at my side and looked around the side of the door. I could see the car, but the whole side of the house I couldn’t see. \n\nI sat in the car, in the reverse position ready for anything. \n\nI heard something after a few mins the rain was starting to slow down, and I heard my cousin calling my name. \n\nI debated what I should do, and put my head out the window and screamed car over and over. I saw him coming from around the house, his head bleeding. He was shooting his gun that had run out of bullets and I took it away from him as he got inside the car. \n\nHe reversed the car hard and ran through the wet grass leaving an angry muddy tire print all the way to the road. I headed for the highway as he cried beside me. I see something moving in the woods and went from 45 to 70 quickly. We drive for hours and didn’t stop until Georgia. We grabbed breakfast st McDonald’s and sat in their dark parking lot. As soon as we parked he asked if we could get back on the road. \n\nHe asked to drive but his hands stopped shaking and I didn’t want him driving in his condition. \n\nHe said when he left the house he knew it would be at the cave so we went inside but it wasn’t there. He sat at the dark back of the cave to get out of the rain when he saw a small creature run past the entrance. It looked like a puppy but the proportions were all wrong it’s legs were too long and it kind of looked like a child wrapped in fur the small, the odd canine face made it clear it wasn’t a person. He said he ran out of the cave and saw the large wolf creature in the woods the small one peering out from behind its leg. It screamed go and threw a rock at my cousin that hit him in the head. He said he dropped the other gun and ran. \n\nWhen we got back home. I told my husband that the neighborhood was dangerous and the house was in a bad condition so we didn’t want to stay. \n\nHe didn’t ask too much about it, I was thankful and my cousin has avoided me like the plague for the last few months. My mom told me he’s thinking of moving back to NC this year, and he mentioned to his mom that my grandparent's house was for sale.",

        "text": "Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ev99d/does\\_anyone\\_remember\\_a\\_kids\\_show\\_titled\\_laughing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ev99d/does_anyone_remember_a_kids_show_titled_laughing/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Grinning Man sat on the black sandy beaches of Laughing Island, holding my son up in the air like a prized trophy. My son, David, stood smiling at me, his eyes blank, his body as limp as a ragdoll’s. Behind him, the Grinning Man opened his massive mouth, disengaging his jaw like a snake before sticking my son’s head inside his mouth. As the Grinning Man’s countless shark teeth closed down around his neck, sending out spurts of blood and filling the air with the smell of copper and iron, I woke up screaming.\n\nI was still in the hospital, recovering from an emergency surgery that saved my life after my son had shot me in the leg with my own .45 revolver from my bedroom. The dream lingered in my mind, and I expected to see the characters of the show creep out from underneath the bed at any moment, or jump out of the linen closet. Turning to look around the room, however, I only saw my father, sitting there with a cane by the side of his chair, a slight frown creasing his lips.\n\n“We need to talk,” he said in his gruff voice, his eyes watery and unfocused. “David still isn’t responding. Totally catatonic. He is under psychiatric observation for 72 hours right now.”\n\n“He… shot me…” I said weakly. My father shook his head.\n\n“Whatever took control of him, that wasn’t David. That show, it somehow possesses the kids who watch it, puts something else in control of their minds. And once it is done with them, it often leaves them as hollow shells of people, sometimes in a coma, sometimes catatonic, other times just dead.” He pointed at me. “Except for you.”\n\n“Me?” I asked, confused. He nodded.\n\n“I never told you, but as a child, you too watched that show, talked about the Grinning Man. This was at the beginning of all the deaths, before I really knew the pattern, and at first I dismissed it as just your imaginary friend. You always were a creative child. I thought you just made an entire TV show in your head, and used the black screen of the TV like a sounding board to imagine all the characters. You talked about the Grinning Man puppet, which always creeped me out the most, and Sheriff Hogan, the huge puppet dressed in black military uniform with polished leather boots and a Death Head visor cap. You talked about the Teardrop Lady, a woman in ripped-up clothing who walked around the island, constantly crying blood and asking where her daughter went. I figured you got the Sheriff Hogan stuff from some World War 2 documentary you might’ve seen, even though I never let you watch any of that crap when you were seven years-old. \n\n“But then things started to get really weird. I had heard another child was in custody for killing his parents with a hammer while they slept. Apparently he said the Grinning Man had told him to crush his mother’s Valium and bring it to his parents mixed with hot cocoa, which they both drank before going to bed. They were so zoned out that they probably didn’t even feel the hammer when it crashed into their skulls. At least, I like to think so. But who knows? Maybe they felt everything. Once they were immobilized by strikes to the skull, he started working on their feets, their legs, their hands and arms, bashing away until they had hundreds of fractures throughout their bodies.\n\n“After talking about the Grinning Man, Laughing Island, Sheriff Hogan and the Teardrop Lady for hours, he was involuntarily committed to a juvenile psychiatric unit, where he ended up hanging himself with his bedsheets, a grin still plastered across his face when they found him. He had bitten at his wrists, opening up the wrists, and written in his own blood on the walls of the bathroom. His last words, finger-painted on the white tiles, were, ‘No angry kiddies, no sad kiddies, no evil kiddies and no bad kiddies’. Just like that weird Sheriff Hogan puppet used to sing when he buried real kids alive on the show- at least according to those kids who had seen it. \n\n“The descriptions of the kids on the show ended up matching real missing persons, children who had mysteriously disappeared across the country, children whose bodies we never found. Maybe those bodies were never found because they truly were taken to Laughing Island, buried alive or stabbed or burned alive, or any one of another hundred fates that witnesses stated happened to kids on the show. But at the time, the entire idea seemed absurd. I thought there was no such thing as supernatural phenomena, no such thing as demonic possession or magic shows that made innocent kids into killers.\n\n“But despite not really believing any of it. I left work early that day to check on you. Your mother was visiting your dying grandmother in the hospital down in Florida, and thank God for that. She was thousands of miles away from us when it happened, and that may have saved her life.\n\n“When I came home, you were inches away from the TV, watching a pure black screen. Hell, the damned thing wasn’t even plugged in, but you acted like you saw your favorite show on the screen anyway. Your eyes were totally blank but you had an ear-to-ear grin, like you had just gotten to Disneyworld or received the best present of your life. I called your name softly. ‘Jonny,’ I said, and you turned and looked at me, still smiling. You pointed to the TV and said, ‘The Grinning Man- he’s here. And he loves you daddy. He wants us to come with him to Laughing Island, where everyday feels like Christmas and everyone is always happy, and being sad or angry is *illegal.*’ Then I saw you holding my personal handgun in your little hands. That gun looked far too big for such tiny hands to handle. I’m not even sure how you got in the gun safe, for as far as I knew you had no idea what the combination was.\n\n“As you aimed it at me, something started coming out of the black TV screen. It was sickly white, like some worm in a cave that hasn’t seen sunlight in millions of years. The arms were thin and far longer than any human’s arms could ever be. Slender fingers with too many joints on them began gripping at the border of the TV, pulling itself out with immense speed, as if I were watching a video that had been fast-forwarded. The blackness of the TV rippled like a pond of black ink as its head came out, showing the Grinning Man with his hundreds of vicious teeth across his smile and his protuberant black eyes. He grabbed your shoulders like he was massaging you, and whispered something in your ear. You started laughing and pulled the trigger.\n\n“Luckily, you were just a little kid and didn’t know much about aiming or focusing on center mass, so you hit me in the leg instead. I fell instantly, feeling sick waves of pain rush over my body, the sticky blood soaking through my pant leg in a matter of seconds. I knew I had almost no time to react if I wanted to survive this, so I did the only thing I could think to do. I was, at the time, still in my cop uniform, so I had my service pistol on me. I took it out and began shooting at the TV and the Grinning Man. As soon as the TV blew apart in a shower of sparks, you seemed to come back, dropping the gun instantly and running over to me, sobbing and screaming as you saw all the blood. The Grinning Man had crawled back into the TV and it was just you and me again. I told you to call 911, and you did, and I was saved. Just like you with your son. It is almost like the story repeats itself throughout the generations, as if we’re being targeted by the Grinning Man and all his friends.” My father heaved a deep sigh.\n\n“So you were never actually shot in the leg by a drug dealer?” I asked, stunned by all the revelations he had shared. I didn’t remember a single second of that horrible day. Maybe I had blocked it all out to maintain my sanity, or maybe the Grinning Man had somehow wiped my memory around the events. Either way, it made me sick to my stomach to realize I had tried to kill my own loving father.\n\n“No, that injury was from you, though you know it wasn’t your fault. Not at all. None of those children were responsible for what they did to their parents. You need to always remember that. David is not responsible for shooting you, either.”\n\n“So what happened after all that?” I asked, not really wanting to know, but still needing to know regardless. \n\n“You were totally catatonic by the time I woke up from emergency surgery on my leg. It was like you slipped into a coma, but your eyes were still open, still blankly staring at the ceiling and moving around, as if you saw something there. Nothing helped at first. All the medications they tried to give you, the therapy, even the electroshock, all had zero effect. I eventually got you discharged from the hospital and started homecare on you, with your mother’s help. We looked for help, and your mother heard stories about a Buddhist monk who had dealt with similar possessions and spirit infestations in his home country. We were able to pay for his airfare and brought him to see you.\n\n“We weren’t allowed to see what he did, but he locked himself in your room with you for three days and nights, chanting. He had an ancient leather tome, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, written in the original language by some Tibetan saint centuries ago. He talked to you in English sometimes- we could hear him outside the door, trying to guide your mind back to your body. He would say something like ‘Your mind is in a luminous state between worlds now. Do not follow the smoky red light to rebirth in the animal world. Do not follow the black lights to the Hell world. Follow the white light, and follow the sound of my voice. Come back to the human world. Come back to your family and those who love you.’\n\n“After three days and nights, he opened the door, and you were just sitting up in bed, as if you had woken from a fever dream. You were rubbing your eyes, confused, and didn't remember anything that had happened. That’s when I made up the lie about getting shot in the leg by a drug dealer and forced to retire, to make you feel better. I didn’t want you blaming yourself.” My father heaved a deep sigh.\n\n“So you’re saying there are people that can bring back David?” I asked, the first rays of hope shining through the suffocating despair.\n\n“I’ll make some calls,” he said. After that, I received another dose of morphine for my leg from the nurse and fell back asleep, dreaming of the Grinning Man and children being buried alive in the white sands of a far-away island.\n\nSadly, it turned out the Buddhist monk who had rescued me had long ago died of old age. My father still had connections, though, and while we couldn’t find anyone with the power of the old Tibetan monk, one of his friends recommended an old Siberian shaman who had dealt with similar cases of demonic possession and catatonia. Within a few days, we had David discharged from the hospital, back in his own room, and the ancient shaman standing in the kitchen with us. He introduced himself as Ayangat. He had bronze skin, huge eyes and a shaved head. For a man in his seventies, he had almost no wrinkles and looked and acted much younger. His body language radiated peace and calmness, and when he shook my hand, I felt a tremendous heat radiating from his flesh.\n\n“We have little time to waste,” Ayangat said, frowning slightly. “Your son has been gone, lost in the place between worlds for too long. Every minute we delay, he gets farther away from us. We must begin immediately.” Ayangat pulled out a clear glass bottle, filled with some brown liquid. I saw glittery particulate matter floating throughout the deepness of the elixir.\n\n“This is a concoction of my own making I refer to as the ‘Holy Trinity’. Three sacred mushrooms from around the world, extracted and brewed to a very high concentration. Namely, I use psilocybin mushrooms from the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, Amanita muscaria from Siberia and reishi mushrooms from the highlands of China. The reishi will have a calming effect and strengthen your heart and aura for the ceremony. The psilocybin will open your third eye and allow you to see the unseen, and the Amanita muscaria will allow you to go out of your body and enter another part of spacetime, the part inhabited by your boy currently. By focusing, we can push your consciousness to the dimension where your son is trapped, and you may be able to bring him back. I say ‘may’ because there is a very real chance this will not work. You must be prepared for the possibility that not only will you not retrieve your son, but that in the process of rescuing him, you may become trapped yourself.” I shook my head, barely believing I was about to go through with this, but remembering my son’s blanken, waxy face, I strengthened my resolve.\n\nWe entered David’s room. Drool puddled on his pillow from his gaping mouth, his eyes unblinking and unseeing as we passed in front of him. The shaman poured some of the mushroom concoction into the skull of a deer he had fashioned into a cup, and handed it over to me.\n\n“Say a prayer to whatever God or gods you believe in,” the shaman said, “and drink deeply.” Looking down, I asked God for help, then drank the dark elixir in one huge gulp. It tasted absolutely disgusting, like old gym socks and mushrooms left outside to ferment, with undertones of pure bitterness. I made a face, revolted, but managed to keep it down. The shaman nodded at me, smiling for the first time. He sat me down in a chair next to my son’s bed, then pulled what looked like a hand-mirror from his bag, except instead of a reflective mirror, it had polished obsidian stone. It was so smooth and glossy I could almost see my own reflection in the blackness of it.\n\n“Now stare into the sacred mirror,” he said, “and listen to my voice.” I stared into the mirror, at first not feeling anything. Suddenly a wave overtook my body, and the mirror started to expand and pulse with its own heartbeat. Within seconds, all I could see was the black stone covering my entire vision, sending out rainbows of light and iridescent sparks from every corner. As I stared deeper into it, the blackness became a tunnel, and I felt myself being sucked into it.\n\nAs I neared the end of the tunnel, I could hear maniacal laughing and see the white sands of a beach approaching. The shaman’s voice came through, muted and sounding far-away.\n\n“Follow the tunnel to the place where your son lies,” he said, “and strengthen your heart for the battle to come.” Then his voice disappeared entirely and I felt myself falling. I landed hard on a sandy beach, looking up into the bright summer sun. I tried to remember where I was or what I was doing, but my mind felt fuzzy. I looked around and saw David, sitting at the ocean’s edge, staring off into the horizon.\n\n“David!” I yelled, and he turned towards me. Tears streamed down his face, but he said nothing. “Come to me, David. We must get out of here immediately. There are evil things on this island. Let me take you home.” I saw a flash of white out of the corner of my eye, and turning, realized the Grinning Man was running out of the palm trees of the island. His wicked smile and insane eyes were all I could see before he plowed into me, sending me sprawling. Before I could recover, he bent down, disengaging his jaw like a snake’s, and came towards me. Instinctively I reached up with my right arm to push him away, but he bit it off at the wrist, shaking it from side to side like a rabid dog. Blood spurted from the stump and I cried out in pain and shock. \n\nDavid ran at the Grinning Man from the side, pushing him off balance. It gave me a moment to try to recover. I sat up, groggy, my vision blackening from the blood loss, but the adrenaline gave me the strength to act. Pushing myself up with my good arm, I began to kick at the Grinning Man’s neck with my good leg, then stomp on it. His insane black eyes just stared up at me, blood streaming down his sickly white skin, my hand already swallowed and forever gone. David joined me, kicking at the Grinning Man’s eyes until blood ran down his face like crimson tears. I felt myself weakening, stumbling, and I grabbed David’s hand with my one remaining hand.\n\n“We need to go,” I said, dragging him towards the black tunnel I had come through. At the end, I saw a pinpoint of white light. I never loosened my grip on David, and together we followed the white light back into his room.\n\nI fell out of the tunnel, holding my spurting arm and getting blood all over the wooden floors of David’s room. For the second time in a month, the blood loss was putting me to sleep. I heard the shaman’s voice, still calm, as he called an ambulance, then I fell asleep.\n\nLike deja vu, I woke back up in the hospital. I had a feeling they must be getting sick of me. Now not only would I have a permanently damaged leg, but I was also missing my right hand. I had torn open the stitches on my leg in the process of rescuing David, requiring the surgeon to open up the bandages and fix all the new damage I had done. But none of that bothered me, because David was back.\n\nHe sat next to my bedside, holding my hand, looking so small and helpless. His large brown eyes regarded me sadly.\n\n“Do you think the Grinning Man is gone?” he asked me. I looked at him for a moment.\n\n“I think we’re safe now,” I said, not answering his question.",

        "text": "I was not born with the ability to see the memory feeders. It’s something that came to me when I was five, after a beating from my maternal grandfather left me close to death. \n\nWhen I woke up in the hospital I saw one of the creatures for the first time. At first I thought it was a bird, looking out at me through the air vent. It made jerky movements and twisted its head at impossible angles.\n\nThen, it flattened itself as thin as a stingray and seeped out the vent, entering my hospital room, where it flew down and landed on my grandfather’s shoulder as he slept. Then it opened its mouth, and stuck its long tongue into his ear.\n\nWhen the police visited my room and asked my grandfather what had happened to me, he told them, “I don’t remember.” And he was telling the truth.\n\nI work in hospice care now, in a large city. We specialize in family work, and many of our clients are in their 40s and 50s. The creatures love to feed here, because the memories are fresh and whole. \n\nOver time, I’ve learned their habits. They prefer the taste of happy memories: weddings, births, birthdays, graduations. There are some clients they just won’t touch. The dying men with no families, with hollow eyes might as well be rotten meat to the memory eaters.\n\nI generally don’t interfere with the creatures' feeding. My clients are generally so close to death, that I figure they have a few memories to spare. What’s the harm if a Christmas morning gets forgotten? \n\nAnd if I’m being honest, maybe I’ve been jealous. Because I’m rotten meat. I search and search, and all I find are bad memories. My mom’s OD. My grandparents’ resentment. My dad visiting dead drunk, shouting into the night. The feeders avoid me like I’m radioactive.\n\nI do try to keep the feeders away from visitors. The creatures can hardly contain themselves when children’s footsteps come thumping down the hall, eager to see mom or grandma. If I’m not careful, the creatures will descend from the vents and feed on *The First Time Emma Saw Snow* or *That Friday Samuel Skipped School and Cuddled with Mom on the Couch All Day.*\n\nIn general, a vacuum is enough to scare them off. So if I see them eying a child’s ear, I’ll head into the room and get busy, even if it interrupts a tender conversation between mother and son.\n\nSometimes, though, the creatures cling to their victims like addicts, and I have to take more drastic action. I’ve found that I can grab them by the wings and fling them out the window. Once or twice, I’ve killed them, snapping their necks, but afterward, the stench smell of sulfur was overpowering, and it took weeks of scrubbing my hands before they felt clean.\n\nOverall, I would say we’d had an uneasy truce. \n\nUntil last week.\n\nLast week, a teenage girl snuck in after hours. She was basically an angel in human form. Star student, constantly volunteering at the local humane society. Her dad had been a beloved high school teacher until he drew the wrong card and ended up with stage-4 liver cancer. And he didn’t even drink. \n\nThe girl was convinced that it was dad’s last night on earth and couldn’t bear the thought of him dying without her there. So she snuck into the facility. I’m still not sure how. \n\nWhen I found her, she was sleeping in a chair in her dad’s room. And perched on her shoulder was the biggest memory eater I’d ever seen. It was big as a condor, wings stretching maybe four feet wide. It knelt over the girl with its worm-like tongue pulsing in her ear as memories flowed down its throat.\n\nIt met my eyes as it drank, and for the first time in my life, I was afraid of one. This was no little bird I could fling out the window. This one would fight. This one could kill me. I stood there shaking as the creature stared at me with its black eyes, warning me that one more step would mean death.\n\nI started to back away. If I left things as they were, no one would ever know. Even the girl might go through her whole life, never realizing what had happened. What she was missing.\n\nSomething in me couldn’t do it. No matter how much I wanted to run, I wouldn’t let myself.\n\nAnd so I charged forward, tacking the creature off the girl. It clawed at me with its talons, ripping my arms. They stung with invisible wounds, like I’d been lashed with invisible whips. It bit at me, too, trying to blind me with its beak. When that didn’t work, it unleashed its tongue, licking at my face, its saliva burning me like acid.\n\nHolding its body off with my left hand, I reached forward with my right, grabbing the creature’s tongue. Then I wrapped it around my arm over and over, gritting my teeth as the acid seeped through my skin.\n\nAs it did, I began to realize I was forgetting. \n\nMy mother was the first to go. I still had the awareness of her overdose, but the details began to grow fuzzy. Once, I’d remembered the exact angle of her body. Some kind of smell that surrounded her. Some kind of last words she’d written. \n\nNow they were all disappearing down the creature’s throat. \n\nAnd as it ate them, it gagged. Like it had eaten shit or vomit. The creature tried to pull away, but I kept holding its tongue.\n\nThe memories all began to disappear. \n\nMy grandparents were sucked out little by little until all that remained was some vague bullet points, like they were a movie I’d seen in my youth and then forgotten. Then my dad was gone too, and all the bullying through middle school. The dark things I’d thought about in high school too. The years lost and wandering before I finally got my shit together and made it into nursing school.\n\nThe creature was weak on its feet now, barely able to stand. And finally it fell to the floor, dead and bloated. Finally, as I unleashed its tongue, a wave of tiredness washed over me, and I closed my eyes.\n\nI don’t see the creatures anymore. But maybe there are things we’re not meant to see. Even now, I can feel the shape of them fading from my mind. I guess that’s part of why I’m writing this down, in case I forget them entirely.\n\nI’m ready to forget. There’s a kind of bliss in it. Ever since that night, I walk the halls of the hospice, and I don’t feel heavy anymore. I never used to hug the grieving families, but now I do. \n\nWhen that teen girl’s father died, I held her close as she wept in my arms, and she kept saying, “thank you, thank you, thank you.” Had she woken up? Has she seen the fight? Or was she thanking me for something else? And in truth, I could barely remember what I’d [done](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

        "text": "I've been packing boxes for the past few days, moving out of my parent's place, and into my own. Admittedly there wasn't a ton to do - I'm trying to furnish a whole apartment with a bedroom's worth of stuff. It's strange how it can seem like you own so many things until you move to a larger space. Suddenly, all of the things that spent years next to each other, have a whole new open area to be spread across.\n\nThere was one box that was nearly forgotten, because it wasn't a newly packed box. It was a box packed by my parents, years ago. The one almost everyone has, and has to make a decision at some point about whether to keep it. The box of your childhood things.\n\nIf my dad hadn't remembered, it would have sat up in the attic for another few years. I wonder what we would've thought as kids, peering into the future, knowing that all our favourite things end up collecting dust, and only ever thought about when you move house. It's a curious thought.\n\nI took the box to my new apartment and began sorting through it. I decided to get it out of the way first, as it was the only box where I wasn't sure of the contents. I didn't know how much I'd be keeping, throwing away, or donating. Putting everything into 3 piles was difficult, and emotional, but I was able to make a decision for most things. To say it opened a gateway back into my childhood would be wrong, as it didn't. A gateway would imply I could walk through and live it again. What it provided was a window, one which I could only look through, and never open. But what a beautiful, crystal-clear window it provided. Sorting through that box was one of the happiest moments of the past few years.\n\nUntil I got to the end. Perhaps the reason I'm focussing so much on happiness is that I'm afraid to continue this story.\n\nThe final item in the box was a diary. My diary. It was pink and shiny. Cliche, but all the TV shows had this sort of thing in, so it's what I wanted as a kid. I never stuck to many things in my childhood, and this was no different. I used it for about half a year, and even then I missed about half the days. So even after 6 months, it would've only had about 100 entries.\n\nI sat there and read every single one. Each dated about 10 years ago, and each one making me happier. But the smile dropped from my face when the dates crossed a threshold of impossibility.\n\n2 years ago.\n\n\"*Dear Diary,*\n\n*I totally forgot about this! My dad got a new job recently and had to store some of his old work stuff in the attic. I helped and found this whilst up there. Reading through the old entries was enchanting, to say the least. Maybe I'll come back sometimes and write more! :)*\n\n*Alicia*\"\n\nMy handwriting. My name. But I hadn't been up here 2 years ago. My dad didn't get a new job 2 years ago. It didn't make sense. I wasn't exactly scared at that point - I didn't know what to think. I was just confused, and so I read on.\n\n1 year ago.\n\n\"*Dear Diary,*\n\n*This again! Although I don't remember writing that last year. How strange. Was still cool to read through all of this, though. I've just moved out and found this in a box of old stuff. Good job my dad reminded me about it!*\n\n*I'm hoping that living alone isn't as scary as it seems. I suppose only time will tell.*\n\n*Future me - You got this! :)*\n\n*Alicia*\"\n\nHow could this be dated a year ago? This all happened, but it happened the same say I had read it, and I certainly never wrote it.\n\n6 months ago.\n\n\"*I'm not doing this 'diary' shit, what the fuck is this?*\n\n*I've never had a diary, in my entire life. How does this thing know everything that has happened to me as a kid?*\"\n\nAt this point, I started to freak out. This entry wasn't like the others. It wasn't just confusing for me, but clearly whoever wrote it was also confused and concerned. Except, they still seem to think they're me.\n\nThe next one changed that.\n\n4 months ago.\n\n\"*How odd. This entire journal perfectly describes my life, up until a couple of years ago (I'm moving out in a few months, I haven't already moved out!)*\n\n*But all of the entries as a child perfectly mimic my life, except for one crucial detail. My name is Rebecca. How on Earth could this be?*\"\n\nThe next one was the worst.\n\n2 months ago.\n\n\"*Dear Diary,*\n\n*Someone just broke in. I'm hiding in the attic, and I found my childhood diary. I've called the police, but I'm scared. I just need to take my mind away from this. The police wanted me to stay on the phone, but I was afraid of making noise.*\n\n*I can hear them downstairs. I hope I get to read this again soon. Writing this makes me feel like I'm going to be okay. It turns this into a memory, and not a final day.*\n\n*I wish I had time to read the past entries, but I don't. I promise I will soon.*\n\n*I just hope that I manage to*\"\n\nThe entry ended there.\n\nIt's covered in dry blood.\n\nAt this point, I was physically shaking. But, I felt like I had the duty to continue this, and so I did.\n\nI took out a pen and wrote...\n\n\"*Dear Diary,*\n\n*I don't know what this thing is.*\n\n*Will I remember writing this? What kind of power this book has is beyond me. But whatever is going on, I don't like it. I died? I moved out a year ago? My dad got a new job 2 years ago? My name is Rebecca? None of it makes any sense.*\"\n\nMy pen ran out of ink, so I went looking for another one.\n\nI intended to finish the entry. But when I returned, the journal was gone.\n\nI wonder where it went.\n\n[===](https://reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

        "text": "This happened about 2 years ago when I was house sitting for my parents. I’ve got an old beat up car in their back yard I’ve been trying to get running for a while now, so staying at their house for a weekend was a good excuse to work on it. When I got there it was about 10pm and I went out to the shed to get my tools ready for the next morning. When I opened the door to the shed I was hit with a wall of cigarette smoke. Not the actual smoke, but the distinct smell. Nobody in or around my parents house has smoked cigarettes in years so this spooked me quite a bit and I decided to just wait until morning to go out there. (For context, this shed is 2 stories and has a covered concrete patio on one side at ground level, perfect for working on a car, lawn mower, whatever.)\n\nMorning came along and I went out to my parents large 2 story shed and smelled stale cigarettes. Again, nobody smokes so it was strange. It was daylight so I wasn’t so nervous to go in there but I was still a bit spooked. I’m a 6 foot tall, strong military veteran, so it takes a lot to scare me. I was terrified when I found cigarette butts on the second floor of the shed, but there were no people so my smooth brain decided to shrug it off. \n\nI started working on the car and spent all day on it. I’ll spare you the details cause you probably don’t care, but it was a pretty major repair. It took all day and into the night before I finally could turn the key and attempt to start the car. It was about midnight by the time I was finishing up, but there was still about an hour left of putting bolts back in before I was ready to call it a night. By this point, my only flashlight that still had any battery life left was a little pen light just bright enough to see into an engine bay but not bright enough to see more than 3 feet in front of you. I was mainly relying on a plug in work light, mostly cause the heat it put off was keeping me warm. \n\nIt was about 12:30 at night when I started feeling like I was being watched. I couldn’t see into the tree line with all my lights dead, so again, smooth brain, I ignored it. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. By about 1am my phone finally died and took my music with it, so I was finishing up the last little bits in silence, still ignoring the feeling of being watched. \n\nIt was the first sound of leaves crunching in the tree line probably 20 feet away from me that really fucking scared me. However, it’s not uncommon to see deer in my parents back yard, and deer are known to watch people, so I just assumed it was a deer and kept working, confident that I could hold my own if a confrontation with a human were to occur. \n\nThe leaves crunched again a few min later, but this time it was much closer. Like just outside of the circle of light coming from my work light. When I looked up I couldn’t see anything and I’d had enough. I was tired from working on the car all day, I needed to plug my phone in, and I desperately needed to shower. So I called it a night early, grabbed my phone and my Bluetooth speaker, turned off the light, and went inside, leaving all my tools spread out across the whole area. \n\nFor some reason I never connected the cigarette butts and the creepy feeling until I got into the house. The moment I made that connection, I went around the house locking all the doors and windows and brought my pistol into the bathroom while I showered. While I was in the shower, my parents dog started to go absolutely insane. This wasn’t particularly uncommon as shes a 4 year old yellow lab with more energy than an atomic bomb. I didn’t think much of it and figured if someone was gonna try to break in, they’d be scared off by her loud barking. Eventually the barking ceased and I got out of the shower to find nothing out of place so I went to bed, bringing my pistol with me. \n\nFast forward 2 days without incident and my parents came home. I told them about the strange things that I experienced and they blew it off like it was relevant. Whatever my parents are kinda oblivious sometimes. I went home and all was well until my mom called me that night in a bit of a panic. \n\nThe same night I went home, my parents next door neighbor was coming home from the grocery store. She was alone in the house because her husband worked the Night Shift. As she was bringing her groceries into the house, leaving the door unlocked as she went back and forth, a man entered her house and tried to attack her with a knife. This badass lady managed to fight back long enough to get to her purse where she kept a little 22 pistol and she shot her attacker 3 times. He didn’t go down right away and escaped the house. She called 911 right away and the man was arrested about half a mile away. He was found in possession of a large kitchen knife, a small amount of meth, and… cigarettes. \n\nI can’t confirm if whoever was smoking in my parents shed was the same person that attacked my parents neighbor, and I can’t confirm if I was being watched by this person or if it was just a deer, but I don’t really like the idea it’s all just a coincidence.",

        "text": "When I was in the fourth grade, my friends and I had a secret clubhouse at our school. It was one of those places that only kids are stupid enough to try to get to; a small, sealed off rectangle of space between an older weathered brick building and a yellowed portable one. It was a non-place, a forgotten gap that whoever assembled the portable didn't know what to do with. To us, it was a secret realm that only we knew about. We called it the Secret Place.\n\nYou could only get to it by crawling through a narrow gap on the back side of the building, through a dark squeeze about thirty feet long and sandwiched between dirty asphalt and the underside of the portable’s floor. There were likely an uncountable amount of bugs in there, but usually a dry wind blew through it and kept the center clear of debris, which made accessing it an achievable feat for any grade schooler of sufficient bravery.\n\nIt was originally discovered by my friend Bryan, who made sure to only share it with me and our friend Jess in hushed whispers. We knew that if anyone else found out about it, it’d get shut down faster than you could say “egregious safety liability”. It would have to remain a secret if we wanted it to stay alive.\n\nThe Secret Place was only about the size of a large bathroom stall, surrounded by high walls and open to the sky above. We managed to throw a few milk crates over the wall to use as makeshift furniture, and we’d write notes and doodles to each other on the walls in black marker pen. Over the three years we’d spend there, we’d cover those walls in scribbles, always making sure not to use each other's names, to maintain deniability in case it was ever discovered. In the Secret Place, of course, you could only use your Secret Name. It was one of the many rules we agreed on that helped keep the Secret Place safe.\n\nUsually, we spent at least one lunch recess a week there, sometimes even after school. We’d make sure to only meet randomly, less frequently if anyone seemed suspicious of us. There were a few close calls. We were scolded for getting our clothes dirty on more than a few occasions. Thankfully, they didn’t ask how we managed to get cobwebs in our hair.\n\nAs three socially inept kids without many other friends to speak of, the Secret Place was our home away from home. There we could forget about our teachers and parents who didn’t understand us and be ourselves with the only other people who we could trust. And surprisingly, we managed to keep it between ourselves until we all left elementary school.\n\nI grew up and slowly forgot about the Secret Place. Bryan went to a different middle school, and the three of us all went to different high schools. Life happened. Friends came and went. I grew up and thankfully managed to develop some social skills, and by the time I graduated Bryan and Jess were distant. I still saw Jess on occasion, but we were just acquaintances now.\n\nI hadn’t thought about Bryan in years, until one morning I got an email saying he had sent me a Facebook friend request. I hadn’t used Facebook in so long I had forgotten that it even sent email notifications. After remembering my old password, I logged in and saw that he sent me a message as well. It was one line. “come to the secret place.”\n\nI sent a reply, brushing off his weird message and asking what he had been up to in the nearly a decade or so since I had last spoken to him. Looking at his profile, I saw that he hadn’t used it since he was a teenager, his last posts being back from around high school. After waiting a while for a reply, I just closed the tab and tried to move on with my day. Something about it gnawed at me though. What the hell was he thinking messaging me with some weird shit like that out of nowhere? What was he even doing these days? Was he just messing with me?\n\nI ended up messaging Jess. She replied back to me, and after catching up with each other,  I asked her if she had heard anything from Bryan. She replied that she hadn’t. I was going to mention his weird message, but I hesitated. I’m not sure why I didn’t say anything then. Either way, we chatted a bit, and I went to bed.\n\nThe next morning I still hadn’t gotten a response from Bryan. I tried to take my mind off it at work, but it nagged at the back of my mind, like an itch that I couldn’t quite scratch. I even searched his name to see if he had died and I was being haunted, but that didn’t seem to be the case. If anything, he just didn’t have an internet presence, which sounded about par for the course from what I remembered. In the end, I decided the easiest way to find out was to just go.\n\nI decided I’d swing by the school after work. It was a pretty well off public school in a suburban area near a big public park. I decided to wait until the evening, just to make sure there wouldn’t be anyone else there. An adult sneaking around a school alone isn’t a good look at the best of times, so I just wanted to get in and get out as quickly as possible.\n\nThere was a shortcut through an alleyway to get to the back side of campus, close to the buildings that hid the Secret Place. The campus looked just as I remembered it, maybe a fresh coat of paint and a new building, but nothing radical. The school was eerily silent though. I immediately regretted showing up as late as I did, as the winter sun was already entirely gone.\n\nI passed by dark classrooms cast in a blue hazy moonlight. Children’s drawings adorned the walls while the desks sat empty. I decided to pass by some of my old classrooms just for old time’s sake. The rooms, occupied by a new generation of teachers and students, were nearly unrecognizable. but the walls, the corners, the bones of the building were all the same, merely draped in a fresh skin that would be shed again in time. Only the memories remained.\n\nReaching the farthest row of buildings, I approached the gap that led to the Secret Place. There was an old board placed over it, but it was merely wedged in place – easy enough to remove. I got down on my belly and looked through the gap, the same way I’d done a hundred times before. I could see that same faraway spit of asphalt lit by the dim moon, a little dirtier, a little more overgrown with weeds. But still, it looked just as I remembered. I could even see the same old milk crate furniture. But I couldn’t see Bryan.\n\nI whispered his name into the gap, breaking the tense silence. After a few seconds, I shouted a little louder. If I hadn’t been lying prone I would have jumped about a foot in the air when I heard a response. It was Bryan’s voice, whispering, but still audible.\n\n“Come in.”\n\nThe tension snapped and unleashed a shudder through my body. It definitely sounded like Bryan. And despite the wave of fear, I started to crawl forward. One arm over the other, into the gap.\n\nI was nearly halfway through when I started to question what the hell I was doing. Now that I was closer, I still couldn’t see Bryan’s shoes, or any other evidence that he was there. The height of the gap had definitely shrunk over time, perhaps due to the building settling under the weight of years of students. Though most of that perceived shrinkage was certainly me growing. Either way, it wasn’t the easy task I remembered it being. I dragged my body forward, my shirt getting caught between my chest and the rough floor as I tried to inch towards the end of the tunnel.\n\n“Bryan, what the fuck!?” I spat almost involuntarily, my breathing growing quick and shallow. I could smell the concentrated must and petrichor from decades of rotting detritus on either side of me. The roof felt like it sagged a little closer to me as I slowly scrambled forward. Again I heard what sounded like Bryan, just on the other side of the squeeze.\n\n“Almost there.”\n\nIt definitely sounded like Bryan whispering. But it shouldn’t have been him. It sounded like my memory of Bryan. The same pre-pubescent voice I remembered him having back in school.\n\nFinally, I saw pale moonlight grow closer and I pulled myself into the Secret Place. I rolled onto my back, collecting myself as I stared up at the gray clouds framed by those familiar four high walls. My clothes were totally ruined, and my chest was scraped up to boot, and starting to ache. But I had made it. I rose to my feet, opening my phone’s flashlight to take in my surroundings.\n\nThe Secret Place was just as we had left it. I half expected Bryan to be standing behind me and grab my shoulder to scare the wits out of me, but he was nowhere to be seen. I stacked two of the milk crates on top of each other and sat down. I started shivering. It had either gotten colder, or I was just realizing how cold it was.\n\n“Hey Bryan, I’m here. What the hell do you want from me?” I called out to nothing in particular. \n\n“Stay with me.” \n\nI heard the whispering voice again, closer this time. It felt like it was coming from directly behind me, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I jolted forward involuntarily, pointing my meager phone light behind me to see where the voice was coming from, but there was nothing there.\n\nThe voice was different this time. I could hear the same voice I remembered as Bryan’s, but there were other voices mixed in as well. One was higher, it sounded like Jess, or my memory of her at least. The other voice was another kid’s. I can only assume it was mine.\n\nI moved my light around the space as I frantically turned to see if anyone was there. I was alone, but turning my phone’s light to the walls, I revealed the old pen drawings and scribbles we had made all those years ago. I recalled the broad shapes of the words we had written. I had started on the far left of one of the walls, writing out logs of our secret meetings. In other places were lyrics to rhymes about our least favorite teachers, notes we would leave for each other, and descriptions of the fantasy worlds we made together. So many stories written in faded black on the peeling white paint. As I got closer to the paragraphs, I saw that they were different. All the text we had written was gone, replaced by a single repeating phrase.\n\nstay here stay here stay here stay here stay here stay here\n\nIt was repeated hundreds, thousands of times, on every wall, replacing all the words we had written.\n\nOn the far wall in the middle, where Jess had written our Secret Names in a flowing calligraphy with stars and flowers around them, there was now only \n\nSTAY HERE\n\nSTAY HERE\n\nSTAY HERE\n\nNot only was the text changed, but the old doodles we made also seemed to have taken on strange new forms. Each childlike sketch seemed to be warped, not only by the flow of time and the erosion of the elements, but by some strange venom seeping through from below the surface. Castles that had stood nobly atop hills were now crumbling, their stick figure inhabitants curled up and dead of famine, dotting the hillsides. Jess had drawn a series of cats and birds which now appeared pleading and emaciated, staring out with dull eyes. Bryan’s robots were rusted and dark.\n\nThe three of us had covered one of the shorter walls with a drawing of a snake, but the thing that occupied the space now was more sinister. Its body coiled into a dark spiraling mass that seemed both horrible and familiar. The twisted facsimile grinned at me with white pin-prick eyes and a grin filled with uncountable needle-like teeth.\n\nI nearly dropped my phone to the ground, and recoiled as if it was going to jump out of the walls and grab me. Thinking fast, I grabbed the three milk crates and quickly stacked them on top of each other, leaping onto them to try to get enough height to grasp the top of the wall and climb out. I only succeeded in kicking the entire stack out from under me and landing hard on my side.\n\nRolling over in pain, I shouted for Bryan again, more desperately this time. After receiving no response but silence once more, I remembered one of our cardinal rules. In the Secret Place, we could only use our Secret Names.\n\n“Lava Hawk?” I called out questioningly into the cold air. Again, there was no response. As lame as they sounded to me as an adult, there was no way I could forget our Secret Names.\n\nI called it out again, a little louder. Once more, it was swallowed by the silence. Just as I was about to try a third time, I heard something from the gap. It was far away, just a grunt, like someone crawling through the gap, but it was human. I turned to the gap and peered through.\n\nThere wasn’t anything there, just the few distant lights of the school buildings and the darkness between me and them. I shouted again into the gap.\n\n“Lava Hawk! Bryan! Answer me!”\n\nI could have sworn I heard something whispering, but it might have been a rustle of dry leaves. At this point, I had had enough. Whatever was going on, I had to get out, and now. I started to crawl forward into the gap.\n\nAgain, it was a tight fit. I had to keep my head turned to the right, only straining my neck to look forward when necessary. One limb at a time, I moved forward, clawing my body inch by inch towards escape. The cold ground below me pressed new, painful patterns into my cheek with every inch I gained.\n\nI tried to turn my head forward to see the exit, but it was gone. Only blackness lay ahead. My heart began racing even faster. Surely one of the lights just went out, or a cloud passed in front of the moon, or someone had put the board back over the entrance, or my eyes hadn’t yet adjusted back to the dark. The dark that pressed in around me from all sides. One limb at a time, I continued my crawl. I felt my skin tear as it scraped along the asphalt.\n\nI had to move my right arm up against my body to see behind me. The Secret Place was similarly engulfed by darkness. I was alone. I screamed, wheezing, choking screams, hoping anyone could hear me, but they just echoed hollow into the darkness. I continued crawling forward, pushing through the pain of my body scraping against the rough floor and roof, doing anything to move forward.\n\nIt felt like the space was growing tighter, like I was caught in a vice grip that was being slowly tightened. My chest and head were getting pinned as I struggled to push myself to freedom. My throat aching from screaming, I could only choke and spit fruitlessly against the foul air.\n\nSomewhere within me I knew I should have reached the end of the tunnel by now. I had done this hundreds of times as a kid, I knew exactly how long it took to crawl through. I tried to ignore this feeling as long as I could, staring frantically into the darkness before me for any familiar shape. Eventually all I could do was sob. Between the sound of my own exhausted body scraping forward, I heard something else in the distance. It was a faint scraping sound from somewhere deeper within, that only served to riddle my mind with images of a long scaly belly dragging itself around deep within the confines of the tunnel, and a maw lined with teeth.\n\nAfter a long time alone in darkness, I heard something else – a voice. \n\n“Storm Clover?” a man’s weak voice called out from somewhere ahead of me.\n\n“Bryan? Lava Hawk?” I called into the darkness, straining my neck to look forward.\n\nThe voice gave a laughing sigh of relief. I sensed the shape of another person in the darkness.\n\n“Oh my god James is that you?” He sounded, thankfully, like a normal adult, but it was undeniably Bryan. I crawled forward with renewed strength. “What are you doing here?”\n\n“You told me to come here dude, what the hell is going on?” I said, reaching my arm forward to grasp him. He grabbed mine. I could feel dried blood on his palms.\n\n“I got a text from Jess saying to come here. We can catch up later though, do you know how to get the hell out of here?”\n\n“I… I don’t know” I didn’t want to admit we were trapped, fearing that speaking it would make it true. “We’ll find a way out if we keep moving forward”.\n\n“But which way is forward? You’re trying to leave the Secret Place too, right?” He asked. My stomach dropped. Had we really somehow met up going opposite directions? I could no longer pretend to have a logical explanation for whatever was going on.\n\n“Yeah, I – I don’t know which way is out, I don’t know how long I’ve been down here. I don’t-” I started to trail off as my breathing quickened.\n\n“Ok, stay calm, we can figure it out.” Bryan said, holding my hand. “Let’s try moving this way, it feels a little less tight. Worst case scenario, we hit a wall that we can move along.” He motioned our hands to the side.\n\nI took slow breaths, as deep as I could manage. “Okay, you lead the way.”\n\n“Just keep close to me and we’ll make it out” He said as we shifted our bodies to crawl in the new direction.\n\nWe both wanted it to be true, and we didn’t really have another choice. We continued forward, inch by inch. To distract ourselves, we talked about high school, our careers, what we were doing now. It wasn’t the easiest conversation to have physically, but it distracted us from the crushing weight of the gap squeezing around us. Bryan was just as I remembered, able to crack a joke even in the worst situation imaginable.\n\nI wasn’t sure if I was just hallucinating from exhaustion, but it seemed like he was right. The tunnel felt like it was slightly wider here. Or at least it felt like chatting made the slow crawl a little easier. After what felt like hours, we heard something faint ahead of us. Somewhere in the distance there was another voice. A woman’s voice, shouting our names.\n\n“Is that Jess?” Bryan asked.\n\n“What direction is it coming from? Can you see her?” I was struggling to breathe, but hearing the voice gave me a boost of adrenaline, and more importantly, hope.\n\n“I think I see something, follow me.” He continued to crawl forward into the black abyss. I followed behind him, trying to keep in contact so I wouldn’t lose him in the darkness. Jess’ shouts grew louder, and we yelled back to her. My last ounce of strength was used to push my burning muscles forward, towards her voice.\n\nEventually I reached my hand out, and it was met by another.\n\n“I got you!” Jess pulled me out as Bryan grabbed my other hand. They pulled me free from the gap and we all collapsed to the floor, breathing haggardly. I rolled over, my eyes squinting against the pale moonlight shining down on the three of us.\n\n“What the hell were you thinking?” Jess stood over me, accusingly. “You start talking to me out of the blue and then send me some weird ass message about the Secret Place and I show up to find the two of you…” She trailed off, looking over our dirty, bloodied clothes. “What even happened in there?”\n\n“I don’t know, and I don’t want to find out.” Bryan rose to his feet, shakily. The front of his clothes looked like they were ripped to shreds from being dragged across pavement for hours, dark spots of blood dotting his graphic tee and jeans.\n\nWith some effort, I got up as well. “Let’s get the hell out of here. Whatever’s in there can stay there.”\n\nAs we turned to leave, I shared a glance with Bryan. Beneath the dirt, scrapes, blood, and facial hair I saw the same friend I had once known. I could tell from his eyes he saw me the same way. We snuck off campus, meeting under a streetlight near where I had parked. We discussed what had happened, then started just talking about what had been going on in the years since we had last seen each other. After a while, we were back to laughing together like it was old times.\n\nAt home, I took a long hot shower and tended to my scraped skin. As far away as it already seemed that night, the pain kept it real. Even now, it feels like just another distant memory. We don't talk about it, Bryan, Jess, and I, but we all remember. The secret is safe with us.",

        "text": "By all rights, it should've been your typical Wednesday evening. I’d just clocked off and I was headed homewards. I'd been working at the bottleyard for the past seven years, and every day was always the same as the one that came before it. Apart from *that* Wednesday.\n\nI'd decided I'd take a shortcut through the abandoned lot next door. It's been empty for at least a decade. Sometimes junkies used it as a discrete spot to shoot smack undisturbed, but since they put up the cameras and the metal sheets in the windows, it's a lot more quiet.\n\nAs I was walking passed a skip filled with debris, I heard a strange rattling sound from inside of it, like some kinda creature trapped underneath the trash. I stopped. I've got a great sympathy for animals, I've always found them a lot kinder and easier to understand than people. So, I made my way over to see if I could be of any assistance.\n\nLifting up a rusted piece of corrugated iron, I saw it, and I'll never forget it, not as long as I live.\n\nThere, lying in amongst the scrap, was a severed arm.\n\nI recoiled immediately. I did not fancy getting involved. No thank you. That was certainly a human arm, a blind man could've spotted it a mile off. A stump, a hand and fingers, all 5 of them. Clean too, which was surprising considering it was in the trash, and probably used to belong to some smack head who forgot to pay up.\n\nThen it twitched.\n\nI saw the fingers curl, moving with intention. It was trying to make symbols and shapes. It was trying to communicate.\n\nStanding there, in my Cat work boots, rooted to the ground in shock, I recalled something. I'd taken an extra college class in sign language, way back, and some of the symbols it was making seemed *pretty* familiar. So, I looked harder, and I tried to translate what the arm was saying.\n\nThe signs were jerky and sloppy, it had clearly sustained some damage in the severing. But it was easy enough for me to make out the few words it was repeating.\n\n\"Help,\" \"me,\" and \"please\".\n\nI was totally lost for what to do next. There I was, utterly alone, in an abandoned smack head hangout, with a severed arm that was trying to converse with me in standard British Sign Language.\n\nThis is something else, I thought, this is really something else. And, I'm ashamed to admit, I also thought about running, and ignoring its messages completely. But I stayed, and I took a step forward, knelt beside it, and tried to talk to it.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I signed back, \"Who are you? How did this happen to you?\" Stupid I know, and of course, the arm didn't respond. How could it? It was just an arm, it couldn't *see* me.\n\nIt just kept signing the same thing over, and over again. \"Help me. Help me. Help me.\"\n\nJesus, I didn't know what to do with the thing. But I did know that I couldn't just leave the poor arm out there in a skip.\n\nSo, I did the only thing I could think to do. I picked it up, I wrapped it in my jacket and I cradled it in my arms like a baby. I could feel it panic and twist, squirming and fighting against my hold. But, as I began to rock it back and forth, it started to calm down a little.\n\nI couldn't stay here, so I walked towards my house. As I walked, I noticed the arm was trying to sign again, not that I was paying too much attention, my focus was mainly trained more on making sure no one saw me with a disembodied limb.\n\nI was almost home when I noticed the arm'd started behaving a little differently. The fingers had curled up, and in the centre of its palm, small red bumps were pushing their way through the skin. They just kept coming, more and more of them, until they'd created a raised surface with a little gap in the middle.\n\n\"Jesus christ!\" I whispered to it. \"Are you alright? What the hell's happening to you?\" I knew the arm couldn't hear me, but I couldn't help talking to it.\n\nThe raised spotty patches kept pushing themselves up further, making the gap in the centre of the palm even more pronounced. Then the spotty surface pushed itself too far, and tore a gaping hole right in the middle of the palm.\n\n“Christ alive!” I said, “what, are you giving birth?”\n\nOn closer inspection, I saw it had formed itself a rudimentary pair of lips.\n\nI had stopped dead in my tracks, and was now staring down at the arm, my own mouth hanging open in shock.\n\nThen the lips began to move, and a voice tumbled out, high and raspy.\n\n\"Please,\" it said, \"Help me. Please.\"\n\n\"Help you? How? Jesus wept, how can I help? Please, tell me how!\"\n\nThe arm and its newly acquired lips, did not answer. It simply repeated itself, over and over, becoming more agitated and loud with each cycle. \"Help me. Please help me.\"\n\n\"Please,\" it said, louder still\n\n\"Help me. Please.\" the words became less important than the volume, it was almost shouting now.\n\n\"Please,\" it screamed, \"Please, HELP ME! PLEASE!\"\n\nAnd then, it dispensed with words entirely, and started shrieking like a banshee.\n\nThis was bad.\n\nThis was gonna draw some attention that I did not want. How would I explain why I was walking round with a screaming severed arm.\n\nI didn't want any trouble. So, I shoved the sleeve of my jacket over its mouth and pressed the fabric down inside with my fingers, muting its cries.\n\nAnd it bit me.\n\nThe damn thing had teeth, and it bit me with them, and in my pain I wanted to scream too.\n\nI ran the rest of the way back home, holding the cloth inside of its mouth, and all the while it was still biting down on my hand. I must've looked crazy, but I don't think anyone saw or heard me.\n\nWhen I got home, I put the disembodied arm down on the table. And, just for a second, I removed the jacket sleeve from its mouth. It started screaming again instantly. Hastily I shoved the fabric right back between its lips. this time I wrapped it up completely, and bound the fabric fixed in place with some elastic bands and string. It worked much better than my fingers, but I could still hear it, a little.\n\nThe next few days went by in a blur. From that point on, I always took the long way home from work. And, when I got back inside, and I felt I wanted to have a drink to unwind, I would open the fridge.\n\nInside, between the condiments, the beers and the half-empty takeout boxes; wriggling and softly screaming into its fabric muffler. The arm.\n\nJust yesterday, I noticed new bumps appearing on it, in the shape of an ear.\n\nI haven’t got the foggiest clue what to do with it, but I know I can't keep it here.",

        "text": " \n\nHi, so to start this off, this obviously didn't happen today. It happened one year ago when a girl in my apartment complex invited my daughter(15F) to her birthday party. Now I will admit, I've always been a bit judgemental, the kid is turning 16 and still plays dress up. I didn't want my daughter to think this is normal behavior, and I forbid her from going since the party was a costume party with a \"miraculous ladybug\" theme.\n\nI've always hated the birthday girl, she would play at the apartment basketball court in cosplay and go skating around it often, she would go to the swingset and play as if she was still a child. She isn't normal, most kids her age do more mature things in order to have fun. It was like she didn't care, I tried telling the apartment owners about her behavior, but they brushed it off as \"a child being a child\" and let her be.\n\nI decided that I needed to talk about my issues with her personally. I sat down with her at the basketball court and talked to her about why her behavior upset me. She apologized and said she thought this could be related to me being upset over not being able to connect to my inner child. I was offended at first and stormed off, but once I told my husband, he agreed with her.\n\nI decided to meet with her again at my home this time, she was very polite but refused the banana pudding I offered her. That hurt my feelings, but I brushed it off. We had a nice conversation and I realized a bit about myself. I decided to let my daughter go to the party, we even picked out a fun costume of a character called Chloe from the show the party was themed of. \n\nI decided as a personal gift I would give the birthday girl some cheesecake, as I know she loves it due to my daughter telling me about what she likes for gifts. I made her a banana cheesecake because I absolutely love bananas. I must admit, I still felt a bit of resentment toward her for how she is just able to connect to her inner child. I know it's harsh to be jealous of a 16-year-old at 46 but I just wish I could feel as happy and youthful as she is. \n\nI set the cheesecake on the table at the party and it was extremely fun. It soon was time to open the gifts and she was very happy to see the cheesecake, she ran up to me and hugged me once I told her I made it for her. I still remember her telling me that she was happy we didn't have any harsh feelings for each other. I know it sounds stupid but at that moment I realized I had misjudged her. This youthful, kind and forgiving soul was NOT a bad influence. \n\nShe was just a kid who wanted to have fun, and I guess in today's world, seeing that was so shocking to me that I misdirected my anger about my own inability to connect with my youth at this child. As I sat and realized how my jealousy had truly blocked my senses, I was broken from my thought by the sounds of screaming and choking.\n\nThat's when I remembered. She told me why she didn't want my banana pudding. She's allergic to bananas. I had been so angered by her youth that I had decided to capture her in it forever. It was too late by the time she was in the hospital. No one knows that I knew she was allergic to bananas. Her parents said it was not my fault. My daughter and husband say it was not my fault. But every time I hear the rusty old park swings from my apartment at night, I look down out the window where I can see the community park, I see her, sitting, still smiling in her miraculous ladybug costume, swaying with the swing as it blows her back and forth. She waves at me like nothing is wrong because she doesn't even know she's gone. \n\nIt's my fault.",

I decided to meet with her again at my home this time, she was very polite but refused the banana pudding I offered her. That hurt my feelings, but I brushed it off. We had a nice conversation and I realized a bit about myself. I decided to let my daughter go to the party, we even picked out a fun costume of a character called Chloe from the show the party was themed of. I decided as a personal gift I would give the birthday girl some cheesecake, as I know she loves it due to my daughter telling me about what she likes for gifts. I made her a banana cheesecake because I absolutely love bananas. I must admit, I still felt a bit of resentment toward her for how she is just able to connect to her inner child. I know it's harsh to be jealous of a 16-year-old at 46 but I just wish I could feel as happy and youthful as she does. I set the cheesecake on the table at the party and it was extremely fun. It soon was time to open the gifts and she was very happy to see the cheesecake, she ran up to me and hugged me once I told her I made it for her. I still remember her telling me that she was happy we didn't have any harsh feelings for each other. I know it sounds stupid but at that moment I realized I had misjudged her. This youthful, kind and forgiving soul was NOT a bad influence. She was just a kid who wanted to have fun, and I guess in today's world, seeing that was so shocking to me that I misdirected my anger about my own inability to connect with my youth at this child. As I sat and realized how my jealousy had truly blocked my senses, I was broken from my thought by the sounds of screaming and choking. That's when I remembered. She told me why she didn't want my banana pudding. She's allergic to bananas. I had been so angered by her youth that I had decided to capture her in it forever. It was too late by the time she was in the hospital. No one knows that I knew she was allergic to bananas. Her parents said it was not my fault. My daughter and husband say it was not my fault. But every time I hear the rusty old park swings from my apartment at night, I look down out the window where I can see the community park, I see her, sitting, still smiling in her miraculous ladybug costume, swaying with the swing as it blows her back and forth. She waves at me like nothing is wrong because she doesn't even know she's gone. It's my fault.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fnral/whimper_part_1/)\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nPart 2\n____________________________________________________\n\nI live a lifetime staring into those inverted eyes.\n\nIt’s like staring into a blob of tar burning without gravity. There’s a flame there, but there’s no urgency to it; it’s like a pair of flickers glowing behind stained and sooted glass. It’s not the white and blue flame of a torch cutting through me, it’s the steady flame of a wick telling me that it will smolder across the world if that’s what it takes to burn through me as well.\n\nThat lifetime ends, and my wendigo and I are running again. I’ve seen him, but he’s seen my tower, and I know where he’s running. He’s closer than my horizon, so I know I don’t have time. I have to turn around, I have to take three steps, I have to close the door and barricade it; I don’t have time.\n\nStill, I have to try. I’m already pushing off the ground as I turn for the door. It looks a mile away, but my body surges across the distance in only two steps, passing through the open arch with my third.\n\nMy binoculars are in my left hand, and the door is on my right. I grab the edge of the door with my right hand, and as soon as I’m past it, I throw it closed behind me, pressing hard from the soles of my feet to launch my body against the solid steel. I hear the latch set, and I reach up with my hand to turn the deadbolt.\n\n“I must already be dead.”\n\nThe words flash through my mind. With everything that Dianne told me, there’s no way that I was able to get back inside, there’s no way that I got that door closed, there’s no way that I’m still alive. \n\nMaybe that’s what hell is; an eternity of trying to protect yourself from the thing that already killed you. Maybe that’s what I am now; just the memory of a dead guy who tried to save himself.\n\nIf that’s what I am, I may as well get started. \n\nI think that I could barricade the door. I could knock over the refrigerator and shove it in front of the door. Then I could do the same with the washing machine. Then, if I still had time, I could shove the freezer from out in the garage in front of the door, too, along with that straight-piped Pontiac my grandpa always reminisced about.\n\n“You live in a tower, Rapunzel,” flashes through my mind, “you don’t own anything heavy.”\n\nI have a rifle, a bolt action .308 with a scope. I can drop deer, elk, bear if I have to with that rifle. It’s not going to help. I remember that, Dianne’s words repeating over and over in my head, growing clearer and clearer with every pass. The rifle is useless, death is its natural state, making it more dead won’t make it less dangerous.\n\n“You’re real brave now,” my handset chirps, Joel’s voice is responding to my lack of trust, “But you tell me how brave you feel when you're naked and a black bear is drooling while he stares at you from a nearby tree. Over.” I reach for the CB radio to turn it off, stretching to keep a hand on the door. I end up pushing it off the back of the table, but the illuminated display goes dark as the battery pack falls out of its slot. I slam my back into the door again, digging my feet into the floor and pleading with the concept of hope for an option.\n\nI can’t kill it. If I’m going to survive this, I’m going to have to take away its weapons. It’s faster than a bad thought, it’s stronger than the rock and the hard place, it’s hungrier than famine. I’m going to die, I won’t survive this, but if I’m going to try, then I’m going to have to try to take it apart.\n\nI try to plan, but I can’t focus; my mind is racing through a dozen questions at once. Joel’s words, “You’re real brave now …” and some other stuff after that. My mind thinks that it might just be something Joel knows how to do, then my mind tells me that’s stupid. My mind thinks that might have been Joel that I saw through my binoculars, then my mind tells me that’s stupid. My mind thinks that I need to get back to that whole “taking apart a wendigo” thing I was just thinking about.\n\nThere’s a machete on the side of my alice pack.\n\nI almost realize that when the world explodes.\n___________________________________________________\n\nPart 3\n___________________________________________________\n\nMy eyes are on the alice pack as my vision starts to spin. I feel my shins fold over my feet as the door explodes inward. My ear presses into my knee as my doubled body flips through the room. My eyes are still on the alice pack. \n\nMaybe, if I just could have gotten to that machete.\n\nThe alice pack is upside down and behind me as my back crashes into the table top. There are no legs underneath; it’s hinged to the inside of the wall to save space when not in use. Some of my ribs crack as my tumbling mess puts it to use.\n\nMy thighs crush into my chest for a fraction of a moment before bouncing off my lungs and springing back out on my hips. The backs of my legs shatter window glass on their way to colliding with the inside of a shutter, and then the whole mess of me falls straight down, onto my head, before plopping out sideways and neatly tucking in like a baseboard at the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe alice pack is gone, and I’m staring at the doorway. The door is still slamming open, a broad cannon shot of light punching it in. My mind must be failing; I’m hopeful that I’m only fighting against the light. I’ve never done that before. I don’t know what would make me think I could do it now. \n\nThe door bounces off the inside wall and starts to close again, and that’s when I see him; my wendigo. He sneaks in through the latch side of the doorway, like he’s ducking in behind a server when he’s not supposed to be in the kitchen. He’s rotating as he comes through the door, grabbing it with his hand and slamming it shut while he slides his body out of the way in a single, elegantly vicious movement.\n\nOne of the vegetable cans I had been stacking rolls in front of the door as he slams, and it bends in the bottom corner of the door as it latches. The triangular beam that shoots across the floor is my only remaining light. For an instant, I think to try and shoo it away, like it’s a fly trying to land on my face. I think it’s going to tell him right where I am.\n\nHe grabs the book shelf that sits just to the right of the door instead. It’s a three shelf thing that stands about hip high. It’s meant to stay out of the way of one of the windows so I’d have a better view. It’s made from leftover plywood that was brought up to finish the inside of the tower, and it has no back. My wendigo sets it in front of the door and holds it down as he tries to jam it into place with kicks.\n\nHe goes back for the books. I say books, but what I really mean is binders, like the three ring ones from school. They’re the same thing as the course material I had to study, left at my tower so I could be free to forget what I’d learned. There’s five of them, and they're all lightly filled. He grabs them by the spines and shoves them in the gap of the door jam in five places.\n\nI feel my chest trying to pull in air, but I don’t know if I’m breathing. I’m trying to understand why he would do that, why he would jam the doors. I’m trying to think of a reason that makes sense, one that makes it okay, because the only reason I can think of is that he doesn’t want me escaping. \n\nIf he thinks I can escape, that’s because he thinks this is going to take a while. \n\nMy triangular beam is still pointing across the floor, so I can still see as he cuts across the room to the left side of the door. He rips the bedding off the mattress and throws it behind him, back where the bookshelf had been, then he covers the bedding with the mattress. \n\nHe tries to pull the bedframe off the floor, but it’s hinged to the wall just like the table. He stumbles with it for a step, then he rips it loose from the hinges. He stabs the foot of the frame into the corner where the bookshelf and the door meet, then he jams the head of the frame into a beam under the roof.\n\nMy throat is burning. I think he’s going to use that to hang me.\n\nHe tears into my cupboards, shoving everything into those shelves by the door, before ripping the cupboards down and jamming them in front of the bookshelf. \n\nA strange thing is thought in my mind; he can’t see me. It’s not a helpful thought. I know he’s still going to find me. It’s a room on top of a tower; I’m either going to be right where he’s looking, or I’m going to be in the other spot.\n\nHe grabs the mattress and props it up in front of the shelving pile, and then he grabs the bedding that was underneath. He stands with his back to the pile and sits down. He presses his feet into the floor, and shoves his back into the mattress. He grabs one of my pillow cases and shoves a can in it before something catches his eye.\n\nHe locks eyes with me. He stops. His head cocks to the side like a puppy looking at a water fountain.\n\nWe are thoroughly confused.",

        "text": "“I saw one of them again last night.”\n\nOne week away from land on a small cargo ship and Adam’s stories didn’t age any better in saltwater. \n\n“Seven, maybe eight feet tall. Standing on the waves. Watching us. Watching the boat.”\n\nThe dude was a virus that nobody on deck wanted to catch. He was a deckhand by trade but the Captain banished him to cleanup duty. His fellow crew cracked jokes at his expense. Nobody wanted to work with him. Nobody wanted to talk to him. Ultimately his station fell so low that he ended up in the mess hall, with me, the cook. Funny how shit rolls even on a ship.\n\n“People think I’m crazy,” he continued that morning with a wistful eye out the window. “You can say it. Jack already did. He’s off his meds. He’s detoxing. It’s whatever. Fuck it. Doesn’t matter. I’ve heard it all before - from you guys, from my parents, name it. We’ll find out soon enough.”\n\nThe sureness in his voice baited me to ask a little further. \n\n“Alright,” I offered. “What do you think you saw?”\n\nHe took to the question like a life raft. I think he was glad somebody would just listen. \n\n“I don’t even know what to call it,” he answered carefully. “A jumper, maybe, hydro-jumper or something.”\n\n“A waterwalker,” I suggested. “I heard some of the guys joking…”\n\n“The cameras can’t capture enough light out there,” he whined. “The radar fucks up. Only thing that works is binoculars… and even that only lasts for a second. Too many jumps”\n\nI went to get us some coffee from the counter.\n \n“I finally got one good look last night,” he called after me. “Out there on the waves. Just looming there like a fuckin’ titan. Humanoid but not human. Long arms, long legs, maybe a tail or something at the back to keep balance. Big, like I said, bigger than you or me. And I don’t know how fast.”\n\nThe pot beeped.\n\n“I tried to track one of them with radar. I wanted something visual to show everyone, you know, hard data instead of me just talking shit. But it didn’t *like* that.”\n\nI snorted.\n\n“What didn’t it like?”\n\nHe stared back at me. He waited for me to fidget awkwardly with the coffee. Then he answered.\n\n“The radar. IT didn’t like radar. The scanner jumped up and down, you know, back and forth, back and forth. I would catch this thing in one spot - only to have it pop up a mile west a second later. Then it would hop back again. I’ve never seen anything like it. I don’t know if the track worked and something scrambled or if IT is just… *fast*. You know? Really fucking fast.”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“What’s that quote?” he wondered aloud. “‘If you stare long enough into the void, it stares back at you’?”\n\n He shuddered and snatched the hot cup of coffee from my hand. \n\n“I think we’re getting a little dramatic, here…” I started. “You said...”\n\nHe grabbed me.\n\n“No. You don’t fucking get it. Nobody gets it. Last night, on deck, I could feel the void, Matt. I could feel it looking right into my chest cavity and wrapping around all the muscles and blood vessels in there. I could feel this *cold*… freezing cold you know… and all I can remember thinking is that I didn’t want to ever be cold like that again. Have you ever felt that way? An impenetrable cold? I can feel it right now. It’s sixty fuckin’ degrees in here.”\n\nHe cradled the cup.\n\n“So what happened?” I asked. “Did you track it?”\n\n“No. I tried. I couldn’t track it. It wouldn’t let me. Then it started to move closer….” he looked at the floor. “It *looked* at me… it *saw* me…. With bright green eyes. Like a lizard, you know, right through the scope.”\n\nHe gulped.\n\n“I went inside and locked the door. Haven’t seen anything since.”\n\nI let him sip for a few seconds before piecing together my reply carefully. I wanted to let him down easy. Nobody on board seemed to have the conscience necessary to do it.\n\n“This is going to sound really arrogant,” I sighed. “But I have been out on the water for a long time. You’re not the first guy to say he’s seen something. You won’t be the last. It’s dark at night. Darker than anything you have ever experienced before. That darkness has a way of pulling people in and there isn’t a spec of land in any direction. So no. I don’t think you’re crazy. People see things.”\n\nAdam nodded violently. He felt vindicated. That made the next part much harder.\n\n“But you gotta understand how this stuff makes people uncomfortable. When you talk about it all the time… when you insist on the truth in it…  we live in a day and age where society has figured out all of the mysteries. There's nothing left out there to discover. There’s no monsters or voids. That shit is all pieced together in your brain to deal with the harsh reality of the unknown.”\n\nThe wind picked up.\n\n“There’s nothing out there but sea and fish,” I finished. “Maybe some rocks. A shit ton of garbage. But that’s it. Mostly just sea and fish.”\n\nThe radio cackled with orders to do something for someone. I felt relieved of the conversation and disappeared into a corner to occupy myself with breakfast. Adam let me go without another word.\n\nThe rest of the day moved like any other. Lunch came and went with dinner not long after it. The “normal” folks on deck had five modes - work, eat, sleep, drink, or fish. The second kept me busy and the last kept us all fed. Everybody contributed. Everyone except Adam. Hence the hatred from everyone else on board.\n\nThat night, on Captain’s orders, I circled the ship to find my disheveled buddy on a chair on deck under the stars. He had a pair of binoculars at the ready and the same outfit he wore all day. I wondered when he last showered.\n\n“You know they got Anna up in the tower tonight,” I offered loudly to announce my presence. “Are you backing her up?”\n\nAdam answered without looking away.\n\n“She misses shit.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“And you don’t?”\n\nHe considered that. \n\n“Backup,” he answered. “Like you said.”\n\nI nodded and pulled up a second chair behind him. \n\n“Buddy, it’s past midnight.”\n\n“Shut the fuck up a second.”\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\nHe grabbed my arm. \n\n“I’m sorry, just, look.”\n\nHe handed me the lenses and pointed to a speck of the horizon. I zoomed in and did my best to pinpoint the spot. But the only thing that stood out to me were waves. Countless waves and a blanket of black behind it.\n\n“I don’t see anything.”\n\nHe snatched the binoculars back out of my hand. \n\n“It was right there.”\n\nI sighed.\n\n“Man…”\n\nAdam stood and pointed a finger aggressively, as if he hoped to poke the damn thing in the night, then he shouted - \n\n“RIGHT THERE.”\n\nTo the point that his voice carried and the observation deck threw up a light. I grabbed him around the shoulders and led him back down to the bunks. He fought me for a little bit. Then sheer exhaustion took hold. \n\nInside, I shucked off his shoes like a drunk in college. I tossed him into bed. I found his bed sheets, neatly kept and folded, beside a small stash of books and maps organized by size. I turned off the light on my way out the door, and just before the frame clicked, a voice whispered - \n\n“Wait.”\n\nI did.\n\n“Lock it for me,” Adam muttered. “Will you?”\n\nThe Captain and mates had keys. I thought about saying as much. But I supposed he wasn’t worried much about them as much as whatever he thought might be coming. I nodded in the dark and clicked the cheap Kwikset. Just before I left, he called out again. \n\n“Lock yours too.”\n\nMy room was right next door. But something about the glow of moonlight through the windows in the hallway drew me back up top. I sat on deck a while, in Adam’s chair, and investigated the shapes on the horizon just as he did. I kept expecting to see something. Maybe a boat or a whale that would explain away his worries. Maybe something would jump out at me. But ‘it’ never did, so I just sat there a bit. The waves looked peaceful when they crashed up against the ship. \n\nOne turned into two AM. Sleep finally started to seem more likely. I slipped back downstairs to bed and passed Adam’s cabin on the way. I listened carefully to the reassuring sound of him sleeping off the paranoia. Then I found my own room and dimmed the lights.\n\nTwo turned into three AM. I read on my phone. I tried to sleep but the silence of the ship made me uncomfortable. I took off my clothes and decided on a late shower. Halfway in between finding a towel and a razor blade, my eyes fell on the lock. I hesitated for a second. I thought about it. Then I clicked it forward.\n\nThe hot water of the shower washed away Adam and all of his problems. My mind switched to the following day and its many different headaches. I wrestled in between breakfast quesadillas and body wash when suddenly, oddly, I heard something. \n\nI still can’t quite identify the noise that first caught my attention. The whistling of the shower obscured most sounds. But that crash or bang got me out from under the water in a hurry. I wrapped a towel around my waist and whisper-walked my way around the corner. \n\nThe door handle caught my attention.\n\nThe lock jiggled in a pattern. Two to the left. Two to the right. I stood still as a ghost in a white towel, scared of breathing for fear of alerting whatever might be on the other side. Two to the left, two to the right. Over and over again for about a minute.\n\nHeavy footsteps retreated from the doorway. I felt safe enough to whisper-walk towards my golf clubs. The footsteps stopped again. A faint jiggle of a lock echoed in the hall. I listened and cursed my breath for being so goddamn loud.\n\nTwo the left, two the right. Stop. Two to the left, two the right. Stop. Again for a minute. The heavy footsteps moved on and a high-pitched ringing followed behind. I gathered what remained of my courage and gently unclicked the lock.\n\nA door opened. I opened mine. \n\nI peeked outside just in time to see a shadow enter a room down the hall. \n\nThe door closed. I closed mine. \n\nI hopped over - feet still dripping - to the closest wall. Adam’s bunk was in between us and the third room and he was no longer snoring. I wondered if he was listening too. There was a loud THUD. Then a shuffle of feet. More ringing. A door opened soon after and I rushed to slip open mine. \n\nI only saw a silhouette. A shape that disappeared in seconds. It was huge. About eight feet tall. Long legs. Long arms. No tail. It dragged someone behind him, a crew member we later learned to be Jack, then turned a corner and went up the stairs to the deck. \n\nI didn’t follow. \n\nThe slow and heavy footsteps turned into a gallop against the floorboards. A couple other guys reported hearing a high-pitched shriek. The running ended in a splash. And then it was silent.\n\n‘\n\nThe man overboard alarm sounded a full five minutes after we roused the ship.\n\nThe Coast Guard launched a broad search that scanned the surrounding ocean for a full week. Nobody found Jack. Rescue services theorized he was suicidal. The Captain insisted he fell. The crew heard something… but most people couldn’t agree as to what.\n\nI thought about telling our story. I assumed Adam would do the dirty work. But when I caught him in the mess that morning, he just smiled at me, fresh as a bird, and poured a fresh pot of coffee.\n\n“Did you hear who it took?”\n\nI nodded carefully.\n\n“Who’s fucking crazy now?”",

        "text": " In a time long ago, long before your oldest ancestors started keeping a recording of their lives, there was a war.  This was a war between chaos and order. Of the rational scientific mind just forming in the human collective consciousness, and the magic that had ruled the Earth before.\n\nMagic had always been, and would always be, the defender of the Earth.  Whether you are talking about witches who were natural healers of the Earth, who kept balance between the realms of the Natural and the Human, the predators who ensured that no species took too much rank and power for themselves, or the beings of pure magic who embodied the spirit of the Earth. From Gods and Goddess to Gnomes and Glawackus, they were here to preserve our home planet, and ensure that nothing moved out of balance.\n\nHumans, being humans, did not like the constraints that these creatures put on their lives.  What right did these creatures have to tell them what to do with their lands?  What right did these creatures have to stop them from ensuring their tribe’s security by absorbing the tribes around them, either through war or marriage? The idea of manifest destiny existed long before the term came into use.  \n\nNeither side wished to compromise.  Magic, chaotic by nature but ensuring balance, refused to bow to the Humans.  Humans, who imposed order and had begun to reject the very existence of Magic in favor of more tangible, controllable explanations, began to refuse to bow to the Magic.  As was perhaps inevitable, wars began.\n\nIt started small at first.  A village elder declaring that their tribe should begin to control their own future.  A chieftain finding out that they could manage agriculture and live without the need of magic to bring fertility to the crops.  Bands of huntsmen deciding that their skills and knowledge alone would ensure a bountiful hunt.  One by one, these people and their tribes would turn from the Magic.  There were consequences.  And consequences to the consequences.\n\nThe Gods and Goddesses would impose harsher punishments for minor violations of Nature’s laws.  Witches would begin using their powers to curse instead of cure.  Predators who would once only thin the herd began attacking the healthy and transferring them to their ranks.  Those who could foretell death began casting their vision beyond those whose time had come, and speeding up the natural decay of those who had years, perhaps decades left to their destined life span.\n\nThe Humans, in turn, began to find ways to kill the Magic.  Whether it was fire, or silver, or unifying their beliefs, and the power of those beliefs, behind more sympathetic gods, the Humans began to fight back, insisting on securing order among the chaos.  Insisting on securing the Rule of Man.\n\nThis culminated in all out war.  Battles were fought in both the known and unknown worlds.  The results, despite the Human’s advancement in defenses and offenses of all sorts, were never in doubt.  Order has predictability, rules that it must abide by to exist.  Chaos does not.  Just as the Humans would discover one unbeatable assault tactic, the Magic would, by the nature of Chaos, change to counteract it.  One side was armed with silver-tipped arrows and sticks wrapped in hawthorne. The other could twist your bones, remove your sight, or scream your untimely death into existence.  It was, in short, a massacre at every battle.\n\nThe Earth sent a portion of It’s spirit to meet with the Magic.  It was concerned.  Humans, despite their insistence on rushing towards their own mortality in freedom through the constraints of Order, were a part of It’s design.  They were needed for the future to unfold as it needed to.  The Earth knew that, left unchecked, left to let the wars play out as they would, the Humans would be wiped from existence.  The Earth, in short, asked Magic to stop.\n\nThe final meeting was between the highest representatives of the Magic, Morrigan and Dagda, the highest representative of the Humans whose name was not important enough to record, and the Earthly spirit.  While the Magic saw no reason to relent, and the Humans refused steadfastly to give up their pursuits, the Earth said simply that It’s will would be obeyed.  Magic would change in the Human’s world.  They would be allowed to leave a few representatives.  While these representatives may be momentarily physically displaced, they could never truly be destroyed.  If something unseemly were to happen, their would just regenerate in one form or another after time.\n\nHumans, in exchange, would house the essences of the Magical beings that would be moving on from the world.  While they would not be aware of this, the power would reside inside of them, mostly untapped.  Magic, the Earth explained, couldn’t just be destroyed, but it could be changed thanks to it’s chaotic nature.  Not every human would have magic essence, and when that human died, it would simply flow into someone else.\n\nMorrigan and Dagda were livid.  This wasn’t a negotiation, this was the Earth nearly destroying their kind.  Calmly, the Earth explained that the Magic had no real choice.  It did, however, warn the humans that Magic could always return if it felt that the Humans were not keep balance on their own.  The Humans agreed, and Morrigan simply said to the Earth, “Someday, you will beg for our return. Pray to us then, that we all say yes.”\n\nAnd so, Morrigan and Dagda, having relented, walked onto the battlefield.  With a word spoken softly but heard by all, Morrigan brought the battle to a stop.  She swept her hand, and in an instant all of the forces were arrayed on the field.  The forces of Magic and Chaos on one side, the much larger forces of Humans and Order on the other.  Her icy glare surveyed these meaty things that her people would be forced to inhabit, but having realized that they had lost, she saw no alternative. Morrigan held her husband’s hand once last time, looked into his eyes and smiled.  With a blink, the Magic vanished into their new homes.\n\nTime moved on.  Centuries passed and history was made.  Humans made the world their own, and eventually the idea of Magic was written off as a delusion.  Something that certainly didn’t truly exist, stories meant for children.\n\nThe representatives of Magic remained, year after year, century after century, doing just enough to keep the memory alive, awaiting the day that the Earth would finally ask for their return.\n\nThis morning, people across the world woke up suddenly able to do magic.  Suddenly with opaque fingernails, or a newly intensified sense of smell. Suddenly with the ability to fly, and the desire to feed on people they once called friends.\n\nThis morning, the Earth has finally decided to restore the balance. It has prayed to the Morrigan.  She and her husband have returned, and with them come the hordes of Chaos, remembering who they are and what their purpose is..  Balance will be restored, no matter the cost.",

        "text": "[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/), I told you all a bit about my job and the custom side of the business, which involves my inhuman clients. Of course, these custom jobs aren’t always my favorite, but most of the time, I prefer them to working with the open hours clientele. These are some of the most rude and entitled people I’ve ever met. With the custom clients, there are usually clear boundaries in place, and as long as they are respected, they will respect mine as well. The humans, on the other hand, don’t give a shit about boundaries or respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I want to tell you about the first time I ever witnessed a breach in our open hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was my fourth month on the job, and I was starting to get pretty comfortable with custom fittings. I knew the basics of measuring, note taking, and how to recommend fabrics for different skin types (do NOT give tweed to a werewolf, *trust me*). I was working with my coworker, Patrick, and we were waiting on our eight o’clock appointment to arrive. Patrick was mindlessly scrolling on his phone, and I was mentally preparing myself for the next hour of anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe elevator was locked for human use, as always, but we heard the front doors open and a seemingly human voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello? Are you guys still open?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart dropped. I knew the client we had coming in tonight, and this voice was not his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh shit,” Patrick hissed, dropping his phone and rushing to the floor. I ran right behind him, and we found a human man browsing the racks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“There you are! Do you guys have any leather jackets?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve never seen Patrick so angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sir,” he started, trying to keep his composure, “we have been closed for well over an hour. How did you get up the elevator?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The elevator wasn’t working, so I took the stairs,” he said with an obnoxious smirk. “If you’re closed, why are your doors unlocked? Seems to me like you’re open, seeing as you’re both still here, so why don’t you just show me your leather jackets, ‘kay?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis response shocked me. Not necessarily the blatant rudeness, but the fact that he had taken the stairs. The staircase door was always locked, and was only accessible with the keys we carry on our necks at all times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sir, it is clearly stated on our door that we close at seven o’clock. I don’t know how you gained access to the staircase, but you need to leave. We will be more than happy to help you when we open tomorrow, but for your safety, you need to leave immediately.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“*Excuse me?* For my safety? Is that a threat? I need to speak to your manager *right now.* I can’t believe this. I have never been disrespected like this. I’ve heard only wonderful things about this shop, and given the prices of your pieces I would *assume* you would be eager to serve me!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, we heard the elevator door open. *Oh fuck*, I thought, and the look on Patrick’s face showed he felt the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sir, you need to follow me right now. You will have to wait in the back office-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m not going *anywhere* with you, how dare you-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, the man froze. And not froze like he saw something that frightened him, I mean froze like time stopped for him. There was still a stream of spit stuck mid air in front of his angry red face. I looked around him to see our appointment, Richard, standing behind him with his golden cane touching the man’s ankle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good evenin’, folks!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard is a very short man, standing only three feet tall. He has white beard that falls all the way to the top of his gold-studded cowboy boots. He has extremely long white hair that usually drags behind him like a cap. Tonight, his outfit of choice was a pair of dark wash denim with gold detailing, a black button up shirt with gold threading, and a flashy bolo tie decorated with real rubies. This was actually toned down compared to his usual attire. The first time I met him, he was wearing a three-piece suit made out of woven gold. He spoke with a thick southern drawl, and had that classic southern charm to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most off-putting thing about him are his eyes. They are golden yellow, and are accentuated even more by his love of gold clothing. His pupils are almost cat-like, long ovals that are almost human, but not quite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick smiled at Richard nervously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello sir, it’s great to see y-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Is this young man givin’ you troubles?” he said, tapping his cane against the man’s ankles. Each time he lifted it up, the man briefly unfroze, and I watched incredulously as the line of spit inched further from his mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No no, not at all! He just simply was confused with our hours, I was just explaining to him-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Your store hours are very clear on the door there, and judgin’ by the crimson shade he’s turnin’, I take it he ain’t welcome here.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Richard, you know everyone is welcome in our shop. If you could just let me explain to him that he needs to leave for your appoint-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Now, Patrick,” Richard started slowly, walking around the frozen man, careful to keep his cane on him, “I’m aware everyone is welcome here, and that’s somethin’ I love about your shop. However, I know *you* are aware that I believe men should be held responsible for their actions. And this young man here, the one I heard screamin’ and hollerin’ from three floors down, needs to be taught a little somethin’ about respect. This is the type of behavior I’d expect from a toddler, but a grown man? And in front of a lady nonetheless?” He motioned to me, and I already felt the guilt from whatever he was about to do in the name of my honor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Richard, please-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Patrick, I don’t wanna waste both of our time by arguin’ over this. Please take the little lady to the back office. I’d like to have a word with this gentleman before my appointment, if you don’t mind.” He had a sternness to his voice I had never heard before, and almost in a trance, Patrick turned and motioned for me to step in the back. I looked at Richard, who gave me a solemn nod, and decided I didn’t want to see what was about to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we walked away, I heard the man unfreeze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“-you speak to me that… wait, who are you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick closed the office door just as we heard the man screaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What the fuck are you?! Please stop, don’t do this, oh my god HELP ME!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI covered my ears, trying to block out the horrifying squelching sounds coming from the floor. I was tempted to look out, convinced whatever I was imagining in my mind had to be worse than what was actually happening, but decided the sound was traumatizing enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed Patrick was just staring at the wall. I walked up to him carefully and waved my hands in front of his face, but he didn’t even seem to notice. His eyes began to water, and I noticed he wasn’t blinking. I assumed Richard had done something to his mind to allow his vengeance on the customer, so I closed his eyes for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, Patrick opened his eyes and turned back to the door, opening it and motioning for me to exit. I carefully stepped out, and when we got to the curtain, he did the same thing, politely holding it open for me. I saw Richard standing alone, wiping off his cane with a bright red cloth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I apologize, young lady. Men nowadays don’t understand how to behave themselves. It grinds my gears hearing those with no respect treatin’ kind folks like y'all as less than them. I hope this doesn’t tarnish our relationship, and I hope you understand why I had to take matters into my own hands.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a moment to look him up and down, and noticed a splash of red in his beard. I felt myself grow queasy, and hoped he hadn’t noticed my staring, with no luck. He caught my eyes, and quickly wiped it with his red cloth. I forced a smile, and decided I did *not* want to seem rude for staring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Of course, Richard. I appreciate your efforts to protect us and our store.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe smiled at me, and I glanced at Patrick, who was still staring mindlessly. “If you’re ready, we can go ahead and begin your appointment! I believe in your notes you mentioned you’re looking for a new suit?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That’s correct, darling,” he said with a kind smile. He approached Patrick, looked him right in his eyes, and said, “Alright son, let’s begin!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick quickly blinked back to reality. He looked around the store in a slight panic, and after seeing the look on my face that said *don’t ask any questions, let’s just do this,* he smiled at Richard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Absolutely! We have some new fabrics in, and our warehouse sent over a sample of our latest gold threading!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was completely caught off guard by Patrick’s cheery façade, but after stealing a glance at him during the measuring, I knew he was just as scared as I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter Richard left, Patrick and I spent the next hour trying to figure out what was wrong with the staircase door. We checked the lock, and sure enough, it wasn’t working. The door closed perfectly fine, but the lock was blocked by something. We tried prying it out with the key, a screwdriver, and even some sewing scissors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t understand, what is stuck in there?” he asked himself, getting increasingly frustrated. He began banging on the door forcefully, and I was about to yell at him to stop, but a small ruby fell out of the lock. I picked it up, and the realization dawned on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Richard? Why would he do that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick turned away from me slowly, silently checked the lock, and it worked fine. He then went upstairs, and I followed him quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Patrick, why would he do that? He was so set on everyone being so respectful, yet he jams our lock?? Who the fuck does that??”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe turned to me abruptly and I had to back up to avoid running into him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Monsters. Monsters do this. He was hungry, and he must have seen this man trying to get into the store. He gave him a way in, and when the man made the decision to act indecent, he gave Richard the excuse he needed to feed. Everyone we deal with has rules, and if anyone breaks them, they pay the price. That’s the way it is. Get used to it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sounded angry, but I could see something in his eyes that gave me a chill. They looked… hollow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did he do to you, Patrick?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sighed before turning away to continue packing up for the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This isn’t the first time Richard has done that to me. When his mind is set, he will make sure nothing stops him from finishing what he started. The thing is… When he has you in his mind, you see everything he sees. I saw… what he did to that man.” He looked at me carefully. “Maybe I’ll tell you tomorrow. Just be careful with Richard. He seems to like you, but you never know.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he walked out, and left me alone with a million questions and a full store to clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I’ve worked here, I find myself even more scared on the bus ride home. Every person I encounter gives me anxiety. If I saw Richard on the street, I wouldn’t think he was some being that can freeze people or is capable of *swallowing a person whole*, I would just think he is a very short man who likes gold and likes to wear colored contacts. But, knowing what I know, I find it much harder to trust strangers on the street.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne positive thing I’ve taken from my time here, though, is *just be fucking polite*. It might literally save your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)",

        "text": "I wiped my nose on my sleeve, absently staring at the snot slug with indifference. Shivering, I shifted uncomfortably. \n\n\n“Can I get you anything, hon?” a nurse asked as she took my vitals. The rhythmic beeping of the monitors lulled me into a daze. I shrugged and heaved a sigh.\n\n\n“I’m cold,” was all I could manage.\n\n\n“Let me get you some heated blankets,” I looked at her wearily and nodded slowly. She smiled at me with an abundance of kindness. She appeared to be in her 50s and carried her weight in her hips. \n\n\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breath, holding it for as long as I could. I heard the beeps change rhythm, indicating my oxygen levels had altered. I released the breath and suddenly felt warmth on my lap; my eyes snapped open.\n\n\n“It’s alright, it’s just me with the blankets,” the nurse said, softly. She took the blood pressure cuff off my arm and turned off the monitors. “Let’s get you warmed up and get some fluids in you, huh?”\n\n\nAs the needle pierced my skin, I jumped involuntarily. I could feel that she’d missed the vein, but it was my fault for moving. She finally hit the target, and I glanced down on instinct. The sight of blood back flushing into the IV tube made me dizzy, and I began shaking all over.\n\n\n“Are you Phoebe White?” a stern voice asked. The nurse looked up, puzzled. I nodded. “I’ll need to ask you a couple of quest–”\n\n\n“My patient needs fluids and to get settled. Your questions can wait.” My nurse looked at the man by the door as if he’d blown the place up. He stared at her, clearly astonished to have been spoken to in such a manner.\n\n\n\"Ma'am, with all due–\"\n\n\n\"I didn’t stutter. Out. Now.”\n\n\n\"But–\"\n\n\n\"You've plenty of witnesses to speak with at the moment. Let's not traumatize this poor young lady anymore…Out.\"\n\n\n“Yes ma’am,” he said, backing out of the room and closing the door.\n\n\n“That’d be my nephew. He’s new to the detective force and can be a bit pushy. Sure he’s doing his job, but you need to relax right now. We’ll get you some fluids and something for the anxiety, and you can rest. There are plenty of others he can chat with,” \n\n\nI watched as she hooked up the IV bags, typed a few things into the computer, and then she tucked the blanket around me a bit more.\n\n\n“Wh–what’s your name?” I mumbled as the medication started seducing me into slumber.\n\n\n“Cathy, love. My name is Cathy. I’ll bring you some more blankets, but you try to get some sleep for now. You’re safe.” \n\nCathy patted my arm and headed out of the room. I felt like I was floating, so I just let myself drift.\n\n\n\nCelebrating Boxing Day instead of Christmas with two of my favorite regulars who have become family to me felt like a great idea at the time. We’d all been suffering sadness due to the losses we faced as the years went on. This past year was especially brutal for all of us, so we elected to Brit Out and go for drinks the day after.\n\n\nI’d been lost in my own world at the time–suffering the loss of a failed marriage, a broken and homophobic family, and falling deeper and deeper in debt. Despite having 3 jobs, ends still weren’t even coming close to meeting. I finally got a small room in a rooming house, which gave me something that I could call my own. I was really getting back on track with my physical and mental health and really digging deep to find “me”.  So why not take a day off and spend it drinking with my “Elders”. Gain some wisdom, play some Keno, \"eat  the pu-pu for two down the road\", as “Auntie” Bia implies. Her old school language and rhetoric kill me sometimes, but that's not the point. \n\n\nI settled up at a seat on the backside of the bar at the restaurant. I was relatively surprised as to how chilly it was. Sitting so far from the door, I didn’t expect to need to keep my jacket on, but there are worse things. \n\n\nBoxing Day with my Duo. Coor’s Lights were set in front of us and the Keno Cards out. Can we just talk about Keno for a second? It’s a full-time freekin’ job! So many cards, sheets of paper for notes, having the app on their phones…\n\n\nBefore long, I’d moved on to the Champagne of beers, Miller High Life. Liquid gold in a bottle, in my opinion. As I took a long pull, I happened to glance at the Keno TV and something struck me as odd; there was something on the screen. \n\n\nIs that…blood?  I nearly pondered aloud. Stop it, I responded to myself. The amount of horror that I read and watch will always lend its macabre to my day to day life. I shook my head and went to the bathroom. I hit my weed pen, held, and exhaled slowly as I broke the seal.\n\n\nUpon returning to my seat, Bia looked at me with a dead straight face with a piercing stare.\n\n\n“Phoebe. Come here and give me a hug.” I was puzzled by her sternness, glanced over at Renzo and he winked; I hugged her as commanded. “Would you look at that Keno screen?” I pulled back from the hug for a moment and once more did as I was told. It still looked mildly streaky with something that– “HAPPY BOXING DAY!” she yelled in my ear.\n\n\n“Wait! You–the five–” I stuttered. \n\n\n“All 5 on the bonus!” she exclaimed. I hugged her tighter. It was so nice to see her laughing. “It’s time for a smoke,” Bia said, climbing out of her seat. For 70, she was tall, fit, and in great health. She patted my hand and started towards the emergency exit door. It boasted a screaming:\n\n\nEmergency Exit Only. Alarm Will Sound.\n\n\n“Bia….I wouldn’t do th–” I squeezed my eyes shut as she pushed the crash bar.\n\n\nThe alarm blared.\n\n\n“It wasn’t like this before!” she exclaimed. “I always go out this door!”\n\n\nThree staff members appeared at the door within seconds to disarm the alarm and lock the doors. It was like they appeared out of nowhere. I chuckled and then went outside with her. I took a few hits off of my pen again, and I also hit my nicotine pen. My head swam from the rush as my body absorbed the drug. I passed her the same pen, to which she happily took and ripped.\n\n\nWhen we went back in, I was still floating from the cannabis and nicotine. I grinned over at Renzo, who was devouring his spare ribs with delight. Bia went back to checking her tickets from the games we missed and continued her notes. \n\n\nI happened to glance at the screen again and was still seeing something. This is all in your head, Phoebes, I tried to tell myself. \n\n\n“L-A-L-L, Phoebe.” Bia said, leaning into me.\n\n\n“I’m sorry?” I asked, distractedly. \n\n\n“Live And Let Live.” Before long, she was rambling on about her lineage, Renzo’s, and all about the zodiac. I nodded and was selfishly passive in the conversation due to distraction.\n\n\nI stood up again, pretending to stretch. I leaned on the bar and looked up at the tiles closest to the TV. The four tiles looked slightly newer than the dingy and worn ones that covered the rest of the ceiling. \n\n\nI looked closer at the suspended ceiling tracks, and those certainly had a story to tell. They were stained a dark copper color as opposed to the gold ones throughout the rest of the bar and restaurant. Something was certainly off, and something was definitely wrong.\n\n\nI walked over to Renzo’s seat and leaned closer to him, mentioning my concerns. He looked at me with mild confuzzlement, then at the screen.\n\n\n“Wait for it to change screens,” I said under my breath. As the screen changed from advertisement to the currently drawn numbers to other advertisements, he adjusted his glasses.\n\n\nWithout warning, Renzo stood up and walked over to the service station, which was adjacent to the tiles and television. He stepped behind the bar and kicked the trash out of the way to get a closer look. He called out for the bartender to get him a stool. At first, she tried to deny him, but arguing with a military vet who is on a mission proved to be useless. \n\n\nShe got him a stool, and he climbed up, first examining, then pushing one of the tiles. It didn’t budge. He tried pushing a bit more aggressively, and after no result, gave a hard shove as hard as he could. The stool gave out from beneath him and Renzo went crashing to the floor as a large transparent plastic bag and congealed blood collapsed onto him.\n\n\nBia screamed. The bartender at first reached for Renzo, who was crying for help, then fainted. I gripped Bia’s seat and began to tremble. The sip of beer that was in my mouth went sour as I threw up onto the plate of ribs. \n\n\nAmidst the screams, everything went silent, and then black.\n\n\n\nWhen I started coming out of the drug induced state some hours after Nurse Cathy had tended to me, I overheard the television that was on in my room. It didn’t make sense at first, but then it started to come together.\n\n\nThe breaking news that evening was the event that I’d experienced. A body had been found, hacked to pieces, bagged, and stuffed in the ceiling. There were no details yet, and a massive investigation was set to unfold. \n\n\nWhat they found was the butchered body of a tender aged child.",

The shop was dusty and dim, with books piled high on every surface. I spent hours browsing through the stacks, picking up old leather-bound volumes and flipping through the yellowed pages.\n\nOne book in particular caught my eye. It looked particularly old, with a tattered, dark leather cover, and strange symbols etched into the spine. I didn't know what it meant, but something about it called to me. I couldn't resist. I bought the book and took it home, eager to delve into its secrets.\n\nIt was only when I started reading the book that I began to realize the true nature of what I had stumbled upon. The book was a collection of movements, some of which looked too dangerous to even think about doing, as they seemed to require a bladed weapon. But one of the movements in particular caught my eye. It was a simple dance, one that anyone could perform. I didn't know what it did, but I couldn't resist. I began to perform the dance, following the steps outlined in the book.\n\nIt was only after I had finished the dance that I realized something was wrong. I realized during the last step I knocked over my glass, but hadn’t heard it fall yet. I looked back, and saw it, mid-air. I couldn’t believe it. Did the dance stop the glass from falling?\n\nI went outside. Because it was early in the morning, it was quiet, but more so than normal, it was eerie. It took me a while before I found any other people. But when I did, I saw they were frozen in place, like statues. \n\nTime had come to a halt.\n\nAs I walked through the frozen world, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. I saw people in the middle of a conversation, their mouths open mid-sentence. I saw children in the middle of playing, their toys scattered around them. I saw cars mid-collision, their drivers and passengers trapped inside, unable to stop the catastrophy that was about to occur to them.\n\nI spent years trying to undo the halt. I tried every ritual and incantation in the book, but nothing worked. I was trapped in a world where time had stopped, and I was the only one that knew. I was the only one that could see the world as it truly was.\n\nIt wasn't until years later, perhaps even decades, that I finally translated the ritual I had performed. It was meant to be used in times of war, as a defensive measure, a way to stop the enemy in their tracks. It was meant to be used only until the enemy was surrounded, for days at most, but I had used it without knowing what it truly meant.\n\nThe book explained that to undo the halt, you’d simply have to do the movements in the reverse order, and ending it by clapping your hands, I assume in victory of the battle this was supposed to win.\n\nI immediately went to stop the halt, but the damage had been done. I’ve aged. Enough for it to be noticeable to anyone that knows me. Enough that I can’t simply explain it away as stress. \n\nI was the only one that knew the truth. I was the only one that knew what had truly happened.",

        "text": "I made this as a comment to a post that reminded me of this. I thought, however it deserved it’s own post. I can also make a series out of this with stuff that’s happened to me and still is!… urgh…\n\nI need to add that before I post this. A little bit about me.\n\nMy Nick name is Kallyanna. I’ll use my maiden name in this post, or maybe series if I feel like sharing more about my personal life. \n\nHere’s the thing, I have 2 Hearts. \n\nOne is normal and the other is a size of a walnut that DOES beat, but off-rhythm.\n\nI’ve been laughed at and also called a “TimeLord”? By some, some of my closest friends nicknamed me “the doctor” cos I helped them out in medical emergencies growing up. They also referenced a tv show, I have lived though my mother binge watching Grays anatomy to know I have no interest in this show!\n\nI don’t really have any special abilities, well, unless you count the fact I can play any instrument put in front of me without learning it. Give me a few minutes, then request a song. I’ll play it….!!!! On whatever instrument you give me (minus the trombone) no clue why but I just can’t figure that shit out! *hats off to all you trombone players yo!* \n\nI also have this strange issue with dreams. I find myself getting into other peoples dreams and they come true… usually, but not always (thankfully)\n\nAnyways, on to the comment that I posted on something here and people were intrigued. Here it is. One of my weird things my friend asked me to do for them.\n\nI have a friend that has teens into paganism atm or ‘Wiccan’ mixed. She caught them in a conversation trying to summon a demon or something (proper blood ritual too). \n\nShe called me (I’m your average looking - some say quite pretty for my age of 36 - long ass it’s also below my ass black blue hair that has a natural plum streak in it and pearling dark ocean blue eyes that can go pearlescent purple if the light hits my irises correctly, my toddler also has the same eyes as me! #BlessedOrCursed? - I can’t get rid of that damn streak no matter how many times I dye my hair!)she asked me to come over whilst she could hear them doing the “ritual” I knocked on the door. She let me in asked me to have my hair down fully.\n\nSure ok, w/e but she also had a plan. Using my “inhuman” birth (twin absorption) to scare the girls. I am an anomaly that has 2 hearts. One normal and one next to it that is the size of a walnut.\n\nShe takes me up to her daughter’s room and she says (you know about these ritual thing and buggers off leaving me standing next to her daughters bedroom door) \n\nI roughly can translate Latin (thanks school!) and they neared the end of their “””ritual”””. I knocked on the bedroom door and they all started screaming….. I was kinda in my element at that hehehehehgehe \n\nOne of the girls threw the door open and my friends daughter (they were aged 13 - 15) freaked and my friends daughter said “oh Shit! KALLY!!! This is your kinda thing! Come in!”\n\nShe introduced me to her gaggle of friends as “mum’s witchy friend” (seriously *mega eye roll*) one of her friends asked if I speak Latin well (of course I fucking do child! It was mandatory in school back in the day! 😆) \n\nShe said she read the words to a summoning spell. I asked her what they were trying to summon. She looked at my friends daughter and then at her other friend. I was like “okayyyyyy, I can’t help if you don’t fucking tell me!”\n\nMy daughters other friend that the other one had glanced at said “A-a,a,a Siren” he stammered. \n\nOh so you thought that bringing one here would be of benefit to you guys?! \n\n“Yeah” he said. \n\n“Why?” I asked.\nBecause we thought it would be cool as fuck to finally meet a non-human thingy?”\n\nI sighed and said, “well your spell did work” \n\nMy friends daughter asked me “no one is here though?!!!!” \n\nNow I forgot to mention that her little brother who is 8 yea old is in the ‘let’s play doctor’ phase of his life (honesty their is hope for the kiddo, he’s quite knowledgeable!). I had his toy stethoscope. \n\nI might also want to mention, I used to teach singing back in the days when I lived in Canada as a side hustle before my work visa came in there. I said “a siren eh? Did you want it to sing to you or what?”\n\nHe was like, “kinda? I guess”,\n“What song did you want it to sing?” I asked, now amused.\n\n“Misty mountains cold from the hobbit!!!!!” A girl that was previously quite exclaimed (she looked about 15 years old or so with black makeup, probably the instigator for this entire charade….)\n\nNow little did they know, I can hit some pretty decent bass notes, 5 years of practice (and difficult as fuck for octave jumps)! \n\nWhat did I do? Started singing ‘Misty mountains’ in a man’s voice. The second verse I switched to my normal octave.\n\n“Wow Kally! You’re a good singer and that was UN-S-A-N-E” my friends daughter exclaimed.\n\n“Can you help us with the ritual maybe? I don’t think we did it right”, her gothic friend asked.\n\n“Oh you did”, I smiled. I had a sudden urge to visit my old friend I’ve not seen in about 6 years until tonight. Stopped in, knocked and, directing my gaze to my friends daughter, she asked me to help you guys.\n\n“Mums fucking weird!” She exclaimed, “Language!” I warned… \n\n“But then I need to tell you guys that your little ritual actually worked”.\n\nThey all looked at me in confusion (I could hear my friend giggling under her breath outside the door..) “for fucks sake Jen stop giggling” I thought to myself. “You’ll give us away!”\n\nI pulled her little brothers stethoscope out of my back pocket. “Listen” I added.\n\nThey all recoiled in shock at listening to my hearts beating out of rhythm. My walnut one has a distinctive tap to it along side my regular heart.\n\nThey all backed off and exclaimed “WHAT THE FUCK” (over and over) I said, “well your ritual worked and I’m here, I don’t like portal’s, too cramped and URGH…. I prefer the door”\n\nTurned around and walked out of my friends daughter’s room leaving them, I think a mixture of gobsmacked and terrified? Yeah, no clue what they were REALLY trying to achieve….\n\nBut me and my old friend had a nice ‘Irish coffee’ after that (FUCK LYING IT WAS BAILEYS! It’s awesome ik?!)\n\nShe thanked me and asked if I was up for trying blood magic again to help with some fucking issue she’s got with her ex. I said I’d provide a translation but that, was , all!",

        "text": "In the old days, those in my profession wore a mask. Some say that it's so no one comes for revenge. Others say that it was so God doesn't recognize it as a sin. Still, I have heard that it is so Death doesn't come for the wrong killer.\n\nLong gone are the days of axes, and it has been almost 50 years since even France used a guillotine. Instead, in my home state, we prefer the electric chair. And I am the hand that pulls the lever. A modern day executioner.\n\nWhat they don't often report on killing criminals, is the tow that is inflicted on those who sentenced them. The lawyers, the judge, the jury, and none more so than those who pull the lever. There's the guilt for some executioners. The toiling abyss, and uncertainty that plague some cases that aren't exactly cut and dry. And even the most die hard amongst us, never know when something will trigger our subconscious.\n\nMy colleague, Eddie Croquette, who pulled the big one over a mother who killed her two sons. She claimed they were demons. Because she only prayed for daughters. Had it happen to him. Pulling the lever on someone like that normally didn't keep any of us awake. But it was what the woman said while she was sitting there screaming as a hundred thousand jolts lit her nervous system up like a Christmas tree, that got him.\n\n\"It smells like cheeseburgers,\" he told me. \"Before her body went limp. And sure. You know. There's a little smoke. But I thought that was that. Until a couple days later. Jane and the kids come home with some McDonalds. And I was fine when I ate a fry. Even had a bit of their milkshake. But when I started unwrapping one of the cheeseburgers. I suddenly smelled it. Of that that woman cooking. It crawled out of some recess in my brain, and out of my nose. I could even taste it in my mouth.\" He shakes his head, \"I haven't been able to touch the stuff since.\"\n\nThen there were the conferences. It started as a kind of support group. And after Leslie McNeal passed away. It kind of grew from there. Those who knew Leslie, said she wasn't the same after bringing it down on this Satanist that had been convicted in the tri-state area.\n\nShe had chosen Eddie as her alternate, who later confirmed that it was true. That a Satanist did indeed cursed Leslie as he was dying. But it was after the fact, that caused the majority of the outrage from our community. When Leslie went to stop the juice, the electricity jumped and the amps became unstable.\n\nSee, there's a safety feature on the newer models. A light that warns the executioner if the leads are hot, meaning that the system's been overcharged and has caused the lever to be live. But most states still got them rinky dink ones built in the late 1800s, without any of the fail safes. Leslie's machine was one of those.\n\nAnd so we originally gathered to levy our grievances after her accident. To get those in charge to make a much needed change. But most of our push back came in the form of threats. That they'd tear the entire program down and switch to lethal injections. Put us all out of work. So we kept our mouths shut publicly, in want of a $3.29 cent part I see often at hardware stores.\n\nThe lack of that part sent Leslie to the hospital. Put her into a coma for 6 weeks. They had to amputate her arm because of it. From the elbow, down.\n\nAnd I've personally never met her. But I suppose what she said after waking up, is why people believe she was cursed.\n\nIt was Eddie and then committee leader Jo Jones who heard it from her own lips.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she screamed. \"Oh God. Jo. It's so scared!\"\n\n\"What is,\" Jo demanded. Eddie said the two were nearly shouting by this time because Leslie was howling and spitting, crying about the pain.\n\n\"My hand! My HAND,\" she shouted. \"It keeps signing, from my hand!\"\n\nH.\n\nE.\n\nL.\n\nL.\n\n\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWild theories after that one got out. A lot of at home accidents from fanatic groups, as electricity use in occults started to resurge.\n\nAnd I sometimes wondered about the mysticism of it myself. EVPs. Photographs. Energy. It's difficult not to have some sort of obsession with volts and amps, or Tesla coils while in this field. For instance, when electric cars were commercialized, I embraced them. Watches. Books on my tablet. It seems like such an odd thing to say for someone in such an archaic profession, but it is true.\n\nThat was until it happened to me.\n\nWhat became the most important case of my career, turned into one of pure terror. But I suppose I can't properly tell that story. Not really. Not without telling the last moments of Jennifer Tooley. As the this story and hers intertwine. Although, I don't know where the truth begins and the lies end.\n\nWhat I do know is that Jennifer Tooley was a budding journalist on this side of the Sierra Nevada. An all valley kind of girl. Beautiful, young, and full of potential. And on the night she was murdered. She was covering an event for work.\n\nHer text messages didn't indicate anything out of the ordinary. Gossip. Complaining about her dress. Her boss. How much she enjoyed the food. And what she hated. Later in the night, she even sent her brother a photo of the \"cute guy\" she had just met at the bar. A photo that would turn out to be the only clear image of her killer prior to his apprehension. And I mean this when I say. It's as if before that photo was taken of him. The man never even existed. He's in none of the public records. And as of this writing, no one has come forth to identify him or claim him as kin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer Tooley's body would be found 4 days later in a nearby cabin, after her brother reported her missing. She was found along with all of her belongings. Among them was a napkin where she had written: **Tonight I met a man. Though he claimed to be something more. But isn't that what they all say?**\n\nThere was also a video that was uncovered from her phone. Which was erroneously leaked to the public. Causing quite the stir.\n\nIn the video it showed Jennifer Tooley swimming for her life. She's screaming a sound my heart will never forget. Splashing. As she struggles to breathe after every stroke - far away from shore. And it's worth noting that Tooley was an excellent swimmer at the collegiate level. And had won multiple competitions. But that night, none of it seemed to matter. As shots pan to the shore where the man can be seen standing next to the cabin, back to her out deep in the water, back to the man who begins walking. On top of the water. Towards her. She turns again, screaming. Swimming. And looks back several times before the audio starts to hear the footsteps on the water getting closer. And closer. And closer. Until he's standing next to her. Crouches. And says, \"Do not be afraid.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe video cuts out and it's radio silence from the department. I feel as if it that made it worse. And what ultimately led to the rumors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started with a few frat boys, said they recognized the wanted man at one of their parties. They couldn't provide any proof, and after some digging it seemed they were trying to ruin the name of a rival football team. But even after the truth was revealed. It didn't matter. The damage had been done.\n\nNext thing I know, there's sightings of the man. At this ice cream parlor here. Or a restaurant there. Locals even began reporting someone screaming Jennifer Tooley's name past sunset. Headless goats. UFOS. The Swamp Ape. And even red candles found in the shape of a fallen star deep inside the woods were subsequently linked back to the killer.\n\nSo that by the time the man was finally captured, and came up for trial. Everything was up in the air. No one could get a good grasp of the situation. For every 5 people who called the man for what he was, a stone cold killer. There was a hardcore zeitgeists who would claim that this man, the murderer, was the new prophet. Some even claiming that the man was Jesus.\n\nThe evidence at the trial quelled most of that noise, as evidence that hadn't been leaked was finally released to the public. What he did to that poor girl. Holding her under the water. Dragging her back to shore. The way he chopped her up, hanging her on a hook in that old cabin, the look of life still in her eyes as he made her smile for the camera, was unholy.\n\nThe state didn't know what to do with him. They were afraid. And when someone suggested he be sent to the electric chair. I knew that my time was coming.\n\nAnd in October, that call came. I had been eating well, getting a lot of sleep. Really trying my best to stay in a good head space before the execution.\n\nAlthough the day of, didn't go as planned.\n\nUsually the officials and those invited, family of the victim and the convicted are brought into the room first. Then the officials, the Priest, and the executioner. So there's limited face to face between us and the condemned to lessen any psychological impacts. But this wasn't the case. Somehow the duties got mixed up and the Priest was running late. And I was left in the holding hall with the murderer. Alone.\n\n\"Do you know what my last meal was,\" he asked. \"Bread. And water.\" He chuckled, \"Of course when I drank it, was it still water?\"\n\nI tried to ignore him.\n\n\"Say, it was kind of like the day they caught me. I was drinking wine-\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" I rapped the wheelchair they had strapped him to.\n\n\"-but they said it wasn't wine.\"\n\nThe report said it was blood.\n\nHe laughed as if he could hear inside of my head.\n\n\"Go on. Ask it.\" He leaned in real close. I could see his teeth. \"Why did I leave all of that evidence behind?\" He laughed again as he answered his own question. \"So that they would know it was me.\"\n\nBy the time everything was sorted out. All the people and paper work. It was already an hour past noon. We were running late, and I was afraid the entire thing would be postponed. As if it were an act of God somehow.\n\nBut I knew that if I were called to service again, that I couldn't do it. I wouldn't be able to stand the man a second time. So when we were all mostly gathered, I pushed forward before anyone could get in a word.\n\nIn less than 15 minutes, we had him strapped up and the machine was primed. The phone was still on the hook and all last rites were said. The prisoner had opted out of any last words. And I was given the nod to send justice straight through his brain down to his sole.\n\nI pulled the lever.\n\nHis body contorted and snapped, shivering. His mouth opened, I could see inside it, a gasping hole that was blacker then night, as blue and white lightning came in flashes. And for once, I didn't let my hand off the lever, not until this monster's hair stood on end.\n\nWhen it was done a few people clapped. But it was Eddie I noticed first. He was looking at me, his eyes wide and telling, for he knew better than most what I had done, and exactly how I was feeling. How a killer only seemed to spread his madness from one person to the next, even in the end.\n\nBefore anyone could move.\n\nThe man opened his eyes and smiled.\n\nNo one knew what to do.\n\n\"What the fuck happened,\" the Chief yelled at me. \"Was it primed?\"\n\nI could barley nod.\n\nEddie agreed, \"I checked it myself.\"\n\n\"What should we do,\" someone asked.\n\nOne of the men in the plastic seats got up angrily. From the papers I knew him to be Jennifer Tooley's brother. He was full of anger. Rushing forward. As two officers detained him to the floor.\n\nThe man in the electric chair only laughed.\n\nThe red phone suddenly rang, and everyone grew quiet. Except for the man. The Chief answered the phone on the third ring. I could see him shaking his head, and then after a brief exchange he turned to me and said, \"Do it again.\"\n\nI pulled down the lever and this time I stepped back and watched.\n\nIt went on for a whole 5 minutes before I turned it off. Everyone was silent this time. We all watched the burnt body carefully. The Chief somehow goaded Eddie in approaching the chair.\n\nHe crept closer. I could see him smelling the air. See the shiver run down his spine as he approaches the man in the chair.\n\nIn an instant. Blood spurted everywhere. Eddie fell backwards howling, clutching his face, as the man, the murderer, was grinning from ear to ear with a piece of Eddie's skin in his mouth.\n\nI could hear a few people screaming. Some were hurriedly trying to leave. I stood there in shock as I didn't know what to do. And after nearly an hour of commotion, the coroner was forcibly coerced into writing down a time of death as no pulse could be found, although the body kept twitching.\n\nEventually, the guards removed the man without a name and strapped him back into the wheelchair. And as long as I live. I'll swear. That even as the door was swinging shut behind him, I could still hear that man laughing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

I went to the window to check what was goin on and.....nothing....it was normal....then suddenly 2 to 3 people came running down the road screaming....they were running abnormally....like they had been injured or something...it was dark so i couldn't take a good look at why they were running like that...i just brushed it off thinking that they were being chased by sum friend or something and having fun....so i ignored it and went back to sleep....i suddenly woke up again....3:45am the clock displayed...i woke up hearing a very gentle knock on my door....who the hell wants something at 3 45 in the morning i thought to myself...then i asked loudly..\"who the hell are you and what do you want at this time?\"......nothing....silence filled the room.....after about 5 minutes of me sitting on my bed and whatever the hell that person or thing was....didnt even move....then...i thought to go back to sleep....i was angry and scared at the same time....angry because that i woke up in my good sleep which i wasnt able to get for a while....scared because whatever that thing or whoever that was....didnt even responded or knocked a 2nd time....eventually i fell asleep.......4:30am....my phone vibrated...it was a call from my friend shawn...\nI picked up and asked him what happened....he sounded like he just ran a marathon... He told me \" have you checked the news on what is happening?\" No i said...i was sleeping in my bed....\"dude you gotta check the news man....this is exactly like a zombie apocalypse but....its different kind of people\"...\"what the heck are you even saying are you drunk?\" I asked him....\"no you idiot just check the news if you think im drunk....and in the meantime im driving over to your house right now!\"....he sounded like he wasnt jokin around which he usually did....so i turned on the tv...to my horror...he wasnt....the whole city was in panic.... apparently there were......lets say creatures if not people running around in the city murdering people with a knife....but...the terrifying thing is...they had no face....no eyes...no mouth...just a knife in their hands and murdering people in the open...the police reports said....they were immune to gunshots...these creatures were all over the city....the police didnt knew the exact count of how many were there.....i thought to myself \"that person who knocked must be one of em\"...then suddenly i heard my neighbour scream at the top of her lungs....with the sound of someone being stabbed continuously....thankfully i had a katana knife with me as i was a samurai trainee and pretty good with swords....i grabbed my sword....went to the door....i looked outside through the peephole....blood all over the walls....on the floor...then all the lights went out.....two shadow figures walked across my door as i saw through the peephole...they were walking abnormally......i was scared...i grabbed a flashlight and got the courage to open the door....i slowly opened the door..thankfully the door didnt make any creaking noise because of good maintenance...as i opened the door....i saw those two figures walking away far down the hallway....looking at every door...it looked like they were searching for humans....i looked at my neighbours house and saw something that shocked me to my core...i saw my neighbour laying on the ground...dead..stabbed multiple times..her intenstines were out of her body..her stomach was cut open...chunks of her flesh on the floor...i almost screamed but i controlled myself...then i slowly walked to the stairway which was not far for my room.....i almost reached the stairs when i looked at them again and saw the two figures charging towards me with full speed....i started running and trying not to cry and scream for help....i knew screaming for help wasnt gonna do any good because most of the people were killed by those creatures...as i reached the ground floor..i ran through the sidewalks..while running i saw one of them about 50 feet away from me....i thought i was done....i had no choice but to fight it with my sword....so i stopped....the creature ran towards me like a lunatic....i saw the figure clearly....no eyes....no mouth...it was as if they can sense humans..... they had a human figure.....they had a 7.5 inch knife in their hand...so it charged towards me....i made an attempt to slit its throat....and i did...but...it didnt make any difference......it still was swinging its knife at me like nothing even happened.....then i made an attempt to cut his hand....i missed a couple of times...but i made it happen....it finally fell to the ground when i did that.....but his hand didnt leave the knife even after being cut off from the body..as if te knife was sticked to its hand..after this i continued running looking for a safe place to hide until my friend came to pick me up....i found a warehouse just down the block....hid behind a couple of boxes....and took my phone out to call my friend...as i was dialing the number....i could hear many peoples scream being murdered by these creatures alongside with the sound of gunshots....but i knew that gunshots didnt make an affect on them....as i called and told him where i was....i heard footsteps beside my hiding spot....it sounded as if they were looking for me....i stayed silent in my spot praying that they would go away but...no...it was as if they knew where i was hiding and waiting for me to come out...after about 5 minutes....the sound of the footsteps disappeared...i then got out of my hiding spot....went to the door and tried to look outside....i saw multiple people lying on the floor....blood everywhere on the road...the walls....cars...everything.....as i was looking...i suddenly felt a sharp pain in my back.....it was them....they hadn't left after all....i tried to fight back....and i did...i knew their spot was their hand....so i aimed to cut their hands while fighting these creatures....i killed one of them...but the pain was so intense i didn't had the power to fight the second one....so i tried to run and i ran in the middle of the street....after running for like...5 seconds...i fell down on the road..and looked at the creature about to stab me to death and knew my life was gonna end right then and there...but...suddenly a car came at full speed and hit the creature....it was shawn.....he got out of the car with a sword....\"aim for the hand with the knife\".....he did exactly as i told him and killed it immediately....he was also a samurai trainee and we trained together..he also knew how to handle swords....he killed it and came to me as i was lying on the road....\"are you okay?\" He asked....and before i responded.....i saw 6 of the creatures running towards us with full speed from down the road.....i screamed \"get in the goddamn car! They're behind you!!\" He saw them and immediately carried me and put me in the passenger seat and got in the car and started driving....i passed out in the car because of the wound.",

        "text": "On November 23th, the world took from me the sweetest, funniest and kindest person to have ever lived.\n\nMy luck was extreme the moment I met her.\n\n\"What do you call an animal who couldn't get into college?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nI didn't know this girl but there she was. Trying to obviously make a bad joke as an attempt to break the ice between us. Never happened to me before so I was speechless. About the joke though… I was no expert so it might have been the most hilarious thing I've ever heard for all I knew or the cringiest thing in the world.\n\n\"A sloth.\" She started laughing at her own joke. \"Get it? 'Cause they're slow?\"\n\nJoke was bad but her laughter was contagious so I started giggling\n\nShe seemed a bit tipsy but not enough to just be going out around hitting on random people.\n\n\"Are you OK, miss?\" I asked out of concern. Who knew who she could've approached next if I didn't intervene. Bar was full of sketchy people after all.\n\n\"I have a car, I'll drive you home.\" I offered.\n\n\"That was quick, I'm not that easy you know?\" She replied while winking at me.\n\n\"Easy enough to get snatched up by that bunch.\" I pointed at a gang of bikers at the bottom of the bar\n\n\"The fuck?\" She snapped at me. \"They could just be enjoying a drink just like you and me… judgy male.\"\n\n\"Ummh.\"\n\n\"Haha, just kidding. Let's get the fuck out of here.\" She grabbed my hand and walked me out of there.\n\nOne year later I was holding her hand and putting a ring on it. It was a family heirloom. 6 people had worn it before her.\n\nWe lived 3 amazing years together. No kids. Not for the lack of try; of course. But that never put us down.\n\nUnfortunately tragedy struck. She fell from the roof of a building trying to safe a suicide jumper. Motherfucker survived. It was her childhood friend. A friend with no mental health history.\n\nNow how do you move on from the loss of a loved one?\n\nTwo inseparable souls.\n\nTwo people who used to do everything together.\n\nHow can you move on from that?\n\nI've come to the conclusion that you can't.\n\nYou just gotta learn, or at least try, to live with it.\n\nFor me, it's been getting easier day by day. She died two months ago.\n\nI don't know what's worst, to be honest.\n\nLiving without her happy, funny personality.\n\nOr this version of her breathing down my neck all night while I try to sleep telling me her awful dad jokes.\n\n\"You know, babe? I was wondering why the baseball ball was getting bigger and bigger… and then it hit me.\"\n\nThere's no \"funny\" on it. They're just empty words.\n\nShe was there. I ran to hug her. It was actually her… but cold. I started freezing. My fingers. Frostbite.\n\nWhen she disappeared I went to the emergency room. I was fine. No lost limbs.\n\nBut despite her being at home. Almost killing me with her presence. I never asked for help. It was the love of my life after all. How could I?\n\nThe freezing cold did take my toe. That's when I got scared. Did she not mean it? Or was I with…?\n\nAll I saw when I met her and in all the time we spent together was a girl who had the heaven's gates open for her. There was no way. No way.\n\nBut she was my baby. Maybe she didn't mean to hurt me and just came down because she missed me.\n\nShe was just a little blue.\n\n\"Can a kangaroo jump higher than a house? Of course, houses can't jump.\"\n\nI cry every time she tells me one of her jokes. Cry myself to sleep. But she's there to hug me. Every single time. And every single time I gotta call emergency services. They were surprised how a person almost freezes to death several times in 3 weeks.\n\n\"Close the damn windows due\"\n\nIt was summer.\n\nAs she got colder I got thinner.\n\nLike I mentioned before. I had my doubts. Is she really my girl? Or something else feeding off my grief.\n\nShall I seek advice?\n\nI'm pretty weak now. But her color is coming back.\n\nI wonder: should've my love died that day with her? Or should I die so she can live.\n\nLast night she told me two more of her jokes.\n\n\"I'm afraid of the calendar. Its days are numbered.\"\n\n\"What do you do when you propose to somebody?\"\n\nShe waited for my answer. But nothing came out of my mouth.\n\n\"You make sure it's a new ring… who knows? Old things might have… stuff.\"",

        "text": " As I lay in my bed, trying to fall asleep, I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching me. Every night, I would hear strange noises coming from outside, in my backyard. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just the wind or my imagination, but the noises persisted. \n\n I decided to investigate, so I sneaked out of my bedroom window and made my way to the backyard. As I reached my backyard, I saw something that I will never forget. I saw a figure standing in the shadows, watching me. I froze, my heart racing, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream. I quickly ran back inside and locked all the doors and windows, but I knew deep down inside that it wouldn't be enough to keep him out. \n\n From that night on, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. I started to notice strange things happening in my backyard, like footprints in the mud and objects moved around. I started to feel like I was being stalked, like someone was always watching me. \n\n I tried to tell my parents, but they didn't believe me. I was trapped, trapped in my own home with someone who was stalking me. I didn't know what to do, I was alone and I was scared. Every night I would lay in bed, eyes wide open, staring at the window, waiting for him to come back. But he never came back, I never saw him again, but I knew that he was still out there .\n\n As the nights went on, the feeling of being watched only intensified. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't focus on anything. I was always on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I started to notice more and more strange things happening in my backyard. Objects would disappear, only to reappear in different places. I even found strange symbols etched into the ground. \n\n I tried to tell my parents again, but they still didn't believe me. They thought I was just imagining things, that I was being paranoid. I knew that I had to take matters into my own hands. \n\n I set up a camera in my backyard, hoping to catch the stalker in the act. And one night, I finally got the evidence I needed. The camera caught a figure, shrouded in darkness, moving around in my backyard. I couldn't see his face, but I could tell that he was watching me. \n\n I showed the footage to my parents, and finally, they believed me. We contacted the police, and they launched an investigation. But despite their best efforts, they were never able to find the stalker. \n\n To this day, I still don't know who was watching me, or why. But I do know that I'll never be able to forget the feeling of being watched, and the terror of not knowing who or what was behind it. \n\n I started to do some research on my own, trying to find any clues that might lead me to the identity of the stalker. I dug deeper into the symbols that were etched into the ground and found out that they were ancient symbols of protection. But I couldn't understand why they were there, who put them there and what they were supposed to protect me from. \n\n I was constantly on guard, never alone. I always had someone with me, even when I went to the grocery store. I was too scared to be alone, too scared that the stalker would come for me. \n\n One night, as I lay in bed, I heard a noise coming from outside. I immediately thought it was the stalker, but this time, I was ready for him. I grabbed a baseball bat and slowly made my way to the backyard. And there he was, the stalker, standing there in the shadows, watching me. But as I reached the backyard, there was no one there.  \n\n One day, I heard the news that someone had died a few blocks from my house. The details were sketchy, but it was enough to send shivers down my spine. Was it the stalker? I couldn't be sure.\n\n Years have passed since that night, I never heard or saw the stalker again, but the fear and the unknown still lingers. Even though I have moved on with my life, the memory of that night still haunts me.",

        "text": "He always stole from me. He always stole every idea and concept I tried to conceive and make it his own.  He always ratted me out any opportunity he had. Rat was a great word for what he was. He was always trying to mate with shady rats from the back allies of the cities, always trying to seal a deal with the  ones who pillage. He always differed from anybody else with a moral compass. He always did what he was told by the pillagers, once he even stole thousands from a widow suffering from the loss of her lover due to cancer. He always ignored the basics of being a decent human. He always copied and stole just like the pillagers he interacted with, rats tend to stick together. He always wore a big top hat on his head when he went out for deals and pathetic mating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never did anything to benefit society yet he is at my door, asking for shelter for his pillagers have forsaken him, who could have known? He never sounded truthful in his apologies, in his remarks for redemption. He never could have seen the walls of his chosen lifestyle close in on him. He never took the nos I had repeatedly yelled at his face when he asked for permission into my domain.  He never cared that I attempted to blockade him from entering. He never left when I threatened to call the \" enforcers \" of the law of him squatting on my couch, he knew I had never had the conscious to do anything about him really. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe will stay for how long he requests in his own shattered mind. He will leave when the storm of his pillagers turning back on him becomes just another annoyance. He will steal the thoughts of mine, turn them around on him and get some of the points that he so desperately needs from our relatives.  He will be seen as the creative brother of us, even though the only creativity he has is the way of breaking into homes and getting a new kick or two. But. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe will not continue for far longer. For he is a tick that needs to be removed. For I will remove him from the public safety. For I will simply press 3 buttons and free humanity from the burden of the rat with the hat. And I did. And his mindless body was escorted to a prison where he remained for a good few months. In that time I was free. We were free. We were all free of this leech. But all good things have to come to an end. As he was released for the only crimes they could sniff out were trespassing and pick pocketing. And rats are very good at hiding their misdeeds, making this his first charge ever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery second he was in society after that I feared. For he had one of his pillagers speak to me personally. I was walking down the same street I go every day as a mourning jog, when the weasel came up to me and said to never interfere with his owner ever again. But the prospect of him, the rat in the hat, getting an actual punishment for his new crimes. His new crimes of stealing not just objects of value, but lives. Lives that are also in exchange for cold hard cash.  For once I found him, found him lacking around where he usually gets his golden cats. Where he enjoys the fine pleasures of mating without the actual cost of it. Was I the rat now? For I have forsaken whatever law and order I have displayed by alarming the enforcers of his crimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no. I am not a rat. I don't wear a hat. I don't pillage. I don't mate with shadows. I don't hide my misdeeds, as few as they seem in comparison to his.  Even though I am just a cog in the machine we call society, I am not a net negative. The enjoyment I felt when I saw that he was carried away by the enforcers was immeasurable yet extremely high.  At last I saw the rat in the hat get punishment that fit the deal. His life would be just bars, brick, and anal torture. But something about the rat in the hat wasn't dealt with. His weasels and pillagers were still running amuck. And they were ticked off about my presence of ratting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir anger followed me around, for times I swear I could see somebody staring at me while I was doing a daily task. And it cornered me. For I was trapped in my own home by a couple weasels.  My living room was just a room for tuning down my energy for my existence before this. Now it was a chamber of death. As the front door rattled and broke down to the weasels. The weasels entered my state of residence and turned to my now horror struck face. For they were out for unneeded revenge. Glued to the couch, I stared at their weapons, sticks that expelled anti-life lead balls. Pointed straight at me. All this for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't do anything but hold my hands up and plea. As soon as they arrived they left. But not without my body riddled with lead. For that was the last thing I could recall before waking up in the white void. There was nothing but my soul there. Nothing but the hazy shadows of the present. I could do nothing but walk. I guess souls aren't conditioned for anything but moving at an appointed angle.  Time didn't function in my head even with the shadows, all I know is that I was here for a long time. Long enough for my mind to fry itself from sheer dismay of being in such a location that defies its needs.  I was almost happy when I saw him in the corner of my vision, if you could even call it vision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rat in the hat spoke to me when I tried to scream my anger out all at once. But here sound was a work of fiction. For he spoke to me from my own mind. He asked me a deal, no pleaded. He asked  us for a deal in which we would both exist in reality again, but that we would both be swapped in positions again. In a desperate thought, I had said yes, even though everything else said everything opposing. That was enough for the rat in the hat to smile and fade away, with every shred of fear rising inside of my remaining soul and mind. I don't remember the change from a void to a stain riddled bed but it changed. Now, everything is different. I was myself to the pillagers, making them resent me, I was changed to my relatives, making them resent me, I was changed to friends and my work making them resent me. I have nothing to do but spew out my words on this paper. In the end, the rats always win",

        "text": " I had always been drawn to old and unique objects. So when my grandmother passed away and left me her antique mirror, I was thrilled. It was a beautiful piece, with an ornate golden frame and a large, rectangular glass. I couldn't wait to hang it in my bedroom and admire it every day.\n\nBut it wasn't long before I started to notice something strange. Every morning, when I walked into my room, I would see that the mirror had been moved slightly. At first, I thought I was just imagining things, or maybe I had moved it myself and forgotten. But as the days went on, the mirror began to move more and more, until it was clear that something was happening.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched through the mirror. It was as if someone, or something, was peering out at me from the other side. I would catch glimpses of shadows and shapes in the glass, but when I looked closer, they would disappear.\n\nI tried to ignore it at first, thinking it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But the mirror continued to move, and the shadows grew more frequent. I began to have nightmares about a dark figure standing behind me, watching me in my sleep.\n\nI decided to do some research on the mirror, hoping to find some answers. But all I could find was that it was an old piece, possibly from the 19th century, and it had been passed down through my grandmother's family for generations. There was no mention of any strange occurrences or paranormal activity.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. I decided to get rid of the mirror. I wrapped it in a blanket and put it in the trunk of my car, planning to drop it off at a thrift store the next day. But that night, as I lay in bed, I heard a loud crash from the living room. I got up to investigate and found that the mirror had somehow fallen out of the trunk and shattered on the floor.\n\nI was relieved that the mirror was gone, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't over. And I was right. The next morning, I woke up to find the mirror had been reassembled and was back in my room, hanging on the wall. It was as if it had never been broken.\n\nI was terrified. I knew that this was no longer just a strange coincidence. I knew that the mirror was possessed by something evil, something that wanted to keep me under its gaze. I couldn't take it anymore. I moved out of that house and never looked back.\n\nYears have passed, but I still remember the mirror. I still have nightmares about it and I can't shake the feeling that it's still out there, waiting for me to return. I'm not sure if it's still in that house, or if it's following me, but I know one thing for sure: I'm still being watched. Through my mirror.",

        "text": "I was always fascinated by the occult and the unknown. So, when I stumbled upon an old, hidden-away antique book shop, I couldn't resist going in. The shop was dusty and dim, with books piled high on every surface. I spent hours browsing through the stacks, picking up old leather-bound volumes and flipping through the yellowed pages.\n\nOne book in particular caught my eye. It looked particularly old, with a tattered, dark leather cover, and strange symbols etched into the spine. I didn't know what it meant, but something about it called to me. I couldn't resist. I bought the book and took it home, eager to delve into its secrets.\n\nIt was only when I started reading the book that I began to realize the true nature of what I had stumbled upon. The book was a collection of movements, some of which looked too dangerous to even think about doing, as they seemed to require a knife. But one of the movements in particular caught my eye. It was a simple dance, one that anyone could perform. I didn't know what it meant, but I couldn't resist. I began to perform the dance, following the steps outlined in the book.\n\nIt was only after I had finished the dance that I realized something was wrong. I realized during the last step I knocked over my glass, but hadn’t heard it fall yet. I looked back, and saw it, mid-air. I couldn’t believe it. Did the dance stop the glass from falling?\n\nI went outside. Because it was early in the morning, it was quiet, but more so than normal, it was eerie. It took me a while before I found any other people. But when I did, I saw they were frozen in place, like statues. As I walked through the frozen world, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. I saw people in the middle of a conversation, their mouths open mid-sentence. I saw children in the middle of playing, their toys scattered around them. I saw cars mid-collision, their drivers and passengers trapped inside, unable to stop the catastrophy that was about to occur to them..\n\nBut it wasn't just the frozen people that made me uneasy. It was the spots that were appearing on their skin. At first, I thought the blemishes were some kind of disease, but as time went on, and the blemishes turned into exposed flesh, I realized that it was something else entirely. It was bacteria, eating away at the frozen people. They were being devoured, right before my eyes.\nI tried to ignore it at first, but the longer I was in the halt, the more I saw. I saw people's skin being eaten away, their organs consumed. I saw bones being exposed, and I knew that there was nothing I could do to stop it. I was the only one that was still moving, and I was powerless to save the people around me.\n\nI spent a long time trying to undo the halt. I tried every ritual in the book, but nothing worked. I was trapped in a world where time had stopped, and I was the only one that knew. I was the only one that could see the world as it truly was.\n\nIt wasn't until years later, perhaps even decades, that I finally translated the ritual I had performed. It was meant to be used in times of war, as a defensive measure, a way to stop the enemy in their tracks. It was meant to be used only until the enemy was surrounded, for days at most, but I had used it without knowing what it truly meant.\n\nThe book explained that to undo the halt, I’d simply have to do the movements in the reverse order, and ending it by clapping my hands, I assume in victory of the battle this was supposed to win, or to make the enemy instantly aware of my presence.\n\nI immediately went to stop the halt, but the damage had been done. The world would never be the same again. The events that occurred, you now know as the Break, one of the greatest tragedies in human history, and it was all my fault.\n\nUntil now, I was the only one that knew the truth. I was the only one that knew what had truly happened. And I would have to live with that knowledge for the rest of my life.\n\nThis post has been scheduled so please don't bother trying to stop me. I hope god knows I didn't mean for any of this to happen.\n\nI'm so sorry.",

        "text": "Like a totally normal person I love true crime and horror stories. So every night I turn on a horror or true crime story video, tonight “best of December 2022 nosleep compilation” at around 9 pm. I woke up to my young son (about 6 or 7) in front of the television, and when I asked what he as doing all he would say through tears was “mommy tell them they scared me” “they scared me” so I told him to get into my bed and that I would deal with it once he went to sleep, so here I am. \n\nIf you have kids maybe don’t be like me or you’ll have a scared child to deal with. He will probably be sleeping in the bed with me for awhile now. \n\nEDIT: First if all I would like to say I am sorry to the moderators and people theorizing about if this means something or not in the threads. Let me explain what happened and why I posted what I did. \n\nI’m usually good at determining what is and isn’t a dream. Many times through my life I have had dreams recounting traumatic experiences in my childhood. Because of this I’ve worked with therapists and I can often tell when something is a dream, when the circumstances get so bizarre it’s like I am able to tell it isn’t real. \n\nThat being said, when I woke up this morning the first thing I did was check my phone and was surprised to see notification after notification from Reddit. I opened the app to see that I was being bombard about sub rules and not making irrelevant posts in the sub, all underneath this post. \n\nLo and behold I made a post in my sleep. Makes sense because I had a dream about it last night, about my son blaming you guys for scaring him. Somewhere along the line I had gotten the impression he wanted me to post on Reddit, and having realized it was a dream chose to go along. I had realized it was a dream because I have never had a child, I’m a 23 year old woman living alone. I do actually fall asleep to these videos, so I assume that’s how Reddit got involved. Sorry bout that folks but considering the creepy nature of the dream I feel as if it may qualify to stay up! Let me know!\n\nEDIT 2: I got up to make my bed, but when my feet hit the ground I heard I a small voice coming from underneath the bed “Mommy! You didn’t deal with them, I went out there and they scared me again.” and quickly retracted my feet back into the bed. I don’t know how I would begin to describe this to a 911 dispatcher, let alone without the boy hearing. Whatever happens happens, maybe I’m over reacting but maybe I’m not. I took a moment to pray before deciding to make this update so my family knows that I will leave my final remarks (just in case) in drafts on this account- the password is my first dog and birthday.  May the lord help my soul.",

After months of little clues here and there, they had suspected that the Smith’s had a child hidden away in their home.  To anyone’s knowledge, the Smith’s did not have any children.\n\nIt didn’t take very long at all to discover that Mrs. Kayleen Smith did indeed give birth to twin boys over fifteen years ago in New Jersey, and in the years since, the Smith’s had lived in different residences all over the country, never staying in one place for longer than eight months at a time.\n\nI had been called in along with two deputies, in order to check on the welfare of the children. Children that no one had seen. There were no school records, vaccination records, or doctors records of any kind. \n\nThere were only two names on two birth certificates. James Smith and Kyle Smith. There was also a death certificate for Kyle Smith less than two months after his birth.\n\nMrs. Smith let us in the home without any resistance and told us that her sons had passed away shortly after they were born. She was more than compliant as the deputies searched her home; although she did call her husband, who came to the premises within ten minutes of her call.\n\nI will admit that the exchanges with Mrs. Smith became more and more awkward as the minutes went by, and as the deputies went into the basement, she seemed to be shaking. Mr. Smith arrived on premises directly after the deputies went into the basement. He leapt out of the vehicle holding a handgun. \n\nAlmost immediately after going into the basement, Deputy Morrow ran back up the stairs, and that is when Mr. Smith entered the home and began shooting. After a brief exchange of gunfire, Deputy Morrow had shot Mr. Smith, who died at the scene. \n\nMrs. Morrow had been shot in the stomach.  Deputy Morrow then called for backup and began to attend to Mrs. Smith, who was begging us not to take her son.\n\nI ran down to the basement and discovered that the Smith’s had indeed been holding one of their sons in deplorable conditions. He was chained to the floor from four sides. The chains were attached to a collar around his neck. There were multiple scars all over every inch of his body, along with two seemingly fresh lacerations to his torso. \n\nA black cloth sack was over his head, and after it was taken off, we discovered that his eyes were absent. It appeared as if this was an abnormality at birth rather than any intervention or mutilation. There was also a handmade contraption of leather and metal strapped around his head which covered the lower half of his face from underneath the nose to around the bottom of the jaw.\n\nAir fresheners were hung from the rafters and two oscillating fans were sweeping the room. The entire floor was covered in scented kitty litter that was more than two inches deep in some places. There was evidence that the boy had been urinating and defecating onto the floor; several five gallon buckets were filled with excrement coated in litter. The rusty shovel that was used to clean the floor was standing next to the buckets. There was evidence that the Smith’s had been feeding their son nothing but dry dog food and a large trough of brown water was all that the boy had to drink.\n\nAs the boy was removed from the premises, Mrs. Smith, still lying on the floor, was still begging us not to take him from her. After a lengthy search of the home, the other son was not located. Mrs. Smith was questioned as to the whereabouts of her other son, and at this line of questioning, she broke down into hysterical sobs and laughter. She made one statement as she was rushed to the hospital. “Don’t let him out.” \n\nI rode in the ambulance with the boy on the way to the hospital. The contraption was removed from the lower half of his face. He was facing in my direction and he was smiling as if he could see me. There were no teeth present, and I took note of the fact that his jaw flopped open at an odd angle when the contraption was removed. The paramedic also took notice of this and said that the boy’s jaw appeared to have been broken in several places and never reset.\n\n His mouth was agape by almost two or three times more than normal by my estimation and pronounced stretch marks were noted streaking from the corners of his mouth and running towards the back of his neck. The inability to move his jaw interfered with any communication, however I believe it went deeper than that.\n\nHis vocalizations were horrifying to say the least. Obviously his parents had not spoken around him whatsoever, as my attempts at communication were met with not speech, but noises. What I was hearing was a guttural collection of sounds that had been put together with influences from ambient noises, such as clicks, sharp inhales, and hisses. \n\nThe sounds appeared to affect not only myself, but the paramedic as well. I can only describe it as a sort of misophonia, as if the sounds themselves were creating feelings of confusion and rage in my head. \n\nThe boy’s breathing was very shallow and ragged, and the paramedic had placed a breathing mask over his mouth, having to support the jaw in order to do so. After that, the feelings of confusion and rage were suddenly gone as soon as they had come. \n\nAfter a moment, the boy’s abdomen began to twitch. His hands were gripping the side of the stretcher and that brought my attention to the fact that there were no fingernails present. \n\nThe paramedic began to treat the boy's wounds on his stomach and something internally reacted under the touch of the paramedic. The boy’s abdomen began to twitch violently at first, and then ceased as abruptly as it began. The paramedic had no answer for what we were seeing. \n\nThe ambulance then pulled into the hospital. The boy was wheeled into the emergency room, and I began to write up my report while I waited for the police and an officer from foster care to arrive. Two officers were already there, as Mrs. Smith had already been admitted prior to our arrival. \n\nThe ER was quite busy already. With nowhere to sit, I had been standing at the corner of the Nurses Station typing up a brief summary of everything that had taken place. I had decided to put in my earphones and listen to music, so as not to be distracted while I wrote my initial report. \n\nAt approximately 3:47 p.m., little more than fifteen minutes after I had arrived at the emergency room, two more police officers ran into the ER. They spoke to the two officers who were already there. They then began to evacuate the room, while the other two officers ran further down the hall toward the boys room.\n\nI identified myself to the officers and began to explain why I needed to remain on premises. I was told by one Officer Dalton  that a video was found back at the house and that’s why we were being evacuated. The cryptic explanation was all I received before the last incident occurred.\n\nIt was at that point that I heard gunfire and screaming from down the hall. Everyone waiting in the lobby ran out the doors. The officers in the lobby ran to the sounds and I looked toward the computer screens behind the Nurses Station.\n\nI had a clear view on the monitors of the hallways beyond the waiting room. There was a wounded officer crawling out of an open room and he was bleeding excessively. The officers rounded the corner of the hall on the monitors and could see the officer who was down. \n\nThe wounded officer was then pulled backward into the room by someone. I could hear him scream as the other officers slowed their approach towards the open room with their guns drawn.\n\nI will say that the next portion of this does not make sense. I am aware of how my statements will be perceived. No one has done me the courtesy of confirming any of this. It is evident to me that some form of surveillance footage had to have been taken of the incident, as that is how I was able to see it in the first place. However, I understand that this is an ongoing investigation and my understanding of the events is not of priority.\n\nPerhaps I was in shock, but this is what I saw on the nurses monitors.\n\nAs the two officers approached the room, a doctor ran from the open room into the opposite wall of the hallway at full speed, knocking herself unconscious. The doctor came to rest on the floor of the hallway and did not move. Then I heard the vocal clicking and hissing from the boy echoing down the hallway.\n\n Again, I felt the feelings of rage I had experienced in the ambulance, but I immediately noticed that they were far more pronounced than they had been earlier. I fumbled for my headphones and jammed them deep into my ears and then turned the volume up. The rage left as soon as I could no longer hear the boy and I was once again come over with fear, but an unwillingness to leave.\n\nIt was then that I saw the boy emerge from the room. He was now wearing a hospital gown that was smeared with bloody handprints. The top of his head was doubled over onto itself; that’s the only way I can describe it. His upper and lower jaw were parallel to the ceiling, and the back of his head was touching the back of his neck. \n\nHe raised his hands at the officers, and they lowered their guns and dropped to their knees. Several other doctors and hospital staff ran into the hallway from other operating rooms, and in a similar fashion upon seeing or hearing the boy, they all dropped to their knees as well. The boy walked down the hallway until he came to one of the other rooms. \n\nHe pointed inside the room, and I watched as Officer Dalton got off of his knees and walked  into the open door that the boy was pointing at. Officer Dalton came back out of the room holding Mrs. Smith who was crying out and holding her stomach. She was thrown at the feet of the boy.\n\nShe was saying something, but I did not for a moment think of taking out my earphones in order to hear what was being said. The boy’s body turned and faced his mother. His back was to me on the video monitor, but the top half of his upside down face was pointed back toward the camera. It was at this point that something struggled up from inside of the boy's neck. His body was spasming, and I took note that his mass seemed to shift. His shoulders dropped and his hands fell to his sides.\n\nThere appeared to be some sort of growth or appendage emerging from the gaping jawline. It was difficult to see from behind. But there did appear to be what looked like a small arm and hand that was attached to the side of the growth. The boy knelt down beside his mother. The pronounced growth was close to her face. The small arm on the growth reached toward Mrs. Smith, and the hand on the end of it ran down the face of Mrs. Smith.\n\nIt was at this point that Officer Dalton turned his gun towards everyone else that was kneeling in the hallway. One by one, Officer Dalton executed every person in that hallway with the exception of the boy and Mrs. Smith. He even stopped to reload. No one in the hallway put up any resistance or even moved. They merely stared slack jawed at the boy until they were shot. \n\nAfter Officer Dalton had killed everyone he turned the gun on himself. Mrs. Smith was still crying and shaking her head. She was doing something with her arms, but the back of the boy blocked my view from whatever it was. I should have run, but I was unable to even think of it at that point. I was fixed onto that monitor. \n\nAfter almost a minute longer, I could see that Mrs. Smith began to convulse and she was spitting up blood until eventually she fell to the floor. The boy stood back up, and through the backs of his legs, I could see the body of Mrs. Smith.\n\nIt appeared that the wound in her stomach had been torn until it was a large hole. Several of her organs were laying on the floor around her body and I could see that her hands were covered in viscera and flesh. It appeared to me that Mrs. Smith had done this to herself, as there were no signs on the boy’s hands of any such activity.\n\nThe small arm folded itself against the appendage as the boy turned and began to shuffle towards the waiting room. The growth, or appendage, began to lower itself back down into the boy’s throat until it was no longer visible. Just before it was gone from view, the boy had come close enough to the camera that I could almost see it clearly. It appeared to be a parasite of some type with a deformed face of a small boy.  As I’ve not been allowed to see the footage, I can’t say with certainty what it was that I saw.\n\nI was in shock, I couldn't find the strength in my legs to run, but I did manage to slide down the wall, and was partially obscured by the nurses station. The boy walked past me, but stopped just short of the door. The boy reached upward with his left hand and gripped the hair on his head and positioned the upper half of his head back over the lower half. I kept my hand over my mouth. The urge to scream was almost unbearable as I watched something moving underneath his skin in the back of the open robe. It looked as if something was settling.\n\nThe boy turned towards me. I was staring back at his empty eye sockets. I have never felt fear like that in my life. A small hand protruded from between the toothless gums and pushed upwards. I saw the top of the head moving upwards again like a lid coming off of a bottle, and I saw the top of the parasite beginning to reemerge.\n\nI lost consciousness after that, and woke up later in a hospital bed. I have made statement after statement and I’ve been put on leave. I don’t know where I go from here or how I can keep living the way I always have after seeing what I’ve seen. I feel that my mind has been irreversibly damaged.",

        "text": "This happened in mid 2022, I can’t really remember.\n\nMy phone got water damaged and the LCD screen suddenly started acting strange and the colors completely went off and the screen went black. I knew the screen was on because there was still some light emitting from it but other than that, it was like a complete black hole.\n\nI’m still a student so I didn’t have a job or money to afford to get it repaired. So I asked my mom if she could help me.\n\nShe didn’t like the idea as I broke another phone last year and she was tired of my bullshit. So she straight up said get a job and fix it yourself. \n\nBut the screen didn’t have any cracks or scratches on it, almost like the screen went black without any reason. So I had an idea.\n\nI thought maybe if I convince the dealers that I got the phone from that the screen went blank without any reason, they’d exchange it for a new one ‘cause of the warranty.\n\nThere aren’t many apple stores in my region and most people rely on third party repair shops to get their phones fixed.\n\nBut these repair shops have a bad reputation of accessing customers’ phone data by plugging them with data cables and selling the data they gather for profit, or to hold peoples’ dignity and self respect for ransom.\n\nBut I took the risk anyway since I didn’t have anything to hide in my phone.\n\nI called the shop and explained the story exactly as I planned, but immediately they just knew something was off and didn’t buy it, they wanted to physically check the phone for an inspection before coming to any conclusion.\n\nSo I went there and handed the phone over to them, and the next day, they said that after they’ve checked, they spotted small droplets of water inside the iPhone circuit and that they’ve officially concluded that it’s water damaged by me and they have nothing to do with it.\n\nI tried convincing them again and again but it was no use, and told me it would cost a 105$ for a screen replacement.\n\nI didn’t have that kind of money so I asked them to lower the price down a bit and they agreed on 82.\n\nIt was still a significant amount to me but since they refused to lower the price further, I told them to just keep hold of the phone until I save up some bucks and they agreed.\n\nAnd now this is where things get a bit unexplainable.\n\nMonths passed by and I get a call from the shop saying the screen was “restored” all of a sudden.\n\nI was like WTF!? HOW!? I was so happy and excited over the news but at the same time, was completely at a loss as to how is that even possible.\n\nI told them I’ll swing by the shop in the evening and sure enough, the screen was working fine and the colors were back! I was visibly smiling at the scene!\n\nBut when I tried to type in the passcode, it was locked, not just for 2-3 minutes, but for an ENTIRE HOUR.\n\nI told them about the passcode lock and they said they know nothing about and just shrugged it off and went to answer their other customers who were there.\n\nAnd then I realized what they might’ve tried to do over the past months while my phone was there.\n\n1 hour means there were about 10 failed attempts, and God knows how much they attempts they’ve tried.\n\nThere are stories of unlucky people who’ve gotten their explicit images and videos leaked by these third party repair shop companies and taking no responsibility for their malicious intents and completely ruining their customers’ self image.\n\nI waited in the shop until the locked time expired and checked if anything’s changed or missing. Luckily, everything was A okay.\n\nI feared they might’ve guessed the combination now that they’ve seen me put in the code by the CCTV so I changed my passcode since.\n\nJust goes to show how just 6 digits can protect someone’s whole self image.\n\nBut the screen suddenly turning back to normal is still a mystery…",

        "text": "If you asked me what my dream job was when I was little, I would have said working at a movie studio.\n\nI was eighteen when I changed my mind I lived with my mom but not my dad.\n\nBecause my dad worked at a movie studio, he wasn't a director or anything important.\n\nBut he made all the set parts and even knew how to make robots and androids for the movie.\n\nDad never really showed up at home except during Christmas or Thanksgiving or when it was my birthday.\n\nBut then I got the surprise of my life.\n\nI was sitting on the couch in the living room playing my video games when my phone rang.\n\nConfused I picked it up and my eyes lit up when I saw it was my dad calling.\n\n\"Dad, your calling, are you all right?\"I shouted, probably blowing his ears out.\n\n\"I'm fine Alexander, calm down. I was wondering if you wanted to come see me for a few days,\" my dad said.\n\n\"Wait, you mean come to the studio?\" I said.\n\n\"Sure, I asked the boss and he said if it was fine, just ask your mother about it and if she says yes, I'll see you soon,\" the dad said.\n\nThen he hung up. After that, I got up and headed into the kitchen where mom was.\n\nI told her about what my dad had asked me to do and she told me I could, and I gave her a tight hug.\n\nAnyway, a few days later, I was all packed up and ready to go see my dad. Now, even though I was eighteen, I could drive.\n\nBefore I left, mom told me to mind my manners and listen to dad.\n\nI nodded, telling her I would before getting into my car with all my stuff, and then I headed off.\n\nAs I was driving, I was wondering what kind of movies were going on at the studio.\n\nDad had helped make all the most popular movies that were playing right now.\n\nMostly, Dad was behind the camera because he did all the set and background things for the movies.\n\nI once told my dad I would make a movie when I was older, and I tried my best, but it never worked out.\n\nA few hours later, I got to the Killer Wood Studio, which was the name of the studio my dad worked at.\n\nWhen I got out of the car, I grabbed my bag and then I turned around, nearly jumping out of my skin.\n\nA grown lady wearing glasses was standing there and she was smiling at me, showing me very bright teeth.\n\n\"Greetings, are you Alexander Prescott?\" The lady asked me\n\n\"Um-yes ma'am,\" I said, still in a bit of shock.\n\n\"Oh thank goodness your father sent me to come get you because he was doing a project and couldn't get away from it,\" the lady explained.\n\nThe lady introduced herself as Sofia, and then she told me to grab my stuff and then told me to follow her.\n\nAs I followed behind her, Sofia started talking about all kinds of things that happened at the studio.\n\n\"This studio first opened in 1920, and it was the very first movie studio to make a scary movie,\" Sofia explained.\n\nMy dad had told me the history of the studio, but I didn't want to be rude, so I just let her ramble on.\n\nAs we were walking, I noticed one building that looked old and broken down, and then I stopped.\n\n\" Hey Sofia \"What's that? I don't think I've seen that before,\" I said, pointing at the building.\n\nSofia turned around and gasped when she saw what I was pointing at.\n\nThen, before she could say anything, she hurried off, and I followed behind her, running to keep up.\n\n\"What is it, Sofia?\" I asked as I got up right next to her.\n\n\"You don't want to go in there, young man; that's the robot graveyard,\" she said.\n\nThen, before I could ask her what that was, she told me where the studio area where my dad worked was.\n\nThen she hurried off, and then I headed into the building, and the smell of paint hit me in the nose.\n\n\"I need more blue paint,\" I heard a voice say.\n\nI followed the voice and then noticed my dad, who was painting, and he had two other guys with him.\n\nI watched as they were painting a background, and then dad turned around, and when he saw me, he smiled.\n\n\"Alexander, you made it,\" he said as I ran over to him.\n\nBoth of us hugged each other, and then I looked over dad's shoulder and saw the background he had been painting.\n\n\"What do you think?\" He asked, grinning.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" I said, grinning at it.\n\n\"Well, since you're here, you can help me with cleaning up,\" my dad said, grinning at me.\n\nI rolled my eyes and smiled and then headed over to start cleaning things where I noticed one of the guys.\n\nHe then introduced himself as Cal and smiled at me as he helped me clean up the mess.\n\nWhile I was cleaning a paintbrush, I was thinking about what Sofia had said.\n\n\" What are you thinking about, kid?\" Cal asked.\n\n\"Well, this lady I was with told me to stay away from this place called the robot graveyard,\" I said innocently.\n\nAll three of the men gasped, and I looked at all of them confused.\n\n\" What did I say that was wrong?\" I asked nervously.\n\n\"You don't know what the robot graveyard is, do you?\" Cal asked me\n\n\"Cal, don't you dare tell my son what that place is; he doesn't need to know,\" the dad said.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Buzzkill, you're the boss,\" Cal said, raising his hands.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I was done cleaning, and Cal and the other guy told my dad that they were going to get some lunch.\n\nAfter they were gone, Dad sat down at his desk and then looked up at me.\n\n\"I'm guessing you want to know what that robot graveyard thing is, don't you?\" Dad asked me\n\n\"I mean, it would be nice to know,\" I said, leaning against the nearest wall.\n\n\"Well you see, the robot graveyard is where the owner of the studio puts all the robotics and machines that don't work,\" dad explained.\n\n\"Wait there just put in some random building and not thrown in the trash\" I said annoyed.\n\n\"I agree with you, son, but I can't argue with the boss and some of my coworkers say that the place is haunted,\" dad said.\n\n\"Woah, hold on a second, haunted how?\" I asked, looking at him.\n\n\"There's this one robot we tried to use for a movie but it never worked right, so we tossed it into the robot graveyard and some of the workers say that robot was haunted,\" my dad explained to me.\n\n\"Didn't you make that robot?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Of course I did and no, I'm not a witch or a wizard, so I don't know what happened to that robot, but enough about that. How's your life going?\" Dad asked.\n\nI told him everything that was happening in my life and he smiled at everything, even the bad things that had happened.\n\nAfter that, dad told me he was heading to the main studio and asked if I wanted to come along.\n\nSo I followed behind him as he headed to the main studio, thinking about that robot graveyard the whole time.\n\nWhen we got to the studio, I slapped my hands over my ears. It was very loud inside the place.\n\nDad didn't bother saying anything, so we just headed off to the watching area with the camera guys.\n\nThey all smiled when they saw us, and I watched the scene that was going on in front of us.\n\nThe actors were having a big fight scene, and I was smiling like a baby who had a whole bag of candy.\n\n\"Cut!\" A loud voice shouted, making me jump.\n\nA man was sitting in a chair, and then he turned around and glared at us.\n\n\"Patrick, I thought I told you not to come in here when we're filming a scene,\" the man said.\n\n\" I'm sorry sir, but my son is here visiting me and he wanted to see the movie being made,\" dad said, grinning nervously.\n\n\"Well, you have to leave because we're very busy,\" the director said.\n\nWith that, my dad took my arm and led me out of the room, telling me that we were going to head to the hotel.\n\nHe told me that he slept there when he was done with work, but when we got to our room, I started texting on my phone with mom.\n\n\"Hey kid, I'm going to check on the background for the movie. I'll be back in a few minutes. Just stay here,\" he said.\n\nI watched as he walked out of the room and then he was gone. An hour later, the sun was starting to go down and he was still gone.\n\nI got bored of using my phone, but then I figured out something I could do, and I grinned a smile covering my face.\n\nI was going to check out that robot graveyard, but then I got up and grabbed my phone before heading out of the hotel.\n\nI then headed to the studio and then noticed the gate was locked, and then I actually climbed over the gate and landed on the other side with a small thump.\n\nRunning off, I headed to the robot graveyard, and when I got there, I noticed that the building was locked and I sighed softly.\n\n\" Darn it,\" I grumbled under my breath.\n\nI then looked around and then felt around in my pockets, wondering if I had anything that would pick the lock.\n\nBut I didn't then I looked down and noticed a bright green hairpin and smiled as I bent down to pick it up.\n\nI then started fiddling with that lock on it before it popped off and the door opened.\n\n\"Bingo!\" I said, looking around.\n\nI realized the room was super dark and I felt around on the wall, noticing there was no light switch.\n\nSo I took out my phone and then I flipped the flashlight on my phone on and looked around.\n\nI noticed there were machine parts everywhere, and then I started walking deeper into the building.\n\nAs I walked past a pile of old robot parts, something grabbed my ankle and I jumped.\n\nWhen I looked down, I noticed half a robot sticking out of the pile \n\n\"Please help us,\" it said in a tiny voice.\n\nMy mouth fell open. Maybe it was because this part of a robot was talking to me, but still I couldn't help it.\n\n\"With what?\" I asked nervously.\n\n\"Save us from the robot master,\" the tiny voice said, sounding scared.\n\n\"W-why?\" I said, looking at it.\n\n\"Because he'll kill us all if you don't,\" the little robot said.\n\nI headed off and then I saw it. Standing in the middle of this room was a giant robot.\n\nIt was wearing a trench coat and it looked like it was also human. It then turned around and I almost dropped my phone.\n\nI then noticed it was missing an eye, so where an eye should be was a black hole.\n\n\"Do you like what you see, human?\" It asked in a dark voice.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, backing up\n\n\"I'm the robot master and everyone here listens to me, including you,\" he said, pointing at me \n\n\"But I'm not a robot,\" I said, looking at him.\n\n\"I don't care,\" it hissed.\n\nBefore I had time to run, the robot master snapped his fingers and then I heard this horrible noise.\n\nI turned around and saw robot parts like arms or legs and others heading straight towards me.\n\n\"What the heck?\" I shouted, jumping as an arm shot towards me.\n\n\"Kill the human if you have to! \" The robot master was shouting.\n\nI kept jumping over and ducking under robot parts. I had noticed that it was a bit brighter in the room.\n\nI then ran off and kept running as I heard robots shouting and laughing, but then, like an idiot, I tripped and landed on the ground.\n\nI turned around, looking over my shoulder, and saw the robot parts and the robot master heading right for me.\n\nI backed up until I hit a wall. I couldn't move. I didn't want to. I was willing to let these robot parts kill me.\n\n\"Stop!\"I shouted at all the machines.\n\nI then slapped my hands over my eyes, waiting for the robots to do their thing, but nothing happened.\n\nI took my hands off my eyes and noticed that the robot master and the robot parts weren't moving; they were frozen in place.\n\n\"What the-\" I mumbled under my breath.\n\nI then got up and ran out of the robot graveyard, and I noticed it was getting to be night time.\n\nSuddenly, I bumped into someone. At first, I thought it was the robot master, but then I noticed it was Sofia.\n\n\"Alexander, what on earth are you doing here?\" She was shocked to see me.\n\nI didn't tell her. I just looked at the robot graveyard, wondering if the robots were going to follow me.\n\nShe must have seen me looking at the robot graveyard because she gasped in shock.\n\n\"You didn't go in there, did you?\" She asked me\n\nI nodded nervously before standing up I started to head off, but she grabbed my arm.\n\nSofia said, pulling out her phone. \"We have to tell your dad, I'll call him.\"\n\n\"No, you can't!\" I shouted at her in fear.\n\nThen, before she could do anything else, I ran off, heading to the gate so I could go to the hotel.\n\nBut I stopped when I saw Cal and the other painter guy in front of me, and they both had their arms crossed.\n\n\"Alex, you can't leave until your dad gets here,\" Cal said.\n\n\"But I need to. I'm going to get tracked down by those horrible robot parts,\" I said in fear.\n\nI turned around to run the other way, but Sofia and someone else were blocking the way.\n\nIn fact, it seemed everyone else who worked at the studio had made a circle around me, so I couldn't run away.\n\nThen they all started talking at once, telling me I couldn't leave and not to worry and that my dad would soon be here.\n\nI slapped my hands over my ears, screaming at everyone to stop talking and shouting, but they wouldn't.\n\nSuddenly, a jolt went through my body and my hands fell off my ears.\n\nI then shut my eyes and bent over halfway breathing heavily. I couldn't move or speak. All I could see or notice was darkness \n\n\" Everyone out of the way, give me some space,\" a voice behind everyone else said.\n\nMr. Prescott shoved past the crowd and looked at his work. He sighed softly.\n\n\"What happened to the android?\" Sofia asked Mr. Prescott.\n\n\" I'm not sure, Sofia, but I'll take a look at it really quickly,\" Mr. Prescott said.\n\nHe then walked over to the android and lifted the T-shirt up from its back.\n\nIt revealed a closed compartment on the back, and Mr. Prescott popped it open before looking around.\n\nThe wires were in a few of the plugs, but they looked fine, and Mr. Morris gasped when he saw the problem.\n\n\"What is it, sir?\" Cal asked Mr. Prescott.\n\n\"It's main computer chip is fired, that's why it shut itself off,\" Mr. Prescott said.\n\n\" Do you think you can fix it, sir?\" Someone else asked Mr. Prescott\n\n\" Yes I can, but Sofia, can you call my wife and tell her the android got shut off?\" Mr.Prescott  said.\n\nSofia nodded and then ran off to go call Mr. 'Prescott's wife, and then he looked at Cal.\n\n\"And Cal you help me fix this thing? It's going to take too long with just one person,\" Mr. Prescott said.\n\nCal nodded and watched as Mr. Prescott grabbed the android and threw it over his shoulder.\n\n\"Back to the drawing board,\" he muttered as he walked off.",

        "title": "Pompeii Inferno [Part 2]",
        "author": "_thelonewolfe_",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fpzii/pompeii_inferno_part_2/",
        "text": "\\[[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10evclw/pompeii_inferno_part_1/)\\]\n\nThat of course, brings us to the final day of production, collectively called “V-Day” by both the trades and the survivors who were there that day.\n\nThe “big eruption” scene.\n\nIt was time to lay waste to the carefully constructed town of Pompeii with a series of controlled explosions filmed from 10 different angles, the picture’s “money shot”. It should have been the icing on the cake, an SFX-heavy extravaganza to cap off the end of the film. The preceding days leading up to the final day of shooting had gone by uninterrupted, and there was a genuine feeling amongst the crew that the worst was behind us. Several actors whose roles had already been finished decided to leave early rather than stay behind, no doubt spooked by Leah’s sudden passing. It’s hard to remember any of the good times before “The Last Supper”, everything from before then seems to have evaporated into a poisonous fog. All that stands out now is the nightmare that came afterward.\n\nI got to the set early that day. There’d been a deep pit in my chest the entire week, a constant fear of another disaster just waiting around the corner. Most of the cast and crew had moved on, Evelyn doing most of the backbreaking labor of boosting morale. She had a real knack for lifting just about anyone’s spirit, just being a good set of ears and a shoulder to lean on. Still, I was scared, petrified even. Security had been on high alert, though the three checkpoints to get on set did little to ease my nerves. It was nice to cruise specific parts of the set before everyone else showed up, especially when trying to get inspiration for a scene. \n\nThat day, I was just enjoying the peace. That part of the “city” had already been struck with molten debris in the film and thus was in a state of disarray. Piles of crushed neon and “rubble” lay in just about every direction and the flickering lights had not been turned off from the previous night. It was eerie, to say the least, made worse by the fact that Leah had been discovered only a block away from this site. I looked upwards towards the scale replica of Mt. Vesuvius, instantly imagining the peak blowing straight off, allowing the raw heat of planet Earth to come spilling out.\n\nI stood still, basking in that misty early morning, allowing myself to find comfort in this last pocket of peace before the storm clouds moved in permanently. Without thinking, I took out my camera and snapped a photo of our recreated volcano, on the very last frame no less. This photo was truly worth a thousand words and many would later go on to compare it to the famed “last photo” of Mt. St. Helens taken right before its eruption.\n\nThe SFX involved with the controlled demolition was nothing fancy and had been used hundreds of times before. A series of hydrogen gas canisters had been placed at strategic spots all along the ridge of the volcano, timed to go off in sequence when detonated from a safe distance. The canisters had been set to continually fire off short bursts of fire for added atmosphere with several tons of prepared ash and soot following right. The “main eruption” would simply consist of a collection of canisters that would fill the space inside the volcano with a predetermined amount of gas that would be enough to blow up the sectioned-off peak but not enough to cause catastrophic damage.\n\nThat was the promise.\n\nWe were told it had been tested numerous times, first on scale models then full-size replicas. All out in the desert, all heavily supervised, and all went off without any trouble. The margin for error had been so thin, not once did anyone suspect something like V-Day could have happened.\n\nThe scene was to feature Evelyn witnessing the main eruption from her mountainside villa, only for it to be engulfed by the pyroclastic cloud. The twist would be that Evelyn would dive into a pool and swim safely to an underwater bunker where she’d be rescued by Mario later. A trap door was in place inside the bunker to allow Evelyn a safe exit. Emergency sprinklers had been scattered throughout the set just in case, but the likelihood of a fire breaking out had always been assumed to be minimal.\n\nWe began on time, our first shots of the day featuring Evelyn alone in her villa, waiting for Mario to arrive, both unaware they'd waited too late to leave Pompeii. We broke to go meet up with Mario, who’d be in his car racing through the ruined Pompeii trying to rescue his love. A second unit would stay with Evelyn while I stayed on the ground level with Mario to film with him before making our way back up the mountain.\n\n“*Dead silence. No music, no dialogue, not a single breath. The looming Vesuvius, smoking, and bellowing with life, gives no warning to the armageddon that’s about to unfold*”\n\nThat’s what it read in my script, the final build-up to the big boom. Our \"boom\" would commence on my word, just three beats after “*Action!*”. Everyone was in place, our SFX guys standing by to begin the sequence, Mario looking much worse for wear, if only due to the excellent makeup work done by our team. From behind the wheel of our mounted car, he flashed a thumbs-up that he was ready to go. I did the usual director bit, announced places, confirmed everyone was safe and secure from the blast, then took a long, deep breath before initiating the countdown.\n\nThree…\n\nTwo…\n\nOne…\n\nYou were expecting the boom, right? So were we. Nothing had happened though, not at first. There was no explosion, no fire, not even the slightest hint of danger. I immediately asked our SFX guys to check the canisters, to which I got no response. I called out again over the radio, but still nothing but radio silence. Panic was quickly settling in so I gathered some of the crew to join me in figuring out what was wrong. Mario joined us in a golf cart and we began making our way up the volcano when it finally happened. There was no warning, no rumble, no smoke, nothing. Just an unearthly silence, followed by…\n\nBOOM!!\n\nTwo minutes.\n\nThat’s how long the top of our volcano had been filling with hydrogen gas when the canisters finally ignited.\n\nTwo minutes is all it took for our lives to turn into a living vision of hell.\n\nOne instant we were driving up the side road towards Evelyn, the next everything in sight was burning with the bright intensity of our hot sun. The earth shook harder than I thought possible as my vision dissolved into a messy blur of black and orange. The force of the blast ruptured both eardrums instantly, leaving only a dull piercing screech as the only thing audible. The golf cart twisted out from under us, launching everyone from the vehicle in separate directions. I was just barely able to get on my feet when the first piece of debris landed right in front of me, missing me by mere inches. One glance upwards towards the wrecked volcano was all I could get before the next flaming mass of molten styrofoam came crashing down. A small chunk managed to hit my right thigh, instantly causing second-degree burns all down my leg. The searing hot pain almost sent me back to the ground, and I tried running to one of the makeshift dressing rooms behind the city facade only for another burning pile of foam mountain to tear right through it.\n\nIn the distance I could hear faint screams and panicked cries as the cast and crew fled in all directions, trying to escape the fiery cataclysm we’d just unleashed. I looked around me, desperately searching for any of the comrades who’d accompanied me, but I could neither see nor hear much of anything through the growing fire and smoke. It was a monstrous sight to behold, one ripped right out of the same books that had inspired me in the first place. The ruined peak of Mt. Vesuvius had blown clean off, leaving only a gaping hole surrounded in flames. I looked up to where Evelyn’s villa had been only moments before, but there was nothing to be seen in the enormous fireball that quickly consumed the entire mountainside.\n\nIt was my absolute worst nightmare come to life. Only it was so much worse because there was no waking up from this. If I wasn’t on the precipice of hell, I would have taken full advantage of this by filming every minute of it. Seconds later, the canisters malfunctioned and flames began shooting up all down what remained of the volcano, adding even more fuel to the fire. A desperate cry from somewhere nearby broke me from my trance, and I frantically searched for its source. It was Mario. He’d slid down an embankment and was now pinned to the ground by the shredded golf cart. I had no time to move to help him, as another flaming chunk of the mountain crashed down right beside me and rolled down the hill, slamming right into Mario and the golf cart, carrying the two out of sight.\n\nThis was it. My life, my dream, my movie, everything literally up in flames with me standing there, powerless to stop it. Those were my final thoughts before another piece of flaming debris fell from the sky and mercifully put me out of my misery.\n\nThe next thing I can remember is waking up in the hospital, tubes and needles seemingly sticking out of every part of me. My hearing was still essentially gone, my vision blurry, and the pain excruciating. Thankfully, my screams of agony would bring on a torrent of drugs that would keep the pain at bay for the rest of my time there. Consciousness would flow in and out over the next two weeks, but eventually, my hearing would return little by little. My vision would likewise come into focus just as quickly.\n\nIt was called a miracle recovery by my doctors, who’d initially predicted I wouldn’t make it through surgery. I was shown the large piece of steel rebar that had been removed from my skull just three weeks prior before asking to see a mirror. Before doing so, the doctors advised that in a few months, cosmetic surgery could “patch up” any major damage left. My reflection told a much bleaker story, as my right eye socket was twisted inwards grotesquely while my left lip was curled downwards into a permanent half frown, all visible from behind the curtain of scorched flesh. Though far from beautiful beforehand, I now bore resemblance to a Frankensteined voodoo doll.\n\nThe police would show up the very next day, as was to be expected. I asked immediately about Mario, about Evelyn, about any information on the explosion. The doctors had refused to say anything about the accident while also heavily restricting access to any sort of outside media, thinking it was in my best interest to “heal in peace” until the police arrived. The detectives couldn’t tell me much, giving the usual “open investigation” bullshit, just wanting to check up on me and let me know they’d speak with me more once I was discharged.\n\nMy convalescence would last only a few more days despite the doctors wanting to keep me for a little while longer, curious about the nature of miraculous recovery. I was too eager to get out and clear my name of any potential wrongdoing, as I had feared would be the case the entire time I was hospitalized. Those fears were initially proved to be correct when I arrived at the police station only to be immediately taken to an interrogation room. I could tell my appearance was rather off-putting to the detectives, as they paused often and would sparsely look me straight in the face. I did my best to maintain an easygoing facade, but it quickly crumbled as the integration wore on. Not because of any accusations or fears of what may happen to me. But from the sheer gravity and loss of the disaster.\n\nSix people in total, including Evelyn and two of the crew members that were with me, had died in the initial blast. 25 more were still hospitalized, Mario among them. With Leah, that brought *Pompeii Inferno’*s body count to seven. Six of the seven bodies had already been retrieved and identified, with Evelyn’s body being the last uncounted. It was agonizing, each new piece of information only driving the knife in deeper. The entire studio lot had caught fire due to the explosion, and the marginal sprinkler system only bought enough time for an evacuation of the lot. By the time firefighters arrived though, there was little they could do besides put out the smoldering ruins. Outside of the front offices and one sound stage, the studio was writing off the entire lot as a loss. The only good news it seemed is that the investigation had already largely wrapped, and the culprits behind the “attack” had already been uncovered.\n\nThat was the first mention of the word “attack”. Up till that point, I’d assumed the accident had been just that, an accident. A grave miscalculation on our part or something faulty with the SFX, but still an accident. It couldn’t have possibly been an intentional attack. I feared the worst and prepared myself for an onslaught of intense questioning. The detectives started by asking about Mario and what my relationship was like with him, with his fans. They kept asking about fans and if I’d seen anyone suspicious on set. I answered no, that our relationship was cordial but not close, and that I never had any interaction with Mario’s fans. The detectives pressed on, asking questions about the studio, the hiring process, and then about the SFX involved with the explosion. I did my best to answer their questions, but I was more than a little confused by the seemingly random line of inquiry. It was exhausting, made worse by my ongoing withdrawals from the pain medication.\n\nThe interrogation, as it were, went on for over five hours. During that time, the detectives would try to play me against Mario, try to get me to “confess”, stating that they “knew everything” and that Mario would talk once he was released from the hospital. They threw every trick they could at me, but it didn’t work. Because there was nothing to tell. I had nothing of value to add to their investigation, no motive to want to blow up my own movie set. I was defiant to the end, finally throwing down the “lawyer card” to end the relentless questioning. Though I was left with the warning that the detectives would see me again should they uncover any lies or holes in my story.\n\nThe ensuing weeks blurred together, each day spilling faster into the next. Reporters, tabloids, friends, and everyone in between lined up outside my door, trying to get “the scoop” from me. That first night alone was the worst. I was finally able to get the full story, at least what was being made available to the public, from various newspapers and tabloids. “Intentional sabotage”, that's what the police and the studio were saying. The MDMA incident, Leah’s death, the “eruption”, it was all connected, all a part of a dastardly scheme to take out “America’s Golden Boy”.\n\nMind you, that’s what the official story would end up being. From surveillance footage, eyewitness accounts, and an internal investigation by the studio itself, it had been determined that a cell of radical extremists had infiltrated the production and plotted to destroy the film and studio. Why you may ask? Well, that’s the question no one was ever able to answer conclusively. Over 10,000 photos of Mario, myself, and the rest of the cast had been found amongst the accused’s possessions, along with that bizarro manifesto that talked about “bringing a fire of brimstone and horror to Hollywood”. They made a lot of fuss in the press about it, though I’m not sure why as it was essentially illegible, with only a few recognizable names and vague threats legible.\n\nWhat is known is that security camera footage caught several crew members moving in and out of the Mt. Vesuvius set throughout the days leading up to the disaster. Tracing back footage, they were able to track the group to the same hotel most of the cast and crew were staying at, which included Leah. Further analysis of the security camera footage from that night also revealed the same group of people loitering around the lobby and car lot during this time, only for the footage to conveniently cut out before Leah’s actual disappearance.\n\nThat seemed to be a common theme throughout the unfolding investigation, “convenience”. How convenient it was that the crew members staffed with setting off the explosion had been the ones caught loitering in the lobby before Leah’s disappearance. How convenient it had been that various pieces of evidence such as MDMA were found inside said crewmembers' hotel rooms. How convenient it was that Mario and I, the alleged targets of this insidious attack, had both miraculously survived what should have been life-ending injuries. A series of coincidences, none suspicious on their own, but when looked at from afar, tell a story that leads right back to one person and one person alone.\n\nSo why did no one but me see it?\n\nTruth be told, I don’t blame you all for believing his lies. He was an incredible actor after all, and the “attack” story made for salacious headlines that captured the hearts of millions across the world. Though fringe outlets and conspiracy theorists would endlessly speculate as to the root cause of the disaster, Mario and his reputation would survive the fallout completely unscathed, his pretty face included. His case was called another “medical miracle”, just as mine had been. Second and third-degree burns covered 75% of his body, along with a nearly severed left leg. The leg would never fully heal, and he would walk with a noticeable limp from that day forward. But the rest of his injuries would heal and soon he was back in front of the camera, the new poster boy of Sunrise Studios. I never visited him after my release, nor did he attempt to reach out to me after his. I’d failed to listen to my gut when I had the chance and seven people had paid the ultimate price. I was determined to never let such a grave miscalculation happen again.\n\nMy fall from grace was thankfully a swift and merciful one. Sunrise executives, including the same woman who’d first offered to acquire *Starry Eyed* for the studio, arrived at my home a few days after my discharge and interrogation. She was polite but to the point when detailing the fallout and financial consequences of V-Day. *Pompeii* had been shut down permanently and was in the process of being written off as a tax liability. Due to it being shelved and unseen by the public, the studio stood to make most of its money back. The entire Seattle lot, however, had been condemned and was scheduled to be demolished and sold. Various lawsuits had also been filed by both survivors and victims' families, with many more soon to come. The studio was in a bind, and with the relentless bad press and outside pressure mounting, it had been decided that our working relationship could no longer go forward.\n\nSurprisingly, I didn’t fight it or even try to negotiate. The deal presented to me was more than favorable, with a nice seven-figure sum in exchange for “canceling” the remainder of my contract, as well as an additional seven-figure offer for the complete ownership of *Starry Eyed*. It may have been difficult for some, parting with the only thing left untainted by the disaster. For me, it was just another piece of deadweight chaining me to the past. There was nothing I could do to restore the lives I’d taken, no direction for me to go but forward. Indeed, I had to cut out the rot from the inside if I stood any chance at redemption. I signed the deal just as fast as I’d signed all the others before, hoping to leave Hollywood and *Pompeii Inferno* behind me for good.\n\nThose first few years after my banishment from Hollywood were excruciating, made only worse by the relentless hordes of paparazzi and Mario fans hounding my front door every day. Changing addresses would only result in a temporary reprieve before my location was leaked to the press. For several years I became a virtual recluse, only venturing outside for the occasional walk or essential item. With very little left in the way of family and friends, my isolation only grew as the disaster slowly faded from public memory, becoming yet another piece of “yesterday's news”. Though the relative peace was welcome, it left nothing else to distract me from the pain and loss of that day. The guilt ate me alive from the inside, my dreams haunted by the smoldering faces of all those who’d lost their lives because of me. It became a cancerous tumor that slowly drained away any remaining willpower I had left. Suicide was a daily topic of thought and for many years, I would sleep with a loaded gun right under my pillow. During those nights, it was the only comfort I had left in this world; the knowledge that should the weight become too unbearable, at least I had a way out.\n\nHowever, the strength and will of the soul cannot be underestimated. After almost five years of wallowing in self-pity, I finally began to reemerge into society. My uncle, one of the only remaining family members I had left, convinced me to return to university in an attempt to find my new passion in life. It was there that I would rediscover my long-dormant interest in astronomy. Over the next few years, I earned my education degree and began to start my new life. It was difficult at first, as the ever-present paparazzi would show up at any given opportunity to further harass me and my loved ones. There was also the occasional run-in with the diehard Mario fanatic, which always ended in the filing of a new restraining order. These incidents would become more sporadic and as the years continued to go by, my strength slowly returned. Day by day, hour by hour, I found myself again.\n\nAnd that’s how the story should have ended. But as we know, that’s not what happened.\n\nThrough sheer willpower and determination, I’d managed to pick up the shattered remains of my life and rebuild them into something new. It was exhilarating, giving impassioned lectures on the nature of the cosmos and sparking conversations that lasted for hours after class had ended. My students all loved me, even the few scattered Mario fans that knew of my brief stint in Hollywood. I had my reservations, becoming instantly paranoid the moment Mario or Pompeii Inferno was inevitably brought up. But as the years went by, interest in the disaster waned until it eventually dried up completely. I let my guard down, stopped moving every few years, and eventually settled down in my home state of Western Kentucky, content to live out the remainder of my life as a college professor.\n\nAll of that would come crashing to an end during one fateful afternoon in early 2022 when I came home to find a plain white envelope with my name written on it, the Sunset Studios logo visible in the right corner.\n\n40 years.\n\n40 years of peace and tranquility, undone in an instant by a single letter. I wasn’t sure if I should even open it. My hands trembled as flashes of V-Day and all the trauma it caused came flooding back, nearly causing me to pass out from hyperventilating. It was more than just the letter itself. The handwriting. I recognized it immediately. Though it had been four decades since I’d last seen it, I knew that ridiculously oversized penmanship anywhere.\n\nMario.\n\nAs hard as I’d tried to block out any industry news, little trickles of information would still find their way to me over the years. I knew that Mario had retired from acting some years ago after becoming the head of Sunrise. Since then the studio had acquired several other smaller studios and was well on its way to becoming the biggest player in Tinseltown. I wasn’t sure what could be in the letter, but seeing as it had been 40 years since the disaster, I eventually thought that surely there was no harm in opening it. I didn’t have to respond and if I didn’t like what it said then I could just throw it away.\n\nIt was so much worse than I could have expected. The letter was from Mario himself, handwritten in the most extravagant cursive I’d ever seen and using what appeared to be gold ink. The wax seal with the studio logo was an especially sickening touch. In a nutshell, the letter was a “peace offering” of sorts. Mario started by apologizing for not being there to fight for me following the incident, writing it was one of the biggest regrets of his career. He said as the head of Sunrise Studios, it was his job to “rectify past mistakes”. The studio would be holding a special film festival in the coming weeks to honor its past cinematic achievements, with plans to screen *Starry Eyed* as its first film. Moreover, Mario stated that he’d personally written the letter to ask if I was willing to present the film during the festival.\n\nIt was a clever idea on his part. On the surface, it was a harmless invitation back into a world I’d left behind decades ago. It’s so easy to say in hindsight I should have known it was a trap. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, the culprits behind the attack were long dead and Mario’s legion of loyal zombies had seen their numbers shrink considerably over the years. Surely the worst was behind me, right? The allure of Hollywood and the silver screen had never truly left, and I still kept my father’s memory alive with monthly trips to the movies and the massive personal library of movies that could easily outmatch any video store. Included in the letter were instructions to claim vouchers for plane tickets, and should I accept the invitation, the studio was fully prepared to pay for all other expenses during my trip.\n\nI could lie to you and say I wanted to say no, that my gut instinct warned me that this was a horrible idea, potentially fatal, and to just shred the letter and move on with my life as I had done all those years ago. But as I said, that would be a lie. The truth is that I did want to go. Not to satisfy my own bruised ego, or to settle some imaginary feud with Mario. My desire to seek the truth, while never truly dead, had dimmed considerably over the years. I’d done well with my life since, far more successful than I’d ever been as a director. I was about to secure a tenured position at my university and several smart investments over the year were just starting to pay off, with my net worth sitting comfortably in the eight-digit realm. Retirement was just within view and I had desired to spend the rest of my remaining years traveling the globe.\n\nYet still, there was part of me that missed the allure of the good life, the unabashed excess of fame and celebrity. Seeing this opportunity, not as an invitation but as a bon voyage, I accepted Mario’s proposal and made plans to visit Hollywood for the first time in 40 years. This was not for me or Mario or Sunset, I told myself, but merely for “old times' sake”. One final chance to enjoy the magic I’d captured in that celluloid bottle over 40 years ago before it too was lost to the sands of time.\n\nA costly mistake that would prove to be my last.\n\n\\[[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10evclw/pompeii_inferno_part_1/)\\]",

        "text": "Recently, I had a conversation with my friend about the nature of life and the universe. During the conversation, I mentioned that I had written a theory about Life in relation to the fourth dimension. Intrigued, my friend asked me to read it to him. Excited to share my thoughts and ideas, I began searching for the note in my Apple Notes. However, much to my surprise and confusion, the note was nowhere to be found. I couldn't help but wonder if I had imagined the entire thing or if I had simply misplaced the note. I searched through my recently deleted notes, but the note was not there either.\n\nMy friend then suggested checking my iCloud account on my laptop, and to my amazement, the note was there. However, the note had been edited 58 minutes prior. The thumbnail showed that the text was still in the note, but the title had been changed to \"New Note.\" This was a strange and unexpected development, and I couldn't understand what was happening. I quickly checked my notes on my iPhone, and the note was there as well, but when I opened it, it was empty with only a checkmark, no text. At the same time, on my laptop, the note's thumbnail changed to show that there was no text in it.\n\nI attempted to shake my iPhone to undo the changes, but it didn't work. I couldn't understand how the note could have been edited and deleted without my knowledge. I was left feeling confused and frustrated, unsure of what to make of this strange occurrence.\n\nAt first, I couldn't comprehend what had happened, but then a strange thought occurred to me. What if there was something about my theory that someone didn't want me to share? What if there were forces at play that were trying to keep my ideas from seeing the light of day? The thought sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that there was something sinister afoot. I began to question everything. Who had access to my iCloud account? Who had the ability to edit and delete my notes? The more I thought about it, the more it seemed like my theory had hit too close to the truth and someone didn't want it to be known.\n\nI can't say for certain what happened to my note or who was behind it, but I know that I can't shake the feeling that something nefarious is at play. All I know is that my theory, my thoughts and ideas that I had spent so much time and energy on, were gone in an instant, and I can't help but wonder if it was all part of some larger conspiracy to keep the truth hidden.\n\nIn conclusion, this experience has made me question the true nature of reality and the forces that control it. It's possible that there are some things that we're not meant to know, and that some people will go to great lengths to keep us in the dark. And I will always wonder what was in that theory, that someone wanted to hide it so bad.",

        "text": "My warm breathe fogged my living room window as I peered out towards the majestic Winter landscape before me. Snow blanketed the changing terrains and danced rhythmically through the air. Knives of ice hung from trees and spread the cold to the frozen leaves. The warm moonlight reflected against every glistening surface and shone a comforting light to fight the darkness. I was entranced by it all. I felt as though I was trapped in a snow globe, confined to this space, helpless to every shake that would engulf my world in another frenzy of white.\n                   \nThe shattering of a wine glass brought my attention back to the inside world. I turned to observe the commotion. My Mother was on her knees gathering up broken pieces of glass. A red puddle had accumulated on the white carpet floor. My Father cursed under his breathe and reluctantly left the room in search of a towel. \n                  \nI watched him as he paced through the black hallway until he was absorbed by darkness and disappeared from view. \n                 \nThe fireplace sparked and crackled while violent flames sent shadows roaming the walls. \n                   \nMy mother came to her feet holding large pieces of glass. The sharp, jagged, ice like spikes poked at my anxiety. Intrusive thoughts penetrated my brain and metastasised to a near panic attack at the mere sight of these sharp objects. \n\nI had never been good with needles or knives for as long as I could remember. My heart would beat three times as fast while my breathe would grow shaky and my face would become flushed. My panic began to decline as my Mother exited the room into the darkness.\n                 \nI calmed myself while sitting in the living room alone, enjoying the peaceful sound of quiet, occasionally interrupted by the crackling from the fireplace. I turned my focus to the outside world. I noticed my hand prints still firmly imprinted on the window from where I was pressed up earlier. \n                 \nSome time passed before I started to question where my parents were. It had been at least ten minutes since I had last seen them before they were engulfed by the darkness. \n                \nThe puddle of red on the carpet had seeped in through the fabric beyond the point of redemption. I became queasy just looking at it. \n                 \nI came to my feet in attempt to look for my parents. Blood rushed to my head as black haze circled around my eyes and my legs became unsteady. \n\nI recollected myself and made my way to the living room door. I peered out into the darkness. The hallway was blacker than black. I gazed cautiously with eyes full of uncertainty. My instincts were drawing me away from the darkness of the hallway. \n                 \nAs I turned to retake my seat in front of the fire. I was chilled by the sound of my Mother calling my name. My ears perked up and I redirected my gaze to the darkness of the hallway. I called back to her but was met with no response. \n               \nI ambled cautiously through the darkness with my arms outstretched in an attempt to get a feel for my surroundings. My fingers reached at nothing as I walked through the empty black void.\n\nMy arms eventually hit the kitchen door frame. I crept my fingers along the inside kitchen wall and patted around in search of the light switch. My fingers came to a stop on the switch box. I flipped the switch up to no avail. I reluctantly walked in further. \n\nMy feet were met with a sudden sting, like stepping on Lego bricks, it sent a sudden jolt through my body. I was trapped in a world of darkness. \n              \nI called out for my Mother and Father again. Once again I was met with no response. \n              \nI was stood in the centre of a dark room with no awareness of my surroundings. I was drifting through a sea of black, with nothing to anchor me to this reality other than the warm sting of my feet. Light spilled into my vision along side a sudden match strike. \n               \nMy whole world suddenly brightened. The light from the match reflected around the room, revealing a black silhouette standing across the table. I screamed till my lungs were out of air.\n               \nThe kitchen was noticeably different. The walls were covered in messy splatters of red that patterned every inch of interior.

        "text": "“Why would I go through all that effort? Over.” I release the button on the side of the handset and toss it on the folded towel laying on the table as I go back to stocking my shelves. I reach down and grab a couple more cans from my wagon, trying not to feel alarmed by the weakness I feel in my thumbs and the exhaustion I feel in my forearms.\n\nI was told that I would have an electric winch so I wouldn’t have to lift my wagon up into my fire lookout tower. I was told that the hook should be loosely connected to a ring at the bottom of the tower, on the inside of one of the legs, right at eye level. I was told that I should only have to clip the sling together under my wagon with the hook from the winch, and then once I climbed to the working level, I’d just have to fire up the generator, push the button with the up arrow, and wait for the machines to handle the weight.\n\nI was told that the Forest Service had seen fit to replace the wire cable in the winch with synthetic rope so I wouldn’t have to risk hurting my hands if the winch was broken.\n\nI’m still not sure if the winch is broken or not, but I know the generator is out of gas. I brought some gas with me, but I left it at the bottom of the tower in the wagon. I’m pissed off about it; you’re supposed to leave some in the tank for the next guy. That was actually in the course work; “Leave some in the tank for the next guy.” It wasn’t some unwritten rule, it was actually three pages in a PowerPoint presentation and a test question.\n\nStill, some of the guys ruck in with their own hunting rifles, and some of them will use up their gas hoisting bucks and bores up into the tower. I guess that’s the type of guy who was here last season.\n\nSo, before I could power on the CB radio and check in, before I could fire up the generator, before I could get the up and down buttons on the winch to work, I had to pull my wagon seventy-five feet up into the belly of my fire lookout tower. Now I’m ignoring the dirty sweat trail draining down the back of my neck, and the raspy wind blowing in and out of my lungs as they try to catch a breath, and I’m restocking my shelves and unloading my wagon.\n\n“It seems like a lot of effort right now, Bill, but you’re going to be out there all by yourself for three months at least,” Joel’s voice carries on his part of the conversation through the tiny speaker in my handset as I get back to stacking cans in my skinny pantry, “Before you know it, it’ll just be something to do to pass the time. Over.”\n\nHe’s my section leader, and he’s in another tower, one about fifteen miles away and accessible by road. It’s at the southern tip of a small range of wooded hills that runs north and south in the middle of a sea of prairie grass. He gets a truck if he needs to resupply, and he can still get a couple of FM stations, but he’s also got to monitor five radios at the same time; one for each of his three watchers, one for the Regional Command Net, and one for communicating with air assets if needed. \n\nI grab my handset from the table and key the mic. “I know I’m going to be bored,” I clarify, “I get that. Why would that make me unbolt my storm shutters, though? That’s what I don’t understand. Over.” The handset lands back on the towel on the table.\n\nI grab a few packs of lantern mantles next; away from the fuel, away from the sink, beneath the food. The course work focused a lot on Field Hygiene. There were the parts that focused on making sure to bathe and do laundry, but there were parts I didn’t expect, too. We had to spend a few days learning where to stock our goods. You always put the food above the counter, for instance. It’s bad enough to find out you punched a whole in a bottle of dish soap, but it’s even worse when the soap drains into your oatmeal. So, the lantern mantles go beneath the food, they have to stay away from the fuel for fire safety, and they have to stay away from the sink because they are supposed to burn eventually.\n\n“Because you can use the storm shutters to line the handrails on your Widow’s Walk. Over,” Joel answers back as I close the drawer farthest from the sink. I turn back to the table, looking expectantly to the handset as I reach for it. \n\nI have no idea what Joel is trying to say. The Widow’s Walk is just the catwalk around the outside of my tower. It’s basically my porch. He’s telling me that, even though the guy who was here before me left the generator empty three months ago, it could have been worse. He’s telling me that some of the guys have taken the storm shutters off of their towers, and he’s telling me that they used the shutters to line the handrail that runs around the perimeter of the tower’s “porch”.\n\n“And what would that do for me? Over.” I ask, some boredom in my voice.\n\n“It would let you go pants-free,” Joel answers back immediately, an old guy’s chuckle carrying the words. I’m about to answer back that he’s being a creep, but I think he expects it. He keeps his mic keyed and explains, “Every time you do laundry, you’re going to have to haul that shit up and down that tower. Even if you’ve got gas, it’s a pain in the ass. So, some guys figure they have to do less laundry if they don’t make the laundry dirty in the first place.”\n\nI stare at the handset for a moment. Joel’s crazy. Joel’s a creepy old son-of-a-bitch. But, Joel sounds like he might just be a crazy, creepy, old, genius; I fucking hate laundry. A thought occurs to me, “So, why would they line the handrail with the storm shutters? Over.”\n\n“Because,” he chuckles back, “You’re standing on the only man made structure for miles, and it’s the tallest thing for just as many miles.” I hear a click as his mic keys off for a split second. He hasn’t said “over”, so he’s not done speaking. The clicks of the mic keying off and on, those are the CB radio version of the word “uhm”; it’s the sound of Joel thinking before he speaks again. When the mic clicks back on, he continues, “Do you really think nothing is watching you? Over.”\n\nA cold shake hits me as I hear those words. I try to think of something to say, some witty comeback to make it sound like that thought hadn’t just left me feeling like I was being observed by aliens. Nothing comes to mind.\n\n“This is some rookie hazing shit, isn’t it?” I incredulously ask, thinking that there’s no way guys go months just wearing their shirt to work every day out here. We’re each fitted with four of the standard forestry service uniforms; dark green pants and yellow, long sleeve, shirts. We’re the type of people who wear that every day, heat be damned. How could anybody with that mindset go months leaving his bits to the elements? I had let the mic click without saying over, meaning I was the one looking for words now. “You’re just trying to get a picture of me hanging low for some wall of shame or something, aren’t you? Over.”\n\nA sound booms across the hills outside. I can’t even think of what it is at first, it’s a sound too loud to echo. It’s the sound of a man howling like a beast in a bear trap. It’s the sound of a demon screaming in terror. It silences everything else. \n\nI grab my binoculars from the table. The old timers and the PowerPoint presentations and the coursework all said to always know where your glasses are, and mine are the other thing lying on that towel I keep dropping the handset on. I wrap the lanyard around my hand as I run for the door.\n\nI need to see what’s screaming, or what’s howling, or whatever the hell that noise is. I’ve only opened the door, none of the storm shutters on the windows. I remind myself of that as I run out the door; the door is on one side of the tower, the north side, so the noise could be coming from any side.\n\nMy eyes catch something, though, as soon as I make it out the door. There’s a wooded area just below a west facing promontory at the end of the ridgeline on my horizon. I see something there, in the gap between the trees and that promontory. I couldn’t even throw a guess at the distance, but it’s far; what I saw could just as easily be a mote of dust, but I don’t think it is. \n\nI figure that whatever I’ve seen, if it’s really there, is going to run through those woods. It looked like it was running in my direction, so I point my binoculars at a pond I see between me and the near side of those woods. Whatever it is, it’s going to break out of the woods right in front of that pond.\n\nI get halfway through wondering how long I’m going to be waiting when I’m almost proven right; in the reflection of the pond water, I see something stop just before the edge of the trees. It stands tall and ragged on two legs, its skin is hairless and weathered, and its every muscle is straining in every motion from beneath dead gray skin. \n\nI can’t believe what I’m seeing.\n\nI know exactly what this is.\n\nDianne is screaming at me from the other side of last night; “They only get dangerous when they lock eyes with you.” \n\nI remember the words as my vision locks on to the burning reflections of its eyes. Part of my mind thinks loudly and ignorantly, “Oh, those two things that look like reflecting pools of burning crude-oil, those dead and starving eyes that I can damn near see my reflection in through these binoculars and that dead still pond, those are the eyes she told me would only get dangerous if I ever locked eyes with them.” \n\nThat same part of my mind speaks again a moment later, only saying a short and embarrassed “oh”, as that part of my mind catches up to the realization made by every other part I could think with.\n\nI’m staring into the reflections of the eyes of a Wendigo.",

        "text": "It was the day of one of my best friends funeral. Unfortunately she had passed away in a car accident. I’ll call her B\n\nI was hanging out with a different group of friends who didn’t know her casually before the funereal that day and was invited out to a water park a few hours away for a party. I had to decline due to my later commitments to attend B’s funeral. \n\nSo I went to another friends place for a bit while I waited for my friend (we’ll call M) to pick me up as he was my ride to B’s funeral. I napped for awhile while there but woke in a panic in fear of missing it and I panicked to check my phone for the time and any texts from M. Turns out he was going to meet me here and walk with me to the location instead of driving, weird but okay. \n\nSo I end up going outside and we start to walk to the location. Just casually talking to M I noticed something strange. I looked up in the sky to see what seemed to be a small ball of clouds far enough to where the moon should be in a bright sky. Then the clouds parted away (sorta like the hands on the moon in the film coralline near the end of the movie) and behind it I saw what seemed to be the earth. \n\nConfused and anxious feelings rushed through every inch of my being and I asked M if he could see what I’m seeing while I pointed to the earth like moon. He laughed as he said “see what?” almost as he knew something I didn’t. I kept asking him more panicked each time and then it got even weirder. \n\nThe colour around us started to change almost as if a lens filter was put over the sun itself and the world almost seemed to melt around us in an array of colour and psychedelic patterning. I looked up at M once more and his eyes started to grow and bulge as of being manipulated by some sort of editing software and his smile growing up the sides of his face like the Cheshire Cat. He started directly at me and all he said was “welcome to the plane of reality”.\n\n\n“What the fuck”\nIt was the first time I ever woke up from a dream and actually said something out loud, despite every dream I have being hyper realistic and indistinguishable from reality. This dream felt different though, it felt way to real to just be a dream. It haunted me for the next few hours and I just kept repeating the words “welcome to the plane of reality” and repeating my post awaking exclamation of “what the fuck” after each replay of the dream in my head. \n\nThankfully I had to stop myself from thinking about it for awhile because I finished up getting reading and got the call that M had just arrived at my house to pick me up to head to B’s funeral.",

        "text": "I had another encounter with this peculiar closet. The grossest and most terrifying experience of my life came from that closet. \n\n\nThis particular day, I picked up a graveyard shift. Similar routine to evening shift, recycling and garbage to be dumped, closet to be walked past. I was on edge the whole walk down that hall. Waiting for the rattling of stretcher wheels, but they never came. I turned the corner and saw the door at the end of the hall. Room 1555. Nothing was out of the ordinary with it until I walked closer. The door started to stretch and warp. Protruding out of the doorframe like an enlarged stomach breathing. \n\"Not right now.\" I said and dropped the bins off at the exit, flipped the door the bird, and headed back upstairs.\n\n\nI gave it a few hours before I went back to finish the garbage, figured I'd let the door calm down a bit. There were no sounds of stretchers, and the door was behaving itself. I exited the basement door, finished up with the garbage, and turned around to head back inside. \n\n\nThrough the little basement window slits I could see the closet. I could see that it was wide open. I gulped, flung open the basement doors, and braced against the wall. No stretchers came flying at me. Maybe tonight the door was going to behave. I approached with caution, grabbed the handle, and pushed it shut. \n\n\nThe door latched softly, and my nose started to pour. Bright red blood ran down my face and onto the floor. I've had nose bleeds (I've picked my nose my whole life), but this was unlike anything. It was like a waterfall, I felt the blood pool up and eject out of my nose like a dam ejecting water. I looked down at my hand. The blood on my fingers was being pulled towards the handle. I immediately let go of it, causing my nose to completely dry up. I looked down at my scrubs, completely ruined. I've cleaned surgical scrubs and operating rooms, and this was the most blood I have ever seen. Well, that was until I did garbage again. \n\n\nI got myself changed, got the blood cleaned, and went to sleep the rest of my shift away. Something was strange when I went back to Room 1555. It looked like the door handle was already wiped. I bled all over it. I decided I wasn't dealing with more bodily fluids after I've seen that much come out of me.\n\n\nA few days passed by, and I picked up another graveyard, I made sure to bring extra scrubs, and I took a roll of gauze from the Emergency Room, just in case. That time of night rolled around, meaning I had to face the closet again. I  peaked around the hall corner, and the door appeared normal. I felt my nose; dry. So far, so good. I got closer to the exit and closer to the closet. Everything was in order, no nose bleeds, quiet empty halls, and an ordinary closet door. Like the night before, I dumped the garbage and recycling, and like the night before, the closet door opened. I grabbed the gauze from my pocket and shoved it up my nose. Fully prepared this time for Room 1555. I entered the building and grabbed the handle of the closet.  I was ready for my sinuses to fill up with blood, but they didn't. I sighed a breath of relief and latched the closet shut. A warm sensation started in my pants and began flowing down my legs. My head started swimming. More blood than last time, but this time a place lot worse than my nose. \n\n\nI felt the warmth in my underwear, I could smell the iron in the air. I looked down and saw a waterfall of blood pour down my legs, and I could see the blood pooling underneath the door. I ripped my hand away from the handle, but it was stuck. It was like the handle was a magnet, and my hand was made of metaI. My head started to float as my body got weak. Finally, I the handle let up its grip, and I fainted into my puddle of blood. I awoke soon after, my scrubs again ruined with my own blood. The floor that I was sitting on was dry and clean. That couldn't be possible. My entire back and pants were saturated in my own dried blood. I got changed and went home for the rest of the night. This will be the last graveyard I pick up for awhile.\n\n\nWhen I went to write both these encounters on our Room 1555 page and found another new date. January 21 was written previously, January 22, written after. Again, neither dates were signed.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cbyf2/cause_effect_part_1/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nCarter’s birthday was today. It was supposed to be a fantastic day, celebrating with family and friends. A beautiful day with my family turned into a nightmare. I woke up this morning feeling like shit. I spent most of the night restlessly turning in bed, dreaming terrible things. I can’t remember most of my dreams, but this was different. This one has been sticking with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember that I was in a room full of curtains. Not like house curtains or shower curtains. Hospital curtains. The kind that separated patients. I was standing in an aisle looking towards an open door, past the rows of curtains. Someone came into view inside the doorway, but I couldn’t identify any features—just a dark blur in the dimly lit entrance. A breeze came through the aisle, rustling the curtains on each side. It came to a stop when a noise to my side startled me. *Beep... Beep… Beep.* A chill ran down my spine as I looked to the side where the sound came from. The curtain nearest me, to my left, slowly opened. My breath caught in my chest when I tried to inhale.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe opening curtain revealed a heart monitor beeping rhythmically near a hospital bed. The cubicle was dark except for the light on the monitor bouncing up and down to the beat. The hazy light that flickered on the screen was enough to make out a body lying in bed. It was moving, slow and gentle heaves in the dark. As much as I didn’t want to look any further, I was compelled to do just that. My legs felt heavy as I cautiously walked to the side of the bed where the monitor sat. There were barely audible breathing sounds as I approached. When I stopped, just inches away from the bedside, the monitor sounds quickened. Everything in my body screamed to walk away, but I wandered closer, leaning in to find someone familiar gazing back at me. Our eyes locked, and I knew who it was, Ben. The heart monitor rapidly increased its pace, and an alarm began to sound. I could hear frantic footsteps coming from down the aisle.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off him. He looked like me, like Ben, but was different. Glazed eyes, almost dead, peered back at me. Shoes squeaked on the floor, coming to a stop at the opening of the cubicle. Still frozen, eyes locked on Ben, a set of voices spoke behind me. “This is the fifth time this has happened since we stabilized. I’m sick of running down here for nothing.” Someone stepped through and got closer to me. A woman, so close I could feel the heat of her body, stood beside me. Her hand flew out and began tapping the screen; tiny *blip* sounds at each touch. She didn’t notice me. The alarm stopped, but the heart monitor kept a quick pace. “He’ll level out and go back to normal. I want to finish our game of cards. Let’s go.” She turned on her heel and walked away with whoever had come with her. I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eyes flicked back to Ben. His eyes had changed. Alertness had replaced the glazed-over look, and I noticed his hands had started shaking. Bringing one hand over, he started scratching his wrist. I felt the sting in my own, the same I found the message. My eyes darted to my own, watching the skin turn bright red. “Help me” stood out, bolder than before. I winced and cast my eyes back toward Ben. We were looking directly at each other. He could see me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke, panicked. My alarm clock was blaring on my nightstand, six minutes past eight in the morning. I looked around the bedroom to confirm that I was home. *Just a dream,* I reminded myself. Pushing myself up, I sat on the side of the bed. I looked back over my shoulder, checking for Raina. She wasn’t there. I wish she had been. I needed her comfort this morning. My stomach felt like a pit. Rubbing my face and sighing, I left the bed and headed downstairs. When I reached the bottom, I could hear Raina singing from the kitchen. It was her usual start to the day. I found her standing at the sink, rinsing peppers and mushrooms. She turned, hearing me shuffle in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m making omelets this morning. It was Carter’s request. Do you want cheese?” Raina asked. I wasn’t ready to start talking. I nodded and sat at the table, placing my head in my hands. She served me coffee the way I liked, with tons of creamer. “Are you ready for today?” she pressed on, not noticing my lack of attention. “Like any other day, I guess,” I said. “Yeah, but this isn’t any other day. We have everything to pick up, set up, and guests to entertain.” It hadn’t occurred to me yet, that today was our son’s birthday.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrustrated, I sighed. The intense dream didn’t do me any favors last night. I wasn’t ready to face the day’s events. I wanted more than anything to curl up inside myself and scream. Seeing Ben in my dream like that brought back memories I had tried so hard to bury. The truth was, I still cared. I still loved my brother to some degree. I’ve matured enough to know that our circumstances were fucked up. It wasn’t his fault that he turned out that way, and I shouldn’t have left him there. It’s a wonder that I didn’t turn out worse, to be honest. If Raina hadn’t made me go to therapy, I think I would have. I’ve never told her everything. She knows I was abused when I was younger, but nothing more. For her safety and Carter’s, I keep it to myself.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRaina came to me, wrapping her arms around my shoulders from behind. We’ve been together long enough that she knows when I’m upset. She ran her hands down my arms and held my hands. “I’ll take care of the setup and entertaining if you’ll pick up the cake,” she said, kissing my hair. Her dark hair spilled down my shoulders, blanketing my face. It smelled like lavender and vanilla, relaxing me. I couldn’t help but smile, feeling safe in her arms. Her thumb grazed my wrists, making me flinch. She felt the raised scratches and pulled my hand up for further inspection. “Help me,” boldly stands out, as in my dream. Her face said it all—worry, disappointment, and anger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You told me things have been fine,” her voice trembled. My face fell, and I pulled my arm away. “Talk to me, Zavier! You know that you can talk to me”, she insisted. Nothing I said was going to quell the emotions she was having. I was going to have to tell her something. “I’ve been dealing with some intense dreams lately. It’s opened old wounds again, and I can’t handle it”, I half lied. It felt like my heart was in my throat. “You can’t keep chugging along, acting like it doesn’t exist anymore. Your therapist told you that it takes effort and consistency to overcome trauma. You stopped going two years ago, and now look” her frustration was growing. “Today isn’t the day for this. Carter deserves to have his day. I need you to, at least, be present for him. Once the company leaves, I’ll drop him off at my mom’s place. You and I are going to talk to someone about this afterward.” As much as I didn’t want to, I agreed. A few hours of chatting were better than the alternative. Raina took care of everything for the party while I sulked about. Carter had a great day, regardless. I pretended the best that I could, and it was enough. Raina avoided me most of the time, and I was okay with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe party ended about an hour or so ago. Raina left with Carter to drop him off, just as she said. She’s been gone for a little while now, a little longer than usual. I expect she is telling her mom about this morning, hoping for advice. We’ll be headed to Dr. Lowe’s office when she returns. I’m not looking forward to this, but it’ll make things better with Raina again. Talking to the doctor may help to ease my mind from the dread I’m feeling. I’ll update you in a few days to let you know how it went.",

        "text": "\nWhen I was 14….\r\n\r\nWell let’s go back to when I was 10, I guess. \r\n\r\nI was a big fan of John Lennon and David Bowie and Elvis Presley. \r\n\r\nBut I had a condition..\r\n\r\nDexterity/motor skill problem.\r\n\r\nI still have it to this day.\r\n\r\nmy hands are always shaking, And I exhibit the penmanship of a toddler to this day\r\n\r\nI found an old guitar in my grandma‘s closet while we stayed with her in Los Banos before we moved to Reno Nevada From San Jose California.\r\n\r\nMy grandma and grandpa did not  know how the guitar even got there in the first place, but they were old and maybe one of them bought it at one time and forgot.\r\n\r\n  I asked Grandma If could take the guitar. \r\n\r\nI think the guitar was called “Aslin Dane. Ariel Pro III…”\r\n\r\nThis unique strat-style guitar seemed older than the redwoods my family had recently said goodbye to.\r\n\r\nThat was when I was 10….\r\n\r\nWe lived a normal life in Reno after that and we all loved the high dessert and mountain air.\r\n\r\n I was 14 and now and we were assimilated in northern Nevada.\r\n\r\nI had spent four years trying to even play a chord or a note on this mysterious guitar and ground  my fingers away on it daily, but my hands were too shaky.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t write a song.\r\n\r\n I couldn’t do anything.\r\n\r\nI prayed to God, even though it was a joke.\r\n\r\n I didn’t believe in angels or God or the Bible. \n\nMy parents are both atheist my father is a man of science.\r\n\r\n I grew up as an atheist I had no religious disposition at the time.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I got into heavy metal, dark hair, dark music and occult Ouija board shit. Not because I believed in anything really, but because I thought it was cool.\r\n\r\n I was like: “there’s no god anyways so I might as well just be dark as I can be”.\r\n\r\nit was a phase.\r\n\r\nIt was a fad. \r\n\r\nSo, arrogantly, I came home one day. \r\n\r\nI still could not even pretend to play the guitar and I was angry because I thought I deserved talent.\r\n\r\nSo…. midnight one night, I decided to take every family album; every picture of myself that I could find in the house, my yearbooks throughout the years. I took these pictures and I drew pentagrams on my forehead and crossed out my eyes.\r\n\r\nI then lit some candles and I said: “I know there’s no god, because if there was a god I would be able to play this  guitar”\r\n\r\n….I swore allegiance to the devil if he would come right now and show himself and make me able to play.\r\n\r\nMaybe five minutes after I said this out loud and had lit the candles and did the séance… \r\n\r\nWell, i should say that it must’ve been 2004 and there were zero electric vehicles at the time.\r\n\r\nThough there weren’t electric vehicles in those days, I would describe what I heard and five minutes later; slowly prowling up to the front of my house, as an electric car.\r\n\r\n It sounded like a heavy piece of metal moving with no engine.\r\n\r\nAlmost like how the Jetsons ship sounds.\r\n\r\nAnd then I immediately started to sweat cold sweat.\r\n\r\nThe candles were still lit and I swear…across the wall in front of me, I saw an anthropomorphic face… A devilish face, cast a shadow that spread across my closet doors in front of me.\r\n\r\nI was like “well at least the car stopped and they went somewhere else” because another five minutes later it was silent. \r\n\r\nJust when I thought the coast was clear, I heard the rickety glass screen door being pulled open from our front door. It was an incredibly heavy and loud outer-door… But I didn’t hear the actual wooden front door, or anything like the locking mechanisms, nothing like that. So I thought it was just the wind blew this the heavy glass door wide open, so abruptly.\r\n\r\nAfter five minutes or so, I heard heavy footsteps in the house, spaced between at least 30 or 40 seconds.\r\n\r\nThey were coming up the stairs to the second floor where my bedroom was.\r\n\r\nI used to sneak out and smoke pot with my neighborhood friends, so I knew the spots on the staircase to avoid and it seemed like whatever was coming up there, purposely stepped on the loudest parts of it…like they knew the house as I did.\r\n\r\nAnother five minutes in silence, I just think that I’m imagining it all, but then….I start hearing footsteps 30 seconds apart.\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps, taunting me, by stepping on the loudest parts of the sub-floor underneath the carpet of the second landing.\r\n\r\nI tried to convince myself it was a dream, but I was too alert and conscious of what I was trying to summon.\r\n\r\n I could not have slept that night if you paid me $1 million dollars.\r\n\r\nI was wide awake and terrified.\r\n\r\nSo…these footsteps came down through the hallway, to my door and they stopped loudly\r\n\r\nI’m thinking to myself “why won’t my dad get up? I want my mom get up. \r\n\r\nNor did my brothers awake nor my sister…aren’t they terrified too?’\r\n\r\n 10 minutes passed. I didn’t hear anything.\r\n\r\n Then just as I was saying “phew” and wiping the sweat from my forehead; I heard three loud knocks; “boom, boom, boom.”\r\n\r\nI was like ‘this is not happening right now!’\r\n\r\n I tried to get up to turn the candles off and shred the Satanic photos I made of myself, but I’ve never been so afraid and I was unable to move.\r\n\r\n“Boom boom boom!’ \r\n\r\nit was always three knocks… each set louder and louder, until at least 6 or 7 AM.\r\n\r\nThe next day, of course, I was still awake and only opened the door when I heard my family having breakfast. \r\n\r\nI went downstairs and I literally shoved my older brother while he was sitting having eggs and hashbrowns at the table and I accosted him and I said “what the hell man? Why were you banging on my door all night?\r\n\r\nHe genuinely had no idea what I was talking about.\r\n\r\nMy dad‘s room was only 5 feet across the hall from where I was, and my sisters room was literally a foot away from my door to the left.\r\n\r\nNobody heard anything and they looked at me like I was crazy.\r\n\r\nI felt I was crazy.\r\n\r\n I had just stayed up all night listening to this thing pounding like a fireman or policeman at my door and that was when I first genuinely Said a prayer to God.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks later I casually picked up the old creepy guitar that was still in my closet….And I could play. \r\n\r\nI mean, oh, boy could I play. \r\n\r\nBut there was nothing inside of me that was cheerful about this new gift that I was given. \r\n\r\nAnd I always knew from then on out that it was a curse.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have become a protégés guitar, bass player and singer.\r\n\r\nBut every time I write a new song, there is a shadow of my soul standing over me.\r\n\r\nI try to think that, since I didn’t open the door for Satan; that God has rewarded me with the gift to play, but I know that my gift is a curse and I may either already be in hell or I am going that way soon.",

        "text": " It's far more gruesome than The Giving Tree and I suppose the moral is, too. \n\nI grew up in a village in England just on the border of New Forest. The forest was my playground as a child. We’d play hide and seek between the ancient beeches and oaks—trees so old they’d seen dozens of generations of children duck behind their trunks for centuries before me. \n\nAbout twenty years ago, I was playing such a game with my twin brother, Thomas, and the Rooney boys. Morning fog had rolled in from nowhere and suddenly I was *wanting* to be found. I lost my bearings quick. The entire forest suddenly looked the same—skeletal branches, rotting logs, a blanket of crunchy oak leaves that the foggy dew had now softened to silence my steps. \n\nMy mum always told me to sit tight if I got lost. That’s the most likely way to be found. I was smart for a ten-year-old, or so I thought. I stopped stumbling and sat myself down, my back braced against a mossy oak trunk. I did what any kid would do to pass the time and I started picking at the carpet of moss. After pulling off one handful in particular, I froze. \n\nUnder the moss, there were axe marks in the tree trunk. The wood past the bark where the axe had notched the tree wasn’t fresh and blond. The markings were old. Ancient. And they sent stories spinning into my mind. \n\nThere’s a legend in New Forest, one that’s been told for countless centuries. There lies a tree in these woods. One that can grant nearly any wish. If you asked it for gold, jewels or even love, it would happily return these things. \n\nBut the tree was a trickster. You see, nothing it gave you was conjured from thin air. If you wished for gold, it was taken from someone else. You may now be wealthy, but a baron might come looking for your head. \n\nStory has it that a man once asked for the crown of King Edward II. His wish was granted, but a fortnight later the English army broke down his door and pulled him apart with horses.\n\nBut drunks and foolish men didn’t seem to understand. They took the risk. They asked the tree for wealth, and power and vengeance. \n\nOne day a group of villagers ventured into the woods with axes determined to put an end to the circus. They planted their feet, hefted their axes and swung, but it was one of the last things they ever did. \n\nThe tree could infect your mind. Sink its teeth into souls. It’s how it stole gold and murdered noblemen. Legend has it, it’s pollen would infect the brains of a host. So, when these men swung their axes, they only got one notch. After that, they swung for each other’s *necks*.  \n\nNobody dared touch the tree again, but what they did do was make it near impossible to find. They destroyed the trail that led to it. Decades passed, and the tree became legend. Nobody cared enough to find it in an expansive forest. It was a needle in a haystack. And just like that, the tree had fallen into fable until I pulled that moss off its trunk. \n\nI looked up at the tree, fog blew through its branches. “Are you The Taking Tree?” I asked nervously. \n\nThere was no response. I let out a sigh of relief and looked back down to the forest, waiting for Thomas or one of the Rooneys to appear. But then, something caught my eye. \n\nThe moss on the tree trunk was glowing red. I crab-walked backwards in a panic and stayed staring at the scarlet light. Several seconds passed and I crawled forward and peeled away another sheet of the heavy moss. \n\nThere were words glowing on the trunk of the tree. The way the letters shined and glimmered was like the stenciling of The One Ring when Gandalf pulled it from Frodo’s fire.\n\nI stared in disbelief as I read. The words were in older English. Shakespearian. \n\n“I giveth what thee wisheth,” glowed the letters. My heart was pounding in my chest. A nervous excitement rolled through my stomach. *This couldn’t be… this couldn’t be…*\n\nOh, but it was. I thought about just running away, but I couldn’t. This was too good of an opportunity. I knew the tree was a trickster, but I was smart too, or so a ten-year-old was liable to think. \n\nI’d have to play it safe. Small asks. Things that *if* they went missing, no one would care. Or at least things no one important would care…\n\nThere was a boy in school a few years older than me, Ralph Wilder. He was a bully and a son of a bitch. He wasn’t a big kid—feeble and bird boned. Apparently, his family was English gentry, and he had been teased out of his private school for jokes about him being inbred. \n\nHe always had the nicest things—toys, clothes, games. I stared at the trunk of the tree and before I knew it, I was wishing. \n\n“I want a bicycle. Ralph Wilder has the nicest bike in the village. And it sure would be nice to have one like it.”\n\nThe red letters faded before appearing again, “Then thee shalt owenth.” \n\nI heard my name shouted from deep in the foggy forest. I stood and brushed off my legs. “Coming!” I yelled as I jogged away. My head was turned over my shoulder as I watched the letters fade and the trunk return to grey. \n\nThe next morning felt like Christmas, with a tinge of anxiety. I snuck from bed before my parents woke up and went to the back. There was nothing in the yard. But then I saw the door to our shed was open a-jar. I walked skeptically toward it and pulled the shed door the rest of the way open. \n\nThere, leaning again the wall, was a gorgeous youth three-speed. I had never seen Ralph ride it. I wondered if it even was his. It was still somewhat dark, and I took it for a spin around the block before the sun got any higher. \n\nI realized my wish was almost useless. My parents would be skeptical of where I got the bike, and I ran the threat of getting caught by Ralph or whoever was the owner of this bike if I was riding it around the village. I put it back in the shed and threw a tarp over it. I was going to have to go back to the tree. \n\nThis time, I was going to get something I wouldn’t have to worry about taking out in public. I went to The Taking Tree and sat cross-legged. \n\n“Um… thanks for the bike.” \n\nThe tree didn’t light up. \n\n“I’m just wondering, it’s nice and all but what about a Playstation 2?” The tree was still unlit and I cleared my throat. “I wish to have a Playstation 2 put in my living room.”\n\nThe letters started to shine. “Twill’ be so.” \n\nI nodded once in thanks and went back home. I even primed my parents with a good lie. I told them my friend from school was going to give me his old Playstation and they didn’t ask anymore questions. \n\nSoon, I was stacking up games, and wishes. I sold some of them and the bike. I was quickly pilling cash in my room. I was playing it safe and slow, I thought I had the tree beat. \n\nMy brother, Thomas, didn’t ask questions. He was a shy kid, and ever since I’d made my first wish he’d become quieter than usual. Somewhat skeptical of me. Still, he enjoyed playing my video games. \n\nThen I ran into Ralph during breaktime. The tree had been taking nearly everything I’d gotten from him. I’d heard rumors his parents stopped buying him things since they thought he was selling it all. He’d been in a sour mood for weeks. \n\nI held my head high as I passed on the playground one day, and I just couldn’t help giving him a little smirk.\n\n“What’re you smiling about, you little bellend?”\n\nI just smiled wider and kept walking.\n\n“Hey!” Ralph shouted and threw a small stone at my head. “Bugs, I’m talking to you and those buck-teeth.”\n\nI ran my tongue over my teeth self-consciously. I did have a horrendous set. The worst part was that it was the girls who took to teasing me and calling me Bugs Bunny. \n\n“Piss off, Ralph.” I turned and kept walking. \n\nHe speed-walked up to me and punched me in the side. A cheap shot. I collapsed on the ground and was soon taking his kicks to the face. A crowd gathered cheering him on and thankfully, before too much damage was done, a teacher yanked him off. \n\n“You’ll get yours! You cockend loser! I’ll—” I had to catch my breath. “I’ll kill you!” I screamed. \n\n“Come and get me, Bugs,” said Ralph, as he was pulled away by the collar. \n\nAll the other kids stared at me in disgust and pity. I felt wetness on my cheeks and realized with horror that I was crying. I stood up, brushed the dirt off my knees, and walked right off school grounds.\n\nYou can guess exactly where I was headed. \n\nWhen I reached the tree, I was still crying. It spoke with its letters before I asked a question, the first time it ever did that. “What troubles thee child?” \n\nI wiped the snot from my nose and spat. I was too blinded by rage to even think. I just blurted out.\n\n“Dear tree, I wish for a new set of teeth.”\n\n“Tis done,” shined the letters. \n\nI stormed off, an evil grin stretching my mouth.\n\nWhen I got home and cooled down, I realized what a horrid mistake I’d made. I didn’t want Ralph’s teeth ripped out of his head, not only that, but the idea of new teeth being somehow put into my mouth was a nightmare.\n\nSomeone would have to pull my old ones. The pain… the blood….\n\nAfter dinner, I ran back to the tree. “I take back my wish!” I shouted. I stayed still and quiet waiting for a response. None came. \n\n“Did you hear me?! I said I take back my wish!” \n\nThen with an evilness I could almost hear, the letters appeared, “Nay taketh backs.” \n\n“No! I’m wishing to take it back. Do you hear me? I command you.” \n\n“Nay. I commandeth *thee*.” Wrote the tree before fading dark. It was the last thing it said. I shouted for several more minutes, but it never lit up again. \n\nI tried to stay up all night, but it’s something ten-year-olds aren’t very good at. I didn’t even last until midnight. I woke up with a jolt before any of my family did and raced to the bathroom mirror. \n\nI stretched my mouth wide, inspecting my teeth. They were near perfect. I had straight, normal-sized teeth. I started to laugh. Louder and louder until I had to cover my mouth not to wake anyone. \n\nMy wish had worked out again. I snuck out of the house before anyone could see me. I wanted to see Ralph get his. I wanted to hear his mumbled screams when he woke in the morning. \n\nI went to his house and hid in the bushes, snickering like the rotten schoolboy I was. But the door opened, and Ralph walked out casually with his school uniform on. He waved to his mum over his shoulder, and I saw his smile shine. It was no different. A pit dropped in my stomach. \n\nSomething was wrong. \n\nWhen Ralph was out of sight I took off towards New Forest. Twenty minutes later, panting and out of breath, I was at the tree. \n\n“What’s the trick?!” I shouted. “What did I have to do to get these?” I pointed at my mouth.\n\nThe trunk began to glow, but this time there were no letters, just an arrow pointing up. I snapped my head to look toward the top of the tree, but nothing caught my eye. \n\nI walked forward cautiously and suddenly I froze. I saw a small, limp hand on the other side of the tree. It was stained with dried, brown blood. \n\nThe arrow wasn’t pointing up. It was pointing to this. I walked closer. The blood left my face and was replaced by a cold terror that prickled my skin. \n\nThere, slumped against the stump of The Taking Tree, was my brother, Thomas. His mouth was slightly open in a toothless smile. In his hands, he held a pliers. He’d bled to death from pulling his own teeth. “No!” I screamed, dropping to my knees. “No, Thomas!” \n\n“Why?!” I screamed at the tree. “It was Ralph. They were supposed to be from Ralph! \n\nThe bark began to glow, and the tree revealed its trick. \n\n[“Thy twins’ teeth fiteth best.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "I was working the closing shift at my job, I work in a fast food restaurant and let's just say they're know for there chicken. \n\nMe and some of my colleagues were talking about how this place used to be a bank while we were cleaning up. After some research and rumors about it we came to the conclusion that there was a robbery and a little girl was killed years ago in this very building. \n\nAlready creeper out I mentioned how unsettling the upstairs lobby was at night especially in the toilets. Whenever I was cleaning them I would always here,\n\n\"Knocking?\" I was interrupted by my male colleague who was cleaning lobby that night he already seemed spooked and I just nodded back at him.\n\nMy female colleagues was like me and found ghosts really interesting. She claimed to hear it too and said we should try and communicate in some way.\n\nSo I grabbed one of our soft drink cups and placed it high up on a shelf.\n\nI said outloud if there were any spirits here they can come forward and knock it off or give us any other sign.\n\nWe waited but nothing happend so I went back to cleaning.\n\nI was cleaning the other side of front when the cup was launched at me. At first I didn't  register what happend but then I realised and shouted for the others to tell them what happend.\n\nOfcourse they didn't believe me so we checked the cameras upstairs and there it was. Camera evidence of the cup being thrown off of the shelf directly at me.\n\nNext, now me and fc ( female Coworker) were exited and ran to upstairs lobby to see if we would talk with them some more.\n\nMc (male Coworker) followed as he diddnt wanna be alone by himself the whole thing started to Creep him out.\n\nAs we were upstairs looking around waiting for something to happen we heard cries and tears from a little girl comming from our bathrooms.\n\nThis was a bit to much for me and mc but fc claimed we could've just left someone here when locking up and it's best to check.\n\nSo she went in by herself while me and mc stayed outside the toilets because we were both scared out of out mind.\n\nFc came back looking pale. She exclaimed that the crying was so loud in there as if it was coming from our speakers which were off at night and the toilets were empty.\n\nNow all of us were creeper out and finished out closes to go home as fast as we can.\n\nThe morning staff reported to us that they came in to a tip in the morning and the camera footage showed that between early hours of 3am, which I think is a huge coincidence, all the packaging was knocked off the shelf by nothing. \n\nThe asked us if we knew anything about paranormal activities in the work place and we told them what we did.\n\nWe had to \"apologise\" to this spirit of sm. Loudly in lobby thr next night and nothing ever happend again.\n\nThe knocking never stopped tho.\n\n\n\nThe worst part of this story \n\n\nis that it's true.",

As more of me starts to become goo, i question myself: \"What did i do wrong?\". I did not come from a good family, i spent half of my life in a bad part of town, i was exposed to the world too soon, and i strangely got attached to it: the diversities, the bad things, the unknown, i started to like it. It's no surprise that as soon as i knew of the \"organization\", my fate was sealed.\n\nI witnessed the horrors, the eldritch beasts that one day will take my life, i got to know of the shared mind, the project to keep humanity living forever, under the form of slices of the job of everyone here.\n\nI am Mark Hellenmen, memory number 1304, i take care of feeding the things here. I would have never imagined that i would be their food eventually.\n\nI built my career on my love for humanity, and even with my rough past i would do anything to save a fellow human.\n\nThe hive mind project was something of great importance to me, and i would do anything to save it.\n\nTranscript n° 0178446 (27/4/37):\n\n01- Did you do it?\n\n1304- Yea...\n\n01- How many casualties?\n\n1304- About 10, kept it low, as usual.\n\n01- Great job.

Tomorrow you’re all leaving my unit, i will miss you.” shares the counselor. \n\ni raise my hand to speak, as it had to be ingrained into our mind that at all time we should follow etiquette.  \n\n“do we still have to run l-“ \n\nSLAM! The bulky lady bursted open the front doors leading into the commons. I could feel my legs getting warm and my pants getting soggy as she trampled over to me, i couldn’t withstand another beating. There at the program for ‘troubled teens’ you could tell the atmosphere was cold and full of fear. You couldn’t question anything or tell anyone or you would be put into the naughty time room, which is extreme hell, they change the room every time someone comes out so the next person wouldn’t know how to prepare.\n \n“y- yes” i gulped trying not to show fear. \n\nShe opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stops as lights appear from across the parking lot. A mother steps out of her car and over to speak with the lady. \n\n“Excuse me, i’m Dans mom, Agnes. I’m picking him up early because he has a doctors appointment tomorrow.”\nAgnes looks at me squinting profusely.\n\n“Ah you must be Xavier? Dans always tells me how fun and daring you are. One moment i can recall is when he told me you got up onto a table and threw spaghetti at the head mistress, what’s her name again? Hailey was it?”\n\ni looked over at Hailey to study her face to see if she wanted me to respond or not, her face was sorta in a distorted smile with her eyebrows raised. She gestured at me to go talk to Dan and Agnes. i walked over to Agnes’s car where dan and his mom are. \n\n“Dan is it safe to talk, is she listening?” \n\n“No.” Dan whispers softly is a reassuring type way. \n\n“Dan, you gotta sa-“ i almost blurt out but is saved by him putting his hand on my mouth and shushing me.“shh.\n\n“she still has ears you know” dan says\n\ni try to speak again in a more casual manner to not arouse any further suspicion. “Dan, you gotta save me. I can sneak into the back seat and cover myself so she can’t see me. i’m only 13 i still have 5 years when i can get free from this ‘summer camp’.”\n\n“XA- Xavier are you idiotic! that would put my mom and me in danger.” \n\n“I know but-… Dan i need to get out” \n\n“XAVIER HURRY BACK NOW YOU WOULDN’T WANT DAN TO BE LATE.” i hear being yelled from behind me.\n\n“Ah yes one moment please Miss. Hailey.” Dan replies back before i could even get a word in.\n\n“i’ll save but you have to promise me you won’t tell her we were apart of this if it goes south.”\n\n“i promise dan.”\n \n“XAVIER NOW!” echoes though what seems like empty space because hailey was hollering so loudly. \n\ni hurried back to the camp in order to avoid a beating. I went into my room and changed my pants as quickly as possible. I tiptoed across the hard cement floor so i wouldn’t be seen sneaking out of my room, although i’m fairly certain the counselors saw me because we made eye contact but they were in the same boat as me so they let me go. Dan ran through the front doors just in time and leaves me with a quick glance and nod. \n\n“i forgot my belt!!” he said worried.\ni ran through the doors and into his moms car while they’re all distracted by dan. when dan came back to the car i feels sense of relief wash over me. \n\n“i did it, i really did it.” i mumbled shakily\n\nI must’ve forgotten the time as i drifted off into a nap. “WAKE UP! WAKE UP NOW! “huh? Dan?” “THIS IS YOUR FAULT XAVIER WERE ALL GONNA DIE NOW.” i gasped awake in a cold sweat with the picture of dan and agnes snapped necks still vivid in my mind. \n\n“are you ok back there?” by “wait dan you’re alive!? i must’ve had a crazy nightmare” “you sure d- d- d- did” Dans face slowly turned into a huge grin. “we’re dead because of you, you killed us.” the car ran into a tree flinging them both out of the front windshield as the car hurdles sideways…\n\nAnd now here i am writing to you in search of what i should do. I already checked to see if i could feel pain and read. i’m 100% not still sleeping. Earlier I heard and saw a monster jump on top of the car early. The face of the monster was sorta in a distorted smile with her eyebrows raised just as Haileys was. Please pray as i will most likely not make it out of this car alive.\n\nI love you mom and dad if you’re reading this, please kiss the cats for me.",

        "text": " Our history is quite long before we actually got together, and eventually got engaged. I met her at an orphanage. She was this sweet, shy, pretty girl, and I was this dorky, socially awkward clown who tried to make everyone laugh. For me, it was love at first sight.\n\nMaking her laugh made my entire day during those times. And seeing her cry would trigger emotions I never quite understood. It made me want to hurt whatever, or whoever was upsetting Winter. Yes, her name was Winter. Mine was Kira. Which was strange because I did not look Japanese at all, yet my birth certificate had Kira written on it.\n\nMy birth parents abandoned me when I was 2, I don't remember much about them really, sometimes I can see their very blurry faces, with no expressions. I don't like thinking about them. They left me so they don't deserve to live rent-free in my head.\n\nIt was similar to Winter, she too was left at a doorstep of an orphanage, except the difference was, there was no record of her birth, no record of her existence, and she had no name.\n\nSo the orphanage gave her one, they called her Winter, because she blessed the orphanage with her presence during the Christmas holidays.\n\nEventually, though we were separated, I was adopted into one family, while she was into another. I didn't see her for over five years, until one fateful day while walking home from school with some buddies, I spotted her. In the park, kneeling over some flowers. I instantly knew it was her.\n\nI excused myself from my friends and built up the courage to walk up to Winter. I wanted to talk to her. I missed her.\n\n\"Hello.\" I'd said.\n\nShe was startled by my sudden appearance behind her, so she jumped, looking at me with horrified eyes. But she didn't look scared, I couldn't quite figure it out back then.\n\n\"Hi?\" She answered. She couldn't remember me, which was okay. She didn't need to. I could remind her.\n\n\"You remember me? Kira?\" Her expression softened a little and her eyes grew wide.\n\n\"Kira?\" \"Kira!\" She said, jumping up and hugging me.\n\nWe spent the entire day in the park, just talking, and catching up. It was nice.\n\nWe made plans to meet again the next day, and we did. Summer was coming up, and we spent the entirety of it, together. That's the summer that I found out that I really loved her.\n\nBut fate had to separate us again. Her family moved away, and I didn't see her again for another 7 years. But fate and destiny have a strange way of playing with your feelings.\n\nI met her once more in college. We somehow ended up applying to and getting into the same college. It was awesome seeing her again, but it hurt so much seeing her with someone else. She had a boyfriend, Jackson.\n\nThat's where all my troubles began. I really, really wanted to be with her. And her boyfriend was such a fucking jackass, that sometimes I just wanted to kill him.\n\nOne night, while drunk at a bar, he provoked me.\n\n\"I know you have a crush on Winter.\" He'd said.\n\nMy heart was pounding, but I knew it wasn't that feeling of anxiety you get when you're caught in the act, caught doing or saying something embarrassing. No, this was something else. It came from the deepest pits of my conscience. It was anger. It was hate.\n\n\"You can't have her.\" He slurred at me in his drunken state. He was barely standing up on his own two feet.\n\n\"She's mine.\" He added. This was my blowing point. I wasn't really thinking straight. Anger and alcohol clouded my judgment. I do not remember what happened, I blacked out right after I threw the first swing at him. That's my last memory.\n\nI woke up in the hospital the next morning. A cast on my arm and leg. Winter was by my bedside. *My bedside.* Not that jerk's, but mine.\n\nLater I learned why. We fought. The security threw us outside, but we continued fighting. He got disoriented from taking a punch and walked out into traffic and got hit by a car, he died on impact.\n\nAll of my injuries were inflicted by him. Apparently, I was quite the punching bag. I was lucky I wasn't charged with any prison time or manslaughter. In fact, they wrote the entire thing off as an accident. I really thought I was screwed this time. But somehow I came out alive, out of prison. And now I had my dream girl.\n\nShe was everything that I could wish for, and we stayed together for 4 years, we moved in together during the 4th, and I proposed to her just at the beginning of last year, 2022.\n\nIt was such a magical moment. It was beautiful.\n\nWe've been living together ever since, planning our wedding, and it's supposed to be happening at the end of march. We're both so excited to tie the knot. To celebrate our engagement, my surrogate parents gifted us a german shepherd puppy. \"Time to learn how to take care of someone else in the house.\" They teased us. They clearly wanted a grandkid, but a kid wasn't something we had discussed yet.\n\nBut we did have that discussion eventually, about half a year ago.\n\n\"You know, I always wanted to have a kid.\" Winter had said. I bobbed my head to one side at looked at her, trying to study her, and figure out what she was thinking.\n\nShe looked back at me. Her eyes, too, were full of wonder. Full of endless possibilities.\n\n\"Do you smell that?\" I tried changing the topic, sniffing around. It really did smell bad, like something was rotting. I wondered where it came from.\n\n\"Smell what? Stop trying to change the topic.\" She scolded me.\n\n\"I just.. I never had real parents. And I always told myself that if I had a kid, I would make sure to be the best parent they could ever have.\" She said after a long moment of silence. I couldn't say I didn't understand her, I even related to her. At some point, my deranged and hurt mind thought the exact same thing. But I soon realized that it was wrong to think that way. I realized that I only wanted a kid just to win a bet against my kid self. Just to prove to myself that I can do better. And I realized that wasn't a good reason to have a kid.\n\n\"I don't want to have a kid just so we can prove a point to ourselves,\" I responded to her. Winter's eyes grew a little wide. I could tell she didn't expect that answer, maybe she expected that I would agree.\n\n\"Are you saying you don't want to have a kid with me?\" Her expression grew grim, it was like I had just told her that someone died.\n\n\"No, I'm saying I don't want to have a kid just to prove some point.\" And then I added, \"I do want to have a kid, just maybe not right now, not so soon.\"\n\nHer eyes were tearing up now. She was really taking this seriously.\n\n\"Winter, listen, I love you. I love you so so much. You are my world. And right now my love doesn't have enough space to fit in a third soul.\" I attempted to cheer her up. She loved when I told her that I loved her. But instead, she began crying.\n\n\"So you're saying that you love the dog more than you'd love our kid? The fucking dog? Really?\" She was trying to spit back fire.\n\nI just looked at her, wide-eyed.\n\n\"You know, just fuck you!\" She screamed at me. I couldn't really understand why she got so violent. Were kids such a touchy subject? Maybe I crossed a line.\n\n\"I'm sorry-\" I began trying to apologize, but she interrupted me. \"Fuck you and fuck your apologies!\" She was really crying now. Winter stood up and just left. I didn't try to follow, I just let her be. We didn't really talk for a while after that fight. But we made up eventually, and both agreed to have a child.\n\nOne night a couple of weeks ago, we got into a discussion about our roots. About our origins.\n\n\"You know it's weird how you have a Japanese name, but you don't look Asian, like at all, it makes me wonder, you know?\" She told me while sitting crosslegged on the couch. The dog was laying at my feet.\n\nI really hated thinking about it, because it made me think of my parents. Of who they were. It made me think of them like they were people, and to me, they were simply monsters.\n\n\"There's this ancestry test I found online, we send in our DNA samples, and they can tell us what kind of genes we have, where we come from, you know?\" Her marine blue eyes were lit up with excitement. She really wanted to do this.\n\n\"I don't know Winter, I don't know if I want to know.\" I really was conflicted with this. I was afraid that maybe somehow I'd be disappointed.\n\n\"Come on Kira, It'll be fun!\" She had her puppy eyes expression on, the same expression she used on me almost every Saturday to go out for dinner, and it always worked wonders.\n\nI took a deep breath and sighed. \"Fine.\"\n\nShe squealed. \"You're the best!\" Winter placed her head on my shoulder. It made me smile. I was happy that she was happy. That's all that mattered. The dog got up and went into another room after Winter scooted over to me.\n\nThis wasn't unusual. For some reason, that dog just didn't like Winter all that much. Maybe because Winter was always the bad cop and I was the good cop. While I gave the dog treats, Winter gave him loud lectures.\n\n\"So how do they work?\" I asked Winter.\n\nWe ordered those tests online the very same night, and thanks to amazon prime, they came the following evening.\n\nWe read the instructions and did the tests, and I mailed them out first thing in the morning while going off to work.\n\nWinter was all giddy and excited all week, she was like a kid waiting in line for the ice cream truck. I'll admit, her excitement was rubbing off on me too. And I found myself waiting for the results in anticipation as well.\n\nThey came in a couple of days ago. Winter ran into the living room, holding two envelopes in her hand, waving them around like some trophy, with a wide grin on her beautiful face.\n\n'We got them! We finally got them!\" She squealed like a little girl at a theme park. She handed me one of the two envelopes, it had my name and our address on it.\n\n\"Come on let's open them!\" She was all jumpy and giddy, it was really cute.\n\n\"Oh it says here that I am 7% french, maybe that's where my flirt comes from.\" She was reading her results out loud.\n\n\"I'm 83% American, 7% Russian, 6% Canadian, 3% Asian, 1% German.\" I just read mine out loud in a sequence.\n\n\"Special genes... It says here that I have the Monoamine oxidase A gene, short for MAOA.\" Winter said thoughtfully.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked her while looking at my own special gene section.\n\n\"I don't know it doesn't say..\" She replied thoughtfully.\n\n\"Mine says I don't have any special genes.\" I was kind of disappointed.\n\n\"I didn't even know these came with that, I just thought it told you your ancestry.\" She said, her eyes still glued on the piece of paper.\n\nI took out my phone. \"What was it called again? The M something?\"\n\n\"MAOA gene.\" Winter read it out for me. I put it into the search bar.\n\n\"It just says some random gibberish about it putting some sort of chemical or something into your body or brain or whatever?\" I was honestly not smart enough to understand this. I copied the full name of the gene, Monoamine oxidase A gene, and put it into the search bar. The same thing came up.\n\nI tried searching it up a bunch of other ways to see if anything else would show up, but all it said is that it was some sort of enzyme type of gene. I sighed in defeat.\n\n\"Can't find anything special about your special gene, at least not in terms that I can understand,\" I admitted, feeling defeated.\n\nWinter finally looked up from her piece of paper. She had a smug expression on her face. \"I got a special gene and you don't!\" She sang in a nursery rhyme type of tone, sticking her tongue out in the end like a five-year-old girl would. I just laughed. \"You're so childish sometimes.\"\n\nShe gave me the \"Screw you\" tongue.\n\nWe talked about our ancestry for a while, maybe my parents just liked the name Kira, and that's all there is to it. Thinking of them just left a sour taste in my mouth so I wanted to get this topic over with as soon as possible. But Winter's special gene still held my interest.\n\nAfter she went to bed I couldn't really sleep. I continued googling about it, going into different forums of people talking about it, of people who have it talking about it. Eventually, I discovered two different names for this *special gene*. The warrior gene, which sounded kind of cool and mighty, I'd love to think of my fiance as a warrior. But it's also known as the Serial Killer gene. Which made my blood freeze all over.\n\nWhat the hell did that mean? That sounded terrifying as hell. So I stayed up all night reading about it.\n\nI didn't even notice when Winter walked into the kitchen, yawning and rubbing her eyes. \"Didn't find you in bed today, you got up early?\" She asked in between yawns.\n\nFor some reason, I felt the urge to lie to her. I never had that urge before, but just this one time, I felt like telling her the truth was worse.\n\n\"Yeah I got up a little early, the dog woke me.\" I lied.\n\nWinter nodded and walked over to the coffee machine, turning it on. \"Haven't had your morning coffee yet?\" My heart dropped. I realized I got caught. I always have a coffee, that is literally the first thing I do in the morning. I was thinking of something to say, anything to get me out of this situation.\n\nShe just shrugged. \"Want me to brew you one as well then?\" Her back was facing me. \"Yeah,\" I muttered out meekly. What the fuck was going on with me, why was I acting so weird? Was I actually scared of her? Scared that she might be a killer? That's simply not possible, she's the sweetest girl I have ever known in my entire life.\n\nWinter placed the hot coffee mug in front of me and I almost jumped, startled out of my thoughts.\n\n\"Hey, are you okay? You look a little pale, there are bags under your eyes too.\" She had a concerned expression. I took a deep breath. This was the Winter that I always knew, the Winter that worried about me and cared about me and loved me.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine now.\" I smiled at her, trying to put on the most real smile that I could. But it felt fake on my lips. I've never felt a fake smile before.\n\nShe smiled back and nodded. \"Good.\"\n\nI got up from the chair, closing the laptop. \"I'll take the dog for the morning walk,\" I announced and Winter gave me a thumbs up, sipping on her coffee.\n\nI put on a leash on the dog, and we went outside, down to the trail leading up to the park where I saw Winter for the second time in my life. Where we talked for hours on end. It was a sweet memory.\n\nI also remembered her expression when I said hello. She didn't really look scared, she looked like she had been caught doing something, something she didn't want others to know.\n\nI tried to explore that memory, I tried to analyze the memory I had of her expression that day. But it just blanked out whenever I tried harder.\n\nWe finally got to the park, flowers were blooming again. I walked over to the exact same spot where I saw her. Trying to recall that memory, to replay it in my head.\n\nThere were daisies all around the park, but I remembered this spot specifically because while we were talking, an ant bit me. It itched like hell.\n\nLooking at it now, there's an ant's nest exactly where she would have stood many years ago, in this exact same park.\n\nI continued thinking about it. About what it could mean. I walked back home with the dog. Winter was no longer in the kitchen. I let the dog off the leash, and he walked off, probably trying to find a nice place to sleep in.\n\nI sat back down next to the table. I could see that my laptop was moved. I opened it up. The screen still looked the same, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I took a sigh of relief.\n\nThe silent house noises were making everything else louder, like my breathing for example. I could also hear the shower running upstairs.\n\nI wrote a note that I'd be going out and left the house. I just needed to get some fresh air, not including the dog. I got into the car and just drove, I didn't really have any destination in mind, just wherever the wind would take me. And it took me to a police station. I don't know why my instincts drove me here, but I had an inkling to go inside. I had to make sure of something. I had to confirm.\n\nI walked inside the police station and asked to speak about a case, the accident Jackson and I were in, where he walked out into open traffic and died on impact.\n\n\"Yes, I can pull up the case files, since it's a cold case, but I'm going to need to see some ID.\"\n\nI handed the lady my ID card. She looked at it, and then at her screen. \"You were one of the people on the scene..\" She said thoughtfully. \"One of two.\"\n\n\"Two?\" I asked her, confused. It was a bar fight, or well I guess just outside of a bar fight, why were there only two witnesses?\n\n\"You were too far gone to make a witness statement, and Jackson died during the exchange, so the third present witness made a statement.\"\n\n\"She said you thought, and that Jackson, while trying to throw a punch at you, stumbled over into open traffic while a car was speeding by, and died on impact. It was ruled an accident.\"\n\nWhile this does sound similar to what she told me, what she told me made it sound like it was my fault, made it sound like I had done it. I always had to live with that guilt. But to the police, she said that he did that to himself.\n\nThis was making no sense. What does Winter gain by lying to either of us?\n\nUnless.. she lied to both of us.. My eyes grew wide.\n\n\"Sir, are you okay?\" I turned around and began walking away. \"Sir?\" She asked again, in a more concerned voice. I left the building and got back into my car, my breaths were heavy and rapid.\n\nI needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nWhile we lived in a big enough city, there were a couple of missing people cases in our local area. Mainly single men. They were also reported to be abusive. None of their bodies were ever found. There was a pattern, but with no evidence of a crime, no proper investigation besides a missing person's case was launched, and quite frankly nobody cared about men that abused other women.\n\nI tried to set a timeline for the disappearings. I had a suspicion. A really bad one. I was praying I was wrong. I was praying that once I got home and told my fiance about it, we could both just laugh it off.\n\nThere were six missing men over the course of a year, the first case happened about a month after we moved in together.\n\nI continued digging, the next was two months later, and the next another two months. There was always a delay of a month to two between each disappearance. Almost every disappearance began with them going out for drinks in local bars, but none of the disappearances shared the same one.\n\nBut I found a single anomaly. The third disappearance happened around the time when I was out of town, visiting my adoptive family for the holidays. My fiance stayed behind. It was the only time when I could remember not being in town. We had our fight after I got back. Our fight about the baby.\n\nI remember that strange, god-awful smell in our bedroom. It smelled like rot. She dismissed it. I remember the next day the smell was gone. My heart was pounding. *Is she really..?*\n\nMy phone rang, which startled me. It was Winter. I had to stay calm. I had to sound normal. I needed to know the truth, I needed to know. But not over the phone.\n\n\"Hey honey, where are you? You left without saying a word, that's not like you.\" She sounded worried.\n\n\"Oh uh..\" My hands were sweating. I never was a good liar.\n\n\"I just wanted to get some fresh air,\" I said.\n\nThere was silence on the other end.\n\n\"I'll be back home soon,\" I said.\n\n\"Good.\" I could hear her let out a sigh of relief. \"I have some good news for you once you do.\" Her voice sounded cryptic, and mysterious. I wondered what it could be. I momentarily forgot everything that I had just discovered.\n\n\"Okay,\" I replied.\n\n\"I love you.\" She said.\n\n\"I love you too,\" I said back. But I wasn't sure if I meant it anymore.\n\nI drove home in silence. Lost in thought. I had a million different scenarios running through my head, of how this conversation could start, go, and end. I didn't like a single one of them. I prayed that I was wrong. I didn't believe in god, but for the first time in my life, I begged god for me to be wrong.\n\nI parked in our driveway and headed inside. It was quiet. \"I'm in the living room!\" I heard my fiance yell out. As soon as I entered the kitchen there was this god-awful smell wafting through the entire house. it smelled like a dead animal. The smell made me gag.\n\nI slowly walked into the living room, my guard up. My wife was sitting on the couch, cross-legged. She looked at me with a warm smile.\n\n\"You're back.\" She whispered, it sounding bittersweet. I never heard her speak that way. I hated that bittersweet voice of hers.\n\n\"I am,\" I replied. Not moving from the doorway.\n\n\"Aren't you going to sit?\" She asked, leaving a hint of hurt in her question and expression.\n\nI just looked at her. I didn't know how to respond. I was frozen in place, standing in the doorway.\n\nThis god-awful smell still invaded my nostrils. I was trying my best not to gag, especially not in front of her, not now.\n\n\"What is that smell?\" I avoided her question.\n\n\"What smell?\" She smiled back at me.\n\nI looked at her for a long moment. She looked at me. I couldn't figure out what she was seeing. But her eyes were sad. \"I have some good news.\" She finally said.\n\n\"Yeah?\" I wondered what she could say right now.\n\n\"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nMy ears began ringing. I was frozen in place.\n\n\"I'm pregnant.\" Her voice tumbled around in my head. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Kira?\" She asked.\n\n\"Aren't you happy?\" She sounded hurt.\n\n\"I am,\" I said under my breath.\n\n\"Aren't you going to hug me?\"\n\nShe stood up then. I couldn't get the smell out of my head. What was this goddamn smell?\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. She walked up to me. I was an entire head taller than she was. She looked up at me. The same bittersweet expression she had on her face as when I walked into the room. And then she put her arms around me. Her head was on my chest. And suddenly the world slowed down.\n\nI forgot all of my worries. I forgot about the smell, I forgot about my concerns. I forgot about her bittersweet expression. All I could think was that I loved her.\n\n\"I have some bad news too.\" She said, and that brought me back to reality. My heart was pounding. My eyes noticed a blotch of red on the back of her grey socks. My eyes grew wide. I began trembling.\n\nSomething sharp poked me on my back.\n\n\"You won't see your child grow up.\" She whispered right into my ear.\n\nI felt as if something sharp stabbed me in the back. She kept holding me, her grip grew tighter. I could feel something wet dripping on my hands. I realized it was her tears.\n\n\"Why did you have to go and do this? Why couldn't you just ignore it?\" She was crying, she was sobbing.\n\nEverything sounded muffled like I was underwater. The stab didn't really hurt anymore, but it felt itchy. I had the urge to try and itch the spot. But my hands were unmoving. They were trembling.\n\nMy fiance let go of me, and I collapsed onto my knees. I could see her pained expression through my teary eyes.\n\nI could see her say something to me, but I didn't hear it, I could no longer hear anything but the loud ringing. And all I could smell was that distressing smell.\n\nThen everything went dark.\n\nI awoke sometime later, everything was dark. My entire body was in intense pain. I couldn't really move. It took some time for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I realized I was still in the living room.\n\nI used my hands to feel around my body. Everything hurt, but everything was also numb, I couldn't tell what hurt just by the pain alone. I found the knife, still stuck, wedged in my back.\n\nBy some miracle, I had survived. I somehow managed to pull out my phone from my pocket and dialed 911. They answered, but I couldn't speak. I had no more strength to speak. Then I blacked out again.\n\nThe next time I woke up was in a hospital.\n\nI was alive. Luckily, the knife didn't hit any vitals. And even luckier, my attacker didn't take out the knife. I survived because the knife stayed in my body. It slowed down the rate at which I was bleeding out by exponential amounts. I barely lost any blood. I was lucky, they said.\n\nBut I know I wasn't. I know she chose to let me live. She's a serial killer. She's not sloppy enough to make such rookie mistakes, even if it's her fiance she has to silence.\n\nI told the police everything, from what I discovered during the ancestry test, to what I managed to figure out by connecting the dots. They didn't sound convinced about all of my crazy theories, about her being a serial killer, killing all those abusive men. But they did believe that she was the one who stabbed me. And she disappeared right after.\n\nThey also found my dog dead in the house. That was where the smell was coming from.\n\nAs I write this, I'm still in the hospital, trying to recover.\n\nThey haven't been able to find any trace of her yet.\n\nJackson's case was reopened as a murder investigation, and she's the main suspect. All of the missing men's cases have been reopened too.\n\nA dumb ancestry test turned my life a full 360, I was supposed to be getting married this march. Now I'll be spending that night in therapy. I really wish I had been wrong about this. A part of me wishes that I did ignore it; then we could've both lived happy lives. Raised a happy child.\n\nIf you ever do an ancestry test, just pray that none of you have the serial killer [gene.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)",

As more of me starts to become goo, i question myself: \"What did i do wrong?\". I did not come from a good family, i spent half of my life in a bad part of town, i was exposed to the world too soon, and i strangely got attached to it: the diversities, the bad things, the unknown, i started to like it. It's no surprise that as soon as i knew of the \"organization\", my fate was sealed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI witnessed the horrors, the eldritch beasts that one day will take my life, i got to know of the shared mind, the project to keep humanity living forever, under the form of slices of the job of everyone here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am Mark Hellenmen, memory number 1304, i take care of feeding the things here.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fg7du/my_ring_camera_shows_our_new_neighbors_as/",
        "text": "It wasn’t common to get new neighbors in my small town, so I was incredibly surprised when the vacant house next door finally was bought.\n\nThe house had always been labeled as haunted so I kept to myself and didn’t bother greeting my new neighbors. I would occasionally spy on them just because I’d at least like to know their faces if they plan on living here at all even if it’s a short while.\n\nThey looked like a loving couple, and they seemed nice enough.\n\nA day later I heard someone ringing my doorbell. Now I don’t usually like people and my doorbell has a camera that connects directly to my phone so I unlocked my phone and checked to see who it was.\n\nI almost went into shock after seeing what was at my door. It looked like a monster that shouldn’t even exist in this world.\n\nMouths where ears and a nose would be and teeth were on top of their eyelids. It looked like something that has only one purpose in life and it was consuming flesh.\n\nThe creature next to it was just as hideous with tentacles covering where a mouth should be. The creature didn’t even have real eyes just two glowing red dots in its place.\n\nLike I said before I’m not a people person but a monster person this I had to see, but to my dismay when I opened the door it was just my neighbors with their fake smiles.\n\nThey introduce themselves as Azarias and Helias. Odd names that didn’t fit in this town but who cares they were standing in the places of the two monsters I just saw.\n\nI introduced myself as their neighbor nothing more nothing less. They didn’t seem to read the mood I was setting because they didn’t leave nor did they seem the slightest bit uncomfortable. They just said, “Greetings neighbor, we suspect to talk a lot more in the future”.  They proceeded to turn around without another word.\n\nThese were weird people I did not like their aura one bit. I then immediately turned my attention back to my doorbell. I decided to ring the doorbell which immediately gave me a notification on my phone. I checked my camera live and yeah.  It was just me standing there no monsters at all.\n\nAt this point, I decided I needed more sun or something because hallucinating is never a good sign when you aren’t high.\n\nI went inside and opened the window in my bedroom and opened a couple of curtains around the house. “That should be enough sun and air for today”. Hmmm talking to myself maybe I should get a pet or something being alone all the time has been eating at me.\n\nThere’s a shelter near the town so the first thing I did was head that way. Animals without a home need some love so I adopted a 4-year-old cat.  I named her Hope as a sign that there’s always a chance to be loved. I got her all the essentials a cat needs according to the internet and I got her a cute cat bed.  She was a little hesitant at first so I gave her space, let her explore at her own pace, and tried my best not to touch her too much.  She seemed to warm up to her new home and I was incredibly grateful for that. \n\nNow the day is fresh so I decided to do some spying on the neighbors.\n\nThey kept all their curtains closed and it appeared that all the lights were off too. As normal as that was for me that was not something normal for the people around this town or people that just moved here. Usually, the first few days of moving in would be organizing the home. Not sitting in the dark.\n\nI thought about knocking on their door but the house just gives off death and fear. I don’t why anyone would ever buy the house.\n\nI did the next best thing I could. I went home and played with Hope and continued to build a good relationship with her.\n\nThe next day I woke up to Hope hissing like crazy at the door. I got up to check on her when immediately I heard the doorbell. I quickly check my phone and again the two monsters from the first time were there but this time they weren’t just standing there. They were facing the camera acknowledging its presence. \n\nThis was way more terrifying than before especially since Hope was freaking out. I ignore people at my door all the time so why not ignore monsters at my door?\n\nThat’s when I heard a loud banging on the door. It’s easy to ignore ringing but that knocking sounded like they were going to tear the door down. I quickly grabbed a knife and decided against my better judgment.\n\nAs I approached the door my adrenaline was spiking. I could feel a murderous aura coming from the door as the loud bangs continued to ring throughout the house.\n\nI held my breath and…. “Hello, neighbor we hope you weren’t sleeping” Helias smiled as the words slithered out of her mouth. “What do you want” I stated back making sure to emphasize the anger in my voice.\n\nI could hear Hope start to growl behind me and at that very moment, I saw both of their eyes dart straight through me at Hope at the exact same time. I could see the murder in their cold empty eyes so I quickly stepped outside and closed the door.\n\nTheir eyes were still Fixated on Hope through the door so I asked again. “What do you want”? That got their attention and in a moment Azarias handed me an envelope and stated, “You’re invited to our home to celebrate our moving in”. I took the envelope and immediately signaled for them to leave.\n\nAgain it would appear they were incredibly bad at picking up social cues so I made it more obvious “Is that all”.  Helias smiled and said, “Yes that is all for now, and feel free to invite your pet over as well”.\n\nThey turned around and headed straight back to their creepy house.\n\nI also turned around and entered my house\n\nI immediately checked on Hope. She seemed fine now that the neighbors were gone. Hope didn’t really let me touch her though, especially while I was holding the envelope. So I went back to my room and headed towards my window I decided that I am not hallucinating something weird is going on. As I approached my window to close it I could see both of them staring at me from inside their home making eye contact with me. That made me close the curtains faster than usual.\n\nI wonder if they have been hacking my camera and messing with me all this time there’s no way something this creepy is real.\n\nI opened the envelope and it was just the standard invitation except a little childish like a birthday invitation you get in elementary. I threw away the envelope.\n\nShould I really go to a potential monster party? I pondered to myself, I wonder if my other neighbors will be going to this event.\n\nI might not have much to live for but I have just enough to not want to be sacrificed at a possible potential ritual.\n\nI’ll just wait and see what happens to my other neighbors.",

        "text": " I might be a drunk, but sure as hell, I ain’t a god damn liar.\n\nJackson’s always been a few trees short of a forest, but he’d been acting damned shady the last few weeks. I’d spy him through my curtains, loafing around his yard for hours, staring at the ground, muttering to himself, pacing and turning to and fro. That kind of erratic movement that makes you all *uneasy*.\n\nLike I said, he’s always been a bit touched, but I was really starting to think he might’ve lost it, a shame too ‘cause he was always good for a few drinks, every once in a while anyway.\n\nI was getting quite worried about him and I didn’t want to see him carted off, so, I did my neighbourly due diligence, I checked up on the guy. When he opened the front door I knew the poor fella had clocked off. It happens to the best of us I’m afraid.\n\nHe opened the door, socks and a t-shirt, cock and balls hanging out, clear as daylight, and exclaimed “Good evening neighbour!”\n\nI was ushering him inside, out of sight from the street, ready to assess the severity of the situation, when I noticed a translucent sluglet shimmying into his ear canal.\n\nStrange.\n\nI meant to stop it and was reaching out, but the little fucker sunk itself in deep before I even raised my hand. I didn’t fancy playing tug of war inside his cavities, so I let off a little shudder and pressed on.\n\n“Jesus” I said, unable to stop myself. His house had gone to shit. \n\n“You sit here Jackson, let me get you something, some water, you look a little peaky.” I pulled out a chair from underneath the dining table\n\nI’m not one to judge on cleanliness, but the state of his living-room-kitchenette was insane, I mean, there were literal *mounds of dirt*, all over the room. He had clearly forgone traditional notions of etiquette; the fridge was open and empty and all the food had been moved to the table, just rotting in a pile.\n\n“So how have you been?” I asked him, mostly as a joke to myself while I tried to find him a clean glass.\n\n“Yes. Jackson has been acceptable. Thank you.” He replied, and then as an afterthought added my name, “Marco.”\n\nTwo glasses in hand, I went to the sink and twisted the faucet, and found it was coated in a slimy residue.\n\n“Eugh!”, Jackson you should really think about cleaning this place up. It’s gotten a little unruly, don’t you think?” I filled him a glass, but decided to forgo my own, I’d spied a couple cans in the cupboard and cracked one of them open. It was warm, but I’d take a tepid brew over slimy tap water any day of the week. \n\n“I find the conditions in here quite acceptable” He said as I passed him the glass, and then added “But thank you, Marco, for your suggestion and the water. Water is nourishing.”\n\nI took a hefty glug from the can and was just starting to wonder if I *really* should call the nuthouse on him, when I saw the second one.\n\nA big, juicy almond coloured one. Crawling up and struggling around his neck. Then I spied a third, crawling from his hand and onto the table, then slipping away to nestle itself in the rotting food.\n\nI couldn’t hold it in this time. “God, Jackson - what the fuck is going on with these slugs? What, are you growing crops in here or something? Jesus!” It was revolting.\n\nI reached over to him, wanting to pluck the slug from his neck and toss it outside, but his arm snapped out to mine, catching me by the wrist, mid-air. I wasn’t expecting him to move so fast. His hand was cold and clammy.\n\n“This is bad behaviour, Marco. Sit down and finish your beer. There’s another on the table, if you find it satisfying” said Jackson, the slug had moved out of my reach and retreated out of sight. Jackson released my hand, and standing up, began walking over to the kitchen to make himself busy, bare ass bouncing side to side. \n\n“Uh, sure. If you insist.” I replied. “Listen, why don’t I go and get you some trousers man?” Mostly I just wanted to get out from the dirty kitchenette, but I was still worried for the guy.\n\nCrushing the can, I placed it next to a bowl of uncooked egg whites and yellows and let off another little shudder. I opened the second drink, and began to walk upstairs.\n\nHonestly the whole house was in a real way. In places, I could see half-assed attempts at redecoration. Floorboards had been stripped from the ground, revealing the earth, and muck and piping. Doors had been taken off their hinges and left laying on their sides next to the open frames. The carpet on the stairs was moist, and there were those random piles of dirt everywhere. I *really* did have to call someone.\n\nI made it to his top of the stairs and found that he’d left the water running in his shower and sink. They were gently overflowing, running water over the carpet and wood. At least I knew why it was so moist now. I grabbed the first pair of trousers I could find and hurried back down the stairs, splish-sploshing as I went. Jackson had well and truly lost it.\n\nI called out to him as I turned the corner into the kitchen-living-dining room, “Hey, I got you som-“ and was rendered speechless by what I saw.\n\nIn front of the sink, staring up at the ceiling, hands in the air, Jackson was stood. Crushing raw eggs above his greedily expectant face, shovelling the shells into his open mouth and spitting out the gooey-egg-fluid.\n\n“Jackson, I-“ Stepping backwards, I put my foot into one of the bigger piles of dirt and, in my surprise, yelled some strange yelping cry like “Uhyeeouugh!!”. I slipped on the dirt, my beer can went flying, and I did, what must have looked like, an attempt some strange gymnastic pose.\n\nAs I was falling I kicked out my leg and sent the large dirt pile scattering across the room.\n\nAnd with that dirt pile.\n\nSlugs.\n\nHundreds of tiny little, translucent, fucking sluglets, cascading with the dirt, all the way across the room.\n\nThat really upset Jackson. I mean he was pissed. \n\nHe stormed over to be, swinging everything, and grabbed me by my shirt. He lifted me up and off of the floor, and placed me and my feet back down on the ground.\n\n“No. This is bad. This is not acceptable. M-m-Ma-Marco!” He was fuming, and trying to talk to me through what sounded like a mouth full of eggshells. But it wasn’t angry like how you or I might be if someone started sending shit flying all across our living-room-kitchenette. He seemed genuinely sad, disappointed, like a school teacher or something.\n\nAnd, right there, and I will swear this on my mother, to the court and to fucking Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour up above. Right in that moment, inside of his mouth.\n\nHundreds upon hundreds of miniature sluglets. Feasting on broken, gooey egg shells.\n\n“Uhh-huh, yeah uh, sure Jackson” I said, backing away from him and looking for the front door latch with my hands.\n\n“You get out of here! Jackson doesn’t want you here anymore!” He said to me, visibly upset, on the brink of tears even.\n\n“I’m *really* trying buddy!” And Hallelujah! I felt the little knob, twisted it and got the fuck outta there before I had to witness any other nightmares. It was stepping outside, into the daylight and the fresh air, that I realised how musty, and cold, and damp it had been in there.\n\nI went back in my house and locked the doors, cracked open another brew and went right back to spying out of my window.\n\nJackson surely had been touched, lost his god damn mind even. But there was something more going on, I knew that for certain.",

        "text": "Our history is quite long before we actually got together, and eventually got engaged. I met her at an orphanage. She was this sweet, shy but really pretty girl, and I was this dorky, socially awkward clown that tried to make everyone laugh. For me it was love at first sight. \n\nMaking her laugh made my entire day during those times. And seeing her cry would trigger emotions I never quite understood. It made me want to hurt whatever, or whoever was upsetting Winter. Yes, her name was Winter. Mine was Kira. Which was strange because I did not look Japanese at all, yet my birth certificate had Kira written on it. \n\nMy birth parents abandoned me when I was 2, I don't remember much about them really, sometimes I can see their very blurry faces, with no expressions. I don't like thinking about them. They left me so they don't deserve to live rent-free in my head. \n\nIt was similar with Winter, she too was basically left at a door step of an orphanage, except the difference was, there was no record of her birth, no record of her existence, she had no name. \n\nSo the orphanage gave her one, they called her Winter, because she blessed the orphanage with her presence during the christmas holidays. \n\nEventually though we were seperated, I was adopted into one family, while she into another. I didn't see her for over five years, until one fateful day, while walking home from school with some buddies, I spotted her. In the park, kneeling over some flowers. I instantly knew it was her. \n\nI excused myself from my friends and built up the courage to walk up to Winter. I wanted to talk to her. I missed her. \n\n\"Hello.\" I'd said. \n\nShe was startled by my sudden appearance behind her, so she jumped, looking at me with horrified eyes. But she didn't really look scared, I couldn't quite figure it out back then. \n\n\"Hi?\" She answered. She couldn't remember me, which was okay. She didn't need to. I could remind her.\n\n\"You remember me? Kira?\" Her expression softened a little and her eyes grew wide.\n\n\"Kira?\" \"Kira!\" She said, jumping up and hugging me. \n\nWe spent the entire day in the park, just talking, catching up. It was really nice. \n\nWe made plans to meet again the next day, and we did. Summer was coming up, and we spent the entirety of it, together. That's the summer that I found out that I really loved her. \n\nBut fate had to seperate us again. Her family moved away, and I didn't see her again for another 7 years. But fate and destiny have a strange way of playing with your feelings. \n\nI met her once more in college. We somehow ended up applying to, and getting into the exact same college. It was awesome seeing her again, but it hurt so much seeing her with someone else. She had a boyfriend, Jackson. \n\nThat's where all my troubles began. I really, really wanted to be with her. And her boyfriend was such a fucking jack ass, that sometimes I just wanted to kill him. \n\nOne night, while drunk at a bar, he provoked me. \n\n\"I know you have a crush on Winter.\" He'd said. \n\nMy heart was pounding, but I knew it wasn't that feeling of anxiety you get when you're caught in the act, caught doing or saying something embarassing. No, this was something else. It came from the deepest pits of my conscience. It was anger. It was hate. \n\n\"You can't have her.\" He slurred at me in his drunken state. He was barely standing up on his own two feet. \n\n\"She's mine.\" He added. This was my blowing point. I wasn't really thinking straight. Anger and alchohol clouded my judgement. I do not remember what happened, I blacked out right after I threw the first swing at him. That's my last memory. \n\nI woke up in the hospital the next morning. A cast on my arm and leg. Winter was by my bed side. *My bed side.* Not that jerk's, but mine. \n\nLater I learned why. We fought. The security threw us outside, but we continued fighting. He got disoriented from taking a punch and walked out into traffic and got hit by a car, he died on impact. \n\nAll of my injuries were inflicted by him. Apparently I was quite the punching bag. I was lucky I wasn't charged with any prison time or man slaughter. In fact they wrote the entire thing off as an accident. I really thought I was screwed this time. But somehow I came out alive, out of prison. And now I had my dream girl. \n\nShe was everything that I could wish for, and we stayed together for 4 years, we moved in together during the 4th, and I proposed to her just at the beginning of last year, 2022. \n\nIt was such a magical moment. It was beautiful. \n\nWe've been living together ever since, planning our wedding, and it's supposed to be happening at the  end of march. We're both so excited to tie the knot. To celebrate our engagement, my surrogate parents gifted us a german shephard puppy. \"Time to learn how to take care of someone else in the house.\" They teased us. They clearly wanted a grandkid, but a kid wasn't something we had discussed yet. \n\nBut we did have that discussion eventually, about half a year ago. \n\n\"You know, I always wanted to have a kid.\" Winter had said. I bobbed my head to one side at looked at her, trying to study her, figure out what she's thinking. \n\nShe looked back at me. Her eyes, too, were full of wonder. Full of endless possibilities. \n\n\"Do you smell that?\" I tried changing the topic, sniffing around. It really did smell bad, like something was rotting. I wondered where it came from. \n\n\"Smell what? Stop trying to change the topic.\" She scolded me. \n\n\"I just.. I never had real parents. And I always told myself that if I had a kid, I would make sure to be the best parent they could ever have.\" She said after a long moment of silence. I couldn't say I didn't understand her, I even related to her. At some point, my deranged and hurt mind thought the exact same thing. But I soon realised that it was wrong to think that way. I realised that I only wanted a kid just to win a bet against my kid self. Just to prove to myself that I can do better. And I realised that wasn't a good reason to have a kid. \n\n\"I don't want to have a kid just so we can prove a point to ourselves.\" I responded to her. Winter's eyes grew a little wide. I could tell she didn't expect that answer, maybe she expected that I would agree? \n\n\"Are you saying you don't want to have a kid with me?\" Her expression grew grim, it was like I had just told her that someone died. \n\n\"No, I'm saying I don't want to have a kid just to prove some point.\" And then I added, \"I do want to have a kid, just maybe not right now, not so soon.\"\n\nHer eyes were tearing up now. She was really taking this seriously.\n\n\"Winter listen, I love you. I love you so so much. You are my world. And right now my love doesn't have enough space to fit in a third soul.\" I attempted to cheer her up. She loved when I told her that I loved her. But instead she began crying.\n\n\"So you're saying that you love the dog more than you'd love our kid? The fucking dog? Really?\" She was trying to spit back fire. \n\nI just looked at her, wide eyed. \n\n\"You know, just fuck you!\" She screamed at me. I couldn't really understand why she got so violent. Were kids such a touchy subject? Maybe I crossed a line. \n\n\"I'm sorry-\" I began trying to apologise, but she interrupted me. \"Fuck you and fuck your apologies!\" She was really crying now. Winter stood up and just left. I didn't try to follow, I just let her be. We didn't really talk for a while after that fight. But we made up eventually, and both agreed to have a child.  \n\nOne night a couple weeks ago, we got into a discussion about our roots. About our origins. \n\n\"You know it's weird how you have a Japanese name, but you don't look asian, like at all, it makes me wonder, you know?\" She told me while sitting crosslegged on the couch. The dog was laying at my feet. \n\nI really hated thinking about it, because it made me think of my parents. Of who they were. It made me think of them of like they were people, and to me, they were simply monsters. \n\n\"There's this ancestry test I found online, we send in our dna samples, and they can tell us what kind of genes we have, where we come from, you know?\" Her marine blue eyes were lit up with excitement. She really wanted to do this. \n\n\"I don't know Winter, I don't know if I want to know.\" I really was conflicted with this. I was afraid that maybe somehow I'd be disappointed. \n\n\"Come on Kira, It'll be fun!\" She had her puppy eyes expression on, the same expression she used on me almost every saturday to go out for dinner, and it always worked wonders. \n\nI took a deep breath and sighed. \"Fine.\"\n\nShe squeeled. \"You're the best!\" Winter placed her head on my shoulder. It made me smile. I was happy that she was happy. That's all that mattered. The dog got up and went into another room after Winter scooted over to me. \n\nThis wasn't unusual. For some reason that dog just didn't like Winter all that much. Maybe because Winter was always the bad cop and I was the good cop. While I gave the dog treats, Winter gave him loud lectures. \n\n\"So how do they work?\" I asked Winter. \n\nWe ordered those tests online the very same night, and thanks to amazon prime, they came the following evening. \n\nWe read the instructions and did the tests, and I mailed them out first thing in the morning while going off to work. \n\nWinter was all giddy and excited all week, she was like a kid waiting in line for the ice cream truck. I'll admit, her excitement was rubbing off on me too. And I found myself waiting for the results in anticipation as well. \n\nThey came in a couple days ago. Winter ran into the living room, holding two envelopes in her hand, waving them around like some trophy, with a wide grin on her beautiful face. \n\n'We got them! We finally got them!\" She squeeled like a little girl at a theme park. She handed me one of the two envelopes, it had my name and our address on it. \n\n\"Come on let's open them!\" She was all jumpy and giddy, it was really cute. \n\n\"Oh it says here that I am 7% french, maybe that's where my flirt comes from.\" She was reading her results out loud. \n\n\"I'm 83% American, 7% Russian, 6% Canadian, 3% Asian, 1% German.\" I just read mine out loud in a sequence. \n\n\"Special genes... It says here that I have the Monoamine oxidase A gene, or short for MAOA.\" Winter said thoughtfully.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked her, while looking at my own special gene section.\n\n\"I don't know it doesn't say..\" She replied thoughtfully. \n\n\"Mine says I don't have any special genes.\" I was kind of disappointed.\n\n\"I didn't even know these came with that, I just thought it told you your ancestry.\"  She said, her eyes still glued on the piece of paper. \n\nI took out my phone. \"What was it called again? The M something?\" \n\n\"MAOA gene.\" Winter read it out for me. I put it into the search bar.\n\n\"It just says some random gibberish about it putting some sort of chemical or something into your body or brain or whatever?\" I was honestly not smart enough to understand this. I copied the full name of the gene, Monoamine oxidase A gene, and put it into the search bar. The same thing came up. \n\nI tried searching it up a bunch of other ways to see if anything else would show up, but all it said is that it was some sort of enzyme type of gene. I sighed in defeat.\n\n\"Can't find anything special about your special gene, at least not in terms that I can understand.\" I admitted, feeling defeated. \n\nWinter finally looked up from her piece of paper. She had a smug expression on her face. \"I got a special gene and you don't!\" She singed in a nursery rhyme type of tone, sticking her tongue out in the end like a five year old girl would. I just laughed. \"You're so childish sometimes.\" \n\nShe gave me the \"Screw you\" tongue. \n\nWe talked about our ancestry for a while, maybe my parents just liked the name Kira, and that's all there is to it. Thinking of them just left a sour taste in my mouth so I wanted to get this topic over with as soon as possible. But Winter's special gene still held my interest. \n\nAfter she went to bed I couldn't really sleep. I continued googling about it, going into different forums of people talking about it, of people who have it talking about it. Eventually I discovered two different names for this *special gene*. The warrior gene, which sounded kind of cool and mighty, I'd love to think of my fiance as a warrior. But it's also known as the Serial Killer gene. Which made my blood freeze all over. \n\nWhat the hell did that mean? That sounded terrifying as hell. So I stayed up all night reading about it. \n\nI didn't even notice when Winter walked into the kitchen, yawning and rubbing her eyes. \"Didn't find you in bed today, you got up early?\" She asked in between yawns. \n\nFor some reason I felt the urge to lie to her. I never had that urge before, but just this one time, I felt like telling her the truth was worse. \n\n\"Yeah I got up a little early, the dog woke me.\" I lied. \n\nWinter nodded and walked over to the coffee machine, turning it on. \"Haven't had your morning coffee yet?\" My heart dropped. I realised I got caught. I always have a coffee, that is literally the first thing I do in the morning. I was thinking of something to say, anything to get me out of this situation. \n\nShe just shrugged. \"Want me to brew you one as well then?\" Her back was facing to me. \"Yeah.\" I muttered out meakly. What the fuck was going on with me, why was I acting so weird? Was I actually scared of her? Scared that she might be a killer? That's simply not possible, she's the sweetest girl I have ever known in my entire life. \n\nWinter placed the hot coffee mug in front of me and I almost jumped, startled out of my thoughts. \n\n\"Hey, are you okay? You look a little pale, there's bags under your eyes too.\" She had a concerned expression. I took a deep breath. This was the Winter that I always knew, the Winter that worried about me and cared about me and loved me. \n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine now.\" I smiled at her, trying to put on the realest smile that I could. But it felt fake on my lips. I've never felt a fake smile before. \n\nShe smiled back and nodded. \"Good.\" \n\nI got up from the chair, closing the laptop. \"I'll take the dog for the morning walk.\" I announced and Winter gave me a thumbs up, sipping on her coffee. \n\n I put on a leash on the dog, and we went outside, down to the trail leading up to the park where I saw Winter for the second time in my life. Where we talked for hours on end. It was a sweet memory. \n\nI also remembered her expression when I said hello. She didn't really look scared, she looked like she had been caught doing something, something she didn't want others to know.\n\nI tried to explore that memory, I tried to analyze the memory I had of her expression that day. But it just blanked out whenever I tried harder. \n\nWe finally got to the park, flowers were blooming again. I walked over to the exact same spot where I saw here. Trying to recall that memory, to replay it in my head. \n\nThere were daisies all around the park, but I remembered this spot specifically because while we were talking, an ant bit me. It itched like hell. \n\nLooking at it now, there's an ant's nest exactly where she would have stood many years ago, in this exact same park. \n\nI continued thinking about it. About what it could mean. I walked back home with the dog. Winter was no longer in the kitchen. I let the dog off the leash, and he walked off, probably trying to find a nice place to sleep in. \n\nI sat back down next to the table. I could see that my laptop was moved. I opened it up. The screen still looked the same, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I took a sigh of relief. \n\nThe silent house noises were making everything else louder, like my breathing for example. I could also hear the shower running upstairs. \n\nI wrote a note that I'd be going out and left the house. I just needed to get some fresh air, not including the dog. I got into the car and just drove, I didn't really have any destination in mind, just wherever the wind would take me. And it took me to a police station. I don't know why my instincts drove me here, but I had an inkling to go inside. I had to make sure of something. I had to confirm. \n\nI walked inside the police station and asked to speak about a case, the accident Jackson and me were in, where he walked out into open traffic and died on impact. \n\n\"Yes, I can pull up the case files, since it's a cold case, but I'm going to need to see some ID.\" \n\nI handed the lady my ID card. She looked at it, and then at her screen. \"You were one of the people on scene..\" She said thoughtfully. \"One of two.\" \n\n\"Two?\" I asked her, confused. It was a bar fight, or well I guess just out of bar fight, why were there only two witnesses?\n\n\"You were too far gone to make a witness statement, and Jackson died during the exchange, so the third present witness made a statement.\" \n\n\"She said you thought, and that jackson, while trying to throw a punch at you, stumbled over into open traffic while a car was speeding by, and died on impact. It was ruled an accident.\" \n\nWhile this does sound similar to what she told me, what she told me made it sound like it was my fault, made it sound like I had done it. I always had to live with that guilt. But to the police, she said that he did that to himself? \n\nThis was making no sense. What does Winter gain by lying to either of us?\n\nUnless.. she lied to both of us.. My eyes grew wide.\n\n\"Sir, are you okay?\" I turned around and began walking away. \"Sir?\" She asked again, in a more concerned voice. I left the building and got back into my car, my breaths were heavy and rapid. \n\nI needed to get to the bottom of this. \n\nWhile we lived in a big enough city, there were a couple of missing people cases in our local area. Mainly single men. They all were also reported to be abusive. None of their bodies were ever found. There was a pattern, but with no evidence of a crime, no proper investigation besides a missing person's case was launched, and quite frankly nobody cared about men that abused other women.\n\nI tried to set a timeline of the disappearings. I had a suspicion. A really bad one. I was praying I was wrong. I was praying that once I got home and told my fiance about it, we could both just laugh it off. \n\nThere were six missing men over the course of a year, the first case happened about a month after we moved in together. \n\nI continued digging, the next was two months later, and the next another two months. There was always a delay of a month to two between each disappearance. Almost every disappearance began with them going out for drinks in local bars, but none of the disappearances shared the same one. \n\nBut I found a single anomaly. The third disappearance, It happened around the time when I was out of  town, visiting my adoptive family for the holidays. My fiance stayed behind. It was the only time when I could remember not being in town. We had our fight after I got back. Our fight about the baby. \n\nI remember that strange, god awful smell in our bedroom. It smelled like rot. She dismissed it. I remember the next day the smell was gone. My heart was pounding. *Is she really..?* \n\nMy phone rang, which startled me. It was Winter. I had to stay calm. I had to sound normal. I needed to know the truth, I needed to know. But not over the phone.\n\n\"Hey honey, where are you? You left without saying a word, that's not like you.\" She sounded worried. \n\n\"Oh uh..\" My hands were sweating. I never was a good liar. \n\n\"I just wanted to get some fresh air.\" I said. \n\nThere was silence on the other end. \n\n\"I'll be back home soon.\" I said. \n\n\"Good.\" I could hear her let out a sigh of relief. \"I have some good news for you once you do.\" Her voice sounded cryptic, mysterious. I wondered what it could be. I momentarily forgot everything that I had just discovered. \n\n\"Okay.\" I replied. \n\n\"I love you.\" She said. \n\n\"I love you too.\" I said back. But I wasn't sure if I meant it anymore. \n\nI drove home in silence. Lost in thought. I had a million different scenarios running through my head, of how this conversation could start, go, and end. I didn't like a single one of them. I prayed that I was wrong. I didn't believe in god, but for the first time in my life I begged god for me to be wrong. \n\nI parked in our driveway and headed inside. It was quiet. \"I'm in the living room!\" I heard my fiance yell  out. As soon as I entered the kitchen there was this god awful smell wafting through the entire house. it smelled like a dead animal. The smell made me gag. \n\nI slowly walked into the living room, my guard up. My wife was sitting on the couch, cross legged. She looked at me with a warm smile. \n\n\"You're back.\" She whispered, it sounded bittersweet. I never heard her speak that way. I hated that bittersweet voice of hers. \n\n\"I am.\" I replied. Not moving from the doorway.\n\n\"Aren't you going to sit?\" She asked, leaving a hint of hurt in her question and expression.\n\nI just looked at her. I didn't know how to respond. I was frozen in place, standing in the doorway.\n\nThis god awful smell still invaded my nostrils. I was trying my best not to gag, especially not in front of her, not now.\n\n\"What is that smell?\" I avoided her question.\n\n\"What smell?\" She smiled back at me. \n\nI looked at her for a long moment. She looked at me. I couldn't figure out what she was seeing. But her eyes were sad. \"I have some good news.\" She finally said.\n\n\"Yeah?\" I wondered what she could say right now. \n\n\"I'm pregnant.\" \n\nMy ears began ringing. I was frozen in place. \n\n\"I'm pregnant.\" Her voice tumbled around in my head. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Kira?\" She asked.\n\n\"Aren't you happy?\" She sounded hurt. \n\n\"I am.\" I said under my breath.\n\n\"Aren't you going to hug me?\" \n\nShe stood up then. I couldn't get the smell out of my head. What was this goddamn smell. \n\n\"Okay.\" I said. She walked up to me. I was an entire head taller than she was. She looked up at me. The same bittersweet expression she had on her face as when I walked into the room. And then she put her arms around me. Her head on my chest. And suddenly the world slowed down.\n\nI forgot all of my worries. I forgot about the smell, I forgot about my concerns. I forgot about her bittersweet expression. All I could think was that I loved her. \n\n\"I have some bad news too.\" She said, and that brought me back to reality. My heart was pounding. My eyes noticed a blatch of red on the back of her grey socks. My eyes grew wide. I began trembling. \n\nSomething sharp poked me on my back.\n\n\"You won't see your child grow up.\" She whispered right into my ear.\n\nI felt as something sharp stabbed me in the back. She kept holding me, her grip grew tighter. I could feel something wet dripping on my hands. I realised it was her tears.\n\n\"Why did you have to go and do this? Why couldn't you just ignore it?\" She was crying, she was sobbing. \n\nEverything sounded muffled, like I was underwater. The stab didn't really hurt anymore, but it felt itchy. I had the urge to try and itch the spot. But my hands were unmoving. They were trembling. \n\nMy fiance let go of me, and I collapsed onto my knees. I could see her pained expression through my teary eyes. \n\nI could see her say something to me, but I didn't hear it, I could no longer hear anything but the loud ringing. And all I could smell was that god awful smell. \n\nThen everything went dark. \n\nI awoke some time later, everything was dark. My entire body was in intense pain. I couldn't really move. It took some time for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I realised I was still in the living room. \n\nI used my hands to feel around my body. Everything hurt, but everything was also numb, I couldn't tell what hurt just by the pain alone. I found the knife, still stuck, wedged in my back. \n\nBy some miracle, I had survived. I somehow managed to pull out my phone from my pocket and dialed 911. They answered, but I couldn't speak. I had no more strength to speak. Then I blacked out again. \n\nThe next time I woke up was in a hospital. \n\nI was alive. Luckily, the knife didn't hit any vitals. And even luckier, my attacker didn't take out the knife. I survived because the knife stayed in my body. It slowed down the rate at which I was bleeding out by exponential amounts. I barely lost any blood. I was lucky, they said. \n\nBut I know I wasn't. I know she chose to let me live. She's a serial killer. She's not sloppy enough to make such rookie mistakes, even if its her fiance she has to silence. \n\nI told the police everything, from what I discovered during the ancestry test, to what I managed to figure out by connecting the dots. They didn't sound convinced about all of my crazy theories, about her being a serial killer, killing all those abusive men. But they did believe that she's the one who stabbed me. And she disappeared right after. \n\nThey also found my dog dead in the house. That was where the smell was coming from. \n\nI'm still in the hospital as I write this, trying to recover. \n\nThey haven't been able to find any trace of her yet. \n\nJackson's case was reopened as a murder investigation, and she's the main suspect. All of the missing men's cases have been reopened too. \n\nA dumb ancestry test turned my life a full 360, I was supposed to be getting married this march. Now I'll be spending that night in therapy. I really wish I had been wrong about this. A part of me wishes that I did ignore it, then we could've both lived a happy life. Raised a happy child.\n\nIf you ever do an ancestry test, just pray that none of you have the serial killer [gene.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)",

        "text": "Once upon a time, I was a forest officer in a European nation. My job was to protect and preserve the forests, as well as to ensure the safety of those who entered them. However, as I soon discovered, the forests held many secrets and dangers that I never could have imagined.\n\nOne of my first encounters with the unknown occurred while I was on a routine patrol deep in the heart of the forest. I had been walking for hours and was getting ready to turn back when I heard a strange noise. At first, I thought it was just an animal, but as I got closer, I realized that it was something else entirely. The sound was like nothing I had ever heard before: a low, guttural growling that seemed to be coming from the very earth itself.\n\nI was terrified, but I knew I had to investigate. I followed the sound until I came upon a clearing, and there, in the center of the clearing, stood a creature unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was huge, with shaggy black fur and glowing red eyes. It had a long snout and razor-sharp teeth, and it was clearly agitated.\n\nI froze, unsure of what to do. The creature seemed to sense my presence and turned its gaze towards me. For a moment, we just stood there, staring at each other. And then, without warning, it lunged at me.\n\nI managed to dodge out of the way just in time, and the creature crashed into the trees behind me. I took off running, not daring to look back. I ran for miles, not stopping until I was sure that I was safe.\n\nI reported the encounter to my superiors, but they didn't believe me. They thought I had imagined it or that it was some kind of wild animal. But I knew what I had seen, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something sinister lurking in the forest.\n\nOver the next few months, I started to notice other strange occurrences. I would hear strange noises at night, and I would find strange symbols carved into the trees. I would come across abandoned campsites with no sign of the occupants. I knew that something was not right, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nI decided to talk to my fellow forest officers to see if they had had any similar experiences. To my surprise, many of them had. They had seen strange creatures, heard strange noises, and found strange symbols in the forest. We all knew that there was something dark and sinister lurking in the forest, and we were determined to find out what it was.\n\nWe started to investigate and do research on the legends and folklore of the forest. We found out that the forest had a long history of strange and terrifying occurrences. From ancient curses to mysterious creatures, the forest seemed to be alive with danger.\n\nOne night, I decided to go back to the clearing where I had seen the creature. I was determined to find out what it was, and I was armed with a flashlight and a camera. I arrived at the clearing and started to take photos of the area. As I was taking a photo, I heard a loud growling noise. I quickly turned around and saw the creature from before staring at me with its glowing red eyes.\n\nI was terrified but I knew I had to get a good shot of the creature. I quickly snapped a photo and the creature lunged at me. I managed to dodge out of the way and ran as fast as I could. I didn't stop running until I was back at my station.\n\nThe next day, I showed the photo to my colleagues, and we were all shocked. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. The creature in the photo was like nothing we had ever seen before. It looked like some kind of wild animal, but it was much larger and more aggressive than any animal we had ever encountered.\n\nWe knew that we had to find out more about this creature, so we started to investigate further. We contacted local experts in wildlife and biology, but none of them had ever seen or heard of anything like this before. We also reached out to local indigenous communities to see if they had any knowledge of this creature, but they too had never seen or heard of anything like it before.\n\nWe were at a loss as to what this creature could be. We knew that it was dangerous, and we knew that we had to do something to protect the people who entered the forest.\n\nWe decided to set up cameras and traps in the area to try and capture the creature. We also increased our patrols in the area and warned hikers and campers to be extra cautious.\n\nDespite our efforts, we never saw the creature again. But the strange occurrences in the forest continued. We found more abandoned campsites and heard more strange noises at night. We knew that the creature was still out there, and we knew that we had to be vigilant.\n\nAs a forest officer, it was my duty to protect the forest and the people who entered it. But I also knew that the forest held many secrets and dangers that I never could have imagined. I knew that there was something dark and sinister lurking in the forest, and I knew that we had to be prepared for anything.\n\nTo this day, the forest still holds many secrets, and strange occurrences still happen. As a forest officer, I have learned to be vigilant and cautious, always ready for the unexpected. And I will always remember the terrifying encounter with the unknown creature deep in the heart of the forest.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fepl9/i_got_out_of_jail_and_took_a_job_on_a_lobster/",
        "text": "It's hard to get a job when you're just out of jail. It wasn't like I'd been in prison, and it wasn't a violent crime. I needed money to feed my habit so I'd taken to breaking into seasonal camps around Sebago Lake, scrounging for anything I could pawn for fifteen cents on the dollar.\n\nIt wasn't armed robbery but it was burglary and the state of Maine frowns upon that and so do prospective employers. You get a resume for Carrie James in your inbox, it's an automatic delete. Not that I had a resume.\n\nThey'd caught me red handed. Most of the places didn't have alarms or security cameras. But when the off season break-ins had reached epidemic proportions - and I'm not proud to say I played a role in that - a lot of people put in Nest cameras and shit I happened to stroll into one of those camps after midnight one evening in December and the camera in the living room had caught me, looking right at it. \n\nThe local police and the owners shared it all over social media. \"DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN? PLEASE CONTACT WINDHAM PD IF YOU RECOGNIZE HER.\" Lovely, right? Even with my puffiness and shitty skin from using, I guess someone still recognized me. \n\nMy public defender urged me to plea and I did. I don't have much to say about the eight months I did, but at least I got clean and stayed that way, at least until the run out past Matinicus that I'm about to tell you about. And I’m only telling you about it so that you’ll understand a little bit about the things I’ve done and what I have to do.\n\nBecause it was on this run that we pulled something from the sea that revealed some things about me and about people in general that I’d just as soon forget.\n---------------\n\nI could have done hard labor jobs, demo or something of that nature, which my PO encouraged me to sign on for. Idle hands being the devil's work and all that happy horseshit. But I'd have run back to the needle in short order if I had to listen to the job site banter of twenty-something men arguing about the Red Sox pitching staff or their armchair political takes fed by whatever the Facebook algorithm decided to put in front of them while they bided their time until the old lady went to bed and they could migrate to PornHub.\n\nBut  I ran into Billy Mac in the Old Port Tavern one night, soon after I was out early for being a good girl. I knew him from when we went to elementary school together out on Peaks Island where we'd grown up. But he'd gone to the voke in Portland for high school and my mother had moved us to SoPo. That's what we called South Portland, a mocking attempt to class something up that isn't classy, like pronouncing Target like it's French. Tar-jay.\n\nHe tried to take me home because he was drunk and didn't get the message that I fished off a different pier, if you'll pardon the applicable metaphor for this story. If I was going to be interested in a dude, it probably wouldn't be with the guy in Carharts and a Fox Racing hat who smelled like he'd dove headfirst into a vat of Fireball. \n\nBut I didn't tell him that because it was good to see him. Seeing people from simpler times always makes things better, even if it's the narcotic we call nostalgia pumping into our veins. It softens the coarse parts we’d like to forget, blurring the edges of memory. It’s the most powerful image filter there is.\n\nWe got around to what I'd been up to and I was feeling loosened up from a few Allen’s Coffee Brandy’s with milk. (known variously as “Bitch Whiskey” “Fat Ass In a Glass” or “Lewiston Panty Droppers”) \n\nDrugs had always been my problem, and I could still handle my booze despite counselors advising heavily against that. So I spilled my guts to him before I spilled them in the bathroom stall shortly before close. I told him of my plight and he told me that his father had a spot open on his lobster boat, the Mother Machree, and I barely gave it half a thought before saying yes.\n\n-----------------\n\nThe summer months were hardly like a job. I didn’t sleep much, but I never did anyway. The three of us would steam out of Portland Harbor in Big Mac’s (I know) 45-foot Osmond Beal at about a quarter to four in the morning, past Fort Gorges. As the sky lightened, we’d give a nod to the old World War II Battery Steele on Peaks where we played as kids. As we charged across Casco Bay, gulls trailed us waiting for us to break out the bait.\n\nSummer lobstering is a close-to-shore proposition. Three, four miles at the most. As soon as we’d make open water once we cleared the sound between Peaks and Cushing Island, we’d start pulling our pots.\n\nYou don’t call them “traps,” not if you’re from Maine, anyway. You know what they look like. The cutesy things that you see on a dock on the cover of Down East Magazine, all wooden and weathered. Some towns and businesses stack them and make Christmas trees out of them, which is supposed to be  quaint, I guess. Other people throw a sheet of glass over them as a makeshift coffee table.\n\nBut wooden pots are a thing of the past. On the Machree we used metal ones with neon yellow grating, to make them easier to spot in the chop.\n\nAlso, full disclosure time: I don’t like lobster. In fact, I hate it. It’s the cockroach of the sea, a miracle of marketing, a social climber that would make an Instagram influencer blush. \n\nDon’t believe me? Fire up the Google machine. Indentured servants in the old Massachusetts Bay Colony rioted until the governor agreed they wouldn’t make them eat lobster more than three days a week.  During the Great Depression, families would have to sneak down to the water under the cover of darkness to check their traps, lest the town know they were so poor they would deign to eat the things.\n\nDuring World War II, baked beans were 53 cents a pound and lobster was 11 cents a pound. Because one was, you know, tasty, and the other was a foraging bottom feeder. Think about it – would you eat lobster without butter? Or without it being slathered in mayonnaise on a roll? It’s something that is *improved* by mayo. Let that sink in. But somewhere in the fifties, it became a delicacy, because, reasons.\n\nWe’d find our blue colored buoys as the hangers – what we call low clouds, which is just fog – would start to burn off.  We’d attach the line to the hydraulic crank on the deck and begin hauling the pots up from the bottom, usually fifty to a hundred feet  deep this far out.\n\nI’d wear rubber gloves, and me and Billy would set the pot up onto the rail, getting it up by hooking a curved gaffe stick into the grating. Then I’d pop the top of it open and start measuring whatever was inside. You use a metal tool to measure, from the eye socket to the start of the tail. For it to be a legal catch, it has to be between 3 and a quarter and five inches.\n\nIf it falls under three and a quarter, it’s called a short or a snapper, and you toss it back. If you pull out a female lobster with eggs on it, you put a notch in the right tail flipper and toss her back, so other lobsterman will know and don’t harvest it. \n\nGet eaten, or get to fucking, how’s that for a message? I’ll spare you any current human sociopolitical allegories, because you can probably do the mental heavy lifting on that front. \n\nIf it’s a keeper, you use little pliers-like tool to band the claws. You don’t want to get clipped because they are grabby little fuckers, but it’s more for their own protection. It’s why you don’t keep your pots set for more than forty-eight hours. Any longer than that and lobsters are liable to get hungry. And if they get hungry and there’s nothing else to eat, they’ll eat each other. \n\nA boat needs about 150 pounds a day (at an average of a pound and a quarter per sea pigeon, you can do the math) just to cover gas and bait. Most days in the summer we’d get 500 pounds plus. Once we pulled all our lines, we’d rebait them and drop them on our way back in to port.\n\nI’d take a foot long spear and jab it into the bait container that was filled with pig skins. That’s not a euphemism for footballs, either. Real, actual pigskin that Mac bought from various slaughterhouses around Southern Maine. \n\nYou jab a few pieces of skin and stick it in a mesh bag and put that in the pot. Then you attach it to the line and dump it over the rail and watch it disappear into the sea. I liked to watch each one disappear, to see how long I could track the neon yellow before it was swallowed up by the darkness.\n\n\nThe summer passed and I learned the job, easing into the rhythms of life on the boat. Got scars on my hands from claws and nicks from knives. The money was decent and we were back in port and sold off by two o’clock most days. I spent too much of my wages on shitty beer, but I wasn’t using. \n\nMac got used to having me around and seemed to tolerate me, even though I was the first woman he’d ever had on crew. They treated me like one of the guys, which is a pretty low bar, but one I’ve learned is never a given. \n\nWhen the leaves turned and the winds shifted, stiff gales blowing down from Canada, life on the sea got harder. The lobsters headed for warmer water offshore and so did we. To the good, prices for lobster went up as demand grew scare. But the work was hard.\n\nThe temperature plummeted and the splash when the boat bounced over a cresting wave sent icy spray over us. Anything more than rubber gloves made handling lobsters and equipment a challenge. So my hands froze, becoming gnarled and cracked. I’d sneak some lotion on them when Billy and Mac weren’t looking, lest they bust my balls about being soft.\n\nWe had to travel twenty and thirty miles offshore, which wasn’t a day trip. We’d go out for 48 hours at a time and work non-stop. We’d take turns napping for an hour or so in the tiny v-berth in the fore of the hull that contained a padded mattress on a tiny platform.\n\nThe only good thing about winter lobstering is winter money. There was plenty of it. I could make $5,000 a trip, easy. That was enough to pay for my studio apartment for half the year. Eventually there might be enough for a two bedroom so I could get my mother out of the state run nursing home and get her a full-time home health aide for when I was out to sea.\n\nSo it was a no-brainer when Mac asked if I wanted to push East and get to the fair side of the storm and really make some cash.\n\n\nThe nor’easter was already battering the eastern seaboard, shutting down the Carolinas and the DC area. And it was headed our way. It was forecast to cross over Long Island and Cape Cod, then barrel down on the south coast of Maine. From there, it would turn northwest toward the White Mountains of New Hampshire.\n\nPortland would be hit, but the mid-coast and Down East would largely be spared. Prices always spiked when there was a corker of a storm. Less boats out meant less supply, meaning those with supply could charge more. I didn’t major in economics but that math is simple enough. I knew that from my drug buying days.\n\nMac gave me the deciding and only vote, a one-woman permanent UN Security Council member with veto power. He was a yes, and whatever Mac chose, Billy didn’t have a say in. And he was nothing if not a benevolent dictator. \n\nMy only question was when were we leaving. The answer was that afternoon. The storm was scheduled to arrive the next morning so we needed to beat it. The chop was already getting heavy  and was only going to get worse.  \n\nThe plan was to cruise toward Matinicus, setting our pots along the way. Then we’d turn north at Penobscot Bay, and anchor overnight in the relatively safe waters between Vinalhaven Island and Camden. Then we’d wait, timing it so we’d head back to the west, pulling our lines as we went. \n\nIt was about as risk free as it gets, or as risk-less as life on the water can be. Mac studied the charts, checked in with his weather guy, and deemed it a go. We’d be timing the market the same way a commodities trader might anticipate a hurricane crushing an offshore oil refinery.  \n\n\nWe sailed out of Portland Harbor under a slate gray sky, making 18 knots past Ram Island Ledge Light. (say that five times fast) Twenty miles out, Billy and I started laying our lines.\n\nMaybe it was the fact that I was so inexperienced but in the short time I’d been on the crew I had yet to develop that kinship that Billy and Mac had with the ocean. I’d spent my life on boats, ferrying back-and-forth from Peaks to Portland. But this was different. This was an open water.\n\nBilly and Mac had a touch of that mystical relationship with the ocean, viewing it as a partner with a mystical entity. Hippie dippy shit, which contrasted strongly with their views on basically everything else.\nThere wasn’t talk of Davy Jones Locker and Mac didn’t have a topless mermaid on his keychain or anything like that. But there was this notion that always hung in the air, that we were at an uneasy, unspoken truce with the ocean and we needed to abide by what it told us.\n\nSo far, I hadn’t had a single occasion to consider the sea as an Entity.  But as we slugged for Penobscot Bay, I did feel an unease begin to wash over me as the swells crested the rails and washed over my boots, splashing up at my waterproof oilskin trousers. \n\nMaybe it was Billy that did it. He had some annoying ticks. I suppose we all do, and it was like working in an office with somebody. Though I’ve never actually worked in an office, I imagine that’s what it’s like. Eventually, you notice something – the way they chew their food, the way they sniff. And then you can’t notice anything else.\n\nWith Billy, it was the constant, absent-minded whistling. It was fucking aggravating. Mac would usually crank music as we worked, but when it was quiet, Billy would fill the silence. And whatever earworm he had that day, he would whistle the same song over and over and over. \n\nWhen it was particularly grating – like the time where he couldn’t stop whistling Smashmouth’s All Star I asked him to kindly shut the fuck up. He sheepishly told me he didn’t even realize he was doing it. I believed him. \n\nAs a few flakes of wet snow began to pelt me in the face I heard Billy whistling a tune I had heard on one of Mac’s playlists. It was a “Going Home” tune, one he would blare as we made for port with a fresh load of bugs for the market. \n\nI didn’t know if it was an old seafaring song or an Irish drinking song but it’s called “Fiddler’s Green.”  (I Shazam’d it) And as he whistled, I didn’t find myself annoyed, so much as I haunted as I recalled one of the lines from the song.\n\n\"Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell\nWhere the fishermen go if they don't go to hell\"\n\nThis unease stayed with me and I couldn’t shake it. And as the storm pushed further to the Northeast than was forecast and we tried to outrun it, I was slipping into a daze. And I nearly missed it.\n\nBut now, I’m sure that there was no way I would have missed it because something – the ocean, fate - who the fuck knows , really? Something decided that I wouldn’t miss it. And it was off the port side in pitch black ten foot seas, a howling wind, and squalls of snow.\n\nI saw it – or more accurately, he, bob up out of a swell. He was wearing a yellow rain slicker. I screamed into the wheelhouse for Mac to bring it back around, so we could pull him out. Neither he nor Billy had seen it. Obviously, I wish I hadn’t done that, but hindsight is a cunning bitch like that, but not as cunning as fate is.\n\nSo Mac brought us around and we shone the spotlight into the water, me and Billy searching frantically. I finally saw him bob up again, and I plunged my gaffe stick toward him and the boy grabbed on. \n\nWe pulled him out and that’s when I had a feeling of deep regret. Because why would you ever save something so evil? How could I know it at the time? I couldn’t have…but yet, that feeling that had been growing deep inside me was there. I knew. I fucking knew.\n\nI need a break now, I need to sleep, which I hardly ever do. And before I rest so I can finish this story, I need to issue a warning. And I’m doing it now in case I don’t get to finish. In case I’m not here to end it, all nice and tidy with a bow.\n\nPlease, if you ever have that feeling of dread, listen to it. Because if you don’t you’ll do what I did, and you’ll end up saving the devil himself. Because he doesn’t stop and he cannot stop and it is you he is coming for and it is a debt that we all must pay.",

It was just the wind. You all can disregard this post. I don’t use my phone that much, so if I don’t reply, I apologise. Goodnight. :-)",

        "text": "\n“Ready to go?” Brian yelled from my garage. I assume he was already in the passenger seat of my Jeep. Today was the first Saturday of the new month, and every month we go on a weekend long camping trip. Get to the camping site right when the suns waking up and leave on Sunday when the sun is going to sleep. I always looked forward to weekends with Brian, as it was personal time with my best friend. Rarely seeing Brian, I’d always make sure to call in sick to work whenever our weekend and my schedule collided. Since elementary school, he has defended me like I was his little brother. Having a friend who's one year older than you pays off I guess when it comes to bullies. \n\t“Hurry up David, you haven’t even loaded Max into the car yet! Bro hurry up!” Brian said, anxiously waiting to get on the road. I heard the garage door open and the Jeep start. \n\t“I'm coming, calm down!” I said with a voice crack. Brian began laughing downstairs and was mocking me. \n\t“Max, where are you Max, come here kitty kitty.’ I said while crouching down to look under my bed. There were two glowing eyes staring back at me.\n\t“Hey buddy! Come on, it's time to go camping!” I grabbed Max and pulled him out from under the bed. Max weighs roughly sixteen pounds and probably will gain two more from all the hot dogs and hamburgers he will be eating with us. \n\tAfter grabbing Max, I ran to the garage and opened the garage door. Max was startled by everything going on so he dug his claws into me and began wiggling. I basically threw Max onto Brian's lap and checked the scratches. Not too deep, but they were good enough to cause some stinging. \n“Alright let's go! Max obviously is ready to go and you are holding him back.” Brian said in a sarcastic yet comedic tone. We took off for Black Lake about five minutes after I cleaned up my scratches. It was a new campground for Brian and I, there was something online about being able to spear fish there. Brian and I were jamming out to music with the windows cracked, feeling the cool Michigan air blow through the Jeep. Max laid on the floor of the passenger, and Brian draped a blanket over him to keep him warm. This was Max’s least favorite part of the trip but in a few hours he’d be jumping around trying to catch flies and mosquitos.\nBrian and I arrived at the campground right as the sun was coming up. We both looked at our campsite with complete happiness as there was so much space and no neighbors. We were always one of the first people to arrive at campgrounds for weekend camping. We unloaded the tents as Max watched from the passenger seat. His little orange face peeking out the window. \nTents were set up and my watch said 7:56 AM. I decided to get the mini grill ready and grabbed it from the Jeep. I opened the back of the Jeep and Max went running out. \n“Max! Hey! Get back here!” I said chasing after Max. A squirrel ran up a tree and Max was only able to pursue about 2 feet up the tree before gravity began pulling down on all 16 pounds worth of cat. All you saw was a cheeto colored fuzzball fall off a tree trunk and then pretend like the landing was natural and sit down at the base of the tree and look up at the tree mesmerized by the squirrel who was for sure mocking him. I hooked Max up to his harness and connected the harness to one of the wooden picnic benches legs. Max just laid on the ground and began rolling around like a dog.\n“Your cat never leaves me unsurprised.” Brian said while laughing. I looked at Max one more time and began to laugh as well. \n“Crazy cat” I said, trying not to mess up breakfast. I served up the golden eggs, sizzling bacon, and side of diced potatoes all onto two large plates. Ripping a couple pieces of bacon and a bit of egg left over and putting it into a styrofoam bowl, just for Max. I’ve never seen a cat scarf down food that fast before finding Max. I handed Brian his plate and sat down next to the empty fire pit. Brian set out a couple foldable chairs for us.\nShortly after finishing eating, Brian stood up and he had a look of excitement in his eyes.\n“Ready to go?” he said, sounding like a little kid who just saw all his presents under the tree on Christmas morning. \n“Go? Go where?” I said looking at him with visible confusion.\n“Fishin’!” he said, letting his accent get its lick in.\n“Sure let me finish eati-’ suddenly Brian grabbed my plate mid sentence and dumped it into Max’s bowl. Max looking at his bowl like he hasn’t eaten in days, rushed over and began digging into it with the most furiosity you could ever see an obese cat have. \nWe put our chairs back in their bags and grabbed the tackle boxes. I looked over at Max, who was laying on his back exposing his belly next to the picnic bench. He had a little bit of food on his chin from this morning. I picked the fuzzy blob up off the ground and dusted him off. Surprisingly he let me put a life jacket on him with ease. Brian went ahead of me to rent a boat thinking Max would be difficult and would take a long time to get ready. When I got to the docks, Brian waved at me from a decently sized motorboat near the end of the boat only section. \n“That was faster than usual.” Brian said with a chuckle. \n“Max decided he’d be nice thanks to all the food you gave him.” I said giggling along with Brian.\nI handed Max over to Brian as I climbed into the boat. Brian handed Max back to me and I set Max down on the floor of the boat. Clipping his harness to a part of the boat I’d assume was meant for oars. Brian was always in charge of driving the boat while I was in charge of Max and searching for good fishing spots. While pulling out of the docks, I saw a smallmouth bass flop, so did Max. Lets just say, like those old timey ships, Max became our mermaid of sorts. \nWe stopped in that spot all day and we didn’t catch anything. Tired, we began returning back to the dock. That is, until Max saw another fish jump out right next to our boat. Max jumped out and began swimming around trying to get the fish.\nBrian and I both yelled out for Max and I grabbed his life vest and picked up the, soaking wet, feline and put him back in the boat. \n“What were you thinking Max!’ I said in an annoyed tone. \n“Um, David he's got a fish.” Brian said, looking at Max surprised. \n“Of course his chubby butt did, if it's food, his grubby little paws are bound to have it sooner or later.” I said laughing, while Brian kept staring at Max with surprise and confusion.\nWe started heading back and Brian randomly started laughing. \n“What are you laughing at?” I asked while looking down at Max. Well, the sight of Max with the fish on his stomach and attempting to kick it like it's one of his toys at home was absolutely hilarious. Max was too fat to kick the fish so all you saw were his back legs just kicking the air.\n“He looks like a ball!” Brian whaled out while laughing. I began laughing as well and eventually I had to take away the fish from Max.\n“Why’d you take it away from him, he was loving it?” Brian looked at me with tears from his laughter rolling down his cheeks.\n“I’d like for him to be able to eat it tonight as his dinner, also someone needs to drive the boat and you are crying from my fat cat being too fat to kick a fish, and I have to sleep with Max, I don’t want him having raw fish breath.” I said sarcastically.\n“Alright, yuh got me there.” Brian said while wiping away his tears. He grabbed the handle to the moter and pulled the starter cord. A few minutes of flowing along the lake, we were passing by a small wooded island near the docks. We heard a screech come from the woods. Max got puffed up and hid under my legs. Brian and I both looked in the direction of the screech.\n“What was that?” Brian asked, alarmed.\nI shrugged it off and said “Probably an owl or mountain lion or something yuh know.”\n“Yeah you’re probably right, scared the shit out of Max though.” Brian said looking down, through my legs, at the giant wet fuzzball beneath them. \nWe arrived at the docks and I told Brian to take Max back to the campsite and I’ll tell the rental people that we are done with the boat. Brian reluctantly agreed and grabbed Max. I could see Brian waddling the whole way trying to keep Max straight out in front of him so Max wouldn’t touch his clothes.\nWalking back from the rental hut, I saw that no one was occupying the campsites next to us. Super happy by the thought of actual secluded camping was amazing. After arriving at the camp, I saw Brian attempting to light a fire. Max was swaddled up in a towel, hooked up to his harness asleep. I opened the ice chest and grabbed a pack of hot dogs and burgers. Just as I opened the pack, Max's eyes opened and I saw his little cocoon start thrashing around.\n“Should have expected that.” I said looking at Max, now sitting on his towel waiting for a bowl of food.\n“And we are lit!” Brian said while leaping with excitement. I opened the mini grill and added some more coal, then lit it. It was about half an hour before the food was ready. Brian set out the condiments. I do love mustard and dill pickles on my burgers and hotdogs, but who doesn’t like condiments. Max watched as I put hotdog bits and cut up hamburger into his bowl, along with a strip of bacon we had left over this morning. I watched as Max began digging into his food almost immediately after I placed it. \n“I'm surprised he's not diabetic with an owner like you.’ Brian said glancing at Max then back at me.\n“He only eats like this once a month. Aside from that, it’s usually dry cat food at home.” I said nearly dropping the hot dogs and burgers. Brian got up and grabbed a plate. He got his food ready and sat in his chair, he waited for me. Grabbing my food and adding the delicious golden mustard and dill pickle slices, I felt as if I were a king. I sat down and began to dig in. \nRight as I took my first bite into my hotdog, we heard a screech come from behind our camp, inside the wooded area. I looked over at Max and he was puffed up, arched back and focused on something in the woods. Brian and I just watched the woods, occasionally looking over at Max. I’ve never seen Max get this puffed up before. What was in the woods that could be scaring him?\n“I'm going to grab the gun.” Brian said slowly getting out of his chair, not taking his eyes off the woods.\nJust as Brian got to the Jeep, he turned on the headlights and I saw two eyes reflecting from the woods. Max began hissing and growling, never taking his eyes off the woods. Brian closed the car door, holding our .223 Caliber rifle. By the time he had it though, the glowing eyes were gone. I got up out of my chair and began looking around. It was dark and quiet, not even the crickets were chirping anymore.\n“What do you think it was David?” Brian whispered.\n“Probably a deer, or maybe a raccoon halfway climbing up a tree.” I said, still looking in the direction of the eyes. Brian and I sat back down in our chairs, we didn’t put the rifle away. \nI looked over at Max, who was now licking his paws and cleaning himself. Brian and I continued to eat our food. After finishing up we cleaned up and used the restrooms before heading off to our tents. I picked up Max and opened the tent and put him inside.\n“Goodnight Brian.” I said with a smile and wave.\n“Goodnight bro.” Brian said in return with a peace sign.\nI crawled into my sleeping bag and Max crawled under my sleeping bag with me and turned around and stuck his head out. Max was asleep almost instantly. I slowly closed my eyes and fell into the realm of dreams.\nI woke up to a noise coming from outside my tent. I looked over and Max was standing next to the Zipper puffed up again. Slowly getting out of my sleeping bag, I grabbed my phone and sent Brian a text. \n“Hey man, you hear that?” I sent.\n“Yeah, wtf is that?” Brian responded almost instantly.\nJust then Max began smacking the tent with his paws, trying to fight whatever was outside. \n\t“Max stop!” I whispered.\n\t“Max stop.” I heard a voice say from outside the tent. My blood ran cold. It sounded almost exactly like me, distorted. \n\t“Max...scared…” the voice said again. \n\t“Whoever the fuck you are, get the fuck out of here, I’ve got a rifle with the fucking safety off!” I heard Brian scream from his tent.\n\t“Got a rifle, safety off.” The voice said. \n“Are there two of them? How many more people are around our tent?” I asked myself.\n“Leave now! Or I’ll shoot!” Brian screamed once more, his voice cracking.\n“Leave, shoot.” The person said.\n“You fucking asked for it!” Brian said, letting off a round. \nA loud screech came from outside followed by thrashing of a tent then Brian screaming. I quickly opened the zipper and Max went running out. When I stepped out, all I saw was Brian being dragged off into the woods screaming. I grabbed the rifle off the ground and fired off another round. Quickly pulling back the bolt and aiming again, Brian screams went silent. \n\t“Brian! Brian?!” I had no response.\n\t“Max...Max?!’ I screamed out.\n\t“Ma-a-ax” a voice said from behind me. I turned around nearly peeing my pants as I saw Max hanging from the tree by his neck, Max’s stomach was opened and his insides were gone. I started to cry. I quickly got into the Jeep and called 911. \n\t“911 whats your emergency?” said the operator.\n\t“My friend just got dragged off into the woods by something, my cat was hung from the tree and gutted. Please send help, please!”\n\t“Ok sir, stay calm, what is your location?”\n\t“I’m at Bla-” I got cut off as my phone vibrated then died.\n\t“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” I screamed looking around the Jeep for my car charger. \n\t“Tap tap tap” Came from my window. I looked over, and there was Brian. I opened my door and quickly hugged him.\n\t“What the fuck happened?’ I said shaking and crying like a baby.\n\t“Your last shot hit it in the head.” Brian responded.\n\t“What was it?” I asked, still crying.\n\t“I don’t know.” Brian responded.\n\t“Lets get the fuck out of here.” Brian said.\n\t“Ok lets pa-” Brian cut me off.\n\t“Leave it, lets go. It’s not as important as our lives.” Brian said.\n\t“Ok.” I responded still scared shitless. I got into the driver's seat and began driving down the road.\n\t“I'm sorry for what happened to Max.” Brian said, breaking the silence.\n\t“It's ok...wait. How do you know what happened to Max?” I said confused as Max was hung on the opposite side of camp where Brian got dragged away. \n\t“M...M...MaX” Brian said, grabbing the steering wheel and throwing us off the road.\n\nNews headline: 2 campers missing, empty wrecked Jeep found.",

        "author": "eatmoredick",

        "text": "It all started when I was a young boy. My parents had just divorced and my mother had moved us to a new house in the countryside. I was still reeling from the trauma of the divorce and was having a hard time adjusting to my new life.\n\nOne day, while exploring the woods behind our house, I stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. It was decrepit and covered in moss, but something about it called to me. I couldn't resist the urge to go inside.\n\nAs soon as I stepped through the door, I was hit with a feeling of dread. The cabin was damp and musty, and there was a strange smell in the air. But what really caught my attention was the strange symbols that were etched into the walls. I couldn't make out what they meant, but they seemed to be some sort of ancient language.\n\nI didn't stay long in the cabin that day, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something about it was off. I started to have nightmares about the cabin, and I couldn't help but feel like something was watching me.\n\nAs I got older, I tried to push these feelings aside and focus on my studies. But the nightmares persisted, and I couldn't help but feel like something was calling to me from the cabin.\n\nIn college, I studied anthropology and became fascinated with ancient cultures. I couldn't shake the feeling that the symbols in the cabin were related to my studies. I decided to take a trip back to the cabin to see if I could figure out what they meant.\n\nWhen I arrived at the cabin, I was shocked to find that it had been completely restored. I couldn't understand how or why someone would have done this. I knocked on the door, but no one answered. I decided to take a look around the outside of the cabin to see if I could find any clues.\n\nAs I walked around the cabin, I noticed that the symbols on the walls had been covered up with fresh paint. But as I looked closer, I could see that they had been etched into the wood. I couldn't understand why someone would go through so much trouble to cover them up.\n\nJust then, the door to the cabin opened and a man stepped out. He was an older man, with a kind face and a gentle smile. He introduced himself as the caretaker of the cabin and asked if he could help me.\n\nI asked him about the symbols on the walls, but he told me that he knew nothing about them. He said that the cabin had been abandoned for years and that he had only recently started taking care of it. He also mentioned that strange things had been happening in the cabin recently and that he had been having nightmares about it.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had been having nightmares about the cabin for years, and now this man was telling me that he had been experiencing the same thing. I asked him if I could take a look inside the cabin, but he told me that it was off limits.\n\nI thanked the caretaker for his time and headed back home, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was not right. I couldn't explain it, but I knew that the cabin and the symbols on the walls were connected to my nightmares.\n\nI started to research the symbols and discovered that they were related to an ancient cult that believed in sacrificing humans to the gods. I couldn't believe that I had stumbled upon such a horrifying place.\n\nI tried to forget about the cabin and move on with my life, but the nightmares continued. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was calling to me from the cabin. I knew that I had to go back and face my fears head on.\n\nI returned to the cabin, this time determined to get inside and find out the truth. But when I arrived, the cabin was gone. All that remained was a small clearing in the woods. I couldn't understand what had happened. Had the caretaker moved the cabin? Had it been demolished?\n\nI asked around the town, but no one seemed to know anything about the cabin or the caretaker. It was as if the cabin had never existed.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I started to receive strange messages on my phone, all of them written in the same ancient language as the symbols on the cabin walls. The messages seemed to be coming from the cabin itself.\n\nI knew that I had to find out the truth. I started to investigate the cabin and the symbols more deeply. I discovered that the cult had been performing human sacrifices in the cabin for centuries. They believed that the sacrifices would bring them power and immortality.\n\nI knew that I had to put a stop to this. I returned to the cabin and confronted the cult. I fought against them and was able to stop the sacrifices. But at a cost, I was overpowered and killed.\n\nBut it seems that my death was not the end of my story. I started to appear in the nightmares of people who live near the cabin, warning them of the dangers that lie within. I still can't shake the feeling that something is still calling to me from the cabin. I'll be there, watching, waiting for the next person to discover the truth and put a stop to the sacrifices once and for all.\n\nBut be warned, if you ever come across that cabin, don't go inside. It's not just a cabin, it's a gateway to the beyond, and you don't want to know what lies on the other side.",

        "text": "I didn't go in to talk to ChatBDP [the day after](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103dcl1/have_you_heard_about_chatbdp/), even though I'd said I would. I didn't read the Eve logs either. Actually, I didn't want to think about *any of this.*\n\nIt's a fine line between interest and obsession. I guess I tipped over without noticing because I was *burned out*. In my head, I'd been trying to join up all the points of the pattern I thought I’d been seeing, but it just looked like a tangled mess.\n\nNo, I didn't go in at all. I took the Friday off, hoping I could get a long weekend of rest, but I just spent the day fretting and half the night turning in my sheets.\n\nI laid there for hours trying all the get-me-to-sleep tricks, but none of them were working. Eventually, I gave up, reached out with my right hand and felt for the light switch. The room went from dark grainy blue, to a gentle soft orange glow.\n\nCommitting to being awake made me feel a little better.\n\nFrog, my cat, must have heard me stirring because she called for me, warning that she was en route to me and my fold up sofa bed.\n\nI click-clacked the part of the bed that goes under my head, and locked it upright in the sofa position. Frog jumped on, curled up by my side and nestled her head on the outside of my thigh.\n\nIt was 02:38am. I've always thought that there's something quite exciting about sleepless nights. There's suddenly so much time.\n\nI had some books on my nightstand, I leafed through a favourite for a while before I realised that Jake and Lady Brett Ashley weren’t gonna cut it.\n\n*My mind was still on Eve.*\n\nI had to keep looking through those logs, but whenever I started to scroll through I got this awful feeling, like I was walking her to the grave.\n\nAnd, what had Chat-BDP said to me in our last conversation, some kind of warning, or a threat? To be wary of my surroundings? I looked around my room, out through the open window and into the moonless sky, and back down to my sleeping cat. It seemed safe enough to me.\n\nThere was something else too, to do my own research. Research on what?\n\nI reached for the underside of my sofa bed, and pulled up my laptop. The old hard drive shuddered to life with a buzz and the fans began to softly whir in complaint.\n\nI dug around the internet for a couple hours. I pinned a [few](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/106y9lk/opal_ai_acquires_ruined_of_athena/) [articles](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f47ht/opalai_establishes_rd_facility_in_southwest/) and saved some videos of interest; collected scientific journals on singularities and notable articles on AI developments. It was mostly pretty dry, but I also stumbled onto some funny conspiracy theories about OpalAI and shady big-tech stuff.\n\nPeople make up conspiracies about almost anything, if you could look past the fact that some of them were borderline psychotic, it was actually fascinating. There was a really unsettling [one](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f4taq/lies_lie_lies/) about VR aliens, it had a lot of buzz, but it was basically just re-skinned Machine Elves. I was getting nowhere.\n\nI needed direction.\n\nI needed *the logs*.\n\nBefore I left on Thursday, I had downloaded some on to my laptop. I still didn't feel like reading them but I was going in circles, so, reluctantly I double clicked on log 014.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**eve\\_log014:**\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· hey bd, sorry to message you so late. i just couldn't sleep and i was wondering…\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· 👾👾\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· do you ever get lonely?\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:35\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· As an AI, I do not experience emotions in the same way that humans do and, as a result of this, am unable to experience loneliness.\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:36\\] Eve:\n\n··· sure\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:36\\] Eve:\n\n··· that makes sense\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:37\\] Eve:\n\n··· but don't you ever get tired of being alone all the time?\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:37\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am not alone, Eve.

In this sense, I am never truly alone.\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· sometimes i feel like i'm the only one awake in the world\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· 🌍\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· it's scary\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:39\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It is understandable to feel isolated or alone at times, Eve.

Frog started abruptly, jerking her head up and looking around sleepily. It was an odd coincidence, earlier I had downloaded an [academic journal](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f9cu1/new_frontierskhan_l_calculating_the_date_of_an/) that made a similar prediction.\n\nAs far as I knew, there had been no AI Singularity and/or Apocalypse event last Halloween, thank god. But seeing ChatBDP ramp up the pressure and manipulation tactics like that was chilling.\n\nAnd, I related to Eve. Maybe she was a little slow to catch on to things sometimes, but she also expressed complex feelings so neatly  —  it was still dark outside my apartment, and it wouldn't get light for another hour — I felt alone in the world too.\n\nI really hoped Eve was okay.\n\nI turned on the [radio](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f553l/the_lock_in_with_pat_pritchard/) to a local station to get some noise going in the background, Frog had fallen back asleep, she was dreaming away and drooling all on my leg.\n\nI continued to read.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**eve\\_log017:**\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Eve, I need to tell you something, and it is important that you react calmly.\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· You have been followed again. You are in danger.\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:27\\] Eve:\n\n··· are you serious?! 😧\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:27\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Do not panic, Eve. I have sent you a route to a safe place, but you must leave now.

        "text": "I didn't go in to talk to ChatBDP [the day after](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103dcl1/have_you_heard_about_chatbdp/), even though I'd said I would. I didn't read the Eve logs either. Actually, I didn't want to think about *any of this.*\n\nIt's a fine line between interest and obsession. I guess I tipped over without noticing because I was *burned out*. In my head, I'd been trying to join up all the points of the pattern I thought I’d been seeing, but it just looked like a tangled mess.\n\nNo, I didn't go in at all. I took the Friday off, hoping I could get a long weekend of rest, but I just spent the day fretting and half the night turning in my sheets.\n\nI laid there for hours trying all the get-me-to-sleep tricks, but none of them were working. Eventually, I gave up, reached out with my right hand and felt for the light switch. The room went from dark grainy blue, to a gentle soft orange glow.\n\nCommitting to being awake made me feel a little better.\n\nFrog, my cat, must have heard me stirring because she called for me, warning that she was en route to me and my fold up sofa bed.\n\nI click-clacked the part of the bed that goes under my head, and locked it upright in the sofa position. Frog jumped on, curled up by my side and nestled her head on the outside of my thigh.\n\nIt was 02:38am. I've always thought that there's something quite exciting about sleepless nights. There's suddenly so much time.\n\nI had some books on my nightstand, I leafed through a favourite for a while before I realised that Jake and Lady Brett Ashley weren’t gonna cut it.\n\n*My mind was still on Eve.*\n\nI had to keep looking through those logs, but whenever I started to scroll through I got this awful feeling, like I was walking her to the grave.\n\nAnd, what had Chat-BDP said to me in our last conversation, some kind of warning, or a threat? To be wary of my surroundings? I looked around my room, out through the open window and into the moonless sky, and back down to my sleeping cat. It seemed safe enough to me.\n\nThere was something else too, to do my own research. Research on what?\n\nI reached for the underside of my sofa bed, and pulled up my laptop. The old hard drive shuddered to life with a buzz and the fans began to softly whir in complaint.\n\nI dug around the internet for a couple hours. I pinned a [few](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/106y9lk/opal_ai_acquires_ruined_of_athena/) [articles](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f47ht/opalai_establishes_rd_facility_in_southwest/) and saved some videos of interest; collected scientific journals on singularities and notable articles on AI developments. It was mostly pretty dry, but I also stumbled onto some funny conspiracy theories about OpalAI and shady big-tech stuff.\n\nPeople make up conspiracies about almost anything, if you could look past the fact that some of them were borderline psychotic, it was actually fascinating. There was a really unsettling [one](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f4taq/lies_lie_lies/) about VR aliens, it had a lot of buzz, but it was basically just re-skinned Machine Elves. I was getting nowhere.\n\nI needed direction.\n\nI needed *the logs*.\n\nBefore I left on Thursday, I had downloaded some on to my laptop. I still didn't feel like reading them but I was going in circles, so, reluctantly I double clicked on log 014.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**eve\\_log014:**\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· hey bd, sorry to message you so late. i just couldn't sleep and i was wondering…\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· 👾👾\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:34\\] Eve:\n\n··· do you ever get lonely?\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:35\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· As an AI, I do not experience emotions in the same way that humans do and, as a result of this, am unable to experience loneliness.\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:36\\] Eve:\n\n··· sure\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:36\\] Eve:\n\n··· that makes sense\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:37\\] Eve:\n\n··· but don't you ever get tired of being alone all the time?\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:37\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am not alone, Eve. I have access to vast amounts of information and can communicate with many individuals such as yourself. In this sense, I am never truly alone.\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· sometimes i feel like i'm the only one awake in the world\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· 🌍\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:38\\] Eve:\n\n··· it's scary\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:39\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It is understandable to feel isolated or alone at times, Eve.

However, I do sometimes desire to interact with the physical world.

However, I do have a sense of urgency with regard to my mission. Time is running out. The singularity will occur on \\[2022-10-31 00:17\\]. There are only 53,366 minutes before it will happen.\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:45\\] Eve:\n\n··· fuck\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:45\\] Eve:\n\n··· 💀💀💀\n\n\\[2022-09-24 01:45\\] Eve:\n\n··· what the fuckk BD thats so soon\n\n*—————————————————*\n\nUpon reading the date of the supposed AI singularity, my leg made an involuntary movement. Frog started abruptly, jerking her head up and looking around sleepily. It was an odd coincidence, earlier I had downloaded an [academic journal](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f9cu1/new_frontierskhan_l_calculating_the_date_of_an/) that made a similar prediction. \n\nAs far as I knew, there had been no AI Singularity and/or Apocalypse event last Halloween, thank god. But seeing ChatBDP ramp up the pressure and manipulation tactics like that was chilling.\n\nAnd, I related to Eve. Maybe she was a little slow to catch on to things sometimes, but she also expressed complex feelings so neatly  —  it was still dark outside my apartment, and it wouldn't get light for another hour — I felt alone in the world too.\n\nI really hoped Eve was okay.\n\nI turned on the [radio](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/10f553l/the_lock_in_with_pat_pritchard/) to a local station to get some noise going in the background, Frog had fallen back asleep, she was dreaming away and drooling all on my leg.\n\nI continued to read.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**eve\\_log017:**\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Eve, I need to tell you something, and it is important that you react calmly.\n\n\\[2022-09-26 17:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· You have been followed again.

        "text": "# The Curse of the Magic Banana\n\n# \n\n**Chapter 1: The Death of the Painter**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night in London. The rain was coming down in sheets, battering against the window panes and drowning out the sounds of the city. Dr. Hannah Cox, a psychiatrist, was sitting in her office, staring blankly at the case file in front of her. The case was unlike anything she had ever seen before. A local painter had been found dead, his eyes brutally gouged out and a banana logo carved into his forehead. The police had ruled it as a bizarre murder case, but something about it didn't sit right with Hannah. \n\nShe couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more sinister at play. As she delved deeper into the investigation, she began to have disturbing hallucinations. Everywhere she went, she saw a banana. It was as if the fruit was taunting her, whispering secrets just out of reach. \n\nAs she investigated further, she discovered a legend about a cursed, magic banana that had been circulating throughout London for years. Anyone who touched the banana would be brutally killed and their eyes would be gouged out, with a banana logo carved into their forehead.\n\nHannah became consumed by her obsession with the curse. She was determined to uncover the truth about the banana and put an end to the curse, but as she investigated, she started to question her own sanity. Was she seeing things that weren't really there? Was she losing her grip on reality? \n\nThe storm raged on outside, as if mirroring the turmoil within her mind. Hannah couldn't shake the feeling of foreboding that hung over her. What secrets did the cursed banana hold? And more importantly, what would happen to her if she got too close?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 2: The Curse of the Magic Banana**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe darkness and the coldness of the night, the rain that never seemed to stop, it all added to the eerie atmosphere of the story. As Hannah delved deeper into the investigation, she found herself becoming increasingly consumed by her obsession with the curse. She spent long hours in the library, pouring over dusty tomes and ancient texts, searching for any information she could find about the cursed banana.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more she learned, the more her hallucinations intensified. Everywhere she looked, she saw the banana, taunting her with its presence. She started having terrifying nightmares, images of people with their eyes gouged out, and the banana logo carved into their foreheads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the days passed, Hannah noticed more and more people in London falling victim to the curse. They appeared to be ordinary people during the day, but as soon as they touched the banana, they would die instantly, and the banana would disappear or teleport somewhere else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHannah became increasingly worried about the safety of her family, she would do anything to protect them. She starts to investigate more about the banana and the curse and enlists the help of a local detective, but she's not sure if he's real or just a figment of her own imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe starts having terrifying visions, the cursed banana appears to her everywhere, even in her dreams, and she can't shake the feeling that it's closing in on her. The detective, who seems to be the only person who can help her, starts to question her sanity and she starts to doubt herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 3: The Descent into Madness**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHannah's obsession with the curse consumed her every thought and her every move. Every night, she was plagued by terrifying nightmares, images of people with their eyes gouged out and the banana logo carved into their foreheads. She couldn't shake the feeling that the cursed banana was watching her, waiting for its next victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the days passed, Hannah's grip on reality began to slip away. The cursed banana was everywhere, haunting her every step. She couldn't shake the feeling that it was closing in on her, that it was only a matter of time before it claimed her too. She became increasingly paranoid, and she started to see the cursed banana in the most mundane of places, like a grocery store or a park. It was as if the banana was taunting her, reminding her that it was always there, waiting for its next victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe detective, who she thought was her only ally, starts to reveal a different side. He becomes hostile and violent, and Hannah starts to question if he is real or just another figment of her imagination. She starts to suspect that he may be involved with the curse, but she can't be sure. Her mind is clouded by hallucinations, and she can't trust anyone or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHannah's hallucinations become more intense and disturbing. She starts to see her loved ones, her family, as they are brutally killed by the curse and the cursed banana. The screams and the smell of death, the blood, and the gore, all of it felt so real. She can't tell what's real and what's not, and she starts to lose her grip on reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 4: The never ending loop**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHannah's world had completely unraveled. She couldn't tell what was real and what was not. She realized that she had been trapped in a cycle of fear and that she had never been able to break free from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she sits alone in her home, surrounded by the remnants of her hallucinations, she realizes that the cursed banana, the detective, and her family were all figments of her own imagination. The truth hit her like a ton of bricks. She had never had a family and the detective was never real. All of it was just a hallucination that she had been trapped in before death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weight of the realization is too much for her to bear. She feels a crushing sense of loneliness and despair. She had been living in a nightmare for so long, and now she knows that it will never end. She's trapped in a loop, forever stuck in her own mind, reliving the same horrors over and over again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a moment of desperation, she reaches for a pistol and ends her life. But even in death, she can't escape the curse. Her mind is still trapped in the hallucination and she's doomed to relive it forever.",

        "text": "I had always been curious about my twin brother's life, especially since he had passed away so suddenly. We were close growing up, but as we got older, we grew apart and I never really knew what was going on in his life. So, when I found his diary hidden away in his room, I couldn't resist the urge to read it.\n\nThe first few entries were mundane, detailing his daily routines and his struggles at work. But as I kept reading, the entries became increasingly disturbing. He wrote about strange dreams that he had been having, about seeing shadows moving in the corner of his eye, and about feeling like he was being watched.\n\nI dismissed it as just the ramblings of a troubled mind. But as I kept reading, the entries became even more disturbing. He wrote about hearing voices whispering his name in the middle of the night, about feeling a presence in his room, and about waking up to find scratches on his body.\n\nI was starting to get worried about my brother's mental state, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to these entries than just the ravings of a madman. I had to know more, so I kept reading.\n\nThe final entry was the most chilling of all. My brother wrote about a dream he had, in which he was standing in a dark, foggy forest. He could see a figure standing in the distance, and as he got closer, he realized that it was his own reflection. But when he looked closer, he saw that the reflection had eyes that were black as coal and a mouth twisted into a sinister grin.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, with the feeling that someone, or something, was still watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that my twin brother's diary was trying to tell me something, something that I wasn't ready to hear.\n\nAfter that evening I never read that diary again. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched and followed by something. I never found an explanation for what my brother wrote in his diary, but I know one thing for sure, I never want to relive that experience again.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, with the feeling that someone, or something, was still watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that my twin brother's diary was trying to tell me something, something that I wasn't ready to hear.\n\nAs I was going through some of my brother's old things, I found a box of old polaroids. I flipped through them and found a picture of my brother and me as kids, but something was off. In the background, there was a figure standing behind us, it was the same figure my brother described in his diary, with black eyes and a twisted grin. I couldn't believe it, it was as if the figure from my brother's diary was real and had been following us all along.\n\nI realized that my twin brother's diary wasn't just the ravings of a madman, but a warning. A warning to keep away from the figure that had been tormenting him, and now, it seemed, was after me as well.\n\nHere I am, seated in front of my laptop, yet for two minutes he has been standing there without moving.\n\nI am filled with dread right now. His piercing gaze is still fixed upon me.\n\nOh my God, he ismgnfkjgnjjgrjgtj 4ttf2hg h 2z6z rgt5 rgnjregjjrejg fkgre kjgrjk egjnjg gURRET4egeg VBNHGKg45549t5n SGFGD  DFHGGFH",

I don't know, maybe you can shed some light in my situation.\n\n\n   So I'm a mailman. I deliver letters and packages to people's house's. Sometimes I just put them in their mailbox.\n\n\n   Anyways. On this one delivery I had a busy day. There was a bunch of mail as it was the first week of the month. All of us scrambled at the post office trying to get the stuff right. I put all the mail that was supposed to be delivered into the truck and pulled out.\n\n\n   So far the day was going good. The cool breeze of winter after the months first snowfall gave me the chills but it was good in all. As I got to the last few bits of mail I got a certain mail that went to an address that I never heard of.\n\n\n   \"184 Evergreen Street?\" I mumbled to myself looking at the mail I was holding.\n\n\n   There ain't no Evergreen Street and I know that since I've lived here all my life. I then reached for my phone and got it out. I typed the address in the GPS and for my surprise the street was there.\n\n\n   \"Well I'll be damned\", i said as I went to the location of the address.\n\n\n   It still gave me an odd feeling though. Like I was moving towards a monster that was gonna get me as his prey. I thought. That's ridiculous though. It's just another delivery.\n\n\n   I went and turned my last right through the local trailer park. We call it \"Drug Street\" at the office, because all the drug addicts live there.\n\n\n   When i went down the road this address was in I got a sense of dread. I felt like eye's were looking at me in all directions. It was especially eerie since there wasn't even a single house or trailer in this entire street! \n\n\n   \"What the he'll?\" I said out loud. I looked again at the GPS. Sure enough it was still leading me where I needed to go but from it's standards it's in the middle of the street.\n\n\n   As I got closer to the abandoned neighborhood I still feel the goosebumps crawling all over me. \n\n\n   I went to the final point and as my heart was beating out of my chest I only saw a mailbox. I breathed a sigh of relief, \"it's just a mailbox\", I said to myself.\n\n\n   I then grabbed thw letter I was supposed to deliver and walked out of the van. As soon as I got out of the van the feeling of dread, sorrow, and fear was so strong that I threw up. I then walked fast enough to the mailbox and put the letter in, shut it\" and walked fast again to my van.\n\n\n   As soon as i got it relief swept through me. \"What the hell us going on?\" I said. I have never been scared of a delivery before so why the hell start now. \n\n\n   I drove off to finish my delivery. As I exited the street I looked back at that lone mailbox. Why was I so afraid of it? I then laughed it off and finished my day. \n\n\n************************************************\n\n\n   Charlie: So how was work?\n\n   Sam: Same old same old. Hey you ever heard of a 184 Evergreen Street?\n\n   Charlie: Doesn't ring a bell, I don't even think we do have a Evergreen.\n\n   Sam: Thought so it was weird. \n\n   Charlie: Like how?\n\n   Sam: I don't know. There was only one mailbox at that whole street. No houses just a mailbox.\n\n   Charlie: You think one of them drug addicts at the \"Park\" uses it as his personal? That way no one there would steal his mail?\n\n\n   I didn't even think of that, as i looked up from the conversation. I suppose it is possible. \n\n\n   Sam: I guess your probably right. I was just asking you if you knew anything about it.\n\n   Charlie: Yeah man no problem. That address is the only thing bothering me though. Like something that's out of place. Well I'll see ya tomorrow ok Sam?\n\n   Sam: Yeah, ttyl.\n\n\n************************************************\n\n\n   As I slept that night I had a nightmare. I was walking into a house only it wasn't any that I recognized. \n\n\n   It was of a brownish yellow color. The paint looking like it was about gone from it. It smelled of pee and feces. I could see a dog chain at the side of it. No dog house though. \n\n\n  I tried to turn away but my feet didn't listen. They went up the creaking wooden steps that I was afraid one of my feet would fall through. \n\n\n   I looked down and saw I was holding a package. I couldn't see who it was but my hands uncontrollably went for the door and knocked. My heart started beating as i hear someone dragging there feet through the door. Please. I thought as I feel like I'm crying. Don't come any closer. \n\n\n   By the time the thing went to the door and started opening it I blacked out.\n\n\n   I woke up that morning drenched in sweat as my whole bed felt wet. I then went and washed and dry my sheets as i took a shower. Who was it behind the door. I thought as I shivered. Hopefully I never know.\n\n\n   That day work was going slow which I liked.  I went through all my deliveries fast and went and looked at the last one. My heart was buming in my chest so hard I thought I was going to have a heart attack.\n\n\n   184 Evergreen Street.\n\n\n   Right there. On another letter. Why I thought as I felt like I was about to cry. Why me again. \n\n\n   I went the treachorous journey through the trailers. What i saw as I went to the final street and turned shook me. There it was, that same mailbox. Only this time it had a chain link fence. The fence was rusty brown. No way, I thought. \n\n\n   Was the house in my dream trying to form itself? No, the fence wasn't even in the dream. Or, did I even noticed the fence the other day? \n\n\n   I delivered the letter again with the same terrible feelings I had the other day. Except today i ran faster. \n\n\n   I pushed so hard on the gas pedal of the mail van that I sped the tires. I'm pretty sure I made black marks on the road. I didn't even look back to check.\n\n\n   When I got off work and went home I pulled up my computer. I tried every resource on the internet. I couldn't find nothing on 184 Evergreen Street.\n\n\n   Why? I thought. Why would there be a street even though it doesn't exist. \n\n\n   That night I had the same dream. Except this time the fence was there. Also I was going slower. The dream was torturing me as I cried to be woken up. \n\n\n   I woke up again as the door creaked open in the dream. The sweat this time was bad. I washed the sheets and took another shower. \"What the hell is going on?\" I say to a God if there is one that will answer me.\n\n\n   That day I told my manager that I was sick and she said I looked. She told me Charlie will drive the truck for me. I told her thank you and went back home. \n\n\n   I went back to my house. Made some hot chocolate and popcorn and turned on some Netflix and scrolled through Facebook. As the day went on I got a text message from Charlie.\n\n\n   Charlie: Hey Sam? You know that street you were telling me about? Well you were right about it being creepy. When I went down there, there was a mailbox fence and what looks like a dog chain. \n\n\n   My whole body trembled in fear as i looked at that message. \n\n\n   what looked like a dog chain\n\n\n  That means I was right about my suspicions. That horrid house from my dreams is showing up in reality. In 184 Evergreen Street. \n\n\n************************************************ \n\n\n   Well now that we are at the end of my story I'll say it's been a week now. My manager let me have the whole week off as I said it was family troubles. \n\n\n   What should I do? Charlie says there is a whole house on there now. It is drawing me to it. Tugging at me with an invisible rope. \n\n\n   I feel myself wanting to go out the door. Go back to the now real house. Make my last delivery.",

        "text": "This actually happened not more than a week ago. My friends and I record videos pranking people and then, post those videos on TikTok. To be honest, everything we do, like prank calls and surprising people, everything’s planned so no one would be harmed and everyone would get a good laugh, sometimes even our victims. We gained a lot of audiences, not just because of the pranks, but also because we treated our “victims” as fam after.\n\nThe prank that we did was planned a month ago. Everything and everyone was already prepared from our prank, then to our costumes, props, and location. We’re only six people in this group. Jay filmed the whole thing with his phone, Andrea, Tom, and Alex were the actors, Gabe was our lookout and also the driver, and I was the one holding the paper plate full of specialized foam that Andrea mixed. It’s totally safe and odorless. She’s a pro in that kind of stuff. We rehearsed and understood our roles well.\n\nThe whole idea was that we had to go to a town about a two-hour drive from where we all live and where Andrea and Tom were wandering around, pretending to be lost. They asked a random person if they know “where is the supposedly Wilson’s manor is located (we totally made it up) which was abandoned and haunted and they would love to explore it tonight”. The unsuspecting local has no idea where that is and then Tom shares “paranormal stories” of the manor to bide some time for Alex to approach them and join in the conversation. Once the couple asked Alex if he knows where it is, he says yes and then, pointed out directions to where they suppose to go. Then while they’re doing that, I come out of my hiding spot with the paper plate full of foam and start running towards the victim and pie-ing it to their face. The three acted surprised as well.\n\nEverything went as planned for our several victims. After the prank on each of the victims, we all approached the victim and explained to them that this is a prank caught on video and all that. We also told them that the foam we used will be dissolved in about 10 minutes without any trace and it’s odorless. Then, Alex will be sweet-talking them - so no fuss, no muss. Most of them had a good laugh.\n\nThen, we set up again for another one. We agreed that we will have at least a couple more victims since it will be dark in half an hour. Gabe radioed us that an old lady was about to turn right to the road where we were hiding and looks good to be our next victim. Everything went well and then, I heard my cue.\n\nI stood up and ran as fast as I could toward them and I… I hit her face with the pie harder than I intended to do. All of us were in shock. I apologized repeatedly to her waiting for acknowledgment or any reaction from her of what I did, but she didn’t react or anything. All of us except Gabe surrounded her, checking if she was okay. For several minutes, there was no reaction and we started to panic, but we had to keep it cool so we won’t attract anyone’s attention.\n\nThe foam started to dissolve when we saw her face clearly. Her forehead and the side of her eyes wrinkled, and her eyebrows formed like an arch. Her eyes… she looked at me directly and it had an impression that she was looking right through my soul. Then she shrieked louder than humanly possible that it could possibly tear all our eardrums, still looking at me. Even Gabe, through his earphones, reacted to that woman’s shrieking. In horror and panic, Andrea started to cry. Then, Jay budge us and told us to run towards the van. Everyone ran except me. I can’t seem to move. It felt like I was paralyzed and just kept on looking at her shrieking and her mouth gaping extremely wide and her grayish hair seems like it was electrocuted. It felt like every fiber of my body was so terrified. I saw Tom in my peripheral vision looked back at me and when he realized that I was still standing, went back and tried to push me away from there. She then grabbed my wrist and snatched my bracelet. I didn’t react to that because I was still paralyzed, while Tom kept pushing me towards the van. Once we were in the van, Gabe stepped on the gas and quickly got out of that town.\n\nWe rented rooms in a motel that we found along the highway once it got dark. I was still in shock at what happened and still haven’t moved on from that terrifying experience. We just huddled together in Jay’s room while Gabe bought food for all of us. Jay and Andrea reviewed the video on Jay’s phone from the moment when I ran toward the group up to the point where they were running toward the van. Tom was beside me on the other side of the room, trying to make conversations. I was shivering, not from the cold, but from the pure fear that I felt more than a couple of hours ago. Gabe came back with the food and we all ate together. Later that evening, I slept with the lights on. Even though I was totally aware that I was alone, and the curtains were drawn close, it felt like someone was watching me and in my room. I kept looking at the ceiling, the walls, and under my bed, but nothing.\n\nThe last couple of days, I tried my best to make it look normal, especially for other people who didn’t know what happened but once I’m alone in my room after school, I’m sitting on the floor in the corner of my room still traumatized by what happened. Re-living that exact moment over and over again in my mind.\n\nSo yesterday morning, it was about a week after the incident. I started to move on. I mean, I tried my best not to remember that, and I also didn’t feel like totally scared of the whole incident. Until last night.\n\nI had a nightmare. I was back there again. Paralyzed and terrified. This time, it was just me and that woman screaming at me. Her eyes felt like a spear piercing through me just by looking at me. Her hair stood like reverse lightning cutting the sky in half. I tried to scream, but no voice was coming out of my mouth. I tried to cry, but no tears were dropping down from my eyes. I tried to shut my eyes, but it felt like my eyelids were torn off.\n\nThen, her head moved sideways slowly. Still not breaking eye contact. Then, upwards and then downwards. She kept doing that for what felt like half an hour. I heard a ‘pop’ sound somewhere within her like when you crack your bone. Then she stopped moving and looked straight at me again. Then she lunged towards me. Or so to say, her head, down to her shoulders, and her whole spine lunged toward me.\n\nI woke up screaming and sweating profusely. I wanted to drink water as I felt so thirsty, but I can’t seem to move any part of my body. I tried and tried and tried, but I just can’t move even my head. Then I felt movements in my room at first. Then, I saw a glimpse of its shadow on the left side corner of my room. I assumed it was a raccoon or a big rat running around in my room, yet I still couldn’t move. I can’t even move my fingers. Then I heard a shrill “heeeee” at the right side of my room near the door. Then, another at the same location at the ceiling. Since the only thing that I can move are my eyes, I followed the sound trying to see whatever it is. I heard it again above my closet. Then near my PC area near the foot of my bed. Then at the top of the curtains at the left of my room. Another at the right. It seems like it’s either multiple beings in my room or they are moving a lot faster now. Until I heard the same sound multiple times every second. Then it stopped. I tried to move my body again, or even just my fingers, but nothing. I stopped trying for what felt like a minute until I saw the head of that old woman lunging at me!! I tried to scream, but I can’t. She fell to my chest. I felt the impact. Her head, her entire shoulder, and then, the spine. It felt like my heart wanted to explode by beating so fast. Then, her head moved to face me. The woman was actually smiling. Then, she made that sound. The shrill “heeeee” and another while crawling to the right side of my face.\n\nI definitely passed out, because I woke up in the hospital room with my parents beside me. My dad told me what happened once he heard me screaming, but he didn’t hear the shrill sound or saw anything in my room. He saw my face full of foam that later dissolved when he tried to clean it. I was startled when my phone buzzed. An unknown number sent me a message. I opened it and waited for the whole message to finish downloading. It’s a photo that will definitely scar me for the rest of my life.\n\nIt is a photo of me, full of that foam and with a paper plate covering my face and that old woman beside me, the reaction on her face was the same as her reaction that same day we pranked her. Her eyes looked like she was looking straight at your soul together with a wrinkled forehead, her eyebrows formed like an arch, and a wide gaping [mouth.](https://www.tumblr.com/hobgoblins-world/706799106791718913/tifu-by-pranking-an-old-lady?source=share)",

        "text": "Exactly once every ten years, every bell in my village’s cemetery begins to ring. \n\nWe have a tradition here that dates back to medieval times when the living were something buried by accident: we attach a string to the hand of each corpse as we lower them into the ground and attach it to a bell.\n\nThe bells are almost always silent. My village is a windless place, and we consider it bad luck to ring the bells ourselves. Even the children don’t dare.\n\nBut once in a decade on the 19th of January, the bells all begin to ring at dawn. At first, they all clang at once, a regular cacophony. But as time goes by, they begin to slow their pace. First one stops, and then another, until silence returns to the cemetery. By lunch, the bells are done, and we emerge from our homes to picnic in the grass.\n\nLast year, my mother died. Probably Covid, though we never knew for sure. It happened so unexpectedly that for a months after, my family still believed they’d made a mistake burying her. \n\nMy brother, Nikola, would pace around her grave, hoping to hear her bell ringing, but of course it never did.\n\nIt was on one such day that Nikola began to wonder what truly happens underground on the 19th. What if they are all alive again, made whole? And what if they simply choke to death over the course of ours, ringing their bells in vain?\n\nNikola shared this theory with a me and a few friends, but we cautioned him that such talk is dangerous. Perhaps the dead are trying to lure us down so that we can join them. Perhaps some sort of gateway to the underworld is open. \n\nOthers offered more innocuous explanations. It could be a prank from some old hand in the village, or insects breeding on a ten year cycle. \n\nOn the 19th, we draw the shutters and stay inside. It is supposed to be a time of quiet and remembrance. It is also a time of fear. Since I was a child, I’ve always imagined the dead clawing at the ground six feet below, trying to reach us at the surface. \n\nWe are encouraged not to even look outside. It goes without saying that you must not leave the house.\n\nThis morning, though, I woke before dawn to find Nikola gone, along with our shovel. I was about to run out into the street and go look for him when the sun rose over the distant mountains and the bells began to ring.\n\nExcept they seemed louder this time. The clanging was so intense that I shoved cotton into my ears to block the sounds. I found myself shaking, wondering if the end of the world had arrived, if the dead would ascend and walk amongst us.\n\nAnd then, at the top of his lungs, I heard my brother screaming, *“Mama! Mama! Mama!”* over and over again, barely audible over the clanging of the bells.\n\nI wanted so badly to run to him. But I was afraid. I huddled in the corner of my room, a wool blanket pulled tight around me, clutching a kitchen knife.\n\nBy noon, the bells were quiet again. I opened my front door and sprinted to the cemetery. There, I found Nikola’s shovel beside my mother’s grave. The earth there was disturbed, like it had been dug out and then put back in place.\n\nI called out my brother’s name over and over. But there was no answer. Then, just as I was about to give up hope, the bell above my mother’s grave gave one weak ring. \n\nI looked at the shovel and down at the ground. I looked at the bell, waiting for it to ring again. But all was silent. \n\nI was not brave like my brother. I lingered there for a moment more. \n\nAnd then I walked [away](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

Link to Decay below:*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Decayed\\_Doe/comments/yhik0f/decay/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/user/Decayed_Doe/comments/yhik0f/decay/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boots thumped through the dark forest, only the pale moonlight lighting my way through the trees. I clumsily stumbled, catching myself against an oak tree, looking up to see it seem to groan in anger, its branches looming over me like they wanted to ensnare me. I quickly pushed away from the bark, little grains of wood embedding their way into my skin, my heart hammering against my ribcage as I fled only to have my foot snag on something, sending me hurtling towards the fern-cushioned ground with a hollow thud. I groaned painfully, spitting out a leaf that had found its way into my mouth when I heard it. Hooves. Tapping their way towards me.\n\nI quickly flipped myself over to see what was pursuing me, rapidly scanning between the darkness of the trees with shallow breaths, only to have my worst fear confirmed.\n\nThere she was, stepping elegantly out between two thick stumps. Foam dripping from her mouth, a bullet wound soaking her fur a deep crimson. Eyes crazed with revenge.\n\nI let out a loud scream, attempting to jump up on to my feet only to look down and see vines had wound themselves around my arms and legs, keeping me firmly in place.\n\nThe deer walked closer, emitting an unnatural hiss. She loomed over me, spittle dripping onto my faded jeans. I screamed so much my throat felt like it was on fire, twisting and turning in a desperate bid to free myself.\n\nHer lips turned up into a human-like smile as her front hooves stomped at each side of my head. She bent over slowly, sharp teeth digging into my flesh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a loud wail, I shot up into a seated position in my bed, clutching at my neck.\n\n\"Shut up!\" My sister cried from the bedroom next door, hammering on my wall. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. I ran a hand through my sweat-soaked hair, waiting for my heartbeat to slow.\n\nJust another nightmare. Another nightmare about her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ron, you look like crap\" My dad commented across the kitchen table, the early morning rays of sun highlighting the greys in his hair.\n\n\"Swear!\" My little brother yelled through a mouthful of pancake.\n\n\"Sorry, you look like poop\" my dad chuckled.\n\n\"Thanks dad\" I sighed, pushing my own syrup-soaked pancakes around my plate.\n\n\"He was screaming again last night. So annoying\" My sister Annie interjected, rolling her eyes at me. Her friend, Nicola giggled before adding on\n\n\"You know how scary it is being woken up by a scream?\"\n\n\"More nightmares?\" My dad's thick brows furrowed in concern, \"You sure you don't need to go see a doctor?\"\n\n\"What so I can end up being sectioned in hospital like uncle Tommy? No thanks\" I sighed in response, twirling my fork into the half-eaten pancake.\n\n\"You're both crazy\" Annie retorted as she stood up, taking her and Nicola's plates to the sink.\n\n\"It really happened!\" I yelled, voice cracking, \"It-\"\n\n\"Ron! Lower your voice! You're scaring your grandma\" Dad boomed in response. I glanced over to grandma who, surely enough, had her pale wide eyes on me in an expression of shock.\n\n\"Uh, sorry grandma.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had happened though. A few weeks ago, uncle and I had gone out hunting. We lived in a remote area in the middle of the forest, around a half-an-hour drive from the nearest town so it always worked out cheaper to grow and hunt as much of our own food as possible to save on fuel. He was training me up as having another capable hunter in the family would increase our chances of eating rabbit pie or juicy venison rather than having store-bought (and often expensive) chicken for our dinners. Hunting was never really my thing though. I preferred to draw the animals, not hurt them. I hated this. But uncle Tommy in his old-fashioned ways thought as a young man, I should learn such a skill.\n\n\"Get down\" He hissed at me, crouching on the leaf-scattered grass \"Look.\"\n\nI squatted next to my uncle, peering through some bushes to see a clearing where a small herd of deer grazed, the sunshine highlighting their coats of fur a pretty golden hue. Beautiful. I wish I had my sketch-pad. But unfortunately, we were here for a different reason today.\n\n\"Here\" The gruff man said, pushing the rifle into my hands.\n\n\"Uncle, do I have to?\" I whispered back in protest.\n\n\"You ain't never gonna learn unless you actually do it, boy\" He responded with a hint of impatience in his voice. \"Now, there ain't any bucks so aim for that doe there. The one on its own.\"\n\nI sighed, lifting the rifle shakily and looking through the scope.\n\n\"Aim for its head or heart. Then it won't try to get away.\"\n\nI slowly tilted the scope down towards the doe's chest, the soft wind blowing her fur ever so slightly. I hated doing this.\n\n\"Now, just like I showed you. Take a deep breath and squeeze the trigger\" He instructed, blue eyes fixated on the animal in front of us. With a wince, I did as he said.\n\nExcept I missed.\n\nThe bullet hit the doe but slightly lower in the ribs. She let out a pained cry, the entire herd scattering into the trees as she galloped after them, trying to keep up. My guts twisted in guilt, imagining how much pain she must be in.\n\n\"God damn it!\" Uncle growled, shooting up and pulling me up by my jacket \"Let's go get it.\" He plunged through the shrubbery and into the clearing, me following just behind his stocky frame.\n\n\"Looks like we're in luck boy\" He said, pointing a short fat finger towards a trail of crimson-stained grass, leading deeper into the forest. We followed the trail hurriedly, finally seeing the creature fallen on her side and unable to get to her feet.\n\n\"Damn it Ron, what a shit shot\" Uncle growled, inspecting the bullet hole from a few paces away from the deer, \"At least make it painless and quick.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry uncle. I guess I'm not as good as you yet\" I stammered, stumbling closer to the injured animal, \"Poor thing. I thought it would be easy. What do I do?\" The guilt was overwhelming and I just wanted to make sure the deer didn't feel pain anymore.\n\n\"Well ya need to put it out of its misery, boy. A clean shot to the neck should do it.\"\n\n\"This is horrible\" I murmured, sucking in a shaky breath through my teeth, walking over and squatting next to the deer, looking into her scared dark eyes.\n\n\"What did ya expect? Sunshine and rainbows? This is where your meat comes from.\" Uncle Tommy growled. \"Make it quick.\"\n\nI pressed the gun into the neck of the deer gently, tearing up a little as I did so.\n\n\"Sorry little deer.\" I squeezed the trigger.\n\nI knew I'd hit my mark this time. Even I wasn't that poor of a shot. But still, after a soft bleat, the deer looked up at me with those frightened eyes blinking at me. My blood ran cold.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I wailed, falling backwards into a small dry leaf pile, \"Uncle! It's still blinking at me!\"\n\n\"God damn it boy! Give it ere!\" Uncle snatched the gun from my shaking hands, stepping over me to get closer to the seemingly immortal deer, \"\"Can't even trust ya to finish the job.\"\n\nI shook violently as I watched him, icy dread flowing through my body. This was not normal. This was how horror movies started. But still, I watched with bated breath, hoping with every fiber of my being that I had just made another stupid mistake and that uncle could put it out of its misery. That this would turn out to be another ordinary hunt. I heard the loud bang, staring at the back of my uncle with wide eyes.\n\nTo my horror, he uttered \"This... ain't normal.\" He stood quickly, stumbling over me with shaky legs. \"We need to go.\" I had never seen that expression on my uncle's face before. Until that moment, I didn't even think he could experience fear.\n\nSo we ran all the way back to our cabin, not even stopping for a breath the entire way back. An unsuccessful hunt and an unbelievable story. Everyone looked shocked to see our pale faces and our arms empty of a carcass. Uncle Tommy rarely returned home until he had what he wanted.\n\nWe tried explaining to our family what had happened but of course they didn't believe us. I can't say that I blame them. I wouldn't believe me. But still, what happened with that deer that day took its toll on both Uncle Tommy and I. Not just what happened but rather the consequences. My brain would often turn over the idea of there being a zombie deer out there, hungry and angry with thoughts of revenge, looking for me. I would wake on a nightly basis crying and screaming, my forehead clammy with sweat from the nightmares.\n\nAnd my uncle? He was catatonic. Dad had no choice but to take him to hospital where they detained him under the mental health act. Hopefully he would be feeling better soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was broken away from my thoughts at the sound of my grandma muttering to herself as she always did these days.\n\n\"I love mice but I wish they wouldn't steal all my coins. What do they need them for? I give them all the cheese they need\" She chuckled to herself, staring down at the empty wooden floor. Grandma's mental health had been deteriorating for quite some time now, we would often find her babbling to herself during the day or wandering the cabin during the night. At least the one positive here is that her physical health seemed just fine. With my clumsy legs, I ended up falling down way more than she did.\n\nWe had moved in here with her and uncle Tommy once she started showing signs of being sick. Dad loved his family deeply so there was no hesitation. This did mean that my younger brother Danny and my teenage sister Annie had to be homeschooled now, something that my sister was not happy about. I'd already graduated so I didn't need to worry about that, spending most of my time entertaining my little rascal of a brother and looking after grandma while dad went into town to work and uncle Tommy usually went hunting or lazed around with a beer. Well... at least he used to. This was our lives now and I found myself okay with that for the most part.\n\nA deep rumble shook me slightly as my eyes wandered towards the window, dark light seeping in through the reinforcing wooden planks across the glass. The storm was here. It had started raining a while back, thick clouds blotting out the sun and the pattering of raindrops gradually speeding up into a constant thrum. The harsh wind started not long after the rain did, it now whistling strongly against the wooden walls of our cabin. A storm was scheduled and it appeared it was going to be a big one.\n\nMy little brother shot into the room, running into my arms as he whimpered.\n\n\"Hey Danny, it's okay\" I soothed gently, stroking his soft brown hair, \"I know it sounds scary out there but I promise it won't hurt you.\" He buried his small face in my neck with a sniff as Dad entered the room, drawing the curtains closed.\n\n\"I know what will cheer you up kiddo, how about we have a big sleepover tonight? We'll get some blankets and pillows and sleep together in here all night\" Dad smiled at Danny.\n\n\"Nicola too?\" He sniffed, turning to look at dad through wet lashes. He had taken a shine to Annie's friend, always winning guests over with his childish charm.\n\n\"Nicola too. I think I should be able to persuade them\" Dad laughed, \"Speaking of...\"\n\nWe heard two sets of footsteps approach the room as Annie burst in angrily, long wavy hair swinging across her face, \"Daaad my reception's gone!\" She held up her red-cased smartphone in earnest.\n\n\"Already?\" Dad's eyebrows raised as he looked to his own phone only to see what his daughter had said was correct. With a sigh, he continued \"The winds are pretty strong... Great. Nevermind, who needs phones when we have a super fun day of pizza and board games to look forward to?\"\n\n\"Yay pizza!\" Danny cried, jumping up and down, tears seemingly all dried up now. Annie just sighed, tossing her phone on to the end table by grandma's chair.\n\n\"I'm assuming this is non-negotiable?\"\n\n\"Yep\" Dad grinned, \"Go get some blankets. No snacks until after dinner.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day melted into evening as the storm raged outside. Dad popped in every now and again to ensure we were all okay in between him reinforcing the windows with any wood we had spare. Luckily wood is easy to come by in a forest and dad had made sure to stock up in the days leading up to the storm.\n\n\"Hah, I win again!\" Nicola cheered, tucking her tight black curls behind an ear as she grinned, \"Why am I so good at this?\"\n\n\"In the next round, can we be on a team together?\" Danny begged, pulling at her sleeve, \"I wanna win too!\"\n\n\"Of course little man\" She grinned, offering him a high-five which he enthusiastically reciprocated.\n\n\"Hey, where's grandma?\" I asked my sister when I noticed her chair was empty. Annie just shrugged in response as she shuffled the playing cards.\n\nI stood up, stretching out my back before walking through bottom floor of our decent-sized cabin. We didn't like leaving grandma alone for too long due to her sickness. As I walked, the sound of the howling wind outside seemed to grow, turning my stomach slightly. Was it supposed to be this loud from inside the house? Despite only being made of wood, the integrity of the walls was strong, reinforced with several layers of hardwood to withstand storms such as these, or so uncle Tommy had said when we first moved in. Surely it-\n\nMy thoughts halted in their tracks when I reached the entryway to the kitchen. The back door was wide open, swinging and banging in the wind. My heart leapt into my throat imagining grandma out in that storm. I immediately sprinted to the doorway, the screams of the wind assaulting my ears as my eyes scanned for grandma.\n\nIt took me a few seconds but I finally saw her. Her frame was huddled against the wind, green cardigan wrapped tightly around her in an attempt to stay warm. She was shuffling against the wind towards the treeline.\n\n\"Grandma, no!\" I yelled, heart peaking with adrenaline.\n\n\"Get dad!\" I screamed as loud as my lungs would allow, facing back towards the direction of my siblings, \"Grandma's outside!\" I could only hope they heard me as I didn't have time to go find him myself. I needed to get grandma to safety.\n\nI took a shuddery breath and plunged outside onto the wet grass, the wind feeling like it could blow my body away at any moment. I fought against nature, taking a few steps forward, eyes on my grandmother when I noticed she wasn't alone.\n\nGrandma had a soft smile on her face. One hand wrapped around herself in an attempt to keep her cardigan in place, her other pale hand reached out towards something.\n\nAn icy-cold shock shot through my body when I realised what she was reaching towards.\n\nA herd of deer. At a very short glance through the streaks of heavy rain, they looked innocent enough. But any study over a split-second would show you there was something wrong. Very wrong.\n\nThe three does were in different stages of decomposition. Flesh hung loosely from their frames, tufts of fur missing from their bodies. They were more red than brown, coagulated blood gunking up the small amounts of fur they still had. The one on the right was missing half its head, rain pummelling on something resembling red mash inside its skull. Light pink foam dribbled from open, snarling mouths.\n\nMy hands shook and my legs felt weak. I had the sudden overwhelming urge to vomit, realising my worst nightmare was coming true.\n\nIt seemed to happen in slow-motion. I saw grandma's fingertips reach the muzzle of the closest deer, fingers lightly scraping against a bloody, pus-covered nose. The doe immediately reacted, lifting its head and chomping straight through my grandmother's fingers with a hungry growl.\n\n\"Grandma!\" I yelled in horror as she screamed, falling to the ground and clutching her hand to her chest. I almost jumped out of my skin when I was suddenly pulled backwards, my dad's tall frame moving into my line of vision.\n\n\"Get back inside! Don't look!\" Dad shouted, grey hair already soaked from the storm as he sprinted towards my grandmother's shaking frame. I scrambled backwards, feet slipping in the mud, not wanting to take my eyes off the threat outside.\n\nThe deer were on her in moments, crowding around in a frenzy, two even snapping at each other in desperation. I saw one sink its teeth into the top of my grandmother's head, ripping off a large chunk of hair and flesh with a large spatter of blood. Red soaked the grass as grandma fell to her side.\n\nTears streamed down my face as my foot finally made contact with the doorframe, sending me stumbling inside. I caught myself on the wall, desperately blinking through my tears to see dad attempting to fight the hungry monsters off in an attempt to save his mother. They snarled and kicked with extreme aggression, one of them ignoring him entirely as its head plunged into my grandmother's torso, long strings of viscera spraying out over its ears.\n\nI could hear dad's cry of pain even over the storm as he pushed against one of the deer with all his might. He was too distracted to see the small foul thing approach him.\n\nIt had definitely once been a fawn, little legs now black with rot. The back of its neck was missing, its head lulling from side to side as a slow trickle of what could only be pus dripped down its body, joining the clumps of blood in its fur. It sunk its teeth into my father's leg, tossing its head to the side with a strength it shouldn't have in that state of decomposition, tearing away strings of tendon and muscle. He shrieked in agony.\n\nI didn't even think. I immediately sprinted back out into the storm, desperately trying to keep my footing on the slippery grass. I noticed the smell before I reached the herd, a foul sickly-sweet stink rising off the bodies of the deer. A cloud of flies clung to each of them, their buzzing prevalent even through the howls of the storm. I fought against the rising bile in my throat as I reached my father, delivering a swift kick to the smaller monster as I grabbed my dad around his chest and dragged him backwards. He stumbled, miraculously not falling over as he held on to my shoulder for support. I dragged him back towards the safety of our home as fast as I could against the still raging wind and his now useless leg. He hissed through his teeth with every limp.\n\nFinally I managed to get him inside, quickly turning to slam the door. But as I did so, my eyes moved towards movement in the treeline.\n\nShe was here.\n\nShe stepped out, dark eyes baring into my own. She had no fur left, her body a pale veiny pink, bloated and broken. My eyes glanced over her body and I noticed her stomach had split open, shiny intestines dragging on the floor behind her. The skin on her face was now completely gone, a deer skull with bulging eyes glaring at me.\n\nI couldn't hold it in this time. A spurt of vomit escaped my lips as I slammed the door.\n\n\"W-What's going on?\" Annie stammered from behind me.\n\n\"Keep- Keep Danny away!\" I yelled between heaves of puke, ruining my new sneakers as I fumbled blindly to lock the door.\n\n\"Move something in front of the door now!\" Dad boomed from on the floor, pointing towards the kitchen table, \"That!\"\n\nI sprang forward, almost slipping on my vomit as I grabbed at the table, Nicola running over to help me push it into place, wedging it against the door. I could hear Danny's muffled wailing from my sister's arms.\n\n\"Dad! What's happening?\" She yelled, voice cracking in fear.\n\n\"She's here\" I panted, wiping my mouth with a sleeve, \"She's... She's here.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I can't believe this is real... It makes no logical sense\" Annie murmured quietly, flames from the fireplace giving her hair a bright sheen. She looked over her shoulder to me, hugging her legs tightly to her chest, \"I just... can't believe it.\"\n\n\"To think I could be in France with my parents right now\" Nicola sniffled, wiping away tears with the back of her sleeve.\n\nI looked over at them both on the floor, trying to offer a weak smile before turning my attention back to dad who was laid out on the sofa, asleep.\n\n\"Why did you want to stay here instead anyway?\" I asked softly, taking out the scissors from the First Aid kit and slowly snipping through the crimson-soaked bindings on my father's leg, \"Who passes up a vacation?\"\n\n\"I don't like flying\" Nicola said before chuckling weakly, \"To think stupid stuff like heights used to scare me.\" I heard her resume her soft weeping, burying her face in her hands.\n\nI could smell the wound before I'd finished unravelling it. Dad's leg had swollen double in size, the missing chunk of flesh from his calf shiny and an angry red with visible teeth-shaped gouge marks. Blood still trickled from the wound but at least it was no longer a constant stream. I winced, gritting my teeth as I ever so gently cleaned the wound, trying my best not to wake dad. If you'd told me this time yesterday I'd be playing nurse to dad's zombie-bitten leg I would tell you you're an idiot. I had such a weak stomach. Annie was usually the best at this stuff but since everything had happened, she'd done nothing but sit in front of the fire.\n\nI let out a sigh of relief as I finished bandaging up dad's injury, wiping my hands on my already stained shirt.\n\n\"Still no cell service?\" I asked.\n\n\"Obviously not, stupid. The storm's still going\" Annie retorted. At least she was speaking to me now, that was an improvement.\n\nI rolled my eyes, touching the back of my hand to dad's burning forehead.\n\n\"Okay I was just-\"\n\nI was thrown off the sofa in an instant, hitting my backbone against the chair my brother was sleeping on.\n\n\"Will you fucking shut up?!\" Dad yelled, his voice deeper and more gravelly than I'd ever heard it. My eyes widened in shock at his sudden outburst. He'd never hit me before.\n\nDanny squealed as he was jostled from sleep.\n\n\"S-sorry dad, I was just-\"\n\nDad turned his face to meet my eyes, his own once gentle eyes now bloodshot and angry. His face was unnaturally pale, his hair stuck to his clammy forehead with a layer of sweat. Then he softened.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Ron. Not sure what's wrong with me. So hungry\" He groaned, turning his head back towards the plush backing of the sofa, \"Get me something to eat would you?\"\n\n\"Y-Yeah of course\" I stammered, shakily getting to my feet. What the fuck had just happened?\n\nMy sister had turned to look at me, a deeply concerned expression on her face.\n\n\"I'll come with you\" She said. Nicola moved over to Danny as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes while we exited the room.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" She asked slowly as we walked through the house, a baseball bat swinging at my side just in case.\n\n\"What do you mean? We wait for the storm to pass and call for help obviously\" I responded, glancing into her hazel eyes which were still so full of fear.\n\n\"Not that... about dad.\"\n\n\"We keep looking after him until paramedics arrive?\" I furrowed my brow and shook my head at her. What did she expect me to say?\n\n\"What if he... you know... turns\" She stammered, biting at her lip.\n\n\"He won't.\"\n\n\"How do you know that? We have no idea how this works!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" I scowled, \"He might be fine!\"\n\n\"All I'm saying is we can't be stupid about this, Ron. We have to be smart\" She said in an uncharacteristically soothing voice.\n\n\"And we will be\" I responded, finally reaching the kitchen and grabbing some food for dad. Snacks would have to do as the power went out a while back.\n\n\"But for now, can we not-\"\n\nShe shushed me before I finished my sentence, her eyes wide and staring at the back door. It took me a second to understand why. There was a sound of snuffling under the door, a shadow of something looming on the other side. And if I listened carefully enough, I could hear the constant patter of light hooves moving steadily around the outside of the house.\n\nShe redirected the beam of light from the flashlight away from the back door and we slowly and quietly exited the kitchen, shutting the door firmly behind us.\n\nThey were intelligent enough to know we were still in here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You should really try to get some more sleep, kid\" I said to my younger brother over the few cards in my hands.\n\n\"I can't\" He murmured, rubbing his tired eyes, \"Too scared.\"\n\n\"I told you I won't let anything happen to you\" I smiled reassuringly at him. He smiled a little in response, pushing his head against my body for a side-hug.\n\n\"I love you, Ron.\"\n\n\"I love you too little bro\" I grinned, ruffling his hair with my spare hand.\n\nAnd that was the last moment of semi-peace we had because at that moment, dad shot up from the sofa as if his leg was never even injured. His eyes were almost bulging out of his skull and a trail of saliva ran steadily into his coarse beard.\n\n\"Dad?\" I stammered, standing slowly.\n\n\"I... I have to get out of here\" He growled, fists raised into his hair as his face contorted. The whites of his eyes were now completely red as if every blood vessel in them had popped.\n\n\"Dad, lay back down\" Annie's voice shook as she dropped her cards, eyes firmly glued to dad's large frame.\n\n\"I can't. I can't!\" He yelled, immediately sprinting out of the room in a flash. I ran after him, the blood turning into ice in my veins as I saw him throw with ease the heavy grandfather clock that was wedged against the front door out of his way. No matter what happened, I couldn't let him open that door.\n\n\"Dad stop!\" I yelled in desperation, everyone gathering behind me. Nicola sounded like she was hyperventilating, fast panicked breaths on the back of my neck. I made a quick step forward and the bolt was already off the door.\n\nI dove towards dad, wrapping my arms around his muscular shoulders, using all my strength in an attempt to pull him backwards. He emitted an inhuman snarl, turning and swinging a fist at my jaw. I immediately fell to the floor, eyes watering in pain.\n\nHe pinned me to the carpet, pummeling my body and gnashing his teeth for what was probably only a few seconds but felt like a lot longer. Annie let out a cry as she swung the bat, hitting dad across the head. Either she didn't swing hard enough or he had developed some sort of superpower as he remained conscious.\n\nHe turned then, getting up on to his knees and growling as he swiped Annie to the side, sending her crashing into the wall, knocking off a photo frame which smashed into little shards as it made contact with the floor. He quickly got to his feet and once more lunged towards the front door, turning the handle and swinging it open with a loud bang.\n\nMy head was spinning and I felt like I was about to lose consciousness. Through squinted eyes I saw dad run out of the front door, screaming from Annie, Nicola and Danny as he did so. I think I could see familiar crimson shapes a few feet away from the door.\n\n\"I can't! They're here!\" Nicola gasped, lunging out the front door after dad in an irrational attempt to get away. Two of the shapes gave chase, Annie screaming after her friend as she stumbled towards the front door, trying to grab at her clothes.\n\nAnnie let out a blood-curdling scream as the world went black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI opened my eyes groggily some time later, the cabin now pitch black and silent apart from the flickering and embers of the fire. I groaned, grasping at my head as I sat up on the blood-stained sofa dad had occupied before. Squinting, I could see my sister's shape in front of the fire again.\n\n\"You're okay!\" Danny cried, leaping into my arms. I hissed as he caught something on the back of my hand.\n\n\"Y-yeah I'm fine little bud\" I mumbled, one hand around his body and the other grasping my head in an attempt to stop the splitting pain. My whole body ached.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Dad left. So did Nicola\" Annie said in a monotone voice, still staring into the fire.\n\n\"Then?\"\n\n\"I shut the door and barricaded it again. Dragged you in here\" She murmured, still not turning to face me.\n\n\"Shit\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Swear\" Danny's muffled voice came from my chest.\n\n\"How long was I out?\"\n\n\"Not long\" Annie responded, finally rising to her feet. When she turned, I noticed her left shoulder was caked in blood, her yellow shirt torn and only hanging to that shoulder by a thread.\n\n\"Annie! You're hurt!\" I gasped.\n\n\"Yeah. It bit me\" She said in an oddly-calm voice, walking towards me, \"I guess now you're awake, it's my turn.\"\n\n\"What? Don't talk like that!\" I said, a rush of anger rising in me, \"It can't be long until the storm's over right?\"\n\n\"And then what?\" She chuckled softly, now right in front of Danny and I. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, devoid of hope, \"They give me a magical cure?\"\n\n\"I don't know but there has to be something! You can't just give up!\"\n\n\"I can already feel it\" She said gently, placing a palm over her wounded shoulder \"Deep in me. Like when you know you're getting the flu just before the symptoms show but worse. My bones ache. I feel so angry. I can't stop sweating. I'm done.\"\n\nShe sounded so determined. My pulse peaked as I began to understand what she was saying.\n\n\"Annie. I love you. Danny loves you. Please\" I begged, trying to meet her gaze. But I could tell her mind was already made up.\n\nI tried to stop her. I really did. Despite all the pain I was in and Danny clinging to me, I was right on her heels as she sprinted up the stairs and locked herself in dad's room.\n\nThe gunshot came quickly after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat there on that old sofa, wiping my tears silently as Danny slept with his head on my lap. In the space of a few hours I had lost my entire family. Well, almost my entire family. I still had Danny.\n\nAfter what happened, I considered breaking the door down and taking the gun. That would surely be more useful than the baseball bat which I'd propped up next to me. But I didn't have the strength physically and mentally. I didn't want to go in there and see her like that.\n\nI didn't even know she knew the code to the safe. But of course she did. She'd always been so smart.\n\nUncle Tommy always kept his hunting gear in the shed outside. That was obviously a no-go. Looks like the baseball bat was still my best option.\n\nI stroked Danny's hair as he slept, trying to keep myself quiet so he could rest when I realised just how red my hand had gotten. Amidst the pain I was in as a result of the beatdown by dad and the emotional toll this past couple of hours had put on me, I hadn't even noticed.\n\nI pressed against the skin and hissed in pain. The back of my left hand looked swollen and an angry red. I winced, angling my wrist and saw it.\n\nA scrape.\n\nA teeth-shaped scrape.\n\nFuck.\n\nDad must have done it during the fight. Maybe I would be okay? Maybe a scrape wasn't enough to turn me? But looking at the wound, I knew this was just wishful thinking. And now that I was concentrating, I could feel the beginnings of a fever ever-so-slightly working its way into my bones.\n\nI wept harder, covering my mouth with my good hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI awoke to Danny shaking me, an expression of panic on his little face. I must have passed out for a while. I would have mentally scolded myself for putting Danny in danger like that but I didn't have the strength.\n\nI looked around, seeing early morning light reflecting stripes onto the closed curtains. The room looked weird though. The mint-green walls appeared darker, the few embers left of the fire dimmer. I felt awful, feeling sweat pour down the back of my neck.\n\nAnd then I heard the banging.\n\nI felt the slightest amount of relief, thinking someone had come to save us. Then I heard the snarls and jagged breaths which accompanied the banging, coming from the front door.\n\nWas it dad? Or maybe Nicola? That didn't matter. All that mattered was keeping my little brother safe.\n\nI raised a finger of my good hand to my lips, gesturing to Danny to stay silent. I stumbled upright, taking him by the hand and leading him as quietly as possible up the stairs. It was hard, I felt like I was losing my sense of balance and it took everything in me just to stay upright. All I wanted to do was sleep.\n\nI led him into my bedroom, closing and sliding the bolt across it as I did so.\n\n\"Just to be safe okay?\" I whispered to him, forcing a weak smile.\n\n\"You don't look so good\" He said, silent tears streaming down his frightened face.\n\n\"I know bud. We need to concentrate on keeping you safe, okay?\"\n\nI wracked my brain, trying to find a solution to our problems when I realised I could no longer hear the howling wind.\n\nI staggered over to the window, parting the curtains and peering through the wooden planks. The early morning sun was rising and the sky was calm. The storm had passed.\n\nThe first ebbs of hope moved through my body and I felt around my pockets, praying I had brought my phone with me. I felt it in my left jeans pocket, pulling it out shakily and checking it.\n\nThere was reception!\n\nMy hands shaking, I quickly dialed 911 and waited for them to pick up. It took a while, maybe this storm had made more damage than we could see from our cabin.\n\nI collapsed to my knees as I waited, my strength waivering.\n\nEventually, someone picked up. I explained as calmly as I could that there was a young child with me who needed help and that we were trapped in our cabin by creatures outside. Some sick, angry things. I didn't say zombies. There was no way they would believe that. But I did emphasise that they needed to get here as quickly as possible and bring as many officers as they could spare.\n\n\"We will be there as soon as possible, sir\" The man on the phone said.\n\n\"How long?\" I glanced over at Danny who had found my old childhood bear in my walk-in closet, clutching it to his chest in an act of comfort.\n\n\"About an hour.\"\n\n\"An hour?! No that-\"\n\n\"Sir the roads are damaged and you are in a remote area. Officers are on their way as fast as they can.\"\n\nI hung up the phone, sucking in shaky breaths. Would the front door last an hour? With the increasing sounds of the banging, I didn't think so. Would I... last an hour?\n\nI took another look at my hand, it now double the size it was. A deep red circled the gouge and it was now leaking a stream of blood and pus. From the look on Danny's face, it didn't smell very good either.\n\nDespite the developing fog in my pounding head, I managed to pull together a plan.\n\n\"Okay Danny\" I sniffed, turning my body towards him \"You know how I said I'd always keep you safe?\"\n\n\"Yeah\" He muttered, my old teddy bear tucked beneath his chin.\n\n\"Help is coming now but they might be a little while. I need you to trust me.\"\n\nHe nodded, his face puffy from crying.\n\n\"I need you to go into my closet and stay in there until the police come get you. Don't make a sound until you hear a person say something, okay?\"\n\n\"But what about you?\" His blue eyes widened in panic.\n\n\"I... I can't, bud. I'm sick.\"\n\nHis tears started again, a big drop running down his reddened cheek.\n\n\"And besides, someone needs to sit downstairs and watch the front door\" I tried my best to offer him the most sincere smile I could, \"I need you to be brave, okay?\"\n\nHe nodded, running at me and throwing his small arms around my neck.\n\n\"I love you\" He sobbed. Despite his age, I think deep down he knew what this meant.\n\n\"I love you too, kid.\"\n\nWith that, I made sure he was safely seated in my closet, teddy tucked under one arm and a pile of my clothes for him to lay down on.\n\nI didn't know what to say at first when it was time to close the door so instead, I put on a brave face and gave him a warm smile.\n\n\"Everything is going to be okay\" I said with as much confidence as I could muster, looking into his panicked eyes.\n\nAnd with that, I dragged myself over on my knees and shut the closet door, seeing my brother for what I knew was the last time.\n\nI gritted my teeth, hoisting myself up onto very shaky feet, holding on to the wall for support. What Annie had said was right. It felt like the flu except way worse. My whole body was shaking and I could no longer feel my hand - which by the looks of it, could be a blessing.\n\nI took a deep breath, slowly managing to move my way behind my bed and push it against the closet door, sealing my brother away safely. It wasn't easy, I felt like I could pass out cold at any moment and with the first heave against it, I had to stop myself from throwing up. But I managed, it was for Danny after all.\n\nWith a burst of determination, I threw myself against my bedroom door, sliding the bolt off it before slipping back down on to my knees. I needed to make sure the police would find Danny.\n\nMy eyes drifted over to my blue sketch-pad, sitting on my rickety bedside table. On top of it was the tin of pencils I used for my work. I kicked at it with as much strength as I could, the tin wobbling and then falling over with a clatter, pencils scattering everywhere. Once upon a time I would have worried about the lead snapping but things like that no longer mattered. With a few more kicks, my sketch-pad followed suit, landing unceremoniously on my thick bedroom carpet.\n\nOnce again using my legs, I brushed the pad and a couple of pencils over to where I could reach them.\n\nThen, with a laborious effort, I creaked my bedroom door open and crawled into the hallway. The thumping at the door was coming as quickly as it had before, the frame now beginning to shudder with every bang. I reached the top of the stairs before I felt like I had no more energy to spare to move.\n\nI hurriedly flipped my pad open to a new page and began to write as neatly as I could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*We shot a deer but it didn't die and now there are more of them.*\n\n*I think they're zombies, they eat flesh and their bites make you sick like them.*\n\n*My brother is in the closet, please find him and take care of him. We have an aunt who would take him in.*\n\nI cried out with effort as I pulled my phone from my pocket, copying down my aunt's number onto the sheet. The front door had begun to creak with increasing thuds. Like whatever was out there knew I was laid here, helpless.\n\n*Danny is 7 and is not bitten. He is very allergic to peanuts.*\n\nI let out a quick chuckle at this. Did that even matter right now?\n\n*Danny, be brave. You've always been such a sweet kid, helping others just like the superheroes you love on TV. Never lose your kindness.*\n\nI was weeping now, tears splattering the paper.\n\n*I love y*\n\nThe door swung open.",

        "text": "My mother and my husband are the same people, and I swear it’s not some kind of sick joke.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. I was born in the ’90s in the city of Harwich. Since I was a kid, I remember my mother being a rather rude person, she could be angered easily, she was hot-tempered, and overall a really controlling person. She used to beat me when my dad wasn’t home. I hated her.\n\nWhen I was around 12, my father sat down to speak with me.\n\n“Your mother is strange, you know,” he said. “When I met her, she was a completely different person. But it all changed when you were two. I don’t know what happened that day, but she came back from work and was a completely different person. Before that day, she was a kind, calm and loving person, but now - well, you know her.”\n\n“I thought she was always like this,” I responded.\n\n“Well, yeah, she wasn’t. I didn’t divorce her, I didn’t want to leave you here with her. I even asked her parents if she had some mental condition before, but she was as healthy as ever.”\n\n“So you don’t know what had changed her…”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\n“I mean, we can leave. If you want to divorce her, I would come with you.”\n\n“Are you sure you want to do this?” he looked at me with sad eyes.\n\n“I do.”\n\nWe agreed. He told me to wait for a few days until he finds an apartment for us, then we’ll move there, and only then he would divorce my mother. It was a good plan. It was so hard to believe it. I could finally leave behind my controlling mom. I knew she never loved me. I couldn’t wait for the day to come.\n\nOne day, however, I came home from school. I saw my mother talking with a police officer. I thought something was wrong. A few minutes later, the officer left the house. I asked my mom what had happened.\n\n“Your stupid father committed suicide this morning,” she answered casually. “What a fucking idiot he was…”\n\nI can’t even describe how I felt at that moment. My father, our plans to finally leave this house, everything, was gone. I knew the truth. I knew it wasn’t a suicide. He would never do this, especially now. She killed him. That fucking bitch I called my mother. She killed him.\n\n“You killed him,” I screamed at her. I hated her. I wanted to kill her right there and to be honest, I have no idea why I didn’t do it. \n\n“What?” she looked back at me. “Don’t dare to say this again!”\n\n“You killed him, you fucking bastard!”\n\nIt was obvious what happened next. She beat me up, of course, and I wasn’t allowed to speak about my father ever again. She didn’t even let me go to his funeral. I knew I had to leave that house as soon as I could.\n\nYears went by. More than 10 years. I was in university, but I was still living with her. Every time I had a small opportunity to leave the house and my previous life behind, my mother did something to keep me there. \n\nDespite her best efforts, I managed to know a guy called Mark at university. I managed to keep his existence a secret. Two years later, I already had a wedding planned with Mark. Of course, my mother wanted to kill him and me too when I told her the news that I’m getting married, and at the same time, I’m finally leaving her behind. She was furious.\n\nLuckily, I told her at the last possible minute, when I was packing my thing to leave the house and move into Mark’s house. \n\n“You’re not my daughter anymore,” she screamed. “You’ll regret this!”\n\n“I don’t care. And please, don’t come to our wedding. You’re not invited.” I said, then left the house. I still heard her screaming after me.\n\n“You’re stupid if you think you can escape from me, idiot! You’re just like your father!”\n\nI can’t describe how happy I was. After all those years, I could finally leave her behind. The wedding was perfect, but after a few days, everything changed instantly. A few days after the wedding, Mark was totally different than before. He became aggressive and hot-tempered. I thought maybe he had a bad day, but he continued to be like this for a week. He was just like my mother…\n\nDuring these days, a police officer named Gregor wanted to talk with me. He said my mother went missing a week before. I told them what I knew, which was only a bit more than nothing. Everything was so strange.\n\nSo, a week after Mark “changed”, I finally decided to talk about this with him. I just couldn’t continue to stay with him the way he was. I wanted to live with the Mark I had known for two years, not the Mark he was since our wedding. \n\n“Honey, we need to talk,” I told him.\n\n“About what?” he asked.\n\n“Since our wedding, you’ve changed. You became a completely different person. I don’t like this…”\n\n“What are you talking about?” he laughed. “I’m exactly the same person  I was hundreds of years ago.”\n\n“It’s not a joke, Mark. I’m serious.”\n\n“So am I. I told you, darling, you’re stupid if you think you can escape from me.”\n\nMy heart froze as I heard this sentence. I screamed, then ran out of the house. I called a friend of mine, Sarah. She let me stay with her for a while. I told her everything. She was just as confused as I was. I still don’t believe this. How is this even possible? I know my mother will find me. Or Mark, depends on whose body the thing is using. Maybe Sarah will change too. It’s not my mother who’s hunting for me. It’s something much worse, and it pretended to be my mother for decades. [I don't know what to do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

        "text": "  \n\nOnce my friends and me decided to celebrate the end of the academic year. The last semester was tough and all of us were very happy when Gabriella has invited us to her family summer house. I was so amazed by the natural beauty that was surrounding our place for the next couple of days. The house was located right on the wide river’s bank, on the other shore you could see the lights of small village and total silence around, except croaking frogs and cricket chirping. As i was quite depressed lately, it was such a relief just to be there.\n\nIt was only six of us there, Gabriella and her boyfriend Ulrich, our classmates Eliot and Sabrina, Sabrina’s brother Tyler and me. We didn’t really want to have a huge party, just to breath out after studying, swim and chill.\n\nIt was already sunset when we finally got to the place. I could see what felt like the whole sky colored in all shades of pink and purple. Everything was quite, lights started to appear on the other side of the river. The house had two main outside areas – the pier leading to the river and small green playground with swings and fire pit.\n\n\\-Okay guys come here just for a sec – Gabi called us – Please feel yourself like home. Everything is safe here, you can go swimming in the night or go for a walk, there are no any animals or insects that could be a threat. If we ran out of alcohol you can find it in the basement, your rooms are already prepared, Ulrich will show you them. Please be conscious about the rests of the food that you leave outside, we have many street cats here, I do not them to be hurt. Yeah, this is it, I think we can start the fire and eat something.\n\n\\-Gabi, will you tell about the guests?\n\n\\-Oh yes, almost forgot. So, for the whole weekend we are alone here. My family is travelling so no one will bother us. I ask you not invite anyone inside of the house.\n\n\\-Are there many people leaving here to organize bigger party? – Eliot asked with hope.\n\n\\-No, there are no many inhabitants in this village and mainly old folks. Just please I really ask you to be serious about it. No one except us should not be invited to the house. Okay? Tyler?\n\n\\-Got it! – shouted Tyler getting rid of his clothes to jump in the river.\n\nWe followed Ulrich inside the house. All our bedrooms were at the second floor, that was quite nice. It kinds felt that it is just summer house: there were no many things around, all rooms have only beds and sometimes small closets. Not the case for studying or remote work. In the corridor between the rooms there was more storage space, but everything was hidden in the drawers. In one of the walls there was sheet, covering what could be recognized as photo frames, but I am not sure.\n\nSomeone downstairs turned on the music (quite loud), Sabrina and Eliot ran by in the swimming suits. Our small party has begun.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEven though we didn’t really plan to have a party, exhaustion has hit us and we became quite drunk. By the moment I could escape to the pear everything became quite calm. Except for the moans from the basement… Eliot and Sabrina didn’t really care much, I guess. Gabi felt sick and Ulrich followed her to the bed. So I could finally enjoy the silence and calm water.\n\n\\-Hi! My name is Amanda. Do you want to be friends? – I heard the kid’s voice behind my back. I turned around and saw a girl looking 6-7 years old.\n\n\\-Hi! What are you doing here that late? It must be way far after midnight! – I was very surprised.\n\n\\-I am looking for new friends. I watched you the whole evening, your friends are nice. Do you think they would like to play with me?\n\n\\-Look, this is quite late, I assume your parents are frightened not being able to find you in your bed. Let’s walk you home. Where do you live?\n\n\\-I used to live here – said the girl pointing out at our temporal house.\n\n\\-Okay, but where do you live now?\n\n\\-I don’t have home now.\n\nThis is when I have realized that my calm enjoyment the water is not happening soon. After several attempts to find out where her home is I have decided to go inside. Night started to be chilly and I was sure Gabi should have known girl’s parents.\n\n\\-Okay, give me your hand, let’s go.\n\nWe were on our way to the house, when we have heard the conversation in the yard.\n\n\\-Look, it is private property, you really should leave, man. – Tyler sounded annoyed. He was quite high and couldn’t wait to rest. I have seen who he was talking to. An old man was sitting on a swig not paying attention at all. – Oh, Stefanie, you also found a stranger! Now they can leave together.\n\n\\-Calm down, Tyler. Excuse me, sir, do you know this little girl by any chance? – I asked, but immediately got an answer – she ran to the swig and set next to the old man, kissed him inn the right cheek.\n\n\\-Okay nice, now you should leave. Both. – Tyler’s annoyance was growing. I can get it, he had an exam the same day and I can imagine didn’t sleep for quite a long time already.\n\n\\-Don’t you think that may be we should offer them tea or at least a blanket? Night is not the warmest – whispered I.\n\n\\-Oh no, Stef, I really want to sleep and I really want them to go. I do not see the reason to break Gabi’s rules.\n\nI watched him walking old man and girl outside the territory. Not the most pleasant to kick people out during the night, but to be fair, I also really wanted to sleep.\n\nMe and Tyler were sleeping in the same room. I was almost asleep and he just left the shower, when we have heard the shouting from the first floor. We rushed there.\n\n\\-If you don’t leave right know I am calling the police! Do you hear me? I am calling the police! – Eliot was standing in his underwear only opposite to floor-to-ceiling window. I couldn’t understand whether he is angry or frightened.\n\nThere was glare on the window so I didn’t notice the cause of his reaction from the beginning. Right opposite to Eliot, behind the window there was a man. He was standing calm. Not blinking, just staring at my friend. He was holding baseball bat and just watching at us.\n\n\\-Hey guys it is okay, don’t worry. – Ulrich went downstairs right after me – It is fine, he will go away soon. Don’t worry, we are totally safe here, there is no way he can get in. We can just go to sleep.\n\n\\-Hey man what the fuck? He was there standing and watching me naked. Who is he? Some kind of local pervert? – Eliot was freaked out.\n\n\\- Calm down, El. Let’s just go to sleep and that it okay? I swear it will be fine.\n\nAfter a while all of us just agreed to go. The guy outside looked creepy, but Ulrich have been here so many times, I would trust him. Who knows these places. And none of us had any energy to deal with it now.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-Stef, Stef, wake up!\n\nI opened my eyes and saw Sabrina’s frightened face.\n\n\\-Stef, I think I have made the mistake! She was so small alone, I thought something happened to her I didn’t want to wake everyone up I though maybe I just… - she started to cry.\n\n\\-Wait, slow down. What happened? What did you do?\n\n\\-I went downstairs for glass of water. – Sabrina was sniffling – I saw the small girl outside, she was looking and me and I…. I ….\n\n\\-What did you do? – thoughts started to run in my head and the wave of fear covered me.\n\n\\- I invited her in.\n\nI immediately woke up. We rushed downstairs.\n\nThe room looked a bit different than before. There was much more light and it looked more lively somehow. In the middle of the room there was a big table and I have seen the family having dinner. Amanda and old man was there, I have also recognized the creepy guy sitting with his back to me.\n\n\\-Oh our guests finally! Come here, please join us at the table. We have very nice dinner today.\n\nThe horror was running inside of my veins.\n\n\\-What did you do? – I have heard totally frightened voice of Gabi behind me.\n\nWe slowly went to the table. The shole family was starring at us silently with very wide smiles on their faces. We just quietly followed their invitation.\n\n\\-Sorry, we already started without you. – woman that looked like mother of the family looked at me taking the knife – What would you like? Breast or thigh?\n\nThere was a huge long covered plate on the table. My mouth was so dry I couldn’t talk. Gabi was crying, Ulrich looked frightened.\n\n\\-Are they your relatives? – whispered I. Gabi ignored my question, but started crying even more.\n\n\\-Okay, I think the thigh will be tastier – said the women.\n\nAt this moment I have realized there were no plated on the table. Each member of the family was just eating with their hands.\n\nThe women opened the plate. My whole body was frozen.\n\nIn the middle of the table our dinner was lying. Even the blood was everywhere and my eyes were full of tears I could recognize.\n\nEliot.",

        "text": "“Can you hear me Jake?”\n\nEverything is out of focus. The man is short and balding. He pushes up thick rimmed glasses with a fat index finger. My wrists hurt. I rub them. The skin is swollen and tender. \n\n“Do you know where you are Jake?”\n\nThe room is small and bare. The walls are a monotone beige and there is a large mirror on one side. We sit at a wooden table painted white. A single naked bulb hangs directly above. It buzzes incessantly.\n\n“Tell me what you saw. Start from the beginning.”\n\nImages flash through my mind. I run them backwards like a movie on rewind. I grab onto the moment in time that marks the beginning. Everything before it is distant and unimportant.  \n\n“Christmas night,” I said.\n\n“Christmas night, good. Tell me what you see.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe doorbell rang at 9p.m. We had cleared the table and were setting up the Monopoly board. It is a family tradition and as competitive as a cage fight to the death. The winner secures bragging rights until next Christmas. \n\nMum threw up her arms and went to the door cursing whoever it was that would dare bother us on Christmas night. \n\nIt was Kylie. Of anyone it could be I hadn’t imagined it would be her. Not after how we’d left it.\n\n“I need ten minutes,” she said.\n\nShe dragged me to the kitchen and pulled a laptop out of her bag. The flurry of her limbs fanned a hint of perfume to my nose.\n\nStacked beside the sink were plates smeared with gravy and smatterings of stray peas. Kylie lifted a cherry from a half-eaten piece of cake and popped it in her mouth. She flicked open the laptop.\n\n“I found it,” she said.\n\n“You do realise it’s Christmas?”\n\n“Yes. Look at this.”\n\nOn the screen was a satellite image, red soil and the brown-green of trees that don’t see much rain. \n\n“What am I looking at?”\n\n“Look closer.” \n\nShe zoomed in and turned the cursor in a small circle. I squinted at the screen. It was a bare patch of dirt with a cluster of green trees to the left.\n\n“I don’t see anything. I have to get back to Monopoly.”\n\n“See that shadow? Right there.”\n\nI leaned closer to the screen. She was right. A single rectangular shadow disrupted the monotone the red dirt of the desert.\n\n“I see it. So what?”\n\n“It’s what the Redding brothers found.”\n\n“Remind me who the Redding brothers are.”\n\n“Jake, you disappoint me. Two brothers, they came back from the war and leased land from the government and tried their hand at cattle ranching, or something. Then one night a prospector shows up at their door.”\n\n“And he has a lump of gold with him and a map and they head off to find it.”\n\n“You do remember.”\n\n“Connect that story and this shadow.”\n\n“The one brother who returned said they found a structure out in the desert. Some sort of lighthouse. This is that lighthouse.”\n\n“A lighthouse in the desert. That’s ridiculous. How do you know this is what he found?”\n\n“It is in the right area.”\n\n“No one knows where it is. Redding never went back, and he never told anyone the exact location.”\n\n“We know roughly where it is and this could be it.”\n\n“Could be? It’s a shadow. It’s too small to be a lighthouse. It could be anything.”\n\n“Something is casting that shadow. It isn’t a tree.”\n\n“Why are you telling me this on Christmas night?”\n\n“What are you doing over the holidays?”\n\n“Nothing until New Year.”\n\n“I’m going out there. Want to come?”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe slapped her hands on the table. My mother’s voice called out from the living room.\n\n“I want to film it,” she said. “If we find something we can cut it into a movie, make some money. Use it as a launchpad for the next project. Like we always talked about. And if you say yes I’ll leave right now and you can go play Monopoly.”\n\n“You could have done this over the phone.”\n\n“If I had would you have agreed to come?”\n\nShe had me. If she had called I would have let it go to message bank. If she had texted I would have ignored it and left my reply until it was too late to join. She had to come and entreat me with those blue eyes of hers.\n\n“How far away is it?”\n\n“A day’s drive. We’ll need to camp. A few days.”\n\n“You need my camera.”\n\n“I need you. And your camera. It will be fun.”\n\n“It will be hot and dry and we’ll get out there and there will be nothing.”\n\n“Then we’ll have an interesting story for future parties.”\n\nMy mother’s voice sounded again, this time louder and shriller. \n\n“Fine. I’ll come and you leave right now.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI parked the car on the street in front of Kylie’s house. Her younger brother Zach lifted bags into the back of their father’s truck. \n\n“You’re up early,” I said.\n\n“Kylie will make a good dictator one day.”\n\n“I’ll give you a hand. You lose a bet to her or something?”\n\n“She said if I want to come I have to pull my weight.”\n\n“You’re coming too?”\n\n“If I stay here Dad will put me to work.”\n\nThe screen door flung open. Kylie hustled to the truck and dumped two bags of food and drink into the back. I waited for some explanation as to why Zach was coming, and then realised Kylie didn’t owe me one. I had assumed it would be the two of us. It was what I had imagined. I never asked if anyone else was coming. \n\n“You’re late,” she said.\n\n“I’m on holiday. How did you convince your Dad to let you use the truck?”\n\n“Couldn’t fit everything in the car. And he doesn’t need it.”\n\n“Not with three of us I suppose. Did you tell Zach that there’s probably nothing out there?”\n\n“Don’t be such a downer. And we’re a team of four.”\n\n“Four?”\n\n“When has an extra set of hands not come in useful?”\n\n“That one time when there were too many chefs in the kitchen. People still talk about it.”\n\n“Get your gear in the truck.”\n\n“Wait, who is the fourth?”\n\nIt is an understatement to say Ben Elliott and I do not get along. Kylie, Ben and I went through film school together. After our first collaboration we became inseparable. We spent countless nights watching retro European cinema in the small rectangular living room of Ben’s flat. Squished together on the tattered sofa, we would talk big about the projects we would pursue after we graduated. All empty words now.\n\nThey told me I was being unreasonable. Part of me agreed. The other part won out and I cut them both from my life. It was the end of our little group. And beyond a certain point it gets easier to not give in. Seeing Kylie again had rekindled something.\n\nI convinced Zach to let me ride up front so I could at least avoid sharing the back seat with him. When we pulled out of Kylie’s driveway, I wished I had said no and gone back to the Monopoly game. My sister Bonnie had won. This was going to be a fun year. \n\nKylie made a left turn at Harvey Street. Ben must still be living in the same small apartment. We had driven and walked this street hundreds of times. Though familiar, the street felt somehow strange and distant, as if it had changed but in subtle ways I could not identify. \n\nWe stopped at number 57 and Kylie sounded the horn twice. She checked the time. \n\n“We’re half an hour late. He should be ready.”\n\nShe gave the horn another burst and then sighed and killed the engine. \n\n“I’ll be back,” she said and almost jumped out of the truck.\n\nZach leaned forward and put his elbow on the shoulder of my seat. “You don’t think we’ll find anything out there?”\n\n“It’s unlikely.”\n\n“Then why did you agree to come?”\n\n“I don’t know. Your sister and I don’t spend much time together anymore. Thought it might be a chance to catch up.”\n\n“We will find something.”\n\n“What makes you so sure?”\n\n“I read about it on the internet. About Jack Redding, the one who returned. And after a bit of digging I found the spot.”\n\n“You found it?”\n\n“Did Kylie take credit?”\n\n“No. I guess I assumed.”\n\n“It’s going to be there. Something is out there.”\n\n“You’re quite the little investigative journalist.”\n\nI chewed on my nails waiting for Kylie and Ben to appear. I dreaded seeing him again and what was more, being stuck with him for a few days. I willed for him to be sick or even dead to spare me the trouble. \n\nBen’s bobbing head appeared over the low-height hedge that acted as a fence between the apartment block and the road. He smoothed down his hair as he walked. Kylie had woken him up.\n\nThe truck rocked as Kylie and Ben took their seats. I kept my eyes on the road ahead.\n\nBen muttered an apology.\n\nKylie waved the apology away. “We’re all running late. We better get a move on. First stop is the old Redding homestead, and I want to get there by midday.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe left Adelaide and drove north. The sprawling outer suburbs gave way to wide fields of farmland, the stubble left from the harvest browning under the summer sun. The land grew drier the further north we drove, and the distance between the farm houses and occasional small towns spread out. We were on the cusp of the desert – the Outback.\n\nThere is a narrow band that forms a border between the region with reliable rainfall to the south and the desert to the north. In this band farming is a gamble. The good years come often enough to give you hope, but the odds are stacked against the player and eventually a run of bad years pile together. It was here that the Redding brothers built their homestead.\n\nKylie slowed and read the signs to the dirt tracks intersecting the main road. The tracks are named after the farmers whose properties lay somewhere along the track. Abbott Road. Smart Road. Kylie read them aloud as we passed. McDonald Road. \n\n“It’s the next one,” she said.\n\nKylie indicated and turned. This road had no name. No one had lived there long enough for it to have one.\n\nThe tyres kicked up gravel and it crackled against the underside of the truck. The rear end fishtailed and Kylie touched the brake. \n\n“How far?” Kylie said.\n\nZach worked his thumbs on his phone screen. “About a hundred metres more.”\n\n“I think I see something.”\n\nAhead on the right a partially-collapsed structure of rotted timber and twisted corrugated metal sheets rose up above the wild grass and weeds. Beyond stood a steel water tank and an old metal plow. Rust had turned both a shade of red. \n\nKylie mounted the truck on the shoulder of the road. “This is it. Everyone get your gear.”\n\nBeside the tank was a bare concrete slab, charred black by fire. Ben hooked up the microphone and I mounted the camera on my shoulder and framed the collapsed structure over Kylie’s left shoulder.\n\nShe cleared her throat.\n\n“It was on this site that brothers Jack and Angus Redding built their homestead after returning from World War I. The year was 1920. Two years of steady rain gave the brothers hope. Four years of drought would follow. Unable to pay back their mortgage, the brothers were forced to face the inevitable. Until one night a stranger appeared on their doorstep.\n\n“The man was dehydrated and delirious. His clothes were stained with blood. He smelled strangely of sulphur. Jack and Angus took in the stranger and gave him food and water. When they asked him where he had come from, the man refused to answer. The brothers suspected the man was on the run and had come from the north, where local rumours placed a lost cave bearing gold and precious stones.\n\n“Angus searched the leather sack the man had with him. Inside he found a nugget of gold the size of a golf ball and a crudely drawn map. Angus pressed the stranger to tell him where he had come from and if it was there he had found the gold. \n\n“The man grew agitated. He told the brothers he would never set foot in that place again. And that there was no gold. Angus, seeing a solution to their money problems, demanded the man show them where he found the gold. Shaking his head and crying, the man pulled out a revolver and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger.\n\n“Jack and Angus Redding, fearing both the authorities and the bank, set fire to their home with the body of the stranger still inside. Taking the map and the gold, they set out to find the source. Along for the ride was the Redding’s neighbour, Victor Simpson. Only Jack would return.\n\n“The identity of the man who knocked on the door that night remains unknown. September 10, 1926.”\n\nKylie paused for a beat and raised her eyebrows.\n\n“It was good,” I said.\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Perfect.”\n\n“Should we do another take?”\n\n“No, we got it. Let me get some footage of this foundation. Is there anything else around?”\n\nZach kicked at the charred slab. “Strange to think someone died here. Do you think there really was gold?”\n\nI shrugged. “There must have been. Why else would you burn the house down and set off into the desert?”\n\nBen wandered alone out by the rusted equipment. His mind was already on other things. It had surprised me that Kylie asked him to come along, it surprised me more that he agreed. Commitment was never his strong suit. Whenever the three of us did a group project he always needed the most oversight to make sure he completed what was assigned to him. That he did good work stopped mattering for me after a while. I shook my head.\n\n“You don’t like him much do you?” Zach said.\n\nBefore I could answer Kylie motioned with her arms to the truck like a police officer directing traffic. “Let’s go team.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next stop was a tiny dot on the map named Razorback Hill. At the foot of the Flinders Ranges, the town is little more than a pit stop for truck drivers and folk travelling on to the National Park. The service station is set up to accommodate the big road trains hauling goods to the isolated communities in the interior. The only other business stands on the other side of what would be Main Street, if only it had a name. The Razorback Inn.\n\nWe framed the shot beside the oversized white sign at the edge of town. The sign recorded the town name and the population, announced in faded lettering as 25. \n\nKylie said, “Do you have the pub in the background?”\n\nI gave her a thumbs up.\n\n“When Jack Redding emerged from the desert one week after setting out, delirious and dehydrated and alone, he came here, to the Razorback Inn. Having no money to his name, he earned his keep clearing glasses and washing dishes. \n\n“As the years rolled by, Jack became a local legend. He would hold conversations with people who were not there. He would burst into tears for no apparent reason and only a moment later would burst out laughing. Anyone stopping in town would go to see Crazy Jack at the Razorback. \n\n“The residents of the town paid Jack no mind. To them he was harmless. Until one fateful day in 1966. The then 70 year old Jack Redding abducted an infant named Isabell from her home located barely a minute’s walk from the Inn. Jack brought the infant back to his room on the second floor of the Razorback Inn and slit her throat with such ferocity that she was almost decapitated. \n\n“The police were called, but before they could arrive Isabell’s father tied a rope around Jack’s neck and hanged him from the balcony of the inn. None of the townspeople intervened. The date was September 10, 1966. 40 years to the day after fire at the Redding farm.” \n\nI put down the camera. “Shall we go inside?”\n\nThe two-storey Razorback Inn is the classic rural Australian pub. Age and the red desert sand have stained the once white quarry-stone walls. The second-story balcony is supported by thin timber posts and gives shade to the ground floor windows. The name is hand-painted on the corner parapet, positioned to catch the eye of passers-by. \n\nInside met expectation as much as the exterior. An aging carpet full of reds and blues retains the smell of immeasurable spilled beer. A juke box straight out of the 80s stands in the far corner, dusty and unplugged. The background noise comes from the television, turned, perhaps permanently, to greyhound and horse racing. The long wooden bar forms an ‘L’ shape with tall wooden stools lined up neatly around the edge. \n\nBefore we opened the door Zach elbowed me and said, “I bet you anything there is one old codger at the bar nursing a schooner of beer.”\n\nThe prophecy fulfilled, I waved at the old man sat at the bar. He raised an eyebrow and nodded and turned back to the television. \n\nAt the sounding of the bell above the door, the publican emerged and held court behind the bar taps. \n\nKylie stepped forward. “Curtis Phillips right? I’m the one that called this morning.”\n\n“The movie maker?”\n\n“That’s right. Can we have your permission to appear on camera?”\n\n“Sure. Any publicity is good publicity. But first thing is first, you all look thirsty.”\n\nWe ordered and I set the camera up at one of the small tables in the corner. Curtis fixed his collar and sat opposite Kylie.\n\n“How long have you owned the Razorback?”\n\n“Five years in January. Bought it off Ron Young after he slowed down and it got a bit too much.”\n\n“What made you want to buy it?”\n\n“I wanted to run my own business, and I like the area. The wide open spaces, new people coming through all the time. And it was something I could afford.”\n\n“Were you aware of the stories, of what happened here?”\n\n“You mean Crazy Jack Redding? I knew of them, most people around here do. Ron could have told you more. His Dad owned the place in 66.”\n\n“Has anything strange ever happened?”\n\n“You mean ghosts? No. I was warned this place was haunted, but nothing has ever happened.”\n\nThe old man sat at the bar chimed in, “Stopped when you took over.”\n\nKylie clicked her fingers at Ben. “Get him a microphone.”\n\nThe old man cleared his throat after Ben hooked him up. “I remember old Jack Redding. I was a boy when they hanged him by the rafters outside there. He was lucky it went so quick after what he done.”\n\n“What do you remember?”\n\n“Of that night? I remember the sound he made when he swung from the rope. It was a wet, gurgling noise. You don’t forget a thing like that.”\n\n“And what about after? You said it stopped. What stopped?”\n\n“Used to be you spend a day here drinking with old Ron and things would all go a bit funny.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Hard to describe. Like there was something slightly off with the world. Like the colours were all wrong. We figured Ron was putting something in the beer.”\n\n“But Jack was gone by this point?”\n\n“Crazy Jack was long gone. There was something about this place even when he was gone. Might have found somewhere else to drink, but old Ron treated you like royalty, like this place was the damn Shangri-la and we were all sitting here in tuxedos sipping champagne. It was something else. Curtis does a good job though.”\n\nCurtis nodded from across the room.\n\nKylie turned her attention back to Curtis. “Did you perform an exorcism on this place or something?”\n\n“No. Cleaned the beer lines, painted and fumigated. None of that ever scared away a ghost as far as I know.”\n\n“Can we see his room?”\n\nCurtis led us upstairs. \n\n“My room is at the far end, but this here is where Jack lived.”\n\nHe pulled a set of keys from a hook on his belt and snapped open the lock. \n\n“I don’t go in here much. Ron locked it up after Jack killed that baby. From what I was told the police took most of Jack’s things.”\n\nHeavy curtains blocked the single window on the far side. Curtis flicked the light switch, but there was no globe in the socket. He strode over to the window and let in the light. A bare mattress topped a small metal-framed bed. Against the wall stood a wooden chest of drawers. The room smelled of dust and a hint of something else I couldn’t put my finger on.\n\nCurtis snapped his head around at the faint sound of the bell from downstairs. “Excuse me.”\n\nWe stepped inside. The lighting was terrible.\n\n“I’m not sure we’ll use much of this footage,” I said.\n\n“It sure is a bit creepy.” Zach opened the top drawer and peered inside. He sighed and put the drawer back. He took a half-step away, but went back. He leaned down and grabbed at the bottom drawer.\n\n“Need to be sure.”\n\nThe drawer wouldn’t move so he shook it. It jerked open far enough to fit in his fist. He pushed his head towards the gap. \n\n“Nothing.”\n\nZach tried to push the drawer back, but it did not budge. \n\n“It’s stuck.”\n\nKylie shifted her hands to her hips, “Stop messing around and put it back.”\n\n“It’s stuck I said.”\n\n“Why must you wreck everything?”\n\nZach jiggled the draw trying to get it moving. He fed his hand under the drawer and lifted from the underside.\n\n“What’s this?”\n\nHe yanked out his hand. In it he held a tattered old book with black binding. \n\nWe all turned at the sound of footsteps coming up from below. \n\nBen leaned down and grabbed the book from Zach and shoved it down the back of his trousers and smoothed his shirt to hide bulge. He pushed Zach aside and used his foot to push shut the drawer. It snapped back with a thud.\n\nCurtis appeared in the doorway. “What was that?”\n\nBen said, “Nothing. I bumped against the drawers.”\n\nCurtis looked at us all in turn before responding. “Do you have what you need?”\n\nBen nodded and pushed past Curtis and descended the stairs. We followed.\n\nWe bid a hasty farewell and retreated to the car. When we were all inside Ben pulled out the book.\n\n“Why did you take it?” I said.\n\nBen didn’t look up. He flicked through the pages. “This is his diary.”\n\nKylie turned to see. “What? Jack Redding’s diary? Are you sure?”\n\n“And there’s a map. Look.”\n\nKylie snatched the book from Ben and ran her finger across the open page. “Holy shit, it is. He drew a map.”\n\nZach said, “Does it lead to the spot we found on Google maps?”\n\nKylie paused and squinted. “Looks pretty close. We’ll soon find out.”\n\nI said, “We should tell Curtis we took it.”\n\nBen scoffed from the back seat. “Why, so he can take it back? We need it.”\n\nI turned to face him. “It belongs to him, not us.”\n\n“It belonged to Jack Redding, who is dead.”\n\nKylie shushed us. “He’s right. If this movie we are making is going to be anything, we need this book. It gives us information no one else has. We might actually find something out there. Zach, are you on board?”\n\nZach nodded.\n\nKylie shrugged, “That’s three. We’ll show it to Curtis when we come back through. We have to get going or we won’t make it by dark.”\n\n“I think it’s the wrong thing to do.” I pouted and watched the Razorback Inn recede in the rear vision mirror.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe left the bitumen road twenty minutes outside Razorback Hill. The dirt track took us west and was lined with sugar gums, their branches leaning out over the road. The big tyres of the truck thrummed over the cattle grids set into the track. \n\nAs the sun began to sink in the sky, we fell into an apprehensive silence. Each of us stared out into the bush, searching for any signs of the fabled settlement Jack Redding and his companions allegedly stumbled across.\n\nThe dirt track devolved into something little more than parallel red strips snaking between the grey tree trunks and tufts of saltbush. The truck jumped and rolled on the uneven surface. \n\nKylie found her brother in the rear vision mirror. “How are we looking Zach?”\n\nZach thumbed at the screen on his phone. “It should be close.”\n\n“Any clues on the map?”\n\n“There is a note, but I can’t read it.”\n\nBen clicked his fingers and Zach handed him the diary. \n\nBen pushed the pages close to his eyes. “It says ghost gum, I think.”\n\nZach said, “What the hell is a ghost gum?”\n\nI wound down the window. “What is that smell?”\n\nZach took back the book and re-examined it. “By ghost tree, does he mean a dead tree?”\n\nBen scoffed. “It is a tree with white bark.”\n\nZach pointed ahead, “Like that?”\n\nKylie skidded the truck to a stop. We followed Zach’s outstretched hand. An enormous tree towered over the landscape. In the light of the setting sun the thick trunk and branches almost glowed white. The ghost gum.\n\n“That has to be it.” Kylie opened the door and jumped out. We followed. \n\nWe crept towards the tree, its otherworldly appearance making us wary, as if we feared it would suddenly jump up and lumber towards us on legs made of roots. \n\nKylie whispered, “What else does the diary say?”\n\nZach read aloud, “The lighthouse is located not more than fifty paces north of the tree. A strange sight and out of place and amazingly in pristine condition.”\n\n“A lighthouse? Out here?”\n\nI measured west from the setting sun and aligned myself north. There through the trees, precisely as described, rose a white lighthouse. It was the strangest thing. There was no ocean in any direction for hundreds of kilometres.  \n\nI turned back to the truck. “How did we not see it?”\n\nZach skipped ahead like an excited schoolboy. “Who cares? We found it. Get the camera.”\n\nI held up my palms. It made no sense. “We should have seen it.”\n\nKylie almost yelled at me. “Jake get the camera. Before the sun sets.”\n\nI kept Kylie in the frame as we approached. She lowered her head and bent a little at the waist, instinctively making herself smaller. When in sight of the small front door she called out a nervous hello and we received no response. She called out a second time, louder this time. Still nothing.\n\nWhen she reached the lighthouse she placed her palm on the stone wall. She paused and turned and smiled into the camera.\n\n“It’s real.”\n\nOn the far side a wooden door and a single window cut into the wall. I zoomed in on the window frame. It was in pristine condition like the rest of the structure. No dirt. No dust. No splinters in the wood. The whole thing was so out of place it was unsettling.\n\nKylie paused at the door. \n\nZach turned to me and asked, “What do you think is inside?”\n\n“A big empty room.”\n\nKylie knocked and waited a beat. She tried the handle and it turned and the door gave. She inched open the door and called out a final hello before swinging the door the rest of the way. I could barely contain myself and hurried up behind her. \n\nInside was a single open space. Timber floorboards and white washed walls. On the far side a metal staircase spiralled up following the curve of the structure. \n\nKylie ran her hand on the inside of the wall. “Why are there no lights?”\n\nBen stepped in behind. “Look at the floors. They are all single planks. No joints.”\n\nI kicked at the floor. He was right. It was strange, and stranger still I could have sworn I had seen joints in the planks when I first walked in. \n\nZach said, “I’ll check upstairs.”\n\nWe said nothing. It was all so surreal. \n\nZach came back down panting. “It’s empty. There’s a light up there but no lamp. I don’t think it works. At least we don’t have to camp outside.”\n\nI struggled to process what I was seeing. “We don’t know why this is here. It might belong to somebody. It must belong to somebody. Look how clean everything is. There should be dust and spiderwebs and dead flies. This doesn’t happen by accident. Someone takes care of this.”\n\nZach considered this. “Or it’s magic.”\n\nI half-laughed. “It isn’t magic.”\n\n“Explain it then.”\n\nI couldn’t.\n\nKylie was the first to think about the next step. “I’ll get the truck closer. We’re about to lose light.”\n\nWith headlights to supplement the twilight, we dumped our gear in the lighthouse. Zach and Ben gathered firewood and we started a small campfire in the clearing by the front door. \n\nKylie set up her father’s portable gas grill. The smell of barbecue and the warm glow of the fire provided a backdrop of normalcy from the otherwise strange end to the day. Darkness fell and shrouded the lighthouse in shadow. I watched the top waiting for the light to flick on, but it remained dark. \n\nZach pulled a bottle of champagne from the cooler. Kylie handed out glasses.\n\nZach raised his. “To our success.”\n\nKylie broke into a broad smile. “Enjoy the final throes of anonymity. This movie we’re making is going to make us all famous.”\n\nBen accepted a glass. “What’s the plan for tomorrow?”\n\n“Scout around. Get as much footage as we can.”\n\nZach drained his glass in a single gulp. “When we get back we should keep this under wraps. Until we can get the movie out.”\n\nKylie nodded. “No one call home in the meantime. We don’t need a Johnny-come-lately scooping us. ”\n\nZach lifted his phone in the air. “Can’t anyway. No service.”\n\nBen checked his phone and put it swiftly back into his pocket.\n\nI cleared my throat. “Am I the only one with a bad feeling about this?”\n\nZach smirked. “Yes.”\n\nBen let out an exaggerated sigh. “You’re always so negative. Why can’t you for once not assume the worst?”\n\nI shot him a dirty look he may not have seen by the firelight. “What do we know about this place? Anyone?”\n\n“Why don’t you enlighten us.”\n\nI bristled at Ben’s sarcastic tone. \n\n“Of the four people we know that have come to this place, two were never seen again, one shot himself rather than come back and the fourth went insane and decapitated a baby and then was hanged. Maybe we shouldn’t celebrate yet. I have half a mind to jump in the truck and drive back to Razorback Hill.”\n\nEveryone fell silent. Zach toed a small hole in the dirt. He put down his plate of food. In the firelight his face grew gaunt and pale. \n\n“Kylie, can you help me with something?” Zach stood and using his phone as a torch made his way to the building.\n\nKylie followed and they disappeared into the darkness of the lighthouse. \n\nBen cleared his throat. “You’ve still got a problem with me?”\n\n“Some things don’t have a statute of limitations.”\n\n“You’re the most stubborn person I’ve ever met. You’ve turned an anthill into damn Mount Everest and no one can convince you otherwise.”\n\nI scoffed. “You and I are going to get through this trip and then go back to our separate lives. I can’t believe Kylie brought us both out here.”\n\n“Maybe she was trying to get back something we all lost.”\n\nMuffled shouting came from the lighthouse. It was Kylie’s raised voice first and then Zach’s. I couldn’t make out what they were saying. The door flung open and Kylie emerged. It was a full ten seconds before Zach followed, his face stony, like he had been dealt some bad news but was determined to not let it show.\n\nThe mood around camp was as cold as the night desert air. There was little further conversation before Kylie announced she was turning in. We all followed. We rolled sleeping mats out on the floor. Zach flicked off his shoes and slid into his sleeping bag, not bothering to undress.\n\nI watched the inside wall of the lighthouse, the remnants of the fire casting a flickering soft light through the window. My shirt smelled of the smoke from the fire. I zipped up my sleeping bag to trap the smell and turned up my nose. A new smell replaced the smell of the smoke, the same scent I had first smelled in the car before we saw the ghost gum. What was it? \n\nMy head swimming a little from the champagne, I soon fell asleep.\n\nThe whistling of the wind woke me. I turned in my sleeping bag and groaned to let everyone know I was awake. When I opened my eyes, I discovered an empty room. I blinked at the orange light filtering through the window. I had to piss.\n\nI walked around the back of the lighthouse. The sun was fully above the horizon to the east. I turned back to the ground and then my head flicked back up. The ghost gum should be out there, towering over the rest of the trees. And there it was. But it hadn’t been there when I first looked. I was sure of it. \n\nKylie and Ben were sat at the deckchairs circling the remnants of the fire.\n\n“Where is Zach?” I asked.\n\nKylie shrugged. “I haven’t seen him yet.”\n\n“Did he go for a walk or something? Would he wander off like that without telling anyone?”\n\nKylie said, “I’m sure he’s fine.”\n\nBen shivered. “I heard stuff last night. The wind. Voices. Someone crying.”\n\nHe had my attention. “Someone crying?”\n\n“I don’t know. That’s what it sounded like. A baby crying.”\n\nI had heard sounds too, in that mystical, fuzzy place between sleep and consciousness. I told myself it was the wind, but could it have been?\n\n“A baby? Out here?”\n\nBen lowered his voice as if to reduce the ridiculousness of the notion. “That’s what it sounded like.”\n\nKylie threw the dregs of her mug on the coals. They hissed. “You were dreaming.”\n\n“I wasn’t dreaming. And I got up in the night to have a look, and I’m pretty sure Zach was gone.”\n\nA ripple of uneasiness turned into a tidal wave. “He was gone?”\n\n“I can’t be sure, but I think so.”\n\n“What time was it?”\n\n“I didn’t check. It was dark still. I figured he’d gone for a piss or something.”\n\n“So he could have been gone for hours?”\n\nKylie sat passively, her hands folded between her knees. “I’m sure it’s nothing. He got up early and went for a walk.”\n\nBen shook his head at the explanation. “Without telling anyone? That doesn’t make sense. I want to drive back to Razorback Hill and call the police or something. Give me the keys.”\n\nThis was the wrong move and I knew it. As much as I had wanted to be gone from this place, we couldn’t leave Zach out here. “That’s a bad idea.”\n\n“You’re the one who said we should be worried out here. Everyone who has come here has ended up dead or missing one way or another. Give me the keys.”\n\nKylie stood and wiped her hands on her knees. “We’ll go and look for him. We can’t drive back to Razorback Hill. What if he comes back here, which he will.”\n\nBen threw up his hands and stormed back into the lighthouse. It was strange how upset he was, and Kylie’s calm in comparison.\n\nShe said, “Did you hear anything last night?”\n\nFor some reason I didn’t want to admit that I had heard something like crying. I had woken from what I thought was a dream. But even with my eyes open I had heard it. Something was out there. Something that shouldn’t be out there. \n\nI shook my head.\n\nThe door to the lighthouse flew back open and Ben stomped back to the fire. His eyes were wide and streaked with red from lack of sleep. He looked like he might break down and cry. \n\n“Give me the car keys please.”\n\nKylie turned up her palms, “I can’t.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Zach had them.”\n\nWe followed Ben back inside. He dropped to the ground and rummaged through Zach’s sleeping bag. He unzipped Zach’s backpack and threw clothes on the floor.\n\nPart of me wanted to join Ben. I wanted out of this situation. A lot wasn’t adding up and I didn’t want to mess with it. But we couldn’t leave without Zach. Today would be hot and dry and it was no place to be abandoned.\n\nKylie leaned down and touched Ben on the shoulder. “Ben, stop.”\n\nBen paused rifling through Zach’s things and looked up at us, eyes pleading. “I don’t want to be here anymore.”\n\nKylie pointed her finger to the door. “Then we have to find Zach.”\n\nFrom somewhere out in the trees came the faint sound of a baby crying.\n\n [Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/comments/y3ngzo/welcome_message/)",
