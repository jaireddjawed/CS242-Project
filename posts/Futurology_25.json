Even if it has a small population it would be great to find my people again.\n\nAlso, what's your thoughts about it? Is there still old members here or have we all set sail?",

Would we expect the quality of their essays to be equal? \n\nNo.\n\nThose with the best essays are those who are best able to use AI. These people treat the initial output of the AI as merely a draft. They judge and critique the draft. They go through revision after revision. They do not cease until the essay is to a standard that they deem fit. \n\nIn the end, the line between student or AI authorship is blurred. One can only be sure that it is a collaboration between the two. \n\nThus, the most important skill here is judgment. The ability to evaluate work critically, pinpoint shortcomings, and articulate improvements for an AI to execute. \n\nThe example I've given here is for essays. But it could be for interior design, video animation, financial projections, etc.\n\nWhat do y'all think?",

Now I am a young girl in tech, angel investor who made a lot of money and founded a successful AI company with some \"techbros.\" Wasn't supposed to be where I am now, in the middle of a happening tech microcosm where everyone around me is frivolous and whacky and have colorfully fucked-up lives. Here, scientists and founders building your apps and AIs are celebs and gods. So much power and access. Drugs, plant medicine, aestheticizing the race towards novelty and power, sex, OF models, burning money to the ground. That's all I see and hear.\n\nAm I being disrespectful to people who have this lifestyle? I don't think so, I am now one of them. I grew up wishing for a happy, content life with a partner to grow old with but honestly, traveling the world in the next year seems like a much easier undertaking than finding someone here who will want the same. Hell, even I have stopped wanting the same. I mourn the loss of the simple girl I used to be who believed in love and monogamy. I'm fucked up doing research on recommendation systems for dating apps. I'm disillusioned - I know every statistical pattern of every kind of romantic interaction that is doomed to fail. On top of that, everyone around me is constantly jumping from one thing to another, be it professionally or romantically or even just in terms of day-to-day activities. I'm a thrill seeker to the core now, and peace bores me. Inaction bores me. Will I be capable of having long-term romantic relationships if I feel like this already? I hate it but I have become it. Maybe everyone these days has lowered attention and emotional span, but I feel like for us in this high-stress casino-esque environment where we only think about exciting futures and never want to miss out on any, it's so much worse.",

        "text": "There are competing plans to launch the first floating city, with Pusan, Korea, and Maldives being announced as locations for 2025 and 2027 respectively. The Pusan plan is UN-backed and led by a company called Oceanix. As one would imagine, much thought has gone into making the environment highly sustainable, leveraging water conservation technology, solar power, aqua- and hydroponics, etc.\n\nI’m curious to know at a high level what people think of the prospect of living in a floating city. What would you need to have to make it feasible for you? What would be your biggest fears? I could ask countless sub-questions, but I’ll leave it at that. Please share your thoughts and questions openly.",

I want to know why OpenAI would program a machine to lie?",

You can't go on social media these days without seeing posts and posts of art created by AI like MidJourney and DALL-E. While ChatGPT in particular seems popular amongst those who work with text, whether it is for something as simple as writing an email or editing an article or story. \n\nAs a writer, and a writer of science fiction at that, this is obviously a topic I am particularly interested in and so  I thought I would try and write a story about an AI with ChatGPT. This is a record of our \"conversation\" and the story (or stories) we produced. If I learned one thing, it's that chatbot's like ChatGPT are still a ways off from being able to replicate human creativity. Will it ever get there?",
