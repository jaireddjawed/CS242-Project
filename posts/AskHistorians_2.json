        "text": "The infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 was undeniably a failed piece of legislature for multiple reasons. Here i am focusing on its failure to provide relief to the struggling farmer \n\n**An Oversimplified Summary:** In 1929 when work on Smoot-Hawley began, the economy as a whole was performing quite well but the agricultural sector had been struggling for about a decade since the wartime demand for US agricultural exports had petered off. The industrial sector had long been prospering under a blanket of protection in the form of tariffs.\n\nRelief for the farmer was indeed recognized at both ends of the political spectrum as a priority though without a consensus on what type of relief should be prescribed. Leading up to 1929 democrats, primarily representing agricultural interests, had advocated for subsidization as a means of relief. Republicans, primarily representing industrial interests and with a tight grip on political power, favored tariffs. This stems from the fact that the agricultural sector overwhelmingly sold its goods for export and for the most part did not face the competition from foreign imports which the industrial sector did or would without tariffs. \n\n**The Confusion:** The agricultural sector broadly could not profit from tariffs because it wasn’t selling on the domestic market where tariffs have an effect. **Its’ simply the wrong answer yet some agriculturalists/exporters/interests groups advocated in favor of the tariffs.** The inappropriate nature of this tariff reform wasn’t a secret as many contemporary economists voiced their concern. \n\n**The Question(s):** I understand the bill would be passed as a result of log-rolling and so my question focuses more narrowly on asking **why tariffs were advocated for by (people, firms, interest groups) who were not positioned to profit from it? Who were these proponents and what were their motivations?** In asking these questions I am particularly interested in the lesser obvious proponents, i.e., exporters or agriculturalists who advocated for tariffs not manufacturers with more obviously something to gain. \n\nOn the flip side, **are there anomalies among the adversaries?** Here I mean for example industrialists who had reason to believe they were poised to profit from new/ increasing tariffs, but had the far-sightedness to look beyond their own focused interests, recognize the needs of the broader economy, and consequently advocated against increased tariff protection.",

        "text": "Last December I read Richard White's *The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650–1815* and found it extremely informative as someone who grew up in the Midwest—it filled a lot of gaps in knowledge I had about colonial history. However, if I had any complaints, it would probably be that once White gets past the years leading up to 1776 it sort of reads like he's sprinting towards the finish? IIRC he presents glimpses of the western theater of the Revolutionary War, US military blunders during the Northwest Indian War, then concludes with remarks on Tecumsah's confederacy as it lead into the War of 1812. All the while providing details on the shifting roles of settlers and fur trade companies in the region (which I certainly appreciated). I might've missed it, but I don't remember him talking much about how US Indian policy differed from the British in the early days of the republic. Like a fascinating piece of trivia that still lingers with me is how the Stamp Act was enacted in part to fund a British Indian Policy that wasn't outright genocidal as it had been before 1763, and that they were ostensibly looking to limit settler expansion into the Old Northwest. Clearly, the nascent US didn't care much for maintaining relations on the so-called middle ground; but I'd like to know to what extent its policy towards indigenous tribes was informed by it, especially before the Jacksonian era.",

This isn't the reason the churches were burned but please ignore that for now.

The ballet is marvelous, but how much can a person take?\"\n\nThe full interrupted piece was suddenly broadcast in 1982 before announcing the deaths of Leonid Brezhnev, and then again before announcing the death of his successor, Yuri Andropov, and the death of Andropov's successor, Konstantin Chernenko. Then, in 1991, the ballet was once again broadcast (I have head for three days straight) during the attempted coup.\n\nI have 2 questions:\n1) Why did Soviet leadership select to broadcast Swan Lake before these events? Was it coincidence, or did it have some deeper meaning among the Soviet people?\n\n2) Were/are there any jokes in Soviet Russia (and to an extent, the Russian Federation) regarding Swan Lake as being bad news (i.e. someone saying \"my day has been do bad, Swan Lake is about to start playing\")?",

This proved\nto be an historic schism in the then Rising Tide of the Youth Movement\nof the Sixties. It was the first open break between the Greasers and the\nLonghairs, and the importance of that break can be read in the history\nof SDS, which eventually destroyed in the doomed effort to reconcile the\ninterests of the 'working class biker/dropout types and the upper/mid\nBerkeley/student activists.\n\nNobody involved in that scene, at the time, could possibly have foreseen\nthe Implications of the Ginsberg/Kesey failure to pursuade the Hell's\nAngels to join forces with the radical Left from Berkeley. The final\nsplit came at Altamont, four years later, but by that time it had long\nbeen clear to everybody except a handful of rock industry dopers and the\nnational press. The orgy of violence at Altamont merey dramatized the\nproblem. The realities were already fixed; the illness was understood to\nbe terminal, and the energies of The Movement were long since aggressively\ndissipated by the rush to self-preservation.”\n\nSo what exactly is Thompson talking about?",

        "text": "Hi, I've often seen the claim that the Black Death led to a labor shortage, which resulted in increased power for labor and drove up wages. In the stronger versions, this is even said to have led to the transition from feudalism to capitalism. But I've had trouble tracing out the precise origins and detailed mechanisms for this claim; as a wide reader but non-historian, it's something I just seem to find \"around\" over and over. And it's a bit perplexing, because, obviously, just having a smaller population in itself doesn't lead to a labor \"shortage,\" since there is also less demand for things-- fewer people to work the fields, but also fewer people to feed. On a first pass, one might imagine the economic effect of a mass dying would be instead to make for fewer workers but also less production and employment, with no particular expected result on relative class power or things like wages. Thus, I'd imagine if the claim has been argued in serious detail, it would involve some much more specific claims as the the mechanism of how this particular drop in population would lead to labor and wage changes of certain kinds, possibly specific to the particular structures of 14th century Europe which were very different than modern capitalism. What's the sophisticated version of this claim, and who would argue from historical records that it's correct or incorrect?  \n\n\n(Also, if I may be allowed to include a secondary question for those who may wish, I said \"Europe\" above because I've only ever seen this claim about labor and economic change for Europe, but has anything like this claim been applied outside Europe, as the plague caused mass dying in many other places as well?)",
