        "text": "I am working on the topic of retrofitting of reinforced concrete beam column joints, but I have a small problem if you may help me with it. I need to create a model on abaqus under 2 steps of loading; the first one is loading the column with concentrated force, and the second is loading the beam tip with monotonic load (displacement control). So, the problem I face is starting the second step through using the end product of the first one, and I was wondering if you can give me some assistance in this regard. The major challenge I face is that whenever I try to measure the displacement of the beam after adding the additional load on the beam, the beam usually resets its starting point to zero instead of continuing from the point where the initial load on the column left it in the beam column joint.",

Inside the box, I have electronic circuits and optics (e.g. an acousto optic modulator), of which many are temperature and sound-sensitive.

Would an additional layer of convoluted foam inside for additional absorption of especially higher frequencies make sense? What would be the ideal order of the layers (from outside to inside, styrofoam first or foam)?  \nI was also wondering if there is an advantage of adding \"air layers\" in between.\n\nShould I consider making separate chambers inside the box e.g. for the electronics and the optics?\n\nFurthermore, how I can estimate the effect of taking X cm thick layers of these materials, both on acoustic and thermal isolation? \n\nThank you for sharing you experience and knowledge!",

The land is flat other than the height of the stream bank. There is minimal elevation change.\n\nAlso, what would be the best type of piping to use? Which would offer the least resistance?\n\nIs there a formula to help calculate this? Do I only look for cc size and GPM? I don't care much about the GPM output as I plan to pump water to my cattle almost every day and I can run the pump as long as necessary to fill up the trough.\n\nThank you!",

I think it would be pretty similar to a delta 3D printer. However, I have no idea what this sort of mechanism is called (so that I can look at references) or if there is a simpler equivalent.

I wonder if this is true.\n\nTherefore,  i'm requesting for your advice to help me take my decisions, or tell  about how your course is for those who is taking/taken SE/CS which could  help me alot, thank you so much!!",

Does the crankcase need this access to the outside world? I imagine there are pressure differentials that need management, but there must be a simple-ish way around that, no?  It's like they're asking for trouble! \n\n...or is this a case of \"of course they can keep it sealed -- but that would add to the weight and price\"? \n\nAnd is this an issue for small engines only, or would your car leak oil too if tipped the wrong way?",
