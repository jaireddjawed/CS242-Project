I decided to give back by writing this post about my own experience with this program.\n\nAge: 22\n\nHeight: 6'3\"\n\nWeight: \\~190 lbs -> \\~200lbs (I normally weigh myself every day but the two days I forgot to check the weight before eating just happened to be the first and last day lol)\n\nStarting DL max (estimated): 365 lbs.\n\nI started powerlifting at some point in 2020, but I really don't count any of that training because of how many times gyms closed and reopened during that year because of Covid. In 2021 I started running Nsuns 531 and reaped the LP rewards of being a novice lifter. I trained conventional as my primary stance, but I didn't realize how detrimental my form was until I started pulling in the 300s. Because of the discomfort, I would get on deadlift days I simply started skipping them and my progress completely stopped on that lift. Funny enough, I hurt my lower back while squatting in early 2022 and after a break from training (and reading Stu McGill's Back Mechanic) I came back to the gym and ran Jim Wendler's Building The Monolith program - using sumo deadlifts because my conventional form still caused flexion in my lower back which was a no for me (for some reason, I chalked that up to my anthropometry and not a form issue). After completing that program, I had some elbow tendonitis but I was bigger and stronger than ever IMO. A month or so after completing that program I broke my right humerus while arm wrestling and had to take another break from the gym for a whole 3 months. When I got back I started a hypertrophy-focused program aimed at evening out my withered right side before getting back into PL.\n\nOver this time, I started watching more powerlifting content on youtube as opposed to general fitness content and I learned that my form on the conventional deadlift was to blame and not necessarily my body type. So I looked around Reddit for a deadlifting program and found the Coan-Phillipi deadlift program.\n\nI used [http:\/\/tsampa.org\/training\/scripts\/coan\\_phillipi\\_deadlift\/](http:\/\/tsampa.org\/training\/scripts\/coan_phillipi_deadlift\/) for my calculator\/training log. I did this workout on Fridays and did squats on Monday, bench on Tuesday, and Squat variation on Thursday. The program I used was a 10-week beginner PL program I got from Liftvault. The reason I used a beginner program was so I could quickly get my squat and bench back up to what they were before the injury as quickly as possible (Bi-weekly Linear progression). I used Coan-Phillipi for the deadlift because my deadlift wasn't really that strong, to begin with, compared to the other lifts (I could squat more than I deadlift).\n\nOn a final note, diet. I tried my best to stay in a caloric surplus with 1g\/lb BW protein a day. I didn't track until the last 2 weeks so I know I fell short of this several times early on. I go to school full-time right now so money for food is kinda tight, especially in the economic climate of my country. Oats, eggs, ground beef, and peanut butter have been my loyal companions throughout.\n\nWeek 1\n\n**Deadlift (75%):** 1x2 @ 305 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlifts (60%):** 8x3 @ 245 lbs (90-sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps - 225 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 8 reps - 135 lbs\n\n**Weighted Chin-up**: 8 reps - BW\n\nG**ood morning**: 8 reps - 95 lbs\n\nThis was a nice easy start to the program although the lower back pump was crazy (not painful though). I was tempted to up the weight actually because of how easy the top set this week was.\n\nThe speed deadlifts were pretty brutal because of the short rest times but it really helped me nail the form quickly. I started off with an ambitious SLDL weight and a very conservative bent-over row. The good mornings were sort of new and because I did everything with one barbell I had to clean and press the weight to get it on my back.\n\nWeek 2\n\n**Deadlift (80%):** 1x2 @ 325 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (65%):** 8x3 @ 265 lbs (90 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps - 185 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 8 reps - 185 lbs\n\n**Weighted Chin-up**: 8 reps - BW+20 Lbs\n\n**Good morning**: 8 reps - 115 lbs\n\nThe lower back pump this week was even crazier and the increase in weight of the deadlifts and speed deadlifts left me too fatigued to do the same weight as last week on the stiff leg so I dropped it on the second circuit to match the bent-over rows (saving me the trouble of changing the weights too). I did feel like my grip was a limiting factor on the circuits this week because my forearms were so fried from the volume on deadlifts.\n\nWeek 3\n\n**Deadlift (85%):** 1x2 @ 345 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (70%):** 6x3 @ 285 lbs (90-120 sec rest b\/w sets)3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps - 195 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 8 reps - 195 lbs\n\nW**eighted chin-up**: 8 reps - BW+ 25 lbs\n\n**Good morning**: 8 reps - 120 lbs\n\nMy lower back finally felt decent after this one probably due to the lower number of speed deadlifts. Forearms were less of a problem this week as well though I did have to break up my last set of weighted chins into 6 and 2 because I slipped off the bar (probably just sweaty palms though).\n\nWeek 4\n\n**Deadlift (90%):** 1x2 @ 365 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (75%):** 5x3 @ ~~305 lbs~~ 315 lbs (90-120 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps @ 190 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 8 reps @ 190 lbs\n\n**Weighted chin-up**: 8 reps @ BW +35 lbs\n\n**~~Good morning~~**~~: 8 reps~~\n\n365 absolutely flew this week and I felt so good that I did 315 for the speed deadlifts instead of 305. I had a time constraint this week so I cut the good mornings out of the circuit to save on time.\n\nWeek 5\n\n**Deadlift (80%):** 3x3 @ 325 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (65%):** 3x3 @ 265 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n**Power shrugs (60% of current):** 3x5 @ 225 lbs\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 3x5 @ 205 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 3x5 @ 195 lbs\n\n**Weighted chinup**:3x5 @ BW + 45 lbs\n\n**~~Good morning~~**~~: 3x5 @ 135 lbs~~\n\nHad to cut good mornings again this week bc of time but felt great otherwise. It was nice to actually see my progress on this same weight over just 3 weeks. In week 2, I had to pull this mixed grip for a double with a belt. On this day I pulled double overhand and beltless for 3 triples.\n\nI did the shrugs strictly even though it said to do power shrugs. At this weight, it didn't make sense to purposely deteriorate the form when I can shrug it just fine normally.\n\nWeek 6\n\n**Deadlift (85%):** 1x2 @ 345 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (70%):** 3x3 @ 285 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n**Power shrugs (65% of current):** 3x5 @ 240 lbs\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 3x5 @ 225 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 3x5 @ 205 lbs\n\n**Weighted Chin-up**:3x5 @ BW +55 lbs\n\n**Good morning**: 3x5 135 lbs\n\nThe deadlifts were pretty easy but at the same time, not as easy as they should have been. I think this is due to recovery on this day more than anything - I had a disturbed sleep the night before and tried to compensate with lots of food before the workout. The power shrugs were still easy but my grip became the limiting factor today (possibly cuz I held the last rep of each set of speed deadlifts for 5 seconds to improve grip strength).\n\nWeek 7\n\n**Deadlift (90%):** 1x2 @ 365 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (75%):** 3x3 @ ~~305 lbs~~ 315 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n**Power shrugs (70% of current):** 2x5 @ ~~260 lbs~~ 275 lbs\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 2x5 @ 245 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 2x5 @ 205 lbs\n\n**Weighted Chin-up:** 2x5 @ BW + 65 lbs\n\n**Good morning**: 2x5 @ 135 lbs\n\nThe first rep of the 365 was a little slow off the ground but the second one flew. After this program, I'll probably do something to help with my speed off the ground (any recommendations would be appreciated). I upped the weight on power shrugs because it didn't seem intense enough. And even with the increased weight, my traps felt fine and my grip was still the limiting factor (even with straps) - just all that weight being jostled in my palms was hard to hold on to. I bought chalk after the workout so we'll see how I fair next week.\n\nWeek 8\n\n**Deadlift (95%):** 1x2 @ 385 lbs\n\n**Speed deadlift (70%):** 3x3 @ 285 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)\n\n**Power shrugs (75% of current):** 2x5 @ ~~280lbs~~ 285lbs (it was simpler to just bump the weight 5 lbs and not have to take anything off the bar)\n\n**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 2x5 @ 265 lbs\n\n**Bent over row**: 2x5 @ 225 lbs\n\n**Weighted Chinups**: 2x5 @ BW +75 lbs\n\n**Good morning**: 2x5 @ 155 lbs\n\nI was actually really sick this whole week and only went on Friday to do CP deadlifts. Wasnt 100% but still got 385 pretty easily. Definitely could've pulled 405 this day even though I was still sick. That's how strong I felt.\n\nWeek 9\n\n**Deadlift (97.5%):** 1x1 @ 395 lbs\n\n**~~Speed deadlift (70%):~~** ~~2x3 @ 285 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)~~\n\n**~~Power shrugs (75% of current):~~** ~~2x5 @ 300 lbs~~\n\n**~~Stiff-leg deadlift~~**~~: 2x5 @ 225 lbs~~\n\nMy friend happened to deadlift 405 earlier this week and I felt the need to do the same so I skipped 395 and just pulled 405. Then 425. Then 455. Tried 475 but I was gassed at this point so it didn't move. Even though I felt awful while warming up I managed to pull a 90 lbs PR.\n\n~~Week 10~~\n\n**~~Deadlift (100%):~~** ~~1x1 @ 405 lbs~~\n\n**~~Speed deadlift (60%):~~** ~~2x3 @ 245 lbs (120 sec rest b\/w sets)~~\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n90 lbs in 9 Weeks I definitely won't complain. This program was a lot of fun for me which is either indicative of how much I enjoy the feeling of exhaustion after a workout or maybe that my goal max wasn't ambitious enough.\n\nI definitely had some novel stimulus and neurological adaptation gains here but I definitely think the program is very solid. 4 weeks of building a wide base and then 5 weeks (4 in my case) of peaking to get a new max.\n\nI'll be testing my squat and bench maxes in about 2 weeks. The program I was running for those was also a ten week but got delayed because of the week I was sick.\n\n**Will I run this program again?** Definitely. In fact, I want to start it over from next week but I think I'll need to deload a bit first before jumping back in. Even if I don't get another 90 lbs. I'll be happy to just chip away until I can pull 500 lbs.\n\n**Gains:**\n\n* 90-pound **PR deadlift**\n* Spinal Erectors of steel\n* Improved deadlift form and efficiency (from the speed deadlifts)\n\nFeel free to AMA or give me advice based on what I've shared here.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677883258.0},{"title":"Saturday Flea Market","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/11hq37w\/saturday_flea_market\/","text":"\\*\\*A thread for selling or buying any powerlifting related goods.

This is my second meet ever. Really enjoy competing so I will continue though I am going to keep training like a bodybuilder mostly. first meet last year I totaled 1820 at 225.\n\nPrep \n\nI stuck with a bro split for almost the entire time leading up to the meet. I was training like a fool, I maxed out almost every week. I hoped on a program I found around 6 weeks out(way to late). Also, I made a MAJOR mistake with deadlift training. I used straps for all my deadlifting, I figured my grip strength is well enough I\u2019ll be fine. I did not think about how when I switch to mixed grip my back is worked a little different. At 15 weeks out I hit a PR of 770 on deadlift (with straps, my first meet PR was 760). Squat training was going well until I got super fatigued from maxing so often. I ended up hurting my knee on a 650 squat. I wasn\u2019t letting the weight settle on my back long enough and on the way up I was unsteady, I completed the squat but my knee had a sharp pain that has yet to fully heal. Bench training went the best but the maxing was killing the tendons in my arms. leading up to the meet I did hit a gym pr. I did not diet down or anything I just kept my diet in a small surplus. No cutting for meet day either. \n\nMeet day \n\nI just recovered from having RSV two days before, and had an injured knee so I was planning on a bench pr and a big deadlift pr. The meet was maxed out with 40 lifters. I was in the 3rd flight so timing my warm ups was absolutely horrible. I timed well for squat but bench I ended up waiting 3 times as long for them to get to me. This threw off my warm up and for deadlift it was rapid I was almost up before I knew it. \n\nSquat 1 [good lift @ 600lbs\/272kgs]\nWeight felt good but my knee flared up bad.\n\nSquat 2 [Good lift @ 630lbs\/286kgs] \nThis was a meet PR but my knee was totally done after this. I had to ice it in the back I was limping from the pain. \n\nSquat 3 [skipped lift] \nMy knee was feeling a little better but I did not want to risk a serious injury. \n\nBench 1 [Good lift @ 425lbs\/193kgs]\nFelt easy. Good first attempt weight for me.\n\nBench 2 [Good lift @ 450lbs\/203kgs]\nThe press was smooth but I hit the rack just slightly. I don\u2019t think they noticed. I did a self lift off bc I am used to it in training. My lower backed cramped up bad. It about knocked the air out of me. \n\nBench 3 [No lift @ 460lbs\/206kgs]\nI took a lift off for this one. The lift off was perfect but I was not used to the longer holding time before the down command. Gave it a good push but not strong enough.\n\nDeadlift [INJURY]\nDeadlift warm ups were fast. I did mixed grip for the first time in 5 months. My last warm up set 700lbs in the back as soon as I broke the floor I felt a pop in my right Lat. Bruising came fast. I had to drop out of the comp. The injury was a tear in the teres major. My planned opener was 735 with a 800lbs\/363kgs second attempt which is over the state record. \n\n\nFuture \nI learned a lot.

The TLDR is I had comp PR's on every lift, although I didn't perform quite as well as I had hoped. 6\/9. 65 lb total PR. I had a ton of fun and look forward to competing again. \n\n**Prep:**\n\nI was having the most enjoyable and fruitful training cycle I had had in a looooong time training conjugate for the last 15 weeks or so. It almost felt like a shame to break it up with peaking for a meet.  I had seen big PRs in all lifts in the gym after a pretty long time of being stalled on squat and deadlift.\n\nThe big wild-card factor was that my peak felt wonky. I had a business trip 3 weeks out from the meet where I only got 1 \"hotel fitness center\" workout in. No barbell, dumbbells maxed at 35. You know the drill. I honestly felt like I hit the \"peak\" the week after that trip rather than actually on meet day. \n\n**Squat:**  Squats went great, but I should have been a little more aggressive on my 3rd attempt. \n\nAttempt 1- 170, Buried it and it felt great! This was a 5 lb meet PR already. Three whites\n\n Attempt 2- 180, Buried it and it was a bit of a grind but I never felt like I wasn't going to get it. In retrospect, I don't know what was going through my mind for calling such a small jump for my 3rd. I know I wanted over 400 lbs and I think this felt like the way to guarantee it. Three whites.\n\nAttempt 3- 182.5, This was a bit of a grinder but I'm really proud of it. Depth was no question. Three whites. 30 lb meet PR. \n\n**Bench:** According to both meets I have done, my M.O. is underperforming on the bench.\n\nAttempt 1- 120, Smoked it, but I was a little intimidated by how long the wait was for the press command going into attempt 2. Nonetheless, 20 lb meet PR. Three whites.\n\nAttempts 2 & 3- 127.5- Got it off the chest but stalled about 6 inches up. Missed both attempts. I hit both 130 and 132.5 in training with a pause so this was disappointing, but still moved the total up, so I'm happy.\n\n**Deadlift:** I felt like my deadlift technique finally clicked for me in the warmup room like it never has before. Finally felt like I was setting my back and not shooting my hips up off the floor.\n\nAttempt 1- 210, This looked almost like speed work. It actually moved so (surprisingly) fast that I lost my balance after I locked out. Three reds. \n\nAttempt 2- 210, Took it again, no problem. 10 pounds below meet PR. Three whites. \n\nAttempt 3- 227.5, I really wanted 500+ today. This was the best feeling heavy deadlift I can remember lifting. Felt like I had 30 pounds in the tank. A good feeling, even if I felt like I left a bit on the table. Three whites. 15 lb meet PR. \n\n**Moving Forward:**\n\nLooking forward to competing again in 9 months-year. This was a blast and I can't wait to get back to training, especially after feeling how well my deadlift clicked.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677382593.0},{"title":"Powerlifting Victory Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/11cfbsm\/powerlifting_victory_thread\/","text":" \n\nThis is the thread to post your:\n\n* Powerlifting accomplishments\n* Training PRs\n* Gym or diet related victories\n* Best flexing photos\n* Sweet new equipment purchases\n* Gym dog or gym family photos\n\nOr really anything you felt good or happy about from the last week (or even further back in time, no one's gonna stop you).\n\nText, images, videos, any format goes.\n\nLet's get those good vibes flowing.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1677412821.0},{"title":"Daily Thread - February 26, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/11cd4hq\/daily_thread_february_26_2023\/","text":"A sorta kinda daily open thread to use as an alternative to posting on the main board.

Went 8\/9. I'm now addicted and want more. Prep was solid overall but there is room for improvement on my end. USPA Nats and state records are next on the menu. Cocoa Crispies are your friend.  \n\n\n**Background**\n\n  \nI've been training for going on five years now, with a focus on powerlifting for only about one year. The other four years I was more focused on improving my body composition and not necessarily my strength although I did inevitably do so. I just utilized commercial gyms until I began focusing on powerlifting, at which time I joined a very powerlifting focused gym and got set up with a solid programmer, coaches and culture.\u00a0\n\n  \nThere was some confusion\/miscommunication with my training (weekly reporting issues\/goals\/etc) for the first 6ish months so it wasn't until November of last year that I began prepping for my first meet. This meet.\n\n  \n**Prep**\n\n  \nI did four days a week of powerlifting focused training and one day where I did what I enjoyed while still being productive. For powerlifting days I always had two days of Bench Press and one day each of Deadlift and Squat. I was given free reign of my training schedule itself so I organized everything into a Push, Legs, Pull rotation so my off days would vary but I always had plenty of rest time for my upper back and shoulders.\n\n  \nI stayed at Hypertrophy focused rep ranges for my accessories (my coach gives me a total rep expectation rather than rep ranges and I do pick the resistance) with consistent progressive overload and a deload programmed every 5ish weeks.\n\n  \nSome training tools included Camber\/Duffalo\/Bamboo Bar work, Bands, Blocks, and Boxes.  \nNutrition wise I ate whatever with an emphesis on carbs and protein. The exception being a few weeks at the beginning of January where I got the motivation to drop into a defecit and cut some fat before coming back out of said deficit four weeks out.\n\n  \nThere was some confusion on my end and I did not know I would have to walk out my Squats until like four weeks out so that's when I began practicing that. #MonoGangCuh\n\n  \nI stayed out of my comp knee sleeves as much as I could (used some cheap and thin crummy ones but may as well of not used any at all) while also staying out of my belt during Bench until peak week. I stayed away from Salts as well until Peak Week.\u00a0\n\n  \nAlso, ended up getting sick as fuck going into Peak Week but got my main lifts done each day then ran home to crawl into bed like a baby. I tested negative for COVID twice but damn did it feel like I had it.\n\n  \nThe week of my meet I began feeling much better, did not touch anything with weight but instead focused on mobility work, stretching, massage, and getting to the meet itself. I say that because my meet was in my hometown over 1400 miles away from where I currently live and train.\u00a0\n\n  \nMy girlfriend and mom (momma's boys for the win) accompanied me and we drove the 1400+ miles because my girlfriend won't fly. We made a somewhat fun vacation out of the trip and my mom got to spend her birthday at home with family. I currently type this in a hotel in Casper, WY where we are stuck on our way back to the Midwest due to a blizzard. My girlfriend will now definitely be working on conquering her fear of flying.\n\n  \nThat's kinda that for everything leading up to the day prior to the meet.  \n\n\n**The Day Prior**\n\n  \nWeigh-ins were on Saturday and I weighed in slightly dehydrated at 236.3 Freedom Units with the weekly average being around 240. I immediately went out to the car and stuffed my face with a tupperware container of Cocoa Crispies that I had packed that morning. The focus was high carb food all day with a majority of my fluids being Gatorade. I engorged myself with conveyor belt sushi, took an afternoon nap, and just relaxed. An attempt was made to get a decent night's sleep but I woke up at 3am with an intense craving for more Cocoa Crispies that of course had to be addressed before falling back asleep for a few hours.  \n\n\n**Meet Day**\n\n  \nBreakfast consisted of three breakfast sandwiches to provide ample protein and fat until after the meet was over. I packed two fruit smoothies and yes, you guessed it, more Cocoa Crispies.\n  \nI arrived at the venue pretty early, checked the flights and found myself amongst four other guys in my class who all had competed before. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't looked them up on Open Powerlifting. For every flight I warmed up exactly how I warm up in the gym. Some light mobility work with no major stretching. One plate, two plate, three plate, four. Time to go the fuck to war.\u00a0\n\n  \n***Squat 1: \\[No Lift @ 222.5kg\/490.5lbs\\]***\n\nIt felt great with no major issues and I've hit this in training consistently, but I jumped the gun on the rack command. The only issue I had was the walk out. Took the max jump given by my coach for my next attempt anyways.\n\n  \n***Squat 2: \\[Good Lift @ 237.5kg\/523.5lbs\\]***\n\nSolid lift that I've also hit once or twice in training successfully. The difficulty wasn't really there like it had been before and I think this was due to adrenaline. I feel like if I had to I could have repped this out. More walk out issues so I opted for the higher end of average jump to play it safe but still PR.\n\n  \n***Squat 3: \\[Good Lift @ 247.5kg\/545.6lbs\\]***\n\nBig Ol' Fatty 20lb PR. I'd like to thank my digestive system for holding out during my time of need. The idea of crapping myself was the only scary part of this lift. The fruit smoothie with caffeinated Pre that I drank during my squat warmup may not have been the best decision but I immediately left the platform to go take everything off empty my bowels and refill them with Cocoa Crispies.\n\n  \n***Bench 1: \\[Good Lift @ 140kg\/308lbs\\]***\n\nNothing to note as I have hit this in training for multiples.  \n\n\n***Bench 2: \\[Good Lift @ 150kg\/330lbs\\]***\n\nAlmost a PR but not quite as I have also hit this in training once. Flew with zero issues.  \n\n\n***Bench 3: \\[Good Lift @ 160kg\/352lbs\\]***\n\nPR City baby. Hit this with the slingshot a few weeks leading up to the meet so it felt good to hit this raw. I walked off the platform and one of the side judges said he expects me to open at 385 next time I compete. Lol  \n\n\n***Deadlift 1: \\[Good Lift @ 222.5kg\/490.5lbs\\]***\n\nBasically the plan here was to hit something I knew I could hit in my sleep, then party on the last two lifts of the day. This one flew with zero issues.  \n\n\n***Deadlift 2: \\[Good Lift @ 242.5kg\/534.5lbs\\]***\n\nA PR that flew. I wasn't very nervous for this one as I really was nervous for the next attempt. I had hit 525 in training but it was pretty difficult. I figured I could pull off adding 10lbs and I did.  \n\n\n***Deadlift 3: \\[Good Lift @ 262.5kg\/578.6lbs\\]***\n\nNow is the big boy. This would be a 50+lb PR. and IT WAS. I felt like I was pulling my first attempt. The only major issue which did cost me a light was that my knees dropped during the lockout. I did not even notice until I watched the video afterward. Still was a good lift and I could not have been more thrilled.\n\nSide Note: I would have loved to attach the videos of all these to the post as I have seen others do but when I would upload them to anything but my IG\/Facebook the quality would distort. Check them out there. Links are on my profile. I will put on here and hope it works: [https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Co4oGdPufcI\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Co4oGdPufcI\/)\n\nOverall, I did not place. I did however have an amazing experience. I also ended up putting together a total that qualified me for Nationals. On top of all of that, my family\/friends got to watch, my girlfriend was introduced to the sport, and I got to meet Chael Sonnen (if any of you are into MMA). We had a conversation about powerlifting, current UFC events and training in the gym based on individual goals.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nNats is whats next on the menu. The current state records for my class are old and within my grasp. I would like to head to Nats to set those and hopefully put together a master total that will allow me to attend Worlds, which rumor has it will be held in my hometown. From there I may look at the WRPF and stay active in both Feds. I would like to take this powerlifting thing and run with it as John Haack and Jamal Browner have. Those guys are pretty inspirational in my eyes.\n\nAnother really cool thing is that my girlfriend (who handled for me in this event) is now interested in competing herself. There is a local meet the weekend after Nats so we will be getting her ready for that.\n\nAll in all this has been an experience that has highly motivated me to push forward with my training and take it as far as I possibly can.\n\nI will also be eating Cocoa Crispies at EVERY meet. Non-negotiable.

My last meet was in December of 2021 and, after February 2022, life sort of paused powerlifting for me, and I was focusing on rock climbing instead. At any rate, I\u2019ve been back training since August of 2022 (so a \\~6 month hiatus during which I was very much still active \/ training for other goals). Walking around weight went from \\~205 to as low as \\~187. Overall goal for the meet was to finally crack 1,200. \n\n**Previous Meet PRs:** Bench: 117.5kg\/259.04lbs, Skwat: 192.5kg\/424.39lbs, DL: 230kg\/507.06lbs, Total: 535kg\/1,179.47lbs\n\n**Training:** I\u2019d been doing my own conjugate programming in my garage for my last two meets. However, the garage gym is in storage (I cry) and I\u2019m training once again at a university gym. This being the case, I decided to give JuggernautAI a try, based on Basement Brandon\u2019s glowing recommendation (right before he switched to Evolve, lol) and the absence of specialty bars \/ conjugate accoutrement. I ran the powerlifting program (it chose linear periodization across all three movements) over a four day split (M, W, Th, F). The volume of the deadlift took some getting used to and deadlift for fives still gives me the willies. Top singles in the gym during the peaking phase were 440 on skwat, 270 on bench (failed 275 off the chest one week out), and 475 on DL @ like RPE 7.5. I really just tried to trust the process for the whole cycle and only autoregulated significantly when my lower back or bicep tendons got angry. \n\n**Diet:** This was my first water cut and it was very successful. I usually walk around at 205-ish. Starting on Sunday for Friday weigh-ins, I did 1G, 1.5G, 2G, 2G, 0G and weighed-in at 88.6kg\/195.33lbs. I didn\u2019t track macros or anything, as I am usually pretty good about eating based on how I feel and how my weight is behaving. \n\n**Meet Day** \n\nI felt pretty good after a successful re-feed after weigh-ins. I had a couple Krispy-Kremes and a coffee for breakfast and headed over to the Chaos Lab in Richmond, VA for the meet. Throughout the day I pushed water, ate some salty snacks like peanut butter crackers, and had a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch. I used to be the guy dry-scooping prework for every attempt, but now I just sip on one or two Monsters throughout the whole meet, and that seems to work fine. My warm-up routine is very unscientific and amounts to sets of 5-10 up until \\~50%, then singles until they feel good to usually about 20 pounds under my opener. I\u2019m trying not to do openers in the warm-up room, anymore. \n\n**Skwat**: \n\n\\-185kg\/407.85lbs: Three reds for depth, yikes. This is basically my biggest fear, but it made sense considering I haven\u2019t box skwatted all cycle. It moved great, but I was there for a total, so I re-took this weight for my second attempt to extra-avoid bombing out. \n\n\\-185kg\/407.85lbs redux: Buried it, three whites, moved great. My planned second attempt was 195kg\/429.9lbs, and my planned third was 200kg\/440.92lbs, but I kept it conservative and decided to sacrifice the 200kg attempt for the sake of the goal total. \n\n\\-195kg\/429.9lbs: Two whites, one side red for depth. Moved great, 2.5kg PR. I think 200kg would have for sure been there, but it\u2019s hard to be upset with a PR, especially when it means building for the total. \n\n**Bench:** \n\n\\-115kg\/253.53lbs: Three whites, absolutely flew, no notes.\n\n\\-120kg\/264.55lbs: Three whites, 2.5kg PR, moved very well (especially off the chest, which is where I usually struggle). It felt like it slowed a bit half-way, but it was hard to see any deceleration in the video. Decided to do a 5kg jump, vice 2.5kg, since it felt so good and I needed it to keep a realistic shot at 1,200. \n\n\\-125kg\/275.58lbs: Three whites, 5kg PR, definite deceleration through the mid-range, but it moved well enough that I think \\~280 may\u2019ve been there. That said, I am very, very pleased with this lift, since I traditionally suck eggs at bench and \u201ctwo plates and a quarter\u201d has been a goal for a while. This meant that I only had a sub-PR deadlift between me and my goal total. \n\n**Deadlift:** \n\n\\-212.5kg\/468.48lbs: Three whites, moved fast, but felt heavier than I like openers to. I think I need to reframe my perception of how openers should subjectively feel. At any rate, I made the jump to secure the 1,200lb total. \n\n\\-225kg\/496.04lbs: Three whites. I knew this was there, so I wasn\u2019t intellectually worried about getting the total, but I was still much more nervous than usual, going into the lift. It moved well and bagged me 1,200. I decided to go for the PR for the third attempt. \n\n232.5kg\/512.57lbs: Three whites. In my first USPA meet (same judges), I had to pull 227.5 twice, because I ramped on my second attempt. I\u2019ve been very paranoid about ramping since, and midway through this lift, I thought I let my knees stay under the bar a bit too long. Apparently, that wasn\u2019t the case. After a case of the shakes, I locked it out and walked away with the DL and total PR. \n\n**Summary:** \n\nSuper happy with this meet. It went way better than it had any business going, considering the long break from lifting I took last year. I finally got 1,200 with a 552.5kg\/1,218.05lb total and I feel like the pressure is off, so now I can focus on just pushing each lift and building the total, as opposed to reaching for a certain number (even though I think that good Class I is within reach), if that makes sense. This was the last meet I\u2019ll get to do with the Spohrers from NC\/VA USPA. Like all the meets I\u2019ve done with them, it was excellent and I will miss lifting with them, they\u2019re awesome. I think the plan for me is to program assuming I\u2019ll do a meet in September\/October and make the call on what that meet is based on if the USPA can sort out their garbage or if I\u2019ll hop over to WRPF (I really don\u2019t want to go back to USAPL. Deadlifting with a shirt makes me sad). Moving forward in training, I think I\u2019m going to prioritize upper-back and hips and also skwat a little deeper in the gym. \n\nThanks for reading!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676855665.0},{"title":"Meet Report - USAPL Central Florida Open | 37 M | 607.5 kg\/1340 lbs @ 88.7 kg\/195.5 lbs | 395.73 Dots | Raw","author":"Ghostwind27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/116lx4q\/meet_report_usapl_central_florida_open_37_m_6075\/","text":"TLDR: Had a great 2nd meet yesterday, added 45 kg to my total and hit my meet goals of breaking 300# on bench (137.5 kg) and 600kg total. Also took a swing at 600# on deadlift but gassed out. \n\nComp Prep: \n\nThree months of offseason work with a small bulk up to 90kg. Focus was improving bench primarily and keeping my thoracic nerves healthy and happy as I had an injury last time I bulked up to 90. Biggest challenge for me was hip issues with squats, and I tweaked my neck 1 week out which ruined my last SBD session. Not an ideal lead in to meet but oh well.  Not having to cut was super nice. I had breakfast and fluids in the morning and still was 1.3kg under at weigh in.\n\nComp Day: \n\nTop Lifts:  https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Co2fXFQOk1Q\/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link  \n\nSquats: 192.5 \/ 202.5 \/ 210 - 9 White Lights\n\nShook off my nerves on the 1st, 2nd was a small PR and it was ugly as the bar was sitting wrong and went crooked on me. 3rd was my best and probably had 2.5-5kg in the tank. Was so happy to get through these without any pain. \n\nBench: 127.5 \/ 132.5 \/ 137.5 - 9 White Lights\n\nOpening with my 3rd attempt from September was nice. Head ref was strict for our session. Any left\/right movement and he'd hold the press, and slow start commands. 6 lifters before me and 1 after red lighted their 3rds. Fortunately I'd practiced long pauses so we got through it, but ended up going conservative on the numbers so I didn't get to try the 142.5 I wanted. \n\nDeads: 245 \/ 260 \/ 272.5 - 6 White Lights\n\nOpened 10kg over my 3rd attempt from September. Opener flew. Second (shown) I lost positioning off the floor but it still moved fine. Coach told me to take 2.5-5kg but I really wanted to try 600# so we just went with it. As expected I gassed out in the 10 minutes before the final lift and ended up getting it just below the knee. Pretty confident I'll break 600 next comp though. \n\n\\--------------\n\nWrap-Up: Finished easily in 2nd for my class, a good improvement from 2nd to last in September.  My coach and the Osano Training Concepts team handled me for the event which was amazing. I just had to listen to them and lift when\/what I was told to. Honestly I felt a little unworthy of the treatment as a new lifter but it was nice.  \n\n10\/10 Highly Recommend this meet for anyone competing in Florida. Texas Strength Systems ran a great, smoooooth meet. Their equipment, spotters\/loaders, emcee, and crowd were top notch. Communication and timing were crystal clear and they gave us plenty of room for warming up and resting.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676835661.0},{"title":"Weekly Dumb\/Newb Question Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/116usfp\/weekly_dumbnewb_question_thread\/","text":"**Do you have a question and are:**\n\n* **A novice and basically clueless by default?**\n* **Completely incapable of using google?**\n* **Just feeling plain stupid today and need shit explained like you're 5?**\n\n**Then this is the thread FOR YOU!** Don't take up valuable space on the front page and annoy the mods, ASK IT HERE and one of our resident \"experts\" will try and answer it.

As a powerlifter, I compete in multiple federations and have friends who compete in various other feds, so I wanted a one-stop-shop to find all the upcoming powerlifting meets.\n\nThis website has been extremely useful to me for a few reasons. First, I can quickly see all the upcoming meets in one place, rather than having to search through various federations' websites. Second, I can see meets happening in different states, which is great for when I travel and want to find local meets to compete in. Lastly, I can stay informed on what's going on in the powerlifting community and share that information with others who may be interested.\n\nSo, my question for this community is: is this website useful to anyone else? Would you use it or recommend it to others? Do you have any suggestions for changes or improvements that would make it even better?\n\nYour feedback is greatly appreciated. I hope this resource can be a helpful tool for the powerlifting community.

Lost some weight and felt like shit until paxlovid did it's thing.  Wasn't sure I would be able to do the meet until the day before weigh ins when I finally tested negative.  I have a garage gym so I was able to do some light training the week of the meet and I felt like I would be good to go if I dialed openers down and just tried not to put too much pressure on myself.  I lost weight during COVID so I was only 1kg over 100 - all I needed was an evening gut cut and I did the garbage bag\/spit bottle on the way to the venue just to make sure.  Made weight at 98.8 and had started reconstituting myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my PL gym homies handled me for the meet and it really helps a lot to have a training partner who knows you well there to ride it out with you.  Big ups to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nSQUAT\n\nI nearly bombed out of my last meet on squat depth so it was very much in my head all prep.  This is my 8th meet since 2014 when I started pl and my stomach is always in absolute knots until I get my first squat passed.  Hadn't touched anything heavy for a couple weeks so I figured I would just open light and see where I'm at.  200kg felt a little wobbly and lopsided but I buried depth and got two white lights (lol).  Moved up to 212.5.  last time I did this meet 212.5 was my third attempt and I dropped the wrap right before stepping onto the platform, re-wrapped and missed the weight.  Took it yesterday and smashed it for two whites again (hehe).  500lbs was a goal weight for me before COVID but I was really committed to being more sane than normal and trying to build my total so I took 220kg for a ride and it was slow but easy as far as third attempts to.  Two whites again and I felt great. Don't think I'd gone 3\/3 on squats since 2018 so I was very happy.\n\n&#x200B;\nBENCH\n\nBench was the biggest casualty of COVID during prep.  My elbows have been really tender for years due to recurring tendonitis and when I got the COVID aches the inflammation was insane even when I wasn't lifting at all.  I also lost 5-6lbs which hurts strength but honestly hurts my joints worse.  I took 135 as an opener and crushed it for 3 whites. 140 for seconds was fine but super lopsided as my left side was the elbow that was barking the loudest.  I was tempted to cut it and skip thirds but I was convinced to just yolo 142.5 because 5lbs is 5lbs. Went back to the warmup room and tried just flossing the shit out of my elbow but I missed the attempt without much fight.   It was pretty humbling since 142.5 is a weight I have tripled before, but I'm trying to just learn from it and not beat myself up too bad.\n\n&#x200B;\nDEADLIFT\n\nDeadlifts are usually my baby but I have had a very up and down prep with them after a very up and down couple training cycles.  Basically I have been having issues where my left hip locks up and refuses to internally rotate enough to get in position to transfer force into the ground.  When this happens I basically get no quad recruitment out of my left side and it becomes an SLDL.  I have been working on this for a long time and have had periods where it plays nice and periods where the rehab\/corrective stuff has been ineffective.  If anything, I thought it was under control at the end of this prep so I didn't keep up as much with rehab stuff as I should have.  Anyway, took 250kg as an opener and it was .....slow and stiff legged.  I knew my leg drive wasn't there but I was still in the game.  Got two white and one red but I was too jacked up to ask the judge what the red was for. 260 was my planned second so it took it and it was a grinder but I hit it.  Unfortunately, this time I got two reds.  The judge explained to me that it was the same issue as my first - I yanked the bar too aggressively on my slack pull and judges considered it a bona fide attempt.  Per rulebook 4.5.2 at least one plate needs to be in contact with the ground on the slack pull.  Insta might have cut out the vid so here is the full second attempt:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/0O\\_h38aZbA0?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/0O_h38aZbA0?feature=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was pissed, but it was my fault for not checking with the judge after my first red light (always do this!).  I knew I wasn't going to match my meet pr of 275 with my hip acting up, but I knew I wasn't going to miss weight so I called for it again.  Since I wasn't getting any drive out of my left side I set up even more lopsided on thirds and stiff legged it all the way up.  This time it got whites and I lost my mind screaming like a maniac.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeadlifts were bittersweet because it felt amazing to come back and hit 260 on thirds when it looked like I emptied the tank on second attempts, but to be honest my strength felt good yesterday despite everything.  If I was more diligent with hip stuff I would have been good for 275+ and an all time PR total.  At the end of the day though I was only 5kg off my best total so I should be happy given the circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm getting married this year and have a pretty busy calendar ahead so not sure when the next meet will be.  I do know I want to make some changes to my training and programming.  I train at home with some self-programmed conjugate stuff. I think the big change I need is to incorporate more submaximal training more of the time.  Weekly max effort is great for developing the grinding gear and top end strength but when your elbow is hurting or your hip is beat up, any slow and hard lift regardless of variation is going to inflame it more.  Conjugate is great for training around injuries but it's only as effective as the maniac doing the programming.  Its been a long time since I've done any extended submaximal training so I'm thinking of going on autopilot and maybe doing a 10 week sheiko cycle or something similar with a little more variation.   Also as much as I love competing in wraps I think I can beat that 220 squat after a sleeves cycle or two (have hit 210 in the gym in sleeves).  Wraps are a lot easier on my knees (left knee has had 3 surgeries), but I'm curious about trying the new generation of meme sleeves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally regarding USPA: absolutely sick of their shit regarding the wave of abuse and enabling that has been exposed.  I am not sure I will ever do another uspa meet.  However, I really appreciate the meet director for the Pendleton open, which is held at Iron Mongers gym.  Rick is a good dude who genuinely cares and that makes a huge difference in running a good gym and putting on a good meet. Hope uspa gets their act together because I would like to keep competing at iron mongers events.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675101294.0},{"title":"Daily Thread - January 30, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/10pate3\/daily_thread_january_30_2023\/","text":"A sorta kinda daily open thread to use as an alternative to posting on the main board.

I want to compete eventually, and I'm thinking about how programming works generally + for peaking. For example, I'm closing in on my 4 plate  squat, but I've never really come to understand where exactly my progress happens. Last time I PR'd, I felt like I was turning my wheels for months trying to find a training block where I could make progress. I was modifying variables during 3-6 week blocks and expecting to see progress. Nothing seemed to work. Then, I ran a version of the Cube method with significantly reduced volume \/ high intensity top sets, and my strength on every lift exploded. \n\nWould you all who've trained powerlifting successfully agree that the basic, distilled protocol is to start with moderately challenging weights \/ reps \/ sets, progressively overload for a block of time (say, 6-15 weeks), and cut volume \/ increase intensity to set PR's? Then rinse and repeat with tweaks as needed? It's seems so simple and I feel dumb for asking, but it feels so puzzling sometimes when I really know it's not.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1672129524.0},{"title":"Daily Thread - December 27, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/zwhirk\/daily_thread_december_27_2022\/","text":"A sorta kinda daily open thread to use as an alternative to posting on the main board.

In 2021 I competed at the same meet (USPA Winter War 2021) but at 75kg which I had to water cut too. 2 months after the 2021 meet I decided I needed to lose weight now in order to benefit in the long run. By March 2022 I went from 172lbs to 150lbs and felt like a new person. I knew losing the weight was necessary and would allow me to put on more lean tissue over the next couple\nyears so I could fill out my frame to be the best lifter I can be. Anyways, leading up to the meet my walk around weight was 150-153lbs. I ran Jeff Nippard\u2019s Powerbuilding program, 6 Week Candito, and used SSTT\u2019s 8 Week Peaking Program to lead up to my meet. Strength came back nicely after losing the weight and I was able to improve on all my lifts with being 20lbs lighter.\n\n**Weigh Ins**\n\nI decided to water cut the remaining ~5lbs of weight to make 67.5kg and it went pretty well. I follow Alex Bromley\u2019s water cutting protocol and it never fails. I suffered a good bit on Thursday due to fasting the majority of the day and doing hot baths, but we pushed through and weighed in at 146.6lbs. I was the very first person to weigh in (second was Liam Newell LOL) so I had a full 24 hours to refeed. To summarize, I ate about 6k calories of mainly carbs and drank 2 Pedialytes, 2 Liquid IVs, and 1.5 Gallons of water. I made sure I\u2019d have a nice bloat for meet day.\n\n**Meet Day**\n\nSlept well the night before and woke up ready to compete. Going back to the PWRBLD gym was a fantastic idea as I was familiar with the layout of the meet and the energy the meets there have. I was ready.\n\n**Squat**\n\nSquat 1: 413.3 | Good + JR State Record\nMoved VERY EASY\n\nSquat 2: 434.5 | Good + JR State Record\nPlayed it safe with my 2nd, the most I ever hit in the gym was 470 but that was on a power bar and pound plates. I wanted to build some momentum\n\nSquat 3: 457.5 | Good + JR & Open State Record\nMoved pretty good also. I think I had ~470ish in the tank but I\u2019ll take 3\/3 on Squats\n\n**Bench**\n\nBench 1: 275.6 | Good\n\nBench 2: 292.2 | Good + JR State Record\nMoved fairly nice. Nice enough for me to attempt an All Time PR on my 3rd\n\nBench 3: 308.2 | No Lift\nIf I had a 4th Attempt\u2026 I get this. Almost grinded it out but just couldn\u2019t lock it out\n\n**Deadlift**\n\nDeadlift 1: 413.3 | Good\nMoved liked butter\n\nDeadlift 2: 446.4 | Good\n\nDeadlift 3: 485 | Good\nThis moved so nice. Deadlift is my worst lift, even though it\u2019s my favorite, but it was very inconsistent when it came to heavy singles in training so I was happy it was there on meet day.\n\n**Total: 1234.7lbs | 437 DOTS**\n\n**Summary**\n\nJr State record total with Meet PRs on every lift\n+ 3 more State records. Very happy with the performance and even happier about the 437 DOTS considering I could care less about the State Records. A successful meet with no injuries. Off-season going to be a little longer I think focusing on putting on some lean tissue to try to fill my frame out and be the strongest 75kg or 82.5kg lifter there is (I\u2019m only 5\u20196\u201d ain\u2019t no way I can get above 82.5kg lean lol).","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671123369.0},{"title":"Daily Thread - December 15, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/zmz449\/daily_thread_december_15_2022\/","text":"A sorta kinda daily open thread to use as an alternative to posting on the main board.

I tried out a few different programs like Unity, nSuns, and CAP3 before coming back to GZCL's UHF 5 week in the Summer. I also took part in a strongman competition in April as a novice lightweight and had a great time (finished like 12 out of 13!). I decided to do this meet again sometime around June\/July, signed up, and started lining up my programming for it. Doing a meet once a year seems to me enough for me at this stage.\n\n**Meet Prep**\n\nSince I've done it before with success, I decided to use GZCL's 9 week UHF program with the optional 3 week taper to peak for this meet. I enjoy this type of split, and I know I respond well to it. Everything went well until about the last two weeks when I somehow hurt something in my left trap\/clavicle area (which I'm still dealing with). It seems that anything that pulls my arm forward or down aggravates it, so I had to pull back on the programmed deadlift volume to try and help it recover enough for the meet. Luckily, it didn't seem to have any issues with squat and bench. I hit squat and bench openers the Monday before the meet and then some light warmups on S\/B\/D on that Wednesday. My main goal going into this meet was to get a 400+ DOTS score and hit some PRs on my lifts.\n\n**Meet Day**\n\nThis meet was at Everyday Athletes in Louisville, KY, which is the gym I go to. Last year it had like 120 lifters split between two platforms that took all day. This year only about 70 people signed up, so they did one platform split into morning and afternoon sessions. I weighed in at 78.0 Kg exactly, so I was in the morning session and in the second of two flights. I like this schedule a lot better since we were done with everything by about 12:30 pm.\n\n**Squats**\n\nI think this was the first meet where I went in with full confidence in my squats\n\n* 1st Attempt: [187.5 kg \/ 413 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1v5naKM9nvyc6cFHyarfeYjGZ6oEXSBFc\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. \n\n* 2nd Attempt: [200 Kg \/ 441 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1Bkv825ml6OYH2YTMb9RicQrNDbR7zQuq\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. This matched my best squat from my last meet. I had no doubt I would miss since I had also hit this for a few during the 2nd week of the taper.\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [207.5 kg \/ 457 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1KScU6cRw9VljdCxY9eEJDnA-JH2qouYq\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 7.5 kg meet and personal PR! My squat 1RM is not closer to 500lbs than it is to 400lbs, so I'm happy with that.\n\n**Bench**\n\n* 1st Attempt: [117.5 kg \/ 259 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1MC1g81sAZFSQJgP67uDSINTVR_BxQ4s-\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. \n\n* 2nd Attempt: [122.5 Kg \/ 270 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/10g_fTXFACrmRtonbyUcMEVf8sHpz3EPE\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. Not a PR, but I was happy that worst case I would be coming away with a better bench result than last meet.\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [127.5 kg \/ 281 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1DvownD_zDDm9d9ypuzyLze-aGDIwTzZA\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 2.5 kg meet and personal PR. This is now the 3rd time that I have set a bench PR in a meet after running GZCL 9 week UHF + 3 week taper.\n\n**Deadlift**\n\nMy shoulder was feeling okayish during warmups, so I knew I should be able to at least get through all of my attempts.\n\n* 1st Attempt: [227.5 kg \/ 502 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1zpW01sS4UzwG1hIlW2pmzZebRPeTrnDn\/view?usp=share_link) - Good.\n\n* 2nd Attempt: [240 kg \/ 529 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1whRjTbgD8PacsXLQ1di9dIKKwsJgQ6KY\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 2.5kg meet and personal PR!\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [250 kg \/ 551 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1xCNNSXQSjRAq6DIFqAkLd9jEULZtUzz-\/view?usp=share_link) - Miss. It was moving until it wasn't. I tried as much as I could, but I just was not strong enough to lock it out. I felt my grip starting to slip too, so I'm not sure I would be able to hold on to it even if was able to get to lockout. My shoulder was not happy either lol.\n\n**Summary**\n\nI went 8\/9 with a 575 kg \/ 1267 lb total, a 402 DOTS score and PRs on everything. With how training went, I was hoping for a bigger deadlift PR; but now I have a future goal. \n\nGoing forward, I've jumped back into UHF 5 week and plan to just run that for the foreseeable future. Deadlifts are on the backburner for at least a cycle so that whatever is going on with my left trap\/clavicle\/whatever can heal. I think it's probably and overuse type strain. I really enjoyed this meet, but I did not come out of it rushing to sign up for another one. Part of that could be due to the fact that I am already signed up for a half-marathon in April. I might feel differently by the Summer, so I won't be surprised if I decide to sign up for this meet again next year.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671035770.0},{"title":"Daily Thread - December 15, 2022","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/powerlifting\/comments\/zmaby7\/daily_thread_december_15_2022\/","text":"A sorta kinda daily open thread to use as an alternative to posting on the main board.

Been on HRT for over four years now. As a teen I did some personal training that included bench press and kind of fell in love with it. However I had severe mental and physical health problems. Pre transition 1RMs were 70\/65\/90, at over 100kg bodyweight. Mind you I technically had low enough T that I could have competed in the olympics BEFORE HRT \ud83d\ude33. Also breast growth. My body was a mess!!\n\nStarted back at the gym in May 2021 after a few years on HRT, weaker and less muscular than ever but more motivated to get strong. It felt amazing! I had tried the whole \u2018petite feminine no muscles\u2019 thing to try and \u2018pass\u2019 better... it wasn\u2019t me. I\u2019m never going to be that girl. And it just made me depressed and gain weight anyway. The reddit powerlifting community has been so amazing as well. I\u2019ve gotten a little inactive in the past few months but I\u2019ve just been so so busy in the real world. Signed up for a powerlifting novice meet and coaching in August 2022 after losing 15kgs (and regaining 5). At that point four months ago I couldn\u2019t even squat to depth at all, with any weight. So I was still very much a beginner.\n\n1RMs in august were 120(three quarter depth \ud83d\udc40)\/70\/132.5. All were very sketchy. Squat wasn\u2019t to depth so wouldn\u2019t count, butt may not have been touching on bench, and I think I hitched the deadlift. I honestly can\u2019t remember but I know they were very messy!\n\nMaxes in early December were 105\/70x5\/135 all with much nicer form.\n\nPrep!\n\nI did some general form work to make sure I could squat to depth, find my best grip width for bench, etc. etc. for the first month with my coach before diving into a 12 week meet prep. 6 weeks of high rep SBD, lots of \u2018skill work\u2019. Then I did a few weeks of light singles to really work on form and cues. Then it was 2 weeks of heavy triples, before doing a big deload for the last two weeks.\n\nI was bulking during that entire time and came back up to 114.9kg on the day (with a full stomach and bladder! I didn't really care what weight I was). Highest weight last year was 120, lowest was 105. Ideally I would like to compete in the -110kg class, or just not care either way, but for a novice comp we don\u2019t use weight classes so I figured I would maximise my gains and recovery since I had such limited time.\n\nMEET DAY!\n\nHad a big breakfast and drove down to meet my coach and the team. She had seven athletes in one flight (god I hope none of you are here to see my post history. But if you are, you're all amazing!! Thank you so much for the experience!), with 2 others to assist with warmups, knee wraps, etc. they were amazing! And as an online client with no local community it was so fun to be around so many passionate powerlifters. I\u2019d always been worried I would be judged or looked down on because of my history, but as far as I can tell not a single person gave a damn! I would 100% encourage any other trans women who are nervous about sports - just reach out and see! I've also had other athletes try to recruit me to come have fun in entirely different sports. Sometimes people will surprise you with how accepting they can be. Surround yourself with THOSE people.\n\nComp was to GPC rules, so knee wraps allowed. Being a novice comp they were relaxed about clothing requirements.\n\nSquats!\n\nMy least competent lift but I was feeling good. Normally I can get 5, maybe 6 revolutions in knee wraps myself. My wrapper on the day managed 8. It hurt a lot but helped make up for my relatively weak quads. I really like wraps not for the boost in numbers (but that is also nice), but because equipment complicates things! I had to learn a whole new stance and bracing, as well as the skill of wrapping itself. It completely overhauls my squat in a fun way. Keeps things interesting.\n\n97.5kg\/214lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nEasy. No problem at all. Was a little too far back in the monolift but nothing I couldn\u2019t easily handle. I normally walk out in my local gym.\n\n105kg\/231lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nWas a little off centre but my back spotter told me to adjust to the right before I unracked. Legend. Absolutely flew. No problems. Started to just feel in the zone. At this point I wasn\u2019t even checking what weight my coach was nominating, or if I had gotten white lights. Didn\u2019t even realise there were a hundred and something people watching or that I had a man 3 inches from my ass. I honestly forgot about anything but squatting and going where I was meant to be.\n\n110kg\/242lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nI had a tonne more in me. Heard my back spotter comment that it was way too easy. I agree - but I\u2019m also very happy we played it safe and conservative. I was a nervous wreck and I\u2019ve never had somebody give commands or wrap me that tight before.\n\nBench.\n\nBy far my most competitive lift and the one I\u2019m most passionate about. That may have gotten me into some trouble. Goal was 67.5-75-80 if everything was going absolutely perfect.\n\n67.5kg\/148lbs \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\n\nAaaand things did not go perfect. I jumped my \u2018rack\u2019 command. Like I said, I was in the zone. And my zone at home doesn\u2019t have anybody giving commands. I just blanked on that part. What made it worse was watching every judge give me white lights, then quickly change them to red when they saw what I did at the very end. The lift itself was very easy. Another lifter before me had jumped the rack command and gotten away with it 2-1, so they were definitely on guard for me.\n\nI was pretty pissed with myself. I had never gone over 70kg in the gym and wanted to push my limits on the day. Part of me wanted to just jump ahead to 75 right now but even I knew that was a dumb idea. My coach told me if my second moved insanely well she would let me jump all the way to 80.\n\n67.5kg\/148lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nEasy peasy. Waited for the command this time. Let the admin team know I was jumping to 80kgs, walked back around to find the scoreboard reading \u201875kg\u2019. I was kinda mad. My coach overruled me. Frankly it was the right call!! She KNEW I had 75 but was not very confident in 80. At all. Based on how 67.5 moved. And let\u2019s be real, I had a bit of an ego issue with bench, and coming away with 67.5 - well under my gym PB - I would have been an emotional wreck.\n\n75kg\/165lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nIt went well. Anger is a good pre workout! I went and had a little cry around the corner because I was emotional, and ended up having a heart to heart with a fellow lifter who had missed all of his benches. He had ALSO ran around the corner to escape and have a quiet moment. Kind of put things in perspective! The adrenaline had just got to us both. I realised at this point that frankly, 75 was the right play. I definitely had it in me. I think I had 77.5 for sure. And on a PERFECT day, 80. I don\u2019t know that today was a perfect day. It might have happened, but it was probably a 50\/50 shot. 75 was the right call. And I also need to let go of arbitrary goals. \"80kg\" is a unit we made up. It's not twice as good as 79kg (which is what it feels like in my brain), it's a little more than 1% higher. For some people big round numbers are an amazing motivator. On the other hand I am pretty mentally ill, and I think I personally need to step back from that mindset. Once a few tears came out I came to my senses, went and gave my coach a hug and apology, and got my mind back in the game for deadlifts. I didn\u2019t ever snap or argue with her or anything, but I had been a bit cold between attempts. She was so amazing the entire time and 75kg was 100% the best move for me.\n\nDeadlifts!\n\nI had vomited in my mouth twice by this point. I had way too much caffeine and salt and food. Queensland summer heat with no air con did not help at all. We were all drenched in sweat. Lesson learned. But warmups moved well... ish. Coach had said 120-135-?? But I thought 135 seemed generous.\n\n120kg\/264lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nMoved smoothish but something was off. I vomited before I even started to lift, so that sucked. Just getting my brace was enough to force it up. Coach put in 130kg for my second attempt - the right move.\n\n130kg\/286lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nMy bracing and lat engagement were better here. Moved just as fast and smooth as 120 and with no vomiting! Knew I had it in me now to try for a solid PB.\n\n140kg\/308lbs \u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\u26aa\ufe0f\n\nSlower than the last, but solid! Felt fantastic. Waited for the lights and walked off feeling relief. 3 metric plate deadlift conquered, with perfect form, and not even a grind. My first ever meet was finished and I had put up a total! So happy with my deads.\n\nRealistically I probably could have put another 7.5kg on squat, 2.5 on bench, and 5 on deadlift quite easily, if I had known how I would perform under pressure. Maybe even 12.5\/5\/10 if I had been in absolutely perfect condition, but I wasn\u2019t! And I was happy to leave a little extra weight on the platform in retrospect. I\u2019m so so happy with my total for the day, regardless of the hiccup on bench press! I\u2019m not quitting any time soon, so my arbitrary little goal will come eventually. In the meantime, I won't even be attempting it for months as I'm heading into a long cut - will be an interesting exercise in controlling my ego.\n\nAll in all I think competing was an incredibly positive experience! The training itself really motivated me and gave me something to focus on! I was more committed, and eating healthier than ever (\u2018healthy\u2019 relative. 4,000 calories a day was still pretty horrific for my bowels and blood pressure even with healthy foods. IBS gang \ud83e\udd22). I felt connected to things more and was more mindful throughout the entire process. And the people I met on the day were all just so fantastic. It has almost given me a new lease on life, and I 100% want to keep participating in some form of sport for many many years, even if I end up deviating from powerlifting. I am so keen to compete again, and in a sanctioned meet this time. I\u2019m thinking of taking quite a big period to cut down to maybe 105 again, then prepping for a meet at -110 in June? Perhaps. Or I just stop caring about weight class entirely. I'm not breaking any records, it doesn't really matter. While staying at 115 year round and cutting to 110 would be the most \"competitive\" approach for my height (or permabulking to 150+), but I feel better at 105. Might even feel better at 99. At 115 I wake up in pain from my weight pressing on me all night, my bowels are a nightmare from the extra food, and I'm just more sluggish. Depressed. At this stage I'm not cutting for looks or aesthetics, but for the health and wellbeing benefits - and hopefully I can come to have a better relationship with my body that doesn't revolve around risking my physical and mental health just to try and put up a bigger total.\n\nI\u2019m giving myself and my coach a week or so to relax and unwind before I commit to any plans. Time to eat and sleep and enjoy the holiday season!
