I want to find a quality automatic or solar watch that isn't dressy, just an everyday design that isn't too big or too small. Ideally it would be in the $500 range. My seiko orange monster is too small, my citizen BM8475-26E, I love, but too small. The Hamilton Khaki is too small. The U-boats look great, but a little too pricey right now. The BR-1 also great, but pricey.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.",

But if you look inside a Rolex the name says “Montres Rolex S.A.” which basically translates as “Rolex Watch Co. Ltd”\nMeanwhile if you go to the Patek Phillippe website you get “Luxury Watches for Men &amp; Ladies” in the website description.\n\nSo who is actually calling them timepieces? Where did this term come from!? If you google “watch vs timepiece” most of the articles are nonsense and just support the pretension while ignoring the fact that actual luxury watchmakers are still calling themselves watchmakers!\n\nAppreciate your thoughts/opinions even if you downvote me to hell 🙈",
