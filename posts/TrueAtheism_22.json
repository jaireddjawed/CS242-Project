There are some very large gaps that I don't have good answers for or mental pictures of. My mind goes from some fuzzy notion of ape-like humans, then something like a first man and woman that is all too close to Adam and Eve as shown in christian children's videos.Then my mental record jumps to the the Hebrews leaving Egypt(which is another questionable historical point), and to the Greeks and Romans. (And then jumps to Medieval period which makes its way to now). \n\nBut most of that is an /r/history. What I am looking for is a realistic and current book on early civilization and origins of man. Specifically to give me a clearer image to replace the notions of Adam and Eve. Also if there is a book that debunks or gives a side by side comparison of the biblical account of events vs a historical perspective that would be appreciated. \n\nI was thinking [Sapiens](http://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-Humankind/dp/0062316095) might be a good start but it has mixed reviews.",

        "text": "Hello, I am an Atheist who just started reddit to share my opinion. I would like to ask if afterlife sounds like a relief from  the fear of death. I have been thinking about afterlife since 5th grade, and I grew to hate the afterlife people have been talking about. I was born in a christian family and read bible often. Then I read Revelation 21:4, which stated that \"He(God) will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.\" The first thing I thought about was that I don't want to forget what I was before. I believe that memory is what makes me \"me\". I believe that I will cease to exist if i forget who I was. I am scared of heaven because I will cease to exist even in afterlife because my memory is gone. I am scared of reincarnation because it also states that you will forget about the life before reincarnation. Adults say that they still want afterlife because as you live your life there are plenty of times that you just want to disappear or forget everything. So they say they are in relief that there will be a time when they could forget everything. I just couldn't understand that. I am a senior in high school and I am still afraid of forgetting who I am. No matter what kind of memory I will have, even the memories that will make you wish to disappear, I want to hold those memory. Because that's what makes me. Therefore I am scared of afterlife as much as death. I feel trapped. Do you want afterlife? Now I don't care, because either way I know that no outcome will satisfy me. I just accept that instead of denying it by believing in religion.",

        "text": "As atheists we are generally fairly quick to point out the failings in a theistic worldview.  Whether it's the misogyny, repression of LGBT rights or religious fueled violence - we are generally quick to note these behaviors and their effects and to discuss them - often disparagingly.\n\nI somehow would have expected atheists to scream the loudest over the violence that's coming from Islamic extremists these days.  At first blush that just seems like something that atheists would do.  After all, we're pretty quick to point out the religious based climate change nonsense and the extremist Christian attempts to defund planned parenthood or even use violence against it.  \n\nYet when you browse the atheism subreddits most of what you find is actually very tempered and moderate.  While the Christian extremists are screaming wildly about Muslims we atheists seem to be taking a position defending Muslims.  To be clear I don't think we are defending many of the bad ideas of Islam - but we do see through the rhetoric and can separate Muslims from Islam.  There are exceptions, of course, but most of the feeling I get from the atheist community is recognition that in any large group there is going to be a certain number of lunatics.  Certainly the religious teachings can cause radicalization but that's true of Christianity and Judaism as well.\n\nI find this quite refreshing.  Atheists seem to be in an almost unique position during these troubling times.  We've seen the violence and the harm come from almost all religions - and we seem well able to separate the harm that is 'religion' - regardless of flavor - from 'religious nutbars'.  \n\nMaybe it's just my take - but it seems that atheists have a far more nuanced take on today's problems than the religious do.",

The way that a person feels God is more similar to the way that a person feels like someone is going to kill them after they watch a scary movie. A rebuttal that I could see someone giving would be something along the lines “A person’s heart is a wind meter that can measure God”. To this I would say that you can put several wind meters outside and get a similar reading. But if you send a bunch of people out to measure the spirit of God they will come back with different readings. Some people might think that they are consistent but that is could be because they go to a place where everyone thinks like them or is expected to think like them and they are told that anyone who doesn’t get the same reading on their God-o-meter has something wrong with them.\n\nEDIT: \"God\" was originally \"Air\" one of the times. typo\n",

What if you were a hostage in a bank robbery? What if you were at a restaurant or grocery store when terrorists broke in and started killing people? Wouldn’t you wish you had a gun then?*\n\nEquivalent to people why can't let [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) and similar fantasy \"risks\" go  - *\"But what if a vengeful God is really going to burn me for all eternity if I make the wrong choice?\"* \n\nMany adults \n\n&gt;think about risk the way that children think about monsters in their closets. \n\n&gt;In that mode of thought, the problem isn’t the real-life probability of danger, it’s that a dark fantasy has gotten into your head and you can’t get it out. \n\n&gt;If you’ve ever dealt with a frightened child or remember being one, you know that you can’t solve a closet-monster problem by finding statistics to demonstrate how low being-eaten-by-a-closet-monster ranks among childhood death risks. Instead, **you need to come up with some talisman or ritual that creates an aura of safety.**\n\nSound  familiar?  \n\n&gt;The child needs a security blanket or a teddy bear, not more accurate information about relative risks. ...\n\n&gt;The point isn’t that [fantasized monsters,  or fantasized] home invasion is a major risk in your life ... it’s that when the home-invasion fantasy plagues you, you can tell yourself, *“It’s OK. I have a gun.”*\n\nWhen you're afraid of illness, loneliness, poverty, demons, ridicule, death, whatever,  you can tell yourself *\"It's okay.

        "text": "So I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago.  I was exhausted from a 14hr flight and my wife and I sat down next to a woman in the terminal waiting area.  I commented to my wife that I could sure use a coffee except all I saw in the terminal was Tim Horton's and I made some disparaging remark about Tim Horton's coffee.\n\nThe lady next to me lifted her coffee cup up.  When I saw it I immediately apologized if I'd offended her - I hadn't seen the cup and would have kept my mouth shut if I'd known she had one.\n\nShe pointed out that the cup she was holding was *not* a Tim Horton's cup but, rather, a Starbucks cup.  I tried to make the situation light by saying 'Oh no! not the solid red Starbuck's cup that's making right wing extremist Christian's heads explode'.  \n\nShe replies that SHE is a right wing Christian extremist and she doesn't care about the cup.\n\nThe conversation is deteriorating here so I say something like 'Well you can't be a card carrying right wing Christian extremist if you don't hate the cup' and I let the conversation drop - wishing I'd kept my mouth shut in the first place.\n\nShe wants to go at it, though, and she says that 'the cup isn't the problem - it's the chiseling away of Christian values in society that's the problem'.\n\nWell - I was tired and not in the mood so I simply said to her 'You might not feel so attacked if you stopped calling 'human' values 'Christian' values.  Those values belong to all of us - not just to you.  That sort of redefinition of human values as Christian values is pretty insulting when you think about it'.  \n\nShe didn't respond.  She fumed for a minute or two then stood up and walked over to sit elsewhere.  Finally she gets up, walks past me, and with a big smile says 'Merry Christmas!'\n\nIt cracked me up as this was clearly some sort of passive aggressive attack concealed in a holiday greeting.  I had had enough by this point so I just smiled and went back to my book.\n\nAnyways the point of this longwinded story is I was wondering if any of you feel, as I do, that sometimes 'Merry Christmas' is more than just a greeting - sometimes it really IS an attack of sorts.  How do you deal with it when you perceive it this way?",

        "text": "Tried this on /r/atheism, I don't think they like having discussions. \n\nI think we can all remember decades ago, when Christmas was more considered a universalized cultural holiday that Americans of any and all stripes were encouraged to participate in. Think of all the major cultural staple films like Die Hard, National Lampoon's Xmas, It's a Wonderful Life, Gremlins, etc., all of which are obviously not considered \"Christian\" films simply because they refer to Christmas instead of \"the holidays\". Jews have even written many of the secular Christmas carols. Christmas is also a national holiday, and most businesses close.\n\nOf course all of us atheists are fully aware that Christmas is a secularized holiday, but it seems that the culture at large has now resorted to this idea that it's specifically \"Christian\" and therefore inappropriate in public contexts, even when it's just the secular elements being involved. You have stories like [this](http://time.com/4137658/new-jersey-councilwoman-resigns-christmas-tree-lighting/) (councilwoman resigns because tree lighting is renamed to add the word \"Christmas\"), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.com/war-christmas-university-tennessee-chancellor-bans-christmas-parties-state-lawmakers-2212653) (university diversity office condemns holding Christmas parties because they are non-inclusive), and so on.\n\nThis has the effect of turning any mention of \"Christmas\" into a religious or political statement... I love Christmas, and I don't want to be associated with Christianity or the right-wing just because I happen to refer to the holiday itself.  Europe doesn't seem to have this problem... why do we? Is it because of PC attitudes, or because of the right-wing?",

        "text": "So like some others here I've spent the majority of my life as a \"christian.\" My family growing up wasn't hardcore religious or anything but we all conformed to christian ideas and believed or whatever. I would try to pray and all that as I got older because of the \"good christian\" ideology. The further into college I got I realized how silly that whole charades was. So I didn't really think about it until several months ago and it dawned on me: what the hell am I doing? Ever since I've felt freer and just happier in general that I'm not constantly pissing off some guy in the sky. \n\nI'm not a very argumentative atheist although I've definitely read a lot on here and elsewhere some comebacks for when I'm questioned. I'm generally pretty lazy when it comes to the topic because I don't care too much to argue religion. People are stubborn with the topic and it just ends up in frustration on my end. So I've developed a very passive attitude and typically don't reveal my opinions on topics.\n\nSo onto the point: as christmas and other religious holidays roll around its just sort of odd with a clearer mindset and watching/listening to all the heavy religious people go on about christmas. For example, walking into Publix today there was a bell ringer wishing everyone a merry christmas and then giving them gods blessing. Now I don't get offended at all because it's basically just them being nice and expressing their care and happiness but my instinct is to wish them a merry christmas back and say you too and all that. It's an odd feeling just smiling and waving and/or saying thank you. It's almost like I've been programmed to believe that I'm instantly rude for now giving \"gods\" blessing back to someone.\n\nTL;DR \nIm wondering how you all go about religious holidays? Isn't it kind of weird just accepting people's praises and blessings and the likes? To me it's sort of funny as if I'm role playing or something and at the same time it's almost awkward.",

        "text": "I've watched countless debates, many on the topic of God's goodness, morality, the Euthyphro Dilemma, etc. Most of these involve some discussion of the nature or source of goodness and how God can be good in spite of the existence of evil. It occurs to me that I've never heard anyone bring up the fact that God being \"good\" makes no sense in isolation. For instance, it really doesn't make sense to say God is \"good\" and leave it at that. He can only be good relative to something else, whether it be other entities, moral standards, etc. In spite of this I often see theists define his goodness in a way that doesn't entail that he is necessarily good *for us*. \n\nSo, God can be good *for* something. When believers say that \"God is good\", they can either mean that he's good for humans or not. If he's good in some sense that doesn't necessarily entail being good for humans, which they sometimes seem to imply when bringing up evil/suffering, that's irrelevant to us. So what if, in the face of extreme pain and injustice, he's still \"good\" in some abstract sense or relative to something other than our own well-being? I really wish some atheist debater would just grant God's abstract ontological goodness (or whatever) and then ask what that should look like from the human perspective. \n\nIt seems to me that the only option, from the human perspective, is skeptical theism, which opens up a huge can of worms. Namely, if we can't know God's reasons for allowing evil, then we become morally paralyzed. How can we work to prevent evil if we have no way of knowing whether it was meant to bring about a greater good? How can we know that God doesn't have good reasons for lying to us? And so on. ",

She was a strongly voiced atheist in life, she detested religion and anyone who had her as a friend on Facebook knew it. I was surprised when I learned that my aunt had arranged the funeral in the church they all grew up in. The funeral was nothing but hymns, prayer and bible reading where the pastor assured us that no one can remove a person from Gods hands once they enter (Lutherans believe in once saved always saved and she was confirmed as a child). Finally he dedicated \"this servant of the Lord to heaven\" or something to that effect. The deceased's younger brother also had a very religious funeral about 8 years ago, but no one cared because he was vaguely Christian and one of the most easy going people you've ever met. This is different; my cousin would have flipped out if she was given foreknowledge. \n\nI know I'm not the only one who feels this way. My brother said the same thing and the deceased's sister posted the time/location on facebook with a disclaimer of \"I had no say in where the funeral would be.\" This whole thing is already a giant clusterfuck (I haven't elaborated on all the other shitty factors) and I think disrespecting my cousins memory only adds insult to injury.

        "text": "I wanted to share my experience mostly because I feel like this doesn't happen often. Hopefully it will help some of you guys out that want to have this conversation with your family/friends.\n\nI've known since sometime around sophomore year of college that I wasn't religious. I just couldn't rationalize religions so I concluded that I was an atheist. Like many of us, we keep that to ourselves because of fear of how our loved ones will react.\n\nI grew up in a home with parents who believe they are Christians though we never went to church regularly, they never taught me about the Bible, (except the old Southern sayings people say here and there), and never had a \"relationship\" with \"God\". \n\nNow, with that being said, that does not take away my parents strong opinion that God does indeed exist and Jesus is their savior etc. I guess they just feel church isn't that important? I don't know, I've never really asked.\n\nMy family and I spent the entire week of Thanksgiving together and I decided I would tell them for multiple reasons. One being that when I get married, my boyfriend and I do not want a religious wedding in any form. We just want to spend a day with family and friends celebrating the commitment we've made to each other out of love and not out of some religious obligation, which I feel would be far more genuine. I didn't want any of that to slap them in the face and be a surprise, so I felt communication was key here to ensure we could all be united.\n\n I started off by telling my brother who I thought would be most open to it, and I was right. He was \"upset\" but not yelling or debating me, just concerned for my \"soul\", but he was very understanding and listened to everything I had to say. He isn't even a \"Christian\" himself, but he believes in a God and feels like church has it all wrong. I think he just wanted me to believe in SOMETHING, you know, but was still open to it. He told me he felt like the Bible as a whole wasn't necessarily a good way to structure your life, and he believes that when bad people die that he's comfortable with the idea of those people being in hell. He isn't overly sure about Heaven because the idea of \"good\" people being in Heaven seems conflicting to him, because everyone is a sinner and does bad things etc. It was a very good conversation. He did tell me that I shouldn't ignore all of the Bible and that marriage did seem like a religious idea to him and that I should at least follow the moral guidelines. I told him that I didn't feel like my marriage had to have anything to do with \"Christian marriage ideals\" and that it was simply about my boyfriend and me. Celebrating the life we would have together as two people who love each other. He was supportive of that thought and gave me a hug and said nothing could change our relationship as brother and sister. It was really great.\n\nMy mom and dad seemed like a tougher audience, and they were. I expected my dad to accept it easier than my mom, but it was just the opposite. I think my mom already had her hunches but just never accepted it fully.\n\nThey did listen to me though but didn't ever say they understood my decision. (I guess older generations are harder to accept these things than my brother's generation and mine.) My dad seemed really, really concerned. He said all he wanted was for me to be happy but he is just so convinced of an afterlife and it bothered him to think I wouldn't be there with him. I totally understood where he was coming from, and I respect that, but it's worse to lie and say I believe it when I don't. He respected my honesty, told me he loved me, and that he was proud of who I was no matter my religious beliefs.\n\nMy mom didn't say a lot, (which being Italian is nothing short of amazing), and said that I was an adult and therefore had the right to live my life the way I deem fit. She also hugged me and said she loved me and said she would always pray for me. I told her I really appreciated it and thought that was very loving of her. We are very close so I was scared of this possibly changing our relationship. She seemed more concerned for why I decided I was an atheist, which I came to tell her the reasons. She sat quietly and nodded her head a couple of times, but never debated me. She asked about how I would raise my (potential future children), so I dropped another bombshell and said I wasn't sure I would ever have them, because my boyfriend and I are thinking about remaining child free. I told her if we did have children we would raise them to be kind and selfless, to see the world as it is but to be doers of good, and not just throw the idea of salvation at people who are in need. She asked if we would be okay with my mom and dad taking them to church. I said I didn't know, but I probably wouldn't mind. I would probably let my kids decide. I wouldn't have a problem with it, I don't think, but ultimately as adults they would have to decide what they felt was in their hearts, so it doesn't matter if I let them go or not. It should always be about an individuals choice anyways. Besides I think exposure to religion would be educational and they would be able to make an informed decision. I guess my fear is that I would hate for them to ever become something extreme and not think logically and rationally. Hopefully as a parent, I would have the ability to instill in them a healthy dose of common sense and the ability to think rationally.\n\nI was really happy with how well my family received this news. I wasn't sure how it would go, but my family doesn't typically yell or scream when they are mad, so I felt I had that on my side.\n\nAll we have to tackle now is telling my boyfriends parents! His stepmom is VERY religious and they attend church weekly and are far more committed than my parents. His stepmom is also very...umm..what's the best way to put this..overbearing? Doesn't respect boundaries?..lol So it wouldn't surprise me at all if at the wedding when she gets up to speak, that she would read from Psalms 31 or something (she's also anti-feminism, which only adds to the joy of being around here.) Oh well, can't always pick your family or control their actions! Hopefully she will be respectful that day, but if not, I will just let her know that there will have to be boundaries. Whether she respects that or not, time will tell. Thankfully, my boyfriend is completely okay with that, and even went as far to say he would tell her to leave if she did something like that! (Hopefully it wouldn't come to that.)\n\nI know everyone's families aren't as open and good at communication, so I don't necessarily have any advice, but I just wanted to share this. I'll provide an update when we tell BFs family. Hopefully it will be as smoothe. \n\nY'all have a great atheist day! ;) lol",

        "text": "I am a young (18 year old) person at that point in my life where I'm reevaluating my beliefs. I was raised in a liberal Christian home and considered myself a Christian to some degree for most of my life, besides a period of about 2 years when I believed in very naive, shallow strain of atheism. My parents are relatively deistic in their application of faith and seem to embrace church for the more social, cultural aspect of it. As such, I wouldn't say my upbringing was distinctly religious.\n\n\nFor the past few months I've moved away from Christianity because it made me feel like shit. I was done being a \"weak\" Christian and decided to become an actual Bible-reading, church-going follower of Jesus. After all, if you genuinely believe something, you should go through with what it actually stands for. After listening to some of the many voices popular in pop Christianity today (Timothy Keller, CS Lewis, NT Wright), I grew to feel, in a sense, icky about this whole strain of teaching. I felt like shit. For being gay, for disagreeing with the Bible, for disliking Christian culture– you name it. Most of all, throughout all my attempts to reach out to God, I felt nothing. No voice, no guidance, no conviction other than my budding depression that resulted from such a time. I felt inadequate, like I was doing something wrong if God didn't want to speak to me.\n\n\n It's been a difficult time as I cycle through what I believe to be true (atheism, agnosticism, deism) and try to justify it without feeling bad about abandoning my faith. I developed pretty bad depression as a result of my self-loathing and religious anxiety, so I knew moving away from whatever I previously believed could possibly help.\n\n\nI have many objections to Christian teachings and reasons not to believe, and have a pretty good understanding of both apologetics and counter-apologetics. To me, atheism is comforting. But I can't seem to free myself from the guilt and fear that through all this thinking, I'm \"running away from God.\"\n\n\nI attended a conservative Christian high school that taught what I like to refer to as \"total depravity porn.\" It's particularly dominant in America– every message boils down to \"I'm a piece of shit, but Jesus isn't, so thank God for him\". It gets weird, with people essentially bragging in a circlejerk about how horrible they are as a person, since that gives even more value to Jesus.\n\n\nMy question is, how do I respond to the teaching that has been burned into my brain that I am completely worthless, especially now that I don't have Jesus to give my life meaning? I know these are obviously non-issues for confident atheists, but I'm still struggling. I just can't get this picture of total depravity out of my mind. It seems to be a logical response to my current situation– I am currently rejecting Christianity because I am naturally a piece of shit that doesn't want to hear the \"hard\" teachings of Jesus. I don't want to think I'm a piece of shit. If someone could rationalize this, it would be great.\n\nTwo additional issues I wouldn't mind discussing if you guys have answers: how do respond to the claim that Jesus is essentially too unique and revolutionary not to be a God? That his message was so subversive and out of the blue that there's no way he could just be some guy? Other question: how do I respond to the idea that people are not Christians because the teachings of Christ are too hard for them to handle? As in, atheists are mostly just \"weak believers\" that would probably come to Christianity if they looked at it in a deeper, nuanced way.\n\n\nThese are relatively weak questions, so I'd love to hear you guys demolish them.

        "text": "(I'm really sorry for the wall of text.)\n\nI've been an atheist for the last two or three years now, but only recently came to grips with what that viewpoint entails, and I'd like a bit of help with that. It changes everything, I suppose.\n\nFirst, I sometimes get the feeling that I (and the rest of the people who agree with me) may somehow be \"fooling\" ourselves, even though every actual argument I try to cook up to show that I'm mistaken is laughable and easy to refute.\n\nSample this: my Lit teacher says today that \"I don't believe intelligent life could have come about without some intelligent force creating it\" (basically the plane-in-a-junkyard argument from The God Delusion). He's also Hindu (like I, uh,  officially am), so it's weird seeing him talk that way (unlike the American fundamentalists I've learned to fear), and it makes me think things like \"if this kind of rhetoric is so universal across religions, it just *might* be right\" and \"what if, *somehow*, all of us who're trying to fathom this intelligently and coming to a conclusion are wrong?\" It's sort of a very deep doubt that is both frightening and interesting. \n\nThe doubt hits far deeper, actually. I'm what you'd call liberal (?) in my thinking (i.e. not \"burn the gheys\"), and I'm pretty okay with that, but there are all sorts of people around me who basically insinuate that, e.g. women are somehow intrinsically inferior to men and that they're biologically designed to take care of children etc. This raises my hackles, of course, but I'm ashamed to say that I sometimes do think \"well, what if it's true and the TRPers have found some kind of great truth and we're all fooling ourselves by thinking otherwise?\" This extends to other things, too, like the fact that radiocarbon dating is fundamentally probabilistic and \"it might just all be wrong\" (although I realise why that is unmitigated BS) and . . . even the stuff about one race being superior/inferior to a few others (\"are we just being nice by suggesting that those differences don't exist?\"or even *gulp* \"what if the ideas behind Nazism were right?\"), and it makes me feel like shit. :/\n\n^ This is what creates the greater amount of disquiet, and I'd be very grateful for some help with it.\n\nIn addition, I've slumped into a sort of - um - existential crisis, where I go \"I'm going to die anyway, and there's no afterlife, and earth is going to get totally screwed *some*time in the future, so all this work is a waste of time and I should just lie down and give up\", (no, I'm not suicidal or anything!), and this coincides with a great deal of thinking about topics I'd previously considered to be the domain of philosophy and philosophers, such as what constitutes guilt, morality (\"Why should I be nice to people if there's nothing that'll punish me for it?\" \"Does this mean that I'm not a good person?\" \"What does it mean to be good?\"), etc. in addition to a sense of sad \"I don't want to die and never come back, but that's the way it is.\"\n\nOverall, it feels like I'm losing the sense of wonderment, especially in the patterns around me (I mainly study a ton of math and it's what I want to work with later, so that's what I think about most of the time) that I experienced even more strongly when I first realised that atheism was a sensible viewpoint to take, and just becoming a sad and confused kind of person.\n\nDoes anyone here have any advice for dealing with this?",

We are cursed with death and deserve hell because we all carry with us the sin of Adam. That's where Jesus comes in. He takes the punishment for original sin and gives us a way out as long as we accept it. My issue is that it's pretty well established that there was no biological Adam and Eve, so this has led many Christians to just chalk the story up to metaphor. If that story is just metaphor, then the fall of man and original sin couldn't exist and there was never a need for Jesus in the first place. How is this not an open and shut case for believers? I was wondering if any of you have any idea how Christians would respond to it, and their reasoning behind it.\n\nEdit: This question only takes into account those believers who also accept evolution, those that don't are an entirely different argument, I think.",

I'm from Ukraine, where people are all naturally atheist/deist - no one believes in a \"moral commander\" kind of God, at most father/helper type and even that vaguely [I'm myself an atheist completely but that literally doesn't matter in Ukraine] - and it looks like we have a very different attitude to death than you Westerners do. In particular, even among people who believe in God few really believe in afterlife, and it just seems obvious that when I'll die, I'll just lose consciousness. I've noticed post-Christian/Western atheists have a tendency to struggle with death - [it apparently is really a big thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory) - but that article is Western culture-specific, and I want to share some insight from our culture.\n\nIn a nutshell, we culturally distinguish between two different events that are translated \"to die\" in English: \"zahynuty\" and \"pomerty\".\n\n\"Zahynuty\" means to die *from an* ***obstruction*** *to life*. For instance, in a tragic accident, or from violence, or from a potent infectious disease or famine, etc. The logical test is something like \"if instead of being in that place at that time you were on a couch having some [borsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht) you would be fine\". This kind of death is absolutely terrifying, to us as much as to you and anyone and even to the most resolute soldiers - obviously.\n\nNow \"pomerty\" means \"to *finish* living, to die for internal reasons\". Falling unconscious from a heart attack, a stroke, or a long-lasting disease, is all \"pomerty\". Subjectively, the mentality is that my body is not *a kind of thing* that can go on forever, so this is taken as natural and obvious if only sad when it finally happens to someone you love and you can't see them anymore (but not even sad with respect to my own future death - on a relevant note unlike you Westerners we're not individualists). \n\nThe subjective difference between our attitude to \"zahynuty\" versus \"pomerty\" is just a hyped up parallel to the attitude to *being knocked unconscious with a bat* versus *falling asleep by myself*. \n\nThis all seems self-obvious to me, but I've noticed this is not so for you Americans, especially atheists.

        "text": "I'll be honest, I want to be an atheist. I'm doubting my Christian faith and atheism looks like a place of freedom and reasonable thinking. However, I know that I shouldn't make such a major decision based on that alone. \n\nHere's some things drawing me towards atheism:\n\n* Having been through a natural disaster years ago (tornado), it seemed like the most impersonal killing thing in the world. Seeing it's destruction made me think that life itself and the idea that there is a god in control ludicrous. The clean up and helping afterwards was done by humans and was certainly not perfect. Plenty of people weren't helpful despite their desire. \n\n* I'm not so sure about how reliable eyewitness testimony is when it comes to the resurrection. Since Christianity stands or falls on that, I've decided to focus my attention there. This gets in to a plethora of questions about how to determine what is factual in history or at least what is the most likely when there's a difference of opinion amongst historians. It also doesn't help that I'm not a historian. I also know about how eyewitness testimony from multiple witnesses can be wrong and how easy it is to be fooled by a charismatic teacher. Jesus was certainly a charismatic teacher. I have come to the conclusion that the disciples more than likely weren't intentionally lying but sincerely believed that he rose from the dead. \n\n* I'm sick of constantly thinking about what God thinks about my actions. I want to do good things because those things in and of themselves are good, not out of fear of eternal punishment if I don't live the Christian life properly. \n\nNow some things that are keeping me in Christianity:\n\n* I already explained a bit about the resurrection doubt. At the same time it does seem convincing and a lot of theories that try to explain what might have happened in absence of an actual resurrection seem...well, lame. The Swoon theory and the mass hallucination theory especially come across as ludicrous to me. \n\n* I have a serious lack of respect for some famous atheists. Especially Dawkins and Richard Carrier. Dawkins clearly doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to criticizing religion (though he is a brilliant evolutionary biologist). Carrier denies Jesus's existence as a historical person and is a moral degenerate (I'm specifically referring to cheating on his wife for years when he went to various conferences before suddenly discovering he was \"polyamorous\" and they divorced). Yet so many atheists hold up these people as the bastion of reason and morality. To be fair, there are atheists I do respect such as Bart Ehrman and Arif Ahmed. \n\n* I'm afraid of the emotional fallout from my family if I become an atheist. Specifically, I'm afraid my wife might leave me or treat me differently. I don't know what I would do when it comes to questions about going to church, especially since we have a one year old son. Ideally I would want to keep going but be honest with my priest and other parishioners about what I believe (or no longer believe). I wouldn't even want to try to convince her or my boy to leave the faith but to leave that decision for themselves. However, I just can't see it going well. I know for a fact it would emotionally wound her and if she forgave that she would still never forget. Deconverting would come with a major cost but I'm a person who has to know if what I'm believing or doing is right \n\nSo those are my thoughts. This seems to be a better and much more respectful subreddit than /r/atheism and I anticipate your responses and will try to answer and clarify as best as I can.",

        "text": "I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's a bit of a long story. \n\nI was raised (in the US of course) to believe in demons being behind next to everything, and during a stressful period of my life that involved revisiting a negative place from my childhood, I experienced a panic attack and subsequent anxiety attacks that a trusted friend, who was with me when they happened, said that he \"felt\" them coming on, they were demonic attacks, started praying in tongues over me, etc. And I completely bought all of that stuff back then. None of that made the anxiety go away, in fact the panic attack and anxiety attacks dissipated as they typically do for anyone who experiences them. But I didn't know what an anxiety attack or a panic attack was back then, I'd never heard of them. \n\nNow I've always been skeptical of religion, even as a religious person, and that's only increased over the years. In fact, my supposed \"spiritual experiences\" with \"the demonic\" were arguably the primary pillar of support in my belief system. \n\nHaven't dealt with anxiety or panic or anything like that in years. Also, I moved to England (i.e, not a lot of people here using the power of suggestion and persuasion in favor of these things, unlike my life in the States). So I've been relatively free of external persuasion and pressure from religion, and have been able to think clearly through a lot of things. \n\nI returned to the States a while back, was back around those same people, dealing with a difficult situation, got overstressed and ended up having a panic attack again. So I thought oh this must be some spiritual attack, started praying and taking authority over everything in Christ's name, I had complete faith that God would save me and it would all stop. Well, it didn't. And the sensations were identical to what I had dealt with all those years ago, MINUS suggestions being given to me that they were demonic, and therefore in the darkest and most insane moments of the panic I wasn't really thinking about demons. I ran into someone on the street who happened to be a doctor and explained to me that I was having a panic attack. Ended up in the hospital, the IV made it stop. I had anxiety attacks almost every day after that though, until I returned to England and to my wife. I've been a million times better since the moment I got back, but I'm still getting over a lot of it. \n\nNow since that recent experience has proven to me that it isn't spiritual, but a common and temporary condition, my faith has largely dissipated, that was all the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to my growing doubts over the years in favor of rationality and science. But those fears were implanted at an early age and the very fact that I may feel anxiety at any point initially brings demons to mind, because that was the proof of such things presented to me (even though it's obviously BS). So I'm trying to continue to pursue rationality and scientific understanding, particularly in regards to demons and demonic possession, in order to help facilitate my recovery from this crap. \n\nBut surprisingly the internet hasn't been much help. I've spend days looking for evidence against these things but page after page on Google essentially says \"oh they real, be vry afraid\". And even in the absence of those types of posts, the rest seem to be oddly open-ended, usually in favor of the fear of the unknown. Couldn't find a lot of atheistic or scientific resources that offered any sort of substantial response to things like this. \n\nConsciously, I don't believe in these things. But with anxiety, a lot of the issues root from the subconscious. So I'm in need of rational responses to the existence (or rather, non-existence) of demons and demonic possession, in order to aid my subconscious on getting a grip that this crap isn't real. So that I can sleep better at night. It might sound silly to someone who hasn't dealt with anxiety, but if you have dealt with it, you surely know how whatever you consciously and rationally think in the moment doesn't do a lot to ease the anxiety. And when you've watched shit when you were young and informative like \"The Exorcist\" or \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" or \"The Rite\" (especially bad because of the priest losing faith and being possessed as a consequence, despite all of the theological fallacies tied into that idea), having those images come to mind when dealing with anxiety or panic makes everything 1000x worse. \n\nI know this is may be a bit of a TL;DR, but if anyone feels like reading it all and giving a thoughtful response, I would appreciate it. Thanks. ",

When we have a question we create a post for it on our website, then link to christian and secular responses to that question (if there are any). I'm trying to find out if this is even a legitimate question to ask, I should have been more clear originally, as it seems to have led to some confusion.\n\n",

        "text": "I am interested in discussing your thoughts about the existence of, or lack thereof, **the soul**.\n\nThe concept of the soul is *everywhere*. I can't escape it, and it's bothering me. The way I see religions and faith, I cannot get past the very first principle: **substance dualism**.\n\n*Generally, my question is how does one intellectually get past and validate their belief in substance dualism, that there is a part of a person that is not physical?*\n\nIf it exists, **what is the soul**? I know, maybe that question is for r/philosophy. But I see this question as the fundamental weakness of most religion, *and I cannot get past it to any other conversation about a religion.*\n\n* **What is a soul? Does it have rational ground?**\n* **Why is modern science rejecting dualism?**\n* **Why do people assume that souls exist?**\n* **Will this become a mainstream conversation?**\n\n---\nCONSIDER THESE RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVES\n\n---\n\n&gt; It is a frequent criticism of substance dualism that dualists cannot say what souls are... Souls are immaterial subjects of mental properties. They have sensations and thoughts, desires and beliefs, and perform intentional actions. Souls are essential parts of human beings\" - Christian Philosopher Richard Swinburne\n\nSwinburne is a Philosopher of Religion at Oxford. What evidence does he have for making statements like this?\n\n&gt; Every spiritual soul is created immediately by God (it is not \"produced\" by the parents) and it is immortal: It does not perish when it separates from the body at death. - Catholic.org\n\nThe Catholic Church describes the soul as neither a physical entity nor a consequence of anything physical, but they only use religious text to support these concepts.\n\n&gt; Without the soul, the body is like a light bulb without electricity, a computer without the software, a space suit with no astronaut inside - Jewish Site Chabad.org\n\nIt sounds great, but electricity &amp; software are well-established physical entities. Isn't this analogy just disingenuous about the nature of the soul?\n\n&gt; You don't need scientific proof of the soul, neither do you need blind faith. You know it to exist just as you know your own existence. You can choose to ignore it, or to remember it constantly - Rabbi Aron Moss\n\nWhat am I to make out of this statement? This Rabbi says you 'just know' the soul exists. How does that work, eh?\n\n---\nCONSIDER THESE 'SECULAR' PERSPECTIVES\n\n---\nModern science and philosophy tends to embrace physicalism as an ontological assumption of thought. Is this a deviation from open-mindedness or a proper assumption to make?\n\n&gt; Not only is new physics required [for a soul to exist], but dramatically new physics. Within QFT, there can’t be a new collection of \"spirit particles\" and \"spirit forces\" that interact with our regular atoms, because we would have detected them in existing experiments. - Sean Carroll, Physicist\n\nI am unclear if this is the collective perspective of physicists, but it appears that it is extremely unlikely for physics to allow for a soul to exist and interact with the physical world, no?\n\n&gt; Most people are dualists. Intuitively, we think of ourselves not as physical devices, but as immaterial minds or souls housed in physical bodies. Most experimental psychologists and neuroscientists disagree, at least officially. The modern science of mind proceeds on the assumption that the mind is simply what the brain does. We don’t talk much about this, however. We scientists take the mind’s physical basis for granted. Among the general public, it’s a touchy subject. - Joshua Greene, Harvard Psychologist\n\nIs psychology and neuroscience in collective disagreement, as he states? Is the physicalism taken for granted, and is it done properly and reasonably?\n\n&gt; In the case of the soul, if there is a public controversy over its existence at all, it has been a pretty quiet one, at least compared to the battles raging over evolution. Nevertheless, while a substantial majority of the American public believes in the soul and its survival after death, mainstream science has abandoned this traditional idea\"- Julien Musolino, Cognitive Scientist\n\nAnother statement of the rejection of dualism. Will questioning the concept of the soul become more prevalent in Western society, as it is in scientific domains?\n\n&gt; Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. - Lawrence Krauss\n\nWhy do people feel the need to embrace the concept of a soul so quickly? Is it intuitive and reasonable, or a misunderstanding?\n\n---\n\nIt is also worth noting that brain imaging evidence suggests that all processes of a human being map to brain function; though we \"cannot determine if the neural activity is either necessary and sufficient for such processes\" (Wikipedia).\n\nThe idea of the soul covers moral, scientific, philosophical, cultural, and religious territories. I hope it becomes a more prominent conversation and debate in the decades to come on all such territories.\n\n---\n**TL;DR**: Why should I believe the first proposition of most religious systems, that the soul exists (and a 'supernatural' existence) that is distinct from yet integrated with the body? Known as substance dualism, is there any evidence or rational approach to the concept of a soul?",

My mother-in-law is a practicing Catholic who knows I'm an atheist, knows her daughter, my wife, is slowly becoming one, and is mostly alright with it. However, from time to time she'll include me on emails she sends to her other children and in-laws with religious articles and the like. The latest was this one, about the \"grittiness of the Christian Faith\":\n\nhttp://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/11/the-grittiness-of-christian-faith\n\nIt's harmless, yes, but maybe a little passive aggressive.

How do we know these things actually happened? Are the sources reliable? Obviously the synoptic gospels have different versions of the story. \n\n\"Real things happened to real people at real places in real time.\" Is it enough for me to ask, What are the sources for these? Are they reliable? Can anyone guide me in the right direction?\n\nIs the \"proof\" of the resurrection really proof at all?\n(2nd paragraph in the link). \n\nI suppose I could just respond by asking how you can claim to know these things, and if the sources are reliable....but I'd love to include more. I just don't feel like I'm capable of that on my own. \n\nI guess when I see quotes like this, taken from the article, I have to finally say something: \"...the hard, tangible fact of the redemption; the emblem of Christianity's utter groundedness in reality.\" \n\nThanks for taking the time to read.

        "text": "I made a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3rqfrw/the_mormon_church_now_forbids_children_of_gay/) about the LDS Church banning the children of gay couples from membership.\n\n[This image](http://4c9aaie8nf22wxdk63a2acfl6q.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/11/11.5.15-LDS-policy-same-sex.png) is the text of the leaked handbook change. TL;DR - children who now or have ever resided in a home with same-sex parents may not join the LDS church until they are 18, physically move out, and denounce their parents' marriage.\n\n[The LDS Church has since clarified](https://www.lds.org/pages/church-handbook-changes?lang=eng) that this only applies to children whose primary residence was in a home with same-sex parents.\n\nThis sounds like a slight softening of the policy, but it actually makes it worse. It raises the stakes in divorce cases of mixed-orientation couples. That is to say, if a gay person was faking being straight and married someone of the opposite sex, and then later divorced, the straight parent must fight harder to obtain primary custody to ensure that the child may be baptized Mormon. The gay parent must fight harder to get primary custody to avoid their child being raised to view them as evil and later denouncing them.\n\n-----\n\nThe response to this was a mass resignation event. The resignation process from the LDS church has streamlined since they were sued decades ago for not allowing people to quit, but it can still be tedious if you don't use the correct wording in your resignation letter.\n\nA Utah lawyer volunteered to perform advocate work gratis for anyone resigning from the LDS church. [He has since submitted 2,500+ resignations](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/3t3e5n/i_just_dropped_1830_resignation_letters_in_the/) on behalf of Mormons of varying faith levels.\n\nI say \"varying faith levels\" for a reason. Most of the participants at the Event had already mentally left Mormonism, but were still on membership records. They had stopped attending and paying tithing. The church isn't losing anything with this part of the demographic.\n\nBut there was one example of a guy there -- he was in a suit, and was a local priesthood leader, and the new policy was just too much for him. This is a guy who is assigned over the instruction of the men on Sundays, among other duties. He said that his church congregation will be VERY surprised to not see him there the next day (Sunday).\n\nSeveral speakers presented at the Event, and about half of them were gay people with children. The church's policy when they were younger was to just marry the opposite sex, and God would bless them to be straight for their obedience. They managed to slug through a decade or two, but in the end divorced with kids.\n\nThey were there now because, even after mentally quitting the church and leaving it alone, the church had come back and labeled them with the worst name in its arsenal - Apostates.\n\n-----\n\nThe overall crowd was very friendly, very calm, very orderly. The Event started on the opposite side of the corner of Mormon HQ - the Church Office Building. They walked down the street to a mailbox -- which they completely overflowed and had to use another method for mailing -- and then back to the park. The speakers finished up, and then the group marched past the front of the Church Office Building, LDS Conference Center, Salt Lake City Temple, and around the entire block. Cars honked at us and waved in support. You would NOT BELIEVE how many people were cheering and throwing peace signs and thumbs up.\n\nThe average age at the event had to be at least 40. There were many young adults, and a ton of elderly folks. I was very surprised at this -- it wasn't just a college hipster protest. It was real people, real issues, real pain, and real redemption in the end.\n\n-----\n\nThe ONLY difference between the Mormon church and Westboro Baptist is that Mormons don't use the Other-F-Word.\n\nI have more respect for Westboro Baptist because they have the moral integrity to tell you what they think, right to your face.\n\nMormons instead use marketing research and funnel efforts and money through front organizations, [like how they used the Catholic Church as a pawn in Hawaii in 1997, the same time when they started formulating for their future actions in California.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/3/651188/-)\n\nWestboro flat out tells you that God hates homosexuals. You know it was them, you see their face, you hear their voice. You put the action with the individual. It's a hateful action, but they own it entirely.\n\nMormonism sets up LLCs and lobbying groups, [while writing internal memos and action items on how to best approach a legal strategem in courts by pretending that they are concerned over public safety and not just pushing a religious agenda.](http://imgur.com/a/zRqAP)\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how ashamed I am for ever having participated in such a devastatingly awful machine. I was a missionary for chrissakes.\n",

I put that in my pocket and let it slide.  Later in the conversation I said something to the effect of:\n\n \"You have told me I am closed minded.  I'll tell you right now, that if sufficient evidence were provided, I would change my mind and believe in an all-powerful creator of the universe.  Is there any evidence, or lack thereof, which would cause you to change your mind about His existence?\"  \n\nAs you can probably imagine, the answer was: \"No\"   I think this interchange successfully reverses the \"closed minded\" argument back on the Christian as they are effectively admitting to being completely non receptive to any evidence contrary to their point of view.

Anyway, while discussing the recent terror attacks we came to discuss a number of studies by various government agencies, primarily CIA, that suggest that terror attacks would have far fewer deaths if the victims accepted death as their fate and fought back instead of simply doing what the terrorists said and waiting to die. (I'm terrible at formatting so sorry for a lack of links) To clarify, they show that significantly less harm is done if the victims did literally anything in their own defense rather than lying on the ground hoping to be spared. \n\nMy father made the claim that \"sure, that seems obvious, but in the moment the only people that would do that are trained military operatives or christian heroes because we know where we're going when we die; atheists wouldn't do that\". He knows I no longer hold the beliefs he raised me in so the last bit was a clear attempt at a subtle stab that I avoided pointing out. The conversation basically ended there because I didn't want to make the (obvious to us) point that the terrorists also believed they knew where they were going when they died and that very well could have led to the attacks. Past discussions about the validity of faith claims with him have shown to be completely pointless, but I'm wondering if there is any other way to respond to the essential claim that atheists wouldn't be willing to sacrifice themselves for others because they're all afraid of death? I have some of my own opinions but I'm curious to hear yours. Thanks. ",

        "text": "I often like to play devil's advocate to whomever will discuss religion with me when I don't know which side of an argument to take. It helps me figure out where I stand. However, I have come to indecision regarding what to think about the new atheist argument concerning religiously inspired terrorist attacks. \n\nFrom what I understand, the new atheist argument goes something like this: *Terrorist attacks, such as the recent attack in Paris, are due to religious extremism. However, so long as religion exists at all, there will forever be room for such extremism. Without religion, there will be much less justified bigotry, fewer attacks, less fear and phobia, and more general peace in the world. Therefore, atheists need to get organized and spread their message the same way that any other organized religion spreads its message. It is time to rid the world of the religious tree because it has born one bad apple.*\n\nThe other side of the coin is a little harder for me to paint. I don't quite understand it because all of my atheist friends take the new atheist side and present this side with bias and less detail. If I'm not mistaken, the argument has something to do with taking the moral high ground. \n\nCan someone explain both sides? This topic has given me the most trouble determining where I stand. I can see that the existence of religion allows for extremism, but I also feel that new atheism is often crass, belittling, just as intolerant as the religious they speak ill of, and plain rude at times. I see myself leaning towards the new atheist side, but I want someone to explain what is wrong with it so I either change my mind or can try to find a middle ground. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNew Atheism: Religion breeds extremism and violence. \n\nNon-New Atheism: An intolerant atheist is no better than an intolerant religion-X follower. \n\n**Should atheists organize, in any fashion, to attempt to extinguish religious thought, or should atheists sit back and have faith that the world will sort itself out on it's own without destroying itself in the process?**\n\n**EDIT 1**\n*New Atheism* may be a term devised by religious people to place a broad and negative stereotype over atheists, but whether it is an organized following or not, I'm using the term because it does get my point across in fewer words. \n\n**EDIT 2**\nI've seen a few people saying that religion is not the breeding ground for extremism and violence; oppression breeds extremism and violence. Let's rephrase that: Religion breeds extremism and violence in the form of mass murder, inducing panic/fear on greater scales than anything besides war. \n\n**EDIT 3**\nI'm seeing some people getting angry rather quickly. This was posted to have a conversation based on understanding, not emotions. Please respect me and any commentors in here. This is a common problem atheists need to avoid when talking to *anyone* about faith. \n\n",

He is perhaps best noted for his popular books on evolutionary biology including \"The Selfish Gene\" and, more recently, his critiques of religion.\n\nJohn Maynard Smith began his career as an aeronautical engineer in WW2, and later earned a doctorate in genetics at University College London under J.B.S Haldane.

He was Professor of pharmacology at the University of Illinois Medical Center but spent much of his later life in Switzerland.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this debate is that, for many years, Dawkins has refused to debate creationists.

        "text": "This is about a man who went from atheism to Baptism in his adulthood. I'm going to point out key points in his conversion that probably generalize to many other cases. My main goal here is understanding. I definitely don't want to mock anyone.\n\n## Some background (you can skip this)\n\nI was motivated to do this by recent religiously motivated terrorism, but I will be very careful in drawing any conclusions about this. We all know that groups like ISIS advertise themselves with the promise of adventure and power. But religion definitely also plays a role. You don't become a suicide bomber on peer pressure alone. You also need some belief that Allah will reward you for this or at least a belief that non-muslims deserve to die, for whatever reason.\n\nA few days ago I read the Wikipedia article on [Jihadi John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadi_John) (because I had no idea who the media was suddenly talking about). I think his path to ISIS is fairly typical:\n\n* Child of immigrants to the UK\n* Parents are moderate Muslims\n* Grows up pretty secular\n* Has a good education (Bachelor of Science in Information Systems)\n* Got a good job at an IT company\n* At the age of 25 he joins ISIS.\n\nStudies have shown that terrorists generally have an above-average education (and are often engineers). So why do they fall for radical Islam? To understand this, I was wishing for a first-person account of a conversion to this belief system. There are some articles in big newspapers that try something like that, but the account there isn't very raw.\n\nSo, I found the next best thing; a conversion story to Baptism! Obviously, Baptism should not be compared to terrorism. Baptists are generally very peaceful and they support strict separation of state and church. Also, they're friendly and helpful. Nevertheless, they have some crazy beliefs that clearly have nothing to do with reality.\n\n## The actual story\n\nThe story can be found here:\n\n**[From Roman Catholicism... through atheism... to Christ](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/ti/kreitz/Christian/testimony-online.html)**\n\nYou should read it now; it's not very long. In the following, I'll quote some of the key passages. For those who really don't want to read it, here is a short summary:\n\n* grows up Catholic\n* loses faith as a teenager\n* is lonely, becomes depressed, attempts suicide\n* gets engaged to a Christian, she breaks the engagement because he doesn't believe\n* has some weird experiences, crisis continues\n* gets drawn into a Christian group\n* gradually accepts Jesus as his savior\n\nThe first thing to note is that this is a really smart person. He is a professor of theoretical computer science. And a good one as far as I can tell.\n\n(You might have noticed some parallels to Jihadi John now.)\n\nThe phenomenon that seemingly intelligent people suddenly hold the craziest beliefs, is unfortunately not new. Here is [a quote](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) that compares the search for the truth about the universe with a grail quest:\n\n&gt; the thing about grail quests is – if you make a wrong turn two blocks away from your house, you end up at the corner store feeling mildly embarrassed. If you do almost everything right and then miss the very last turn, you end up being eaten by the legendary Black Beast of Aaargh whose ichorous stomach acid erodes your very soul into gibbering fragments\n\nAs a student of computer science he was able to question some assumptions that other people don't even notice and he really got quite close to the grail (he already called himself an atheist, but as an atheist myself I can tell that he still missed something), but then he took a wrong turn and was doomed. A few subtle mistakes and he was lost.\n\n(The first years of his life are very similar to mine. For this reason I sympathize with this whole story. Had I not found the atheist internet community, this might have happened to me as well.)\n\nNow to my analysis of his conversion. It is all starting to go wrong here:\n\n&gt; I had lots of these questions but an answer to them I could not find. The amusement which most people considered to be satisfying looked empty to me. Neither could work, success, or career give me the fulfillment for which I was looking. Being extraordinarily successful in my studies I had already experienced that. Relating to friends, which I had enough, I found, would not do it either. \n\nThis is already very alarming. First of all, I think he is committing something like the Typical Mind Fallacy (the mistake of assuming that other people are more like you than they actually are). He sees that people have fun while, I don't know, playing soccer or something, but he himself doesn't enjoy that. But instead of looking for activities that he *does* enjoy, he concludes that nothing ever can be enjoyable.  Instead of treating this as an object level problem, he turns it into a philosophical problem.\n\nFurthermore, he says, he has friends, he just doesn't like relating to them. Again, the solution is to find other friends. I know this is hard and many people feel lonely and are desperate, but turning it into a philosophical problem doesn't help! After his conversion he has lots of friends and he seems happy; so clearly it *is* possible to enjoy having friends.\n\n&gt; Finally I came to the conclusion that life must be meaningless. A terrible thought: everything is absolutely meaningless.\n\nThis is of course the dissatisfaction speaking. It is a conclusion that a mind not used to confusing questions is likely to arrive at (I don't want so sound mean here, but it's usually teenager who say something like this).\n\nAnother serious mistake is debating only with Christians (getting all his information from one source). I dare say if he had read a book by Dawkins when he was still an atheist, none of the rest would have happened. At least he should have looked into other religions like Buddhism.\n\nAfter a second suicide attempt he meets a girl and falls in love. He doesn't say it, but I guess he doesn't consider life quite so meaningless with her. However, she breaks the engagement and his crisis starts in full. He has this weird experience with being possessed. I don't really know what to think about that. Only that I've heard of weirder things.\n\nThe rest of the story is basically a lesson in how to manipulate people. Attending a Christian conference in his vulnerable state has the expected consequence. First, they make him feel even more miserable, then they promise absolution for everything.\n\nThe part about the sins is also interesting in another way:\n\n&gt; But, although I tried to refuse the offer, immediately an incredible list of sins I had committed appeared before me. No, I was by no means the righteous man I always believed myself to be. There were so many sinful actions where I had made up excuses for in order to feel justified. But there was no excuse for what I had done and I could not get away from the guilt that remained.\n\nThis is before his conversion and it clearly shows his lingering Catholic education. He still has internalized the concept of sin. What he seems to be totally lacking is compassion for himself. This compassion was probably destroyed in his isolated phase with the suicide attempts.\n\n(The concept of sin seems to be all about forgiving yourself. Usually, if you acted destructively somewhere, you try to fix it and apologize to the people involved. Confessing it doesn't solve any problems except your bad conscience.)\n\nHe is then coerced into confessing his sins and committing his life to Jesus.\n\n&gt; But the whole step did not feel right.\n\nHe does it because it seems to be expected of him. Making people feel that way is a really powerful way of manipulating them. For the manipulation to work, it is important that they think it was their decision. There is research that shows that humans tend to try to have continuity in their identity. If we do something once, we consider it part of our identity and are more likely to do it again.\n\nAlthough it hadn't felt right, he still joins this Christian group (probably because he likes being around them). And from this point on, he takes Christianity serious. He seriously talks to someone about still being bound to Satan. Contrast this to his earlier attitude:\n\n&gt; \"Of course, I would follow Jesus immediately if he really existed\", I thought\n\nTo him, achieving happiness is now equivalent to becoming more Christian. He finally has a nice religious experience:\n\n&gt; Finally he said to me: \"By the power of Jesus Christ you are free from these bindings from now on until eternity.\" Immediately after that the heavy burdens that had been on me were gone never to return again.\n\nIt's hard not to feel happy for him here. He really has had a rough time and his life has just improved dramatically. He interacts with helpful and friendly people (a basic human need) and he has the feeling that someone is watching over him. To him, converting to Christianity is only associated with good things. Another quirk in humans: confusing correlation with causation.\n\nHe is happy with his faith; but it is of course all wrong. He won't go to heaven when he dies. Praying won't end all the problems in the world. Living in an open relationship that makes all participants happy doesn't damn you to hell. Trusting in God won't protect us from asteroids that hurl through space. The bible won't help you either because it was written by a desert people a few thousand years ago who didn't know the first thing about this universe.\n\nAnd this all could have been avoided if we went to one of those [cuddle parties](http://www.cuddleparty.com/).\n\n-----\n\nWhat I especially appreciate about his account of the conversion process is his honesty. And I also think there is a lot to learn from this. For example that conversion is a slow process. And that lacking only a few mental defenses can already doom you. And, well, that we should have some sympathy for converts.",

My professor, admittedly agrees with a lot of the points made by Harris, Dawkins, Hitch, etc, but still dislikes there writings. Basically he feels they paint with too broad of a brush based on very specific and targetted selections from the holy books. \n\nAn example my professor gave: Harris writes that Islam supports suicide bombs, and gives specific quotes from the Hadith and the Koran that support his claim. To the reader, who is not super familiar with Islam (me), this seems like game over, the quotes are there and Harris must be right. However, Harris does not quote the parts of the Quran and the Hadith that don't support his argument. Basically, Harris, like many religious people, ignores how many nuances and contradictions there are in the Holy books.\n\n\nI think the lesson learned for me is that while I enjoy the books written by Harris, Hitchens, and Dawkins, it is never as black and white as they may make it out to be. Just like everything in life... \n\nTLDR: Have any of you discovered legitimate criticisms of the \"New Atheist\" writers? ",

Bigotry towards Muslims doesn't affect me one bit. But I care about them because they are human beings. I didn't ignore what you said. I just said what you said is completely unhelpful in moving dialogue forward and helping these people change the religion they grew up on. It's dishonest to say Islam has nothing to do with what ISIS and other groups want to accomplish. Islam has SOMETHING to do with it. But yes blaming 1.2 billion people for Paris is stupid and counter productive. And you should care what liberal Muslims have to say as you seemingly share their values. How you can dismiss their thoughts on their own religion is beyond me. They are the ones that want to help and stop the cycle of violence.

I didn't even respond disagreeing with what you said. Apologist is the wrong word to use, but it is incorrect to say Islam (an idea) does not inspire some nut cases to do what they do.

White, Muslim, Christian, black, males, females, gay, straight. \n\nIslam ain't got shit to do with that.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**My Reply:**\n\nNow you're trying to pigeonhole me into a box, saying I'm incapable of understanding your position because I'm white. What's going on here?  \n\nYou don't think Islam is a race, do you? It's an system of ideas that any one person can obey or reject. There are millions of white blue eyed and blonde hair Bosnian, Albanian, and Chechyan Muslims out there for example. I attacked your idea. What I said isn't even an original idea, it's from ex Muslims. Where does whiteness fit into their argument? It feels like you're putting your fingers in your ears and closing your eyes through this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Original Poster Reply:**\n\nI'm saying you have no idea what it means to be marginalized because you are a straight white guy. You are clueless to any real, substantial marginalization. Just clueless. \n\nThus, you are unable to see the comparisons of how killers who may be Muslims get treated vs killers who are white get treated. \n\nYou say those Muslims culture makes them killers, I say those white boys culture made them killers. \n\nThe culture surrounding their whiteness. I mean c'mon, the vast majority of innocent baby killers in America are white males, shouldn't we examine these white males closer? Hold their culture accountable? \n\nLet's put white culture on trial for the transgressions of a few of their own. \n\nNo? You don't want to do that, right? \nSo why do it to someone else?\n\n1.57 billion Muslims in the world. A couple of deranged fuck faces in a sea of 1.57 billion. But hey, Islam is the problem, immigrants are the problem. \n\nNothing but racism, bigotry and xenophobia.\n\nThere are probably what, 100 million white males in America. Probably a higher ratio of white male baby killers to white males than there are Muslim terrorists to all Muslims.\n\nThinking these psychos are terrorists because they are Muslim is like thinking kids in Chicago kill each other because that's what blacks do. \n\nIt's an easy, stupid surface, over simplification to a very complex problem involving lower class struggles and anger at a lack of access more than anything else. But no one wants to look at the why. \n\nIt's much easier to simplify. Unless it's little Bobby shooting up the school. Then and only then can we try and understand underlying motivation. And that's bullshit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Friend of Original Poster:**\n\n@[to me] the text of the Quran has remained the same over the years. The point I think you are trying to make is undermined by a number of assumptions. A consistent thread in your tone is this idea that the religion itself has to change. Again to [original poster's] point... The Catholic church systematically abuses, rapes children across the globe. They architect sophisticated solutions to hide and deceive any and everyone that might be concerned about their disgusting behavior that has likely been going on for longer than we know. Yet somehow the idea that Catholicism is inherently the problem and source of this vile behavior is never really placed on the table. There is no \"we've got to help change the Catholicism these people grew up in\". Oh and the idea that some sick bastard can cite some chapter and verse as the basis of what they do doesn't mean much. Extremists and nut jobs of all religions have been doing that very thing forever. Charles Manson read from the bible and used it as a basis for his evil. There are far more complex sociopolitical and cultural forces at play. Additionally if the balance of power among nations with respect to religions were different I'd argue we'd likely be having a similar convo about Christian extremists blowing shit up. The G7 nations ain't muslim nations. Look at what happens in Ireland. The side with less power resorts to extremism and infuses their belief system to bind and motivate people because that's what all religions do. So to focus on the religion is missing the mark entirely. Christianity was and is still used to justify slavery and the abuse and murder of human beings. The KKK narrative was rooted in Christianity. They literally burned crosses. Again somehow the entire religion of Christianity is never indicted despite it being used to \"bless\" global atrocities time and time again. All of these things are much more complex and deeply nuanced then \"oh we've gotta help them change their religion\".",
