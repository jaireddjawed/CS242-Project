        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10uy8hv/a_brief_report_on_the_learning_experience_that/",
        "text": "Taking inspiration from a similar post from about a year ago by the well-known xanthic\\_strath (and for longer than I care to remember I’ve secretly been following his posts to continue absorbing more information about languages and language learning, since his comments are so often insightful), I wanted to share my own experience with arriving at the C2 level in Spanish according to the very same ACTFL Writing Proficiency Test that he reported on not so long ago. It goes without saying that, on this proficiency test, I scored in the “superior” category, which is equivalent to C2 in the CEFR (as indicated [in this paper](https://www.actfl.org/uploads/files/general/Assigning_CEFR_Ratings_To_ACTFL_Assessments.pdf)). \n\nIt was, for me, an interesting experience undergirded by a very long process of studying and learning, and I have to admit that even this phase of my learning lasted a very long time and was preceded by 1.5 years or so of living in Madrid, Spain, where I was teaching English. With that said, I don’t think my writing success owes as much to that experience as to two other elements that have been far more important: \n\n· Consistency\n\n· A variety of methods\n\nNow I’ll break these methods down to give you an idea of my preparation and learning process during the year before I took the exam: \n\n**Consistency**: Between my return from Spain and the date of this ACTFL exam, there was about one year during which I devised a method of importing articles from *El País* into a text reader called Voice Dream Reader. This has a variety of accents and adjustable speed, and after switching the accent to the male Castilian version, I started importing and reading something like 5-10 newspaper articles a day, gradually bumping up the speed until I was clocking about 350-400 words per minute. For my comfort with the complexity of the texts and my speed of comprehension, I always used English as a point of comparison, since this is my native language and the one in which (ostensibly) I have the highest degree of comfort. My goal was to get so good at reading Spanish articles and essays of moderate complexity that it would be, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from my comfort level with English texts of the same complexity and speed. \n\nI did this pretty much every day, almost developing something of a monomania for the activity itself (I can be a bit obsessive) because the process of reading and listening at the same time became a hypnotic, sometimes euphoric activity. And after 1,000+ newspaper articles, I can say that I’ve acquired an extremely high degree of comfort with the styles and conventions of Spanish in this journalistic mode, and now it’s starting to rival my English levels of comfort, speed, and lexical familiarity. \n\n**Variety**: In addition to this method, I read plenty of books and a quarterly literary magazine (called *El Ciervo*, from Barcelona--totally recommend it), and listened to a huge variety of podcasts and audio books. My favorite application for these latter has been Storytel, which has a range of Spanish audio books for a small monthly subscription fee. Lastly, my speed-reading activities helped me enhance my listening skills for more formal content, such as the news and documentaries, where I regularly speeded up the audio to 1.5-2 times the normal speed to make it more difficult (and also more efficient). \n\nIn terms of other skills, my speaking still has a bit of catching-up to do, but I’m confident that my reading and general literacy has a substantial foundation that I’ll just continue to build on and refine in the years to come. \n\nI hope this was somewhat helpful, and I apologize for the length. I’m not always longwinded, I promise.",

I'm quite good at vocab, grammar and stuff. I'm even good at pronouncing foreign words.\n\nBut when it was my time to speak, the cat got my tongue. Nothing came out. The convos usually stopped at hello.\n\nOn the flip side, I also discovered that most introverts are highly analytical, and I should leverage this strength to become a confident polyglot.\n\nUsing my analytical skills,  I discovered for communications in a foreign language to be successful, **the learning must be highly situational.** Everything must be learned according to topics, not grammar or drills.\n\nLittle by little, I developed a roadmap that has successfully cured me of the cat-got-my-tongue syndrome in foreign languages.\n\nEven though I still get butterflies before I speak, but I've now become more sure of what to say, and what to anticipate to be asked in return: two things crucial to make a conversation flow.\n\nThis highly topical and situational approach has helped me use my target language as a tool for communication and connection. Something many introverts secretly want, but don't know how to get it.\n\nBTW, this is [how I sound now in a variety of languages](https://twitter.com/T_L_Guy/status/1569690974787346433?s=20&amp;t=ub8JLfgrE0XFGUXyGypHoA).

Since you're an introvert, I guess you might feel a bit uncomfortable to tell me you're interested in the comment. \n\nIf so, you can DM me or email me at TLG@thatlanguageguy.com to tell me whether you're interested, or ask me any related questions.\n\nI'll do what I can to help you clarify things.",

So I basically ordered fully in Spanish to the one guy and when I went to pay, I had a full on conversation in French with the other.\n\nIt was a REALLY insane experience using both languages almost simultaneously with them and oh my god I mixed up the languages so much. I've forgotten lots of French obviously though as I haven't touched it since I've been in Spain for almost 3 weeks now and have wanted to focus on Spanish.

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some advice on how to approach my language learning. I've always wanted to become really good at speaking Italian &amp; Spanish and I'm finally able to dedicate a good chunk of time to pursuing this goal. I speak fluent English &amp; German, but I don't know any Romance languages fluently.\n\n\nQuick background:\n\nIn the past, when I had time, I've always sort of switched studying between the two depending on which one I was motivated to learn more at the time. Then I'd get busy in life and there would be a pause in the studying, only for me to pick it up again a long while later. This constant on/off and switching between the two has just left me at an upper A1 level in both. \n\nWhy I want to learn Spanish:\n\n- I've noticed that Spanish comes more natural/quick to me due to having studied it throughout high school. \n- Early next year, I'm planning a long trip across Mexico, so it'd be great to better my spanish for that. \n\nWhy I want to learn Italian:\n\n- I live very near Italy, so I am in the country pretty often. \n- Have Italian family members\n\nTLDR:\n\nSo, to summarize, is it smarter for me to learn Spanish to a decent level first and then Italian due to it coming a bit more natural to me?\n\nOr should I attempt to study both simultaneously? (I don't mix them up too much so far)\n\nThanks!",

It's available in [French](https://freqburger.com/french/), [Japanese](https://freqburger.com/japanese/), [Chinese](https://freqburger.com/chinese/),\n[Spanish](https://freqburger.com/spanish/), [German](https://freqburger.com/german/), and [Italian](https://freqburger.com/italian/) (for now).\n\nI always like to learn words in context. Tools like [linguee](https://www.linguee.com/) and [reverso](https://www.reverso.net) are great for this, but I've always wanted a few tweaks:\n\n* An emphasis on **word frequency**. The top words account for a huge percentage of usage (in fact, the top 1,000 words often make up 75% or more of all speech), so it's very helpful to prioritize the most common words. By seeking out sentences with more commonly used words on average, we can also maximize our likelihood of finding [comprehensible input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis).\n* More information about **words used together**. There are a lot of words used in predictable patterns. These common patterns often help you internalize both grammar and vocabulary. What I always wanted was a diagram of the most common words used with a word I'm learning, along with listings of the most common groups of various lengths, and an easy way to get example sentences with each group. There was a good post on [the Spanish subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/qq5vii/this_is_why_you_still_cant_understand_spanish/) awhile back talking about this idea, too.\n* [**Register**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) as a useful way of segmenting word frequency. It's critical to note that a word might be very common in some contexts and less common in others. It matters a lot to me that a word is more common in Wikipedia articles than in TV shows, for example, so I want to know how it ranks in both datasets.\n* Ease of use. I want to just click on a word, and go straight to more information about it. I want to be able to quickly get sentences into my anki decks. I really don't want a bunch of ads cluttering things, either.\n\nSo, I took those ideas and made my own prototype site, just for fun. \n\nIt uses Sankey diagrams (like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mreichhoff/FreqBurger/main/sankey-sample.png)) to show how words flow together; it sorts its examples by word frequency, separated by dataset; it lists out common [collocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation); it has graphs to understand how much of a language you know by learning the top words; you can make flashcards easily and export them to Anki; you can listen to the sentences with browser text-to-speech; and you can move around with ease.\n\nAs mentioned, it's free, with no ads or any tracking garbage, and the code is all open source (check it out [on GitHub](https://github.com/mreichhoff/freqburger)).\n\nLet me know of any feedback!",

        "text": "Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post but here goes. I am a mom to a 1 years old baby girl. I’m from Finland, born to a Finnish father and a Pakistani mother so I’m a native speaker of both Finnish and Urdu. My husband is from Poland, native Polish speaker. I don’t speak Polish and he doesn’t speak Finnish or Urdu, so we speak English to one another. We now live Switzerland in a relatively bilingual (German/French city) and love it here, we have no plans to leave and want to integrate as best as possible by sending our child to a bilingual German/French school program beginning hopefully when she’s around 3. Our plan was as followed:\n\n• I will speak and teach her Finnish;\n\n• My mom (who lives nearby and will watch my daughter when I return to work) will speak and teach her Urdu;\n\n• My husband will speak and teach her Polish;\n\n• We will speak English as a family and expect her to speak English as our common language together;\n\n• She will pick up German/French at school (these are community languages, so shouldn’t be too hard to do).\n\nWe discussed this plan with our doctor at her 1 year checkup and he basically lost it saying we were basically crazy for wanting to raise her in 6 languages. But it’s not like any of these are random choices. What do you think? Will 6 confuse her, is it too many?",

        "text": "We are all familiar with the FSI levels that categorize the languages by difficulty for English monoglots. And by \"difficulty\" they primarily mean how long it takes people to become fluent. Since the FSI has a lot of experience with standardized language education, I assume that those categories are pretty accurate.   \n\nHowever the categories I-V themselves are pretty broad and it is unclear how the languages rank within those levels. For example, both Greek and Hebrew are Category IV languages. Yet the difference between Category IV and Category V is 1000 hours. So there is a lot of leeway in between.  \n\nAnother measure of language difficulty is how closely a language is related to English. However, the proximity score doesn't always accurately reflect the difficulty due to other factors such as script or pronunciation. For example, even though Danish is closely related to English, it is relatively difficult to pronounce. And while Basque is not at all related to English, its pronunciation and script are pretty straightforward.\n\nSo in some cases we may have to adjust the ranking a little bit.\nIn any case, I think a ranking like this may be good topic for discussion.  \nHere we go:\n\n\nRank|Language|FSI|Gen.prox.\n:--:|---|:---:|:---:\n1|Norwegian|I|24.0\n2|Swedish|I|26.7\n3|Dutch|I|27.2\n4|Afrikaans|I|27.5\n5|Italian|I|47.8\n6|Spanish|I|57.0\n7|Portuguese|I|59.8\n8|Danish|I|20.6\n9|Catalan||56.5\n10|French|I|48.7\n11|Romanian|I|54.9\n12|German|II|30.8\n13|Yiddish||37.3\n14|Indonesian|III|87.9\n15|Malaysian|III|\n16|Swahili|III|92.1\n17|Icelandic|IV|36.6\n18|Greek|IV|69.9\n19|Bulgarian|IV|69.8\n20|Serbo-Croation|IV|60.3\n21|Czech|IV|66.9\n22|Russian|IV|60.3\n23|Ukrainian|IV|60.3\n24|Polish|IV|66.9\n25|Albanian|IV|80.4\n26|Latvian|IV|81.4\n27|Irish||75.3\n28|Bengali|IV|68.0\n29|Persian|IV|78.0\n30|Amharic|IV|82.0\n31|Turkish|IV|92.0\n32|Nepali|IV|62.3\n33|Hindi|IV|65.2\n34|Urdu|IV|65.2\n35|Armenian|IV|82.9\n36|Burmese|IV|85.7\n37|Uzbek|IV|86.8\n38|Hebrew|IV|91.1\n39|Khmer|IV|93.8\n40|Tagalog|IV|95.7\n41|Somali||87.7\n42|Lao|IV|95.8\n43|Basque||95.3\n44|Estonian|IV*|84.9\n45|Finnish|IV*|86.9\n46|Georgian|IV*|86.9\n47|Hungarian|IV*|87.9\n48|Chechen||97.2\n49|Thai|IV*|92.9\n50|Mongolian|IV*|92.9\n51|Vietnamese|IV*|96.1\n52|Arabic|V|83.6\n53|Korean|V|90.0\n54|Mandarin|V|82.4\n55|Cantonese|V|90.1\n56|Japanese|V*|88.3",

        "text": "Hello my question is in regards to fluency and specialized knowledge of a language. I am compelled to learn a language, specifically German right now, despite having no practical use case for it. However, many of the philosophers I have read and want to read are German and thus due to my interest in the German language to put it to use I figured I would read philosophy in German probably after about one or two years of learning and reading/listening to much easier content. \n\nNow my question in regards to fluency here is how possible/reasonable is it to have specialized knowledge in two or more languages. First example being philosophy, like if I read those philosophers in German would it be like doing everything twice trying to understand things in English's and in German? \n\nAnother example is as a developer (or any job) there is specific terms and ideas to development, like would it be possible and or reasonable to go back and forth between two or more languages for these topics or would that be more like learning everything twice and not worth it, thus maybe better to keep areas separate like only do your job stuff in x language and only do other interest in y language. \n\nI would like to read and study some philosophy in German and maybe French or other languages in the future but not sure if this is just unreasonable and better to just do in English.\n\nWould appreciate some perspective on how you manage different languages and if you sort of separate specialized knowledge or if fluency entails easily understanding specialized knowledge in multiple languages, Thanks.",

Seen this in some Yoututbers etc who frequently use english.\n\nBut others have an easier time. Same with americans, some have trouble with spanish/Portugues/etc learning , but others speak it well faster.\n\nSo you cannot say that your methods will work on everyone the same way.",

Then I asked it to pretend to be the clerk at a hotel and to help me check in. It took a few tries to get my request across in Spanish (maybe I should have set that up in english. I had to ask it literally \"I want you to act like a hotel employee and check me in\"), but now I'm able to converse in spanish and practice some dialog in a situation-specific context.\n\nThe bot told me where my room was, asked if I needed help with luggage or wanted to make a dinner reservation. I made up some allergies and special meal requests and so on.\n\nI haven't tried to get it to correct my grammar or anything yet, so that's next.\n\nI love the idea of practicing writing, but I'm bad at coming up with prompts outside of writing a daily journal. I also like the idea of practicing specific scenarios to gain some confidence.",

About a month ago I started getting really interesting in other languages, and made a commitment to myself to learn French and Japanese for no particular reason. I am an absolute beginner here, other than the few odd phrases I had zero experience with either language. I've made some progress (mostly with Duolingo) but I was wondering what the best way to get into these languages would be. Is Duolingo helpful for beginners? Is attempting to take two languages on at once a bad idea? More than anything else I am curious how other people here began their learning and maybe could recommend some strategies/ resources or what worked for them. Thanks!",
