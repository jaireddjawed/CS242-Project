        "text": "My wife groaned at the dinner table when the bottle of store brand ketchup replaced the empty name brand one.   She's a huge fan of ketchup and fries, and I've learned that the store brand fries are not as good as the name brand.   Won't make that mistake a 2nd time.   But anyway..\n\nThe store brand is 'organic';  it was priced between the name brand and the non-organic store brand, maybe it's just as good as the name?  What are the odds that someone makes bad organic tomatoes? \n\nTurns out, it's just as good AND.... it uses organic sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup like the name brand stuff.  It's also 25% lower in calories per equivalent serving for some reason.\n\nSaving money and possibly healthier?  Seems like a double win to me.",

        "text": "I found around 15 dead alkaline batteries, some of which are starting to corrode and, for one toy, the battery was fully corroded and rusted out the contacts. I also found half a dozen rechargeable batteries (NiMH) that were dead or low. Those are on the smart charger now and actually show voltage, so that‚Äôs a good sign. \n\nMany of these toys will likely be donated eventually, so getting the alkaline batteries out now likely saved them from the trash. Even if we keep them, I don‚Äôt want that nasty stuff in the kids‚Äô toys. \n\nI also found several button cell toys, one of which is not accessible. These usually come from other kid‚Äôs bday parties, because I refuse to buy these things. That‚Äôs a lot of non-recyclable stuff for a toy (a light in this case) that will have to be tossed if you don‚Äôt want to destroy the toy to repurpose the light itself. Actually, that‚Äôs not a bad idea‚Ä¶\n\nSolution, either:\n\n1. Check the batteries in all of the toys periodically (keeping a list of what has batteries, especially the more valuable rechargeable batteries), or\n\n2. Hoard the batteries in storage and only install batteries in stuff that the kids are actively using. It‚Äôs much easier to track down a few toys than two dozen little ones that gets lost easily. \n\nI do a mix of both. I don‚Äôt swap out the batteries that come with toys, so I just check them periodically. For the NiMH I keep most of those in a drawer. For lanterns and lights, I charge the batteries every so often, just in case. I just checked the lantern in my kids‚Äô room and the light was starting to dim, so they‚Äôll be charged. Either he‚Äôs been using the light or the rechargeables are starting to go.",

Filll with hot water for the beads to dissolve faster and shake it a bunch. If you use cold or room temperature water it seems to take a few days of shaking every once in a while for the beads to fully dissolve and for this to work properly.\n\nAlso a side note on the spray bottle you choose, some of the bottles I've tried don't work well with this thicker liquid and get clogged easy.

Unfortunately it didn't have a full size fridge, just one of those mini dorm fridges with almost no freezer space. It couldn't keep up, so I found myself having to regularly buy bags of ice to store in it.\n\nI had never noticed this before, but Steak and Shake will actually sell you large bags of ice for only 99 cents - at least the one near me does. I also noticed one of my local Burger King's is also selling bags of ice as well but I didn't check on their price for it.\n\nEasy way to save a few bucks if you need some bags of ice for something like a party or gathering.",

It got worse and worse over time and recently became so bad that the alert would just always be on.\n\nI'm not the craftiest, but I try to do whatever repairs on my car when I can. I've changed spark plugs, replaced the bumper on this one, replaced fuses, etc. I had watched a video about the aforementioned problem and was about to disassemble the button assembly (the little rubber nipple that depresses when the door closes and tells the car that it's closed) when I looked at the door itself. The area that makes contact with the nipple had been dented to hell and that's when it hit me. My wife, on several occasions, had closed the door before the seatbelt had completely retracted and that's what caused the dents. Solution? A $0.25 rubber adhesive bumper. I had a pack of like, 15 of them just lying around from some other project. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/70zInLv\n\nI cleaned the area, applied the bumper, closed the door. No more door ajar alert. What would've cost a ton in mechanic and/or body shop fees costs nearly nothing. Needless to say, I'm very pleased with myself.",

I can eat this and what I already have at home for about a month. \n\nThat's 25 pounds of cat litter, for which my cats thank me. \n\nI think my store is getting ready to introduce smaller sizes for salad dressing, which is why the bottles were $1.00 each.  A few weeks ago the same store was getting rid of their house name pasta for 50 cents a pound---for those looking to be frugal, I suggest looking for any clearance items that might be replaced by a smaller or more expensive item. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 2kiifw4dhhda1...*",
