If you've seen any animated adults show since Dara then you know what to expect and it doesn't do anything new with Scooby-Doo either in terms of it's core mystery detective elements (minus Scooby, obviously). I've had some laughs but it's no Seinfeld. I started watching just to see if it is really has bad has it was made out to be, I even read something about the authors making Scooby a girl and having Shaggy have sex with her but that just turned out to be someone's fanfic idea, but it isn't even SJW material and most of the time it gets turned around and the \"progressive speechs\" end up just being a setup for a punchline for the mean girls/the jocks/the teachers to dunk on Velma. \n\nI haven't kept up with Scooby-Doo since the live action movies and in normal conditions this would have probably passed under the radar for me but with all the hate and articles about the hate I just decided to give it a look and now I will finish it (hate starting shows and dropping them) but I don't think I will be back for more unless something truly unexpected happens.",

First of all, Amelia is a very beautiful, smart and competent girl who works for the CIA and we‚Äôre supposed to believe she‚Äôs so starved for attention she has to force her coworkers to sleep with her in return for making them favors? Secondly, who the fuck is this supposed for?

She bought a large Visio TV and put her old TV in her room about 2 months ago.\n\nI love watching movies, and so we have a Blu-ray Player connected to the new Visio TV. (I don't have a TV in my room for a handful of off-topic reasons.)\n\nTo watch TV, we have to put it on the HDMI 1 setting, and to watch a movie, we have to put it on HDMI 2.\n\nEvery now and then, when I watch a movie, my Grandma will later go to watch TV and the cable box on but the TV setting says \"No signal.\" Also, the HDMI 1 setting says DCX- random numbers and letters.\n\nWhen that happens, the cable can turn on, but there's no cable TV. The Blu-ray Player always works fine.\n\nMost of the time, I don't have this problem, but Grandma does. She thinks it's my fault. (I watched a movie on Friday while home alone, put the cable back- it didn't work. Took a shower, and it was fine.)\n\nGrandma has the most problems with it but assumes it's my fault. What is the problem? I've described it the best I can in words.\n\nPS, if you go to HDMI 2, the Blu-ray player automatically turns on, and you have to use the remote to turn it off. She thinks this part of the problem, but if she doesn't hit HDMI 2, that's not an issue.\n\nAny useful tips is appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm curious how good a show could be while having little-to-no emphasis on romantic plots.\n\nIt's one thing to acknowledge that some characters are in a relationship, but it's another to actual spend screen time or plot development on the workings of that relationship. For example, Batman and Superman's parents are married, but those stories almost never focus on those marriages with any sort of development.\n\nAnother way to reduce the emphasis is to have the romantic elements obscured by unreal circumstances. For example, many of the seemingly-romantic connections in Westworld end up including robots, so the point is more to showcase the state of the technology rather than to delve into the nuances of any particular relationship. The few real relationships we see (William's marriage and Caleb's girlfriend) are short-lived and don't get explored much.\n\nSo what examples of decent shows can you think of where exploring romantic connections does not feel like part of the DNA of the show? Something I can watch and get a break from having to think about that kinda stuff?",

        "text": "For those of you who haven‚Äôt seen/heard about it, it‚Äôs an HBO show that originally aired in 2005 with 1 season, and then had a 2nd season in 2014 after it regained popularity online. \n\nThe show stars Lisa Kudrow as actress Valerie Cherish. The premise of the show is simple, but also kinda hard to explain, so bear with me. Valerie starred in a popular sitcom years ago, but hasn‚Äôt had mainstream success since then, but she‚Äôs going up for a role in a new sitcom. This role is written for a woman of a certain age and the front runners are all previous tv stars by design.\n\nBUT within the show, there‚Äôs a reality TV crew producing a show called 'The Comeback' where, if you get the role, you‚Äôre contractually obligated to star in 'The Comeback' as a doc to show how an actress like Val can make a comeback. \n\nHOWEVER, what we see as an audience is literally just the ‚Äúraw footage‚Äù of that fictional reality show. [The most famous clip being her ‚ÄúWell I got it!‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8yyrQUZycM) talking head clip gives a good idea of how this show is, [as well as this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9PtYIB0ks). Like there‚Äôs scenes where she has to wait until the camera person gets a better shot, or redo lines because of technical issues. It really makes you feel like an editor just browsing the dailys. Plus anyone wanting to be an actor NEEDS to watch this. Also no other show will give you as much second hand embarrassment as this because it's all presented as raw footage with no music or anything. \n\nI think in 2005 people weren't quite sure what to make of this, but today I feel like most people would \"get it\". \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "1. The Wire - I understand that this isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion, but I believe that the story telling and character development in this show across seasons is second to none\n\n2. Breaking Bad - An intense story told in a way where common sense was easy to question, but was also easy to follow empathetically at the same time. Acting was probably the best I‚Äôve ever seen in a TV show and the ending somehow didn‚Äôt disappoint to the level that other shows equal in popularity did. \n\n3. Chernobyl - the best TV Miniseries of all time. Perfectly casted. Very well paced. This show is just entertaining as hell and gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.\n\n4. Arrested Development - this spot was insanely hard to decide on, but I could watch AD 1000 times over nonstop and still laugh my ass off. The writing is second to none, the characters are as entertaining as it gets, and most importantly I‚Äôll watch 5 episodes and it‚Äôll seem like I‚Äôve only seen one. This show has made me cry laughing multiple times and I can‚Äôt get enough of it.\n\n5. Parks and Rec - this is probably where the list starts to lose some people (because a genre wasn‚Äôt defined in the listing of best shows.)Parks and Rec, to me, is a staple in comedic TV shows and also sports some impressive and hilarious performances from a cast that has proven they are elite.",

The show benefits from being very well-executed meta piece and also a pretty realistically written sitcom. \n\nI feel many shows tend to lose the audience with ideas like this because writers get too fixated on making the silly parts too silly to create wider exemplification to justify their meta take, which has proven to be far too excessive. This so far is very much \"Get it right\". The sitcom portions feel like a bunch of nerd writers in a room bouncing off each other. Then we cut laugh track and perfectly segue into the protagonist's internal stories away from the glamour that her husband Kevin, who we remember can fuck right off, seems to always be the centre of.\n\nThe message is obvious, but I'll say so far its a very well executed one.",

It's directed by Jason Woliner whose past credits include the last Borat movie but this show somehow takes reality and the film world and mixes them up into something new in a way I think even Sacha Baron Cohen can only dream of.\n\nHas anybody ever made something like this before? The amount of layers and for lack of a better word \"metaness\" to this thing almost makes me sick. I love it. Its weird and funny and cringey and great and I just need more people to experience it.

The opening competition especially is childish, as is the obstacle course. Both parts also are unnecessary and feels out of place. \n\nThe actual making of the play - doh displays are pretty interesting. It‚Äôs similar to competitive cooking shows, where the contestants are preparing something and a judge/host comes to give some advice. \n\nThe advice is given by a play-doh expert/artist with a Mohawk. \n\nWhile there are parts of the show that are off-putting, it also makes me want to keep watching.

The original cast is the sole reason that the original series worked, not because the writing was so exceptional. The writing obviously wasn't bad, but the natural chemistry of the cast is absolutely what made the show so memorable and beloved. The OG cast is in top form in the pilot of that 90's Show, and Topher Grace, in particular, stole the show. Seeing Eric, Donna, Red, and Kitty banter again was amazing soul food. I understand Netflix and the creator's intentions by shifting the focus to the younger cast, but I genuinely think that is a miscalculation on their part. They've hinged too much on attracting a younger audience, when simply recapturing their old audience would have done much better and would've been much less risky. The new cast isn't terrible, but the new characters aren't all that lovable just yet. Maybe in a season or two things will click, but the chemistry of the original cast is one in a million and should be the focus of this new series IMO.",

Kim was also a voice actor on the ATLA animated series &amp; \"The Legend Of Korra, so his involvement with this series gives me some hope.\n\nI think Ken Leung is a great choice for commander Zhao. Anybody familiar with his filmography knows that he's really good at playing an asshole. \n\nWHAT I'M NOT LIKING: \n\nThis is going to sound like a super dorky complaint, but I'm disappointed that they won't be adapting the comics.   After ATLA ended, the creators continued the narrative through a series of canonical graphic novels.  They answered crucial questions that were left unanswered in the animated series. \n\nThere are times when I question why ATLA needs to be adapted in the first place. One of the reasons why is because the kid actors are going to age out of their roles before the series is over--especially the kid playing Aang.  \n\nI'm disappointed that the creators are not going to be involved with the show. When they live action series was announced,  ATLA creators Bryan Konietzko &amp; Michael Di Martino were going to be the showrunners of the animated series, but they left due to creative differences with Netflix. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your expectations for this show?",

However when I try and show somebody a show I like or have something on in the background there have been comments in the past from men that a show is too girly or too light and that‚Äôs fair enough, people have preferences and some men don‚Äôt want to watch shows like that. \n\nMy last boyfriend had a similar opinion but he watched some of them, bless him, and made similar complaints. He would show me the shows that he liked and yes, they were pretty different‚Ä¶until he showed me The Mandalorian. \n\nNow this realisation didn‚Äôt hit me until we were on an episode where he had to help an orange lady protect a forest or something but at the end he got gifted a nice spear, and I jokingly said ‚ÄúLook, he‚Äôs got a cool new accessory to add to his outfit.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when it hit me: The Mandalorian has a lot of similarities to the types of shows that guys have dismissed for being ‚Äútoo feminine.‚Äù\n\n* The Mandalorian is trying to make it as a single parent in a tough world. \n\n* The Mandalorian‚Äôs child is cute and constantly puts him in awkward situations. \n\n* The Mandalorian is constantly trying to upgrade his look which includes montages of making his hot new outfit/accessories. \n\n* The Mandalorian is always broke, between jobs and trying to improve his living standards. \n\n* The Mandalorian has sassy sidekicks. \n\nMy ex disagreed with me and also refused to watch anymore with me because I kept getting all the names wrong. What do you guys think?\n\nTl;dr - The Mandalorian is about being a fashionable single parent in a tough world.",
