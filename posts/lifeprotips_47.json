Feelings of boredom ,aimlessness, lack of meaning/satisfaction/excitement with life, feel like I’m just going through the motions of life etc. I’m thinking it’s potentially due to Seasonal Affective Disorder. I am not diagnosed and I have not seen a medical professional about it. I take 2000 IUs of vitamin D per day in the winter. I exercise 1hour daily, work 6 days per week at 2 jobs(45hrs per week), eat a relatively balanced/healthy diet, socialize on weekends with friends/strangers, 6-8hrs of sleep per night. I’ve seen videos/podcasts of ppl boasting about the effects of getting sunlight first thing in the morning but also about cold plunges etc. I was thinking about trying to sit outside in the winter morning in a tshirt and shorts facing the sun (if it’s out) for 15 mins. Maybe that’s ridiculous LOL but I was going to give it a try. It’s about -10c where I’m at right now. Anyways, wondering if anyone has tried anything similar or what other people’s tips for S.A.D. are. Thank you!\n\nTl;dr feeling down lately maybe due to S.A.D. What helps you through S.A.D.?",

Understood in a tough labor market these may not be able to be used and for those job seekers I hope you find a great landing spot.\n\n**Manager and Company:**\n\n\"If one of your long-term employees, say of over 5 years was to get sick for an unknown extended period of time what would you do?\"  This one in particular can be very telling as it's not a common question and there are several answers that they may deem \"right\" but will actually be a red flag. For example some companies have asked their employees to donate vacation time. It should also not throw any red flags on their part because you're asking about how they treat their longest serving employees. You're looking for how long they covered their salary, how long they would keep a job open for and what the expectations are of the other workers in the mean time.\n\n\"What's the average tenure and turnover of your employees?\"\n\n**Company:**\n\n\"How is your company's approach to employees better than others in your industry?\" If it's just 401k/benefits etc. that's fine, but if they aren't talking about mentoring, training, independent work, flexible work schedules that tells you a lot by their omission (while again not throwing any red flags on you because you can just nod along and accept what they are saying as \"wow! that's great!\")\n\n\"When was the last time you did layoffs and how did that go?\" \n\n\"What was it like here during Covid, how did you manage to get through it.\" \n\n\"What is your turnover like?\"\n\n**Manager:**\n\n\"What happened to the person last in this position?\"\n\n\"How long have you been managing at this company and others?\" If they were only recently promoted after a long time with the company it could be concerning for 2 reason; the company may be slow to promote, and/or this person may not have leadership skills if it took that long. If they were recently promoted and have no other experience you need to dive in about how/why and what they are really good at because it may not be managing people.\n\n\"How many people have you managed in your career?\"\n\n\"What is a great style of employee for you to manage?\"\n\n\"Where have your employees gone after they left your employment?\" Stays away from \"why did they quit\" which is a little more adversarial.\n\n\"How did you get the position of manager?\"  If they were promoted this can show insights into the internal workings and also are they looking to move up and potentially need to delegate to someone?  This shows interest, lets them talk about themselves and could give you a lot of insights. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSome of these you're going to get generic answers and that's telling as well.  Also the longer the pause as they search for answers should also be informative. You shouldn't ask ALL these questions, pick the ones that are most important to you. I think a few in the first round and then a few more in future rounds would be the way to go.\n\nGood luck!",

Having assets in a family or living trust gets all the legal work done before you die. \n\nYes it takes more time and money but you spent that time and saved that money to better yourself and kids and grandkids. \n\nAlmost everything can be covered in a trust, all assets will be in the trust’s name, legal costs and time after you die is minimal. \n\nA trust can be created with less than a thousand dollars and after tax returns is a great time to do it.",
