        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10ye9dc/time_dilation_and_its_relation_to_speed/",
        "text": "Okay, so recently I have been very curious about time dilation. I understand it for the most part because of some wonderful explanations on previous posts in this subreddit, other subreddits, and other forums. The easiest to understand for me personally was the use of a vertical axis to represent time and a horizontal axis to represent speed. \n\nHowever, there are two things (maybe more?) I don't understand specifically.\n\n1) In the explanations used people were referencing how light is constant no matter your speed. This is easy for me to accept and understand. However, they stated that if light was bouncing between two mirrors on a rocketship, to an observer on the ground, the light would look triangulated because of it having to move the same distance as the rocketship to hit the other mirror. This, on paper, makes perfect sense to me because obviously if you're in a moving object the objects in that moving object are also traveling at that speed. What DOESN'T make sense to me with this is that if I were to see a car pass with a ball bouncing from the floor to the ceiling, my brain would still just register that ball as bouncing straight up and down. Technically I am seeing it move forward, but my brain doesn't register the angle it just sees a ball bounce straight up and down. That probably makes no sense and sounds like I'm just saying \"no, that isn't how it works,\" but I'm not. If I sound dumb please just tell me because I am indeed a simpleton.\n\n2) This is the one that REALLY bothers. So according to how time dilation works, when I move faster, I move through time slower. That makes sense to me theorotically, but when I start to get confused is when I think about a scenario like this: If I am in a room with my friend, and I move so fast that I can do ten things around the house in 0.1 seconds, then shouldn't he be able to do nothing in that amount of time? But according to time dilation, if I was moving that fast, he would actually see me moving extremely slowly. THAT MAKES NO SENSE DUDE. Here is another example. You're at an endless race track and you can see the ENTIRETY of it (just go with it I know this isn't possible). A car on the track starts from 0mph and accelerates. I see this car accelerate. Faster, faster, faster, faster. But based on time dilation at some point this car starts moving so fast that I actually am going to see it slow down. Can someone please explain how the hell that works because I think I might experience physical pain soon from this mind F. I guess I just want to know at what speed would you be going so fast that people start seeing you move slower? It just doesn't make sense to me. Because if you're moving that fast shouldn't you see them moving slower? Instead of the other way around? Is there like a point where this flips or something? Please help me oh my gosh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to make another post about time dilation but haven't seen anyone else ask these specific questions.",
