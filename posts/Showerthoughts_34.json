The majority are unwilling to question power and it has lead us to the point of enslavement where 99% can't survive without money. If we were so easily lead without the comforts that our labour has produced, why would our wants and needs be unshapable by the powers that be?",

        "text": "Obviously the year 2000 wasn't a real year, not in the sense that '1976' was, or '1821'. Too many zeroes for one thing. Same goes for the rest of that decade. '2006'? We were clearly still in the grace period for the new century thing that was meant to be happening.\n\nAlso, (and it's been brought up before), there's no satisfactory way to refer to that decade. I've heard 'aughts' and 'noughties', neither of which feel correct, and 'the two thousands' is ambiguous. The following decade has a similar problem. 'Tens' / 'teens'? Nah.\n\nSo with the first two decades written off we had to wait til the 20s before we got to a real year. But obviously it's not 2020 cause of the repetition. 2021 is a strong contender but ultimately suffers from proximity to all the non-years that came before it. Definitely feels like we're getting close though. 2022 is a non-starter with all the 2s, but there's nothing wrong with 2023. Certified real year, alongside 1644, 1980 and 2385.\n\nSimilarly, 1999 wasn't a proper year because of all the 9s and because pretty much the main thing about 1999 was that we were all just waiting for 2000 to start. So the last actual year before this one was 1998.\n\nSo you'll be glad to know that after 25 years we can now get back to normal.",
