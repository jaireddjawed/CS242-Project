I've decided to get incredibly mathematical, and I'm working out the amount of CO2 that is no longer absorbed by the amazon due to deforestation. I've came to the conclusion that due to deforestation, the amazon no longer absorbed over 900 million tonnes of CO2 annually which it would've absorbed prior to deforestation. \n\nHowever I need to confirm something. I worked out that there's an average of ~57,500 trees per KM2 in the amazon. Is this correct, or have I done something wrong? The number seems unrealistic, but I've done everything right to come to that conclusion. \n\nAny feedback appreciated. Thanks.",

However, I also went to two different community colleges, and in one I got a gpa of 3.4 and the other was a 2.7. Needless to say, I really screwed up my first two years of junior college and got some F's in some science classes. Now that I'm at a 4-year, however, I've gotten good research experience and have worked for two different labs. I am planning on taking the GRE next semester. Basically my question is how competitive am I to get a position as a research assistant at a graduate school in the field of conservation? What could I do to make myself more competitive?
