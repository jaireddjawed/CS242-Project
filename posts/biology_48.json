        "text": "During glycolysis, two molecules of triose phosphate are oxidised because they lose electrons. This reaction involves the coenzyme NAD+ (oxidised form) because NAD+ molecules receive electrons from the triose phosphate. Therefore, NAD+ is reduced to form NADH.\n\nMy question is... what exactly is removed from the triose phosphate molecules and what exactly does the NAD+ collect during this oxidation-reduction reaction?\n\nI have read several different websites and textbooks that all give slightly different answers. Some places say the NAD+ collects hydrogen atoms, some say it collects electrons, and some say it collects both.\n\nI also read this answer from a trustworthy textbook: Principles of Anatomy &amp; Physiology (Tenth Edition) by Tortora and Grabowski: 'Oxidation occurs as two molecules of NAD+ accept two pairs of electrons and hydrogen ions from two molecules of G 3-P, forming two molecules each of NADH'. This answer really confused me. It sounds like it says each NAD+ receive two electrons and two hydrogen ions. Could anyone help explain it means?\n\n2NAD\\^+ -&gt; 2NADH + 2H\\^+\n\nFrom my understanding, NAD+ receives a hydride anion (H-), which consists of one proton and two electrons. For NAD+ to become NADH it must receive a hydride anion to neutralise the charge and add hydrogen (H). However, from the equation above there are 2 hydrogen ions in addition to two NADH.\n\nCould someone please help confirm the answer for me? Thank you",

And i found some genes with their positing (Using some bioinformatics)  in whole genome sequence of the bacteria. But this resistance sequence is joining or some portion is overlapping with some genes and those genes carry  immunomodulatory function in the bacteria. \n\nNow my question is, this is how bacteria develop resistance to use some conserved sequence around  corresponding genes ( immunomodulatory function carrying genes) to change (self acquiring mutation process) so that the translational product of those immunomodulatory function carrying corresponding genes to change or alter the proteins conformational changes for altering the drugs target?  \n\nOr, Bacteria code a new gene which responsible for drug resistance? \n\nHope i made my questions clear. I badly need the answers.  If any more queries help you to give me the solution, please let me in the comment section or dm me.",

Aside from that course, I only have one course in the way of my graduation. \n\nI've been given the option to either drop the FIN completely (and retake the course) or revert it to a C. My GPA can survive that just fine nor am i particularly worried about the lecture material.\n\nMy concern is that I don't feel like I retained anything from the labs: anything in terms of protocols, common reagents, etc. At least nothing beyond basics. \n\nKeeping in mind this was at the tail end of covid quarantine and remote labs, will labs I apply to accept a lack of practical experience? I've worked in chemistry labs in the past, but that doesn't exactly translate...\n\n\nShould I just take the C, despite this being my penultimate grade, and probably my final lab experience before applying to jobs? I feel pretty underprepared to enter the bio workforce. \n\nAm I just horribly overthinking this?\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback, thank you",

So I'm wondering should I take ochem and it's lab by themselves in the fall or should I tough it out this semester and take biochem and some other upper class science course in the fall? I know as a senior I should have had this figured out by now but I'm really scared of ochem hurting my GPA and me not doing well in it. 🥲🥲",

Or what do you think would happen? Do you think that those animals would evolve into that way or would they just stay on the trees and live their best life?",

It sounds like it's either warning another animal or feeling threatened by it. I've been trying to search online for these kind of sounds, but so far haven't been successful in finding one that matches. Does anyone have any idea?",

        "text": "Hi all, I suppose I’d like to come here to ask for some advice.  I’m currently a senior (graduating this spring) at a well-regarded Big Ten school with a major in EEEB (ecology, evolution, and environmental biology) and a current GPA of 3.97.  (I’m open to most biology subdisciplines though.  If I could go back I would honestly probably choose a different subdiscipline in something like computational biology or biotech, or even a non-biology major like environmental/ecological engineering, although I suppose my indifference to EEEB careers despite an interest in the material is a separate issue) The problem is that I only really became a person about 9 months ago!  I’ve never worked a day in my life and don’t really have any other skills besides very basic Python and not-even-conversational Japanese. From \\~13 to 21 I was a shut-in with no offline social life and no extracurricular experience.  I’ve made some minor progress this year in working past that - I’ve improved a lot socially (including transitioning, which fixed the main reason I was a shut-in) and I have done some event planning work for a non-major related club as well as volunteering as a panelist for some student talks.  My current plan is to try to get into an undergrad research position for my last semester and go to career fairs/apply to jobs to see if I can get lucky with my barren resume.  The former seems doable since I’m active in classes and a bit of a teacher’s pet so my past professors like me.  The latter is a lot more far fetched, I think, given my lack of experience.  Should I fail to find any real opportunities before the semester is starting to wrap up, I plan on applying to internships for this summer to try to get more experience.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation and had luck getting a job?  Is there anything else I should be trying to do/looking out for?  Also, how difficult is it generally to pivot a degree in one subdiscipline to a position in another? Thanks, apologies if this post is a bit of a mess.",
