        "author": "Zardotab",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/11t0gg6/a_restaurant_analogy_for_microservices/",
        "text": " \n\nSuppose the restaurant industry coined the term \"MicroYumming\" for cooking food that tastes good to restaurant customers. People are unsure if it's a specific *way* to cook food, or just a buzzword for \"make it yummy\", which cooks have been trying to do forever. (Compare to general advice of \"modularize &amp; partition apps better\" per microservices.)\n\nThere's an implication that MicroYumming means using more spices and less oil, but few promoting the idea want to commit to it meaning that and only that. Others say it's more about the cook communicating with customers to learn what they want. I ask if that's required to be considered MicroYumming, but other MicroYum promoters disagree.\n\nThe term indirectly came from a big restaurant \"Foodflix\" that grew in popularity using specific techniques. It's clear that not all those techniques will apply to some types of food and restaurant styles and sizes. Most agree many of the techniques are specific to Foodflix's niche and shouldn't all be copied verbatim for all restaurants.\n\nThe implication is that different restaurants should pick and choose those specific Foodflix techniques that fit their particular restaurant. But there's no clear guidelines on which applies to what. I try to come up with a \"rule matrix\" of sorts to narrow down which sub-aspects apply to which restaurant type, but am told \"it's becoming clear you just don't get it\", and no MicroYum promoter want's to help with the chart nor commit to confirming my candidate rules.\n\nThe implication is that if one studies it harder and reads enough MicroYum books, they'll **\"just have a feel\"** for which parts of MicroYumming apply to which restaurant. Whether different MicroYum proponents would come to similar conclusions for a specific restaurant is unknown, but my gut feeling is they wont, since they never agree on too many things in discussions.\n\nIn the end the term causes more confusion than useful help to restaurant owners and cooks. It has all the smells of a nasty buzzword. Ambiguous terms are often worse than no terms.",

I've been trying to find work for the past month through freelancing and job searching, but I'm not having any luck. I'm hoping that someone in this community might be able to help me out with some practical advice and feedback.\n\nI have a CV and a GitHub account that showcase some of my skills. Here are the links:\n\nCV: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAho\\_kI5XwkYK7szNxKMqZpO6wipKg3h/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAho_kI5XwkYK7szNxKMqZpO6wipKg3h/view?usp=sharing)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/rikiraspoutine/](https://github.com/rikiraspoutine/)\n\nDespite having a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I'm finding it difficult to land even an interview for a junior web developer position. I've been applying to various job listings on job portals like Indeed, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter, but to no avail.\n\nOne of the challenges I face is that many entry-level job postings seem to require several years of experience in a multitude of programming languages. This makes it difficult for new developers like myself to gain the necessary experience to get hired.\n\nI'm passionate about coding and always eager to learn more. In fact, I've been teaching myself React on the side to increase my skillset.\n\nSince I live in Algeria, I'm primarily looking for a remote job opportunity. Do you have any advice on where I can find remote job listings? And do you have any suggestions on how I can improve my chances of landing a remote job as a junior web developer?\n\nI'm open to any suggestions or feedback that anyone has to offer. Thank you in advance for your time and help.\n\nHAPPY CODING !",

        "text": " Ah, C#. Where do I even begin? Let me tell you a story about this fascinating programming language.  (there must be meme image, but it\\`s now allowed here :D)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fg4f1a91dpla1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be529aa317bfbd0ab923071f04c33a64b4b04358\n\nBack in the late 1990s, Microsoft had a problem. They wanted to develop software for their Windows operating system, but the language they were using at the time, C++, was proving to be too cumbersome and error-prone. They needed a new language that would be easier to use, more efficient, and **more flexible**.\n\nEnter **Anders Hejlsberg**, a Danish computer scientist who had previously worked on the design of Turbo Pascal and Borland Delphi. Hejlsberg was tasked with creating a new language for Microsoft, and he began work on what would eventually become C#.\n\n**Hejlsberg‚Äôs goal was to create a language that combined the power of C++ with the ease of use of Visual Basic**. He drew inspiration from a number of other programming languages, including Java, C++, and Delphi, and set to work designing a language that would be **both powerful and easy to use**.\n\nThe **first version of C# was released in 2000**, and it quickly gained popularity among developers. One of the reasons for its success was its close integration with Microsoft‚Äôs .NET Framework, which provided a set of libraries and tools that made it easy to build powerful Windows applications.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj5s29njdpla1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6690e2eae4413854d7696839dea09f8beb9c6bc\n\nIf you like this parts, you can read [**full article here**.](https://tophistoryman.medium.com/how-c-become-one-of-the-most-popular-programming-languages-4d165e4125e0) Feel free to comment here or on the Medium, I\\`m happy to have some feedback.
