I love the aesthetics of the grinder, and it does it’s job, but I find i am no longer making espresso as it takes too long in the morning. So I got a v60 and a French press. When I set the mignon to its coarsest setting, I find i am getting a lot of fines, and the grind seems somewhat inconsistent. Is there anything I can do to improve this or is this just the nature of using espresso oriented grinders for coarser grinds?",

I picked up two bags each from two specialty roasters near me, in addition to a grocery store brand. I'm fairly certain everything here is a medium-light to medium roast. Everything was ground to what I think is a pretty neutral medium (#18 on Baratza Encore.)\n\nMy scale only has 1g precision, so I tried to add only 9g of ground beans to each cup. Then brewed with 150ml of boiling water for 4 mins before stirring to stop the brewing. \n\n[photo](https://i.imgur.com/ldwx38V.jpg)\n\nThe 5 beans I used were (from left to right):\n\n1. Aldi Simply Nature Organic Honduras\n\n2. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe \n\n3. Guatemala Antigua \n\n4. Costa Rican patio dried\n\n5. Ethiopian Sidamo natural processed\n\n\nI'm such an amateur at this that unfortunately I really don't have any great tasting notes to describe. Overall I found it easiest to differentiate between the body and acidity than I did flavor. \n\nThe Guatemalan seemed to have a lot less body, which comparatively felt like I was drinking tea. Most of the others were pretty similar.\n\nThere were some minor differences in acidity between them, but nothing I could really consistently call out.\n\nI was a little disappointed that I felt like I was getting floral notes in all of them. I was kind of hoping to get a chocolate or nut like flavor in some versus others. Maybe I need to try different roast levels in order to work myself towards being able to tell those differences.\n\nOverall it was a fun experience and I'm glad I tried it. If anything it showed me how easy it was to set up, and hopefully in the future I'll be able to taste more diversity between each cup.",

Growing up you used to be able to go damn well anywhere and buy a single Styrofoam shit out cup of yesterday mornings coffee for a dollar in a pinch, and nowadays you have to go out of your way to still find that.\n\nThis realization has led me along to seeing that the way I was downing coffee, drink after drink, mindlessly enjoying whatever was the most bearable en masse was never okay.

I am using the cone filter with a Melitta n. 4 filter. Coffee being used is from Counter Culture.",

There is talks of it being \"tech\" focused, but it looks like they simplified the menu, made the coffee faster to make (with a new expresso machine?), saved rent on space by removing sit down, and reduced overhead my having fewer employees per shop. With the capital they raised, they are able to expand quickly while also contributes to shorter waits for coffee. \n\nSoooo, where does the tech come it? They have an app that rewards customers that are returning, but that is just what \"tech\" start ups do to acquire new customers. However, in the process they burn cash in the hopes that once they've acquired a large enough user base then it will figure itself out. \n\nSo, what is so special about what they are doing compared to other coffee shops if they are focused user acquisition and burning cash to do that. Their margins are lower compared to their competitors, but at a certain point, the deals stop and the price will rise.\n\nSo where does the \"tech\" part come in? How are they using tech to improve the business? Is it just gamification?",

Just great coffee and flavor no matter the origin or roast level. \n\n**Favorite Bag of Coffee**: Hamasho has been a real pleasure this year, but the one from [Touchy Coffee](https://touchycoffee.com/products/ethiopia-hamasho) was astounding. Snapple peach tea with heavy elderflower notes. Just a great bag of coffee especially for the gram to price ratio.\n\n**Favorite First Time Roaster**: Quite a few amazing ones, but [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/collections/coffee) really lived up to the hype. Just one bag was enough for me to put them in my top 4 for North American roasters. No matter how I brewed the coffee it came out great.\n\n**Favorite Single Origin**: Some of the best and most diverse coffee I had this year came from Ethiopia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBonus: I signed up for a [Luna coffee subscription](https://enjoylunacoffee.com/product-category/coffee/) and I have no regrets. I really like how unique the coffees are compared to other North American roasters and the booklet is a joy to read. Also just signed up for Black &amp; White's Black Label Subscription. Not a coffee subscription, but Fellow's drops is always something I look forward to checking out.",

        "text": "Tim Horton’s Medium Blend\n$6 on Amazon\n\nOverall Grade: D\n\nPros:\n- Relatively fresh\n- Smells great\n- No roast discrepancies\n- Average caffeine level\n\nCons:\n\n- Poor bag material\n- Small, inconsistent beans\n- Overly acidic flavor\n- Flavor is not strong enough to handle cream\n\nTim Horton's is a well-known coffee franchise in Canada with a mixed reputation. After hearing about the brand, I decided to give it a shot and purchased a bag of their coffee from Amazon. I was surprised to find out that the bag was made of that dreadful, flimsy, difficult-to-reseal plastic. However, because the beans within were not exposed to much air, the Co2 valve and bag seal appeared to be working. However, with closer inspection, I discovered that the beans were small and inconsistent. Despite this violation, the beans broke down well and brewed just fine in my pour over.\n\nI appreciated the pleasant aroma of this coffee, which is a fine blend of caramel, chocolate, and roasted marshmallows with a well-tamed roasty coffee scent. It’s inviting, but not overpowering.\n\nThe flavor of this coffee is like nothing I could have expected. It’s super, super bright - as bright as coffee could possibly be. It's highly acidic, with a flavor similar to green apples and lemons. The coffee has a thick body with a mellow finish, and its caffeine strength is normal. I’m not keen on acidic flavors, so this coffee is definitely not something I would drink ever again. I can see how some people might enjoy it though. With cream, this coffee really doesn’t hold up. It kind of just goes totally flat. \n\nWhile Tim Horton's Medium isn't the worst coffee I've ever had, it falls short of many of my expectations. As a result, I give it a \"eh\" rating of D and will never recommend this blend to anyone. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have finally tried Tim Horton's and can now speak on it.",

I liked to get my coffee from them as the employee cafeteria was on the other side of the hotel, and the coffee was always garbage. When she was working, I'd drink coffee all day. I'm sensitive to caffeine so I would normally stop drinking after noon. But if she was working, I'd keep getting refills up until her shift ended. I'd be tweeking by the time she clocked out. She told me fairly recently she would always keep coffee available, even after they were supposed to stop brewing for the day, just so she could give me a refill. Years later, we both still love a good cup of coffee and this sub has helped inspire me to up my coffee game.",

While usually it's enough to tap the container to get most of the ground coffee out, with this is impossible, it seems glued to the container even if I slightly wet the beans beforehand.\n\n* usually i try to aim for 60 to 90 g of water for 30g of coffee for the blooming phase. This coffee seems to absorb a massive amount of water and even 100 g are not enough to obtain the coffee \"sludge\" i usually do.\nNot only that, as soon as I wet the coffee it creates an incredible amount of bubbly foam that fills the entire cone. I've tried 4 or 5 different coffees until now and this is the first time I saw this happen! \n\n* at the end of the extraction I always obtain an uneven bed, and as you can imagine the end result is quite poor.\n\nI tried googling the most common issues but couldn't find a solution.\nI tried grinding a bit finer or coarser, no big change.\nShould I use (way) more water during the blooming phase?

Are there any really good ones folks recommend?",
