        "text": "When I was an undergraduate student, I worked at the cafeteria on campus.  One of the jobs is taking out the trash.  The dumpsters were in back, adjacent to the parking lot.  \n\nWhile making the rounds to collect the garbage, I'd go through the kitchen and past various racks of supplies: big canisters of clorox, dish soap, toilet paper, paper towels, ...  mostly bulk cleaning supplies.\n\nThe technique was to open 2 trash sacks, one was opened around the rim, and the other hidden underneath it.  As I'd wheel through, people would only see the trash filled sack.  When nobody saw, I'd pull the trash sack aside, and throw supplies into the other sack. \n\nOutside, I'd park the barrel so it was out of view of the door of the cafeteria, unload the trash into the dumpster, but then quickly hide the other bag behind the dumpster.  The key was to do this on the last round of trash collection, immediately before the end of the shift.\n\nAfter clocking out, I'd saunter out -- the plan was that if anyone else noticed the sack of goods then I'd just whistle past and have no connection to it; otherwise, I'd quickly toss it in my car parked right there.\n\nMy roommate also worked in the cafeteria, and we both applied the same techniques.  For literally 2+ years, we never had to buy any cleaning supplies.",

The only thing I struggle with in writing is the spelling. I was with some of my ex friends (I am no longer friends with them after this). All of them in honors and all come from pretty wealthy families. I heard one of the girls in there who we are going to call Veruca complain about having to write a 500 word essay. I told Veruca that I can help her because I can write a 500 word essay in like 3 hours. She told me no because I'm in special ed classes. I told her she was lucky to be an honors in general. Everyone at the table gassed and told me how I don't know anything. I pulled out my notebook and handed it to them and told them I written all of that within a month it was a 700 page notebook and I have written an over 500 pages of it. They were really shocked and I told them they should be happy that they're an honors because they're more likely to get scholarships and stuff like that in honors then in special ed. I don't have a chance of getting that. They told me how hard it is to be an honors and how much pressure they have in this and that and the other. I ended up just storming out. So am I wrong and if I am can you please tell me how",

        "text": "3 years ago we started listing products on eBay that had been sat in our warehouse for a long time. \n\nWe make very minimal margins after fees but the way we see it is; making ANYTHING + freeing up space for new products = a win. \n\nSo about 2 years ago my boss told me to do another surplus stock list to put on eBay. While compiling the list, I did some research to see what the items were selling for and they were good value items. We paid £19 per item (roughly) and they were selling on eBay for £45\n\nI decided with the 20 items we had, I'd sell 15 items on the company's eBay and 5 on my personal eBay. \n\nAll went through as ususl. Boss was happy he'd made some money off items fit for the bin, I'd made a tidy little profit.  \n\nI did this a few times then panicked that I'd be caught with eBay somehow. So I had to get a bit smarter - but considering my boss is a bit of a dinosaur, this wasn't too difficult... I just started packaging up items and putting them in my van (to take the \"post office\") before going home and putting the items on my wife's Facebook marketplace and selling the items for cash. I've also sold items in pubs, to friends, at bootsales etc etc  \n\nWe've all but shifted the surplus stock now and to date I have no idea just how much money I've stolen but it's quite substantial. \n\nThe reason for my confession is because today I received a promotion and a hefty pay rise and I am almost feeling guilty for my actions... Almost.",

        "text": "TL:DR - Placed tiny, benign LED motherboards around my old work office to concern my boss. He is leaving the building after not being confident he found all the devices. \n\nI don't need a throwaway for this as it was years ago. The owner of an IT company I used to work at had an unfortunate response to a companywide IT incident. I won't go into details of what happened, but it affected all 30-ish of us to some extend.\n\nThe next week we had to implement absurdly strict security policies to lock down our environment, which we had already done. You can't plan for human factor as much as you would like in IT, but you can put your best foot forward and hope for the best.\n\nFast forward a year and we were slogging along in this new system with \\~20 of the employees, myself included, annoyed with it. Turnover had been on the uptick and I was looking to leave myself.\n\nWell the owner had found my updated resume in Indeed and called me out on it in our weekly meeting. I told him how he was overly paranoid and it caused my work to be inefficient, disengaging, and lackluster. I was basically told \"If you think we're locked down, you probably don't need to work here, because we have holes everywhere.\" \n\nMy job is to close those holes, so if you want me to leave, so be it. I found a new job a few months later in a different industry, but I am not one to take disrespect, even from the person who signs my paycheck. So while I was applying for new jobs I was also buying mini motherboards with various LED lights that flashed slowly every few seconds. I bought 15 of them and placed them around the office randomly; in a plant here, in the conference room vent, under the rim of a desk by his office.\n\nFast forward again a few months and I finally get a text from a coworker who was in on the joke. The owner found one of my \"espionage\" devices and promptly had a company come in to find and clear the bugs. The only problem is, they aren't transmitting any data, so they don't emit much of a signal at all.\n\nMy buddy left the organization a year ago. Last I heard they had found 12 out of 15 'bugs', but the owner recently put in a bid for a new building rental in the industrial district they are in. He must be quite concerned.",

I feel a little bad about it because she is my best friend and it’s her ex bf, but it only happened because Dan and I were drinking and they’re not dating anymore. She seems over him I think.

        "text": "Time goes on and on, yet still, it feels as if the clock has frozen. Days have gone by and yet still I'm trapped in what feels like neverending pain. But it isn’t pain as one would normally feel, it is pain that hurts like a fire that never burned. Pain that pierces deep despite there being no wound. Pain that really isn't pain. It is pain that is misery. It is pain that is sorrow. It is the pain of despair. \n\nWhen I first realized that there was mutual interest, I was ecstatic. Usually, it is no big deal, but this girl was different. There was something about her that was different from other girls. Aside from the fact that she wasn’t American, there was clearly something different about her that drew me to her. \n\nThe way she carried herself, like a queen walking past her constituents, was breathtaking. Her beauty is unmatched by almost all others at the school. The perfectly kept blonde/red hair and her deep blue eyes. Eyes that you could stare into and get lost forever. \n\nDays prior were spent talking, learning all about her, and planning out things for us to do. In conversation, kindness overflowed from her lips and it was clear that I had fallen for her. Within the first two days of talking to her, I was hooked. Her words were like nicotine, filling me up and suffocating me. \n\nEven though I barely knew her, there was something different about talking to her. She made me laugh all the time and I thought that I made her laugh too. Her words fascinated me bringing me closer and closer to her thoughts. Learning about European culture and the difference between there and America was a perspective that I never was able to get before. I appreciated her sharing that with me. We texted for two days before deciding to finally meet for the first time. \n\nMy heart was beating so fast. As I was driving to school, it felt like my heart was about to jump out of my chest. My palms were sweaty as I gripped the wheel. Will she like me? Will I look good enough for her? Will I embarrass myself? Thoughts of self-destruction began racing through my head as they always do when I get nervous. I was praying to myself that I would be able to curb my nerves and not make a fool out of myself. \n\nWhen I was walking up to her, I just about melted. Seeing her for the first time, I was truly infatuated. She had these adorable freckles on her cheeks and she was wearing a beautiful outfit that complimented her features perfectly. We had a quick talk about valentines day and what else we were doing that day; she also gave me her flowers. No one has ever given me flowers before. \n\nThis act actually meant so much to me because I didn’t think anyone wanted to give me flowers. For the past two years, I have been struggling to find people to surround myself with, both romantically and platonically. I know it is a terrible mindset, but as time has gone on, I just keep talking down on myself because it is the only thing that makes sense in my mind. \n\nEvery girl that I go on dates with likes to text me, they agree to meet up for a date, and they come on the date, but no one ever comes out for a second one. It is a terrible feeling not knowing what you're doing wrong. Is it the personality? I’m not sure because if it was, then I feel like they wouldn't keep texting me for days. Is it my looks? If it was, I don't see why they would come out on the first date at all. If it's neither of those things, what could it be? \n\nAfter she gave me the flowers and we departed, I was so nervous that she wouldn’t text me back. I texted her and thanked her again and told her that it was very sweet and she replied back. That was a good sign because that means that she at least kind of liked the way that I looked. \n\nFor the rest of the day, we continued to text and I really believed that this was going somewhere. Somewhere where I wanted it to go. She invited me to go ballroom dancing with her and I was so excited. I’ve never gone ballroom dancing and no girl has ever invited me to do anything like that. I knew that I would embarrass myself, but that didn’t really matter. I was just excited to get to spend time with her and show her who I really am. \n\nAs the hours rolled on in the day growing closer and closer to the ballroom dancing, I got more nervous. She gave me butterflies in my stomach as I was getting ready; making sure that I smelled good and was wearing a nice outfit. Once I finally was finished, I got into my car and headed to school to meet her. \n\nUnfortunately, when I met her, she told me that the ballroom dancing had been canceled. We decided to go and sit on a bench and talk instead. This is where I knew that it was going to go wrong. \n\nI am not good at talking to people, especially those which I don’t know. It takes time for me to get to feel comfortable and really open up. Ballroom dancing would have allowed me to embarrass myself, make her laugh, as well as get to know her, and be more open. Instead, I had to talk to her open-ended for two hours about things that I knew neither of us cared to talk about. \n\nWe were just filling the air with words making the time go by until one of us felt brave enough to say “I think it's time for me to go home.” The conversation wasn’t romantic at all and solely consisted of her bashing America (for good reason) and me asking her questions about Europe. \n\nWhen she finally said that it was time for her to go, I ended up walking her to her car and giving her a hug. No matter how much I wished to go on a second date with her, I knew that wasn’t going to be the case. I texted her and told her that I really liked hanging out with her and that I would love to do it again if she wanted to. I really was hoping that she said yes just so that I had the chance to come out of my shell and show her that we really could have become something. \n\nAs I was driving home, I saw that she liked both of my messages and responded back “I really enjoyed talking to u to….”. This made my heartbeat increase and I really thought that I made it. I thought she wanted this to go somewhere. When I finally got home and checked the rest of the message, it read, “I really enjoyed talking to you but I didn’t feel a spark.” My heart sank down into the deepest pits of my chest. Literally, the only thing that I wished not to happen, happened. \n\nI just stared down at the screen for a second processing what I was looking at. Even though I knew this was the probable outcome, it still broke me. Not because I was attached to her or because I loved her, but because I really thought that it was going somewhere. Within the course of two hours, I am back at stage one with no one and no future interests. \n\nI told her that I completely understood and that whoever does bag her will be a lucky guy. Despite saying these things, I truly was upset. I thought about all that I could have done differently. Even though the ballroom dancing was canceled, I could have asked her to dance with me on the field in front of the Webb center. I could have asked her if she wanted to go somewhere or get food with me. I could have talked more about what she was looking for and made the conversation more intimate. Instead, I sat there intimidated by her beauty unable to even think of something for us to talk about. \n\nI fumbled the bag big time. I really wanted to take her out and date her throughout the entire time she was in the US. I wanted to show her that America isn’t all terrible and that there is beauty in the chaos. I wanted to show her that not all American men are trashy. I wanted to show her that she deserved love. I wanted her to feel loved. I wanted her to feel my love. \n\nInstead, I sit here writing this document trying to dump my emotions onto paper so that it is easier for me to deal with them in my head. Trying to figure out where I went wrong, and what I could have done differently. I do appreciate her for giving me that experience and for giving me the flowers. Despite nothing coming from this little interaction, she still did something for me that no one else has and I really did appreciate that. \n\nThe pain spoken of earlier is not one which can be fixed easily and that is why it is the worst type of pain. Physical pain is temporary and is much easier to relieve. Emotional pain sticks with you like a knife you can't seem to pull out. No matter how hard I try to ignore what happened and think about other things, all I can think about is her. \n\nAll I can think about is what I could have done wrong to mess up the situation for myself. All of the things I could have said to turn her off. For the past two days, these thoughts have been bouncing around in my head and I can't escape them. I just think about her and how much I liked talking to her. Then I think about how a few more dates between us could have blossomed into a loving relationship. And then I think about how all those thoughts are pointless because I only got a glimpse into her life and that is all that I will ever get. \n\nI know it sounds corny but within those five days, I really grew to like her and I honestly could see myself with her down the line. A glimpse into her life in Europe, a glimpse into her perspective on America, a glimpse into her perspective on life. But that's all I got, just a glimpse. A quick snapshot. And that was all I was able to take with me; just a glimpse. \n\nAnd further down the line looking back on this experience, I may be with someone, or I may still be lonely. I may have lots of friends and I may have none. But I will always remember sitting down on that bench with her for the first time getting to see a glimpse into her eyes.",

        "text": "I have always checked out older women who are nicely dressed at supermarkets and department stores. Simetime they excite my interest because they are wearing nice dresses and have nice pantyhosed legs . It's hard to tell whether or not thry realize a man is becomuing happiy aroused just looking at them! These days one does not usually see women dressed so invitingly even if they are older. I recall one in particular, from about 4 years ago, before the Covid epidemic. It was in the dairy section of a local supermarket. What excited me was  that I could see she was very elderly,petite had really nice done up silver heair and I could see a lacy slipedge peek-aboo-ing out of her instirtutional thin blue dress underneath her coat. The slip got me because I am very kinky even though I did not care at all for her boots-which of course were necessary!f I guess it's just a \"mommy\" thing. I wanted to get closer to her -which I did=but I could talk to her-which I often find exciting with women because she had , I would guess an assistant from the adult home who was helping her with her shopping! She was not a pretty woman, but she had great silver hair-just done up! How many ladies from adult homes like to wear lacy slips at their advanced ages!i I fantasized about her legs,feet and toes(in pantyhose presumably . Hopefully ,incredibly smooth shaved little legs there. I kind of went to another aisle and then orbited  back to see her and  think my thoughts! As usual, I could feel my erection happily growing in my jeans! I wished I could be her boyfriend at the adult home. I wished I could kiss and hug her tight-feeling her everywhere! . About 20 years ago i had belonged to a seniot's club as a man somewhat younger than many of the ladies and I found if you wanted to kiss many of them-you could-without problem! Sadly, rimes have changed! I would love to have taken that little granny home! Guide her hand to my penis on the way there! O.M.G. Take her to a nice store , or store and buy her some nice lingerie and see her briefly in some stiletto heels before I slowly undressed her! When I got home I thought about her happily -and  masturbated! I hope she is still alive but I doubt it because she was very elderly! God! What very petite older women do for me!",

The first few times we did this, he caught on right away because, of course, the bottle had less in it.  So, In a stroke of genius, my step brother says \"We could just refill it with water\" to which I, in my brilliance, said no, we should use sweet tea so the color doesn't change.  \nWe did this for years after and felt so damn smart.  Like, we never got caught or anything....  \n\n\nThat was until we were adults and old pops told us he knew the whole time and that the bottle he had in the cabinet was the old grog level crap and he kept the real whisky hidden away!    \nSo, yeah, we had smart ideas.  We just also had a male figure who didn't wait for us to try, he already knew we were gonna be up to no good and fooled us from the jump!  \n\n\nI miss that man.",
