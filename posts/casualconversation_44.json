If I sit up completely straight with my legs out in front of me, I'm stretching. \n\nSo, lately, I've been sitting on the floor and it's been magical. It's like I'm stretching by just doing what I normally do, which is spend a lot of time on my computer. When I go to sleep and wake up, my back feels *amazing*!\n\nI'm currently sitting at my coffee table on a meditation cushion and doing homework in between Reddit surf sessions. Also, apparently, being able to get off the ground with your legs is a sign of health.\n\nI think I'm gonna try to keep this up! \n\nHave you ever tried anything and found it to address your problems with minimal effort?",

I’d still prefer brain freeze since the pain doesn’t last as long. In terms of pain, though? I’d have to give this one to brain freeze. \n\nAm I the only one who thinks that brain freeze is one of the worst pains that most people will experience in their lifetime? (Short duration aside)",

You guessed it! It's also A.I generated. This type of content is made by channels who pump around a dozen videos a day and, while most of them get a few thousand views, one eventually 'hits it off' with the algorithm and gets a few million.  \n\n\nWhat concerns me is that most viewers in the comments don't seem to notice when a video is A.I generated, mass-produced garbage, and it's concerning.

I (21f) am dating R (27m) and we have been dating for four months going into five at the end of this month, and honestly they are the best months of my life. we knew each other from his work for about a year and only started going into the talking stage to once i started working there as well. after three months of talking we made it official. now that we are caught up. \n\ni have talked to many guys before R, and liked many before to even started dating a few but they were all crushes that started with me seeing them for the first time and liking their appearance at first. R was the first person that his appearance didn’t draw me completely. Don’t get me wrong i think my boyfriend is hot and very attractive but that wasn’t what made me fall for him. \n\nOnce we started talking, i got to see his real\npersonality and who he was as a person. in my opinion i’m not a shallow person, personality does play a big part with me liking someone. with that being said, i just noticed after all these months of dating him, the main reason we’re still together is that i love his personality. all my previous relationships ended because i started to dislike their personality and how they would present themselves to others (as well as treated others). sure these guys would be seen as attractive to the point i would be told i was lucky to even pull them but they were just that to me. attractive. their personality never caught my attention for very long and i just felt bored after a month. \n\nmaybe i’m still learning life and love but i thought of it like this, if you like someone and you soon find out that someone has a partner, would you still try to be their friend in the end? if you say yes then you probably liked them more for their personality and if you asked no then you liked their appearance more. any insights or thoughts?",

        "text": "Ok so we know that in the first minions movie we can see the minions growing and becoming one of the first forms of life to walk upon the earth, not only that but they were also one of the very first semi intelligent species. And then as the movie goes on we find out that they have literally lived millions of years and are damn near Unkillable. We find out that for all these years that they have been searching for a boss which is how they eventually stumbled upon Gru, who accepts them and takes them into his care. But what if that was all a lie, what if Gru made directed that entire movie himself to lie about how the minions actually came into existence. I think that all this time he’s secretly been playing god and genetically engineering the minions. The reason I think this is because there is no such thing as an unkillable organism everything meets their end at some point and yet we see a minion from the first movie float into space and some how survive!? No creature should be able to survive in the infinite vacuum of space without food or water. Another thing I’m concerned about is how the hell did Gru get that entire laboratory under his house? That thing is huge and it’s inhabited by thousands of minions. How much does Gru have to pay for groceries? With that many mouths to feed its really weird that they have enough bananas and apples or whatever the minions eat to feed so many of them. What if that was also a lie what if Gru made it so they don’t have to eat, breath, or drink water. Also where the hell does Gru get all this money from!?",

        "text": "For context, I've been a forever DM in D&amp;D 5e for almost 6 years. And one of my players invited me to roll up a character for a mini-campaign she was wanting to run. This is only the 3rd character I've ever gotten to make, and the first to see the higher levels. (The DM requested we make our characters at 15th level, as she wanted to use some of the fun monsters) And so, Brimstone the fire genasi Fighter (Eldritch Knight) was born.\n\nWe actually played last night, and it was amazing. Most of the session was spent fighting against the many heads of a false hydra, scattered throughout a labyrinthian underground sewer system. And I finally got to put some of the knowledge that I've picked up from watching my usual group’s players to use. I even managed a turn where Brimstone dealt 200+ damage, and his melee combat tendencies in an otherwise ranged-focused party helped set up our Rogue for lots of Sneak Attack dice rolls with his enchanted crossbow. I've never felt so helpful to a party before - go figure, I'm usually the one who's causing trouble for them, what with the whole \"DM-controls-the-monsters\" thing, and it was just so damn nice to be on the other side of the screen.",

        "text": "I'm absolutely terrified... but for reasons you probably won't expect.\n\nIts currently 1 am, I can't sleep because my mind and thoughts have completely taken over and I have to be up in 5 hours to hit the road.\nThe university is about 6 hours away from home so it's going to be a long trip.\nI'm studying engineering, but it's a specific bridging course and they only allow about 40 students a year, so their rules are strict. Miss 3 classes and you're out, no refund.\n\nLeaving home for school isn't something new to me since I've been in a boarding school most of my high school life, so thats not something that bothers me too much.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for me at the moment is the fact that my gf is also going to university, on the other side of the country, 11 hours away. She actually already left 3 weeks ago without warning. Her parents just decide one night that she will be packing her bags and they are leaving in the morning. We didn't even get the chance to say goodbye.\nHer parents made promises that she can come home last week, and then we would have plenty of time together, but as expected, They went to Her to \"surprise\" her and then just left again without her.\nI want to see her so badly at this point.\nI'm planning on getting on a bus on friday, which is an 17 hour trip to her, spending pretty much only half of saturday with her, and then going back that sunday afternoon. I'm fine with that, and I really want to do it, but again I've hit 2 roadblocks.\nFirstly, the reviews on all the busses are HORRIBLE. People complain about awful smells, roach and other insect infestations,  and very long delayed times, sometimes having to wait 3 hours for the bus to arrive, which for me, is a huge problem since I can't miss any classes.\nSecondly.. money. I got a job at a huge mining company that I worked at for the whole month of January, which was an amazing opportunity. I did it so that I could have some extra money for uni, but for some reason I only got payed less than 3/4 of my ageed upon salary (I pay NO taxes, my gross and nett income was way under what was discussed with me) .. which was a HUGE setback honestly And with me being absolutely horrible with money clearly, I already have nothing left. I didn't get much really to begin with, but its still very upsetting. So I'm pretty much trying to sell everything I have. My telescope, guitar etc. All of which have great value to me but thats all I have left to do.\nI'm planning on having a side gig though. Ill be trying to do a tutoring job, for stuff like maths, science and IT. But im not very hopeful, because who would want to be tutored by a weird guy fresh out of high school...\nIve tried doing freelacing jobs like Fiverr and Upwork, and eventhough having a great profile (I think) offering coding jobs, photo editing, proof reading, blog writing, 3D modeling etc I still havnt been accepted by a single job.\n\nSo I just feel like I've hit a dead end. I know it might be silly but I really just want to see her again... thats all I strive for at the moment.\nIll be getting my license soon, and hopefully a car, and then ill be able to do the hour drive to the airport and fly to her instead, but for now, having a cockroach as my seat-neighbor is my best bet.",
