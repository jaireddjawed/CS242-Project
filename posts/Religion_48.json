        "text": "Since Islam is one of the three Abrahamic religions, it acknowledges and accepts all the known prophets from the ancient Hebrew scriptures and the Bible, including Adam (Adem) and the most important – Abraham (Ibrahim). \n\nAlso, the Muslims today practice circumcision and have almost the same dietary laws like the Jews have. Even the Day of Judgment, the story of Creation, Noah's Great Flood, Moses (Mussa) angels (meleks) Gog and Magog and the list goes on. So that only implies that Islam is somewhat a copy of Judaism with some borrowings from pre-Islamic pagan concepts.\n\nAnd despite all of that, Muslims had always had problems with the Jews and the Christians, often persecuting them and politically suppressing them since the very beginning of Islam.\n\nIf the Jews, Christians and Muslims worship the same God, the God of Abraham, then why have they always been in fight, wars, suppressing each other? \n\nI have read somewhere that Islam is the continuance of the religion of Abraham, and that Abraham himself was a Muslim, following a monotheistic religion. So, therefore, according to Muslims, Islam was not founded in the 6th century, but when the first man, Adam, was created by the almighty God.\n\nIs all of this, above mentioned, the \nvery quintessence of the Abrabrahamic faiths? This question comes from an agnostic man. Could the world be a better place had prophet Abraham never existed? It is debatable whether he even existed. Besides the holy scriptures, there is no historical evidence of his existence.\n\nNote that this is not hate directed towards the Muslims, the Jews and the Christians. In fact, one of my best friend is a Muslim (though not a devout one, but still believes in God/Allah). Maybe I just misunderstand some important principles of all the three Abrahamic religions.\n\nIs there any truth to my theory? Or is there something else that I, as an agnostic, should know?",

        "text": "My mom and my grandparents were always encouraging of exploring different cultures and faiths, so I wasn’t 100% settled in the bahá’í faith I was raised in. From Buddhism to Wiccan, to popular catholic religions, I dabbled in as much as I could as an outsider of the culture. Everyone was excited about sharing their beliefs and practices, where they originated from, the history behind changes. I loved it, I still do. But maybe it’s because of so many religions to consider that I never found one that I really connected with. \n\nI figure at least one of them has to be right though. From the earliest translatable language, there’s mentions of gods. Nearly every culture has them, and while it’s been said gods were created as a way to explain nature and the order of things, I want to believe there’s some truth to ancient and modern religions. But once death, and the soul/consciousness is involved, I don’t believe in anything- even though I want to. \n\nThis year, I started working in a funeral home while going to school to be a mortician. I love it. I do it because I don’t have to deal with my “clients” talking back to me, and if they do, something is seriously wrong! But also I do it to help people. Death has been around forever, but it never gets easier to deal with. Working with the dead has made me think about my own mortality a little more. \n\n\nI constantly remind myself of (I believe) Mark Twain’s quote: “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and have not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” And it gives me some comfort, but still the impending void of death makes me wish I believed in an after life. I don’t have this belief for everyone, I think people pass to whatever they believe in. Reincarnation, heaven/hell, whatever. If you believe it, you get it. My beliefs don’t effect anyone but me. \n\nBut I had an experience that made me question the lack of an after life. \nA few months back my funeral home received a lady from the county morgue. She wasn’t my first autopsy embalming, she wasn’t my first anything actually. She was very average looking, younger 40’s, and there was nothing visually wrong about her. Just a young death. But as I was taking her out of the body bag, I had this sudden, almost intrusive, thought. Simply: “she doesn’t have a soul.” It kept repeating in my mind. “She’s soulless. There’s no soul.”\n\nI’ve never had thoughts like that before, and I’ve seen some pretty horrible things. I looked at the other deceased in the room thinking it was just one of those weird things humans think about, but I didn’t think anyone else was soulless. I turned my attention back to her, and the thoughts came back, and it wasn’t just thoughts, it’s something I swear I could feel it, and they also didn’t feel like my own.. In the pit of my stomach, I knew there was just nothingness to her, but I had no reason to feel this way. \n\nI put in eye caps, and thought, “those are soulless eyes.” I dressed her, putting on a cross necklace she was found wearing, “don’t know why she has that, it won’t help her.”\nHer service had a pastor, and as they were praying the thoughts kept coming-  “it doesn’t matter. That won’t do anything for her.”\n\nTo this day, I’ve never had any similar thoughts like those. Sometimes I force myself to think it again- surely a mangled body from a car accident wouldnt have a soul. But that felt wrong, it felt that it did have a soul. \n\nSo that incident alone made me think that at least a soul exists, and it gave me some hope that religions were right, and that the soul does go to an afterlife or reincarnation. But the other night, while thinking about death, it came across me that maybe certain people just don’t have souls. Maybe I can’t find a religion because I don’t have a soul. And a soul is what draws you to one. So now I’m going back and forth on faiths, and death. ",

        "text": "resume:  I think faith is important, but I'm too skeptical to believe in anything. I also don't believe in the modern materialistic world view. Anyone who feel like me?\n\n--------\n\nI live somewhere in south america and I was raised in a very spiritualized catholic family -spiritism, buddhism, hinduism were always discussed and faith in anything was always considered necessary. Despite this, I never had much faith. Since I was a kid I was very science oriented and considered myself atheist even as a child -I never told my family about this, because they always firmly held the belief that I was destined to be a spiritualized person.\n\nI tried to believe in christianity, buddhism, african traditional religions, shamanism, nothing worked. Islam worked the best actually, but I still doubt it a lot... the idea of God makes sense, but its still hard to act like He is with me all the time and knows everything about me, etc\n\nAlso I keep wondering if God is just an idea created by people that didn't know the origins of things around us like mountains, trees, oceans, etc.. so now that we know better how this planet works, God becomes unnecessary\n\nI like to believe reality is not simply what we as humans can see or hear, but I can't have faith in anything specific. There are days in wich I feel religious and I'm able to have faith, and I feel really good. But rationally I keep thinking that God is an unnecessary concept to understand reality, while in the past, before modern science, it was necessary and thats why people came up with it\n\nI believe I would be a better person if I was religious and had faith, because I see no point in striving to be a better person if we are all going to die the same way. If God doesnt exist, I can do whatever the fuck I want with my life, as long as I don't hurt anyone. But if He exists, then I'm sure I would have the motivation to be a virtuous person and become the best version of myself.\n\nBut I'm very skeptical and in the same day I can go from believing to not believing at all because I suddently start questioning everything\n\nIslam was the religion that almost worked to me because of the values of it, the idea of tawhid and the life of Muhammad. The Qur'an is a great and beautiful book, I can't explain how an illiterate man 1400 years ago could have created such complex poetry with a message that would change humanity. Muhammad must have been a highly intelligent person or what we call nowadays \"gifted\" or even autistic -the descriptions of his way of walking and talking resemble that of autistic people. But even if he was all of this, I'm not sure it explains everything...\n\nBut on the other side, I feel like a lot of the content of the book is context based and it would make a lot of sense if Muhammad simply made up at least some parts of it to justify the actions he had to take -particularly in the later suras revealed in Medina.\n\nAnd salvation, heaven, hell, eternal punishment are things that I just can't accept. Like what about people that never heard of the true religion, or that lived before the revelation of truth, they are all condemned to hell or suffering? There are no wisdom in other cultures?\n\nThere are so many things happening outside of islam in other countries, or outside of christianity, or any religion actually... like how can one claim that their culture holds the answer to all of existance when there are people on the other part of the planet that never heard of the existance of their religion??\n\nI mean religion and faith is a good explanation to reality, but it requires so much effort... intelectual, emotional and spiritual effort\n\nthe most simple explanation is that this world is what we see, what we hear, that there is no afterlife of heaven or hell or anything....  however I feel like faith is a virtue... any of you think or feel like I do?\n\nthanks for reading this",

If communion is disrupted for a few weeks because the wine budget is slashed, if it helps to root out sexual abuse and corruption *isn’t it worth it*?\n\n* Second, sacrifice and suffering during a protest is great PR.

        "text": "I am not attacking anyone’s beliefs let me just start by saying. I was well aware of all the ins and outs of the Bible by the time I was in the 4th grade. I could recite the Old and New Testament at 7 years old, I attended a private Christian school until the 5th grade when I finally requested to be put in public school. I think everyone should believe in something.  But I think many believe in Christianity under false pretenses, and it’s something that I think more people should be aware of because it’s not something that is really broken down for people in an honest way. \n\nSo back to the explanation of my title, when you die your soul does not float up in the sky to Jesus. You don’t walk through pearly gates. This is not what the Bible teaches. The prophets never mention in the Bible that the righteous immediately go to heaven or the wicked go to hell when they die.  Jesus and his apostles did not teach this. They remain asleep in the grave until Jesus returns and raises them to immortal life (see 1 Corinthians 15:50-57). The Bible compares death to sleep more than fifty times. After death we are asleep, we are unconscious; we are not aware of the passing of time or of what is going on around us. That is what death is like as well. \n\nThe Bible says, “for the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing… their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, NKJV, see also Psalm 146:4; 115:17) So essentially you are just dead that’s it nothing happens until the resurrection occurs and Jesus returns. “For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first” (1 Thessalonians 4:16, NKJV). So this is where being a Christian comes into play this is where your belief in God would bring you back to life. God did not put a soul into man. He formed the body from the dust of the ground, and then He breathed His life-giving spirit into the lifeless body—and the result was a soul, or a living being. When a person dies, the reverse takes place. The breath of life departs from the body, and the soul no longer exists. That’s what the Bible says. “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7, NIV). At the resurrection, God reunites the body and His life-giving spirit—and the person lives again.\n\nWhen making this post I took some paragraphs from an article I read that really explained it best.  Because I have a hard time explaining it to people in my own words. So there you have it. This is just something that I don’t think many fully understand and churches dance around because it’s not really something people want to hear. I personally do not believe in one specific religion anymore. I am spiritual and like to believe something happens after death but just as easily would believe maybe nothing at all happens, but what a depressing way to think ya know? So I try to keep an open mind reincarnation isn’t any more far fetched than someone coming down from the sky and raising bodies from the grave.  People who are Wiccan aren’t evil to me. And men and women who like the same sex aren’t going to Hell. They’re going to die and sit in the ground like the rest of us. If you are Christian and already knew this great glad you are informed. If you are a Christian who still believes your soul is essentially immortal. Please do further research into your religion. \n",

        "text": "I found this sub not too long ago, and it's been interesting to see everyone share their stories. In doing so, it had me thinking more about my own beliefs and how I'm not sure where I fall since I feel I tend to be all over the place - more so now that a lot of the blogs I'd interact with have either been put on indefinite hiatus or have been abandoned by the mods.\n\nBut, I'll do my best to sum everything up as neatly as possible and try to give as much background information I can. I'm also fine with clarifying anything if it sounds like word vomit, and I'm apologizing ahead of time if I accidentally phrase anything inappropriately or possibly offensive. This also might be long, so I'm sorry about that. I just want to cover all my bases.\n\nMy background is fairly scattered. \n\nI was raised in a Christian household, and that's putting it loosely - because if it wasn't for the very few pieces of Jesus centered imagery we had, you wouldn't know and we also never went to church unless we were invited to a special occasion. I never got my first immersion experience until I went to church with a friend in my neighborhood until I was about seven or so, and while I was part of the AWANAS program for a few years, I'm not sure if I genuinely believed in God or accepted Jesus as my personal savior or not. \n\nAfter I left, I had a period of time where I felt that if God exists, then they exist in the form of remenents of the universe following the Big Bang or they exist outside the universe and have no involvement with us - like setting off a rube goldberg machine and sitting back to see what happens next. Around the time I was 12 or 13, I came to grips with that I was an atheist, and that I really did more than likely not believe in God the entire time when I went to church back then. Fast forward to my teen years, and I found a PDF copy of the Satanic Bible and I felt that much of my beliefs and life philosophy aligned with it. It was great to finally have a name to something that made sense to me, even going as far back to when I was a little kid.\n\nI can't say for sure when this next part comes in, but I want to say it was 3-5 years ago when discussions about Paganism popped up in my life; whether it was something my spouse started looking into or I did it on my own. If it was on my own accord, it was from a general fascination that I think really kicked in when I was studying Latin and how much I enjoyed learning about the stories of the gods of Ancient Rome and Greece. At some point during this, I started coming across videos about atheistic paganism and how it felt like an oxymoron. So, I checked them out to see if it was something I was missing and it eventually moved to me spending more time looking into blogs on Paganism as a whole to learn as much as I can and clear up my own misconceptions. \n\nSo, here we are now with the bulk out of the way. I'm sorry if anyone that was totally pointless and I should have just provided the tl;dr version. \n\nAs far as whether or not I believe in a higher power these days go, not really. \n\nHowever, if the name of or idea of what a God is could be applied to anything tangible or we can understand with our current knowledge of the universe and how it works, then the closest thing to that would be the universe itself; being all powerful and everywhere at once - both in its relation to us and everyone/everything around us from a biological, chemical, and atomic level. However, unlike the traditional idea of what makes a God a God, the universe isn't an intelligent or sentient being that we can interact with directly or indirectly in the form of means like prayer, miracles, or divine intervention.\n\nThe tricky part comes into play with how I view the gods themselves these days. While I don't see them as literal beings you can have a one on one relationship or interaction with, I do see them in a more symbolic way as being metaphors and allegories for their various meanings and stories behind them; such as admiring the beauty and power of a thunderstorm as a symbol of a deity like Thor without viewing him as a tangible or literal being looking out for us.\n\nI've been told by some Pagans that in a very general sense, it sounds like pantheism or humanistic paganism - but I feel like I stumble into having conflict with referring to myself as one because of the negative responses I've seen from some Pagans who say it's an oxymoron to call yourself a pagan and be atheistic. I also feel a tug of judgement from the Satanism community in a similar regard, even if it's just from a symbolic or metaphorical viewpoint about the existence of deity - which is why I've tend to stray away from calling myself a Satanist these days, but I do chime in a lot of discussions about the topic when it comes to shielding others from gross misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nIf you made it to the end of this, thanks for your time. I'm sure I'm asking a lot for something that should be simple, but I'd like to hear things from another perspective.\n\nEdit: Spelling errors",
