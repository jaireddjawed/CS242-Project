        "text": "For some years now there has been an big debate that Leviticus was intentionally edited in the 1900s to spread anti-gay propaganda. The word homosexual never appeared in the Bible, but then out of no where Leviticus 18:22 started including the word “homosexual,” despite this word, or any word like it, never being coined during the time of Israelites. Leviticus 18:22 states “Do not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable sin.” Important to note, now in 2022 this is considered the “new version” or the NLT(“new living translation”). AKA feels like a nice way to admit it was intentionally altered without admitting to it. I want to push this envelope further and ask if the famous “men shall not lie with men” was purposefully mistranslated to further push the anti-gay narrative, as some scholars now believe the original line was “men shall not lie with boys” speaking about pedophilia, not homosexuality. Scholars actually believe the earliest versions of Leviticus never even touched the subject of homosexuality. The Pope has also agreed, to a point, but the Catholic Church has been historically more progressive especially as of late since they have been losing money.",

I believe in destiny and the cyclic nature of existence, where everything exists in an eternal change of birth, growth and death, including God.\n\nThe main problem I have is that I believe all these things purely on intellectual level; I feel almost no connection to them spiritually.

        "text": "This is part 2 of my posts on the famous Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is one of the most famous and iconic Christian and religious leaders for human rights and social justice.\n\n\"*I must tell you this old story which you probably know. Sometimes it was related by Blacks when they considered their plight as victims of the injustice and inequity of racism. 'Long ago, when the missionaries first came to Africa, we have the land and they had the Bible and they say 'Let us pray'. We dutifully closed our eyes, and at the end they said 'Amen' and when we opened our eyes-why! the Whites had the land and we had the Bible....Is it the case that what the story tells would have been a bad bargain, losing one's land and all that goes with it in exchange for what? The Bible. Would it have been the case that the missionaries had pulled a fast one over the gullible blacks? I want to assert as eloquently and as unequivocally as I can that it was not so. We Blacks had in fact not struct a bad bargain. This missionaries placed in the hands of Blacks something that was thoroughly subversive of injustice and oppression*\"(In God's Hands, pg 1-2)\n\n\"*What was being asserted in the first account of creation in the Bible has an absolutely crucial relevance for our Christian faith and for our attitude to God's material creation. And so it is that, after each creative act by divine fiat God the Creator pronounces the divine approval: 'It was good'. And everything happens in an orderly fashion. On the sixth day, there are some significant changes. Previously up to the fifth day of Creation, the divine approval 'God saw that it was good'. On the sixth day the formula changes, as if to alert us that something quite momentous is about to happen. God does not say 'Let there be....'. No God, summons the divine council and says: 'Let us create man in our image and likeness.....'. And it was so. After this momentous act, when man and woman are brought into being out of nothing, the formula expressing God's approval has also changed. It does not say 'God saw and it was good'. No, the assertion is categorical and emphatic:. 'God saw everything that God had created it was* ***very*** *good. This embraces everything in creation. It gives us a huge responsibility-that we should not ravage and waste the natural resources which God placed at our disposal for our wellbeing. We must be caring, to fulfill our mandate as those who bear rule in God's name*\"(In God's Hands, pg 15-16)\n\n\"*Do you remember the story of the prophet Elijah when he had a competition with four hundred prophets of Baal(1 Kings 18:17-39)? He said to the children of Israel 'You must choose between God and Baal, the false God'. He said 'We are going to have a competition; we must choose two bulls. You, the prophets of Baal, must slaughter your bull, place it on firewood, but do not light the fire. I will take the other bull; I will slaughter it and I will place it on the firewood and I will also not light the fire. Then each group must call on his god, and the god who answers with fire, that is the real God'. So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal 'You start first: call on your god'. And the prophets of Baal danced, and they called on their god, 'Baal please hear us!'. They danced, they cut themselves, they did all sorts of things, calling out 'Baal please hear us!' But nothing happened. And Elijah was lying on the ground there and really laughing at the prophets of Baal. He said to them 'Shout louder. Maybe your god is deaf; he can't hear. Maybe he is on a holiday. Maybe your god is asleep. Maybe he has just gone'-well, in the Bible it says maybe he has gone the other side to relieve himself. The point is: our God never takes a day off. Our God is always there. Our God does not take a holiday. Our God is not deaf. Our God is never asleep. Do you remember when God spoke to Moses? He said 'I have seen the suffering of my people. I have heard their cry. I know their cry and have come down to deliver them'. When we were enslaved by the devil, God saw our suffering as a result of our slavery to the devil. God knew, God saw, and God came down in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to deliver us from our bondage. You look around Africa at this time, at God's children suffering all over Africa-the poor getting poorer, the hungry getting hungrier. You look all over Africa and you see many of God's children suffering oppression. You see God's children in prison over nothing. As God's children cry because of their bondage, as they cry because of their starvation and their hunger, God knows. God sees, God hears and God comes down to deliver his children. God comes to deliver his children from their bondage because God is a God who sides with the hungry and the poor and the marginalised*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 68-70)\n\n\"*Often and often our people are filled with despair, and they wonder, What have we done to deserve all this suffering? It is important for the church of God to tell the people of God 'Hey, Hey, Hey! Our God sees. Our God hears. Our God knows, and our God will come down and deliver us'. And we say it. We say it-in South Africa-we say to them 'Hey, Hey, Hey' We are going to be free. We are not asking for permission from the rulers of our land. We know we are going to be free'. And we say to our oppressors, 'Do you know what? We are being nice to you. We are inviting you to join the winning side. Come and join the winning side because you have already lost'. Because this is what the Bible says about the good ruler: God, give your own justice to the king, your own righteousness to the Royal Son'. Why? 'So that he may rule your people rightly and your people with justice, that he will defend the poorest, he will save the children of those in need. The good ruler will crush the oppressor. The good ruler will free the poor man who calls to him and those who need help. He will have pity on the poor and the feeble and save the lives of those in need'(Psalm 72). I'm reading from the Bible. I am not reading from the manifesto of a political party. The good ruler will redeem the lives of the needy from exploitation and outrage because their lives are precious in his sight. If you are a ruler and you are not this kind of ruler, you are in trouble. You are in real trouble with God. You are in very real trouble. We try to tell oppressors everywhere 'You are not God. You are just an ordinary human being. Maybe you have got a lot of power now. Ah ah, but watch it! Watch it. Watch it*'\"(God is not a Christian, pg 79-80)\n\n\"*It is because Christianity has a high doctrine of matter, of the world of the physical, that our holiest ceremonies and rituals rely on physical, material, tangible things as indispensable conduits for the most sublime spiritual gifts from God. Referring to this, Archbishop William Temple would say 'Christianity is the most materialistic of the great religions'. Christianity uses water, oil, bread and wine as the means of conveying God's spiritual gifts. Our all holy God did not disdain to unite pure spirit, divinity itself, with the most mundane, physical material things. Our God became a real human being, not a make believe or half phantom. Our God could be born, as we are born, of a mother who conceived, was pregnant and who suffered birth pangs just like every other human mother; who gave birth to a real human baby that cried and gurgled like any and every other baby. He assumed our humanity in all its fullness, with its strengths and its frailties; experienced all that each one of us has experienced; was tempted, not once but throughout His earthly life. Only thus could he become our saviour. As the Epistle to the Hebrews put it 'He was tempted like us, but with this difference without sin'(Heb 4:15). There is nothing that constitutes us as human that he did not know from the inside. As the bishops and theologians of the Church were to assert: 'What he did not assume, he did not redeem'. It is because of all this, that politics, economics, how people are housed, what sort of water they drink, how they are treated-all are of concern to those of us who are Christians. We are creatures of flesh and blood. We are saved not by an angel(pure spirit)-no, we were redeemed by a God(pure spirit) who became a human being, who fed the hungry, who opened the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf, who healed the sick, cleansed the lepers and forgave sins and who raised the dead to life again*\"(In God's Hands, pg 27-28)\n\n\"*We are quite bamboozled when we encounter the God of the Bible. The crucial paradigm of our Bible is the story of how God rescued a rabble of slaves, long before they had done anything to deserve to be chosen. They were not even an attractive lot, when God intervened decisively in their history. They were not even a nation. They were a raucous bunch, often at one another's throats, as when Moses had to intervene in a brotherly quarrel; they would have none of it and rejected his attempts at bring peace between them. Now there have been many, far more attractive people, far better organised, a great deal more worthy of being saved than this squabbling lot of Hebrew slaves. And that is the point of the story, they were not smart, or orderly, or friendly. They had nothing positive to commend them, and yet God chose them. Our God is that kind of God, who loves us not because we deserve it as something we have earned, nor because we are lovable. No, we get to be lovable only because God loves us*\"(In God's Hands, pg 47-48)\n\n\"*We blacks have been defined too often in the white man's terms: we are non-white, non-European--negatives. Language has a potent relationship to reality. From being thought of or spoken about as 'non-this' or 'non that' we end up being treated as nonentities. Maybe that is too strong. Well, we end up being treated as human but not quite human as the white man, or what amounts to the same thing, we are treated as inferior persons, not quite on the same level as those who deign to notice our existence. What is more serious is that we begin to think of ourselves in the way we have come to commonly described. We have now adopted the term 'black' quite deliberately so that we can describe ourselves positively. It is an assertion of our personhood, our identity in its own right, not merely over and against anybody else. We are declaring to ourselves or to anybody who cares to listen that we are fundamentally subjects not objects, persons not things. Each of us is a 'I' not an 'It'. We have to say this over and over again to 'unbrainwash' ourselves until we believe it and can act as if we really did believe in our own dignity and humanity. The trouble is that the white man has, up to now, perhaps unconsciously, yet certainly, sought to determine our existence. He has, as it were, drawn up the agenda for our lives. We have hitherto been playing a game whose rules have been determined by the white man and he has often even been the referee as well. So we use 'black' as an epithet here because we are black: because we are each somebody. We matter, we're alive and kicking and black is beautiful.*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 116-117)\n\n\"*The white man has quite arrogantly believed that his standards were of universal validity. This has not normally been asserted in so many words. No, it has been taken as part of the nature of things, too obvious to be declared. It has just been taken as read. This has included theological reflection and expression. This has included theological reflection and expression. We might get a spate of denials against this charge, but it remains true that political and economic power has given the white man considerable leverage to exercise cultural and intellectual neocolonialism even where there has been political decolonisation. By and large, what the West decides as counting for, say, academic excellence is academic excellence for the rest of the world. This has occurred in theology as well. Black theology is a repudiation of this Western arrogance. Black theology makes the proper assertion to which Anglo-Saxon theology at least pays lip service: that there can never be a final theology, for theology changes as various ingredients in mixture change--the life experience of the particular community, its self understanding, its manner and categories of expression.*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 117)\n\n\"*Black theology is an engaged theology, not an academic detached theology. It is a gut level theology, relating to the real concerns, life and death issues of the black man....Black theology seeks to make sense of the life experience of the black man, which is largely black suffering at the hands of rampant white racism, and to understand this in the light of what God has said about himself, about man, and about the world in his definitive Word. Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be a Christian; it is to ask on whose side is God; it is to be concerned about the humanisation of persons, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise themselves in the process; it is concerned with the liberation of all, black and white, since the liberation of the black man is the other side of the coin of the liberation of the white man. It is the clarion call for man to align himself with the God who is the God of Exodus, God the liberator, who leads his people, all his people, out of all kinds of bondage-political, economic, cultural; out of the bondage of sin and disease-into the glorious liberty of the sons of God*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 119)\n\n\"*Throughout most of the Old Testament, God showed that the nature of God was the same yesterday, today and forever. God had sided with the slaves in Egypt. Now, for instance, when the King of Israel wanted to do something not too outrageous but simply to consolidate the royal property, he offered to buy Naboth's vineyard which impeded that consolidation, or to give him another in exchange. Naboth rejected both offers and King Ahab knew that, in Israel, that was that: he could do nothing further it except sulk. His spouse, the non-Israelite Jezebel, did what she had seen happen so many times in her home country. An awkward customer was snuffed out and that should have been the end of the story, with King Ahab now able to confiscate the dead Naboth's vineyard for free. But not in Israel. God's prophet Elijah, confronted the king on behalf of a nonentity(Naboth was such a nonentity that his geneology is not even recorded in the story) and took the king thoroughly to task because God-our God-is tat kind of God, always biased in favour of the downtrodden, of the weak, of the despised; a God who is thoroughly biased and not even handed at all*\"(In God's Hands, pg 52-53)\n\n\"*God had longed for us to live in a paradise with friendly animals and a garden of plants that would have grown without too much back breaking toil, with not too many weeds to be uprooted. God had hoped we would dwell in this paradise, aware that we were family, with a God who was not too far away-a God who could figuratively drop by of an afternoon for a chat with God's creatures. Praying and worshipping would not have been, as is so often the case, drudgery. Praying would have been a matter of course, like two friends conversing without the bane of often debilitating distractions. Whatever it was that happened, it made communion with the Creator so often a draining slog. Whatever we may think of those stories of the beginning times, most of us will admit that they depict what many of us experience daily. We are aware that we know Paradise Lost. God had wanted us to be as a family. Tragically God's intention was frustrated: brother turned on brother and so Cain murdered Abel, a fratricide that has been echoed too many times. Nazi Germans turned on fellow Germans who happened to be Jews, and result was the Holocaust. Very recently one million Tutsis were assassinated by their Hutu fellow Rwandans.... The catalogue is endless and ghastly. And this is an account of only a very few of the atrocities being perpetrated today. It would be devastating if we described the blood-letting that has happened since homosapiens appeared on the scene, God's dream lying in tatters. God has not given up on God's dream. It has been kept alive by those whom God has sent to remind us of it. Just as Martin Luther King Jr famously proclaimed 'I have a Dream' in a deeply moving address in Washington DC, so God can keep reminding us, 'I have a dream that one day my people will know that I created them to be a family. I created them for togetherness*\"(In God's Hands, pg 109-110)\n\n\"*Friends, the leaders of our government have gone crazy. Maybe they did not know what they were really doing. Let me tell them something. I am not going to stop calling for the release of detainees in church and outside church, in a service or a gathering, because I believe it is part of my vocation as a Christian. And whatever the consequences, I urge the authorities to release all detainees or bring them to court immediately, and I hope you support me in such a call. Should the authorities arrest and charge me, when I return, I will again call for the release of detainees if there are still around. I will urge my congregations and others to be engaged in a campaign to do so peacefully and nonviolently, whatever the consequences for me. Let me warn the government yet again....you are not God. You may be powerful, perhaps even very powerful, but you are not God. You are mere mortals. Beware when you take on the church of God. Others have tried it before, ad they came a cropper. They bit the dust and did so ignominiously-the Roman Emperor Nero, Hitler, Amin and many others. You will end up being part of the flotsam and jetsam of history, hardly a footnote on the pages of history. Please hear our cry. Get rid of the monster of your creating, apartheid, and we will have a New South Africa-just, nonracial and demcoratic, where black and white will exist side by side amicably together in their home country as members of one family, the human family, God's family*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 155)\n\n\"*Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said 'Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all they heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, though shalt love they neighbor as thyself. For Jesus, love of God was inconceivable and could not exist without its corollary love of neighbor. One of the evangelists sums up the teaching of the Bible in this matter by asking 'How can you say you love God whom you have not seen if you hate your brother whom you have seen?'(1 John 4:20). What I am saying is that I am not a politician. It is not my politics that causes me to be involved in the sociopolitical arena. No, it is my Christian belief. It is because I too think I have had an encounter with Jesus Christ in prayer, in the Bible reading, and it is precisely this encounter which constrains me to say and to do things that I say and do. It is in obedience to the imperative of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to the commandment of God, and to the teaching of the Bible that I am involved in sociopolitical and economic matters. And for this I do not apologise at all. I reject all false dichotomies as between the sacred and the secular about things that are called religious and others that are merely secular. For me religion is concerned about all of life and not only about certain aspects of it. The God whom I worship is the Lord of all life. There is no aspect of human existence where his writ does not run. In a parable about the Last Judgement, Jesus Christ teaches that we will be judged about whether we are fit for heaven or hell by whether we did or did not do certain things. It is interesting that all these could not strictly be called religious: feeding the hungry, visiting the sick, clothing the naked, visiting prisoners in prison*.\"(God is not a Christian, pg 129-130)",

        "text": "As everyone knows Archbishop Desmond Tutu is the famous Anglican Archbishop of South Africa who was famous with Nelson Mandela in his struggle against apartheid in South Africa. He's actually one of my personal heroes along with MLK, and he actually played a role in my decision to explore and ultimately embrace Anglicanism. I'm going to do a part 1 and part 2 in terms of quotations from him. Here are a series of inspirational quotes from him on various social and spiritual topics:\n\n\"*God asks us to be co-creators with God, to be those who promote flourishing, not promoting death. We are being warned that it may be that we have only a few years left before the changes we are effecting through our uncaring and ruthless exploitation of natural resources become irreversible. WE are, we should remember, God's viceroys, God's stand-ins. We should bear rule as God's representatives. Greed is responsible for our uncaring depletion of fossil fuels, which belch forth the fumes that are destroying the ozone layer. God wanted us to live in a paradise. We are fast falling into a hell of our own making because of our uncaring exploitation*\"(In God's Hands, pg 17)\n\n\"*If we really believe what we asserted, that each human being without exception is created in the image of God and so is a God-carrier, then we would be appalled at any ill-treatment of another human being, because it is not simply unjust but also, shockingly, blasphemous. It really is like spitting in the face of God. That, in fact, is what the missionaries had brought us: this book that is more radical, more revolutionary than any political manifesto could hope to be*\"(In God's Hands, pg 21-22)\n\n\"*Yes, the Bible is subversion in its opposition to injustice, and I pray too that African governments and our Church in other African countries will end the horrendous injustice that the current homophobia has unleashed. It is not only unjust but totally un-Christian to penalize people for something about which they can do nothing. None of us choose our race, our gender, our sexual orientation. These are extrinsic to who we are: those extraordinary creatures made in the image of our Creator, endowed with an intrinsic worth that nothing can destroy. Imagine what our world would be like if we did regard one another as God-carriers of infinite worth! How could we mistreat, bomb or torture a fellow God-carrier?*\"(In God's Hands, pg 25)\n\n\"*We all know how difficult it is to say I am sorry. Those are some of the most difficult words in any language. I do not find it easy to say them, even in the privacy of our bedroom to my wife. We can imagine then what it must have meant to the perpetrators to have to confess publicly under the glare of television lights. Frequently the perpetrator had been a respected member of his community. This was often the first time even for his family to hear that this apparent paragon of virtue had in fact been a member of a police team that used torture on detainees routinely, or that he was a member of a death squad that assassinated as a matter of course those who were regarded as opponents of the vicious apartheid system. The stigma of such public shame and humiliation is a heavy price to have had to pay, and in some instances shocked spouses ended up divorcing their husbands. But in using this argument we should be in fact thinking only in terms of retributive justice, who's raison detre is to punish the perpetrator. There is another king of justice: restorative justice, whose chief purpose is not punitive but restorative, healing. It holds as central the essential humanity of the perpetrator of even the most gruesome atrocity, never giving up on anyone, believing in the essential goodness of all as created in the image of God, and believing that even the worst of us still remains a child of God with the potential to become better, someone salvaged*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 42)\n\n\"*Ubuntu(and so restorative justice) gives up on no one. No one is a totally hopeless and irredeemable case. We all, even the worst of us, remain the children of God. We all retain the capacity to become saints. For us as Christians, the paradigm was provided by our Lord and the penitent thief on the cross. The thief had led a life of crime presumably until he was crucified. Some might be appalled at his death bed repentance and conversion but not God, whom we seek to emulate. 'Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect(Matthew 5:48) is Jesus's exhortation. We are not able to declare categorically that So-and-So has a first class ticked to hell. We shall be surprised at those we meet in heaven whom we least expected to be there, and perhaps also by those we do not find there whom we had expected to be there*\"(God is not Christian, pg 44)\n\n\"*In many countries that are totalitarian or oppressive, the governments have certain literature which they ban. In South Africa many books are prohibited. We to the government of South Africa 'You are too late, because the book you should have banned long ago is the Bible, for that is the most revolutionary book in the situation of oppression. St Paul says each one of us is a temple of the Holy Spirit. To treat one such person as if they were less than this is not just wrong, it is blasphemous, and we don't get this from a political manifesto. We get it from the Bible. And we learn from the Bible that God is a God who takes sides. He is not neutral. God is a God who is always on the side of the poor, the oppressed, the little ones who are despised; and it is for that reason that we, his church, have got to be in solidarity with the poor, the homeless, the hungry and the oppressed. So my brothers and sisters, you are called to a high calling. You are to remind the church that whenever it is obedient to this Lord and Master, the church will end up, as its Lord and Master did, on the cross. Because when the church speaks on behalf of the weak and the poor, the powerful and rich don't like it and the church must suffer. A church that does not suffer is not the church of Jesus Christ*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 65)\n\n\"*Almost always the people were pulled up short. They thought somehow that they could as it were, bribe God by elaborate religious ritual, by observing strict religious laws and offering elaborate worship. And they were constantly being pulled up short whenever they were confronted by the bias of God and by God's real demands. They probably thought they just might hoodwink God if they did provide elaborate and perhaps costly ritual. Imagine what we would think if, on the occasion of a glorious celebration of the Eucharist in Canterbury Cathedral, with billows of incense smoke and the Archbishop of Canterbury and other worthies resplendent in their eucharistic robes, an untidy, unkempt man were to interrupt their elaborate ritual and shout vociferously that all of this performance was quite unacceptable to God; that it was an abomination to God; that God abhorred it all. To say the assembled worshippers would all be stunned is to put it very mildly...we would wonder where the security personnel had got to, and what they had been doing to allow such an awful spectacle to occur. Well, something of the sort did take place in the Jerusalem Temple when, in the middle of some elaborate worship, the prophet Isaiah strolled in and declared that all they were doing was an utter abomination to their God who rejected it all totally, unless it had made them as biased as the God they purported to be worshipping. For God rejected all that ostentatious ritualistic display. What God demanded was that God's people should have God's biased and be concerned for the plight of the widow, the orphan and the alien in their midst*\"(In God's Hands, pg 51-52)\n\n\"*The prophets were seething in their condemnation, especially of the ostentatious religious celebrations which went hand in glove with a rapacious disregard for the welfare of the poor, the hungry, the despised, the marginalised; all who were the flotsam and jetsam of their societies. They had no one to speak up for them, and it was Good who took the cudgels on their behalf. You can imagine the impact of this on people who had been used to being treated like scum. It was almost as if the Bible had been written with our particular struggle against apartheid in mind. And when the powerful in the land berated us for doing that most awful thing, mixing religion with politics we used to reply by asking 'Which Bible do you read?'. We would quote with happy abandon from the books of the prophets such as Amos, Jeremiah, Isaiah and others to show that real authentic religion was no exercise in escapism. No, it was earthy and thoroughly relevant to the business of human living*\"(In God's Hands, pg 54-55)\n\n\"*We who are freely loved and thus affirmed are meant to be as God to others, to seek to work for a world which has been preserved for the enjoyment of all. God longs that we, who are aware of our infinite worth, will see in one another the image of God and so recognise that each of us, whatever our gender, our sexual orientation, or our nationality, are fundamentally members of one family. The human family. God's family is created to exist in a delicate network of interdependence, one on another, so that we actualise our complementarity, aware of our need of one another; so that we embody ubuntu, that I am because you are, and you are because I am; that indeed a person is a person only through other persons*\"(In God's Hands, pg 97)\n\n\"*A student once asked me, if I could have one wish granted to reverse and injustice what would it be? I had to ask for two. One is for world leaders to forgive the debts of developing nations which holds them in such thrall. The other is for the world to end the persecution of people because of sexual orientation, which is every bit as unjust as that crime against humanity, apartheid. This is a matter of ordinary justice. We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by the people of the world, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer something we could do nothing about, our very skin. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. I could not have fought against the discrimination of apartheid and not also fight against the discrimination that homosexuals endure, even in our churches and faith groups*\"(God is not a Christian, pg 54)",

        "text": "While I think that the Biblical documents we have are reliable enough for knowing much about Jesus, I think the evidence for Jesus outside of the Bible is useful too. The pieces of evidence I display here claim the following about Jesus:\n\n1. **Jesus was an important person** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus). Josephus calls Jesus a \"*sophos aner,\"* which implies that Josephus thought of Jesus was an extremely important person. As Ulrich Victor [points out (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20697293?seq=1), this phrase commonly referred to men of very high importance in both Josephus' writings and outside of his writings in ancient Greek literature. People who are called σοφὸς ἀνήρ outside of Josephus' writings include people like Socrates (Plato, *Apol.* 18b:7), Plato (*Chion. Ep.* 5.1), along with Aesop, Solon, Thales, Xenocrates, Aristotle, Themistocles, Pindar, etc. If the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man\" is authentic, as I think, then not only does this imply that Josephus saw Jesus as an important man, but also an extraordinary one. However, as Victor argues, the phrase \"wise man\" (which is typically taken as authentic by scholars) was more exclusive than the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man.\" Mara-bar-Serapion also compares Jesus to Socrates and Pythagoras, both famous and important people in the ancient world.\n2. **Jesus was born in Judaea** (Celsus).\n3. **Jesus had a father named Joseph** (James Ossuary), or a Roman soldier named Pantera (Celsus). The latter is clearly reflective of Jewish polemic.\n4. **Jesus had a brother named James** (James Ossuary, Josephus).\n5. **Jesus spoke Aramaic** (James Ossuary). This is indicated by the fact that the inscription on the James Ossuary was written in Aramaic.\n6. **Jesus was poor** (Celsus).\n7. **Jesus went to Egypt out of poverty** (Celsus).\n8. **Jesus was wise** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus).\n9. **Jesus did miracles** (Josephus, Celsus). The early Mishnaic Sanhedrin 43a also attests to this. The words \"παραδόξων έργων\" (startling deeds), which are used in the TF, often refers to activity of divine/supernatural elements in Josephus' books (e.g., *Ant.* 2:223, 267, 285, 295, 345, 347; 3:1, 14, 30, 38; 5:28, 125; 6:171; 9.14, 58, 60, 182; 10:28, 235; 13:282; 15:379; *Ag. Ap*. 2:114). In addition, every person in Josephus' works that are called a \"wise man\" are also described as having supernatural powers.\n10. **Jesus was a teacher and a lawgiver** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus, Lucian of Samosata).\n11. **Jesus taught that all of his followers are \"brothers\"** (Lucian of Samosata).\n12. **Jesus claimed to be \"a god\"** (Celsus).\n13. **Jesus founded various rites** (Lucian of Samosata).\n14. **Jesus gained many followers that did not cease after the crucifixion** (Josephus, Tacitus).\n15. **Jesus was known as the Christ** (Josephus).\n16. **The Jewish authorities accused Jesus and handed Him over to Pilate** (Josephus). Mara bar-Serapion also attests to Jewish involvement.\n17. **Jesus was crucified by Pilate in Judaea during the reign of Tiberius** (Thallus, Josephus, Tacitus, Lucian of Samosata).\n18. **Jesus was peaceful:** While this isn't explicitly stated, it is demanded by the fact that Josephus and Tacitus say that Jesus was executed by Pilate, but not his followers, who rather continued to spread the message. This is because it was Roman law to execute the followers of a militant figure. John Granger Cook writes: \"However Pilate viewed the seriousness of Jesus’ *crimen*, he could not have viewed him as a truly dangerous fomenter of sedition, since he did not persecute his followers\" - Cook, \"[Crucifixion and Burial](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/new-testament-studies/article/crucifixion-and-burial/ABDE509ED99779E09AD59AC274E378A3),\" *NTS*, 2011, p. 203.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (1) The James Ossuary (62/63 C.E.)\n\n&gt;\"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\"\n\nThere has been huge controversy over the inscription on this ossuary. The ossuary itself is not a forgery, but many question the latter half of the inscription on the ossuary which references Jesus. The inscription says: \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\" Another large group of scholars think that this is authentic (or at least plausibly so) and refers to Jesus of Nazareth. The reader may be interested in a scholarly [piece here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Saxa_judaica_loquuntur_Lessons_from_Earl/XI8cBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=james+ossuary+inscription+authentic&amp;pg=PA77&amp;printsec=frontcover) by Pieter W. van der Horst (Leiden: Brill, 2014) which I think offers very valid critiques against the apparently biased decision of many of the members of the IAA, who ruled the inscription on the ossuary as forged or redacted. Some also doubt whether the reference to Jesus being the father of Joseph and the brother of James is specific enough to conclude that the ossuary is James the Just's, since Jesus, James, and Joseph were all common names at the time. However, the fact that the inscription specifies that James was the brother of Jesus indicates that this Jesus was an important figure. Only one other ossuary from the ancient world ever studied mentions the brother of the deceased.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (2) Mara bar-Serapion (~73 C.E.)\n\n&gt;What advantage did the Athenians gain by murdering Socrates, for which they were repaid with famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, because their country was completely covered in sand in just one hour? Or the Jews by killing their wise king, because their kingdom was taken away at that very time? God justly repaid the wisdom of these three men: the Athenians died of famine; the Samians were completely overwhelmed by the sea; and the Jews, desolate and driven from their own kingdom, are scattered through every nation. Socrates is not dead, because of Plato; neither is Pythagoras, because of the statue of Juno; nor is the wise king, because of the new laws he laid down.\"\n\nMara Bar-Serapion, a non-Christian Syriac philosopher, probably had knowledge of Jesus, who, if so, is labeled as the \"wise king.\" Serapion compares this wise king to Socrates and Pythagoras, so no bloke, that's for sure. Mara Bar-Serapion says that the wise king was killed unjustly by \"the Jews,\" and that the 'wise king' lived on *because* of his *new* teachings. Serapion also links the 'wise kings' death with the Jewish war. Thus, he is likely partially or fully dependent on Christian thought. In my opinion, Serapion would likely date in the 70s C.E., though there is disagreement in scholarship, with some scholars dating it later. Most scholars support the early dating in the 70s C.E., however (e.g., Ilaria Ramelli; Michael Blomer; David Rensberger; Annette Merz; Teun L. Tieleman; Ephrem-Isa yousif; Gerd Theissen; Fergus Millar; Craig A. Evans). The fact that the author of this letter was not Christian (he speaks openly about \"our gods,\" for example) is significant, since he gives his non-believing opinion that Jesus was an important figure. He is also independent of the Gospel stories if he dates in the 70s C.E.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (3) Josephus (93 C.E.)\n\n&gt;About this time there comes Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it is right to call him a man. For he was a doer of startling deeds and was a teacher of such people that receive the true things with pleasure. He won over many Jews, but also many of the Greek element. *He was \\[\"called\" or \"known as\"?\\] the Christ*. When Pilate, at the accusation of the principal men among us, had condemned him to a cross, those who had in the first place come to love him did not cease doing so. *For he appeared to them having a third day living again, for the divine prophets had foretold these and countless other marvelous things about him.* And the tribe of the Christians, so called after this fellow, has still to this day not disappeared. (*Antiquities* 18:63-64)\n\nIn this post, I will not include the italicized phrases in the text cited above (even though I think they all could be original). Bart Ehrman says that \"most scholars\" think Josephus originally said something like what the un-italicized portion of the text says (see his blog post [here 2019)](https://ehrmanblog.org/do-any-ancient-jewish-sources-mention-jesus-weekly-mailbag/), though I will more and more experts are thinking that the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man\" is authentic. Now for the reference to Jesus in book 20:\n\n&gt;“Ananus . . . assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others. And, when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.\" (*Antiquities* 20:200).\n\n(i) *Arguments Against the Whole-Sale Invention of the TF.*\n\nFirst, the episode of John the Baptist has no obvious connection with the TF. John appears to be an independent person in Josephus, unlike in early Christian theology. The John episode also awkwardly appears *after* the TF in *Ant.* 18., whereas John's ministry is before Jesus' in early Christian theology (such as in Eusebius' quotation of Josephus). This all points to an original Jesus *and* John passage. Second, if a Christian editor was as audacious as to forge an entire paragraph, it would have probably been much longer and elaborate. And compared with any Christian text of the second to fifth centuries, it is for the most part very bland. Nothing about son of God or coming from God, pre-existence, Trinitarianism, Holy Spirit, atonement, being in Christ, shed blood, gone to heaven, about to return in the clouds, reluctance of Pilate, etc. etc. The only real puzzles are the Christ and the resurrection sentence. Third, the language used in most of the TF is very specific to Josephus, and at times uses language that was considered negative by Christians. Ken Olson however has recently tried to reignite the hypothesis that Eusebius forged the entire TF, since he is the first to quote it, and adopts much of Josephus' language. but Sabrina Inowlocki writes that \"this has not found support among scholars\" - Inowlocki, “Josephus and Patristic Literature,” in *A Companion to Josephus*, Wiley Blackwell 2016, p. 359. Alice Whealey likewise says that \"the overall thesis of fabrication by Eusebius has not been generally accepted in the scholarship\" - Whealey, \"The Testimonium Flavianum,\" in *A Companion to Josephus*, p. 352. See Alice Whealey's essay in the book called *Josephus und das Neue Testament* (Mohr Siebeck, 2007) for convincing arguments against Eusebius inventing the TF. Fourth, the reference to Jesus in Ant. 20.200 probably presupposes a Jesus reference earlier in *Antiquities*. Steve Mason argues:\n\n&gt;\"The order of his identifiers suggests that he chooses James as representative of the condemned group because he is ‘the brother of the one called \\[or known as\\] Christos’, already known to the audience. James’ name comes as an afterthought. This formulation suggests, therefore, that Josephus has mentioned someone ‘known as Christos’, recently enough for his audience might remember. The only plausible candidate is Jesus in Book 18.\" (Mason, \"Sources that Mention Jesus from Outside the Circles of Christ-Followers,\" *Jesus-Handbuch (ish)*, 2017, p. 12)\n\nSome try and relate Ant. 20:200 to Jesus ben Damneus, but the Greek in 20:203 is constructed in such a way as to introduce this figure to his audience. In addition, as TimO'Neill points out [here](https://historyforatheists.com/2018/02/jesus-mythicism-2-james-the-brother-of-the-lord/), this view entails that Josephus employs appellations to both Jesus' in a way he does nowhere else. Alice Whealey writes that the authenticity of the Jesus reference in Ant. 20.200 is \"accepted by most contemporary scholars\" - Whealey, \"The Testimonium Flavianum,\" in *A Companion to Josephus*, 2016, p. 353.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(ii) *Josephus' Source of Information.*\n\nIf anyone has the greatest chance at having heard of Christians and Jesus from outside Christian sources, surely it is Josephus of Jerusalem. Josephus was born around 37 C.E., shortly after Jesus' death. Gary J. Goldberg [points out (2021, pp. 32)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356256381_Josephus's_Paraphrase_Style_and_the_Testimonium_Flavianum) that Josephus notes in *Vita*, 9 how he grew up in Jerusalem with \"principal men\" which Josephus mentions in the *Testimonium*, who would have chiefly been 30-60 years old (some younger, some older). These men Josephus grew up with are who Josephus got his information regarding pre-70 Judaism from and are thus a possible source of information for Jesus and indeed for the other first century Jewish preachers. Supporting this is the mention the principal men that Josephus says handed Jesus over to Pilate is said to come from \"among us,\" since Goldberg points out in his 2021 article (pp. 19) that: \"in historical narrative, Josephus takes care to write in the third person.\" But here he doesn't. He combines \"principal men\" with \"among us,\" which he does nowhere else. If Josephus just wanted to say the \"principal men among us\" to mean that these principal men came among us in the sense of being Jewish people of his own class, Josephus could have used his more typical phrase seen in e.g., *Ant.* 14.165 (\"the principal ones of the Judaeans\"). *This all may imply that Josephus knew at least some of these people who are said to hand Jesus over to Pilate.* It is also possible that he heard about Jesus from Ananus II or the Jewish leaders related to James’ death in the early 60s when Josephus himself was in Jerusalem. Ananus II was the son of Ananus, who interrogated Jesus (John 18:13-14).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (4) Tacitus (~115 C.E.)\n\n&gt;Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. (*Annals* 15:44)\n\nTacitus was a Roman historian and is typically considered one of the most reliable and careful ancient historians of the period by modern historians. He is probably reliable in what he writes, especially if he is independent from Christians. Tacitus reports that Jesus (a) was crucified by Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius, (b) was the founder of the Christian sect in Judaea, and (3) had followers who spread Christianity even further after Jesus' death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Tacitus: Independent Information?*\n\nFor one, Tacitus thought of Christians as “a most mischievous superstition ... evil ... hideous and shameful.\" This does not seem like words one would expect from someone willing to accept information from Christians, whether directly or indirectly. This is especially since Tacitus disliked hearsay stemming from street gossip and the \"popular report\" (see *Annals* 4:11), which Tacitus would have considered Christians surely. Moreover, nothing in Tacitus' passage suggests as Christian source, since he makes no mention of anything that indicates a purely Christian origin. Pliny, on the other hand, in reporting what *Christians* said, mentions hymns sung to Jesus \"as to a god.\" There is actually a more likely source of information that Tacitus got his information about Jesus from: the aristocratic Jewish exiles who were in Flavian court as he was. This included Princess Berenice, the daughter of Herod Agrippa. One has to keep in mind that the Jesus Sect began in Galilee, and Tacitus was at court with the daughter of the Herod Agrippa of Galilee who was a contemporary of Jesus and tetrarch of Galilee shortly after Jesus' death. Someone like her would have been more keenly accepted by Tacitus, since she was much closer to his class, was not despised (unlike Christians), and would have had relevant information on Jesus from reliable sources.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (5) Lucian of Samosata (~165 C.E.)\n\n&gt;\"... the man who was crucified in Palestine because he introduced this new cult into the world. (Lucian of Samosata, The Passing of Peregrinus, 11)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day—the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account \\[text breaks off\\] … You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.\" (Lucian of Samosata, The Passing of Peregrinus, 13)\n\nLucian of Samosata was a Syrian satirist who briefly references Jesus. It is possible that Lucian of Samosata provides us with an independent tradition regarding Jesus's crucifixion, since he uses a word to describe the crucifixion with a Greek word that ancient Christians are never documented as using (\"stauroun\" = \"impaled\") for the crucifixion of Jesus. Plus, Lucian detested Christians, and so probably may have been less keen on accepting their information. Finally, Lucian isn't entirely accurate in his representation of Christian practices, which may suggest that he didn't interact much with Christians. Scholars like Craig Evans and Paul Eddy support Lucian of Samosata relaying a tradition of Jesus' crucifixion independent to that of Christians. Nevertheless, writers like Tacitus and Lucian show that Jesus' crucifixion was an accepted fact by Romans in the second century. Lucian also records Jesus being the originator of many of the Christian rites, as well as being a teacher or lawgiver. Lucian also seems to imply that the \"crucified sage\" was considered important (\"distinguished personage\").\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (6) Celsus (~175 C.E.)\n\n&gt;Jesus had come from a village in Judea, and was the son of a poor Jewess who gained her living by the work of her own hands. His mother had been turned out of doors by her husband, who was a carpenter by trade, on being convicted of adultery with a soldier named Pantera. Being thus driven away by her husband, and wandering about in disgrace, she gave birth to Jesus, a bastard. Jesus, on account of his poverty, was hired out to go to Egypt. While there he acquired certain (magical) powers which Egyptians pride themselves on possessing. He returned home highly elated at possessing these powers, and on the strength of them gave himself out to be a god. (Origen, *Contra Celsum* 1.28)\n\nCelsus was a second century Roman philosopher and critic of Christianity. The books criticizing Christianity from Celsus is lost and quoted by Origen, who wishes to try and debate Celsus. While Celsus knows much about the Christian story from Christian literature, the evidence suggests that he is also relying on ancient Jewish tradition. Origen even explicitly says that Celsus is relying on Jewish polemic. Second, what Celsus says parallels ancient second century (or earlier) Jewish polemic in reflected in Tosefta 2:22-23, where people in Galilee are scolded for healing in the name of \"Jesus son of Pantera\" ([Tosefta 2:22-23](https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Chullin.2.6?lang=bi)). As in Celsus, there is a tradition that Jesus was born of a person named Pantera. Adolf Deissmann showed in 1906 that \"Pantera\" was a surname for Roman soldiers in particular, and later Talmudic sources from the early fourth century CE show that ancient Jewish people were claiming that Jesus was born from a Roman soldier named Pantera explicitly. As for historical datums of Jesus, he attests to a lot. The major question is whether the earlier Jewish polemical source reflected by Celsus and the Tosefta is wholly reliant upon Christian information, which is ambiguous. That seems unlikely, however. One also cannot accept on face value many of the points made in this account of Jesus, since it is polemic. However, Celsus seems to be working off of core facts here which could have been relayed to him by his earlier Jewish source.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Honorable Mentions and Possible Sources\n\n**Thallus (49-52 C.E).** Dale C. Allison Jr. writes: \"Thallus was a pagan or Samaritan historian who wrote a history of the eastern Mediterranean world from before the Trojan War to his own day, which was the middle or latter part of the first century C.E. His work, composed in Greek, has perished and is known only through mention in later writers. Among these is the ninth-century Byzantine historian George Syncellus who, in a quotation from another lost history, that of the early third century Christian Julius Africanus, refers to Thallus' words about the darkness that accompanied the death of Jesus (cf. Matt 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44) . . . Yet the fact that the latter states his disagreement with Thallus' interpretation—\"This, it seems to me, is contrary to reason\"—strongly implies that Thallus was offering a mundane explanation for what had happened when Jesus died\" - Dale C. Allison Jr., \"Thallus on the Crucifixion,\" in *The Historical Jesus in Context* (Princeton University Press, 2006), pp. 405-406. There are several counterarguments against Thallus having originally mentioned Jesus, so this reference is not certain. In short though, I think the way Julius Africanus/George Syncellus responds negatively tips the scales in my direction. Benjamin Garstad puts it this way: \"There has been unwarranted doubt as to whether or not Thallos actually wrote about the Crucifixion or merely an eclipse . . . If Thallos had not connected the darkness at the Crucifixion to an eclipse, he would not have been censured by Synkellos for explaining a miraculous sign as a natural event\" - Benjamin Garstad, ‘Thallos’ in *Brill’s New Jacoby*, Ed. Ian Worthington et al., Brill Academic Publishers, 2007.\n\n**Pliny the Younger (111 C.E.).** Pliny the Younger wrote a letter to the Roman emperor Trajan. Pliny is relying upon Christian information here (but not the Gospels), and he confirms that early Christians worshipped \"Christ\" as \"a god.\" Pliny also gives us information as to how these ancient Christians he encountered in Bithynia worshipped before the writing of this letter. He does not give any information about the historical Jesus though aside from his existence, and so is not included.\n\n**Suetonius (119-122 C.E.).** See John Granger Cook, \"Chrestiani, Christiani, Χριστιανοί: a Second Century Anachronism?,\" *Vigiliae* *Christianae*, 2020, p. 253 for a recent defense of Suetonius having mentioned Jesus of Nazareth. Chrestus was a common misspelling of ‘Christus’ as the substitution for ‘e’ for ‘i’ was a common itacistic error. For example, the original hand of Codex Sinaiticus has the spelling (Chrestianos) in the three NT of the term ‘Christian’ (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16). However, Suetonius may imply that 'Chrestus' was in Rome in the late 40s CE, which wouldn't fit. Then again, if Irenaeus could claim that Christ was crucified during Claudius’s imperium, maybe this mistake is forgivable. If Suetonius attests to Jesus' existence, he also attests to the presence of a Christian populace influential enough to cause the Jewish people to cause instigations and be kicked out in the city of Rome in the 40s C.E. Things are not certain though. While many NT scholars think Suetonius does have Jesus of Nazareth in mind, some classical historians disagree with this view. Since he doesn't provide any evidence of the historical Jesus aside from his existence, he is not included. One can read the Suetonius passage [here](https://lexundria.com/suet_cl/25/r) [(](https://lexundria.com/suet_cl/25/r)*The Life of Claudius*, 25:4).\n\n**Galen (176-192 C.E.).** Galenus was a well-known Greek physician who writes about Jesus in 176-180 or around 190 C.E. His passages of Jesus and Christians can be found here = [Galen (earlychristianwritings.com)](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html). Since Galen may have written about Jesus slightly beyond the 150-year timeframe, he is not added in the main list.\n\n**Sanhedrin 43a (&lt;200 C.E.).** This account of the trial of Jesus before Jewish leaders is one of the earliest references to Jesus in the Mishnah. While the Mishnah was codified just beyond the 150-year time frame (hence the account is not included in the main list), many scholars think that this account is based on an earlier source that does date within the 150-year time frame, with varying dates given. That this account in the Mishnah is based on an earlier independent source is a real possibility.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \"Contemporary or shut up!\"\n\nThat these documents were not contemporary and therefore are not reliable is a non-sequitur. It doesn't necessarily follow. The \"it must be contemporary\" rule is not used by any contemporary credentialed historian of today. Of course, such sources are preferable, but most documents in the ancient world were not contemporary to the events recorded in them. Such people or events were the exceptions, not the rule. For example, the first written source attesting to the existence of king Archelaus of Cappadocia is Josephus in his book *Jewish War*, around 60 years after his death. If we want to dismiss the later references to Jesus at the end of the century and in the next, do we do this with all ancient sources that are not contemporary? Markus Bockmuehl argues in his book *Seeing the Word: Refocusing New Testament Study* that the date of a source doesn't necessarily become a serious problem for the core of the story until we are 150+ years out from the events. Indeed, the 100–150-year timeframe after an event is when 'living memory' ends (e.g., when people who knew eyewitnesses typically all die out). Hence the time frame used here.",

The River Saraswati (PraU1.6) has a tributary named Ghaggar, reflective of the name of Sarah’s maidservant, Hagar. Sarah from Hebrew  (שרר *sharar*) means ruler and / or retains water. \n\nBrahma and Sarasvati lived together for 100 years, then had their first son, while Abraham was 100 and Sarah was 90 when they had Isaac (Gen 21.5). \n\nBrahma’s son (or grandson), Daksha, is killed as the offering sacrifice before all the gods, while Abraham almost offers his son Isaac. At the pleading of his father, Brihaspati (born from Brahma’s body, RV3.23.1) Daksha is resurrected with the head of a ram, while Abraham finds a ram caught in a bush to sacrifice in place of his son Isaac (Gen 22:1-13). Brahma’s hidden offering (AV19.42.1-2), relates to Abraham’s offering of a ram caught in a bush. \n\nThere are many more overlaps. But it's not just textual similarities. Aristotle says “Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country they inhabit, which is called Judea.” (Book I:22.)  Further,  Megasthenes, an ambassador of Seleucus I of Syria to India, in 288BC wrote in his book Indika that the Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called Kalani.\n\nIt is quite possble and often speculated that some Jewish ancestors were of the preistly class of Brahmans that headed west, bringing with them writing abilities. \n\nJust something fun for ya'll to read and have a think about instead of another \"God can't be real if he's evil\" post.",

        "text": "While I think that the Biblical documents we have are reliable enough for knowing much about Jesus, I think there are five accounts of Jesus we have outside of the Bible within 150 years of the crucifixion that are useful too. The accounts I display here claim the following about Jesus:\n\n1. **Jesus was an important person** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus). Josephus calls Jesus a \"*sophos aner,\"* which implies that Josephus thought of Jesus was an extremely important person. As Ulrich Victor [points out (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20697293?seq=1), this phrase commonly referred to men of very high importance in both Josephus' writings and outside of his writings. People who are called σοφὸς ἀνήρ outside of Josephus' writings include people like Socrates (Plato, *Apol.* 18b:7), Plato (*Chion. Ep.* 5.1), along with Aesop, Solon, Thales, Xenocrates, Aristotle, Themistocles, Pindar, etc. If the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man\" is authentic, as I think, then not only does this imply that Josephus saw Jesus as an important man, but also an extraordinary one. In fact, as Victor argues, the phrase \"wise man\" (which is typically taken as authentic by scholars) was more exclusive than the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man.\" Mara-bar-Serapion compares Jesus to Socrates and Pythagoras, both famous and important people in the ancient world.\n2. **Jesus was wise** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus).\n3. **Jesus was born in Judaea** (Celsus).\n4. **Jesus was poor** (Celsus).\n5. **Jesus went to Egypt out of poverty** (Celsus).\n6. **Jesus gained many followers that did not cease after the crucifixion** (Josephus, Tacitus).\n7. **Jesus did miracles** (Josephus, Celsus). The early Mishnaic Sanhedrin 43a also attests to this. The words \"παραδόξων έργων\" (startling deeds), which are used in the TF, often refers to activity of divine/supernatural elements in Josephus' books (e.g., *Ant.* 2:223, 267, 285, 295, 345, 347; 3:1, 14, 30, 38; 5:28, 125; 6:171; 9.14, 58, 60, 182; 10:28, 235; 13:282; 15:379; *Ag. Ap*. 2:114). In addition, every person in Josephus' works that are called a \"wise man\" are also described as having supernatural powers.\n8. **Jesus was a teacher and a lawgiver** (Mara bar-Serapion, Josephus, Lucian of Samosata).\n9. **Jesus taught that all of his followers are \"brothers\"** (Lucian of Samosata).\n10. **Jesus claimed to be \"a god\"** (Celsus).\n11. **Jesus had a brother named James** (Josephus).\n12. **Founded various rites** (Lucian of Samosata).\n13. **Jesus was known as the Christ** (Josephus).\n14. **The Jewish authorities accused Jesus and handed Him over to Pilate** (Josephus).\n15. **Jesus was crucified by Pilate in Judaea during the reign of Tiberius** (Josephus, Tacitus, Lucian of Samosata).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (1) Mara bar-Serapion (~73-80 C.E.)\n\n&gt;What advantage did the Athenians gain by murdering Socrates, for which they were repaid with famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, because their country was completely covered in sand in just one hour? Or the Jews by killing their wise king, because their kingdom was taken away at that very time? God justly repaid the wisdom of these three men: the Athenians died of famine; the Samians were completely overwhelmed by the sea; and the Jews, desolate and driven from their own kingdom, are scattered through every nation. Socrates is not dead, because of Plato; neither is Pythagoras, because of the statue of Juno; nor is the wise king, because of the new laws he laid down.\"\n\nMara Bar-Serapion, a non-Christian Syriac philosopher, probably had knowledge of Jesus, who, if so, is labeled as the \"wise king.\" Serapion compares this wise king to Socrates and Pythagoras, so no bloke, that's for sure. Mara Bar-Serapion says that the wise king was killed unjustly by \"the Jews,\" and that the 'wise king' lived on *because* of his *new* teachings. Serapion also links the 'wise kings' death with the Jewish war. Thus, he is likely partially or fully dependent on Christian thought. In my opinion, Serapion would likely date in the 70s C.E., though there is disagreement in scholarship, with some scholars dating it later. Most scholars support the early dating in the 70s C.E., however (e.g., Ilaria Ramelli; Michael Blomer; David Rensberger; Annette Merz; Teun L. Tieleman; Ephrem-Isa yousif; Gerd Theissen; Fergus Millar; Craig A. Evans). Given the fact that the author of this letter was not Christian (he speaks openly about \"our gods,\" for example) is significant, since he gives his non-believing opinion that Jesus was an important figure. He is also independent of the Gospel stories if he dates in the 70s C.E.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (2) Josephus (93 C.E.)\n\n&gt;About this time there comes Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it is right to call him a man. For he was a doer of startling deeds and was a teacher of such people that receive the true things with pleasure. He won over many Jews, but also many of the Greek element. *He was \\[\"called\" or \"known as\"?\\] the Christ*. When Pilate, at the accusation of the principal men among us, had condemned him to a cross, those who had in the first place come to love him did not cease doing so. *For he appeared to them having a third day living again, for the divine prophets had foretold these and countless other marvelous things about him.* And the tribe of the Christians, so called after this fellow, has still to this day not disappeared. (*Antiquities* 18:63-64)\n\nIn this post, I will not include the italicized phrases in the text cited above (even though I think they all could be original). Bart Ehrman says that \"most scholars\" think Josephus originally said something like what the un-italicized portion of the text says (see his blog post [here 2019)](https://ehrmanblog.org/do-any-ancient-jewish-sources-mention-jesus-weekly-mailbag/), though I will more and more experts are thinking that the phrase \"if indeed it is right to call him a man\" is authentic. Now for the reference to Jesus in book 20:\n\n&gt;“Ananus . . . assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others. And, when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.\" (*Antiquities* 20:200).\n\n(i) *Arguments Against the Whole-Sale Invention of the TF.*\n\nFirst, the episode of John the Baptist has no obvious connection with the TF. John appears to be an independent person in Josephus, unlike in early Christian theology. The John episode also awkwardly appears *after* the TF in *Ant.* 18., whereas John's ministry is before Jesus' in early Christian theology (such as in Eusebius' quotation of Josephus). This all points to an original Jesus *and* John passage. Second, if a Christian editor was as audacious as to forge an entire paragraph, it would have probably been much longer and elaborate. And compared with any Christian text of the second to fifth centuries, it is for the most part very bland. Nothing about son of God or coming from God, pre-existence, Trinitarianism, Holy Spirit, atonement, being in Christ, shed blood, gone to heaven, about to return in the clouds, reluctance of Pilate, etc. etc. The only real puzzles are the Christ and the resurrection sentence. Third, the language used in most of the TF is very specific to Josephus, and at times uses language that was considered negative by Christians. Ken Olson however has recently tried to reignite the hypothesis that Eusebius forged the entire TF, since he is the first to quote it, and adopts much of Josephus' language. but Sabrina Inowlocki writes that \"this has not found support among scholars\" - Inowlocki, “Josephus and Patristic Literature,” in *A Companion to Josephus*, Wiley Blackwell 2016, p. 359. Alice Whealey likewise says that \"the overall thesis of fabrication by Eusebius has not been generally accepted in the scholarship\" - Whealey, \"The Testimonium Flavianum,\" in *A Companion to Josephus*, p. 352. See Alice Whealey's essay in the book called *Josephus und das Neue Testament* (Mohr Siebeck, 2007) for convincing arguments against Eusebius inventing the TF. Fourth, the reference to Jesus in Ant. 20.200 probably presupposes a Jesus reference earlier in *Antiquities*. Steve Mason argues:\n\n&gt;\"The order of his identifiers suggests that he chooses James as representative of the condemned group because he is ‘the brother of the one called \\[or known as\\] Christos’, already known to the audience. James’ name comes as an afterthought. This formulation suggests, therefore, that Josephus has mentioned someone ‘known as Christos’, recently enough for his audience might remember. The only plausible candidate is Jesus in Book 18.\" (Mason, \"Sources that Mention Jesus from Outside the Circles of Christ-Followers,\" *Jesus-Handbuch (ish)*, 2017, p. 12)\n\nSome try and relate Ant. 20:200 to Jesus ben Damneus, but the Greek in 20:203 is constructed in such a way as to introduce this figure to his audience. In addition, as TimO'Neill points out [here](https://historyforatheists.com/2018/02/jesus-mythicism-2-james-the-brother-of-the-lord/), this view entails that Josephus employs appellations to both Jesus' in a way he does nowhere else. Alice Whealey writes that the authenticity of the Jesus reference in Ant. 20.200 is \"accepted by most contemporary scholars\" - Whealey, \"The Testimonium Flavianum,\" in *A Companion to Josephus*, 2016, p. 353.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(ii) *Josephus' Source of Information.*\n\nIf anyone has the greatest chance at having heard of Christians and Jesus from outside Christian sources, surely it is Josephus of Jerusalem. Josephus was born around 37 C.E., shortly after Jesus' death. Gary J. Goldberg [points out (2021, pp. 32)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356256381_Josephus's_Paraphrase_Style_and_the_Testimonium_Flavianum) that Josephus notes in *Vita*, 9 how he grew up in Jerusalem with \"principal men\" which Josephus mentions in the *Testimonium*, who would have chiefly been 30-60 years old (some younger, some older). These men Josephus grew up with are who Josephus got his information regarding pre-70 Judaism from and are thus a possible source of information for Jesus and indeed for the other first century Jewish preachers. Supporting this is the mention the principal men that Josephus says handed Jesus over to Pilate is said to come from \"among us,\" since Goldberg points out in his 2021 article (pp. 19) that: \"in historical narrative, Josephus takes care to write in the third person.\" But here he doesn't. He combines \"principal men\" with \"among us,\" which he does nowhere else. If Josephus just wanted to say the \"principal men among us\" to mean that these principal men came among us in the sense of being Jewish people of his own class, Josephus could have used his more typical phrase seen in e.g., *Ant.* 14.165 (\"the principal ones of the Judaeans\"). *This all may imply that Josephus knew at least some of these people who are said to hand Jesus over to Pilate.* It is also possible that he heard about Jesus from Ananus II or the Jewish leaders related to James’ death in the early 60s when Josephus himself was in Jerusalem. Ananus II was the son of Ananus, who interrogated Jesus (John 18:13-14).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (3) Tacitus (~115 C.E.)\n\n&gt;Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. (*Annals* 15:44)\n\nTacitus was a Roman historian and is typically considered one of the most reliable and careful ancient historians of the period by modern historians. He is probably reliable in what he writes, especially if he is independent from Christians. Tacitus reports that Jesus (a) was crucified by Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius, (b) was the founder of the Christian sect in Judaea, and (3) had followers who spread Christianity even further after Jesus' death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Tacitus: Independent Information?*\n\nFor one, Tacitus thought of Christians as “a most mischievous superstition ... evil ... hideous and shameful.\" This does not seem like words one would expect from someone willing to accept information from Christians, whether directly or indirectly. This is especially since Tacitus disliked hearsay stemming from street gossip and the \"popular report\" (see *Annals* 4:11), which Tacitus would have considered Christians surely. Moreover, nothing in Tacitus' passage suggests as Christian source, since he makes no mention of anything that indicates a purely Christian origin. Pliny, on the other hand, in reporting what *Christians* said, mentions hymns sung to Jesus \"as to a god.\" There is actually a more likely source of information that Tacitus got his information about Jesus from: the aristocratic Jewish exiles who were in Flavian court as he was. This included Princess Berenice, the daughter of Herod Agrippa. One has to keep in mind that the Jesus Sect began in Galilee, and Tacitus was at court with the daughter of the Herod Agrippa of Galilee who was a contemporary of Jesus and tetrarch of Galilee shortly after Jesus' death. Someone like her would have been more keenly accepted by Tacitus, since she was much closer to his class, was not despised (unlike Christians), and would have had relevant information on Jesus from reliable sources.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (4) Lucian of Samosata (~165 C.E.)\n\n&gt;\"... the man who was crucified in Palestine because he introduced this new cult into the world. (Lucian of Samosata, The Passing of Peregrinus, 11)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day—the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account \\[text breaks off\\] … You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.\" (Lucian of Samosata, The Passing of Peregrinus, 13)\n\nLucian of Samosata was a Syrian satirist who briefly references Jesus. It is possible that Lucian of Samosata provides us with an independent tradition regarding Jesus's crucifixion, since he uses a word to describe the crucifixion with a Greek word that ancient Christians are never documented as using (\"stauroun\" = \"impaled\") for the crucifixion of Jesus. Plus, Lucian detested Christians, and so probably may have been less keen on accepting their information. Finally, Lucian isn't entirely accurate in his representation of Christian practices, which may suggest that he didn't interact much with Christians. Scholars like Craig Evans and Paul Eddy support Lucian of Samosata relaying a tradition of Jesus' crucifixion independent to that of Christians. Nevertheless, writers like Tacitus and Lucian show that Jesus' crucifixion was an accepted fact by Romans in the second century. Lucian also records Jesus being the originator of many of the Christian rites, as well as being a teacher or lawgiver. Lucian also seems to imply that the \"crucified sage\" was considered important (\"distinguished personage\").\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# (5) Celsus (~175 C.E.)\n\n&gt;Jesus had come from a village in Judea, and was the son of a poor Jewess who gained her living by the work of her own hands. His mother had been turned out of doors by her husband, who was a carpenter by trade, on being convicted of adultery with a soldier named Pantera. Being thus driven away by her husband, and wandering about in disgrace, she gave birth to Jesus, a bastard. Jesus, on account of his poverty, was hired out to go to Egypt. While there he acquired certain (magical) powers which Egyptians pride themselves on possessing. He returned home highly elated at possessing these powers, and on the strength of them gave himself out to be a god. (Origen, *Contra Celsum* 1.28)\n\nCelsus was a second century Roman philosopher and critic of Christianity. The books criticizing Christianity from Celsus is lost and quoted by Origen, who wishes to try and debate Celsus. While Celsus knows much about the Christian story from Christian literature, the evidence suggests that he is also relying on ancient Jewish tradition. Origen even explicitly says that Celsus is relying on Jewish polemic. Second, what Celsus says parallels ancient second century (or earlier) Jewish polemic in reflected in Tosefta 2:22-23, where people in Galilee are scolded for healing in the name of \"Jesus son of Pantera\" ([Tosefta 2:22-23](https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Chullin.2.6?lang=bi)). As in Celsus, there is a tradition that Jesus was born of a person named Pantera. Adolf Deissmann showed in 1906 that \"Pantera\" was a surname for Roman soldiers in particular, and later Talmudic sources from the early fourth century CE show that ancient Jewish people were claiming that Jesus was born from a Roman soldier named Pantera explicitly. As for historical datums of Jesus, he attests to a lot. The major question is whether the earlier Jewish polemical source reflected by Celsus and the Tosefta is wholly reliant upon Christian information, which is ambiguous. That seems unlikely, however. One also cannot accept on face value many of the points made in this account of Jesus, since it is polemic. However, Celsus seems to be working off of core facts here which could have been relayed to him by his earlier Jewish source.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Honorable Sources and Potential Sources\n\n**Thallus (49-52 C.E.).** Dale C. Allison Jr. writes: \"Thallus was a pagan or Samaritan historian who wrote a history of the eastern Mediterranean world from before the Trojan War to his own day, which was the middle or latter part of the first century C.E. His work, composed in Greek, has perished and is known only through mention in later writers. Among these is the ninth-century Byzantine historian George Syncellus who, in a quotation from another lost history, that of the early third century Christian Julius Africanus, refers to Thallus' words about the darkness that accompanied the death of Jesus (cf. Matt 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44) . . . Yet the fact that the latter \\[Africanus\\] states his disagreement with Thallus' interpretation—\"This, it seems to me, is contrary to reason\"—strongly implies that Thallus was offering a mundane explanation for what had happened when Jesus died\" - Dale C. Allison Jr., \"Thallus on the Crucifixion,\" in *The Historical Jesus in Context* (Princeton University Press, 2006), pp. 405-406.  In short, the way Africanus/Syncellus responds negatively tips the scales towards authenticity. Benjamin Garstad puts it this way: \"There has been unwarranted doubt as to whether or not Thallos actually wrote about the Crucifixion or merely an eclipse . . . If Thallos had not connected the darkness at the Crucifixion to an eclipse, he would not have been censured by Synkellos for explaining a miraculous sign as a natural event\" - Garstad, ‘Thallos’ in *Brill’s New Jacoby*, Ed. Ian Worthington et al., Brill Academic Publishers, 2007. Even though Thallus probably wrote about Jesus, we do not have Thallus' words, and so he is not included in the main list.\n\n**The James Ossuary (62/63 C.E.).** There has been huge controversy over the inscription on this ossuary. The ossuary itself is not a forgery, but many question the latter half of the inscription on the ossuary which references Jesus. The inscription says: \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\" Many scholars think that this plausibly is authentic and refers to Jesus of Nazareth. The reader may be interested in a scholarly [piece here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Saxa_judaica_loquuntur_Lessons_from_Earl/XI8cBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=james+ossuary+inscription+authentic&amp;pg=PA77&amp;printsec=frontcover) by Pieter W. van der Horst (Leiden: Brill, 2014) which I think offers very valid critiques against the decision of many of the members of the IAA, who ruled the inscription on the ossuary as forged or redacted. Many also doubt whether the reference to Jesus being the father of Joseph and the brother of James is specific enough to conclude that the ossuary is James the Just's, since James and Joseph were both common names. It is thus too controversial to add to the list. Nevertheless, many scholars champion this as potential evidence for Jesus.\n\n**Pliny the Younger (111 C.E.).** Pliny the Younger wrote a letter to the Roman emperor Trajan. Pliny is relying upon Christian information here (but not the Gospels), and he confirms that early Christians worshipped \"Christ\" as a deity. Pliny also gives us information as to how these ancient Christians he encountered in Bithynia worshipped before the writing of this letter. He does not give any information about the historical Jesus though aside from his existence, and so is not included.\n\n**Suetonius (119-122 C.E.).** See John Granger Cook, \"Chrestiani, Christiani, Χριστιανοί: a Second Century Anachronism?,\" *Vigiliae* *Christianae*, 2020, p. 253 for a recent defense of Suetonius having mentioned Jesus of Nazareth. Chrestus was a common misspelling of ‘Christus’ as the substitution for ‘e’ for ‘i’ was a common itacistic error. For example, the original hand of Codex Sinaiticus has the spelling (Chrestianos) in the three NT of the term ‘Christian’ (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16). However, Suetonius may imply that 'Chrestus' was in Rome in the late 40s CE, which wouldn't fit. Then again, if Irenaeus could claim that Christ was crucified during Claudius’s imperium, maybe this mistake is forgivable. If Suetonius attests to Jesus' existence, he also attests to the presence of a Christian populace influential enough to cause the Jewish people to cause instigations and be kicked out in the city of Rome in the 40s C.E. Things are not certain though. While many NT scholars think Suetonius does have Jesus of Nazareth in mind, some classical historians disagree with this view. Since he doesn't provide any evidence of the historical Jesus aside from his existence, he is not included. One can read the Suetonius passage [here](https://lexundria.com/suet_cl/25/r) [(](https://lexundria.com/suet_cl/25/r)*The Life of Claudius*, 25:4).\n\n**Galen (176-192 C.E.).** Galenus was a well-known Greek physician who writes about Jesus in 176-180 or around 190 C.E. His accounts of Jesus and Christians can be found here = [Galen (earlychristianwritings.com)](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html). Since Galen may have written about Jesus slightly beyond the 150-year timeframe, he is not added in the main list.\n\n**Sanhedrin 43a (&lt;200 C.E.).** This account of the trial of Jesus before Jewish leaders is one of the earliest references to Jesus in the Mishnah. While the Mishnah was codified just beyond the 150-year time frame (hence the account is not included in the main list), many scholars think that this account is based on an earlier source that does date within the 150-year time frame, with varying dates given. That this account in the Mishnah is based on an earlier independent source is a real possibility.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThat these documents were not contemporary and therefore are not reliable is a non-sequitur. The \"it must be contemporary\" rule is not used by any contemporary credentialed historian of today. Of course, such sources are preferable, but most documents in the ancient world were not contemporary to the events recorded in them. Such people or events were the exceptions, not the rule. For example, the first written source attesting to the existence of king Archelaus of Cappadocia is Josephus in his book *Jewish War*, around 60 years after his death. If we want to dismiss the later references to Jesus at the end of the century and in the next, do we do this with all ancient sources that are not contemporary? Markus Bockmuehl argues in his book *Seeing the Word: Refocusing New Testament Study* that the date of a source doesn't necessarily become a serious problem for the core of the story until we are 150+ years out from the events. Indeed, the 100–150-year timeframe after an event is when 'living memory' ends (e.g., when people who knew eyewitnesses typically all die out). Hence the time frame used here.",

        "text": "Religiously confused…\nOk, so I was raised in a conservative catholic household. I struggled with my identity so badly, because after years of CCD classes and going to church, everything was taught like it was their way or the highway. For examples: someone once gave me a list of sins. I checked off what applied- haha I selected half the list. Then I was told that I could make all of it go away with some rosary prayers and confession. All would be good. But not certain things. Those things you would definitely go to hell for. I was taught no premarital sex- guilty. No birth control- I didn’t wanna get pregnant at 15 so wtf- guilty. The 10 commandments- ok- I was a wild child. \nAt first felt guilty missing church or CCD class when I got sick for an extended amount of time. It’s not like it mattered now that I look back- none of my peers cared about CCD, they were all there because their parents made them be. I thought confirmation was awesome, because you could decide what religion you truly belonged to. Ok cool! But my parents strong beliefs were that we were Catholic for life once we are baptized. I could never find a religion that I fit in with. I believe there is a spiritual God, and don’t want to go to hell for blasphemy. But on the other hand don’t really think humans are capable of going to hell. Like, evil and demons exist and can manifest in people. They are supernatural beings and live in hell. Like everyone, no matter how sick this sounds, is worthy of being forgiven for their sins and live in eternal peace. I believe in spirits and the paranormal. I believe in rights for LGBT+, women’s reproductive rights, mental health rites. I don’t believe you should be required to go to church. I do seek guidance from the saints occasionally asking for protection. While I agree with the historical accounts of Jesus (miracles were performed, the Virgin Mary was actually a virgin, etc). But I don’t really think he’s still around much, cuz there are billions of people to take care of, I’ve never witnessed a miracle, and, well, he was a great guy, but he’s dead. I take the Bible with a large grain of salt because they wrote it years after his physical death. I don’t believe you should have to pay the church or that your contribution should define who gets to go to heaven or if you get their name in biggest section of the church newsletter. I believe people should pay it forward with random acts of kindness, charity, or volunteering instead. I love Christmas and Easter, purely because it encourages giving to others. I believe in science and technological advances, that people were created to learn about that stuff. I also believe in some homeopathic remedies. A balance of the two. I think that we evolved from maybe another creature(s) and that the human race came from another planet/dimension, but God created the universe. I’m struggling lately because I can’t find a religious practice that supports my beliefs. If there is a hell, I’m definitely going there. I’ve caused a lot of heartache in my life and believe a form of karma exists. Haha… can anyone help me figure out what to do? I need guidance in my life due to some medical conditions and mental illness. My dad was mentally I’ll and thought he was a prophet for a while. It fucked me up all over again. My friends and family are all Christians or agnostic/atheists and think I’m just nuts.",

        "author": "feanoric",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/z2xn7g/why_do_christians_consider_the_old_testament_in/",
        "text": "Muslims do recognize the Hebrew Bible, and parts of the Christian Bible, but they give special priority to the Koran. This makes sense as Koran is the foundation of their faith, perfectly relevant for them and their faith.\n\nI wonder why Christians still view the Old Testament / Hebrew Bible as equal to the New, if at the end only the New is closely relevant to them, since the Old is important to understand the New, but not directly useful for Christians. Remember Christians today are Gentiles and do not need to follow Moses Law, although first Christians were Jewish too and even practiced circumcision.\n\n**So sure, it makes sense to include the Old Testament in the Bible for context for the New, but Why regard is as High as the New if it is not as relevant?**\n\nI do get the fact that first Christians were Jewish too, so obviously they did find the Hebrew Bible as the most Relevant, and also, they did not have the New Testament anyway, yet that changed as Christianity became almost exclusively a Gentile's religion.\n\nSome Greek Christians tried to get rid of irrelevant Jewish tradition of the Canon, such as [Marcion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope), but he later was considered as a heretic, so it seems this line of thought is not new. Gnostics also had a strong disdain for YHWH as the mechanic or even evil Demiurge, which means some first Christians did not have any problem disregarding the Old Testament, but that is different from simply not seeing it as important as the New.\n\n**TLDR** my point: It seems to me that the only reason Christian today consider the Old Testament as important as the New is because tradition and inertia, because first Christians thought so. However, the New is the only Testament directly related to Christians and the foundation of the faith, which is Christ. Or maybe there another reason I'm ignoring?",
