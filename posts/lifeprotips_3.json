I then tried calling back a couple times to verify that if I say this magic phrase it'll work, and it did.\n\nLast month I was trying to speak to a human at &lt;a very famous US bank&gt; about an overcharge, and again I was just not able to get to a person. I then decided to try the same trick, and saying \"returning a call\" got me in queue for a person immediately.\n\nSince then I've been trying this every time I spend more than 3 minutes trying to reach a company, and I've had good results, altohugh obviously your mileage may vary as every support phone system is different.\n\nHopefully this can save many of you hours of hitting the phone frustratingly!",

        "text": "Hello fellow Redditors. In case you did not know, NordVPN has a free product called Meshnet, this feature can help improve your gaming experience with you fellow friends while playing various multiplayer games. In general, Meshnet allows it’s users to form encrypted remote networks and turn compatible private devices into VPN endpoints for themselves and their friends. The best part it that Meshnet can be used as a stand alone product, you don’t need NordVPN subscription to use it and it's totally free!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are a few key use cases of Meshnet that can help elevate your gaming with your friends:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Throw a remote LAN party with your friends** \\- When Meshnet forms an encrypted private network, the devices on that network will treat each other much like they would if they were all on the same WiFi network. This can make it easier to host uninterrupted private LAN parties on video games that support this function. No more complaints about random disconnections while playing with friends!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Host a server for your friends** \\- user could connect their own server to the network and use it as a LAN hosting platform for their friends. Users can connect 10 of their own devices and link to up to 50 other devices in a Meshnet, so you could potentially form a large private community around your own server;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Share IP addresses** \\- compatible devices can be used by Meshnet as VPN endpoints. This allows you to use the same IP address that your friend uses, potentially granting access to servers or features that you could not have accessed otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps someone, happy gaming!",

To me, it feels as if I ran a whole marathon, but in reality I've been sitting on the couch for five minutes. This also makes it extremely hard to get work or pretty much anything done.\n\nAnother one is how anxiety is often caused by ADHD. For example: You can't get anything done because you feel tired all the time, but this leads to you not finishing school work. After that, everytime you're assigned school work, you get extremely anxious, as you feel you won't finish it. At that point, not only are you tired, you're anxious as well.

In summer I am able to disconnect completely and, since I don´t have any responsibilities/I don´t put any pressure on myself to do things such as waking up early, taking courses, etc (things regarding productivity and stuff to do), I sleep really well. I don´t even need my alarm clock because  my body gets up at the same time everyday by itself.\n\nHowever, the rest of the year, I try to te be disciplined, study every day, exercise 3 times a day, etc, etc but this has been impossible to achieve, not because of lack of discipline, but due to the next situation: I get into bed at, let´s say,11:30, setting my alarm clock for 8:30the next day (good amount of sleep right there, 9 hours). I don´t fall asleep until 1:30-2:00, so I end up turning off the alarm because I wanna sleep more than 7 hours tbh, I value sleep time and I think it´s very important for the body. The next day, the whole planning I had made is useless because it would start at 8:30 but I end up getting up at like 10-10:30 so I feel useless and frustrated.\n\nWhat exactly happens to me when I get into bed is that random thoughts start coming to my head and it´s hard for me to stop them. I have tried :\n\n1. Writing down everything I have to do the next day. (Maybe I don´t think anymore about what I need to do the next day but other random thoughts come to my head)\n2. Listening to white noise at low volume (give me headaches). I have also heard about putting a TV show on but I know it wouldn´t work for me because I am the type of person that needs 100% silence to sleep sadly)\n3. Breathing techniques such as the 4-7-8 but random thoughts come to me after I take the first breath.\n4. Melatonin (the problem isn´t that I am not tired, is my head, so this doesn´t calm down my thoughts)\n\nI am desperate to find a solution. If you have a similar story and have found a solution please let me know. Thank you in advance",

Turn the microwave on high for several minutes (start with 5 or 6) and *don’t leave it*. When the popping slows to once every few seconds, note your time and turn off the microwave. \n\nHandle the hot container with care and add whatever amendments you enjoy.\n\n45 ounces of store-brand popping corn near me: $3.49.
