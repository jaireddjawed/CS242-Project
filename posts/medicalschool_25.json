Im 4th year medical student and my goal is the practice something under the umbrella of IM more specifically (Pulmonology or Cardiology) . Currently im doing fine in med school I really find my self heavily interested in the patophysiology of the disorders and trying my best to learn as much as possible. My question is from your perspective as residents do you think focusing mainly on studying broad spectrum books like Harrison and Robbins going to be more favourable to me, or instead choosing a certain specialty and start reading mainly from books for that certain specialty. Of course during the majority of time , im studying for what my next exam requires , im talking about extra studying here . Thank you üôè.",

For the other transitional year programs, I would pair them with the same advanced programs, but lower on the list.\n\nI'm wondering if this is feasible. If I'm unable to secure a spot in that particular transitional year program, I would still like to have a chance at the advanced programs, but I would rank them lower if I have to complete a different transitional year program with them.\n\nThank you!",

Is this normal? Have you felt the same while studying it?\n\nFor the record I'm an italian medical student, I'll have the exam in July and it's gonna be on the whole human anatomy, and I'm studying alone (lectures are pointless in my university).\n\nSorry if I made some mistakes, english is not my first language",
