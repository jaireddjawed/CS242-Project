        "text": "*Let me just start off emphasizing, I have no problem with less experienced programmers, in fact I love being able to share knowledge across all experience levels, and we all started at the bottom at some point.*\n\nSo I'm a senior software engineer at the company I work for, and we have this, I guess with 5+ years experience, \"intermediate\" developer in the department, though personally \"junior\" would be a more fitting title. Let's call this specific developer, Marvin for the remainder of this story.\n\nNow, my patience with lesser experienced programmers in Marvin's case is non-existent, for no other reason than that Marvin believes he knows everything, and his ability to state wildly incorrect information as matter-of-fact, is as frightening as it is infuriating when I think of others who may not know any better, but are the targets of his misinformation.\n\nOne thing I can depend on Marvin for though, is entertainment. On almost a daily basis Marvin is able to deliver what I've termed \"gems\" which, because of his \"know-it-all\" personality, are hilarious (and oftentimes sad) concrete examples of how little he actually knows. What's even more amazing is that he is oblivious to what these \"gems\" demonstrate.\n\nA programmer friend of mine, with whom I share almost all of these as they happen, has often said I should be documenting these in some way, but I've never really taken the suggestion up. Until today.\n\nToday, Marvin delivered the most truly sad gem of them all, and I just could not resist sharing it.\n\nWe have a utility function, let's call it *taxFn* that takes in some currency value, in cents, as an integer and returns some tax value applicable to this amount, also in cents, and also as an integer. eg.\n\n&gt; *If we have $1 and tax at 16%. taxFn(100) = 16. or $0.16*\n\nPretty straightforward, right?\n\nFor the purpose of this story let's assume taxFn applies a 16% tax to the amount passed in and returns just the tax amount.\n\nNow Marvin is tasked with displaying this tax amount on an invoice, in the conventional form of $0.00. After \"figuring out\" that the function returns the value in cents, Marvin works his magic and discovers that if he divides this amount by *100* he can get it into the form he needs for display. So without any further ado, here is the gem:\n\n    int tax = taxFn(5500) / 100; // 16% of 5500 = 880\n\nAfter all this, Marvin has a problem, a problem he just cannot solve. After some time, he reports to his team lead, and explains the situation, as if the computer is obviously at fault -\n\n&gt; \"The taxFn function returns the amount in cents, so I've had to divide it by 100. It should be $8.80, but it just keeps coming back as $8 after the divide...\"\n\n...\n\nAnd that's Marvin folks.",

No need for cumbersome types like List&lt;T&gt;. No need for those slow ReDims.\n\n* Fourth, despite this being an array in .NET, the programmer has decided to keep a second attribute to keep track of the count of real data in the arrays. So every time the array is altered the separate counter was updated too.\n\n* Fifth, yes, the rest of the project is just as bad.",
