They do such a bad job with the character's backstory that you just don't feel any connection or empathy for anyone. They chose to make the episode black and white just to cut corners, nothing's added to the overall tone. I can probably say with confidence that this is the worst episode in the whole show. But there are some good things like the set designs and some of the visual effects. Honestly I wish they would of made the episode about how things got to how they are instead of just showing the aftermath. \n\nThat's just my opinion tho. If you like the episode let me know why.",
