Our story begins, of course, with a clueless user.....\n\n   My call began with the usual pleasantries, then the user asked me if anybody else was having issues with a particular website. She had been able to access it no problem for a long time, but this morning she got a message stating it was blocked by our firewall. (For the record, I work for a fairly large financial institution). \n\n\n  I asked what site it was, and she said, \"Well, it's for PDFs, so I can break a large PDF down to smaller documents. It's called splitpdf.com\".\n\nAt that I cringed, and asked her why she didn't use Amyuni (like everybody else here). She stated that that was a converter, she needed to break down PDFs. I explained how Amyuni worked, even showed her how to save so many pages at a time. She was blown away that she could do this with an application already on her computer!\n\n\nThis woman has been here for close to 2 years. And has been using a third party website to break down sensitive financial documents the whole time.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I used to work for an MSP and we had just signed on a new client. This client had an in-house IT resource that we were replacing who had kept them limping along for the past few years (side note: he didn't know he was being replaced until right before the first meeting we had with their staff. That was an awkward meeting.). At one of our first meetings with the manager of this business, they mentioned that the previous IT guy had a quote fro another third party for migrating them from Exchange 2007 to Office 365.\n\n\nWe took a look at the quote as we had done those kind of migrations before and at least part of it would be covered under their new contract. This quote was indeed for professional services and licensing to migrate them to Office 365 but it was from an ISP and also had line items for a new dedicated line to their building and a 3-year contract. We told the manager that: A) we'd be able to handle the migration, and B) they already had redundant WAN links so they didn't need anything on the quote. The manager was happy and we all kind of shook our heads at why the previous guy would ever get a quote for a third internet connection.\n\n\nTurns out the previous guy SIGNED that quote and claimed he had the authorization to approve it, so the ISP wanted their money either for the quote or for the termination fee of the contract he just signed for. He tried to claim that he didn't think it was a \"final quote\" (then why'd you sign it, bud?) and that he would be able to cancel the extra internet connection before they actually ran it to the building.\n\n\nI have no idea what came of that situation because it wasn't my company's business at that point and I left the MSP shortly after we took this client on. This was the same IT guy that, for reasons unknown, ordered toner from a third party that up-sold him refurbished cartridges. We saved the company time and money by buying them off Amazon before getting a dedicated printer management company involved.",

Since we try to recreate our customers' environment, so we can assure that our deployed software will meet their needs, we got a sample set of their test-database. The customer had asked to take one product out of the software, which one of our developers somehow tried to solve by just disabling it by default. Since the customer can enable it again in the settings, the customer got mad and asked us to deploy the software without the product being an option.\n\nThey tried to figure this out by themselves for about two days without making an inch of a process. Then they come to me.\n\n-----------------\n\n&gt;$Dev: Hey $CIT, are you proficient with Oracle databases?\n\n&gt;$Me: No, but I'm proficient at using google.\n\n&gt;$Dev: Hmpf....We tried that already. I doubt you can be of help here.\n\n&gt;$Me: The customer is already mad and you are still at square one.

I just used that as a test. I only need to change the ID there and there, and it will be fine?\n\n&gt;$Me: Uhm...yeah, but did you just make me delete a line that you actually need?\n\n&gt;$Dev: *starting to turn pale* oh oh...\n\n&gt;$Me: No backup I assume?\n\n&gt;$Dev: No...\n\n&gt;$Me: *Sigh* I will see what I can do.\n\n---------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\n$Dev makes me delete an important line as a test before deleting the actual line, without having a backup of the important line.\n\n------------\n\nEdit:\n\nJust to create a better understanding. Let's say we sell a software for companies who sell cars (although we don't, I just cannot describe it in English what we actually do). Now the company doesn't want to sell Ferrari anymore and wants us to take that option out of our software. Then $Dev makes me delete Porsche first as a test. Then our testers couldn't fully test the software anymore, because it crashed when they selected a Porsche.",

One batch at a time, approx. 500  every two weeks so Helpdesk won't blow up.\n\nDuring this transition where this a mix of Windows 7 and 10 users, we are using different remote tools and the fastest way to learn whether og not they are currently using Windows 10 is to ask the user, right?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are the answers my colleagues and I have been getting the past two weeks:\n\n* Yes (90% of the time it is infact no) \n* Maybe... how do I tell?\n* I don't know, don't ask me such a geek question '***giggles***'\n* Yes I think so.. Outlook does indeed look different (I have NO idea what they are talking about)\n* Are we getting Windows 10!? \n* Yes I do! I want Windows 7 back!\n* Uhh.....uhm......\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd my personal crown jewel when I asked a user if her Windows looked any different in the last couple of days:\n\n***Yes! Wait, maybe.... I'm not sure, how do I know if I have Windows 10? Is it like the Windows 10 I have at home!?*** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow I just look up their computers in our inventory and see it myself. I don't have the time nor crayons to explain our users which OS they have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Edit 1:** Bless your hearts, people. You are indeed the bringers of light, steadfast champions of IT support. \n\n*\"Never give up, every attempt makes you one step closer to success\"* - every recent IT graduate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust to clarify a few things:\n\n* We have a script that shows their computer name, username, IP adresses, Office license, Uptime and finally Windows version in the upper right corner on the Desktop. We were just assuming that they would know if we asked. Pretty naive, I know.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Shortcuts and typing a simple command is grand, but we have users that thinks Windows is click-only. They think you can only write in browsers, Outlook and Word. Luckily we recently added Windows version to our BGinfo script.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome have also suggested a temporary backbground with Windows 10 written all over it, but 6 months ago our HR &amp; Relations had the brilliant idea of making 10 backgrounds, in different colors, with vomit inducing motivational texts not even Crossfit quotes could match.  \n\nBased on a similar incident from 5 years ago, we strongly advised against it. There were still employees from the last armageddon in the department, but it was af if they had lost all their memory in a freak accident.\n\n\nOur Helpdesk was utterly obliberated by the stampede of wilderbeasts, demanding that we revert back to the standard background. Some even called it a virus. We also had to deactivate comments and up/downvotes on the news we had on our Intra site because users were spewing molten lava all over it.\n\n\nHR wanted us to change the background every day for 3 weeks. Every day our users would login to a new background in a different color with an annoying text, in various lengths, that messed with their shortcuts position differently each day. What was even worse, was that some of the colors made it hard to see some shortcuts and some even became almost invisible. I haven't seen such clusterfuck since I raided in vanilla WoW.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Edit 2:** \nI put on my robe and wizard hat for you, Heroes! You are indeed the long arm of IT Support. I'm all in for the round vs. square start button and menu tips and used it a couple of times before we added Windows version in our background script. Initially, I just like to start my conversation with a jovial greeting and ask; so, are you on Windows 10 now or..? and not ***do you have a round or square start menu!? Tell me now!***",

        "text": "TVs are a priority\nSo currently I work as help desk at a moderately sized retailer.  We have several TVs out on the floor displaying commercials and demos throughout our establishment and our IT dept is small so we also end up being the A/V department too.  \n\nA ticket comes in last week about getting these two TVs in one of the departments running.  The user had stated that they hadn’t ran in a year and they needed to get them back online as soon as possible.  This was what they said was “per the owner of the business.”  A lot of people use that at this place to get what they want sooner.  It is a lot like kindergarten because they do not realize people have tickets in front of them they are waiting on.  \n\nSo our other help desk guy looks into it and says we need remotes(this all seemed cut and dry at first...at first). Initially they were saying we needed remotes and the ones they had for the TVs weren’t working(more on that later.)  \n\nFast forward and a wait on purchasing remotes a week later, we get a knock on the door by one of the users who claims themselves as “the right hand” of the owner.  Saying that the owner wanted these TVs soon and what is the status.  Well somehow other parties decided they would get involved and knocked on our door and was asking what was needed.  So we had several people demanding we get these TV up and running.  Well….\n\nOur POS also A/V person decides to go down there and help out and check into it as she wanted to see if the remotes for said TVs were working.\n\nThe remotes had no batteries in them.  None, zip, zilch, nada.  \n\nThat’s point number one.  \n\n\nALSO,\nWhen our A/V person looked up, the TVs were on different hanging fittings(they hang from the ceiling.)  Everyone was wondering why the TVs would not come up with the content that previously displayed on them.  Now we don’t normally service stuff like this, but it just happens because it plugs in.  You know how that goes.  They had previously had DVD players hooked to them and were looping some commercials.  Well the person who redid the fittings for them…..took the DVD players and the DVDs with the content and had placed them in their shop as they thought they were not needed…….No one told us this.  We were not notified to get a different solution rolling.  Thankfully we had a device for playing videos that was easy to set up and were able to rip the DVDs for this five alarm emergency.  Everyone except for us, was wondering why the TVs wouldn’t play and said “No signal.”  There was no signal to be had….None at all.  You can’t play anything on a TV if you don’t have something hooking into it to play to it.  So once again we saved the day with as little information as possible despite being told one thing but not being delivered all of the information that was needed.  We all learned a lesson, but holy moly, the brilliant people we work with.  \n\nEdit: For clarity. Well turns out there was more to it than initially that I found out after the fact.  Our help desk initially went down and checked them out, when they were set up in their initial setup as DVD players. Turns out between when our tech got them running and yesterday, they had replaced the fittings and did not tell us. So the tech had gotten them running, however we were waiting on purchases to improve/upgrade them per him. So it was initially looked into, it was just altered between then and now.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\nTVs need a source to play video.  Remotes need batteries.  Who knew?!  Also it is never as cut and dry as you think it is.\n",

Wanted to post this to get it off of my chest, because I still can't believe it happened.\n\n$Sup- Other Tech\n$Boss- Branch Manager\n$Dale- Warehouse Supervisor\n$Davis- Test Room Supervisor\n\nLast week, I went ahead and set up two printers. One of which is a Zebra, and the other a EasyCoder. Since they don't make the EasyCoder anymore, it was difficult to find the drivers for it to work. The Zebra is set to Thermal Direct even though it uses a ribbon, because when it's set to Thermal Transfer it doesn't detect a ribbon. Printers, am I right?\n\nAnyways, onwards to a few days later.\n\nAfter setting up numerous keystone network jacks, waving my wand around the test room looking for ports to label, replacing label printers and power surges for testers, I get called into a secret meeting by $Sup. Thinking it was about one of the devices, I step in confidently, ready to tell him it was all good.\n\nBut all was not good. You see, $Company was losing money. They had to cut people, and I was one of them. It wasn't because of my work quality or ethic - they all loved and complimented it and myself. It was because I wasn't making the company profit, and being IT, got paid more than the testers. So they were going to cut me. $Sup said I could run a machine, so they let me stay. \n\nI felt betrayed, that all my hard work meant nothing. After setting up numerous sections for new stations, after fixing computers and networking, after everyone talking mess about $Sup, I was very close to getting cut. \n\nAs usual, I went out to talk to $Davis. I was upset and explained to him the situation. A few days later, $Davis told me that he told $Boss that he would have fucked up if they lost me, because $Sup doesn't do much. $Boss admitted to almost firing me, and I just felt unappreciated. \n\nI guess I.T., even though we make new stations and run networking and do everything behind the scenes... isn't profitable to businesses. Thanks. \n\nTL;DR : IT Tech almost gets fired because setting up new stations and fixing equipment doesn't make money apparently.",

The file wasn't actually moved by accident they actually create a subfolder, \"clean everything up a little\" and \"make a bit of order\". \n\nSomehow the information of moving a very important file around wasn't given any further.

She was a sweet lady with *some* experience but not much...\n\nGiven size of company we were all located in the same room.  Myself, the lead dev, and QA.  \n\nOne day I checked in a code change..and she was testing it.  The change was trivial, changing some display format on the user interface or something.  All she had to do was open up our software and go to that screen and see that the format had changed.\n\nShe calls out to me from her desk...\n\n\"*Hey, um, c4virus, I'm seeing an error when I'm testing that change.  It says it cannot find that path on the disk.*\"\n\nwtf...my change doesn't write anything to the disk...why would it error and why would it even say that...wtf...\n\nMe: \"*Hmmm...that's weird, can you show me?*\"\n\nI walk over to her desk.\n\nQA Lady:\"*WHAT...the error went away...it was there now its gone.  All you needed was to do was come over here hehee.*\"\n\nMe: \"*Oh ok, cool...yeah I have that power sometimes.*\"\n\n--10 min later--\n\nQA Lady:\"*HEY, there it is again, the error came up!*\"\n\nI hurry over to catch the error before it dissipates into the atmosphere.\n\nAs I get to her desk I see an error message on her screen.  I see her hit an arrow key on her keyboard and the screen changes and the error isn't displaying anymore.\n\n \"*WHATTT!!  It went away again!!*\"\n\nAs I get closer I see MS Picture Viewer open with a **screenshot** of our software showing.  She traces back her steps, hits the opposite arrow key, and a **screenshot** of an error message shows.  \"*There it is!*\"\n\nShe was just &lt;- -&gt; arrowing through jpegs with picture viewer...would come across some screenshot of an error from a month ago or something, and think that the application was throwing that error at that moment.\n\nI just stared for a moment...not knowing how to tell the only QA staff at a **software company** that a screenshot of an error is not actually an error.\n\nI left the company shortly thereafter.",

I know there are a couple of spare monitors there and I know he's not going to swap one out himself, so I head straight over.\n\nI get there and both monitors are fine - bright, clear, not jittery, etc. I figure the monitor was turned off or something similar and that he or his assistant fixed it themselves. He's in a meeting with one of his clients so I leave him a note saying everything appears to be fine now and I go back to my office. As soon as I get back my phone rings, it's the client, he's irritated because the monitor is still blank and I was there but didn't fix anything. Hmmm...\n\nI go back to his office (luckily they're only a few minutes away), he's sitting there in front of two perfectly fine monitors. I ask him what' going on, he points to one of the monitors and asks me if I'm blind since it's obviously too dim to use.\n\nIt's at this point I realize he's wearing sunglasses. Polarized sunglasses. Because he got an eye exam first thing this morning and they dilated his eyes. He didn't like the disposable glasses they gave him so he's wearing his own.\n\nTurns out that even though the monitors are identical Dell P2314H units that they're polarized in different directions. We share a good laugh, he tells me not to change anything because his eyes will be undilated in a couple of hours and I leave.\n\nWhat's even weirder is that as I'm driving back I realize I have two of the same model monitors on my desk. I bring my sunglasses in and sure enough, one of the monitors is fine and one can barely be seen through the shades.\n\nAt least it wasn't DNS.",

They offered onsite warranty repairs, and he paid a premium for that service; however, they actively tried to encourage people to ship them their PC so they (the company) could save money providing this service.\n\nMy friend wasn't having it; he wanted them to ship him the parts and he'd have me install them, paying us our usual hourly rate (we were a small ISP that also did PC support for local customers only) to do the work, but they told him that would void his warranty, so he said \"OK, then send somebody out.\"\n\nOf course they didn't have anybody in our area, so they looked for PC shops in the area (Google was around at this point, although most savvy searchers were still using Altavista) and found... us. So they called and asked to speak to \"the PC repair department\". Front desk routed them to me.\n\nAfter a fifteen minute interview and short conversation with my boss, they certified me as an official field support tech for their brand, and set up a time for me to go out there and do the work. By the time they informed the customer of the window in which I'd be arriving, I'd already called him and we'd had our good laugh.\n\nI never got another call from them.\n",

The person working the counter answering the phones, asked him to bring it back in. He dropped it off and when I checked it out, it all worked great. Called him to come pick it up and he did. This was followed by another call from him saying that the sound still wasn't working. This time we ask him to bring it in along with his speakers so we can try it in the store. He brings it in, we set it up, and it works great. We show him that it is working fine and again he leaves. He calls back again the next day, this time pissed, saying that the sound still isn't working. This time we tell him to bring it in, and we will let him set it up in the showroom.  \n  \nHe brings it in, and we let him hook everything up and turn it on.  \n  \nOnce its up and running, he very nastily says \"See, no sound!\"\n  \nFirst thing I notice is that he didn't turn the speakers on. \n\n&gt; ME: Sir, there isn't any sound because you didn't turn the speakers on  \n  \n&gt;Customer: I don't understand what you mean.   \n  \nI point at the power switch and show him that the power light is off  \n  \n&gt;ME: Sir, this knob turns the power on for the speakers, and also turns the volume up or down.   \n  \n&gt;Customer: Well, I have never had to turn that on before!  \n  \nWe determined that he had turned them on when he first purchased the computer and had never turned them off until he brought the computer in for service and didn't realize what he was doing.   \n  \nAt this point, we explained that the speakers had to have power to work, and without being turned on, he was not going to get sound out of them. He continued to argue that he shouldn't need power for them to work. I finally just went to the back and let the counter person deal with him. \n\nTL:DR - Customer couldn't get his speakers working because the power was turned off. ",

On mobile, so hopefully doing formatting right.\n\nI was working T1 at a Shared Service Desk for 6 companies who outsourced their IT to us. Almost all of them had one of ours as on-site technicians and a remote team of T1's and T2's to share helpdesk+sysadmin manpower and costs with the other 5 companies. As such, every morning we (3 to 4 T1's) were assigned one or two of the 6 to handle primarily and handle the other 4 to 5 secondarily. Really nice concept.\n\nThis story is at a law firm in our nation's capital, about 60 km from where I was. A few days prior to this story there was a nasty case of Cryptolocker at this company, so both the employees and the techs were still on edge for a recurrence. The employees at this law firm used Lync to make phone calls.\n\nThis story involves 3 people:  \n$OST: Our on-site technician whom we always have a chat window open with. Cool guy, but doesn't like incomplete information.  \n$User: actually did not much wrong  \n$Me: a very eager remote T1\n  \n  \nUser calls.\n$Me: $Good morning, Service Desk, this is WousV.\n\n$User: Hi, this is &lt;&lt;incoherent&gt;&gt; (I rarely got a caller's name at first). I'm seeing a suspicious icon I've never noticed before. I'm afraid it might be a virus.\n\n$Me (on full alert): Oy, very good to call us! We will investigate immediately. In the meantime, could you disconnect your computer from the network, so as not to spread the possible virus any further? Just disconnect the network cable. (These were instructions I learned just days prior)\n\n$User: Sure, right away!\n\n$Me: Good, now I... Wait... Hello? Sir? &lt;notices that the call is gone and realizing the mistake&gt;\n\n$Me (to $OST, sheepishly): Hi, I've got a guy at your company who suspects a virus because he sees an icon in the systray which he doesn't recognise. You know, with these last few days in mind, I told him to disconnect and... well, the call went with it... I don't know who it was or what his office is. My bad!\n\n$OST: Haha, alright, I'll go see if I can find him.\n&lt;status switches to busy&gt;\n\nAfter a couple of minutes $OST comes back online and updates me on the story.\n\n$OST: I found him. I just wandered around until I saw someone sitting cluelessly at their desk, doing nothing. He confirmed he got the instruction to disconnect, which he did. He pointed me to the icon he \"never saw before\". It's just the icon indicating that some shared drives have been mapped, it's entirely normal. I reconnected him and assured him that everything is fine.\n\n$Me: &lt;sigh of relief&gt; Wow, thanks, dude.\n\n$OST: Well, at least it was nothing serious this time and I think you've learned that you should know who's calling from where before asking them to pull the cable.\n\n$Me: Sure do!\n\nWe had a laugh about it.\n\nTL;DR: Don't pull the plug on a live phone call unless you have enough information.",

We (the tech's) get paid even if we cant fix something. But that is bad business, we have to fix all their problems to make a profit.\n\nSupervisor wants to send me to another tech's unfinished job. A customer can't locate some folders.\n\nRead the description from the other tech. Her PC died after a power surge, she just wanted him to transfer her files to her laptop. Tech takes HDD out, copies the whole user profile from her PC running Win 10 and paste's it on her Laptop's desktop. Shows her where everything is and leaves.\n\nA while later she calls us and complains that everything is not there. Some folders are still missing. Since the other tech is busy I have to head out.\n\nGet there and plug their old HDD back with a disk tool to their laptop. Their whole user profile is there. Everything has been copied, nothing is missing.\n\n&gt;Me: Do you know the location of the missing folders? Where they on the desktop? in my documents? where were they?\n&gt;Her: I don't know.\n&gt;Me: Do you know any of the names of the missing folders?\n&gt;Her: Of course.\n\nTells me some folder names. I run windows search for those terms. Nothing found. I decide the folders must have been not on her user profile. I am frantically opening random folders on her drive. Nothing. She is sitting next to me, face 1 foot away from the screen. Every 30 seconds she goes \"there it is\" followed by \"not its not that\". She is also repeating that the folders are really important and contains her drawings and photos.\n\nCall old tech asking if he had deleted anything. I know he wouldn't have deleted anything but I am out of ideas. He says he hasn't deleted anything. Thinking if perhaps maybe the drive was damaged by the power surge, but it is in perfect health according to SMART. After an hour of searching I give up.\n\n&gt;Me: I am sorry but the folders are just not here. Everything on your old PC has already been copied to the laptop. If it was there then it should be here.\n&gt;She: My folders are still missing. Where would they go? I need them back.\n\nI ask myself if she even knows what a folder is. Is it something else she is looking for. It can't be a folder she is missing, everything is here. It is plausible she does not know what a folder is.\n\n&gt;Me: Do you know how to create folders? The missing folders, Who created them?\n&gt;Her: Of course I know, I created them.\nMe: Show me by creating a folder.\n\nI stand back. She takes the mouse, OPENS OUTLOOK, RIGHT CLICKS HER INBOX AND CREATES A PERSONAL FOLDER\n\n&gt;Her: See\n\nI couldn't respond. All I did was stare at her. Definitely took a minute or two before I composed myself and snapped out of the shock. \n\nFound her outlook profile on her old HDD, imported it on the laptop. She is happy I found her folders. I still can't believe how I managed to find her folders. ",

So one of the first things is always checking the batteries. So I asked the lady who gave me the call to change the battery. She said she had already changed them to test and was reluctant to again. I asked her to get some fresh batteries just in case anyway (I never trust what users says they do).\n\nShe reluctantly agreed to swap them over but as she went to change them she told me \"I don't think the batteries are flat. They are still pretty heavy.\" After my five or so seconds of dead air because I was so stunned at this she said \"I'll be back in a second\".\n\nAfter the swap it still wouldn't work. She brought the keyboard down to my desk and I managed to sync it up on my computer and it worked fine. Took it back upstairs and it wasn't working again. I assumed it must have been interference because of all the devices on the same spectrum in the one area. \n\nI went up to the room to check and managed to resync the keyboard again. Then one by one they all stopped working in the room... it was then I checked where the first lady got the new batteries from... it was from the keyboard from the person next to her. Keyboards that were all bought at the same time and had been used roughly for the same amount of time.\n\nBut hey, the batteries were still pretty heavy so she thought they were still charged so new batteries weren't really needed...

He then followed up by checking the drivers in the computer to make sure that they were up  to date. Then he opened and checked the mouse:\n\n&gt;Him: Your mouse is not working because there is a small plastic piece blocking the battery from the connector. You need to take it out so that the battery is then able to supply power to the mouse.\n\n&gt;Person: Oh, I left it in there on purpose.\n\n&gt;Him: Why?\n\n&gt;Person: I thought that part is used to ventilate the mouse.\n\nHim said that to date, that is the worst tech support he has ever given to anyone. He is not sure why or even how that would ventilate the mouse but he did not question further as Person was well known to start 'issues' when someone questioned them on something that is wrong.",

I was working L3 support and IT infrastructure projects for an international application software company.  Very international, as will become relevant.\n\nI got a call from the VP of Finance, about 4 layers of mgmt above me.  It's weird not only because ~~he's talking to peons~~ requests usually flow downhill one manager a time, but also because we (*joy of joys*) reported to the VP of Product Engineering, who was a very clueful fellow.\n\n$VPF: We need a website.\n\n$Me: We have several websites - www.*companyname*.com, and a couple for each of our lines - www.*productname*.com.\n\n$VPF:  Get the product CDs and put them on it.  Customers need to ftp the software.\n\n$Me:  *Thinking - Oh dear, we've entered the Pointy Haired Boss Zone.*\n\n$Me: *Out Loud Voice* - Let's meet and discuss requirements.  I'll be right up.\n\n\nOur product had multiple versions, in 9 or so languages.  A typical installation (hw+sw) cost about the same as a new car for each user.    The installation media (4-5 CDs per version &amp; language) alone was several thousand dollars, but a common salesman's trick was to throw in several copies for free.\n\nThe typical user's connection was either 2400 or 9600 kbit/s; a business' connection might be a 1.54 mbit/s T-1.  Downloading it at T-1 speed was 12 hours, using all the recipients' bandwidth, and more importantly **all of ours**.  Or, you could dialup and take 75 days.\n\nI drag my boss into $VPF's office, and have him ELIF.  Seriously, he is a very sharp individual, but in areas completely removed from my experience.\n\nTo end a too long story shortly:\n\nWe are about to make a sale in $SpaghettiCountry, for multimillion $SpaghettiDollars.  If the product is delivered in physical form, it's considered importing a \"good\", and we owe outrageous sales taxes and import tariffs.  But there's a loophole - if the customer can download the software, it's a \"service\" and taxes are more reasonable.  Even better, the customer only needs the *ability* to download the software.  With that ability, we can ship them \"free\" *backup copies* of the installation media as a service!\n\nThe next day, the CD images for $SpaghettiSpeak are available on a protected corner of the website.  A few weeks later, a deal is signed.  The customer is given a login id/password, goes to the directory, and downloads the product Readme file.",

        "text": "Not a first time poster, but this is something I promised I would tell once things settled down a bit for me.\nTo say a couple words about my current job, I am a lv 1 and 2 system admin and general helpdesk, think of this job as being the DMZ of the company since we take all complaints and solve all problems.  \nOur motto is : what's documentation? Never heard of that.\n\nShort presentation of the couple protagonists : \n \n+ Armand : One of the IT head of the client in question  \n+ Bertrand : The IT head of said client  \n+ Ataruka : no clue  \n+ Claude : My manager, and colleague  \n+ $User : Either a genius or, actually a genius I think.\n\nIt's a nice and quiet day, we all mind our own business, and I'm trying to make heads and tales of one of our client's server because it's a huge legacy mess with GPOs dating all the way back from Windows Server 2003. We then get a supervision alert for this client : the internet line is down for the shop in Moncuq (Name changed to preserve anonimity obviously)  \nWe call the department in charge of internet lines, and ask them if they can reset the DSLAM and reboot the router. And then it hit us :  \n&gt;**Ataruka** : Hey Claude, what the hell is Moncuq?  \n&gt;**Claude** : Wait actually yeah, when did $Client have a shop in that town? Hold on lemme check the DHCP... Yup, it's there but no DHCP leases whatsoever. Can you call the shop and see what's going on?  \n&gt;**Ataruka** : Nope, it's not even listed in our ticketing system, nor is it in our client lists, nor in $Client's list so I got no phone number whatsoever.  \n&gt;**Claude** : I'll call Bertrand, hold on.\n\n\nThe following conversation then occurs :  \n&gt;&gt;**Claude** : Hey Armand, we got a net line down and we rebooted the router and DSLAM but what's that shop there? We never heard of it nor got calls from them, ever.  \n&gt;&gt;**Bertrand** : Are you sure you didn't get the wrong client? We don't have a shop there.  \n&gt;&gt;**Claude** : Mate, it's in your DHCP scope, it's even clearly labelled \"Moncuq\" like every single other scopes.  \n&gt;&gt;**Bertrand** : Hey Armand, you ever heard of our shop in Moncuq? (We hear a \"The hell you on about, that doesn't exist\")  \n&gt;&gt;**Claude** : We can totally ping the router and even got supervision for the line, why would you ask us to do that if you don't own it?  \n&gt;&gt;**Armand** : We don't have any shop there and you know it or you'd be getting calls to unlock their AS400 or the printers everyday.  \n&gt;&gt;**Claude** : So you are saying you are literally paying for a service that you don't use?  \n(We get a new supervision alert about this very line again)  \n&gt;&gt;**Claude** : Alright fine, good to know you are aware of what you own, ttyl buddy.\n\nI then start calling all the various shops of $Client, only to be met with negatives (mind you this is about 15 phone calls to cover ourselves). Claude calls the other department so they can prepare a new router and we prepare to send a technician there to see what the hell is going on.  \nAfter 3 hours of searches, I finally get a stupid idea, and google shop name + town. We have a potential phone number and address! I say potential because the name does not match $Client at all. I call the phone number and I get to talk to $User.\n\n&gt;**$User** : (Not Client shop), $User speaking, who's calling?  \n&gt;**Ataruka** : Hey, IT Support Ataruka calling , we got a bunch of alerts saying your net went down, but did you just say you are (Not Client shop)?  \n&gt;**$User** : Oh finally we managed to get you, yeah we have a bunch of problems here but the IT contact we had does not work anymore, it was $PreviousIT.  \n&gt;**Ataruka** : Wait, how do you know him? Are you part of $Client?  \n&gt;**$User** : Yeah, we are their partners and they let us use their internet lines, but since we never had to call you, we only ever talked to $PreviousIT, so we didn't have your phone number. We thought that if we disappeared from the radars you might get an alert of sorts, so we had been unplugging the router to cause an alert every 3 hours or so when we had time. So thanks for calling us! What's your phone number?\n\nAnd so we could then tell $Client that indeed, Moncuq does not have a shop, however they do have a partner of theirs there, we also gave them our phone number for future IT support, and added them to our ticketing system.\n\nAnd that is how we wasted half a day just to give a phone number.\n\nI'm not too good at writing stories, but feel free to tell me if something sounds off in there or you see grammar/spelling mistakes.",

        "text": "I'm in an IT class with eight guys. In said class, we run help desk for the entire campus. Computers, Chromebooks, teacher projectors, printers, laptops, we do it all.\n\nThis morning, $Teacher assigned me and $OtherTech to do some inventory and labeling on a Chromebook cart for one of the classrooms. As $OtherTech and I are working, $Student walks into the classroom. He's from another class next door, and he decided to walk in and ask a question.\n\nThis isn't an issue. We get people all the time who walk in with laptops and such that needs fixing (broken screen, need WiFi password, etc). The issue was, $Student didn't have a laptop or Chromebopk on him. The brief conversation went a little something like this.\n\n$Student: Are you help desk? I have a problem.\n$Me: I, uh, yeah, uh. . . $Teacher is over there, go ask him.\n\nUsually, people called in if they have an issue. If $Student didn't know the number, he could've asked his teacher, since our number is an easy to remember extension (but knowing said teacher, he probably thought to send $Student over because we're next door).\n\nI was so thrown off, and I figured his issue was so advanced and out of my knowledge range that I sent him to the wise-and-all-knowing $Teacher.\n\nA few minutes later, $OtherTech and I are still working. We found out what the problem was through $Teacher (after he got mad at us for sending $Student to him for a basic help desk question).\n\nThere's a 3D printer in $Student's classroom. To access it, you log in to the computer sitting next to it. There's instructions pinned right next to the computer that tell you in plain and clear English the exact username and password used to log into that particular computer. But $Student, apparently oblivious to any and all written directions, decided that using his domain login would work.\n\nIt didn't. He thought his account didn't work. But he learned that the problem was he didn't read. Unfortunately, we get a lot of calls like this one.\n\nTL;DR: If there's words around a computer, and they look like instructions, read them before calling tech support. It saves us a lot of pain and suffering.",

Her name is C.\n\nMe- ok thank you but I would need to speak with her to verify her information, would it be possible to speak to her right now?\n\nCM- yes here she is.\n\nC- yes?\n\nMe- Hello, would you be able to verify *basic personal info*\n\nC- yes, (in the background I hear her mom tell her exactly what to say word for word even though I just asked for her phone, DOB and address)\n\n\n\nI notice her birthday shows  she’s 26 which was kind of weird her mom was trying/had to tell her what to say for her acct info and personal info.\n\n\nMe- ok great C, did you just need help completing setup or did you need logging in help too?\n\n*CM takes phone away from C*\n\nCM- excuse me? I told you we just got this discount and we don’t know what to do!!\n\nMe- ok I apologize I wasn’t sure if you needed login assistance as well but I can definitely assist with that today but I would need to speak with C again to verify more info before I provide her login info.\n\nC- hello?\n\nMe- Hi C, before I can reset your login I would have to send a code by either email or text message. Just to make sure, what email and cell should we have on file for you? \n\nCM- what email do you have for my daughter?\n\nMe- I’m sorry I’m not able to say it over the phone but if C provided it I would be able to confirm if that’s what we have on file or not.\n\nC- it should be abc@yahoo.com\n\nCM- is that what you have on file??\n\nMe- no it is not but I will definitely update it.\n\nCM- OK WELL YOU NEED TO UPDATE IT, IT SHOULDVE BEEN CHANGED A LONG TIME AGO.\n\nMe- I will, I apologize about that.

How come you didn’t get that down when she told you?\n\nMe- I’m sorry the number she provided I didn’t see on file so I just wanted to make sure what her cell number was but if that previous number is her cell I will update it. \n\nCM- YOU NEED TO UPDATE HER CELL AND EMAIL, CAN YOU DO THAT RIGHT NOW??\n\nMe- I will update it but since I can’t send the verification code to either right now can C verify her acct number?\n\nCM- alright but you better update it after she tells you.\n\nMe- yes mam.\n\nC- gives me acct number and other info i need after I hear her mom told her everything to say again.\n\nMe- great thank you I will update your cell and email on file right now. Your username is your first and last name, no spaces and I just emailed you your temporary password.\n\nCM- ok hold on! What’s her password? \n\nMe- I emailed it to her.

What else do I need to do?\n\nMe- no I’m sorry you won’t get an email about completion but the message you just read off is your confirmation and my system shows you set it up correctly so great job.

(Thats another tale) \n\nThe gist of it was that the user wanted to forward all emails to an outside email address not protected by our firewalls. Big fat nope on that one. \n\nTwo week later. \n\nAn EVP of marketing calls me on my personal cell phone on my off day wondering about this issue. Now I have a google voice numer listed in the company directory. He should not have this number. NO ONE at work should have this number. \n\n&gt; $EVP - Can you tell me why you told *end user* no the other day in regards to his email request.  \n&gt; $Me - How did you get this number?  \n&gt; $EVP - It was on your resume. I pulled it from there.  \n&gt; $Me - Ok please use the number listed on the company directory in the future, I do not answer unknown numbers on this line. I only picked up because the CID said *our company*  \n&gt; $EVP - I will keep that in mind.  \n&gt; $ME - To answer your question it was because it would be a massive security violation. He wants to forward email that is protected by our security systems to email that is not on our network and is not protected by our systems. Possibly even unprotected and compromised. Look we can get the CIO on this. He will definitely back me and and *ceo name* will back up CIO.  \n&gt; $EVP - I will have end user call you on your next day in the office. \n\nA few days later I am sitting in office when my phone rings on the direct line. Not one of the distributed phone calls, but my direct line. \n\n$EU = End user\n\n&gt; $ME - This is $me with IT.  \n&gt; $EU - This is end user. I wanted to talk about my request to have my email forwarded.  \n&gt; $Me - *Massive sigh* Ok what is the email address?  \n&gt; $EU - It is *email@cs.com* I have had it for nearly 20 years and everyone knows to reach me there. \n\nMy first thought was \"You're a mortgage agent, I would hope you dont have a large number repeat customers.\" In reality I said. \n\n&gt; $me - Ok Ill take a look. Wait... @cs.com? Why does that sound familiar... (eyes wide) What company is that from?  \n&gt; $EU - Its an old email address. Original from compuserve. \n\nI slap the mute button on my mic. The peter griffon joke actually happened in the wild. Im trying to contain my laughter hard. \n\n&gt; $EU - Hello? You there?  \n&gt; $Me - (Much higher pitched voice.) Hmm. That was unexpected.  \n&gt; $EU - Why? Is that a bad one? I have another we can use.  \n&gt; $ME - *mutes mic* I am going to regret asking this. *Unmutes* What is the email address?  \n&gt; $EU - Oh it is *email@sbcglobal.net* ... what was that banging sound?  \n&gt; $me - Sorry I set my cup down too hard. Just out of pure curiosity, do you have any older email addresses that you still use?  \n&gt; $EU - No just those two and an old yahoo mail. I dont use the AOL or Hotmail accounts anymore.    \n&gt; $ME - OK well I will push these onto the CIO and we will see what happens. \n\nOpen skype, click CIO, give him the news. I hear loud raucous laughter from down the hall. Half because his request was just a huge no, half because compuserve. He gave the NO on it and sent the end user the email. \n\nI open a ticket with security and let them know which email addresses need to be blocked. They message me back stating \nthat they do not appreciate any joke tickets in their queue. I corrected them, and then copied the ticket into the IT queue. I figured the guys and gals could use a good laugh. ",

        "text": "A long time ago at a help desk that has sense gone belly up.  One of the many things we provided support for was a shirt lived brand of computers.  To use the term generic is much too generous.  These computers were such junk.  A violent sneeze while in another room was enough to cause a complete system melt down.\n\nAfter a while of taking calls it's easy to fall into the grind of zoning out and being a mindless drone of helping people set up printers and dial up or tuning out and muttering \"uh huh....yea....I know.....yea...I get it.\" as users whine about slowness or how the wifi isn't as good as third friends Dell blah blah.  Or people bitching that Yahoo changed their layout and they want it changed back.\n\nBut one day I was in a good mood and a got a call from a man who's name I long forgot so let's call him joeyjoejoe\n\nJoeyjoejoe called and by luck of the round robin call system landed on my phone.  This man had the kind of old guy voice that made you immediately like him.  Like feel compelled to want to hug him kind of soft cheerful grandpa voice a man only achieves by a life time of kindness and love.\n\nThis gentleman was clearly new to computers and had a list of things he needed help with.  His demeanor instantly disarmed my cynical view of customers and i decided come hell or high water me and this man we're going to knock every item off his list call time be damned\n\nAs I walked him through various updates and configs which requires several reboots, I turned the ticket into a sort of narrative.  I type everything we talked about.  I wrote about the dial up connection we set up, his child hood, being sent off to war and how it took a toll on him.  We talked about him meeting his wife and what it was like falling in love with her.  He talked and I wrote about what it was like for him to become a father for the first time and the love that filled his life.  About the first time he became a grand pa how again his life was over filled with love.  This man really enjoyed his family.  You could hear the uke in his voice as he bragged about his kids and grandkids kids and naturally you could hear the love as he spoke about his wife.   I wrote everything in his ticket.\n\nWhere it happened how it happened.  Typically our tickets were much more mundane \n\nProblem:. Needs help with dial up connection printer and driver etc etc\n\nAction:. Installed set up blah blah\n\nResolution:. Cx is happy \n\nBut not this time.  It was a biography of this man's life.\n\nWe talked about his first car.  And how he paid for it by working his ass off.  He came from very parents of very modestly means but they too overflowed with love.  He told me about the day his father passed away.  His father he loved so dearly had a rough but if health for a while as he slowly died in a hospital bed.  Joeyjoejoe's every spare moment was spent at his father's side.  Joeyjoejoe shared words with me at this point in the call I will never forget.  With obvious tears in his eyes and a Shakey voice he said to me \" my father reached for my hand, and gripped it tightly.  He gently pulled me closer and with a whisper now my father.....   ..... My father wasn't a religious man but....  but... he said  ... ....*snuffle* 'the angels are coming' with a very slight smile on his face.  It was then his grip slowly weakend and....and he was gone *deep sigh*\". We were both silent for a moment.  I could tell it was hard for him to make it through that part of his story.  A tear slipped down my cheek as I finished typing.   With a deep breath he moved on with his story.  Back to he and his wife plans for the weekend and how he was excited to get his computer going to better communicate with his beloved family.\n\nWe were on the call for just over two hours.  We wished each other well and good day and that was that.  I finished up the ticket saved and closed it.\n\n2 weeks later or so a co-worker shouted over the cube to me and said \"hey I've got joeyjoejoe on the phone, he wants me to tell you hi also what is going one with this ticket man?\". \n\nI smirked, I told him to tell him hi for me and then gave the tech a quick rundown of the things we did.  I then told the tech he should copy and paste the ticket I to notepad and give it a read.\n\nThe tech took care of joeyjoejoe and took my advice to read the ticket.  The tech told me the ticket was so amazing and kinda heavy a bit.  We both shared a smile.\n\nThat was the last time I ever heard from my short time pal joeyjoejoe.  If he's still out there kicking around I hope he and his family are doing well.  I also hope he knows I think about him from time to time.",

        "text": "Ok, so the other day I told you about a systems repair/upgrade that I took care of in Massachusetts back in the early 2000s. One of the days while I was working on it, we had an incident that had me worried.\n\nSo, I arrive onsite to do the job. Because this was put together so quickly, and because I was a foreign national (Canadian) they weren't able to complete the proper security clearances for me to be issued a pass for the building. I couldn't get in or out without assistance, but they had no qualms about leaving me in their server room, with the admin password. Not a unique situation in my career.\n\nSo, this server room they would leave me in, required a pass to enter **and** exit. So, when they would leave me in the server room, I wasn't going anywhere. It was an old style server room, with a raised floor that still had the marks from the old mainframe/midrange gear that had been removed a few years previously. It also had a Halon system dating from the 1980s.\n\nNow, this was a state government office, with a large waiting room where members of the public would wait for long periods of time just to be told that they have the wrong forms, they were in the wrong line, that they need to make an appointment to come back next week... all the usual government indignities that you can never seem to avoid.\n\nOn the second day I was there, someone was told something they didn't like, stormed out, and pulled the fire alarm on their way (also not a first in my experience... I used to work in the same building as a Revenue Canada tax office... lots of annoyed people leaving there). So I'm working away in this server room when the fire alarm goes off. No problem, grab my jacket and leave... except I'm locked in the room. With a Halon system. Locked. In.\n\nSo I run to the complete other end of the room, where the override button for the fire suppression system is and I jam my thumb down on that button. HARD. (My understanding of Halon is that it works by absorbing/replacing/displacing all the oxygen in the room. Now, as an animal, I *need* some of that oxygen, so the prospect of being locked in a room with no breathable air is not one I relish).\n\nSo there I am, standing in the corner of the room, with my finger on the button. In a couple of minutes the alarms stop. I'm still holding the button (I have no idea what will happen when I release it, and I'm not about to chance it). More time passes, still holding the button. A couple of time I very carefully change which finger is holding the button as they get sore. I'm in this for the long haul.\n\nAbout 2 hours later, someone comes in to check on me... lo and behold, I'm still there in the corner holding the button. I agree to release it, only if he agrees to hold the door open so I can make a quick exit just in case.\n\nI release, nothing happens, I go have a well-deserved, late, lunch.\n\nTL;DR: Locked in a room with a halon system, fire alarm goes off, I stand in the corner holding the override button for 2 hours until someone comes to rescue me.",

Well, some users (management) got very confused when using the portal, so I disabled it and sent a mass email explaining what the new procedure was and how to initiate a ticket, blah blah. It worked great, the majority of the people got with the program and they now put in tickets for all their issues but there is always that ONE person, $User.\n\n$User has been with this company for a long time, and my boss warned me that she will try to get us to bend the rules of her and that is how this tale begins!\n\nShe sent an email to my boss at 12:58 stating:\n\n$User: \"Hi, $boss I got a new device over the weekend and I need to set up the Wi-Fi on it.\"\n\nMy boss didn't even get a chance to reply when I get the same message 15 minutes later! It even arrives in my inbox as an \"FW: Wi-Fi\". It basically asks me for the same thing and I very politely tell her that this type of request must be routed through our helpdesk and a ticket needs to be initiated.\n\nShe sends me another email stating that \"helpdesk@domain.com\" is not working, can't you just give me the password?\". This is a big no-no because last time someone had the password, it somehow made it all around the building and the wireless was basically unusable so we have a policy of users bringing the device to IT and we'll input the password for you.\n\nOf course, after she tells me our dedicated email address is not working, I do a quick test ticket and it works. What are you on a lady? I reply to her email telling her the email address works and to submit a ticket. \n\nShe calls me 2 minutes later and the conversation went something like this:\n\n$User: \"This is not working, every time I copy and paste helpdesk@domain.com into my browser it sends me to a Google Search Page\". \n\n$Me: *u wut m8?* Ma'am, that's an email address, you are supposed to send an email to the ticket.\n\n$User: What?

This story takes place in the mid '90s, when I was creating the first website for a multi-national company. The company manufactured business-oriented electronic products.\n\nThe project was considered somewhat experimental and my boss was excited when he was able to secure one of the company's VPs to officially launch the site. It would be a photoshoot for the internal company magazine. My boss warned me that the VP was not very technical, and asked me to make it as easy as possible.The VP was considered so technically inept it was rumored he got his secretary to print out emails for him.\n\nI did the following:\n\n* I decided to use my boss's computer for the event, as he had a Mac\n* I closed all the other applications\n* I set the browser homepage to blank, restarted it to the blank screen, then set the homepage to the company website (which of course was already quietly live)\n* I full-screened the browser\n* I positioned the mouse cursor over the 'home' button\n\nThat should have done it, right? Everything was in order. The VP had to do just one small thing - push the single button on the mouse - and the blank screen would be filled with the company's homepage.\n\nThe VP came, sat down, posed for some photos, and was instructed to press the mouse button. He pressed the mouse, several times: \"It's not working!\"\n\nIt fell on me to explain to the befuddled and flustered VP that only the top 1/3 of the mouse was a button, and that he needed to press on that part of the mouse to make it work.",

        "text": "HT to /u/inevitablehorror for his CMOS battery story, which after reading, sent me musing a few years into the archives to recall my first encounter with this type of hardware issue. So I thought I’d share. First post; lurks often.\n\nBack in undergrad, I worked the university’s ISP/Academic HW/SW front desk in the on-campus retail store which meant I made sales, did Tier 1 T-Shooting, and did repair intake for the mysterious nerds with the carts. I was fairly plugged in for an art school student, and eventually I roped in my techie friend from the art school to work there, too.\n\nSo around that time, the Bondi Blue iMacs (G3/OS 9) were dropping like flies and the University was procuring G5s in all their labs to replace any of these old dinosaurs still remaining.  Like most students, I’d already upgraded my personal tech to a PowerBook with sweet nvidia GPU (128 MB!) &amp; PPC G4 processor. But to take a step further, my friend and I had repurposed our old G3s as DynDNS-registered home servers which we’d tinker with between classes or while waiting for time-consuming scanning or render jobs to run on our primary machines.\n\nBetween us the epic boasting battle of “longest uptime vs. new unique services” or “hey check out this new tool I found” was alive and kicking. We were well-humored and encouraged by some of the older sage folks on the #macos IRC channel who in hindsight probably got a kick out of our newbie shenanigans and pathway towards discovery.  \n\nSuffice to say, once I took a dive down that UNIX rabbit hole, one dev machine just wasn’t enough!  (As a side note: I’d already too quickly lost my shell access privileges to my friend’s dev machine for pranking.  Jumping 10 years forward where I’m in infosec, and he’s in engineering; I’ve learned that some folks just don’t find it funny when you benignly root their machine, traverse laterally, and schedule wacky cron jobs such that they are lead to believe for months that their computers are having conversations with each other in the middle of the night.)\n\nBut I was a broke student, and ended up getting my kicks researching what I could do next - if and when I ever had another box to setup.\n\nSo late-spring at the ISP, I get wind of an academic tech surplus firesale by a third party and I manage to keep it under the hush for weeks.  If there was technology gold, I needed a head start because I had competition.\n\nSo the day finally arrives. I get to the warehouse in the first hour and make a beeline for the pile of dusty old Bondi blues.  My friend is already there squatting next to a pile of about 6 iMacs, and fiddling with the power on one. I see that 3 are already booted. Damnit dude. You knew there was a fire sale and you didn’t tell me?! \n\nSo I start rummaging through the clutter of peripherals to dig out the last couple of power cables. I plug ‘em in and listen for POST. Boom, sure enough, one of them won’t even power on.  Now these Macs are priced at $150 bucks a pop, and between us we’ve $25 bucks to our names. We both knew where this was going.\n\nThroughout that semester I’d encountered this interesting “no power” scenario with a handful of Bondi Blues &amp; Aquas, starting first with my home computer and later seen in the art school labs. First symptom: the system would lose track of the date with each power cycle.  Then, after a few months of this it would fail to power on.  \n\nHardware take apart on these colorful little gumdrops is quite intricate and tends to be viewed per the eye of the beholder as either rewarding, intimidating, or just not fucking worth it. \n\nFrom the vantage of the help desk, I was prohibited from queueing these iMacs for intake if hardware issues were exhibited. Despite my knowledge and eagerness, the labor fee of $150 plus CMOS part wasn’t worth it for the enduser nor was it covered by manufacturers warranty at this stage.\n\nAfter a few more minutes of fiddling, with a knowing smirk my friend rushes off to find a person in charge.  Moments later, I hear him chattering triaging jargon at a million miles a minute as they approach. POC takes a look at the pile of iMacs, 4 powered on, 2 powered off.  He crouches down to try the power button on the two. Nothing happens.  He tries again. Same result of course. He walks off to get someone else in charge.  They come back and stand around with their arms crossed.\n\n“You kids want these for parts? $10 bucks.”\n\nBest day ever. We pay up, waddle out with our haul and beeline for the off-campus tech store.  2 CMOS batteries, $5 each.  An evening of fiddling with layers of fussy seams and plastic clips, I insert the battery, and boom!\n\nPOST.  \n\nPower on Self Test; the sweetest sound in the world. Even sweeter as I beat my friend to the jump...  Minutes later POST chimes from his machine, but by then I was absorbed with what I’d do next - install the Darwin 3 source code.\n\nThat evening I get to my first time compiling Darwin from source and for the rest of the summer I learn UNIX tradecraft: run levels, native service provisioning; porting, compiling and installing the libraries, services and utilities which on my other Bondi I took for granted via Mac OS X 10.4 divvied up shell access.\n\nIt was such fun.  Best summer ever. Best tech fail ever. A win all around.\n",

I'm a bit of a newb home enthusiast, so sometimes I make silly mistakes like plugging the VGA-input for a projector... into the output/mirror VGA port. In front of management. \nHowever, I'll save it for another time.\n\n\nOne of the bigger tasks on my plate is migrating from System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) 2007 to 2012. I am by no means lead, but I'm in the enviable boots-on-ground tentative-progress position. I had the bright idea to tidy up the 2012 environment first, as the servers are sluggish on a good day, and worse than stationary on a bad one. Spoiler: the ratio of good days to bad is way, way off what you'd want when working in it. It reminds me of my EvE Online days, by which I mean you find ways to pass time while you wait for something to happen.\n\nOne of the errors popping up a lot was (apologies for lack of detail, it's been a while since this started) Advisor Http module cannot parse certificate. I followed this back over an afternoon to the OpsMgr Azure connector, where Azure takes your management server(s) data and gives you a report on how well they're doing. \nI assume so at least, because I never got it working and that's what it says on the tin.\n\nI pass it to the man in charge, let's call him Carlos for fun. Carlos says: \"I know of no need for such a thing! Ditch it, and we'll do that by deleting the relevant servers from the pool of Advisor clients.\"\n\n\nTime passes. Other projects pull attention for a while. Coming back to SCOM, I see there are some different errors... $server can't activate Advisor module, OpsMgr Advisor connector is trying to post data and timing out, no response received from Advisor in xx minutes, that sort of thing. And if this was once a day, I could maybe live with it. But this was an error that I saw every single time I opened the event log. And that, friends, is no way to live. So I decided the Advisor must die.\n\nBenefit of hindsight #1: I'm not here to make decisions. \n\nSo I consulted the Oracle. I found some info. I consulted some more. I got incredibly frustrated with MacroHard's desire to name all products the same damn thing, as it meant any Schmoogle search with a specific enough query returns results for the wrong product, because it's either got the same name or enough posts were made by people with mutual interests in the non-diverse product or SCOM insulted it's mother, who knows. \n\nBut I eventually pulled together a plan to remove the whole module, and take with it the errors and config churn that was surely slowing down the servers to their crawl.\n\nThis is where it starts to backslide.\n\n\nOne sunny morning, I log on early and think to myself: \"CC, you have the whole day and everything is quiet. Let's have a crack at fixing SCOM and I can go back to drinking coffee and watching the agent installer fail repeatedly, but slightly faster each time.\"\n\nAnd so I put on my \"I'm with Kevin\" shirt and started down the article checklist.\n\nBenefit of hindsight #2: When making changes to a production environment, do a dry run before you crack open a cold script and fire&amp;forget. Write down what you'll be doing. Read it out loud, make a PowerPoint and present it to your rubber duck, it doesn't matter; just speak it out loud and know your demons.\n\nStep 1: Make a new pack and rules to disable Advisor re-downloading itself as you delete it. Seems obvious.\n\nStep 2: Debate the merits of creating a script, then decide to do it manually given all the warnings and disclaimers that scripts are an own-your-risk approach.\n\nStep 3: Start deleting the packs containing the Advisor config and information. Deleting each one takes a couple of minutes, but we're cooking with oil and it's not even working hours yet.\n\nStep 4: Tab out to check something while it's working, and reflexively open the ticket desk.\n\nLeading to a moment. That moment. You know the one. You see the tiny crack in the wall appear, you hear the sound of squealing brakes nearby, you watch the nudged glass go from standing juuust on the edge to gently, gracefully, slowly falling. And you know, you just know whats about to happen.\n\n\nTickets: 4. \nSystem Center failure: unloaded rule. \nSystem Center failure: unloaded rule. \nSystem Center failure: unloaded rule. \nSystem Center failure: unloaded rule. \n\nI wonder what SCOM is doing. Let's have a look at monitori-... Why are all [over 1000] of the agents are gray?\n\nSidenote: For the blissfully uninitiated, SCOM works by contacting the host computer it's monitoring. This then sends back to the managing server data like performance, usage, status, etc. It can either do that by agentless polling or by installing an agent that runs as some sort of flimsy service. I assume the difference is that if you have a network outage/interruption, an agent gathers data regardless and waits to restore the connection, where agentless would just sigh and take a seat. If the management server can't get a response, the agent placeholder in SCOM changes from happy and green to sad and gray. One, or a handful, being gray is not an issue, it's maintenance. All of them though... \n\nTab back and refresh.\n7 tickets.\n\nRefresh.\n12 tickets.\n\nRefresh.\n15 tickets.\n\nThe glass is falling, the dam is breaking and I'm turning to see the car about to hit me.\n\n2 minutes and some bile later, we're at 38 tickets, and even end-users are sending in tickets saying \"ooh ooh ahh aah tickets make angry\", or words to the effect of, anyway.\n\nThe Batphone gets picked up and the call gets made. Somebody's coming in and will be here soon. \n\nI'd like to say that hiding the evidence wasn't my first reaction, but I'm a guilty character, so the temporary overrides are first to go. Cant find a way to undelete those packs though... On the advice of the phone I get the go ahead to restart all the management servers \"Yes! Go now!\"\n\nAnd that does exactly nothing except change the boot time.\nEverything I can think of to fix it, which admittedly is a short list, does nothing. \n\n$coworker arrives. I check the databases in case something fell over - wouldn't be the first time. No such joy.\nAt 60 tickets I stop refreshing the helpdesk. \nCoworker takes charge, picks up the user tickets and reassures them it's not their precious babies, it's a false alarm.\nMacroHard are next up on our to-try, and we wait an agonising 2 hours to get a callback.\n\nMeanwhile, I hit the logs. Apparently 1 rule somewhere is not loading correctly, please refer to the specific error next to this one. Oh, this one that says \"the description for this error cannot be found\"? Great... I track down the rule eventually and disable it. Nothing happens. I'm not sure what I was expecting. The Oracle doesn't really help me either, true to form for this product.\n\n\nI was meant to take a break hours ago and had just been riding a wave of fear and adrenaline since then. Giving up, I admit defeat and we wait out MacroHard. \n\n\nIt's been 2 hours and I've heard nothing, watching the business IM for Carlos and Coworker click from Available to Busy to Away for 5 minutes to On the Phone and back to Available. \nPurgatory on Earth, I tell you.\n\nI open up a console to see how it's doing and it's all green. Suddenly a message pops up from Coworker.\n\"Done\".\nCC: \"I just saw. How did you/they fix it?\"\nCoworker: \"We finished removing the Advisor module.\"\nWords fail me.\n\n\nSo this may really be one of the rare few times where ploughing on might have been the solution. \n\n\n\nApologies for poor formatting, typing on mobile and will review later.",

        "text": "I work an internal corporate level 1 help desk. I don't typically get calls that merit sharing here, but this one I just can't resist.\n\nI'm sure many of us have seen at least one user who leans on the whole \"if it doesn't work, try another hole\" method of hooking up computers and on the whole, that's a fairly reasonable method of making sure everything gets plugged in where it needs to be. Every now and again, though, there are more plugs and ports than they know what to do with and you wind up with a situation like the one I just handled. I'll spare you the 20 minute play-by-play and just cut to the chase.\n\nLong story short, a user called in reporting he is trying to hook up his new desktop and it's not displaying anything so he suspects he hooked something up wrong (credit where credit is due, he was absolutely correct. Things were definitely hooked up wrongly). After trying and failing to work out exactly what was plugged in where before finally breaking down and having him completely disconnect everything and reconnect it from scratch, I managed to determine how he had it:\n\n* Mouse, keyboard, and power for both the desktop and monitor connected correctly (I'd be amazed and probably horrified if he managed to mess up the power connection somehow)\n\n* DisplayPort cable from monitor to desktop (So far so good)\n\n* VGA from monitor to desktop (Marginally understandable, wouldn't be the first time I heard from people hooking up a monitor with multiple cable types)\n\n* Communication on the last one was a bit fuzzy, it was either a USB-A to USB-B cable running from the monitor's USB-B port (why the hell does a monitor need USB-B, I ask?) to one of the desktop's USB-A ports, or a USB-A to USB-B cable running from a USB-A port on the monitor to nowhere in particular and an ethernet cable running from the desktop's NIC and jammed into the monitor's USB-B port. I really hope it was that first case.\n\nOnce we got the cabling sorted out and he booted it up successfully, he went to log in only to get a trust relationship error saying the database didn't have an account for his computer. It was at this point I found out he got this computer 6 months ago and just never set it up...\n\nIt's times like this I have to take a step back and remind myself that while I was spending time building up my familiarity with computers, guys like this were hard at work learning to manage their subordinates and maintain great sales relationships with our customers. Just because the right way is completely intuitive to me doesn't mean it is to a guy who can sell sand to a Nevadan.",

Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**$Selben** - Previously Tier 1 tech support. Now an IT contractor, a bit further into his career.\n\n**$ITLead** - $Selben’s IT lead at this particular company. Source of IT related information.\n\n**$VIP** - Someone important. Company president/VP, or otherwise flagged as “important” person.\n\n**$Zetol** - (Zero Tolerance, let him pick his own nickname.) Software engineer at the company, knows many things!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Selben was working at this temporary location solo while $Soda was off having a baby (well, his wife was, but anyway!). It was a simple phone and local IT support gig while the regular employee was on a long vacation. While the office was large, IT support only consisted of two techs. The rest of the office consisted of software engineers and a couple of VIPs, who were given top priority. $Selben had been at the office for a couple weeks and was nearing the end of his contract, when he got the call.\n\n&gt; $Selben: This is $Selben. How can I help you?\n\n&gt; $VIP: My keyboard software is acting up!\n\n&gt; $Selben: I see. I’m not super familiar with that. What is it called?\n\n$Selben looked around, but the other tech was on lunch, so it was up to him to help the VIP.\n\n&gt; $VIP: It’s called ‘DICTATION MODE’.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay. Let me get connected so I can see.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter struggling for 20 minutes, $Selben was unable to get connected to the VIP and opted to walk over to his office. He shot an email to the other tech, letting him know where he was. The office was two floors up, so he wasn’t 100% abandoning his post.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$VIP showed him the software. When he ran it, a bunch of command prompt windows opened and closed, before displaying a box stating, “Ready, please begin.” $VIP started talking, and the dictation filled the screen quickly. Seeing nothing wrong, $Selben asked what the issue was. It was displaying almost every word he spoke, even correcting itself for mispronounced words. $VIP complained it was slow sometimes, but now it seemed okay.\n\n\nHe closed the window before $Selben could get a good look. Another series of command prompt windows opened, running more tasks, and quickly closed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe ran it several more times, and it appeared to be working flawlessly. $Selben scratched his head.\n\n&gt; $Selben: I’ve never seen software like this. Where did you say you got it, again?\n\n&gt; $VIP: One of the engineers came up with it. $Zetol, I think.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay. I’ll talk with him.\n\n$Selben walked over to the engineer and started explaining the issue. He began to laugh loudly and asked $Selben to follow him. They returned to $VIP’s office, he opened the software once again and turned on $VIP’s speakers.\n\nA disembodied voice came out of the speakers.\n\n&gt; $Voice: Hello $Mr.VIP I am ready to dictate for you, please begin.\n\n&gt; $VIP: The software can talk too?! That’s amazing, but why is it slow?!\n\n&gt; $Voice: Oh, I am sorry $Mr.VIP. All of our agents type over 60WMP, but we are human too.\n\n$Zetol let out a sigh.\n\nThe ‘software’ that $VIP was running was actually an auto-dialed session to connect with a third-party dictation company who would type whatever you said. After the session was closed, they would save the files to an online storage provider. While $VIP had been explained all of this when he first got the software, at one point he had turned off his speakers, so he could no longer hear the agent on the other end of the line, and had forgotten.",

        "text": "I don't know who let it slip. One of them. All are under suspicion. Today is my last day before two weeks holiday. Sometime just after lunch, I literally had a queue of people at my desk.\n\n\"I hear you're going on holiday, and I need you to sign this.\"\n\n\"I hear you're going on holiday, we need to move x and y around, and repatch all the phones.\"\n\n\"I hear you're going on holiday, will my new laptop be finished before you go?\"\n\n\"I hear you're going on holiday, I've got a new starter on Monday.\"\n\nAfter an hour of dealing with these people, explaining that I am only one man, my boss came back from a meeting, and told me to only concentrate on the one task he had given me. He gave me carte blanche to go back to everyone who had an outstanding request and tell them it won't be done until I get back.\n\nMy boss is a good man. He's also signed off another week off just before Easter, even though he's off so leaving no IT cover. \"If this doesn't teach them that they need to let our leave roll over into the new financial year, then nothing will...\"\n\nWe then did have a slight argument about the task he'd set me - updating the asset register so he could pull the figures for next years hardware replacement budget. I was content to just double check all the scrapped machines were marked as scrap, but he was adamant that I had to add all the new ones in as well.\n\nWe literally had a ten minute argument where I just couldn't explain to him that it didn't matter about the new kit, because that wouldn't show up in his query of \"all machines with warranties expiring in 2018\". He was wetting himself that the number of \"active\" machines would be less than it should. Which it would. But that wouldn't matter. All he needs to know is active machines with warranties expiring in 2018.\n\nFinally I got through to him, but I could tell he wasn't happy, so I stayed half an hour and added all the new machines in. That done, he seemed pleased and wished me a happy trip.\n\nSo that's it, two weeks of no tech support. Although my parents will be with us for a week, so I'm guessing they'll bring some problems with them for me to fix.\n\nMe? The most up to date tech I'm taking is a Game Boy Light so I can play Tetris (and possibly Turtles - Fall of the Foot Clan) once the wife has gone to bed. Lots of proper books (I usually read a Kindle at bedtime) and lots of guitar. My 1996 US Strat is back from its re-fret, I usually play short scale guitars, so time to bond with this one. Best wishes all - I'm going to turn myself off and on again.",

        "text": "LTL FTP and all the merry stuff that goes along with it. \n\nGood evening everyone, I would like to tell you a tale of the a time when I was on a small Helpdesk for a big corporation. I have many and perhaps I will add some more soon but for now, this one will have to do. \n\n**Backstory**- It was one of my first \"Real\" IT jobs. I had been on a team that was dedicated to windows xp to 7 migration. ~~Just when~~ Long after Microsoft stopped supporting it. I had gone from a level 1 tech, quickly to level 2, eventually making it to solutions architect/knowledge base analyst and whatever other hat they wanted me to wear. Basically I was the final stop for any and all tickets including ones from the regular ~~helpless~~ Helpdesk. Usually a call comes in, the tier 1 guys will create the ticket, if they can't solve it goes to Tier 2, which acted as team leads as well. If they cannot resolve it, it finally gets sent to me for resolution. \n\n\nSo let us introduce the Characters for this evenings tale.\n\n**$Me** - a newbie to corporate atmosphere but excelled quite nicely on the desk to a role I probably shouldn't have had anyways, but never complained and got things done. \n\n**$Co** - a coworker, my bestfriend, once moving up in the company I was able to bring him aboard. \n\n**$Clueless** - a nice enough lady who called in, but was technically challenged. \n\n**$TL** - The desk's team lead, who forwarded me the ticket. \n\n\nIt was a few years ago now but let me see if I can remember most of the interactions. \n\n&gt;$Co - \"Hey $Me, did you get that ticket that $TL forwarded you?\n\n&gt;$Me - \"No? I didn't know he was forwarding me a ticket, whats the ticket number Ill look it up\"\n\n&gt;$Co gives me the ticket number and I proceed to look over the details\n\n&gt;$Me - \"So she has no sound? Has anyone tried unmuting her?\"\n\n\nThis is important because we had a slew of issues with laptops going out with the mute button activated, therefore common sense said to me lets see if that is whats going on here.\n \n\n&gt;$Co - \"Its a desktop.\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Oh, well that's interesting. It says in the ticket you checked the drivers and they were up to date. What did she have for speakers?\"\n\n&gt;$Co - \"She never had any, I figured she was lying so I sent the ticket up.\"\n\n\nOur desk didn't allow for a tech to work very long on a ticket, I believe it was 5 minutes or more you just move it to the next tier and they can take longer if need be. We had a very high volume of calls so something like this isn't exactly uncommon. Just then $TL stops by my desk. \n\n\n&gt;$TL - \"Hey $Me, I just forward you a ticket. I can't get a straight answer out of this lady she says her sound isn't working yet she never had any speakers and her monitor doesn't have speakers.\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Sure thing, I will call her right now.\"\n\n\nI get the lady on the phone, I can tell by her voice that she is iritated, which again isn't uncommon. Usually tickets make it through a few techs before they reach me. \n\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"Hello?\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Hello $Clueless, My name is $Me. I was told you were having some issues with sound? Do you mind if I remote in and see whats going on?\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"Can you? I've had 5 other people look into this and they can't seem to figure out my issue.\" \n\n\nLooking at the ticket I knew there was only two others that worked on it, both of them being good techs and friends of mine so I just ignored her and remoted in. I tested out a few things, checked the drivers, basically everything the other techs did. I always do that in case they miss something small or look over something, you wouldn't believe the issues I've caught.\n\n\nEverything looks fine, just as I would expect, except there is no sound. So I start asking questions. \n\n\n&gt;$Me - \"It looks like this computer use to have speakers attached to it, what happened to them?\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"I have never had speakers.\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"So when sound came out of the computer, were did it usually come from.\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"My desktop.\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Yes, your desktop, I didn't think you had a laptop?\" \n\n\nI was slightly confused.\n\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"The sound, it comes from my desktop\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"The black tower sitting by your desk?\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"Yes from that!\"\n\n\nNo, it doesn't. It never has, and it never will lady. I have to admit, I put the call on mute, and told $Co and $TL we all got a pretty good laugh about it. I calmly try to explain this to her but she insists that is where the sound came from. \n\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Have you always used just one monitor?\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"Yes, but you guys sent me another one\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"Oh, great, can I get you to plug the other monitor in? Unplug this one and plug in the other one.\"\n\n&gt;$Clueless - \"Sure, one sec.\" ......\"Ok its plugged in and on.\"\n\nI play a test sound and hear it over the headset. She plugged in the wrong monitor when we sent her a second monitor. Why we would send her a second on is beyond me as this lady was a remote user and had no IT help physically near her to help, but that wasn't why I was brought into this mess. \n\n**TL;DR** - Lady thinks sound comes from her Desktop Tower, but had the wrong monitor plugged in. \n\n**Edit 1** - English is hard! Had some typos and formatting. ",

I finally convinced the powers that be that we get a better feature set, more flexibility, and at  lower cost (&gt;15%) by using an off-net SIP trunk from our current cable-company-offering-Fiber that we'll call \"Rainbows\".\n\n[I've loved the service and reliability, and our original sales person who is one of my most favorite sales folks I've ever worked with has moved into management and then into management's management, but she's still very responsive and for a while stewarded our account personally when we got an absolute idiot of an account rep until we could get our account reassigned to someone less...awful.]\n\nAfter coming just short of starting a holy war with sales after the project manager told us one of the items $sales promised wasn't possible (spoiler: it was suddenly possible about 45 minutes after I sent $sales and $sales' supervisor a \"fix this or we walk\") we get to the next challenge. \n\nOne of the features of the service is automatic call rerouting/failover if for some reason the trunk were to go down, our PBX was unavailable, whatever. Among the more old-school/those more comfortable with a tangible physical pair of wires for phone service, this was a critical feature and one that we wanted to have configured and enabled before we cutover service. \n\nProject manager says it should be doable as soon as \"pre-install\" happens, sends over the \"Voice Portal\" users guide and the account number for the new service. The day after our pre-install date: \n\n&gt; *Rainbow Portal:* The account number you entered does not match our records. Account numbers are 9-16 digits. Please try again using the sample bill below for guidance.\n\n&gt; *me (internal):* /sigh\n\n&gt; *me (to project manager):* Hey, here's the error message, what's up?\n\n&gt; *project manager:* Ummm... call support at 888-xxx-xxx\n\n\n\nOk, this is going to be fun. \n\n--Call #1.0--\nPleasantries are exchanged, account number and circuit number are provided. \n\n&gt; *me:* Hi, trying to set up an account for the voice portal so we can configure failover before the service is cutover. \n\n&gt; *support #1:* Oh, this is advanced product support. You need to talk to billing for the portal. Let me find the number for you...try 888-yyy-zzzz. \n\n\n--Call #2.0--\nPleasantries are exchanged\n&gt; *me:* My project manager told me to give support a call about setting up an account to access the voice portal, and support told me to call you.\n\n&gt; *billing #1:* Can I have your account number?\n\n&gt; *me:* Sure... 123456789\n\n&gt; *billing #1:* (uncomfortable silence)\n\n&gt; *billing #1:* Oh, you need to talk to tech support, we don't do anything with the portal. Let me transfer you. \n\n&gt; *me:* Buh...(click, hold music) \n\n--Call #2.5--\nPleasantries are exchanged\n\n&gt; *support #2:* How can I help you? \n\n&gt; *me:* Trying to get access to the voice portal, project manager told me to call support, support told me to call billing, billing transferred me to you. \n\n&gt; *support #2:* What's the account number? \n\n&gt; *me:* 123456789\n\n&gt; *support #2:* (long pause) Ummmmmm....\n\n&gt; *me:* This doesn't sound good. \n\n&gt; *support #2:* Yeah, this looks like it's a fiber account. \n\n&gt; *me:* It is. \n\n&gt; *support #2:* Yeeeeeeeahhhhhhhhh, this is **coax** support, you should have called fiber support. I'm not allowed to touch the account. Let me look up the number you need to call. \n\n&gt; *me (internal):* WhyTF did billing transfer me here when they had the account number? \n\n&gt; *support #2:* Give **fiber** support a call at 877-xxx-xxxx\n\n--Call #3.0--\n\nPleasantries are exchanged, I relay that I've talked to my PM, advanced product support, billing, coax support, and now him. We never even get to the \"asking for the account number\" phase. \n\n&gt; *support #3:* I'm not sure what billing was smoking, but we don't do anything with the portal... that's always been a billing thing. We keep telling them that. Let me transfer you back to billing...\n\n--Call #3.5--\nPleasantries and history exchanged again. \n&gt; *billing #2:* Yeah, you must have been talking to coax billing. They don't know anything. What was the account number again? \n\n&gt; *me:* 123456789\n\n&gt; *billing #2:* Hmmm...I need to look at this. \n\n&gt; (wonderful hold music)\n\n&gt; *billing #2* This account looks really odd... and there's already a portal account associated with it. Want me to delete it? \n\n&gt; *me:* Uh. Deleting seems bad, but since we didn't create it and don't have access to it...sure, I guess? Just to make sure can we confirm that you're looking at account #123456789 and circuit ID 21.ABCC----- before we delete anything?\" \n\n&gt; *billing #2* Yep, that's what I'm looking at.\n\n&gt; *me:* Delete away!\n\n&gt; *billing #2* Ok, that's been deleted give it a couple hours then try it again. You shouldn't have any problems but if you do give us a call at 855-xxx-xxxx.\n\nTime goes by and I try it again... with exactly the same results. \n\n\n--Call #4.0--\nSlightly less pleasant pleasantries \n&gt; *billing #3:* Oh, the account hasn't been installed yet. You can't create an account for the portal until after the  installation has been completed and billing has started.\n\n&gt; *me:* Ugh, Ok. Before I let you go... all I really want to do is set up the automatic forwarding number if the trunk is down. Is that something you can do from your end?\n\n&gt; *billing #3:* I can't but support should be able to, let me transfer you...\n\n--Call #4.5--\nPleasantries with a recap of the conversations thus far and what I'm trying to accomplish. \n\n&gt; *support #4:* I don't think that's something we do, but what's the circuit number? \n\n&gt; *me:* Yeah, the circuit number is 21.ABCC-------\n\n&gt; *support #4:* It doesn't look like that circuit has been installed yet...\n\n&gt; *me:* The equipment is here, link is up, and we're doing test calls, but our cutover date isn't until x\n\n&gt; *support #4:* Really? You're able to do test calls?\n\n&gt; *me:* Yep, everything's working quite wonderfully so far, actually, except for the failover. \n\n&gt; *support #4:* That's....interesting....unfortunately I can't do anything until the circuit is installed. You might want to try asking your project manager or calling billing, either of them should be able to take care of it. Would you like me to get you the number?\n\n&gt; *me:* (dejected sigh). That's ok, I have the number. Thanks for your help. \n\n\nOur project manager was a vacuum of knowledge on the subject and at this point I just gave up and deflected questions about the failover status until after cutover happened. 24 hours after cutover, I was able to create the portal account, set up the failover, and then do what I was least looking forward to: Force the circuit down in production and pray that calls wound up where we sent them. \n\nIt worked. \n\nIt recovered. \n\n[Edited to fix call numbering. Whoops.]",

        "text": "Years ago, my grandfather obtained one of those classic “business/school” tier computers that were sold off after a local university updated all of their equipment. Being that my grandfather only plays solitaire and the occasional venture into facebook, this Vista machine was more than enough for his needs.\n\nIt operated just fine for several months until he left me a voicemail that stated, according to him, “it just didn’t”.\nWhen I called him back I asked if he could provide a bit more information, the conversation went something like this:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;Me: So can tell me anything you noticed, anything weird?\n\n\n&gt;Grandpa: Well, I already talked $Grandma, as well as $YourUncle, $YourCousin, and $FriendlyNeighbor,  when I had them over and they all said I was reading the wrong thing and didn’t know what I was talking about\n\n\n&gt;Me: What do you mean?\n\n\n&gt;Grandpa: I thought I noticed this…uh..message..thing…that said I needed a new battery, and everyone I asked said my computer doesn’t need batteries because it’s a desk one (trails off…) anyway, I still got things to click on but now the screens all dark.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI told him I would take a look. I knew it wasn’t something as simple as a turn it off and turn it on again or that it was unplugged, as my grandfather may be elderly, but he damn near managed to set up his new modem all on his own before, and he would have checked all of that before calling me. \n\nBy the sounds of it, it seemed like this was a CMOS battery failure and windows lost its activation code.\nI brought along a replacement I happened to have in a junk drawer.\n\nSure enough, the CMOS battery went bad, and after he shut it down, his PC lost his windows activation and the year and date was set to ~~something like November of 1492~~ January of 1601. \n\nWith the case apart, I showed him how the battery was installed, and he had a bunch of questions about what stuff was and what it did. \n\nI explained his PC does have a small battery just like his watch that allows it to remember small information like windows knowing you didn’t steal it^1 (describing the activation code as basically a “receipt”), how to turn on correctly, and making sure it knows we aren’t still in the colonial period when you turn it off.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT**^1- *As people have pointed out in the comments, windows reports itself non genuine as it cannot verify certificates with the authentication servers if the internal time is way off. I am clarifying this as reading TFTS is  a great way to learn about tech and don't want to mislead anyone.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMore importantly, I let him know that he was right – he did need a battery. I don't think I've ever seen him smile so wide as he ran out of the room to tell my grandmother that he was right about the computer.\n",

We have two KVM switches to plug in, one with VGA interfaces and one with Display Port interfaces. So because the Display Port interfaces from the graphics card are not working she concluded that she has to use VGA graphics from the mainboard. \nSo she plugged everything in (PS/2, LAN and power), but she failed to plug in the VGA adapter. We (the rest of tech support department) have been in another part of our office until she called us in a quite rude manner to help her.\n\nShe complained that those VGA adapters (which were there forever) don't seem to fit and we should give her the prober 9-pin VGA adapter to fit with the VGA adapter on the workstation. We were speechless. We didn't know what she wanted us to do because the VGA adapters were there the whole time. She became more furious because we couldn't help her and began to search our office for a 9-pin VGA adapter.\n\nIn the meantime we started to figure out that there is no VGA port present on the workstation so we plugged everything off and plugged the workstation in to the other KVM switch with Display Port interfaces using the remaining Display Port interface located on the mainboard.\n\nWe found the problem while the customer was standing by with us, we realized that she was confusing the Serial port (RS-232) with VGA.\n\nEnd of story was that the workstation was a warranty case because the microcode update could not be reversed, the workstation was replaced a week later.",

Also, go talk to the students that were in that program last year, they will have a few links to what they did last year that you can use to learn more.\n\n\n10: (With a big smile on his face) Thank you sooo much! \n\n\nAnd then he hugged me! \n\n\nIt was so cute. I'm glad I can inspire some little kids to learn more about IT and have them want to learn and watch me if I fix something for them. It's also just great to know that the kids can help the teachers before they call me. \n\n\nTl;dr: Kid asked to learn more about IT, I gave him some suggestions of where to go to find that info, he hugged me and said thank you.

When people ask about this, it usually means they're trying to do banking or medical stuff across platforms that they really shouldn't be doing.  I.. also like to tell my boss yes to things.   \n\n&gt; Nero: Yes, and no.  The fax server does not, but the mail relay server does.  But I'm challenged to say it's encrypted, it's TLS/SSL\n\nThis went round and round.  It turns out that marketing is doing something.  It's always marketing.  \n\nA short time later, I get this question:\n\n&gt; Boss: What about when the FaxServer is sending to an actual fax number, not an email?\n\n&gt; Nero: No, faxes are not encrypted.\n\nSo...  First, my boss is asking the expert.  He always wants to give absolute answers.  So.. he's asking his expert.  \n\nThis whole exchange screams HIPPA.  I expressed to my boss that the whole series of questions is leaving me uncomfortable.  \n\nE-mail can be sent both over a secure link, and an un-secure link.  SSL/TLS or plaintext.  SMTP happily does both.  Our fax server ~only~ does plaintext, but it goes out through a relay, which ONLY forwards e-mail with SSL/TLS.  But that's not actually encrypted, it's just over a secure tunnel.  That e-mails data is not safe at the start, or end, and is totally open to being forwarded over un-secure channels afterwords.  \n\n... and someone wants to know how if it's secure.  \n\nThe followup question is even more concerning.  Getting an e-mail to the fax server to be sent out, is done over plain TCP.  It then goes out as a fax, on an analog line.  None of that is encrypted.  \n\n&gt; Nero: That are faxes encrypted question leaves me feeling funny too.\n\n&gt; Boss: Me too.  Told Marketing to give me the actual regulation we're being asked to prove against instead of this vague horsehockey. \n\nAnd so we wait.  I expect we'll never hear about this again, until someone gets sued for breaking HIPAA.  Thankfully, that's NOT my department.  ",

It looks like this is an error from somewhere other than our #Platform.\n\n&gt;$User: (not a full screenshot but a snip of initial e-mail they had sent me showing the error message they typed into the ticket, with no new information)\n\nThat's right a SNIP of the initial ticket. Not where they are receiving it, not even a full screenshot. They used the snipping tool to send me a screen shot of the E-mail they had just sent me.\n\n*twitch twitch*\n\n&gt;$Kay: Where are you receiving this error? I do not see any projects in our platform for you? Is this the correct account name \"groupaccount\"? You are currently trying to migrate a group and it's permissions?\n\n&gt;$User: I haven't got to that step yet. I'm still trying to set up $App permission for the group migration. (*$User Attaches screenshot of $Platform home screen, no error message, no project, just our usual project screen*)\n\nThis screenshot is of no use to me at all. At least know I know a general idea of what needs to be fixed. I go over some basic troubleshooting for the issue. Still can't seem to find what is causing this issue. I get a little frustrated at this point as every question I ask they seem to have given up on reading half way through.\n\n&gt;$Kay: Ok, now it's important that you have Global Admin rights to grant this permission.\n\n&gt;$User: I'm using an admin account.\n\n&gt;$Kay: OK, but is it a global admin? does it have full permission to access these groups, read right permission?\n\n&gt;$User: It's an admin account, it has permissions.\n\nI just start requesting screenshots of everything I ask for to confirm they are understanding my questions. (I have no way to remote them unfortunately) eventually, I shoot a message to $M who at this point is most likely getting ready to leave for the day, with the timezone difference they are only around to help in situations for the first 4 hours I'm in.\n\n&gt;$Kay: Hey M, can you take a look at this ticket #666. I have checked everything I can think of. Maybe you have some advice on the ticket.\n\n&gt;$M: Hi Kay. My advice to you is don't trust users.\n\nAt this point, I had been pulling my hair out over this ticket while I had been patiently waiting $M's response. So when I received this from them, I couldn't help but bust out laughing as it was very rare that they would joke. Also sarcastic remarks just sound better when you imagine them with a french accent.\n\n&gt;$M: I'll take a look at it :)\n\n&gt;$Kay: Hahaha, Thanks $M I needed that today. Good advice to remember.\n\nA few minutes go by as I see our ticket system ping with another agent is in the same ticket as me. I check and it's $M taking a look over it.\n\n&gt;$M: First of all, \"stagiaire\" in his E-mail signature is french for Intern.\n\n&gt;$Kay: Ah, this is all starting to make sense.\n\n&gt;$M: I'll speak with our consulting team and have them set up a call with the client. I think they're going to need more than just E-mail troubles shooting to help them in this sort of situation.\n\nI sigh feeling broken that I'm unable to help $User. I had to be missing something simple that could fix the issue. I go back to working the rest of the Friday with this issue haunting me all weekend.\n\nMonday rolls around and I scramble out of bed. Spent possibly way to many hours playing Monster Hunter over the weekend. I make it in to work and sit down to find a new message from $M\n\n&gt;$M: Hi Kay. I spoke with consulting, after all of that time troubleshooting the client was trying to do a permissions migration for files.\n\n&gt;$Kay: Wait...so they were trying to set up a group migration for...files?\n\n&gt;$M: It was file permissions for a group.\n\nSo turns out they wanted to migrate permissions for files FOR a group. Not migrate the entire group with the internal permissions of the group. The $User failed to mention this the entire time I was troubleshooting. I didn't expect much after they assumed sending a snip of the email they had sent me with the error code in it was what I was asking for. \n\nTLDR: Client wants to migrate permissions on files for a group. Tries to migrate the entire group instead, runs into error, sends me error code with no reference, screen shots error code from the e-mail they sent me and resend it to me. Consulting team takes care of it and sets it up for them.",

We did custom builds for home and small business users. One client had just purchased a new system from us - a solid build for home office use with general gaming in mind. I built it, tested it, and showed it to the client when they came to pick it up. A day later we get a call:\n\n&gt;#me: Thanks for calling $PCShop, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;$HU: $me, it's $HU. Looks like we have a problem - the system will not work. I hit the power button, and it just turns on and off.\n\n&gt;$me: (internal - What did you do?) Well - have you checked all connections? Power, keyboard, etc.?\n\n&gt;$HU: Yes - everything is tightened down.\n\n&gt;$me: OK - bring it in and I'll take a look.\n\nThey arrive later that day with the machine and I put it on the bench. First try - boots to XP just fine. Warm boot - good. Cold boot - good. We both shake our heads and decide that $HU needs to use a different power strip, or go straight to the wall.\n\nAn hour later - a call from $HU. Everything connected properly, same result. He even moved the setup to a different room.\n\n&gt;$me: OK. Here's what I will do. I'll come out to your place. If the issue is with the PC, the on-site is on me. If not, you pay for an hour.\n\n$HU agrees, I go out there, and the damn thing wouldn't power up. Started checking all connections - inside and out - nothing loose. I unplugged the mouse and keyboard to make sure they were in the correct ports (PS2) - and booted without them. No issue. Looked at the PS2 connectors - bingo! Two of the pins on the keyboard's connector were bent together so that they both went in the same slot. A little manipulation and the pins were straightened out, reconnected, and we had a fully functional machine.\n\nAnd I had and extra $100 in my pocket, along with an order for a new USB mouse and keyboard.\n\nedit: formatting. first post and all that.",

        "text": "If musically inclined, sing the title like the American Pie song, bonus points will be awarded if you can make up American Pie-style lyrics about email-fail.  \n  \nAnyways, the details, locations, and names are either enhanced or obfuscated for storytelling purposes.  \n  \nHello everyone!  I come to share a new tale after my first intro with [The Jar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/75ycz9/tales_from_desktop_support_the_jar/).    \n  \nWithout further ado here's the cast:  \nBoss - Goes to meetings, handles political stuff, understands the light and dark side of the force, just like ducktape.  \nEVP - Bossman’s boss, holds meetings, makes lists, assigns missions.  \nMe/Tornado- Whirlwind computing associate, network superhero, and surprisingly good looking.  \nBullwinkle - Server admin, both the cause and the solution to the problem.   \nRocky - Email admin, works with the moose.    \nVP of Strange Methods - self-explanatory, makes odd decisions, loves Chinese food.  \n  \nThe places are set, take the scene everyone!  \nCharge!   \n  \nIt all started ~~one dark and stormy night~~ about 9am, with a whisper here, an annoyed user nearby, and a scream of anguish as it crashed for another user.   \nThe problem: Email was randomly dying, it was the yellow exclamation point of… doom!  \n    \nWe had a few reports of email-fail drifting in here and there but it was a patch Tuesday and we network ~~superheros~~ engineers didn’t think anything of it because there’d be internet issues if it was actually a problem with the network and one of the few times it wasn’t DNS!  \n  \nAs if things weren't bad enough already, the outages were maddeningly inconsistent.   \nBroken email wouldn't stay broken - it'd be mysteriously dead for a half day, then just as mysteriously swim back into service.  \nThis was further complicated by frantic staff who would call the helpdesk every few minutes because of it.  \n  \nHelpdesk runs the gamut, is it a:   \nNetwork problem?  \nNo -.-  \nDNS issue?  \nNope! \\^-^  \nSoftware problem?  \nProbably -,-  \nDid windows update break something?  \nMaybe &lt;|&gt;  \nOr an extremely complicated Microsoft problem?  \nAnd now we’re getting ahead of the story, more on that later.  \n  \nWe open with a 9am flood on Thursday of people who can’t access email anymore.  \nMe: Oh my, this is bad, the enterprise + remote systems are inaccessible, this is now the fourth day of being sporadic to totally and completely offline.  \nBoss: Go find the problem!  \n\n-Cue the music! Play the A-Team theme song-    \nImagine my expert and efficient analysis of speed typing and watching Wireshark, testing across 4 different outside networks, a different ISP and with the blue and red providers too. We even tried a magenta network over IPv6 but it still didn’t work.    \n  \nI wrap up and share we have communication to Microsoft, but that's about it, I don’t know what’s going on after we hit their servers, but it looks like an authentication problem.  \n  \nNetworking hands over that report as we see authentication errors because webmail doesn’t work either.  \n  \nBullwinkle the great clumsy admin of all things servers, promptly ignores everything networking suggests that is causing the problem.  \nAfter lunch, he is pressured by the EVP's to get a solution and eventually comes around to the same conclusion, people cannot authenticate from mail client or to the cloud-managed email system.  \n  \n$Me: Moose! Why didn’t you listen to me 6 hours earlier?   \n  \nOur strange method VP is talking in a meeting ~~why do I smell duck sauce??~~ and shares he had not purchased maintenance/engineering support either, so it takes a glacial eternity lasting about 3 fortnights to get a response from them.  \n     \nOnce a fairly large sum of money is sent to Microsoft, they finally recognize our company name and get on with identifying the issue.   \n    \nI see Support.Microsoft remoting in and starts powershelling this and scripting that on the server. It nearly looks like the movies with all of the code flying across the screen!  \n    \nThere's not much to do as it's 5pm and the non-server team is cleared to go home because the internet works.  \nWe leave Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle to watch Microsoft do magic on the maligned system.  \n-2 hours later-  \nMy phone starts levitating off the desk with the data dump of email it has received.  \nIt’s fixed, yay!  \n  \nSo, what went wrong?   \nRemember how I said it was a complicated Microsoft problem?  \n\nThe error messages to the client were not verbose enough to indicate it was an authentication or server problem, thank you Microsoft!  \nParaphrased error messages in true Microsoft fashion:  \nThere was a problem, now go call your network or system administrator.  \n  \nIt was some sort of configuration error, directory federation cloud sync, combined with an invalid certificate that wiped out the access to email for the week.  \n  \nFun times!    \n\nNext time, \\*read in Jeremy Clarkson's voice*  \nWe have a man who loves T1's.  \nA sales rep who won't tell us anything.  \nAnd a cutover that takes 6 months.

Things *worked*, mostly. Users could login, access files, and do most things, but none of the management tools or extra features.\n\nSo, I agree to a rate, and they think I'll need a week or so to sort this out. I hop in the car and drive the 10 hours (torrential rain in the mountains) and get checked into my hotel in Boston.\n\nThe following morning, I go into the office and meet the folks. I'm assigned to work with Mahhk (spelled \"Mark\") who gives me the admin passwords and locks me in the server room (more on this in another post).\n\nSo I start going through the list of things that aren't running... Checking them all one by one. The common factor between them is that they're all dependent on LDAP for authentication. Ok.. check LDAP... Not running.\n\nSo, I start looking at LDAP. Turns out it was failing due to an old self-signed certificate on the server being corrupt. Now, something like step 14 in the documented upgrade process is to regenerate the self-signed certificates. I do so, and LDAP starts up just fine. The other services? Now that LDAP is running, are quite happy to start.\n\nGlance at my watch: 10:30AM.\n\nI drove for 10 hours, and booked a week in a hotel, to resolve a problem in just over an hour.\n\nAll was not lost though, they had me upgrade the remaining 6 servers (3 in Boston, and 3 spread across the state) so I ended up being there for something like 8 days (got home late on Easter Sunday).\n\nIt was an interesting time.\n\nTL;DR Drove 10 hours (and across an international border) to solve a problem that they couldn't find a solution to for months.

It is now time to use it, since $VP has something to print.  \nSo he tries logging in to the desktop computer but can't remember his credentials, so I use mine, he then proceeds to plug the printer and tries to use it for printing purposes. He can't find it in the list of connected printers, so he tries grabbing the driver from the Internet and is asked for admin privileges to install it. He asks me to put in my credentials, and I dutifully do so, but I'm no admin on the school network so nothing happens...  \n\n\nI then decide that we could try to use my laptop, which is powered on and ready to use. So I get it, plug the USB in, and ... nothing happens, windows does not detect anything. So I think of grabbing the driver on the Internet again, install it and at the end of installation it asks me to plug in the printer, which I do, but it still remains undetected. Puzzled I try an other USB port, just in case, but same result. So I reboot the printer, nothing. I then proceed to check the USB cable, printer side, and while I find it plugged in, it is really hard to unplug it... After more effort than should be necessary, I discover it was plugged in the wrong way, yes an USB-B connector was plugged in the wrong way. \n\n\nI then proceed to print the document, not whithout insulting $VP for his idiocy.",

Pointed the email address to it, and away we went. \n\nEveryone was happy with it for many months. Until **the** meeting. Myself, my boss who was IT Manager and his boss whose title escapes me, but frankly was Head of Time Wasting.\n\nI should note that this was a long time ago and OTRS had only primitive reporting functionality at that point.\n\nMy boss called me into his office where he and his boss are having a meeting. He asked me *\"Can we get better graphs out of OTRS?\"*\n\nI replied *\"No\"* which was a slight fib ... someone had recently released an addon module that did pie charts and all that stuff. But it was REALLY buggy and I didn't have time to mess with it.\n\nThe Head of Time Wasting said *\"Well what good is it then?\"*\n\nMy response: *\"The purpose of helpdesk software is (a) to make it easy for the users to tell us when something is wrong, (b) make it easy for us communicate with the user and (c) to document that communication and the fix of the issue. Giving you pretty graphs to wave around in management meetings is the least important thing a helpdesk software does. The software was free ... it's quite well understood that if you don't like the graphing capacity you just import the data into a spreadsheet and make your own graphs.\"*\n\nI was sent back to my duties. And I really DID say a, b, and c like that. :)\n\nThe company then spent many thousands on a helpdesk software which made REALLY great graphs, and was a pain in the backside for the users and the techs. Which I refused to take responsibility for (claiming to be too busy) so my boss got stuck with it.\n\nPoor bugger ... he was fighting with it still when I left.\n\nEdit - Rather than keep responding to everyone who presumes to judge my work ethic and style based on one short anecdote I'll pop this in here. My boss had been running a spreadsheet to convert the exported data into graphs for the best part of a year. The Head of Time Wasting's issue was that OTRS couldn't produce the graphs natively. \n\n",

A story I read here this morning has jogged my memory. \n\nIn the dim dark ages when I'd transitioned from Operations (Non I.T) into I.T because \"I was good with computers\", I was a lowly Tech/Help Desk/Jack of all Trades Generalist.\n\nI'd been with the company for 5 years or so and done a LOT of things to modernise however our Head Of I.T. (HIT) and their direct sub-ordinate manager (MIT) were based in another state. Now the Head of I.T. was jealously guarded about ensuring that all authority AND expertise came from their state. This would have hilarious results.\n\nUnbeknownst to me as they'd kept it a fairly large secret, one of our sister company sites who had no I.T. at all had their one and only server die a sad death. This large Dell server was not only their File Server (although no AD) but more importantly it apparently had a software routine on it that passed data between their customer (the plant next door) and the RS6000 controlling all of the auto-cranes and conveyors in the warehouse.\n\nIt was significantly impacting operations as all data now had to be hand keyed not only into one system but then the auto-crane system had to also be manually controlled.\n\nApparently the system had been down since the weekend.\n\nThis site was a site I actually had to drive past on the way to work every day.\n\nI get a phone call from MIT on the 4th day of downtime.\n\n&gt; MIT: \"Hi ecbrad, now I don't want to get into a mutual backslapping contest but you're really good with computers\"\n\necbrad: Thanks mate thats nice of you to say. What can I do for you.\n\n&gt; MIT: Well \"sister site\" has a big problem with their server and I'm wondering if you could come out and have a look for us?\n\necbrad: Thinking to myself, wow I get to step up. This will be fun and told him sure I'd head out there right now.\n\n&gt; MIT: Great I'll see you there!\n\necbrad: I'm like what?\n\n&gt; MIT: Rather sheepishly \"yes I've been here since Tuesday with a Dell tech trying to fix it and we've given up.\n\necbrad: Ooookay. I'll see you in 20 minutes (thats how close I was)\n\nIn their hubris and insane desire to ensure they were the control and first point of contact, rather than call me and have me go out for a look, which I could have done on the way to work or on the way home, they'd flown a guy (who had no idea about servers) interstate, put him up for days and waited until the 4th day to give the closest guy a call.\n\nI was astounded, angry and amused all at once.\n\nWhen I got there, I was also introduced to a Dell Tech that had been there for 2 days. Still a little miffed I proceeded to get the run down of what had happened and what had been attempted to fix it. After a 20 minute briefing both the Dell Tech AND MIT left for an 11am flight home. I was on my own with a pretty stressed on-site manager and his staff all asking when it would be fixed. \n\nThe server was a rather large Dell Tower and had 2 HDD's with either no RAID at all or just mirrored (I can't remember that detail). One partition was the OS and the other was Data. Backups were using Dat 3 tapes to an internal drive however the backups hadn't been working for months or more.\n\nAll the Dell Tech did was replace the HDD's whilst MIT spent 3 days trying to get everything else working.\n\nNo one could explain to me what this data transfer routine looked like or how it worked and there was no documentation. The only point of contact was the original developer of the auto software who now lived overseas. Luckily they had his contact number and he was willing to talk to me. They'd actually already spoken to him but they just didn't get what he was saying. He was very frustrated when I got hold of him but he quickly realised I had some semblance of intelligence. This worked out well as he recommended me for a job further down the track!\n\nLong story short:\n\nTurns out the server was also running FTP and the plant next door was transmitting strictly formatted text files to us. The server then had a scheduled job, every minute) that was depositing this file into a share on the RS6000 (AIX) machine. The RS6000 would see that directory had contents, parse the data and proceed to move pallets of product around the warehouse. The scheduled job would also backup/move a copy of the file to another directory for auditing and backup purposes.\n\nWith the exception of the directories, all of this has been lost on the server. So I re-created the FTP, Schedule, Tranmission Batch files etc and by early that afternoon all was now good. Note I also documented the procedure for any potential future poor bugger.\n\nCries of joy from the on-site people and questions of why didn't they call you in the first place?\n\nI just replied with, guys I have no idea but next time you have an issue just give me a call as I live fairly close and drive past every single day.\n\nThe next question was what about all of our data? I said I'd take the old drives and see what I could do but no guarantees. Again to cut a long story short, I plugged those drives into a spare workstation, ran R-Studio on it and let it recover as much data as it could. It took 4 days but at the end R-Studio had recovered 95% of the data much to the delight of both myself AND the other site. Transferred it all to an external HDD and copied it back to their new server.\n\nMy reward for all of this. A curt thanks from the \"other state\" and the resposibility for maintaining both existing sister sites from now on. This would bite me as this site was a 24 hour site and they would call me a LOT at times like 2am for stupid little reasons that had no impact on operations. I started leaving my phone downstairs.",

        "text": "This is from my student worker days, when I worked the evening shift assisting night classes. I'll never forget the entitled professor ($EP) I dealt with one night. I came back from a call and my coworker ($CW) told me about the call I just received.\n\n&gt;$CW: Do you know anything about overhead projectors? A professor just called and asked for one for his room immediately, he was a real jerk about it too.\n\n&gt;$Me: Yeah, we actually don't deal with those. The Media Center handles those, he'll need to call them.\n\n&gt;$CW: Do you think you could call him up in room 123? I really don't want to deal with him again.\n\n$CW was fairly new and I had over a year under my belt doing this so I had no problem showing him how to handle a tough customer. I called the extension for the room.\n\n&gt;$EP: Hello?\n\n&gt;$Me: Yes, I'm from IT. You called about an overhead projector?\n\n&gt;$EP: Well, where is it already? I called you guys 5 minutes ago.\n\n&gt;$Me: Our office actually doesn't have any, you'll need to go down to the Media Center and check one out.\n\n&gt;$EP: I'm not leaving, I have class starting here in a few minutes. One of you guys will need to check it out.\n\n&gt;$Me: Okay, I'll talk to the media center to see what they can do.\n\nI ring them up and speak with an employee ($MCE).\n\n&gt;$Me: I've got a professor demanding an overhead projector. He keeps calling our office for him, and he doesn't seem to understand he needs to go to your office and get it as IT doesn't check things out for other people.\n\n&gt;$MCE: Yep, he'll have to come down here as we don't deliver. Only thing I can suggest is that he take on out of a room that's not in use tonight.\n\nKeep in mind that these three areas, our office, his classroom, and the Media Center, are all in the same building, and on the same floor. Sure, it's a long walk from one end of the building to the other, but it's not like I was asking the guy to walk halfway across campus for something.\n\nI could have told him he needed to check an empty classroom, but just to get him off my back (as I didn't know which rooms were empty that also had overheads) I went ahead and did it myself, since it was in the same building anyway. I hated giving in and appeasing this guy but I also didn't want to deal with him the rest of the night. And I didn't even get a thank you once I delivered it, just a \"Finally!\"",

        "text": "From time to time my techs had to verify asset data by checking them on site, then sending me a list of the assets’ information such as brand, model, serial number, asset tag, etc, because the client sucked at keeping us in the loop about new asset purchases and users were constantly moving stuff around. It was a PITA but there was nothing else we could do.\n\nSo, our (or should I say YOUR) favourite tech, Ted, was tasked with collecting asset information for a specific office that had just moved floors. He does the job, emails me the data and then I tell him he can come back to the office.\n\nI looked at the email the morning after and everything was wrong: I don’t know how it was possible but serials numbers were all wrong! You know that after a while you recognize the serial numbers of specific equipment as they are all similar, like the old Lexmark printers that had 621xxxx and 622xxxx as serial numbers… you just notice the patterns after while. Not Ted.\n\nHonestly, it was such a simple task that I couldn’t wrap my mind around it. I had to sit Ted down in a conference room and tell him, firmly, that I was very worried about his performance, as he could not even complete easy tasks like correctly write down a computer brand, model and serial number. He tried to argue with me and I shut him down quickly.\n\nI was the first to leave that day, Ted and Andy were the last to go home. I was cooking dinner when Andy called me…\n\n&gt;Andy: sorry to bother you at dinner time, I guessed you wanted to hear what happened with Ted\n\n&gt;me: oh no what now\n\n&gt;Andy: after you left he came to my desk and asked me if we had an instruction manual on how to find serial numbers\n\n&gt;me: what?!\n\n&gt;Andy: yep, that’s what I said. He complained that you told him off because he could not write down the correct serial numbers, and said we didn’t teach him how to do it. I told him there is no guide for such a task! Only thing I suggested was that he could look online if he doesn’t find the s/n sticker, as some manufacturers have instructions on how to find them if they are hidden, but what is there to explain?\n\n&gt;me: oh my God…\n\n&gt;Andy: he went on to say that we should write a guide and that it wasn’t fair that you told me he couldn’t do asset verification anymore\n\n&gt;me: you know what Andy, thanks for calling me, I needed some motivation to open a bottle of wine as I’m dining alone tonight! Let’s get drunk and try to forget.\n\nSometimes wine is the only answer.\n",
