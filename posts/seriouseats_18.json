Over 3 pounds of meat is a lot for just a couple of servings, and I have a smaller pressure cooker anyway. \n\nIf I half the recipe however, do I need to adjust the time under pressure? Will this affect the end much? Any help would be awesome!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/8gzhq4/french_vs_chinese_consommés_吊汤_whats_the/",
        "text": "As I'm sure you know, a French consommé is made using some ground up chicken meat together with egg white and a bit of vegetables. Over low heat and a bit of time, it forms a raft on the top of the soup that traps the impurities of the soup.\n\nThe chemistry of what's going on here was frustratingly difficult to Google.  The best I could find was this:\n\n&gt;“The clarification of a consommé is such wonderful biochemistry,” says Roberto Kolter, Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Harvard Medical School and FAS. “You might as well be doing a precipitation of a protein [removing contaminants], since you are using the exact same techniques you would use in the lab.”\n\n&gt;To create a consommé, a rich, intense broth that is at the same time delicate and nearly translucent, you start with a standard soup or stock. What keeps a thick soup thick is the suspension of proteins that are not quite in solution.\n\n&gt;Thinning the soup without losing the flavor involves denaturation, a process in which proteins lose and change their structure, as when you fry an egg.\n\n&gt;By adding egg whites (a water-soluble denatured protein) to a thick soup, “you create networks of denatured proteins that, as they are coming out of solution, trap all the other stuff not in solution like a molecular mesh,” says Kolter. In the process, any impurities in solution get trapped and eventually form into a gel-like scum (called raft) that rises to the top of the soup.\n\n... which's all well and good and deep enough of an understanding for government work.\n\nChinese consommé (specifically the variety from the Shandong province), on the other hand, works a bit differently.  No egg white is added. Instead, it uses just minced chicken.\n\nBut the technique of what happens before you add the minced chicken's quite interesting.  What you do is add a bit of extremely cold stock to some extremely finely minced chicken, and stir in one direction for a bit of time until it forms into a paste.\n\nThis's a common step in a lot of Chinese minced meat dishes - it's what makes a dumpling filling a uniform whole instead of some crumbly mince. What happens is quite similar to sausage making: the stirring helps develop the myocin in the meat, which gives it binding ability.\n\nThe paste is then dipped into boiling stock, letting it cook and then rise to the top.  Skim off the scum, then skim out the chicken breast.\n\nIn a couple tests, the chicken breast that I went through that whole process of stirring into a paste made for a clearer stock than just mindlessly added some more roughly minced sort.\n\nWhat's going on here?  I'd guess that after developing the myocin in the chicken mixture it's more able to bind to the impurities of the stock, but does that make any sense at all?\n\nThanks!",

Because of the defense timing, I'll have to ship it two days ahead of time even with express overnight shipping. What would hold up well but still be festive? I sent her homemade fudge, truffles, caramels and nut brittle for the holidays, so I was hoping to do something different this time round.",

        "text": "It's getting hot again, so the other day I wanted to make iced coffee. I remembered an article I saw last summer about a pour over method that's not only easier, quicker, and cleaner than the soaking method, it's also really good. I also remembered that every time I went to make coffee this way I had to pull up the article to get the proportions and everything right. So I finally made a cheat so I can just enter how much brewed coffee I wanted and it will tell me how much ground coffee, ice, and water to use (I also set it up so I can tell it how much ground coffee I have and it will fill in the other variables). In case you're curious, [here is the article I found, which explains how and why one might make iced coffee this way](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/07/how-to-make-japanese-style-iced-coffee.html)\n\nAnd [here is the cheat sheet I made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1paf7Nj75pvA1bShUkV-X5hgQYBfBHkmuB9fd6isRma4/edit?usp=sharing). It's probably best to copy it to your own drive before editing. Hopefully someone will find it useful.",

        "text": "I've always been curious about... erm... DIY food? You know... like... homemade cheeses (soft and hard, aged and not-aged), soy sauce, chocolate (direct from full-size cacoa beans), pickles, lox, sauerkraut, jerky, vinegar, buttermilk, butter, grinding my own flour, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc...\n\nThe issue I'm having is that most of the dedicated blogs I can find are... uh... let's say... not very scientific. And this may seem like a ridiculous complaint to some of you, but I'm a scientific person (I mean... why else would I consider Serious Eats the best fooding site out there?), and there are a number of things that can turn me off a fooding blog pretty quickly...\n\nIf they don't assume you have your own dairy cow or otherwise have access to *raw* milk (I mean I get that they're pasteurizing it themselves, but I don't have the land or money to own my own dairy cow, so I don't have access to raw milk), then they want you to \"avoid GMOs\" (some day, hopefully while I'm still alive, that fear-mongering will be over and people will stop being proudly, willfully ignorant about GMOs... but for now, it's downright infuriating).\n\nOr they're hawking the \"medical benefits\" of wild bacteria... you know... how they can't *say* that it cures cancer, but they totally know someone who got cancer, started fermenting kombucha, and suddenly their cancer was **gone** *for some mysterious reason* nudge nudge wink wink coughitcurescancercough \"nothing to see here FDA\" (whisper: *but you know it does*).\n\nAnd that's just three things that annoy me. There's a lot more...\n\nNow I know Serious Eats already has posts about raw ingredients, fermentation, etc, but it'd be cool to find a more dedicated-to-raw-homemade-ingredients blog that is nonetheless as scientific in its approach, if not moreso.\n\n(Okay so really... while I'm asking for suggestions, what I'm really saying is that a Serious Eats spin-off/sibling site dedicated to making ingredients n' stuff from scratch would be phenomenal.)",

She said she likes chocolate and peanut butter, so I figure a chocolate peanut butter cake would work fine.\n\nMy current working theory is using /u/thebravetart's chocolate frosting in the middle layers with [peanut butter frosting](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/easy-peanut-butter-frosting-recipe.html). And also adding some peanut butter frosting decorations on the outside.  Not sure if that'll be good enough, though!  \n\nI saw [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/04/peanut-butter-chocolate-mousse-layer-cake-recipe.html), too, but I dunno.
