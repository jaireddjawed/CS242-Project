I read a long time ago.\n\nInitially, there are fears that the contents of the first book were only warmed up, but no later than the middle of the second chapter, it is once again really interesting. Hawking is included in this book in more detail than in the first for a possible solution of the God. He describes the supersymmetry and p-brane theory very plausible. I found especially interesting was the explanation of the extra dimensions that we can finally introduce in about themselves, as well as the associated solution approach to the explanation of dark matter! Stephen Hawking weighs the probability of time travel in an interesting way and gives an outlook on the society of the future. \n\nBut this is perfectly acceptable, because it is a popular book and not everything can be described in simple words. Finally, it should be exciting! The images are very helpful in most cases and Hawkings described much humor actually leaves nothing to be desired!",

We are moving around the sun, and the sun is moving around the galaxy, and the galaxy is moving around the universe. So we have the speed of our rotation around the sun, plus/minus the speed of the sun rotating around the galaxy, plus/minus the galaxy moving around the universe. So... there is that speed, compared to whatever \"stationary\" can be considered. \n\nNow, say another planet had life on it, but their planet was moving either much faster, or much slower... as I was laying in bed last night, it blew my mind considering what impact that may have on the development of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nI don't know if I had a question to ask or a point to make, but I would love to hear what smarter people think.

So I'm an Egyptian journalist based in Beirut, where I cover security issues and the fallout from the Syrian crisis, and I'm an engineering graduate (2009). I had always wanted to study astrophysics since childhood, inspired by the writings of Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman. But unfortunately I did not have the option of studying that in college in the Middle East and so I studied electrical engineering and journalism. I ended up working in the latter because of the dry and unimaginative manner in which we are often taught science here.\n\nI would really love to switch careers to the astrophysics field, which I am passionate about. I earned my BSc in electrical engineering back in 2009 and have worked in journalism since then. \n\nMy question to the awesome folks here is this: what sort of educational path should I take? My understanding is that most US graduate programs for astrophysics are PhDs, and very few actually offer an MSc in astrophysics. I feel like I would need to do at least a master's program to bridge the gap resulting from the fact that my BSc is in engineering and the fact that I did not work in the field since I graduated 5 years ago.\n\nWould love any advice!

This is more an exercise in humility to see if I'm just coming up with crazy hypothesis' that have already been tested, since I'm neither smart or knowledgeable enough to do it myself. So if these have already been tested I would love a link or a place where I can read about it. Also, if this belongs more in r/askscience, let me know.\n\ntl;dr Could photons of light be causing a barrier like air molecules create the \"sound barrier?\" Which in turn could mean a lot of new ideas?\n\nThis idea stems from watching the Cosmos last night, so forgive the armchair astrophysics, I do genuinely want to learn about this.\n\nLight is made out of photons (I think, but essentially some particle)\nCould the reason why whenever an attempt has been made to make something go FTL, that it becomes more massive, be due to the particles of visible and invisible light (naked eye standpoint) essentially crowding around the leading edge of the thing, creating massive resistance on the particle? Like air compresses around the nose of a plane just before it goes super sonic?\n\nIf something could go FTL (let's take the constant aspect out of this), would it then be fast enough to \"beat\" whatever light that could reflect off of it, if at all, essentially \"blocking\" it's own light, rendering it invisible?\n\nIf that's the case, could that be what we \"see\" when we observe dark matter? Just something that is going faster than it's own light?\n\nIf all that is the case, or is possible at least, to go faster than light would require a tremendous amount of energy. Could that be what the Big Bang is? Essentially the \"sonic boom\" of something going faster than light, in turn throwing off particles that are faster than light, while also particles that are not cable of breaking that constant?\n\nIf I'm not understanding some aspect that makes this all not make sense, please educate me. I just thought this was an interesting thought while having coffee this morning, and would like to see if anyone has ever had the same idea, honestly.\n\nI guess what I'm really trying to say is, I have no idea how light works, but would like to.

Would that suggest that energy is growing, or endlessly large?\n\nI understand completely I could be just being silly here, but I'd love if someone could point me in the direction of some literature or theories that could settle my mind on this, rather than point me towards the door out of here. Or point out if I have missed something, and am just being silly.\n\n**TL;DR: I'm searching for a theory or literature that suggests or conflicts that the big bang extruded matter from black holes.**",

I was looking at UK (University of Kentucky) and noticed that they do have an astronomy/physics program in place [here](http://pa.as.uky.edu/physics-and-astronomy-courses). However, I've not seen that mentioned on here or anywhere else as to what the quality of said program is. In the end, I want to get my Ph.D. in astrophysics but I'm not even sure if UK offers that thorough of a program. UK seems like the most realistic prospect for my future as a scientist and as a physicist but if the whole astrophysics thing doesn't takeoff quite as well as I'd hoped then I may just switch to aerospace engineering because I quite enjoy that and feel I know the concepts of it quite well and am very fascinated by the physics of it but doing that instead of astrophysics almost feels like giving up. Anyways, to end a tangent, I was hoping one of you fantastic gentlemen/ladies could give me some advice as for what to do and whether any of you have any experience or knowledge of UK's astrophysics program.

        "text": "Hi, \n\nSo I'm requesting help again. I'll post the lab discussion question and background info + my response thus far. I understand most of it, I just need to find the right facts to support my claim, here goes:\n\n\n**context: lab about finding the distance to Pleiades star Cluster by plotting absolute magnitude vs apparent on two graphs--one  for apparent, one for absolute. Then we overlaid them (one was transparent) and compared the shift).**\n\n\n*How would interstellar reddening affect your results?\n    A) What is interstellar reddening?\n    B) Would all star on your color magnitude diagram be equally    affected?\n\nI define part A as you will see, and state that is will affect results--but don't really get into why. As far as I have gathered, it exists with most star clusters but metallicity rates for Pleiades helps it adhere to the ZAMS better than most even though there is reddening. So would this mean that there is reddening, but it is negligible? Furthermore, I'd say that not every star on the diagram would adhere to this because sometimes clusters appear to have stars in them that may be quite a distance further away, but due to their magnitudes, they appear to align with the others. But how does distance correspond to more reddening, more distance equals more dust to travel through I assume? So I would say there would be some possible outliers. I don't feel I need the internet so much to say that part. I'm, mainly struggling with. The how, and how I can prove it. \n\n\nHere's my go thus far. any comments on redundancy or anything is welcome. I am citing anything in quotes.\n\n\n**“In astronomy, interstellar reddening is a phenomenon associated with interstellar extinction where the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source changes characteristics from that which the object originally emitted. Reddening occurs due to the light scattering off dust and other matter in the interstellar medium. Interstellar reddening is a different phenomenon from redshift, which is the proportional frequency shifts of spectra without distortion” (Extinction (astronomy), Wikipedia).  This basically means that there is obstruction between the observer and the celestial object in question. In addition to dimmer starlight, stellar objects appear redder. This is linked to Rayleigh Scattering. On Earth, Rayleigh Scattering can be attributed to atmospheric extinction. It is directly correlated to absorption of UV light through the ozone, the passage of light through water in the atmosphere, and altitude. It’s what makes the sun appear orange or red at sunset or sunrise. Interstellar reddening can indeed affect the original data and results compiled. Astronomers have found examples of 3D interstellar reddening in the Milky Way galaxy using ultra-violet spectroscopy, x-rays, near infrared, and visible observations. In regards to the Pleiades cluster examined in this investigation, interstellar reddening did affect out our result.**\n\n\nThanks a million!!",

        "text": "Hi, for my 2nd year astronomy project I have the opportunity to make observations at the Isaac Newton telescope. It is a quite large 2.54 meter telescope build in 1984, only the wide field camera in the prime focus is available for observations. The project should take about 3 to 5 hours of telescope time on a single night or spread out over several nights.\nAnything is possible... observations from previous groups included exoplanets, RR Lyrea, supernovae, Haumea and clusters of galaxies.",

        "text": "I have not come anywhere close to having a full understanding of astrophysics. But as a curious human and with the hopes of being 'better' and increasing my knowledge I have been able to crudely paint myself a picture of the nature of existence. It is with that same curiosity that I wonder what others who have come to such knowledge have been able to deduce, and what can be learned from those similarities and differences. How does your knowledge of physics/astrophysics relate to your understanding or metaphysics?\n\nI think it would be unfair to ask for a response without giving my explanation so here is a nutshell and i will elaborate if anything is unclear, simply put: \n\n-Everything is connected. Singularity (like that at the center of our sun, SMBH... and everything in one way or another) is typologically representative of knowledge, relation, and love. It appears in and effects all things.\n\n-the cause of all existence/our galaxy/all galaxies is (for simplicity sake i will say) dualism- The separation of a whole into opposite components- this is illustrated by both the event horizon side (feminine, Chaos driven, subjective, entropy/anisotropy) of the black hole and the side that emits hawking radiation (masculine, reorganization, objective, enthalpy/isotropy).\n\n-electromagnetism- The driving energy of our planet, our solar system/galexy, and all life conscious to non conscious. Like the heart in your chest or changing weather illustrate my point.\n\n-weak nuclear forces - Force of decay, capable of changing the state of quarks. Much like your stomach changes the state of the things you consume. \n\n-strong NF - \"100 times stronger than electromagnetism\", the heart wants what it wants, but a person has other needs indeed (wink). It also happens that through this our sun has given life to this planet.\n\n-and gravitation- a force which brings things back to center, recollecting/reorganizing them. the basic force required for matter to constitute itself ( atmoic/subatomic, cellular activity, and matter in its pure form before consciousness manifests). They say one shouldn't lie down after eating, I won't tell you what to do, but there is a reason.\n\n** these concepts as well as many others I haven't added here show the nature of all things from galactic to subatomic, and it is only in the past decades that the picture has become clear enough to see. It has been discussed from the Upanishads, ancient Mayan and Babylonian cultures crudely discovered key principles, Kant contributed to Schopenhauers 'the world as will and representation'. artists of all types, and Einstein with the help of those before and after have been filling in blanks. And it is even hard to argue that any dualist idealism did not contribute to overall understanding.  \n\ndo you find these interpretations to be accurate, somewhat accurate or false? why? What is your interpretation of the interactions you see around you?\n\n**I am aware that this might sound like i am Jim Carrey in 'the Number 23' seeing patterns in nothing. Honestly, sometimes I feel insane in this world. But if i have to sound insane to learn something then so be it! I believe the difference is between those who act on such insanity and those who reflect on it. I am contemplative.\n\nThis topic could cause a fuss, perhaps even spark anger in some who believe. All I know is I am trying to learn, and to learn how to be good. Because if I don't know or know how it is more than likely i will fail, statistically speaking. It is with an open mind and open heart that I submit this question to anyone who wishes to discuss the matter. Thank you.",

Making it a mistake with our interpretation? I posit that the Babylonians understood that there was another effecting 'object'. \n-What effect will the SMBH feeding have on our galaxy..our solar system..our sun?(Schwarzschild) \n-and If our Sun has a singularity at its heart much like the SHMB (increased fusion/fission, grav/EM relativistic mass)\n-The sun should be effected more directly? SMBH-sun-earth?Has anyone studies these effects? please help.thanks\n-request links sites that post up to date astrophysics info",
