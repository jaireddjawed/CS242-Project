Then did contractor work on and off for the same museum after I graduated. \n\nI am stuck. \n\nI want to pursue a career in the museum field and have been looking into Masters programs that caters to this; and that I can also do online so that I can work at the same time. My student loans are incredibly high and I had little to no help from my parents with it. so I am paying $615 a month and that was AFTER refinancing from the original $800. \n\nI have had no luck getting an anthropology based job post quarantine. I feel like such a failure especially because I’ve been stuck working in childcare to make ends meet and it’s really lowering my self esteem. \n\nHas anyone had anything luck with getting into the museum field with a BA in anthro? I would really appreciate any tips. I’ve tried emailing people who have jobs that I would love to do one day and asked what path they took educationally and what experiences benefited them to get where they are today but NO ONE has responded back. So feeling a bit lost and hopeless at this point. \n\nAny advice , anecdotes, ANYTHING would be so appreciated. \n\nThank you",

It puts Africans as being a highly separate branch with a difference of 0.205 from everyone else, while for instance representing Europeans and SWANA as only differing by about 0.015.

And I'm trying to reconcile what I had hoped for, with what I have.\n\nFWIW, my background is in History, I've always been impressed with what tidbits I hear the Linguists and the Archeologists have come up with. If I had to say what I had guess/hoped the book would do would be to follow the Indo-European languages, out of the Steppes, and give current best models on how this language format, chariots, and poems about epic warriors stretch from India to Ireland. And it's... implied? But Anthony keeps pulling the camera back to the steppes, and keeping the focus on the region's series of innovations. I don't think we get any further west than... the Middle Danube? We basically leave the Western branch at roughly 2,600BCE, and then our focus goes back to the Steppe to cover the revolution of the Chariot, c.2100BCE.\n\nI'm glad I read it, and if the cards land right and I'm a Middle School History teacher again, I'll integrate some of this, but I just have so many question marks still. I'll definitely mark the area as similar in importance to say, the Ancient Egyptians, and I'm glad the region got a spokesperson, but I have so many questions! I'm sure you can guess many of them, but here's a few:\n\nMy vague prior knowledge is that a PIE version of Germanic came out of Scandinavia, and did just hundreds of years of Migrations, from before the Romans were recording, till after the fall of Rome. Well, how did they get up there? What brought them South?\n\nThe Basques are famously one of the few holdouts. I don't think they're mentioned once?\n\nOk, tell me about the Chariot. Cu Chullainn rides a Chariot. He has a lovely epic poem. Can we connect the dots?\n\nCan someone put a chronology of the British Isles for me? Bell Beaker people built Stonehenge, then PIE Halstatt/Celtic/I know it's messy, then the documented Rome/Withdrawl/AS/Norman? I really hoped this book would have clarified what was going on in British Pre-History. Self-centered, I know, but he repeatedly calls out that he's discussing the roots of English, and goes back to discussing the material culture around the Urals.\n\nWould love to discuss, any and all of this, or getting reading suggestions.",

        "text": "  \n\n**Jesus &amp; the lady who applied costly scent to Him**\n\nOnce, a lady was worshipping Jesus by applying a costly scent to Him. A disciple of Jesus criticized this and stated that the cost of the scent would have been spent for feeding the beggars. Jesus condemned the disciple and accepted her service. \n\nThe reason for such personal service is that she is in the path of Nivrutti (Loving practical service to God). She desires only the Lord and is not interested in the social service. The followers of Nivrutti will even leave the justice for the sake of the Lord (Sarvadharman—Gita).\n\nSuch souls reach the permanent divine abode of the Lord. One cannot compare Jesus with a rich man who is also enjoying a similar service. The rich man is not God and he has to please the Lord. \n\nThe final goal is not his selfish pleasure. In the case of Jesus there is no other God whom he should please. The service done to Jesus protected that lady in this world as well as in the upper world. But the service done to the rich man cannot protect anybody. \n\nOnce a rich man approached Jesus and asked for his future duty in order to enter the Heaven. Jesus told him that he should give away all his money to the beggars. Jesus did not ask him to bring costly scent to be applied to Him. \n\nThe rich man belongs to the level of Pravrutti(obeying justice) and is interested in his personal upliftment and personal enjoyment in the heaven. He is not interested in Lord Jesus. Thus the Pravrutti and Nivrutti should be differentiated. The ignorant people who are unaware of this difference will mistake Jesus to be fond of the application of the scent by the tender hand of a beautiful lady.\n\nThe Lord is the fire of knowledge and any stick will be burnt to ashes. When the Lord comes in the human form, He plays with all the qualities existing in the universe. He created all the qualities only (Yechaiva Sattvikah—Gita) for His divine play meant for the entertainment. The Lord created even Satan.\n\nIn a cinema the role of villain also exists and the actor of that role is also paid. Any quality that is used for the entertainment and pleasure of the Lord is good and sacred. Any quality that is turned towards selfish pleasure and these worldly bonds is bad and impure. The ultimate aim of this universe is only His entertainment. Even Satan is sacred since he is playing his role sincerely by testing the firm faith of the devotees.\n\nYou must hate his attraction for diverting you from the Lord but not the Satan. Jesus told that you should hate the sin but not the sinner. The Lord is beyond qualities because the qualities consist of the subtle body (Gunateetah—Gita). These qualities are tools of His divine play and He is not the subtle body. \n\nTherefore He is not the qualities and is untouched by them. A human being is the subtle body and is controlled by the qualities. He is a tool to the game played by the qualities (Nanyam Gunebhyah—Gita). \n\nThe Lord uses the bad qualities as His mask so that the undeserving devotees do not approach Him for any favors. He is also using these bad qualities to test the firm faith of the sincere devotees. No human being can understand the Human incarnation. Every human being easily misunderstands the Lord in human form.\n\n[Universal Spirituality for World Peace | Shri Datta Swami](http://www.universal-spirituality.org/)\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace",

Band societies have dealt with these issues by assembling several microbands together into macrobands at regular, predetermined gatherings. A macroband may involve 15 or 20 microbands. Anthropologists have calculated that it takes a mating network with a minimum of 200 people to have the necessary potential mates for everyone to find a suitable partner. Macrobands provide mating networks. In some cases, it is evident that two or more macrobands would congregate. In addition to arranging marriages at macroband assemblies, the structure of cooperating families would reorganize. In historic times, most microbands reorganized each year, in part to relieve internal stresses.\n\n&gt;Macroband assemblies occurred during the season when food resources were most abundant. Along the Upper Mississippi Valley, that would have been in the summer, when fish, mussels, waterfowl, and many other riverine foods were readily available. For most of prehistory, people of the Upper Mississippi probably came together annually at geographically distinctive locations, such as the landmark Trempealeau Mountain or at Prairie du Chien, where the Wisconsin River empties into the Mississippi. As microbands congregated into a macroband during the summer, courtships and marriages took place, microbands reorganized, and friendships were renewed. During these warm-season gatherings, with all members of extended families and friends assembled, ceremonies that served to bind the macroband together could be held. The most important of these would have been burial of the dead. In some periods, the bodies or bones of persons who died during the winter were brought to the macroband assembly, where all could be involved in the burial. Participation in funerals is a classic means of paying respect to the dead and maintaining group solidarity among the living.\n\nHowever, I've been able to find little information on the subject.",

Furthermore:\n\nChina’s main governing philosophy is Confucianism, a system based on preserving traditional values of hierarchies. It spread to Korea and Japan and they also became conservative too.\n\nIndia’s caste system and societal structure is extremely rigid as it is extremely hard if not difficult to move up the social ladder.\n\nMiddle-Eastern families value interclan marriage which breeds conservatism as lesser new ideas are added to society within cousin marriages.\n\nIt is said that little changed about societal structure in Southeast Asia from 800-1800.\n\nWhy is conservatism such a valued philosophy in Asia?

The high immigration from non-European regions is growing every year and the birth rate of the immigrants is extremely high in comparison to their host countries.\n\nThis trend is increasing exponentially, and by this point it is neither possible nor preventable that the future of Europe is looking pretty grim. As history tells us, there will always be conflicts and wars, therefore it is inevitable that at some point in the future, a civil war between Europeans and non-Europeans will arise.\n\nThe thing that I fail to understand by the lack of European politicians involvement in this matter is, how are they exactly going to even stand a chance being outnumbered in the world, where Europeans will be vast minority in comparison to the extreme number of non-Europeans in Europe and their ancestors in Asia, Middle-East and Africa.\n\nWe already see mass rape, mass killings and mass gangs roam around in Europe, committed by African and Middle-Eastern immigrants, but also by 2nd and 3rd generation migrants. How exactly is gonna be prevented or stopped if the amount of these people keep increasing to a point of no return?\n\nWhen you are already losing a battle against them, and they only make up 3-6 % of the total population, how on the earth are you going to stop them when you become a minority in your own country? Seems to me that Europeans are a lost cause, not only because of the immigration, but because of all the things combined.\n\nThis is just a snippet among many other things I could write, but this is on my mind right now and I would like someone to enlighten me and tell me if I am wrong and how.

From what i read until now it began to be important because the man wanted to know that the children that his wife gave birth to were his as this was also important for inheritance. But i thought of another reason. When agriculture started, i imagined it required some manpower. Let's imagine a culture in which just men owned property(lands and tools). A man needed the manpower to do agriculture. But other men had their own fields so they would not want to work on his field( i know that the example is exagerrated, this just helps me ask my question). So he used his children. Let's suppose that his wife had sex with another man and that man's wife did not give birth to children. Man 2 really needs manpower for his fields and he wants the children that wife1 gave birth to. So they quarreled. And because that culture wanted to avoid such scenarios, the fidelity of the wife became important because in that way there would not be another man to come and claim his children( children that represented \" economic asset\" let's say). I know that my example is bad( as marriage and ideas like fidelity and paternity evolved alongside each other, not in stages), but i hope that this example illustrated my clarified my question. To summarize: Did marital fidelity become a important thing so that another man could not come and claim another man's children? Thank you for reading this!",

This would include descriptions of the types/purposes of various structures (within a cultural/geographic context), why/when/how they are built, when/why/how they are demolished. Who decides these things, and how are the materials and labor allocated, accounted for, and expended? What interpersonal interactions and relationships are important to the construction and/or demolition of a given structure?\n\nMore peripherally, I'm also interested in inter-structure relationships, but I'm mostly interested in the structures themselves, and the cultural moors surrounding them.\n\nAny culture focus would be fine, but I'd especially appreciate literature with a focus on nomadic cultures and sedentary cultures in desert and mountain environments.\n\nThanks!",

Is cultural development the biggest determining factor to human survival in an area as opposed to physical adaptations? I see in the genealogical studies of ethnic groups that they are often the result of an amalgamation of people who migrate to considerably different areas than where they are from originally and are still able to survive in them.",
