        "text": "It's hard for me to think about it, since I study in South America, but my country is heavily influenced by both Archaeology from North America and Europe. (Even though we do study South American Archaeologists as well)\n\nI'm a Ph.D. archaeology student, and the lack of mentions regarding Archaeology practitioners outside this axis bothers me a lot.\nI do find researchers from all over the world, but all of them somehow mostly perpetuated the archaeology theory as we find on a Trigger's book. An Archaeologist born in China and who studied solely on China (just as example, please I want to hear about different countries and experiences!!) What is like?\n\nIt's strange for me accepting the sole concept of \"modern\" Archaeology theory derives for example, Binford and Clarke's processualism and Hodder's post-processualism and so go on.\n\nSo, if you studied Archaeology outside the occidental side, What it was like? Do the Occidental Side really influenced your country researches? Is it different? What authors do you think we should know about?\n\nSorry for this somehow unkind and polarized question, but I do want to expand my horizons a bit. Let's say I'm kinda biased towards Edward Said's works atm.\n\ninb4: I asked it before in /r/archaeology, but I think this board has more views, maybe?",

How do China and Russia, who don't seemed quite defined by either of these categories, factor into this equation?\n\nIt seems at the very least that the etiology is different.  At least in the US, there is a loss - perceived or real - by dominant members of society.  In post-colonial countries, there is a solidarity stemming from antimony towards colonizers on the part of non-dominant groups.\n\nI'm just spinning my wheels right now.  I'd appreciate any answers or some good books to dive into.  I've posted in here before, and as before, I'm trying to piece together models and trajectories that I can apply towards China for my own personal study.\n\nThanks for your time!  ",

He writes: “The sharks patrolled the deeper waters here for eons, but in the past the indigenous people...weren't swimmers or surfers, and there was no tradition of using the ocean beyond the waist-deep intertidal zone.” (p. 62)\n\nMy sense is that through much of north and south America, Australia, Africa, and much of Asia, it was a similar story: Ocean immersion, either for recreation or food gathering, was rare.\n\nIf someone can comment on a tangential issue, it seems the recorded history of shark attack is scanty in large part because peoples did not enter the ocean the same way we do now, with surfers and snorkelers venturing 100s of yards out to sea.  Possibly the vast majority of shark attack victims were people who fell off boats/canoes.   \n\nThis state of affairs, if correct, would leave a far different record of human-animal conflict than was/is the case with our (well documented) history with tigers and crocodiles.  Peoples had no choice but to enter forests and approach rivers for necessity.  Recurring result: animal attack.\n\n(Anyone have any historical information of sharks being a problem for a culture say pre-1800? [In Hawaii our data is very slim.])",

Of course, body fashion and norms aren't biological, and aren't purely sexual. Any woman may sculpt her eyebrows for any reason, and the memetic interpretation with the inclusion of Fisherian runaway is that \"sculpted eyebrows\" becomes a meme, which evolves as people participate in the behavior, producing highly stylized eyebrows, eyebrow concept art, and unaesthetic exaggerations of the meme you might find on the \"awful eyebrows\" subreddit.\n\nThe term \"body fashion\" is partly me expressing a negative attitude in my private language about an unclear category of \"body norms\", or the whole category perhaps. I also want to illuminate the role of media, social attitudes, and other spectacular things that reduce our physical form to clothes that can go in and out of style, be disapproved, and be subject to this Fisherian runaway I observe. I picked eyebrows because it's easy to imagine \"awful eyebrows\" to your taste, but things more difficult to change like body type, height, and such can be subject to runaway.\n\nThis is a mental model I developed in an environment where it's difficult to avoid images of \"body fashion\" the media puts forward, while trying to remain critical and analytical about it, and if it's a poor model—and especially if there's a better one—I'd like to improve my mental world by knowing about it.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "[In this TED Talk by neurologist Mariano Sigman](https://www.ted.com/talks/mariano_sigman_your_words_may_predict_your_future_mental_health/transcript), Sigman makes this grand claim based off of Julian Jayne's theory of conciousness: That the kind of first-person self-awareness we're used to now, was something that had to build itself up continuously over time in literature. Personally I think Jayne's theory is BS but Sigman's computational work finds a linear trend throughout the Bible, using an algorithm mapping words by their semantic neighborhood. He says at 7:14 in the video:\n\n&gt;[W]hat we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on, these books get closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection.\n\n&gt;And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition. **So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection.**\n\n&gt;So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in \"The Confessions of Saint Augustine,\" about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.\n\nWhy was the Bible written like this? Any good sources on this?\n\nHere is his study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449397/",

However I don't have the historic knowledge about it so I'm not sure about those different people. \n\nFurthermore I'd like to know more about the neolithic process in europe. Was it a continuous process or rather arhythmic? Was it a demic diffusion or a cultural diffusion and what was the role of the mesolithic people?\nWhat role did the climatic change and the change in the environment play and can you say it was a revolution?\n\nThe region I'm talking about is europe.
