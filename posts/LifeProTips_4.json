As I grew older and began learning how to present myself in a better light as a result of my career, I discovered that smiling also improves your likability and creates a better first impression, as most people form this in the first few seconds of meeting. To incorporate the characteristics of a genuine smile, follow these steps:\n\n1. Relax your face and take a deep breath. ü´Å\n2. Think of something that makes you happy. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n3. Lift your cheeks and part your lips slightly. üòÄ\n4. Squint your eyes a little. üòÜ\n\nPractice in front of a mirror and use it in social situations, starting with casual/less formal or lower-stakes situations before moving on to more important ones.\nPro tip: Practice moving your lips to the same position (find your sweet spot) every time to ensure a consistent quality of smile. When you know you look your best in the first few seconds, it automatically boosts your confidence.\nBonus points if you keep a happy image in mind each time.\nNote: If the first impression is important, such as in an interview, client meeting, or when approaching someone for the first time, check (and adjust if needed) your smile using your selfie camera. Then, shrug off any nervousness, knowing that you did your best for that interaction.\n\nThank you for listening.",

I am from a third world country(uganda to be specific) and its really hard to find jobs.\n\nI could do casual jobs that pay 3$ per day but its not worth it as that 3$ includes food costs and transport and i would only manage to save like 1$ in the end and that work is too demanding and have school everyday. I am tech survey but i am just starting to learn valuable skills that could help me get good IT jobs in the future.\n\nI just began learning java script and want to get good at python by year end. As of now i dont have any in demand IT skills that could land me a job outright so i am looking to do something that will instantly get me earning within a month as i am struggling to keep up with the high cost of living since my university is in the city centre so things are really expensive and i have had to sleep hungry on some nights which is hindering my academics because some times i am unmotivated to do assignments or make research.\n\nI have good command of the english language ,basic computer skills with a basic understanding of  \nmicrosoft applications ie access, excel, powerpoint, access, word etc, access to fairly fast wifi 24/7(i reside in the university dormitory so we have free access to the university wifi)and i have a laptop. I also only do evening classes so that means i have a lot of free time during the day.\n\nPlease someone help advise and any tips or links to low barrier remote IT jobs that dont take long to learn.

        "text": "\nWe met in summer 2019. We quickly ‚Äúfell in love‚Äù- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt ‚Äúhead over heels‚Äù and she (34f) felt the same. She‚Äôs the most naturally beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other‚Äôs families and things were getting serious‚Äîsaying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and making plans for our shared future‚Äîright until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I‚Äôm ‚Äúas handsome as ever‚Äù, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then‚Äî she had a boyfriend and we shouldn‚Äôt have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn‚Äôt want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that ‚Äúwas music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‚Äòlong game‚Äô‚Äù because she wasn‚Äôt single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she ‚Äúdoes love me, but is scared.‚Äù After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt have done that‚Äù) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. \n\nI got routinely hurt‚Äîreally badly‚Äîby her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As an example, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would disagree with me in front of everyone. I also caught her in a lie‚Äîwe had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to see you tonight‚Äù which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she double booked herself, but ‚Äúreally wasn‚Äôt feeling well.‚Äù I then went ‚Äúno contact‚Äù in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she realized over the last couple of months how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, more critical of me than normal (I couldn‚Äôt do anything right; making the bed, cooking, she told me I was ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and ‚Äúcringey‚Äù in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner‚Äîusually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts‚Äîcooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù ‚Äîshe would say things like ‚ÄúI hope our kids have your face,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to move in with you,‚Äù‚ÄùI love you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm crazy about you‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so important to me.‚Äù This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she‚Äôs now in a ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationship and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel right about seeing each other one-on-one.‚Äù I told her I still love her, she simply said that was ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù and she said she wanted me to leave her alone. The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI see their all her family now follow him on social media, which is more than I ever got. He has eclipsed me and I can‚Äôt get over it. I feel worthless and the anxiety of them being together and me unable to do anything about it is horrible, unbearable. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, please share because I‚Äôm at a loss and can‚Äôt get over it. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "IWTL how to smile to improve the quality of my photos. As I grew older and began learning how to present myself in a better light as a result of my career, I discovered that smiling also improves your likability and creates a better first impression, as most people form this in the first few seconds of meeting. To incorporate the characteristics of a genuine smile, follow these steps:\n\n1. Relax your face and take a deep breath. ü´Å\n2. Think of something that makes you happy. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n3. Lift your cheeks and part your lips slightly. üòÄ\n4. Squint your eyes a little. üòÜ\n\nPractice in front of a mirror and use it in social situations, starting with casual/less formal or lower-stakes situations before moving on to more important ones.\nPro tip: Practice moving your lips to the same position (find your sweet spot) every time to ensure a consistent quality of smile. When you know you look your best in the first few seconds, it automatically boosts your confidence.\nBonus points if you keep a happy image in mind each time.\nNote: If the first impression is important, such as in an interview, client meeting, or when approaching someone for the first time, check (and adjust if needed) your smile using your selfie camera. Then, shrug off any nervousness, knowing that you did your best for that interaction.\n\nThank you for listening.",

If you could do an extra 30 min-1h of driving, it would spare your passengers much more time and disconfort.\n\nI wanted to share that with you because I just came today from a roadtrip and I was woth 2 of my friends in the car. I made a small detour, not more than 30 min to get them home. I spared them more than an hour to eachother and they got home safely, for otherwise, tired and sleepy, they would have had to take the public transportation at least 1h to their places. \n\nAll in all, if it's not out of hand, this would do them a great favour. I always do this because I put myself in their place and I simply can't fathom the idea of doing amd extra 1h with the public transportation, after a long road and carrying luggage.",

Absolutely not a big deal, happens all the time, I smiled, shook her hand and corrected the pronunciation along with a \"Lovely to meet you\"\n\nShe proceeds to say \"I'm just going to call you Anna\". This is not my name, it is my middle name. My first name is not hard to pronounce it is literally 3 letters. \nIt's a major pet peeve of mine when people do this, and it feels micro-aggressive that my own manager isn't bothered to learn my name, especially when it takes such little effort.\n\nHerself and the supervisor then continue on from the conversation by making fun of someone else's name, right on front of me \"Oh what was his name? Something... Owawa\" They were laughing and giggling like it was the funniest thing they've heard.\n\nNow when she addresses me, she shouts down the hall \"Anna!\" And I stupidly respond.\n\nAs I'm so new, I don't want to cause any havoc or ruffle any feathers, but how do I fix this?\n\nI have a plan of action, that maybe next time she tries to call me Anna I ignore her until she directly comes up to me and I'll say \"Sorry, where you speaking to me? That's just not my name, so I'm not used to responding to it\"\n\nOr is that too passive aggressive? This really means a lot to me, and I really feel like she should learn to say my name. Does anyone have advice for this, please?",
