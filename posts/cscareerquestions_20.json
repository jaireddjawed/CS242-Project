        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI am a recent career-changer into software development. Early thirties, and recent graduate of a post-bacc program for C.S.\n\nI'm working at a job that I really enjoy right now, but for about 66% of my market value. (It's a \"startup\"). And in a town that I don't enjoy to-boot. There is a lot more to unpack here, but I could write a small novel on this weird situation I am in. I want to learn about and explore other opportunites.\n\n*skip to the last section if you don't care about the context of my situation.*\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nTo keep it short, I am this startup's sole software developer, and I'm right out of school. I'm helping build two core products. I've been learning A LOT just by building a codebase by myself. I've been aggressively refactoring as it expands and I recognize problems. I'm very proud of what I have built. I also recognize the golden-egg I have of everything being \"greenfield\". I have autonomy, reasonable deadlines, am building something of my own, and don't have anyone to answer to. It's truly a job that naive young devs dream about, where they build a passion project rather than being a cog in a wheel and grind it out at a large firm. Love the work itself.\n\nThe cons however are that I'm their only dev, and the product(s) I am building are really just giant Python scripts. But very well-organized, well-designed, and well-modulated Python programs if I don't say so myself :)  It's a lot of data processing, transformation, and writing data to a new output format. It's in the 3D printing space, so dealing with making print files for 3D parts. It's very cool and I enjoy it. Safe to say, I'm only advancing my technical skills in learning how to properly modulate a codebase and build very clean and tidy code. And learning the value of full coverage automated unit testing :) Otherwise, I'm probably not growing my technical skills as quickly or as broadly as my peers at other companies. Not to mention the comparatively low pay (but also a lower COL town), and I don't enjoy the town. I do have large sway to work remotely, and I often do for \\~6 months of the year.\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n**I'm looking for yall's insight into different jobs I may be able to get, what they entail, and the tradeoffs between them.**\n\n1. Dev Ops\n2. Software Engineer\n3. Data Engineer\n4. (?) Embedded systems\n5. Other ?\n\nCan anyone provide insight on what each of these may entail, and pros/cons?\n\nData engineering has always piqued my interest, but my uninformed concern has been that I may be stuck in data engineering for my whole career and lose out in technical growth in true software development, or the opportunity to transition into a software dev role.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nscott\\_sleepy",

I’m 1 of about 300 or so of my training in North America.  \n\nIn case anyone wasn’t aware, healthcare is bullshit.  I’ve left one job where I built a first of its kind service for the state because I was working 90+ hours, new job where it’s better but I don’t want to kill my body until I’m 60.  Neck, back, shoulder and hand pain will only compound over time, luckily it’s mild to nonexistent currently.\n\nBy the time I’m 40 I could bank enough to completely pay off all my student debt and have some saved.  Wife and I don’t want kids and don’t live an extravagant lifestyle, so TC doesn’t need to be huge if it’s a good gig.\n\nI have been looking in to software engineer and data analyst career options, and I am starting to compile a plan to”attempt” to learn the skills necessary for this venture.  Hope would be that closing in on 40 I’d be searching for a coding based career and transition out of my current one.  \n\nI’ve viewed boot camps and DIY learning, and I’ve seen mixed reviews on how that appears on a resume.  I don’t feel a full time university based education would be the right fit for me at this point.  \n\nAm I foolish for entertaining this thought?  For those that have done a path even a fraction similar, what am I missing and what advice might you provide?\n\nAppreciate any insight, boarding a flight as I type with horrible neck pain after grinding all day before sprinting to the airport.

My previous internship-turned-full-time-offer was rescinded during the layoff and I couldn't find a job since with my backend internship, some full stack projects and club experience using flutter, IOS, or native android development. I know a bit of everything from all these experiences but no companies reached back to me. I am thinking this is because I have no full time experience working as backend and companies probably don't want to hand their servers to a 0 years of experience new grad. I know a bit of javascript and React Native on a very fundamental level, and I am thinking if I should really leave all my previous experience behind and start fresh looking for front-end internships after graduation and look for front-end jobs. The problem is, I don't know if this is viable considering I have just 3 months left and no previous front-end experience. I doubt I could even find an internship for front-end.\n\nCould you give me some pointers? Should I do it? Which stack should I go for? Angular or React Native? Typescript?",

My classmate sat at the very end seat so he could cheat and then i sat next to him. So here's what we did: he pulled out his phone during the exam and opened up chatGPT. He then started typing in the prompt question whille i oberserved the room to make sure the TA wasn't heading in our direction. After he was able to type in the code from chatgpt I then basically looked at his comptuer screen and wrote down everything he had. Our code was able to run successfully. This my friends is how u finesse the system :)",

I'm about to graduate and I've been applying for 2 months. \n\nBackground info:\n\n* I have a BA in Philosophy (logic focused) and am about to finish a masters in Environmental Science from a Top 3 CS school (big name).\n* I want to pivot into software engineering after graduation (long story), and so I have been studying CS at my school for about 1.5 years now in pursuit of this goal. I have taken classes in programing, OOP, data structures, etc.\n* I have a portfolio website with a couple projects (sadly only in R, from my bio work). I made the website so I guess that’s also a mini-project. I will hopefully have another project soon. I just don’t have time to do projects, I’m working 2 jobs to pay the bills and I’m in still school. If I don’t get a job for when school ends, I will continue having to work multiple jobs and will not have time for projects.\n* I have tons of work experience in my old field (conservation biology).\n* I am proficient in C++, Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, R, and Java. Currently taking an online SQL course, should be done this weekend.\n* I'm looking for internships, new grad positions, basically anything, but it has to be remote (long story, can't relocate, health reasons).\n* I have been working myself to the bone applying for jobs. I've applied to more than 100 jobs and have only gotten 1 coding challenge.\n\nI think I’m getting auto-rejected for everything I apply to, whether it’s internships or new grad.\n\nIs there anything else I can/should be doing? Is there somewhere else I should look? Every day I go on LinkedIn and apply for every new job I'm remotely qualified for. I always send cover letters. I also check Handshake (college job board), y combinator, and wherever else I can think of.\n\nI know I can do the work and teach myself any skills I need, but I can't even get a foot in the door. I'd literally be willing to take any CS job as long as it's remote and pays at least $80k/year. Even if it's an internship just for the summer I'd take it. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/JIQP260) is a link with redacted versions of my resume and cover letter\n\nI appreciate any help y'all can give me. I will say that my ability to do new portfolio projects is very limited, as a warning. I'm working 24/7 to support myself at this point, there's just no time/energy for creativity. I wish it weren't so.",

        "text": "I left an interview the other day feeling like a piece of shit. The interviewer who was the team's engineering manager seemed like he had a really harsh attitude towards me, and at the end he said I probably wasn't a good fit because my resume concerned him. He said it looks like I job hop too much. In the past seven year's I've worked at six places, but to be fair the first year of experience was internships:\n\n2 x 6 month internship (making minimum wage)\n\n2 x 1 year positions (slightly underpaid engineer II positions)\n\n2 x 2 year positions (second one a senior position, and finally making market rate salary)\n\nI was kinda taken off guard with how he framed it so negatively, \"how do you explain this resume?\" Like, if you didn't like my resume from the start why would you waste my time going through with an interview. My response was that I took a new position when my skills had surpassed my old position and there were no internal growth opportunities. I explained that they were not lateral moves. Which is truthful, but also that I was offered a 20-40% increase in salary each time. He kinda accepted that answer but I knew just by his attitude that I didn't want to work for him.\n\nBut then I creeped on him on LinkedIn and saw that his average tenancy at a company is 3.5 years. I feel like someone who job hops every 3.5 years looking down on someone who's job hopped every 1-2 years is incredibly petty. From his attitude I was expecting he'd been at the company for 10 years or something. Guess I dodged a bullet.",

I started to learn python, built some small projects, genuinely enjoyed it, and eventually got hired as an swe by the electronic health records(ehr) company that the clinic uses.\n\n\n\nSo this ehr company is very small(&lt;10 people in usa), with the majority of the SWEs being in India, and the accounting being in Eastern Europe. They don't have linkedin page; you would not know of them unless you were in the industry(private clinics and urgent cares) in our region; 90% of our clients are from one insurance group(which once again is a relatively small regional insurance group when looking at the larger health field). \n\n\n\nEssentially the company is small when compared to corporate companies but huge(in revnue) when compared to a typical small business. We wfh and the company is small enough where I work very close with the ceo/founder(Mike); we don't have typical tech company standups/sprints/etc. Mike and I have had good relationship for the past 1.5 years, I've learned a lot and have worked a lot ..but he made a lot of promises to me that he hasn't lived up to: raises and compensation bonuses. I put in my two weeks and he is mad mad; it's going to be hard to find someone to replace me and bring them up to speed- losing me/my role makes a big difference in their day to day. So I'm scared that when I start to apply to other jobs, he will make sure that his company doesn't recommend me. What do companies actually look into during their background checks? Especially when the company doesn't even have a linkedin presence. This company also doesn't have proper HR. I know this is a weird situation but I know mike well, and he will take this personally and be against me. Apologies if my question is ridiculous, I haven't had a traditional route into a cs career and I'm a bit scared going into applying for jobs.\n\n\n\nTL/DR: quit my job and my boss/owner of the small company is mad-can this impact me in the future during a background check? what do they check during a background check?!",

        "text": "I started in a new role as SE in a non-tech company in transportation this week. It was the longest week I've experienced in a long time, mainly due to a very depressing office environment. My last role was remote. I'm the only full-time programmer in the team. The others in the team are all mechanical engineers and it's my job is to clean up the application that was written by these mechanical engineers and others before them. \n\nI'm one week into it and we are all seated together in a small room - not an open space type environment. HR initially told me it was company policy to have two WFH days a week with more possible. Turns out it's actually zero WFH days that we can take - unless we want to make a big announcement about it. I think this is mainly due to the style of our project manager which is really strange as they are quite chill in a lot of other respects. I did ask about it but they didn't give me a straight answer and so I feel forced to go with the flow for now at least and just come into the office every day. I feel like I am too new to be bringing it up a second time in a week. But those others are there much longer and also only rarely work from home so it's an established thing at this point.\n\nSo, the main problem is that we are in this same room and my desk is right in the middle. I'm facing two others with this small partition in between, and I have the project manager at an angle behind me. So I feel hemmed in front and back. My back is facing the door into the office so anytime someone walks in my back and my screen are visible to them. It means I don't feel comfortable programming / trying crap out or even browsing for a minute or two because the project manager has my screen within eyeshot at all times. To make it worse, all of the others are working together on the same thing except me so I'm further isolated yet bang in the middle of the room.\n\nThere are tons of desks available down from our room. Should I ask to move or is it too early? Should I be direct and just say the room is too small and I can't focus? The others are very quiet but I'm finding the atmosphere a tense and it feels like being in a straitjacket. My neck is hurting from stooping down in my chair to duck constant eye contact with the two people in front of me. \n\nHelp. I have the drive to work, it's just this atmosphere and seating setup sucks really bad.",

        "text": "So to give some backstory I have worked for 2 companies over the past 2 years, all in .NET/C#/SQL. I enjoy working with the .NET framework and I'm good at it.  \n  \nI left my last job originally to just take some time off, but ended up getting into daytrading with mild success for 2 years. So 2 year gap.  \n  \nAs the markets got more volatile last fall I made the decision to start looking for jobs around early October and have been gradually ramping up my search until about mid January when I really hit the ground running. I've gone through countless screener interviews and had a few go through various levels but no offers.  \n  \nDuring my time off I moved from a city with a large tech industry to a smaller town, but there is one local software engineering company here. I went through the interview process with them in December for an AWS developer role and the process went great, but the role got frozen before they made an offer and eventually they restructured and the role went away.  \n  \nSo they called me up to interview for a software engineering position on another team that is predominantly Salesforce/APEX/SOQL which I did and it went well (really hit it off with the manager, company culture seems good enough, team would be good fit) and now they are preparing to make an offer if I want to proceed. The pay is going to be great, especially for a guy who has a 2 year gap in his resume looking for a job during very uncertain times and unprecedented layoffs in the overall tech industry.\n  \nMy concern here is that I'm throwing away all that .NET experience, strangely more so than the 2 year gap (because during that gap I did keep up to date with .NET core on my own) I think I want the job because of the immediate certainty it provides, but I just want someone to ease my mind that if I try to move on from here I can still count on my .NET experience down the road. I keep telling myself that if I hate it I can always start looking, but what good is looking if I've essentially ruined a good chunk of my development career by taking a position in a proprietary \"language\". The engineer in me tells me that development is development, but the realist in me tells me I will become invisible to hiring managers on .NET teams if I take this job for any significant amount of time. But on a more human note, I tell myself life doesn't always work out the way you want it, there are people that would kill to have an offer like this and that all the future scenarios don't matter. I'm hoping maybe someone in a similar situation or would be in a situation hiring a senior .NET position could give me some good news that it won't be a big deal. Also am I miscalculating when I think that time spent not developing is unintuitively better than time spent developing in a lower level language? Would really just love to hear any advice, insight, or anecdotal experience because it feels like I'm at a crossroads and really unsure what to do. Thanks guys.",

        "text": "I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 20 years experience in Java. Mostly backend, some full stack. Started playing around with Python a bit in lambdas. I'd really like to get more into ML/AI development because I think the applications are much more interesting (like biotech). For awhile I thought I needed a Masters, especially because my undergrad isn't in CS. But now I'm seeing these certificates and specializations on Coursera and Udemy from Stanford, MIT, [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai), etc. How seriously are these certs taken by employers? Anyone think you can get a job in ML with only one of them as the ML experience?",
