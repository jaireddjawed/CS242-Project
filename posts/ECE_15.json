What if the car moved at high speeds and sound chopped a bit, is it correct to say a 4 ghz radio or a higher rate of frequency would most likely have less chopiness",

Also the voltage drop around the current shunt would be in mV and quite a few of the loggers I found would need extra signal conditioning.",

Basically I want the signal path to be primarily analog, with the option to add some digital effects if desired.\n\nBasic functionality needed:\n- High fidelity audio input *and* output\n- Powerful, fast DSP capabilities for audio\n- Support for USB and/or MIDI input\n- High resolution DAC (at least 10 bits) to supply control voltages\n- Real-time clock (for sequencing)\n\nI looked into the Teensy 3.6 and it looks promising. With the audio board, it's capable of high quality audio output and input, some decent DSP capabilities, support for usb in, and it has 2 12-bit DAC's built in.\n\nThe other possibility I was looking at was the raspberry pi. Its native audio capabilities aren't great, but hi-fi audio hats exist. I could also use an external DAC and real time clock as well, but it'd be nice to have it built in. In terms of sheer processing power it crushes the teensy, but Linux adds a lot of overhead so my guess is it mostly evens out, especially if I want to add more peripherals down the line.\n\nAnyone know of other boards that fit the bill? Right now I think teensy is enough but I'm curious if anyone knows of other boards that might work well. Thanks in advance!",

Display manufacturers publish spec sheets for each display.

I don't think it's entirely decided by the OEM as replacing the display panel in a laptop with another can completely change the dimming mechanism and PWM frequency.  So, the dimming mechanism seems to be mostly defined by the display panel itself.  But if that's the case, and the example display panel is capable of 200 - 10 kHz, then what's the mechanism and process that determines the actual frequency used?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

(I am at school for CompE, but I am very new, so I don't really know much more than just the basics). I have a 130VDC, 16.6A treadmill motor that I am attempting to create a go-kart type machine with.\n\nI posted previously about the same motor, but I am now doing something very different with it instead. Is there any way to convert a car battery's \\~12VDC (and however many amps) to 130VDC and 16.6A to run the motor, and if so, theoretically, how long would I possibly be able to run it for? (I am thinking more of a ballpark answer, as in, will it run for like, 30 seconds, or like 15 minutes, before the battery dies?). Is the motor just too large to be powered for a long enough time from a car battery?\n\nApologies if this is a bit confusing - ask me any questions and I will certainly clarify! Thanks for the help!",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this is he right sub, but here goes anyways. I took apart an old treadmill a while ago, and kept the motor and all of its control boards. I am trying to make some sort of go-kart with the motor, as it is more than powerful enough.\n\nHowever, about five seconds after turning on the treadmill, it comes up with an error explaining that its speed sensor is not working correctly. Normally, the sensor uses the Hall effect to sense the magnets on a pulley that is spinning (the pulley has 8 or 10 magnets evenly distributed amongst its circumference, so when they turn, the sensor detects speed and such).\n\nHowever, as the mount is not perfect, and I plan on using a different pulley anyways, is there any way to fake said sensor, using equipment, by jumping pins, or anything of the sort? It has three pins: +5V, SIG, and GND. I have tried jumping +5V to GND, +5V to SIG, and GND to SIG. This has resulted in either a spark (one time, can't remember which), and no change in the result the other 2 times. TBH, I was just blindly testing.\n\nThe reason that I am not just running the motor on it’s own is because it is 130VDC and 16.6A, which is too much for any of my power supplies, and seeing as I already technically have the control boards that I can temporarily use as a motor controller, I am set.\n\nThis is more Short-Term, as eventually, I will have to convert a car battery to power the motor rather than the wall, but for now, I’d at least like to figure out a temporary bypass. Thanks for the help!\n\nEDIT: More stuff: I was kind of wondering if it would be possible to rig the board to supply full power to the motor at all times, and then introduce a potentiometer-type circuit in between the control board and the motor wire, thus, allowing me to control the voltage with said circuit, and just using the already given control board as a transformer circuit. Is that possible?",

My GPA from my last two years is a 3.82 (major GPA a bit higher), but I messed up pretty badly in my first two years of college at a different state school, so my cumulative GPA is ~3.5. I am currently at an internship with a national military research lab in radar, but I really want to focus on VLSI for my master's. Most of the jobs I see in industry either require or prefer an MS/PhD, and I feel I just haven't learned enough about the topic from undergrad. I don't really have any research experience besides this internship and a project I did with a professor last semester that I contributed very little to. I plan to try and find a research position this fall, but obviously it's most likely too little too late. Does anyone have any suggestions about what schools might be a good fit for me based upon these stats and assuming I can pull of a decent GRE? Ohio State is a great program, but I think other schools have better programs in VLSI and IC's in general. Really appreciate any advice anyone has for me.",

So I would have to use a 1uf capacitor and a 10-0hm resistor in series, but what I use for filtering? If I want to filter out everything below 16khz over time, what would I have to use? A potentiometer? If yes, then how do I find out the value required to adjust the filter's cutoff?

So as far as background education, I have taken up to Calc 3 and have also taken some general chemistry. I was accepted into Bradley University in Illinois just the other day and their school seemed great and I was awarded a nice scholarship. However, I was informed that I would be placed as a freshman in the program and would have to take 4 years. This is understandable but it is still frustrating because I took two years of college already with some challenging math courses. Plus, my family is not in the financial situation to pay for 4 years at a private school. \n\nI guess what my main question is, what should I do? Should I look into classes at my community college so that I can be accepted into programs as a sophomore? Any general advice would be great! Thanks!",

I love ECE and electronics engineering but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by all the industries and areas and sometimes I get a little bit stressed out thinking about how in 3 years when I get my degree I'll kind of have to make a choice and try to specialize somewhere.  Anyone else feel this way?\n\nI have a background in telecommunications and video/internet and wireless/antennas are areas that interest me a lot. I love amplifier circuits and treating different signals.  However, I'm also in a solar car student club and renewable energy and writing Matlab scripts for race strategy and optimization also interests me a lot.  On top of that, I love my differential equations and statistics courses, and I like my C programming classes and my programming projects for my club.\n\nFeels like there's so much to do and I want to do all of it... how did you all end up making a choice and focusing on something?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am currently studying about radar signal processing. My problem is all about range resolution and aperture resolution of radar systems. \n\n**Background:** As some of you already familiar with (hopefully) these stuff, we have slow time and fast time operations, separately. My system does not move during observation. I only take measurements of same place to understand any periodic movement at that environment. In my data, one of the dimensions corresponds to range and the other samples that are taken during some time duration. I calculated range resolution using c/2B where B is bandwidth and c is speed of light. On the other hand, I assume that my resolution at slow time is actually corresponds to Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) of system. For my system, time duration at slow time is 60 seconds and I got 240 samples. In fast time (range), I have 256 samples. Thus, I created 240x256 data matrix. My bandwidth is 2.5GHz and PRF is 100MHz. \n\n**Calculation:** Ok, I calculated range resolution as approximately 6cm. I thought, range resolution as resolution between 256 samples. But, when I think like whole A-scan (1 vector that corresponds to range) as 10ns (It is s my pulse repetition interval that is inverse of PRF), and divide 10ns to 256 points, I get approximately 3.9x10^(-11), that corresponds to 5.85 mm distance. By the way, my frame size for range is adjusted as 1 meter at range. When I multiply 6mm with 256 points, I got approximately 1 meter.\n\n**Problem:** I could not understand which resolution is my range resolution, 5,85 mm or 6 cm? If 6 cm is my range resolution, how can I explain the 5.85mm distance? Is there any limitation between slow time resolution and range resolution like range resolution has to be smaller than slow time? \n\nI hope, you guys help me. I am totally confused. I am sorry for the long post. ",

The subjects I found more interesting during undergraduate were the ones related to electromagnetism and electronics so I'm inclined to choose Energy as major and Electronics as minor (it's not the other way around because I'm not that interested on taking Computer Electronics subjects which are mandatory if I choose the Electronics major). But I keep hearing that Energy is kind of a dated area. Can anybody explain me better what an EE engineer with an Energy major works on? Do you think it's an outdated area? Most people advice me to choose the Control major with Computers/Telecommunications major, but I don't know. I liked the Control subjects, but I think it's really heavy on maths and it can become very abstract, that's why I prefer electronics and electromagnetism (more physics).

I pass all of those through the altera_std_synchronizer_bundle with a depth of 2. This makes all my unconstrained input paths go away. My only real question here, is I use one of the push buttons as my async reset signal. Since it's meant to be async reset, I'm not sure if I should be passing this through a syncronizer or not. If not how do I tell timequest that it's fine?\n\nNext up outputs: I have a tonne of unconstrained outputs. In fact all of my outputs are unconstrained. We can divide them into three types:\n\n   * 1) simple stuff like LEDs. This doesn't need to be synchronous, timing really doesn't matter. So how do I tell timequest to ignore this value?\n   * 2) VGA bus, 30 bit colour, clock, and some control signals go to a DAC, then the HS and the VS go to the vga port directly. I assume the HS and the VS pins are in the same situation as stuff like LEDs. The stuff going to the DAC is source synchronous. I have no idea how to deal with that yet, but I found a tutorial on it, and so I can probably figure that out.\n   * 3) SRAM controller. This is asynchronous but I'm assuming this is the most critical part of timing. It has a bidirectional data bus. I assume I need to add constraints as I would to a synchronous signal, but instead of constraining to a clock signal, I constrain them to other outputs. IE. this edge must happen no less than X ns after this other edge. Does anyone have any good resources on this?\n\nBasically I'm totally new at this, and not entirely sure where to start, so any advice would be appreciated.",

I am also minoring in mathematics and computer science.\n\nI have had two career goals for my life since I’ve been about 10 (I say career because I also have aspirations to marry my girlfriend and start a family some day). The first is to be a US Navy SEAL, which I know I am 100&amp;#37; capable of achieving. The other is to be a NASA astronaut. Originally my plan was as follows. Go to university and excel academically ( which I am doing well with so far) while becoming an engineer in addition to participating in any leadership roles I can. After graduation I would apply to Navy OCS and become a SEAL Officer. I would then do that until about the age of 28. Then work as an engineer until I was 40, and during that time being an engineer start having kids. Once my 2 or 3 kids started getting older I would apply to the astronaut program (around the age of 40 – astronaut candidates have been up to the age of 46). I would then be an astronaut as long as I am physically able, then hopefully work at NASA as an engineer until retirement.\n\nObviously I am very aware of the fact that life rarely goes the way we plan and these are simply goals.\n\nMy question for advice is this: I know that tech is constantly advancing, and I have a concern that I may not be able to get a career as an engineer because my education may be outdated. So should I join the Navy enlisted and serve for my time and then go to school afterwards? This wouldnt change any of my career goals after becoming an engineer because theoretically the length of time for everything would be the same, just switched around. My initial pro and con thoughts are that I will save money (GI Bill), be up to date on the latest information for a career, and not be doing a dangerous job around the time I want to start having kids. The downsides being that I may start having kids after the military and it would be hard to be a full time student, especially if I am married. I have often heard that people who say they will go back to school rarely do it.\n\nExtra info. I am currently going into debt to pay for school, which sucks. My father is telling me I should go to school and then military because he thinks it will be to hard to go back to school that late in life. I would most definitely be married to my girlfriend by the time I got out of the navy.\n\nThank you so so so much in advance for any answers you post.",

        "text": "I'm working on a project where I might be designing an industrial-ish control board. I say industrial-ish because this isn't something going into production any time soon and we don't really have any strict regulatory requirements or standards to meet. However, the few prototypes will see a lot of use, and they do need to be fairly robust, so it won't be a bad idea to design to some best practices.\n\nThe board will be a microcontroller board interfacing to a handful of quadrature encoders, switches, relays, some 24V I/O from another industrial system, ethernet, and CAN bus. It's kind of a cross between automotive and industrial.\n\nDoes anyone know where I can pick up common best practices for designing for example, 24V digital inputs and outputs, quadrature encoder inputs, 4-20mA circuit inputs for industrial environments? Things like optical isolation, ESD protection, short circuit protection, de-glitching, etc. Ideally I wish I could rip open some off the shelf industrial products and see how they implement things but I don't have the resources available to do that currently.\n\nAre the standards such as [IEC61131-2](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/31007) the best place to start? I've always had a hard time deciphering how to navigate the standards, and my company doesn't have any kind of subscription so if I need to go through a dozen of these it would get pretty expensive.",
