        "text": " What if i tell you we are inside the universe as well as universe is also inside our body and we also inside any living body sounds strange right! it is kind of possible because we don't know much about universe and multiverse anything can be truth the reason I'm saying that the universe could be inside our body or we are inside any living body because when we compare the structure of atom and galaxy it kind of similar. here is why\n\n 1.Comparison of atom and galaxy  \nThere is nucleus in the center of atom and electron revolving around the nucleus we all know same thing happen in our galaxies that a Black hole present in the center of galaxy and solar system are revolving around the center that is Black hole \n\n   Atom  = Galaxy  \n\n   Nucleus = center of galaxy(black hole)  \n\n   electron = Solar system  \n📷  \nSo i want to say that \"Every atom is galaxy and every galaxy is an atom\" it could be possible.  \n 2.comparison of Neuronal network of brain and Cosmic web Now I'm gonna tell you about cosmic web that is kind of similar to human body's neuron cell's that is present in our brain Cosmic web is mysterious structure that links up galaxies and primarily made of dark matter and as we know our brain is also very mysterious thing,  there is much similarities between cosmic web and neuronal network of brain.And here is fact that our brain contain 85% water(H2O) and our universe made up of 75 % oh hydrogen don't you think that there is connection between them.\n\n Neuronal Network = Cosmic web  📷\n\nHence our universe could be inside any living thing And also our body could be contains universe \n\n(\"Billions of universes could be there in universe\")That's my theory.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I love astronomy and find the cosmos so fascinating. \n\nBefore I ask my question, I truly want to leave religion out of the discussion. I find people get so defensive from both sides of the table that it becomes a pissing match on whose fundamental beliefs are more right. \n\nThat said, I get so confused with the Big Bang. I’m not incredibly “science/math/physics” smart, so apologies in advance if some of the terminology I use is incorrect. \n\nI can’t wrap my head around how all the energy and properties required to create the Big Bang reaction just came to 1 day simply exist, suddenly, out of complete nothing. How does this happen? All the elements required, all the energy, how did this just arise out of absolute nothingness? \n\nI’m very much a person who likes break down of origins, how things are created and transformed, and I find the concept of something just randomly appearing for no absolute reason as a very strange thing.",
