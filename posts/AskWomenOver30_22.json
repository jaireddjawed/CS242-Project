The details revealed that it’s tied to the dropped birth rate (which I’m sure is also directly tied to the ridiculous cost of living in my area). That got me wondering what will the future of the cities be like in 10-20-30 years from now. No schools means no need for the infrastructure, no school buses, no teachers, etc. \nI’m already dealing with all the challenges caused by the “silver wave” in my industry, but wonder if it’s going to be a problem across all fields. What do you think is going to happen with the areas where more and more people decide against having kids?",

        "text": "In 2021, I went on a date with a man I met via Bumble. I had low expectations for the date because he planned poorly - he wanted to get dinner at a very busy restaurant without reservations, but I knew we wouldn't get a table so I arrived early and got a table at a restaurant next door. The date turned out to be a ton of fun - we had a lot in common, despite being very different people and growing up differently. We planned to go on a second date, but I had to go out of town so the second date was delayed. During the time I was out of town, he received orders to deploy (he's with the US Army) from Jan to Oct. I was really bummed about it because it was the first time in a long time I had finally met someone very compatible with me, but we both still wanted to keep seeing each other. Things progressed over the next month or two until the holidays. I felt like we were an item because we were spending every weekend together and we weren't seeing other people. However, when it came close to deployment time, I asked him whether we were going to continue the relationship and that's when things started to fall apart. He basically said no, but wanted to stay in touch and see how things went during his deployment and was open to meeting up when he returned. He said he wasn't planning on dating or sleeping with anyone, but he didn't want the pressure of having to keep up a relationship while he was deployed. During the holidays, we kept in touch and talked by phone most days while I was spending time with my family in my home state and he had to do Christmas alone because he wasn't allowed to leave the base area. He deployed right after the new year (2022) and we kept in touch for the first couple weeks. But he took longer and longer to respond to my texts/calls. I knew he was busy getting settled, so I tried to give him some space. But finally when my frustration reached its peak, I asked him what was going on with \"us\" and he basically said he had too much going on and he didn't want to keep in touch anymore. It was a painful and abrupt end for me, and it took many months for me to get over him even though I implemented no contact (and was successful!).\n\nIn the intervening year while he was deployed, I tried dating without success (maybe went on two dates) and definitely didn't feel comfortable sleeping with anyone, even casually. And when October rolled around, I definitely wondered whether he was back in town, but I didn't want to embarrass myself by contacting him and possibly find out that he was in a new relationship or something.\n\nLast month I realized I would need to move for a new job, so I started packing up. When I first met him, I was actually moving into the house I'm now moving out of and he helped me pack and allowed me to use his old boxes from when he moved into his own house. I saved a lot of the boxes to reuse, which had his name and address on them, and it reminded me that he was probably in town. I also happened to see him on Coffee Meets Bagel, which confirmed that he had returned.\n\nI know this was not a good idea, but I found his number and texted him, pretending to ask for moving advice. He asked me how things were going and I shared vaguely that things weren't going so well. He said that things on his end weren't going well either, and asked if I wanted to meet for coffee or drinks to catch up. I figured he wouldn't be asking me if he was seriously seeing anyone, and I missed him a lot, so I agreed to meet up. It was very awkward at first, considering how things ended and not having seen each other for so long, but we quickly got back into our old groove over coffee. We ended up spending about 3 hours with each other, and it felt like old times. He also apologize for how he ended things. He said he'd had a lot of time to think about it during his deployment, and he realized that he basically was an asshole to me. I accepted his apology, but I wonder if he did it just to relieve his own guilt. However, I really appreciated him apologizing because most men would never do that. At the end of our hangout (or maybe it was a date bc he paid?), I told him I was moving in a few weeks but that I wanted to see him again before I left town for good, and he suggested we meet up again the following weekend.\n\nAt this point, I felt like I was in dangerous territory - that I could catch feelings the more I spent time with him, and may have to \"break up\" with him again when I finally move out of town, because I am fairly sure he wouldn't be willing to do a LDR. But at my age, it really is quite difficult to find anyone who I respect, who has their shit together, who is compatible with my values/beliefs/lifestyle, has a lot in common with me but is different enough to be interesting, who is attractive and is also attracted to me. I know he's in the same place: he feels he's getting old and he's worried about ending up alone, so it's a priority for him to get married and have kids soon. So I thought maybe I could just treat this like a \"farewell fling\" on my way to the next chapter of my life, and decided to shoot my shot: we had planned a busy weekend, so I suggested that I just spend the night at his place through the weekend to make the logistics easier (we live 50 miles from each other and he lives far from downtown). At first he was hesitant because he wasn't sure what my \"angle\" was, but I told him I just wanted \"some NSA fun before I leave.\" So he agreed and I spent this past weekend with him from Friday through this morning (Monday).\n\nWe had a lot of fun hanging out at his house (he cooked for me), going to an antiques show, and doing some touristy stuff, and it felt like we were dating again. (Maybe this is what friends with benefits do, or what casual dating is like? I have no idea because I've never had a FWB where we are actual friends and do non-sexual stuff together in addition to having sex; I've only had f-buddies where we literally only see each other for sex, but that was nearly a decade ago and I'm no longer interested in sex-only meet-ups. It's also been a long time since I dated around casually.) During this weekend he shared with me a lot of the family drama that's been happening with his dad and siblings over the past few months, and I told him all the reasons why I was finding a new job and leaving town. I felt like we became really emotionally intimate as well as physically intimate, and enjoyed each other's company bopping around town. We work really well as a team, and we are great at coming to an agreement about stuff. It's this high level of compatibility that is really difficult for me to let go of because it's very hard to find. Everything is easy and fun with him, and very low conflict.\n\nNow I am confused and I don't feel like this is the fling I intended it to be. Instead, I am falling for him all over again because it feels just like it did last time before he deployed, and I think he feels it too. I'm terrified that I will get hurt again when we part ways and I'll spend several months getting over him again. I wish I could stop having feelings for him and not want to continue this as a LDR, but that is where my mind is going. We have plans to go to a concert and spend the whole weekend together again, but I'm wondering if I should skip the sleeping over part, and only spend a few hours at a time with him so that I don't continue to build an attachment to him. But the sex is amazing, and after over a year of not having sex it feels great. (We were both the last people we had sex with before he deployed.)\n\nI'm really tempted to ask him whether he'd be interested in pursuing a LDR once I move because things are going well between us, with the goal of one of us moving to be with the other. I wasn't planning on asking, but over the weekend he said that he had almost attempted to date someone who lives 4 hours away before he realized that was sort of ridiculous. Now that I know he might be open to it, I sort of want to ask. However, I also don't want him to get upset at me and say, \"Well, the only reason why I agreed to do all this is because you said NSA,\" which would break my heart. \n\nAt the end of the day, I want to spend as much time with him as I can before I leave town in a few weeks, and I would love to continue dating him after that. But I don't want to make things awkward or painful for either of us by changing the dynamic and asking him for more than what he may be willing/able to give. Everyone here seems to advise that women should let the men initiate, but I feel like I've been able to get what I want from him when I've been the proactive one. \n\nHas anyone had experience with this and can provide some insight, advice, or cautionary tales? I care deeply about him, but I am terrified of getting hurt/rejected again if I ask for too much, but I'm also afraid of not getting what I want if I don't even bother to ask him for it or at least open the discussion.",

        "text": "Hi, \n\nI wanted to share my story hoping that it helps others. To brag a little too because it’s important for me to realize that I’ve learned to set my boundaries. \n\n**Pre-story** \nI am a child of abusive narcissistic father and an Angelic mom. Survived a  narcissist in relationship an another in friendship. Now, after a huge transformation I can sense narcs right away. \n\nSo this new guy at work gained everyone’s admiration. He’s extremely nice and polite that sometimes I felt nauseous from his “sweetness”. I have that kind of appearance that people think I am innocent. So I was the first that dude picked on. He started looking for my attention and at the beginning I ignored my guts feeling about him. I rationalized it as he’s trying to get settled at a new work environment. Long story short, dude started texting me some flirting texts, with hearts and kiss emoji where they are not even relevant. I politely say: this makes me uncomfortable. \nThen I get a  dramatic rant about how he seeks for my presence and all that sweet bs. I quickly make a screenshot and save it. Then I tell the guy that :\n\n- I don’t fancy him\n\n- I don’t mess up with married men and I won’t buy a bs about their unhappy marriage but they have to stay there for kids etc. Even if it’s true- not my problem.\n\n- Anything work related? Always welcome and we stay professional. \n \nI knew what would come next. Not my first rodeo. He says that I got it wrong and sh**. \n\nBut who cares? I’ve a simple rule: **If I feel unsafe and uncomfortable, I stay away. And I don’t care about person’s intentions**. \nI showed screenshots to a couple of coworkers in case situation escalates. \nThe dude as a regular predator or narc feels down as they never like losing. Later he played a jealousy card asking someone else out in my presence and keeping his eyes on me. Total ignoring. I still don’t buy it.\nA few weeks ago a lady reaches out and tells me he tries to hit on her but she doesn’t understand what’s going on as he’s married. And he keeps telling that he has only friendly intentions. My advice was that she doesn’t bother to know why he does it. The most important HOW SHE feels about it. PERIODT. \nShe brushed him off. Then she told me that was a great relief.\n\nRecently another friend of mine took a long leave and goes to a councillor because she felt intimidated and not sure she got it all well. Because she was harassed and she can’t prove it. The harasser convinced her she’s nuts and he was just friendly. \n\nI then chatted with a retired neighbour who was a part of occupational committee and she said that it’s hard to investigate the cases of harassment because predators are sneaky and victims are convinced “they got it wrong”. \n\nSide note: she also said that false accusations exist too. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to sum up what I do in these cases. Hope it helps. It’s applicable for any sort of relationship.\n\n- Trust your guts and red flags 🚩 \n\n- Always say openly that your interests go first and what they demand doesn’t match. \n\n- No ghosting. It’s a signal of fear and doubt. A room for the narc to fit in.\n\n- Save evidences\n\nBut usually pushing back helps. They’re cowards and deeply insecure people so they fear strong people. And it’s empowering \n\nDon’t be afraid to set your boundaries. Because eventually when you stop giving, you will be labeled as a b*tch anyway. So make it fair at least.",

Second person I met, we ended up going on two dates, and on the third date we hooked up. And OH MY GOD I did not realize how mediocre my sex life was for the last...ever (my ex was my first sexual partner). I don't know if this guy was exceptionally good or if I just have nothing to go off of, but I am not complaining whatsoever :) No idea if we'll hook up again, but absolutely no regrets if only to experience actual amazing sex for once in my life.\n\n I have done a LOT of work post breakup with therapy, learning about myself, and spending time with my friends and family and building a solid foundation. But, I can't also deny that I really needed this because as many who have been through a breakup or divorce, I felt like damaged goods, like I'm no longer attractive and I am past my expiration date. Now I can see that's certainly not the case. I feel I've connected with a side of myself that I convinced myself wasn't there. I convinced myself I didn't like sex! Seems laughable to me now!\n\nSo any way, for a hopefully fun post that might give people some hope after a breakup, tell me your hot stories! \n\nAnd I guess to follow through on my prompt, a few reasons why this sex was great: A) Communication and feedback - my ex was completely silent during sex, and I think it messed with my head a little bit.

Before leaving we had so much chemistry and he opened up to me so much and we loved being close to each other. He said he is gonna miss me before he left and while he was there too. He called and texted me every now and then. When he came back he texted me to meet and it felt totally different suddenly. He used to be very physically intimate earlier but this time he pulled back a little. He talked about he wants to move back home and wanted a traditional family now. He wants to be close to his family now and wants to get married soon. We spent a few hours together and then he said he’s tired and gave me a very friendly hug, that was it. I don’t know what to think of this. \nMore context - when we were going out I told him I’m not very traditional and he said he thinks he doesn’t care about all those things either, but suddenly after he came back it was all about him having kids and being close to the family. I’m so confused and disappointed and sad.",

What was dating in your 40s like? I realize that finding a life partner this late is rare and unlikely, but I wanted to nevertheless ask if there were any success stories. While life cannot revolve around a spouse/ partner alone, many women need emotional comforts and intimacy which singledom doesn't provide. One can't work every waking hour of the day (I tried and it reduced my productivity. left me exhausted and messed up my mental health). I live in a small town which offers little in terms of fulfilling hobbies or cultural activities. Most of my female friends are married and mothers with little time to socialize. How are single women in their 40s dating and finding love? Are the remaining decades of life going to be only about loneliness?",

        "text": "TLDR: I need help understanding the behaviour of a former friend. I tried to keep it as short as possible, but...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt my old company, I met Mia (not her real name).\n\nFrom the beginning, we got along well. I was interested in Luna (not her real name), and she was interested in John (not her real name), despite officially still dating James (not her real name).\n\nMia was a charming and attractive girl. We had many common interests, but I never considered her a potential romantic partner.\n\nMia had already confided that things with James weren't going well and that she was thinking of leaving him, but she was afraid because she had a house with him in the middle. I always tried to help her without ulterior motives.\n\nThe company party arrived around the end of January. At the end of the party, she was very down. She told me that she had kissed John and finally realized that things were terrible with James. There was a click between us when we were talking, but that was it. During the conversation, she said, \"I just see you as a friend\", to which I replied that I was helping her with James without ulterior motives. She hugged me and went back to the party.\n\nI left shortly afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month or two later, I went to work for a month in a different country. During this period, we talked as if I were still in the same place of work. We were 11 hours apart, but it never affected our friendship.\n\nWhen I returned, she asked to speak with me, and we went to the fire escape. She hugged me and told me that she had missed me. It was then that I started to see her with different eyes.\n\nOur superficial friendship evolved, and we shared more intimate things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the summer, we went to the beach together, more people should have gone, but we ended up going just the two of us (later, I found out that she had cancelled with one of our coworkers). We talked for hours and discovered even more things in common. It was also that day that she told me that she was finally going to leave James and that she was going to look for a house to rent and asked if I could help her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met her group of friends during city parties, and she met mine. When we were dancing in a group, I noticed that her best friend, Piper (not her real name), often looked at me, and when she did, she was smiling. I found her Instagram and added her.\n\nI was talking to Piper, but there was never that click.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the summer, Mia invited me to see a concert, and that Piper was going too. I said yes because it's been too long since to see this band live. We went to another city to see the concert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the concert, the three of us had too much to drink. I tried to put my arm around Mia's waist in the middle of the night. She complained and told me to go to Piper, I was going to say something, and she walked away.\n\nHalf drunk, I went to Piper and enjoyed the concert next to her; at most, I put my hand on her waist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Mia joined us, she discovered that Piper had hurt her foot and that I was helping her to her feet (she was leaning on my shoulder).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day when we were about to go home, I noticed that Mia was upset, I tried to talk to her, but she didn't want to talk to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the following weeks, the relationship with Mia returned to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of August, I had to go to another country to work again for two months.\n\nSince I wanted to explain things to Mia, I made an appointment with her. We talked about what happened during the concert. I told him that nothing had happened between Piper and me and that I didn't want that to affect what we had. She said she was really upset because she was talking to Piper. I told him I spoke to Piper occasionally but wasn't interested in her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to another country, and I discovered that Mia had had sex with James and that she didn't want to tell me because she was afraid of what I might think of her. During that period, she sent me some photos in a bikini, she also sent me pictures of the dresses she wore when she was going out at night, and once she sent me a photo saying that she had sunburned (Yes, she sent me a whole photo red, no underpants (nothing important was visible, but...).\n\nI didn't understand the hints at the time if they were hints at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came back after two months. When I arrived, Mia hugged me in front of everyone (if there were rumours before, after this point, they intensified).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA coworker of mine told me, a few days later, that while I was away, she only wore regular clothes and that since I had returned, she almost always wore a dress and had never put on lipstick while I was away. I told him he was crazy and dismissed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I started to notice different behaviours from her (finally, after almost one year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to have a date with her. We went out, just the two of us, but I chickened out and didn't say anything to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prepared myself mentally and decided to tell him on New Year's Eve. When I asked Mia what she had planned for New Year's Eve, she told me that she was going out with some friends and immediately asked if I wanted to go with her. I immediately said yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought of thousands of scenarios of how I could tell him my feelings. The five of us had dinner and then went to the disco. At the disco, I approached Mia and tried to dance with her, but she refused me again. With the idea of what had happened before, I tried to approach again and was rejected. My goal was to kiss her at midnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInside me, I was completely destroyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to enjoy the rest of the night, and it went relatively well, well... I had too much to drink to help me through the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the following days, I felt Mia super cold with me. I tried talking to her, but she basically ignored me.\n\nAfter a month, I finally managed to talk to her to realize what I had done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring our conversation, she told me several things:\n\n\"I don't like you that way.\"\n\n\"You told me we were just friends.\"\n\n\"I don't get involved with anyone interested in Piper.\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later, I left the company, and after a few months, I never thought about it again. However, a friend of mine started working at the company where I worked with Mia and told me he was working with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story no longer affects me, but I decided to try to see with you if someone can shed some light on what the fuck happened.",

The last meeting in particular really affected me; it was with a young mother at absolute breaking point. Her situation was very real and relatable to me as my kids are slightly younger than hers and she is in my age group. Since I've had my own kids, I'm more sensitive to situations at work involving children.\n\nOnce the meetings were done, I sat for a little while outside and later called a friend to debrief without breaching any confidentiality.

I'm also looking forward to having varied feedback, not just from single parents. Also, many thanks to anyone who can make it through my wall of text!  \n  \nI became a single parent 10 years ago and stayed purposedly single, I think possibly as a bit of an extreme reaction to abuse. I have never brought anyone home (friends included) and my child has never had to adapt or get used to having a third person around as I've focused 100% of my efforts in making her comfortable due to some health problems and needing extra support.  \n  \nI've always intended to resume my dating life once she was older and/or off to university, which she has decided to delay recently for a gap year. Recently I started a new relationship with someone I've known for over a year now and I've never been this happy before. I feel extremely safe and respected and I want to bring him into my life as well - he's not pushing for it at all and said he'd wait however long necessary, but I want him to start coming over. At the moment, it's only me going over to his place and staying there a couple nights a week. I've met all his family and friends and he's been pretty open overall. He's met my daughter briefly and they get along very well - but never at home.  \n  \nYesterday I was looking at potentially making some changes around the living room. Partly because I've always wanted these changes but was waiting until she's off to uni, partly because our place is set up strictly for 2 people and I want to start making it accommodating for a third one and eventually also having my own friends over (my child has friends over all the time).  \n  \nWell, she's had a meltdown over it and basically acted like I can only have someone over after she moves out. But what if she only moves out in her 20s? Am I meant to stay alone forever? I am now worried that I've given her too much control of our space (décor how she wants it, she wanted the bigger bedroom so she gets it, etc) and I'll struggle to help her adjust to these new changes, but at the same time I don't want her feeling pushed aside. Has anyone been through this, either has the parent or the child? If so... help..?  \n  \nI'm sorry for the long, long post and any advice is very appreciated.",

Eventually he moved far away with his \"new\" family and I didn't see him for many years following this. After a while my mom forced a relationship by sending us to him every summer for a couple of weeks. He was mostly absent during these visits. Throwing us a few dollars to get through the day and off to work he went. He was also an alcoholic. He was the type to disappear on Friday night and wouldn't reappear till Sunday night or Monday morning to repeat the process again. This continued for a bit into my preteen years. I didn't feel like I could really connect with him, mostly because it felt like he didn't want to try to connect with me. It was most hurtful during these visits because I could see him interact with my step sister and they did have a relationship. He was a dad for her and that has always stuck with me because why couldn't he have tried for me too? \n\nEventually the visits stopped because my sister and I couldn't keep up with pretending like everything was okay. I cried when I turned 13 because I waited all day for his call to wish me a Happy Birthday and that call never came. My sister and I found out that same year that he got married and didn't invite us to his wedding. We found out the day of his wedding when his sister, my aunt, called and asked when we would arrive. \n\nI wanted him to so badly be my dad, the dad that would be there for me, protect me and offer me advice and guide me as a dad would. As a kid I loved hanging out with him. He was so cool with the music he listened to and the old blue chevy truck he used to love to drive us around in and he made me laugh with his silliness. I feel like I waited a long time into my teen years for him to realize I exist and realize how much he missed me. I stopped waiting though. He never tried more, he'd call maybe once or twice a year or send a holiday card with $50. He was predictable and I realized this just was who he was. I became resentful and that resentment stuck with me till now. \n\nOur relationship never flourished, I never got to tell him how much he hurt me over the years. I always thought I'd have more time believe it or not. I thought as I got older I'd be able to understand him more. Be more forgiving of his actions, understand him better and be able to build a relationship after I got the courage to tell him how I really feel. But now that's not an option. \n\nHe died alone in a motel room. He was 57. I didn't know this but he was homeless for the past year. Living on peoples couches and in his car. I don't know if he ever got his alcoholism under control. I don't even know who he really was at the end. He would randomly message or call me in a drunken state talking about the weirdest things and I'd laugh at him for his craziness. I talked to him a week ago about his new fling, he told me he was scared about it. I told him that life is scary sometimes but we just gotta keep going forward and that's it. \n\nI feel confused. He was my dad and he's gone. I have a sense I will be filled with guilt over not trying hard enough to make a connection happen but at the same time he never tried either. I think I'll miss him a lot and I wish I could just call him right now and tell him how I really feel but I can't.",

My problem now is I've been renting a house with this guy and 2 other roommates (they are a couple) since Nov 2020 and we just renewed for a 3rd time in Nov 2022. \n\nSide note: I didn't know my roommates prior to moving in (they were like acquaintances) and I knew my ex for a year. My ex and one of the roommate's are life-long friends. Also my ex and our one roommate lived in the house before myself and our other roommate (his gf) moved in. My roommates allegiance lies with my ex, which is understandable, but it's definitely anxiety-inducing for me. \n\nAt first I was committed to sticking it out but began having panic attacks when I think about all the months between now and November. I don't want to say I don't feel safe in that house, but I guess in a way I feel very outnumbered. I don't think remaining in this house will be good for me. \n\nI need to get out and I need help planning my exit. Needs to be done correctly. I've reviewed my lease and wondering if subletting could be my out? Not even sure how to approach this though--do I get permission from my landlord first or do I tell my roommates I'm trying to move out and speaking to our landlord? If I get permission do I just put an ad out on craigslist? \n\nI don't even know where to begin here. Also, I've been radio silent for a week and staying with a freind. I should probably do something soon.",

I've never experienced anything like this and I feel so crazy for even acknowledging this... But I can't deny what I'm noticing.\n\nBasically I (30+ f) noticed recently that a close friend (30+f)  I've had for many years has been copying almost all of my big life choices over the last couple years. Everything from seemingly trivial things like hairstyles and fashion choices to huge things like changing religions, splitting with partners, pursuing medical diagnosis and questioning their sexuality.\n\nAt first I thought these were just coincidences, and brushed it off because friends inevitably influence each other sometimes.\nBut as I was reflecting on life a few months ago I realized what a shocking number of things they have copied, and always 3 to 6 months after I do something. And if I change my mind on something, they do too. \n\nWhat makes it even weirder is every time I've asked them about it, they act like they've been contemplating doing that thing for ages. Possibly even years! But prior to me doing it they never mentioned wanting to make any of these huge changes and may have even expressed strong concerns about how me making the change could negatively impact our friendship.\n\nLike I said I brushed it off at first but now am feeling so creeped out that I have decided to put a lot of distance between us.\n\nSo I guess I'm mostly wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this and wtf you did to rid yourself of the feeling of having had your life slowly hijacked.\n\nTldr: a long-time close friend has been copying my big life decisions for a couple years and it's making me feel suffocated and crazy.",

(I sent food, texted, etc, but apparently this “wasn’t enough.”) \n\nI thought our friendship was over then, but we sat down and had a heart to heart- I explained that I really valued her as a friend, but I didn’t feel like she was respectful of my time- when we made plans, she would constantly reschedule at the 11th hour and then get irritated when I wasn’t available on her chosen date; she would call/text at times when I had said I was busy; and I felt like she was unfairly upset when I had other plans. \n\nOur talk hurt her, but to her credit, she did seem to try to make changes….until her 45th birthday. \n\nShe perceives this as some major milestone birthday- she asked if I would go on vacation with her and a few other women. This was to a very pricy resort, and after discussing it with my partner, I let her know that I appreciated the invite, but that I wasn’t comfortable with the expense or the time I would have to take off from work. She texted back “fine.” ….and that’s the last I heard of her. \n\nSince then, neither of us has contacted the other. We had a lot of good times, but this isn’t a healthy or sustainable relationship. I’m fine with it ending, but we are still connected on social media, I haven’t blocked her, etc. \n\nI’m wondering now if I should just close that door? If she were to reach out to me i think it would cause me a lot of stress. On the other hand, blocking her seems to be stirring the pot and I know she will play the victim.  \n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "I just need a sanity check. I’ve been friends with someone since our first day of college. I considered her one of my very best friends. We were both party animals back in the day. I always felt like I put more into our friendship than she did.\n\nSeveral years ago, I got into therapy and got clean and sober. It was hard. I was also getting out of an abusive romantic relationship and learning to have standards. Around this time, she suddenly stopped talking to me. Like, stopped responding to my texts for 7 weeks. I knew that during this time her cat was sick, which was hard on her. But I would ask how the cat was doing and how she was and she would just not respond. She ignored me for almost two months. Eventually, she sent me a message saying “I hope you are well” with some emojis. That's it. No \"how are you\". I was a little annoyed so I was short and direct with her when I responded: “I’ve been ok but I’ve been feeling really alone.” Her response? More emojis and then silence. I was just kind of weirded out, had no idea what was going on with her, if her cat died, if she’d joined a cult, if she was depressed, if I’d said something wrong, if she didn’t like me anymore because I was sober and boring now. I definitely stressed out about it. \n\nThis was not unheard of. In the past she would drop off the face of the earth for weeks, months, or even years at a time. But before, I hadn’t seen the behavior so clearly because i was just a flakey party animal. When I changed my life, I decided I wanted closer, more dependable friends. \n\nThen, fast forward to this fall. We hadn’t spoken for 18 months. I’ll be honest: I was annoyed with her, and thought that what she did was rude. But I took a job in her city, in her neighborhood, and figured I’d get back in touch because we were living in the same place for the first time since college. I didn’t feel great about it, because I had started getting better at setting boundaries in therapy and sobriety, but I figured I’d give it another chance. I sent her an email. She responded. And we started hanging out again. I always felt like I was putting in more effort, driving her around, picking her up, paying for things even though I earn half of what she does, but really missed her and was willing to make these small sacrifices to keep the friendship. \n\nI recently suffered a severe, life-changing spinal injury. Even through the pain, being in and out of the emergency room, I drove her to the grocery store, fed her cats while she was away, etc. I always sensed this weird aggression beneath the surface, like she resented me for something. Once, when she stopped responding to my texts for a week and a half, I conferred with my therapist and she said I should tell her how it made me feel. So I did, really nicely. I said that it made me worry that I’d done something wrong when she suddenly stopped responding, and made me worry that she wasn’t ok, and it really affected me negatively because her friendship was really valuable to me. She called right away after reading it, so I was really happy. Everything seemed addressed.\n\nI had another setback with my spinal injury and went to the hospital. They told me to do soaks in the tub. She has a bathtub and I don’t. So I sent her a friendly text asking if I could take a soak in her bathtub (I don’t have one) at some point that week (she lives five minutes from me), saying that I could bring her takeout, do shopping for her, etc. just that it helped relax my muscles. I said that if she needed space or was doing other things that I had other people I could ask and she needn’t worry. Silence. I didn’t hear from her for three days. I asked someone else and wrote her “don’t worry about it”. Maybe I shouldn’t have said that, and yes I was a little pissed. But then three more days later, she sends me a text saying “don’t you DARE snap at me. You snapped at me when \\[her cat’s name\\] was DYING and whenever else you want to.” It was honestly unhinged. I feel like I bend over backwards not to pressure her to do anything, to make her life easier. So I wrote her that I was ending the friendship and told her not to contact me again. \n\nAnyway, I know no one here knows the particularities of this friendship, but is it ok to get a little annoyed when people drop off the face of the earth? I don’t even think anything I said was that bad. It just struck me as manipulation when she brought up her dying cat and my (extremely mild) annoyance with her for disappearing for nearly two months.

At this point I don’t know how to date anymore. Nevertheless, my date and I agreed that our date went well and we both had fun. We’re going on a 2nd date next week. Annoyingly though, my ex suddenly reached out and shared things and whatnots. I’m not responding but just annoyed with things I didn’t need to read. What in the actual heck is the universe telling me? Yup I may have the tendency to overthink about situations like this but I won’t lose sleep over this",

        "text": "I'm having a hard time stepping back for perspective - right now it feels like no choice is the right one. I'd love to hear what ya'll would do in my shoes!\n\nI'm (32F) stuck in a stay/go dilemma in my marriage of 8 years. No major red flags or abuse, just incompatibilities that leave me feeling unsatisfied a lot of the time. We're currently working on this in couples counseling so I'm hesitant to throw in the towel just yet, but also want kids and know I'm not getting any younger. Until recently there were major financial obstacles to leaving, which I wouldn't say is the reason I've stayed, but definitely made leaving a much less appealing prospect. I recently landed a new job that will offer me much better financial stability, but it doesn't start till late April. Our current home has no room for a wfh workspace, so in the next few months I'll need to figure something out. My options:\n\n1. Build a small studio/shed on our property to work from. Would be really convenient to have a work space at home, and also probably the most cost-effective option long term. Downside is that I could potentially be dumping my $ into something I will walk away from if I decide to leave the relationship.\n2. Rent an office in town. Would be at least a 30 min drive from home, and probably around $700-1000/month. Nice because it's not connected to my home and I wouldn't lose it if I left, but feels like a stupid amount of money to spend on just a work space (plus having to commute for a wfh job would really suck).\n3. Pay for a membership at a local coworking space. Also fairly cost-effective, but still the problem of a 30 min commute, and honestly the prospect of having to work around other people is not super appealing (especially since my new job will involve lots of zoom meetings).\n4. Leave my marriage and move into my own house. This option is the real wild card. I'm still not totally sure I want to leave and have lots of fear around making the wrong choice. But have also been grappling with this for a long time so part of me feels like I just need to rip the band aid off and take a leap of faith. But I'm worried I won't be able to find a place and get set up in time before my new job starts (which will be waaay more demanding than my current job and I really want to be 100% mentally present and ready to excel at it). Also worried that I will still be a total emotional wreck just a few months out from a break up, and unable to put my best foot forward in a new role. And have no clue where I would move. We live in a super HCOL area and I'm not sure I'd actually be able to afford my own place here. Buuuut if I don't leave now and later decide I want to, I can't imagine upsetting my whole life within the first several months of a new job. So feels like choosing to stay in our house now means I wouldn't have another chance to go till much later this year. \n\nWhew, if you're still here reading - what would you do in my shoes? Any advice/tips?? I'm struggling here and truly can't see the best path forward.",

        "text": "I am really needing advice and outside perspective on navigating situation with close friend. \n\nA year ago she got bypass surgery and started a journey of health and fitness. So happy for her! We changed from \"just hanging out\" to workouts or active activities instead. Which I am 100% on board and love! I'm very active and it's been great fun. In August after she lost about 80lbs she decided she wanted to run a marathon and wanted me to do this with her. I was 100% down and supportive of this. When training for a marathon there is a schedule of miles you run each week. So our schedule was 4 days in the week we run. 2 of the runs we did together (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and the other two we do separately. It was going great until I had an unfortunate injury where I dislocated my hip the beginning of December. So unfortunately for me as much as I want to and wish I could, I can't run 20+ miles a week and as the marathon is in April I am unsure if I will have enough time to be able to have a recovery and then time to train. So we still work out together on Tuesdays and Thursdays we are just doing slightly different things now due to my injury. (She runs 5-8 miles, I can only run &lt;3miles and weight lift while she finishes her miles).\n\nHere is where the problem has been: this has made us closer friends however during her health journey her husband has become increasingly unsupportive and frustrated. \n\nUnfortunately he is the type that thinks because she works an office job (he has a manufacturing job) that she doesn't actually do \"real work\" she just sits at a desk all day so the household responsibilities fall on her because he is tired. (Even though she makes more money than him at her not real job) they have 3 kids and he doesn't do much. She cooks, cleans, runs the kids around, whole 10 yards. In fact the \"you should have asked\" book seriously could have been written by her. Anyways as she has been on the health journey she is obviously spending more time on her with working out more regularly than she ever has in the past, and as she has been seeing changes in her appearance her self confidence has been growing as well. So the train has been running down this track but it did inevitably hit the wall. He told her he wanted a divorce because he doesn't like that she is spending so much time away (4 workouts a week for 4 hours total), he has to watch the kids, and on the 2 weekdays dinner isn't on the table promptly at 6:00 and he wants to go do his own things on the weekend without her and the kids. (Like all day fishing/hiking/rock climbing trips, things 3&amp;4 year olds can't do easily)\n\nTheir marriage is none of my business nor do I wish to involve myself. Of course I have my person opinions but that doesn't matter. She has to make her own decisions. I am her friend and I will support whatever she decides for her self. So she told me \"I am not emotionally strong enough to be single\" after she acknowledged to me that if he were to leave her day to day physically wouldn't change much since she does most of it anyways. So she is now making adjustments to try and appease him so that they stay married, but at the same time do things she likes and finds enjoyment in.\n\nSo first we had to change gyms because now in order for her to work out she needed a place with childcare for the kids. Both for the days we work out together and on the days we don't . Then it got more strict as I used to meet at her house after work, I'd change, then we'd go to the gym, work out, go back to her place, and hang out for 30-1hr while she cooked dinner. Now we are on a strict timeline of getting to/from the gym. Like to the point if there is a car accident that sets me 10 minutes behind getting to her house it's a huge problem. Also no more chit chat after.\n\nSoo... I'm over it. I realized I actually hate this want to go to a different gym that has more offerings (but no child care), I hate the pressure of the strict timeline, and also I hate feeling like I'm personally causing issues with her marriage. I feel like I've inadvertently gotten so far into this hole I'm like how do I even get out? Do I slow fade until it's not expected we're going to workout? Do I have point blank conversation and how? I don't want to end the friendship entirely, just the current dynamic. I also would like to be clear I'm available to her for support/hangouts, But I'm not even sure if it is logistically an option to remain close friends anymore.\n\nThe whole situation just makes me sad. Any advice would be greatly appreciated...",

Or do you feel your 30's is the best you've ever felt?\n\nFor me, it's mainly superficial things. For example:\n\n1. I used to be obsessed with taking photos. I thought I looked good in every photo I took. I can't pin point an exact day, but I feel like around age 32 I started noticing I look older in photos. My cheeks and neck started to sag. Under eyes started to show harsh shadows. I'm 33 now and I HATE taking photos. I can't even look at my photos from a couple years ago because I get depressed at how much I've aged. \n\n2. I used to think every outfit looked good on me. Then at age 31, I felt \"too old\" when I tried on a crop top. I felt my knees looked less firm and I noticed spider veins forming. I find myself wearing a lot of baggy clothes now to cover my figure, whereas I used to wear tight clothes to show it off. \n\n3. I used to make funny videos for IG and TikTok. It was my favorite thing to do. Now, every time I try to make a video, all I notice is how old I look. So I'm never in the mood to make funny those videos anymore.  Which has made me feel like I'm not funny  :/\n\n4. My hair is going gray like crazy, almost overnight. \n\n5. Not related to vanity, but I have a pinched nerve that comes and goes. \n\n6. My voice is less bubbly and loud. My personality is also less loud. I miss having a lot of energy and being a loud, fun, and carefree 20 something year old. \n\nWhat about you ladies?",

        "text": "I would be grateful for some advice for a workplace problem. I’m an author who has been invited to be a coauthor for a book. The person who is in charge of the book is also a author who approached a publisher I have worked with in the past, which the publisher agreed to take on her project. I get assigned as one of the coauthors and everything goes through her. In the past, working with this publisher I greatly enjoyed and I had no issues. However, I feel there’s a growing pattern with this person as every time I’m assigned a task, when I complete a task, she acts like it’s not what she wants. I do not have other problems in my life this way. I do believe almost every thing I have submitted to her, there has been some sort of problem which was not clarified as she wanting that before starting. At this point, I’m deeply frustrated, and I’ve written an email out with what I’m thinking I want to send. I don’t want to mess up my relationship with my publisher while I also want to stand up for myself. The following is an email I’m thinking about sending. “I’m finding that often I’ll understand a request one way but discover when I turn it in that you had different expectations. Could we try taking more time to discuss what your envisioning before I start to work on something? I believe this will save both of us time. I’m also surprised after receiving this last email stating, “Hi, Here is the document with your changes applied. Please approve.” and I replied with “Hi, It looks great. I approve.” that I was still asked again to submit more changes after the final document was sent to me and already approved for publication. I do not understand why this was needed, but I went ahead and attached the other document that I worked on for several additional hours to this email.” I’m also planning on cc’ing my publisher so he knows what’s going on. I’ve worked with my publisher before so I can’t see him doing something like this. (She gives me instructions. I complete task of making a few minor suggestions for changes before publication since I found several mistakes. In her email, it quoted “Do not mark or make changes to this document . A note to me will do.” I did this and made comments in word so as not to change document since working with past editors, they did this. I also attached an extra document showing the changes if they were made with the comments where it would change. She replied back that it’s needed to be in a different format and what I sent won’t do and that the document can’t be changed. She asked for paragraph no., like no. Page no. What it says… what is should say..At this point, I’m extremely frustrated since I sent hours on this. I replied back and cc’d my publisher stating there must be a misunderstanding since I sent two separate documents and did not correct or tamper with the document. I even left alone part of the document where two pages of my writing was left off as to follow instructions even though it’s suppose to be included since it’s final editing and approval.   She wrote the rest that was left off in an email and not in the final document. After I sent that last email cc’ing my publisher, she quickly sent me another email forwarding me a new final document with applied editing changes. I approved it. Now, a few days later she’s stating the publisher needs that format for corrections even though she sent the final document. How would you handle this? I have never had this kind of problem before in writing books or articles online. I could be wrong but I also feel my publisher wouldn’t approve this unless she’s not telling him everything. I don’t want to look like I’m not a good worker with my publisher. I didn’t cc my publisher when I approved the final document. Any advice appreciated. Last post before this one has a few more examples for context.",

I am also much more of a “do-er” than him, so don’t have a problem with just DOING stuff around the house even if I don’t want to. It’s instinctual for me to wake up on a Saturday morning and see, for example, that’s there’s hair in the sink and clean it. It feels like maybe my over exertion or hyperdoer instinct is what’s causing him to sit back. Do I sit back?? But then what if nothing gets done! Additionally, I am starting to really resent this dynamic. I worry that as a man, he has internalized this (albeit unconscious) attitude/aloofness that house chores aren’t his problem, which frankly pisses me off, and makes it hard for us to talk about this because my resentment comes out in my asks of him etc. So yes, we have talked about this stuff many times, and it leads to defensiveness on his end and anger on mine. Of course I know we need to sort this out before kids, so… please help! He is a good natured guy, but man does this get to me. What has worked for you? How do I get through to him?",

For less than £100 I managed to get \n\n- fiorucci jeans \n- a silk Armani cardigan for work \n- a little prince silk scarf from a Turkish designer \n- a white silk shirt from Laura Ashley\n- a navy silk shirt from DVH\n- a silk Guess shirt \n\nI’m so happy- it took a while to find things but it’s worth the effort given that I could have got 2 of those max from Zara for the same money and worse quality.\n\nSo here are my tips:\n\nSet the apps up with your sizes and search regularly if you have something in mind. \n\nSearch by material, you know silk, cashmere ect will be good quality so hunt for those and avoid polyester stuff that won’t last.\n\nLook for brands you know what are good quality. I think DVH is good for workwear and they’ll be many more that I can’t think of right now. \n\nAlways negotiate with the seller- don’t low ball as that’s rude but you can probably send an offer for 20% off and 4/5 times they’ll accept. \n\nFilter by brand new with tags if you want some really great bargains. So many people buy stuff and never wear it.\n\nCheck measurements/sizing. Older vintage sizes have less generous measurements and as someone from the Uk I have to watch out for American brands (a Uk 8 is a US 4). \n\nThis has become a little hobby for me as I get so much pleasure. I haven’t had to buy anything brand new other than underwear for over a year. I’m much better for the environment and I’m getting higher quality items than I’d buy on the high street.\n\nAny other tips or good brands to look out for?",

        "text": "The guy (35M)I was seeing for 8 months broke it off with me, I (38F) had been away for two months on a medical situation and we did long distance from another country. Long distance with him was extremely challenging as he doesn't text, chat or do video calls, he has always been a bad communicator. I kept insisting we jump on a call to connect and at one point I complained to him how frustrated I was that he isn't putting any effort into initiating the video calls, his reply was that he is checking his phone often to reply to me and that he usually doesn't message anyone but he is doing it for me; I thanked him and appreciated the effort he is putting in on messages but this concern is about video calls. He totally ignored my concern, this was kinda my only \"I am frustrated\" text I sent him. \n\nOn Monday I just came back from a month long medical treatment, 23 hr plane journey and severely jetlagged and we met that evening -  it was amazing to be reconnected, I cooked, we watched movies, he had got me a Christmas gift (I wasn't here for Christmas). While we were in bed and I threw him the question about how he feels about me and he replied with \"I like you and I enjoy hanging out with you\" I was disappointed that he is still saying only these line after being together for 8 months. We ended up having a serious talk and he said how he  isn't feeling very strongly and that he takes time to develop feelings which seemed fair. Then he made a weird statement about how he enjoys time with his friends more than he does with me, which really hurt me which later he said he said \"poorly phrased it\". In the end he asked me \"do you want to end things?\", I was a bit shocked when he asked that and I replied that if there is major incompatibility we shouldn't continue, but if there are things that can be worked around we should. When I asked him the question back -if he wanted to end things, he said \"he doesn't know\" leaving me feeling terrible.\n\nWhile we were exchanging grievances, I mentioned how I want emotional connection and it's lacking from him, he has told me a few times now how he isn't an emotional person, I think I didn't translate this as \"emotionally unavailable\". I also told him I am at a point where I want a relationship to go towards marriage but obviously with the right guy and I don't want to settle. Idk if the word marriage freaked him out. On the same note he replied he doesn't have such pressure  (which btw I already clarified before I even started this relationship, he was also looking for a LTR). After all this he said let's think about this and meet over the weekend, he hugged me tightly and asked if he could kiss me; I was just very confused about how much stuff happened in such a short span of time. I had one of those lame ass kiss and he left. He also made a comment about how next week we might grow stronger after giving enough thought. I wasn't expecting this at all on the day I came back after being apart for 2 months.\n\nYesterday, we met for lunch and he told me how he doesn't see us being a long term thing and he doesn't want to string me along. He told me he doesn't see us together in a few years and I wonder if this had something to do with me bringing the \"marriage\" topic. I thanked him for being honest, he suggested we be friends and I said no. I was hurt sitting there feeling a void in my heart. I did like him a lot! Tbh I went with the mindset that let's do some exercise together to see if we speak different love languages and that might help understand each other a bit and was going to work on this.\n\nAs I reflect - He is emotionally unavailable, which drove me crazy, I was extremely drained chasing him for attention and I like emotional support. In the long run he would have left me feeling very lonely in the relationship. He wouldn't put any effort into planning our dates, which he admitted today is a flaw in his personality as he just \"goes with the flow\", this was when I clarified how I have picked most of our date activities while he hasn't done much, this was a response to his comment on how he enjoys time more with his friends than me. He wouldn't text me for days and I was left very disconnected with him, when we met it was all nice, but when we were away he was very distant. I felt a lot of the time I was carrying the relationship and it was overwhelming. Emotionally I felt I could never get past the superficial level - he enjoyed discussing dnd strategies, game theory , psychology and other stuff more than his feelings. \n\nYou might wonder why I stuck around - when I asked him if he had feelings for me, he said yes. He has never once cancelled a date he agreed to meet, he has always shown up. He told me how he never spends time with people he doesn't like and the fact that he is showing up says he likes me. He is a decent guy, very respectful, more of a gentleman and we connected a lot intellectually and we are kinda nerds. I thought of ending it with him multiple times and I kept giving him time since he was actually a nice guy and was hoping things will change. Idk if I would have felt better if I had actually gone with breaking it off with him due to his poor communication and low effort. I spoke to multiple people and they all just told me to give it some time and not to rush into breaking it off with him since he is an otherwise nice guy.\n\nI absolutely have no intentions of reconnecting with him. When he suggested we stay friends, I rejected that idea saying that's not how I function. I need to continue working on my relationship goals and I don't want to be \"friends\".I told him I need to take care of myself and my wants. I think people should just stop using that term.\n\nIdk what's the whole point of this post, but I am just floating in a myriad of emotions and very hurt and sad. This is both our first LTR, if it matters. My anxious nature and his distant self really didn't do a good job, I was working on regulating my emotions but to be honest I wasn't asking more from him. I wasn't needy or clingy, I gave him enough time apart. I just don't know how this all came to and end so quickly. I also don't know what I could have done better or if he is just a wrong match for me.",

        "text": "Hi all, I (30f) have a brother (22) and a sister (34). Sister and I are married, she has 3 kids and I still don't have any. Our brother is in college and none of us live with our parents or anywhere close to them.\n\nMy parents have always had a dysfunctional marriage which I now know when I got to have an exceptional partner. I now see what are all those things that my mother never had in her marriage (love, support, respect, kindness, physical affection shown in front of others, etc). The fact that she was a housewife throughout our entire childhood didn't help at all, because she put us in the center of her entire existence and now that we all left the house, she became desperate because she was never anything else in her life but a mother. She doesn't have an occupation, so now her life doesn't have a purpose in her opinion because we no longer need her in that way.\n\nI just want to stress the fact that both of them had a good relationship with us and definitely were the best parents they could, but they just never were good for each other.\n\nThey live in a rural area of a small European countriy where a divorce in their almost 60's would be an earthquake to the community, and that is just not something that my mother could deal with mentally. Also, there isn't an AA group anywhere near her place of living.\n\n5 years ago my paternal grandmother was seriously ill and tied to the bed, so my mom took care of her for couple of months practically on her own. Dad was there to support financially but never fed the grandma, never bathed her or did any other of the dirty jobs when you have an old and non moving person in your care. That was the breaking point for my mom and she started drinking.\nI first thought that she took some of grandma's strong meds and that's why she had trouble speaking on the phone, but soon we found out that she was drinking heavily. That was devastating to me. \n\nAfter 5 years of living with that knowledge, I still can't accept it and I cry everytime I hear her on the phone being drunk.\nI did everything I could to help her, I found a therapist for her, paid for all of those sessions, I regularly call her to talk to her and listen to all her problems and make sure that she doesn't feel unheard. I visit her regularly. I talked to both her and my father numerous times but nothing seems to give long term results. \n\nI no longer tell her any of the issues I have because I fear of her reaction and I know she is unstable, so she is completely unaware of my fertility issues and IVF journey my husband and I just embarked on. I would love so much to have my mother back because that is something I want to share with her, but I can't because I am scared that this will be just another trigger for her.\n\nYesterday she told me that we don't deserve such a mother, that she is a disappointment and that she's ashamed of herself, that she will give her best to be a better mother but she can't promise. I fear after this call that she might do something to herself.\n\nSorry for the long post, but how do you think I should deal with this? I feel like this stress is eating me up, to the point where my periods started being irregular lately and my ob GYN thinks this is stress-related. I can't just stop communicating with mom, but also there is not much else I can do to help her. What would you do in my situation? Have you had a similar situation and how did you deal with it?\n\nJust to mention, I also visit a therapist and it has helped a lot, but I would say not enough because this trauma keeps getting bigger for me every day.",

        "text": "I know that’s a loaded question, but here is the dilemma I am facing. I was with my ex on and off for 15 years. Throughout highschool into my early 30s. He pretty well scrambled my self worth, my own emotions and my trust in other. \n\nI am now with my absolutely amazing BF. He was my friend for years, and I absolutely adore him. I trust him with every bit of my heart. We communicate extremely well, but like anyone, at times we don’t see eye to eye. Occasionally he’ll make me realize I reacted irrationally (my words, not his.) Sometimes I find myself projecting my insecurities, or emotions onto him. \n\nExample: I’m having a bad day, and I’m tired. I start looking at things negative. I become nit picky, almost like I WANT to fight. This is something that I notice I do, from time to time, and I’m working on it. \n\nThis is my issue. I am a very reasonable person (so I think LOL.) I did a LOT of soul searching, self reflection and discovery, after my separation. I know I still have work to do on myself, and I’ve been enjoying that! I finally feel like I understand myself better than ever. Sometimes when my boyfriend and I get into disagreements, he will make me realize something I didn’t think of. Almost like it snaps me out of the fight. Not all the time, but sometimes, I’m immediately met with this internal distrust feeling. Almost as if I’m becoming defensive because he’s trying to gaslight me. \n\nI’m talking about him genuinely making me realize I assume negatively of him, without reason. It’s specifically when there is a break down in communication. Recently, I thought he was coming over, but instead of just asking him “are you coming over?” I didn’t specifically tell him I was home, waited around my house pissy, then fell asleep. When I finally expressed my frustration, he explained he “was waiting for me to let him know, and then I feel asleep…” \n\nI’m trying to come up with trivial examples. Mind you, I communicate to him my frustrations rationally, even when my emotions make me a little more irrational than normal… Anytime I express to him my needs, like needing space when I have an anxiety attack, or how I need to have a breather before I can discuss conflict, he respects it 100% I hate that I keep feeling as if I need to put a wall between us, or that he’s trying to brain wash me, when in reality he’s just communicating healthily with me. I’m not use to that so I always assume nefarious motives, when he’s never given me a reason. \n\nAlso I high af so if that doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry. Lolol.",

        "text": "I really need some advice.\n\nI worked for years in Eastern Europe, mostly in the NGO and humanitarian sector. When the war in Ukraine started a year ago, I was evacuated and the program I’d built over the past ten years was shut down as (understandably) the focus turned to the war. I was suddenly back in North America after about a decade away. Publishers started contacting me about writing a book. So after a few weeks of sleeping in guest rooms, I took up a job that would allow me lots of time to write: I would work as a live-in caregiver for a young woman with special needs for a few hours a day, and have the rest of the day to write. I would have my own basement apartment in her house. In exchange for my work, I wouldn’t have to pay rent or utilities or groceries. I would be able to focus on regrouping after the stressful, sudden evacuation, and just write the first book.\n\nFor a month or two, it was great. But there was one problem: her mother, the person who hired me, is absolutely nuts, a liar, and sadistic. My basement apartment, it soon became apparent, was poorly maintained. It lacks basic safety features (e.g. no porchlight outside my entrance; old stairs without a handrail). So a few months ago, I slipped backwards on the stairs in my room and severely injured my spine. I knew immediately it would be a life changing injury. I was in and out of the ER. Then, two weeks later, I slipped and fell again. The mother is a packrat and uses the area outside my entrance as extra storage space. She also wanted to cut costs on utilities so had removed many of the lightbulbs in the house, including those on the stairs. I slipped and fell over one of her old appliances being stored on my dark stairs.\n\nSo I had this terrible back pain. But I was still determined not to have my life ruined by this, so I stayed, on painkillers. But problems continued. A few weeks later, I woke up in the middle of the night and there was a gigantic rat in my room. It turns out there were holes in various places in the walls that the mother had either papered over or barely covered up with furniture.\n\nSo I was freaked out but didn’t have anywhere to go. I cannot afford to live in this city, I don’t have a full-time job (and there is nothing relevant to my work here), and I have multiple book deadlines. The mother is cruel. She replaced the porchlight but established draconian rules for when I can use it.\n\nSo I decide that I want to leave, but know I need to make a plan, maybe leave in several months when I have an appropriate and sustainable exit strategy. To cope, and to figure out if I even like the city, I decide to spend as much time as possible outside of the house. So I go on dates, see old friends, work at cafes late into the night. All while still nursing this severe back injury. I realize that I hate this place now, that it’s not for me.\n\nI went to my first physical therapy appointment a few days ago, and that was a real wakeup call. I started sobbing as soon as the physical therapist brushed her fingertips on my spine; all of the pain and fury about being poorly treated came to the fore. You probably won’t be surprised to hear that my boss is also very demeaning to me, frequently puts me down, ignores recommendations from doctors not to have me do repetitive motions, violates my boundaries etc. At the physical therapy appointment, all of it came back. I also discovered that I have lots of nerve damage, and that I’m nowhere near healed.\n\nI came back to the house after that appointment crying, and wrote the mother some texts explaining why. But suddenly she is very different. It’s like being in the twilight zone, rewriting history in legalese: “you had a bad back when you came here to render services in exchange for living freely, and your mild slip only exacerbated an existing bad back injury”. (I had once told her that my back hurt *from working at the computer*!!). So suddenly I don’t have a traumatic spinal injury from falling down the stairs, suddenly there’s a whole new story about it. She starts gaslighting about everything: the dates and locations of the fall (e.g. because I fell on the steps right outside my door the second time, I fell “at a location outside of the house”). I cannot tell you how triggering it was.\n\nThat same night, the rats came back. It had been a month since I last saw them and she still hadn’t patched up the holes in the wall. She was also completely dismissive about it when I informed her: “I’m sorry that this house, which suits everyone else just fine, isn’t to your liking”.\n\nSo I need to get out. Even if I don’t have the perfect exit strategy. The blatant lying about my injury is too much. My physical therapist doesn’t know if I’ll even be able to heal at the house, given the traumatic nature of the accident and the fact that I’m aware of how dangerous and unsanitary it still is.\n\nOne option: I have an old trusted friend who has offered me his apartment in an Eastern European city for the next three months, free of charge. He’s elsewhere so it’s totally empty. I’d have no rent and a big beautiful apartment for myself to heal and write in. I am so tempted but the problem is: I feel like it’s a failure, as I just came from (vaguely) that same corner of Europe. I made such a huge move home after so many years, and to return after just one year seems like such a step backwards. I've also been totally unsettled since the war started a year ago, and it seems like this is just another move to yet another temp place?\n\nAnother option: I could work really hard to try to get a job and my own apartment here, but the reality is I don't like it. I really do not want to live here. It's also highly likely that I would not be able to do it financially, as this is one of the most expensive places in the world. And I do see my future back in Europe at some point.\n\nSo what do you think? Do I take my friend up on his offer to use his empty flat to recover and write, even though it’s a step backwards and means uprooting myself again? Or do I try to tough it out here at the hell house in the hopes of figuring out a more solid, longterm strategy?",

Like it says in the title, I’ve either worn scrubs, or worked in shelter style  or day program style environments where torn jeans and hoodies are completely fine. \n\nMy typical style out of office is a lot of long skirts and floral dresses in summer, and in winter more basic, like leggings/jeans and a long sleeve shirt or big sweater, lots of yoga wear. \n\nWhat stores do you recommend looking at?  Any basic pieces you all recommend? And maybe a weird question, but like- how often is it ok to repeat outfits? Like if I only have 2 weeks worth of clothes would that be odd in an office environment?",

        "text": "So for the new year, I decided that I needed to make a couple temporary changes:\n\n•No social media\n•No caffeine \n\nI can’t even begin to tell you how almost therapeutic it was to give these things up. I had deleted Instagram and dating apps about halfway through 2022 but gave up all social media in January. Prior to January, I was on Reddit for literally hours every day. I scrolled Facebook videos. It’s basically all I did besides work and my workout class. Man, did I need it. I realized it wasn’t giving me the fulfillment like I thought it did. So, I filled my time with other things like working on making small updates to my house, reading a couple of books, and actually watching a tv show/movie instead of scrolling my phone the entire time. \n\nNo caffeine? Well the first 5 days were 5 days of a straight headache. Awful. But after that, I had way more energy. And energy all day. I didn’t have that 3pm crash. My head feels clearer. Sleeping hasn’t been the best in years but def better. Also, less bloating. I think I’ll stay caffeine free!\n\nI’m happy to be back on Reddit and see other women with the same thoughts and ideas but also read new thoughts and ideas. But also, not scrolling for hours on end. So I guess my point is, it’s good to take a break with something every now and again. \n\nHappy New Year!",

Everything we do bills, vacations, home projects all come out of our shared account. I bring in about 4k a month and she 2k. Recently she picked up an additional nanny job (about 10 hours a week) just to get out of the house and for some extra income. We agreed to split this extra $800 or so a month evenly to use as fun money. If it's something above and beyond our bills that we want (extra shoes, golf clubs, etc.) we use this money instead of our shared account. I decided I wanted to throw some of my funds in the stock market to possibly make a few extra bucks as I'm not a big spender. My stocks have been doing well and I've made a few extra hundred dollars. My partner believes any additional funds being made above what was already split should be split as well. What are your thoughts? Should this extra income be shared as well? That's for taking the time to read.",

        "text": "Hi there,\nDon’t know how I came to this. However I don’t know what to do. \n\nI am in my late 30’s. So we went to school with this girl at age 8 and then she left. Let’s call her B. She comes back in grade 6 and I move to another city the same year. All I remember about her she was an “outcast” among girls. I was the only who didn’t bother about her existence. All the rest were bullying. She wasn’t all miserable though. Would push back. That’s all I remembered about her.\n\nI wasn’t really in touch with co-students. But last year they found me to celebrate the graduation anniversary. I couldn’t go, however she reaches out and I thought it won’t hurt to chat a little. God, how I regret about it. I will leave the stories how I tried my best to be polite. All I understood is that we don’t have anything in common than 2 separate years at school. We’re different in every damn thing about interests and personalities. Different experiences. She doesn’t understand. I ran out of all excuses to avoid seeing her. But I live far and I just waited until I go back. I saw her twice. \n\nI lost my mom a couple months ago. I had to organize everything and apart from regular funeral, we traditionally have so many post-mortem ceremonies. I didn’t have time or space to grief properly. My mom was the closest person to me. B comes for funeral learning about it from social media. (The funeral is on very next day after death) and almost yells: “why you didn’t tell me”? I’m devastated and she wasn’t on my mind at all. She’s like: “we’re close to each other”. \n\nShe attended all the ceremonies even those that meant for immediate family only. Would stay till late night. I tried to say: this is not appropriate but she’s deaf and blind. She would walk around my moms house, check the rooms. Making comments on menu, on number of people who came to offer their condolences etc. By mourning tradition, we can’t celebrate or fight so I kept trying to stay polite. It obviously didn’t work. \nWhen the last ceremony is over. Me and my siblings took some time to stay just for us. Before everyone went back each own way. \nB calls me and says: “hey let’s hang out, the last ceremony is over. You can do it”. \n“I’ll come to stay overnight”. “I’ll come and we’ll make tiktoks”. \n\nI responded that It’s not that ceremonies kept me from entertaining, I was genuinely grieving and still am. That I didn’t want to see anyone including herself . Nor I found that her comments and decision to come overnight and ffs I don’t even have a TT account were proper. And I am grieving!!!! \nNothing works. She would call me every day multiple times. All calls are ignored. It’s been three weeks since I am back from home country. And I keep getting texts. I ignore. I blocked her. She pops up somewhere else. Like social media, emails. Linkedin. Like I didn’t ignore her like I didn’t say I didn’t want to see her. I only feel safe because I’m continents away. But damn this is annoying. \n\nSorry for the long read, errors (English isn’t my first language) and thank you.",
