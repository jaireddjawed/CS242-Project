(Some of us called him Angel bc he seemed so innocent.)\n                \n He would always try to help where he could.\n But he never wanted to be our leader, despite\nhim beeing the strongest.\n\nSo on my 15th birthday, we all went to my favourite\nlake. As it  was winter and we were dumb kids,\n we  wanted to skate on it. So, after we put on the\nshoe-thingys we all went on the lake. At first it  seemed so safe, but after a while we had an\n even \"Better\" idea. I would go back and watch all of them perform various tricks on the ice. They took turns doing piourettes jumps and whatnot. While one of them did their trick, the others watched next to me. Then there came Angel's turn. I do not remember, what he said, but it was something in the lines of: \"Y'all had your fun, now I will show the best thing you ever saw!\" For better view, we went on a hill close by. He first only drew a few rounds around the middle, but then he started to jump and spin on the ice. Once, twice, thrice. But then suddenly he seemed to loose control and hit the already cracked ice with his head. Before we could do anything, the ice suddenly broke around him, plunging his seemingly unconcious body into the extremely cold water. We just stood there literally frozen in shock.\n\nThe last and only time he would have needed our help, we just stood there.\nWe agreed to never tell anyone. The group didn't last long without him. Almost all of us went seperate ways, some of us got therapy, some did not (as far as I know). Today I am friends with one of them.\nI do not know how most of the others are tbh, but I hope they got over him.\n\nThanks for listening to my story.",

I am not sure if it is because of the color of my skin or the way I dress, but the fact remains that I feel constantly judged and stereotyped so recently, I started to feel the urge to steal things just because if their going to call me a thief might as well be one. It sounds crazy, I know, but the pressure of stereotypes can do that to a person. I would steal small things, like candy or trinkets, just to feel like I was in control.\n\nBut the truth is, I know that stealing is wrong. It's not just illegal, but it's also morally and ethically wrong. It goes against everything that I stand for, and everything that I want to be as a person. I feel guilty for giving in to these feelings and for betraying my own values. I fell into the trap of being what white people say i am and the reason i’m comfortable with sharing on my main is because i’m not that person anymore",

        "text": "From the ages of like 3 to 13 I would steal alllll the time. Nothing from stores or places where I thought I could get into legal trouble, but I would steal from people or bags or anything left unattended no matter the location. \nDuring school is when I would get my biggest scores. During nap time or lunch I would sneak away and go through bags taking whatever interested me. \n\nUsually gum, candy, pens, makeup,hand sanitizers, toys or jewelry. If I could manage it, I would take small pieces technology. I would steal the item, watch and wait over a day to see the reaction of the person I stole from then claim it as mine if they didn’t make a big deal out of it. Even if they did, I would just wait it out or hide the item on my person. \n\nI often would steal and hide it in a bag or desk of someone who was disliked then grab my item at the end of the day so I wouldn’t be suspected. The biggest thing I used to steal was those bath and body hand sanitizers that girls used to carry on their bags. My parents wouldn’t get me one so I stole them from others. I would switch the cases and stickers so that if someone thought I stole theirs they couldn’t prove it because it had a different case and sticker. \n\nI used to love bringing the item that I stole back to the person that I stole it from and brag about it. I was never caught so I just kept doing it. As I got older around middle school, I graduated to stealing from teachers. I would steal food and candy or anything that I wanted to have. \n\nI would share my winnings with my best friend at the time and we stole jolly ranchers from our history teacher every other day until their stash ran out. I stole during their lunch period or while they were helping another student. \n\nI think the “best” thing I ever stole was this limited edition Littlest Pet Shop video game device or these limited edition Bayblades. I’m sure I’m forgetting something though. i would always have random items and my parents couldn’t figure out where I was getting them from. I kinda regret it now but I never understood why I went through that phase. I was non verbal and a very sneaky kid with a cute face and a innocent demeanor so guess I just got away with it.",
