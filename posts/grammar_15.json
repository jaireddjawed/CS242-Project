        "text": "**Context stuff:**\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, I've been reading a book about grammar called *Grammar 101* in order to understand English better in order to pass my English classes with an A. There are two chapters I could not understand, no matter how much googling, researching, and reading I did. These sections work in tandem to create the problems that have led me here today.\n\n**Participles**\n\nMy book described participles, a type of verbal, as words that \"can act as adjectives, direct objects, and as part of a multipart verb\". Now, if you want to jump the gun and forage DuckDuckGo, you'll find that many different sources either define participles as verbals that act as: adjectives; part of multipart verbs and adjectives; or all the definitions explained in the book. The variety in opinion is in fact so great, I can't tell which source is correct.\n\n**Gerunds and Participles**\n\nThe uncertainty of what a participle is made this next problem so much harder: The chapter following the one about participles was about gerunds. Gerunds are nouns, which can be a direct object, *which is also what a participle is*. I've searched for the internet to see if this means a word can be a gerund and a participle, but every article/video I found comparing these two word types described participles as a verbal which acts as an adjective, contrary to a third of the articles I've read.\n\n**What I'm asking for**\n\nI need legitimate sources for American English that covers both the definition of a participle, and if a word can be gerund and a participle at the same time. Also, if participles turn out to be just a verb, what the verbals/verbs in multipart verb are \"should have *swam.*\"\n\n**tldr;**\n\nI can't figure out what a participle is, and I can't figure out if word can be a gerund and a participle.",

The quote that follows a reporting verb acts as the direct object, so that comma that follows the reporting verb separates a verb from its direct object, which is to say it interrupts a major constituent of a sentence. Nevertheless, all grammar books indicate it is necessary. You cannot separate any other constituent of a sentence from a syntactic complement.\n\nIn addition, I'm also curious about the discrepancy between period and comma placement in American and British usage.

It's needed since so many regions have developed their own slang for plural you -- y'all, you guys, youse. \n\nWhere I live (Canada) youse is strictly used by people without formal education/working-class people. So there's definitely a stigma to it, ridiculous as that is. Which is why I think there should be a movement to make it official! Who's with me??",
