I've looked at fan controllers and would really prefer to just use a potentiometer. I'm very comfortable with soldering, measuring voltage, and even doing the footwork if you can point me in the right direction :) So far I've run the Ohms law calculation and it looks like I'll need a pot that's rated for at least 4 watts (been looking at 5 watts since I don't think they make 4 watt ones). So my next question is what ohmage should I be looking at? Thats where the hangup is lol. I'm not sure where the startup voltage for this fan is either since this was off of a VERY cheapo chinese pc psu.",

        "text": "Disclaimer. I'm quite new to verilog and FPGAs in general.\n\nI have 40 asynchronous inputs to 40 input pins of an FPGA, don't ask why. I need to feed these into a synchronous FSM on the FPGA.\nThese inputs need to be latched, as in, if the input ever goes high, the output for that pin will remain high until a reset signal is asserted.\n\nI've written a Verilog prototype input for a single pin to try to understand the timings. The asynchronous input has a pulse length equivalent to about 1000 clock cycles, and any input latency is not important. The 40 input signals are asynchronous from each other, as well as the FPGA.\n\nVerilog:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jY1l6gX.png\n\nwhich synthesises to the following netlist/logic\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qzcx83S.png\n\nA few questions. \n\n1. I have a double cascaded flip-flop on the input which I have heard is necessary to block any metastability of the output. Do I need to specify some timing requirements on the second flip-flop to stop it double-clocking the input?\n\n2. Do I need the second flip-flop (verilog lines 16-18) as there is a third flip flop performing the latch operation? I think I do because of the reset signal into the mux's isn't synchronised to the input. But I'm not sure if this is important.\n\n3. I am a little space constrained on the FPGA, some of the asynchronous inputs can be put through some combinational logic to cut down the number of lines that need to be synchronised. If say I had a number of asynchronous lines going into a multi-way OR gate, which then gets fed into the synchronisation flip-flops. As the inputs are asynchronous from each other, as well as from the FPGA, what would happen if two of them changed at the same time on the input of the OR gate? Does combinational logic have setup and hold times like flip-flops do?\n\n4. Is there a better way to do this?\n\nEdit: whoops, I'm actually using a MAX V CPLD.",

        "author": "cdrh1",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/8pe0x1/please_help_me_in_understanding_the/",
        "text": "How is an ISA written? Is it just a bunch of binary combination encoding presets that is stored onto RAM? In other words, is it basically a “dictionary” of binary being defined as an instruction ‘word’ such as add? Once the instruction ‘word’ is recognized, does that mean an action is defined/assigned in that ‘word’? For example, let’s say 101010 is some encoding in x86 that = add, but then add = 111000, which is some electrical signal of add, then 111000 = action, then action = using ALU take register 1 and 2 and adds them? Also, is storing the result part of that action of add or is it it’s own separate thing? My guess is that it’s part of the action of add.\n\n\nFrom my understanding and using my analogy of a dictionary , I’ve thought about it in this way. Instead of thinking of it as one complicated dictionary with meanings on meanings on meanings, I’ve split it into two dictionaries: one dictionary for the encoding of your ISA (the opcodes/instruction format) and the other dictionary for what that encoding means, meaning it’s actions. There’s a microcontroller unit with a ROM aspect that is the dictionary for my so called “action”, which are the electrical signals that correlate to decoded instruction. Then there’s your ISA, set of instructions, that’s located on your RAM which is a dictionary for the instructions when the opcode being called. Am I correct? Please tell me I am. Follow up, how is the ISA loaded into RAM to begin with? What tells it to do that? Is it the microcontroller unit? Also, how does an ISA even go about naming and defining certain registers to have a certain roles and functionalities? I’m genuinely confused. Is the ISA like an OS where as soon as the computer boots, the instructions get stored into RAM (if so, how?) and these registers immediately recognize their names and roles? I definitely feel like I have some sort of misconceptions and misunderstandings here.\n\n\nThen there's also the instruction cycle which I learned about separately. It's fetch, decode, execute. What is making it do that? How is the cycle being executed? Is that programmed through the ISA? Is it some kind of hardwired thing at the microarchitecture level? If so, please explain.\n\n\nLastly, how exactly does the implementation process of the ISA and microarchitecture work? Do you create the ISA first then implement that onto the microarchitecture level? Or is it created by working hand and hand with each other? By that I mean, does Intel have two teams: one dedicated on creating the ISA and one on creating the design of the microarchitecture(hardware)? If the answer is two separate teams, I do not understand how you can go about creating your digital logic(hardware) efficiently without working close together with the ISA team. Even after creating and finishing their product, how do they implement it with one another? Please help me understand the implementation process :(\n\nEDIT: I understand that these are nooby questions, but please don't downvote. I just want some help :(",

I don't have \"professional\" experience, but I tinkered a lot in high school and I was the number one xbox repair man in high school. Secondly, there seems to only be Warehouse/Factory maintenance technician positions. There are no \"ENTRY LEVEL\" jobs around here, it seems like every position wants a ton of experience, which I don't have. I still apply to jobs that I fit the description for, minus the experience. There is also a lot more electro-mechanical positions in my area. \n\nI am planning on finishing up a second Associate's degree part time in Electrical Instrumentation(one course left), and take a PLC Maintenance Certification Course. My current position is with a University where I work as a Research Lead and even fit the bill to be called a Systems Engineer (So I've been told by another Systems Engineer). I feel like my experience listed is more than satisfactory for a lot of these positions I am applying for, but the basic HR reps don't really know that and I know they don't know that so I purposely use key words and phrases on my Resume to get it pushed through and i'm still failing.\n\nI did get a phone call to be placed with a company in Colorado, but I don't have money to move yet. I Want to get into the field and gain the experience, save the money, go somewhere with more job opportunities. In the future I do plan on getting my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, but for now I need to save the money to move. \n\nHow do I make myself stand out? What job titles should I be looking for other than the obvious ones? \n\n\nTL:DR; Just graduated and can't find jobs and am not getting phone calls or interviews. ",

        "text": "Hey ladies and gents. I have a startup that has developed a technology that does a very specific thing... I wont get into what the thing is, but I will explain what it does to accomplish 'the thing'.\n\nMy product creates a high voltage (1000v/cm2), higher than normal frequency (\\~3khz) electric field. It does that via two custom transformers that we've had designed, then redesigned, then redesigned again. We are on revision 3 and every time they spin the board, it's another month from board design, ordering and assembly. The circuitry has worked just fine when they use much larger transformers (that obviously wouldn't fit) but when we custom order transformers from now two different companies specializing in HV micro transformers... they seem to be the issue.  \n\n\\*EDIT\\* \\- the board allows us to adjust the voltage output... forgot to mention that\n\nThis was his email to me today:\n\n*Everything on Rev 4 besides the transformer is working as expected. The real transformer is not responding the same as in the simulation. This is really confusing. We are trying to find the discrepancy between the real transformer and the simulated one. I will keep you updated as we learn more. The result of this discrepancy is a higher power draw than the system can handle. In order to reduce power, the system works on resonance. It has to be tuned to match the transformer so the power is reused and not converted to heat. In simulation the current circuit works very well. In reality the power draw is too high. I am really hoping to have answers for you soon.  I'll let you know as soon as we have them.*\n\nThis has taken a lot longer than we had anticipated even using the (multiple by 3 rule of thumb). For one reason to another the main components on this build have not been playing nicely... it has been a huge drain on the money I have set aside for this and I am going to go broke with each revision if we can't fix this and get a working unit to me. We had three working prototypes that are very rough compared to the finished product, all of which worked great, but had slightly different builds. The current device is  very sexy, think apple or samsun quality looks and build (two large retailers have agreed to a small order run based on my demos at a handful of places you do demos like this).\n\nThis is what it looks like for now... I can't post the GERBER file here because without the transformer build/specs, it wouldn't help regardless, but even if I could, that's my entire companies roadmap to build this device. Hoping someone looks at this and says, 'I'm experienced in HV and I know what these components are and I may have an idea or could take a look'.\n\n\\*edit\\* \\- there is a secondary PCB that controls this product... it allows you to adjust the voltage from 5kv to 7kv in increments of 400v (shown below). I dont know if the adjustability could affect it in any way, but I did forget to mention that particular part.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xytoaw3k69211.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hwlwv2s32e211.png",

I'm saying all of this to try to show where my experience and interests are.  \n\nSo I guess I have a few questions. The first is what are the main differences between an EE and a CpE degree? From what I understand a EE degree tends to focus more on circuit theory, while the CpE degree trades some of the electronics classes for programming and computer architecture.  \n\nI already buy textbooks to learn circuit analysis and ASM in my spare time so would it be better for me to go for a CpE degree? Or should I focus on an EE degree, since it would be easier given my obsession towards electronics?  \n\nOh, also, if I were to pursue a CpE degree which college would be the best for learning it?

So I’m worried about being able to afford to go and if having the masters degree will off balance any further loans I could take out.\n\nSo I’m considering joining the workforce immediately and hoping I’ll eventually land employment where a masters degree could be sponsored.  \n\nMy two years of research at my university have been focused on more advanced wireless communications techniques and systems based around pre-coding and space-time coding—and many of the jobs I desire require higher education.  Although I’m open to other jobs.\n\nSorry, I know this is a bit scatter brained—I just have a lot on my mind and I’m trying to weigh all my options and hope I land on a concrete decision.\n\nSo, I guess my question is... do any of you have any advice, whether it’s from your own similar experience or anyone else you’ve met or seen in this situation?\n\nEdit:  Thank you for all of your input and advice.  I truly appreciate and love this community.  I’ve decided to apply to as many jobs as possible, and also to contact the professors at the electrical engineering department to inquire of RA positions.  Once I get some calls back and more information, hopefully I’ll have enough choices to make a good decision.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/8o1byf/is_a_double_major_in_electrical_and_computer/",
        "text": "Hey guys, so I am an electrical engineering student at my university with a concentration in computer engineering. I recently added a double major of computer engineering because it would only be an additional 5 computer engineering classes, considering my EE degree is concentrated in CompE. I have finished all classes for my EE degree in May so I’m graduating in the Fall after taking my remaining CompE classes. Another big reason why I picked up this double major was so I can be able to get an internship in the summer, which would count as a technical elective, so now I only need four classes to fulfill the double major. \n\n\nOnly issue now is, I’m not even sure if it’s worth it anymore. While doing my concentration in CompE with my EE degree I took all the fun classes and my school is so limited on Computer Engineering technical electives, I have to take grad level classes. Theres only three undergrad CompE electives at my school and they are systems programming, digital image processing, and digital signal processing. Those classes don’t really sound interesting to me except for DSP. And two of those classes overlap! So now I’m in a situation where I’d have to request taking a grad level course to count and then I’d probably have to do an independent study with a professor to count as a course. I did land an internship and I like it so far. Ideally I’d like to ask if I can stay longer. \n\n\nI can finish this internship, come back home and do one more semester of school then graduate in December with a double major in CompE and EE. What im thinking of doing is requesting to stay at the internship longer, then coming back home and just graduating with the degree I’ve already fulfilled. It doesn’t really feel like a double major, feels more like I’m a CompE who took a couple of EE classes. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think this double major is worth it? Will it help with employability? Or is EE with comp E concentration sufficient? I am lightly considering a masters degree in CompE too, would that make my double major irrelevant? ",

        "text": "Hey all, it was music/audio that got me into ECE and I've done a ton of independent projects/study, but I would love to work my way into the industry professionally.\n\nA little background:\n\n* A.S. in EET \\(electronics tech\\) completed\n* B.S. in ECE \\(three semesters left\\)\n* Currently doing a co\\-op in broadcast engineering \\(radio\\)\n* Currently in Columbus, OH, with my family in Pittsburgh, PA\n\nThis co\\-op is great because I'm developing my understanding of various systems \\(audio, RF, power, IT, etc.\\) but I really want to do more circuit design. My employer has a 2 year development program \\(after graduation\\) that would place me as a radio market engineering manager which would be cool because of all the travel I would do and it would sort of be a fast track in the industry, but I feel like I would hate to leave circuit design as a hobby instead of building my career on it.\n\nAnyone have any advice on how to get into that industry? What kind of company to look out for, how to snag an internship or a permanent position after graduation? My dream job would be working for a company like Roland who makes electronic musical instruments and amplifiers and such, but I am certainly open to other industries that still utilize a lot of analog circuit design. I am not against DSP but I also don't have any experience with it yet.",

The Ryzen embedded CPUs seem like an interesting product, and I'd be interested in experimenting with one. Unfortunately I don't quite feel like waiting/paying for their board, so I'd like to acquire one to experiment with.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nUnfortunately, that's where the problem starts. So far I can find no vendors that sell these chips. I'm assuming you may need to contact AMD directly, but before I'd do that I would at least like to have some knowledge about the workings of them and maybe a prototype schematic. That's where I encounter the next problem, though. Aside from some basic tables of specs AMD has listed on their website, I can find no datasheets on any in-depth aspects of these chips. Does anyone know where I could? I haven't found any PDFs or something on AMD's website, nor have I found anything by just searching.",

        "text": "So i am designing a split keyboard where each row on each hand is a separate PCB. There will be four PCBs that connect to a thumb cluster that has the main microcontroller. Each PCB has 7 keys for a total of 28 keys and the thumb cluster with 5 buttons. So the thumb clusters microcontroller needs to scan a total of 33 keys split across 5 PCBs and then send that data off to the microcontrolle that connects to the USB.\n\nInitially i though it would be smart to put an I/O expander on each of the row PCBs and then all i'd need to do is wire a single I2C bus that branches off to each PCB. But i am hesitant because i am wondering if this will be very slow for the keyscanning? Even fastmode I2C is 400kb/s. So back of the hand calculations go like this:\n\n\\(400e3 bits/s\\) / \\(8 bits per byte \\* 4 bytes per transcation \\[slave address write, command byte, slave address read, return data\\] \\* 4 transactions \\[one per row PCB\\]\\) = 3125 keyscans/second from the row PCBs. Then i need to add in the 5 thumb button scans \\(very easy\\); but this all assumes no overhead. There will a lot more going on when i have to interpret the scancodes and ship it off to the main USB microcontroller.\n\nWhat are the fastest methods for scanning keys on separate PCBs that also reduces number of inter\\-PCB wires? Are shift registers much faster? What sort of overhead for the the processing of the scancodes should i expect?\n\nIf the method i described with the I/O expanders on 400kb/s fastmode I2C is actually fast enough to effectively scan the keys can someone give me some reassurance that it wont limit the keyboard and that i did my calculations correctly?\n\nI realize i can use SPI for much faster transmission but then i have 7 wires \\(CS, SCK, SDA, MOSI, MISO, Vcc, GND\\) going to each board as opposed to four \\(SDA, SCL, Vcc, GND\\) for I2C and i am trying to keep the wiring between boards to a minimum. In addition SPI would need a CS line PER row from the main micro whereas I2C is a common bus.",
