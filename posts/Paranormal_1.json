        "text": "So one night after dinner I took my dog for a walk. It was 11:30 pm. there is a river side nearby so I went there but when I reached there I felt someone was watching me. It was wired cause I come here at this hour very often and I've never seen anyone before. At first I did not pay any attention to it but after a while it felt a bit wired since I was alone there with my dog I decided to go back home. On the way back home I saw a crooked man standing around 7-8 feet tall which was again very wired. I was quite dark so I just crossed him and went home. Now from my room's window we can clearly see the front door of my house. The moon light falls directly into my room. so I was about to sleep when I looked out the window and I saw that man......smiling. He standing right under the street light but he was still black. It felt like I was watching darkness in person. After seeing that I was not able to sleep. but I didn't get out of bed until the sunlight entered my room. I thought I was hallucinating so I ignored it. After some days I suddenly wake up, it was 3:45 am I woke up but was not able to move, and then I saw him standing in the corner of my room he was laughing, his hair is curly and long it covers his eyes, he is totally black as if He is the darkness! I could already hear his laugh and it was hurting my ears but at that moment I took the worst decision I tried to look into his eyes. I was not able to but it felt like it is his weakness cause after a minute or two he left when I started searching for his eyes. After that night some of my closed ones have also seen him. Idk what is it I've searched all over the internet but I can't find anything about him so I'm here, if someone have ever seen aor know something like this please tell me what it is.",

        "text": "This happened a few months ago.\n\nEvery night at approximately the same time (about 4:40-5:00 a.m.) I would hear 3 knocks on my front door. At first I would wake up my dad to go and investigate since it was so early in the morning and around this time my city was experiencing a crime spree and my dog would bark which solidified the fact that they were real knocks, not just a product of my imagination. \n\nMy dad would get up, check our security camera’s since they would send a notification to his phone if any motion was detected and it always came up negative. And to put it into perspective, it can register movement from the end of my driveway so, logically, anyone who could come to the door should have been detected. He would then walk outside to our driveway to see if he could spot anyone but he never did. Eventually I just started to ignore it since I’m used to unexplainable things happening around me.\n\nThis all started after I had multiple surgeries on my kidneys and I’ve had things follow me from places before. After getting tired of having my sleep messed up everyday, I used frankincense and a medallion to expel anything that was following me. This worked and around a week later it stopped.\n\nThis is just one of the many paranormal things that has happened to me and I’ll probably post more experiences in the future since it absolutely fascinates me.",

Not my first time here but i promised more stories last time so here is another one.\n\nEverything began as i was studying at a friend's house, everything was okay and we ended up after a few hours just chatting. It was getting late and she proposed that i stay for the night. So i end up sleeping at her house. We decide after studying to watch an horror movie (Annabelle, such a masterpiece !). Once the movie end, i decide to go to the bathroom.\n\nOn my way back to her room, i see comming up the stairs, a black shadow crawling like an animal that run in front of me and get in the first room. Al little bit curious, i turn on the light to see what it is thinking it's one of her cats. I then remember as i enter the empty room that she doesn't have a cat of that color. That gave me shivers and i got back to her room fast.\n\nShe sees my face and ask what's going on. I tell her what just happened and her face goes dark as she ask me \"So...you saw it too\". Then she explains that some of her friends that stayed during the night Saw the exact same thing as me and that she saw it too.\n\nI don't know what it was and i'm not scared, just so curious. Like.

        "text": "I have a true story to tell...\n\nI am not an atheist, nor am I a religious person. I just figure even if that sort of thing exists, it does whether I believe in it or not and it’s most likely beyond our current evolutionary capacity to comprehend. That being said, I have experienced MANY strange things in my life. Enough to know there is more going on than just our physical reality. The story I’m about to share with you is 100% true and happened about 10 years ago if memory serves. I was in my late 20’s. It is by far the most terrifying thing I have ever personally experienced. Here it goes…it’s a long read. \n\n     I once invited a couple of religious Protestant friends of mine to my cabin by the lake in PA. We had a small fire going in the back of my house near the woods and we were telling ghost stories. I have so many personal ghost stories my friend apparently felt comfortable enough to tell me they could see angels and demons...she even said there was an angel on my roof and demons in the woods behind us. naturally I was very scepticle. In fact I thought she was a little crazy lol. But when I said I’ve heard more things than I’ve seen, she asked if I would like to see them. I said yes thinking nothing of it. After all whats she going to do…prove it? She started playing a religious hymn on her phone and her boyfriend started praying and speaking in tongues. Keep in mind it’s nighttime…in the woods. All of the sudden, while the song hit the chorus, “holy, holy, holy”, the earth itself beneath my feet and in the forest behind me shook like thunder or an earthquake and I could hear it rumble (it was most definitely neither, it was a beautiful night). Wide-eyed, I asked what that was and she very matter-of-factly told me, “you know what that was”. This occurred a total of 3 times, each time as the chorus hit, “holy, holy, holy”. She proceeded to tell me they now know, that I know they are there and they will reveal themselves to me in their own time.\n\nCut to about 2 months later and I’m camping in an upstate NY state forest. I was with one friend. I told him that same story at about 1:00am in a very dark pine forest. About 15 minutes later, while I preparing an MRE, the entire forest went eerily silent...a deafening silence (You know when it’s so quiet your ears are ringing?), When my friend says, “what the hell is that?!” I look up and I see a silent glowing red light descend from ABOVE the trees and it settles into the woods about 30-40 yards away from our camp and disappears. As we crept around the small fire to see if we could get a glimpse of whatever just descended upon us, two large GLOOWING RED eyes peered out from behind a tree. When I say glowing, I mean they were emanating a deep red light, not reflecting light...the entire eye was red, no retina/cornea, etc. it did not blink either. And when I say large I mean inches wide. Whatever it was it was watching us. These eyes watched us for about 5 minutes...we watched back. I shone a flashlight to see if I could get a good look at it...no body that I could see, but the eyes remained. It would then slowly creep back behind the tree and disappear as the normal sounds of the forest returned. \n\nLastly, I told another friend this entire story YEARS later and we tried to replicate the experience at my lake house, including the song…nothing happened while we were there. BUT upon driving home to NJ (at night on a country road), we decided to turn on the radio.  Guess the first thing we heard when we turned it on? Literally the FIRST thing…\n\n“Holy, holy, holy…”\n\nTo this day I regard that experience as a religious experience, and had done some research as to what it might be. First thought...barred owl. I had seen two in the woods during daylight flying through the trees on the way to the campsite. I determined that the eyes being so large, and the brightness of the red glow, and the somewhat slight tear dropped shape of the eyes, and the peering out and slinking back...meant it wasn’t an owl. Even when we put the fire out, and turned the lights out the eyes still glowed very bright...not your normal eye shine. \n\nThen I looked into the strange stuff. Bigfoot reports where people had seen glowing red eyes, but I saw no body. Mothman...a likely candidate. The Jersey Devil, possibly. But I remembered my friend said “they” would reveal themselves in their own time, and I had just told the story before this happened. I believe what we saw was a dark entity of some sort, a demon if you will.\n\nTake it or leave it, but everything I just wrote happened to me and my best friend. He still asks me to tell the story at parties when we are drinking with friends lol. We do plan On going back to that exact spot in the future, better prepared.\n\nAnyone here ever experience anything similar? Please comment and tell me what you think I saw. Or share your story.",

She was my best friend, my twin soul and after 13 years of losing her, the pain is still fresh.She was killed when her drunk roomate crashed her motorbike with my cousin riding the pillion. My cousin never wanted to go out that night her roommate dragged her out and my cousin paid the ultimate price.\n\nI often wondered if she has moved on, of she is not around us anymore.Cause initially after she died I could feel her presence around me. I saw her in my dreams, smelled her perfume and even heard her.\n\nTwo months after she died I went to her home for the first time and I couldn't sleep at night. We always slept together talking and singing late till night. I broke down and asked her for a sign. I then heard her voice, it sounded like it came from the radio but it was her. \n\n\n I always felt her presence and for some reason I felt like she was trying to comfort me but I was freaking out so she was keeping her distance. It was heavy and heady. We are hindus and we have many rituals involved in helping a departed soul cross over. After her rituals were done I could no longer feel her.\n\n So I thought she was gone. But something happened today, after nearly 13 years that has me questioning things. As always her death anniversary sucks for me. I was getting ready to go to work and I was trying to get outfits. I couldn't find a decent shirt. I was already mopey and suddenly thought to  'Give me a sign she is around ' and suddenly i found an old blouse of hers that I still have. This blouse had been missing for a year. I thought my mom had thrown it away but finding it out of no where was weird considering that my mom had rearranged my wardrobe. It was under a few clothes that i was sure wasn't there before.\n\nI started crying when i found it, it was such a soothing feeling. My question is did she really respond or was it a coincidence?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy grandmother (who raised me) recently passed away. More like a mother to me, she took me off my drug-addict parents when I was young, becoming a single mother again when she was in her 60s. She did an incredible job, and life for me would have turned out very differently for had it not been for her intervention. Needless to say, we had an extremely close relationship.\n\nAs I grew into a successful adult (I'm 28 now), roles reversed, as she became older and sicker (a diabetic who ended up requiring multiple amputations, dialysis and finally developed the early symptoms of what was speculated to be vascular dementia). She passed away from sepsis after a 6-week long battle in hospital. I was lucky enough to be in a position that I could take that time off work, and was at the hospital with her every day until she passed.\n\nHer hospitalisation, however, was long and protracted, and quite traumatic. As with many older patients with sepsis/blood poisoning, she developed delirium, which honestly was indistinguishable from psychosis at times. This included seeing what she believed to be dead people in her room   \nand moving about in the corridor, and her calling me at night screaming about some of her hallucinations. \n\nI would rush to the hospital, and once there, she would calm down. But even in her more sober-minded, she would recall these incidents in a level of detail I wouldn't expect, and fully believed what she was seeing was real. As a non-believer, I rushed to attribute these to her delirium but I would like to hear your thoughts?\n\nBeing her next of kin I was in charge of arrangements when she passed. And it was the day she passed that my partner and I had an experience that would lead us to doubt our previously held beliefs about the afterlife. \n\nWe were staying in her house, looking after her dog and two cats, who she adored. She passed away around 4:15am, and I received a call from the hospital at about 4:30am. About ten minutes before the phone rang, my partner woke up to her dog, sleeping on the end of our bed, moving in a way like she was being petted. She also sensed a strange feeling in the house, almost like electricity in the air. This lead her to wonder whether my grandmother had passed, and moments later, the phone rang, waking me up and informing me she had died.\n\nAs I woke up, I too felt a certain strangeness in the air. Like the calm after a storm with static still hanging in the air. After taking the call, I went into her bedroom to see one of her cats, looking up, meowing in a really strange rhythm at nothing. Soon after an object of meaning to her was inexplicably knocked off a table in her living room.\n\nIt really felt like her spirit rushed through the house, and then left. I haven't felt her presence since, and don't know what to believe. \n\nAny similar experiences or explanations?",

No light bulbs are burnt out, no motion lights or hidden cameras (I checked just to be sure) I have absolutely no explanation for this. It did scare me a bit, mostly because it was unexpected and something I can’t easily explain away.

All the sudden my dog starts growling at the door in the shadow walks up and I stand up and I swing the door open and nothing is there and then she runs under the bed. Nothing has happened ever since that day. My mom’s been fine since then, there are things that happen here and there but she still sometimes falls asleep while driving which is why me and my sister drives now that’s the only thing that’s permanently affected her from this. Let me know if you want the whole story 😜",

(there is a TL;DR below the text, if the text seems unreadable)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk a little bit more context\n\nI live in a house that, i among a few people rent. We're not supper close but we do all get along (a total of 10 people 2 dogs and 3-4 cats) it is a two story house. normally no one's in the kitchen/outside/living room around midnight. and if so the kitchen light will be on. (It's pretty active during the day with one or two people almost always in the living room, i do not get this feeling then )\n\nno one's a night owl except me and another person who also has a funky work schedule. \n\nI sometimes go downstairs for an occasional snack (around midnight-ish). once in a while, i feel like im being watched (Like being watched is both inside and outside looking in) (we do have porchlights that are normally on and work pretty well. the backyard has a high fence non see through fence with neighbors all around). I don't feel safe until I get in my room and/or upstairs. Please note it's not a simple \"oh someone's looking at me\" that i get from my roommates. It's a neck hair curling, feel pressure in the middle of my spine type where you want to leave the room immediately. \n\nalso please note the house is in a more expensive area of houses, but this \"area\" is pretty secluded. while not too far from a town there is no public transportation and it will take about a quarter to a half a day walking. AKA no one's going to walk it unless necessary.\n\nI have had paranormal encounters before this house, but nothing notable in this house. Am i just paranoid? because it doesn't happen ALL the time. Just once in a blue moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nI feel watched at night while in the kitchen\n\nIt is a Hair curling, bad gut, pressure on your spine that makes you want to leave the room asap.\n\nthis scenario only happens when no one is down there and only at late night sometimes.\n\nthis feeling often does hold and/or increase if I go outside (no one/animal will be out there and a relatively good porchlight tends to be on)\n\nIt feels like I'm being watched by both the inside of the house and outside of the house looking in from the backyard\n\nNothing happens except that and when I'm going upstairs to escape such feeling, i sometimes think i see a person at/or near the bottom of the stairs. normally in the corner of my eye. (they disappear when I look directly. normally it looks like a shadow and/or exceptionably darkness on the lower walls looking like it's trying to reach me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext:\n\nI share a house with a lot of people and pets (10 people, 3-4 cats, 2 dogs )\n\nIt is a two story home, in a suburban area (nice in general, very quiet) but located far away from town that it is highly unlikely people will walk to it.\n\nIt is surrounded by houses on the sides and back (High, non-see through fence)\n\nIt is located the desert \n\nLight is on if anybody is down in the kitchen (this scenario only happens when no one is down there and only at night sometimes)\n\nthe household is normally active until later in evening then everyone will tend to be in their respective rooms (10:30 pm and later)\n\nthe house is not haunted (not that I know of, or was told) but I have experience paranormal things over my entire lifetime and some experiences were shared with others experiencing it at the same time as I did. \n\nI do suffer from a form of undiagnosed depression my whole life but it has gotten better. I have been developing panic attacks from ptsd (not often), I think this may be part of the reason, but i don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLASTLY: Can i just chalk it up to being paranormal or just paranoid? (note : I am not in danger as everyone who resides here takes safety seriously and most are armed.)",

        "text": "I wanna preface this by saying I am a skeptic and have been my whole life, but this event stands out as an unexplained experience that has terrified me for a long time. This is a long story so bear with me, please.\n\nIn between my freshman and sophomore year, I moved to a new house. We had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the master bedroom belonged to the couple who lived there prior, and the other two belonged to their son and a guest if needed. I got the son's old room. \n\nThe reason the house was for sale was because the man and his son were looking for a smaller house as the mother had passed away. From what? I have no idea. \n\nThe first couple days to weeks in the house I had awful headaches. I didn't really think much of that at the time, since migraines are a common thing in my family, especially my mother and myself. The following events took place over the next two to three years, and got worse over time. \n\nSome days, I'd come home and take a nap after class. For about one or two hours usually. On more than a few occasions, I had horrible nightmares, and then one day they stopped and I would be standing in my room, watching myself sleep. My room was exactly how everything was laid out normally. For example if I put my backpack at the entryway of my door, it was there and I could physically see it. I was just watching myself sleep, which was already eerie. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I'd see *something* moving up my bed and feel pressure on my neck. I could feel my chest holding the weight of something heavy. I could feel everything and I remember vividly being slapped our punched by something. On more than one occasion, I had marks on my neck or arms from where I was choked or scratched or punched. \n\nI experienced this until I moved out of the house when I was 21. \n\nMy only explanation, if it is paranormal, is that the entity I was dealing with was the mother, who passed away in the home years prior to my arrival. Perhaps it was because I was in the son's room and I was unwelcome. No one else, to my knowledge, had any wild experiences other than the occasional open cabinet or door being ajar.",

        "text": "This may not be exceptionally scary to adults, but to fifth-grade me, years ago, this encounter was terrifying. If the tag is wrong, I apologize. \n\nI’ll include some background for context because that’s usually my favorite part of stories. Anyways. \n\nMy hometown grew in population steadily since its founding in 1889. It’s a city wedged between a college town and the state capitol, with a major interstate cutting through, so naturally the city has grown busy. With cheap living, beautiful parks, great schools, it’s an ideal place to settle down and have children or enjoy a quiet life if that’s what you desire. \n\nThe high school was overgrown before I was l born in ‘99, so they built an even bigger high school in ‘68, followed by two more high schools on the west and south sides of town in ‘88 and ‘08. The old high school still stands and people or businesses can rent out the classrooms. I’ve seen restaurants, office spaces, and studios come and go there. \n\nOne business was an artist who held her studio and classes out of several of the rooms.\n\nAfter exhibiting interest in art, I told my mom I wanted to take some classes and she enrolled me at a studio there. I’d never been to the building before, it was old but I liked it. My art teacher delighted me. I took some private classes there in fifth grade. I enjoyed my teacher a lot and we had great conversations. I was one of her older students and we often chatted about life and outside interests while we both worked. \n\nI’ll call my art teacher Mindy to protect identities. \n\nI trusted Mindy. We would talk about anything and everything. I must have asked if she believed in the paranormal, a childhood interest of mine, because it wasn’t long after she told me the school housed spirit visitors. We spoke of that frequently. \n\nOne day, I noticed a to-do list she had posted to one of the walls. I was snoopy and read it. One of the lines said “Clean out black hole.” I asked her what the Black Hole was and she said it was a room down the hall that was used for storage. I asked if we could go see it because I thought it was super funny that they called it the “Black Hole.” She agreed and took me down the hall. \n\nThe school was old and creaky but never unfriendly. This room was different though. \n\nIt was pitch dark. She said they had no idea why there wasn’t electricity in that room and that no matter what they tried, they couldn’t get the lights on. Just in that room though.\n\nLike any storage room, it was cluttered. Thrown about were desks, chairs, bookshelves, even old sinks and toilets were shoved inside. There was no light from the outside or from any bulbs in the room. Some of the windows were painted black. On other windows, the glass was broken out and was replaced with wooden boards. The room was freaky. \n\nMindy told me a bit about the room. She told me the Black Hole housed a spirit of an older gentleman, one who wasn’t necessarily a happy guy. She spoke to him and told him to leave us alone, and we’d be out of there soon. In some words, the vibe was off in that room. \n\nLike I said before, the paranormal was a point of interest in my childhood for a long time. \n\nFast forward to one of my last classes there. I’m painting in illustrations on a wall Mindy had sketched out already. Mindy left me on my own that night, she was in a meeting about the space in the room right next to where I was, and she wasn’t far. She told me to grab her if I needed her. I wasn’t necessarily planning on needing her. \n\nSo I’m painting. Not really thinking about much just making sure my colors don’t blend together. It was coming along nicely. I was painting and deep in my own thoughts. \n\nI see something down the hall in the corner of my eye. Looked like a man, but it was gray and fuzzy. Almost like TV static in human form. I looked. Nothing there. What scared me though was that he was standing in front of the Black Hole. I knew instantly who it was and my first thought was “He is mean.” I got chills, but it was okay. I tried to ignore it, and went back to my work. I was used to seeing things out of the corner of my eye, anyways. Could have been anything. \n\nNot even five minutes later it happens again. Exact same figure. I looked through my peripherals for a minute before I finally looked at it head on. Same figure. Gone again. \n\n It is not uncommon for me to see things in the corner of my eye and when I look it’s not there anymore. But it never happens twice. Never twice with the same being. I was terrified. I’d never encountered anything like this before and it could have been a reflection, a shadow, anything, but I can’t misinterpret how my body reacted. Sheer fear. Flight or fight activated. I went and told my teacher and she seemed upset. Not at me, but just… I don’t know. She told him to go away and stop bothering me. She knew what it was and what was bothering me. \n\nMy body had chills and the second time I saw it, I went completely cold. Like adrenaline and fear and everything mixed together was pumping through me. \nTo this day, I know what I saw. I saw that man. I know I did. He may have been just watching. He probably was. I just don’t know. \n\nYears later she moved her studio due to safety reasons. My mom told me that. I don’t know if it was just an old building and dangerous in that way, or if it was more. \n\nAnyways, I’d love your take. Sorry if it’s not that scary.",

My first encounter was two  Ago on December 15 at 2:45am I was as usual staying up early in the morning waiting for my Irish friends to get online so we chat right when chatting I heard noise coming from our dining table I looked up and saw two of our dining chairs shaking/wobbling for about 3min before it stopped and never heard it again no experience the chairs shaking again. Also I did check my surroundings to check if anything was shaking too but nothing . My second encounter was around 1 pm when I was alone in the house I had left my room to use the restroom and right when I was finishing up I heard human footsteps walking into my parents bedroom to the door restroom door and stopping and then going around to other side entering my room and stopping at the other door to the restroom I got up quickly from the toilet to see who it was and saw nobody. Third encounter was 3 months ago early in the at 1:45am I was on sofa again with the lights in the living room off  chilling and talking to my friends online when I heard footsteps again by the dining table and a minute later my parents room-slam open making this loud bang that woke up my mom , she got up from her bed asking me if I saw that and I said yes and then  telling her about hearing footsteps heading to her door before her door bust opened. Honestly we couldn’t sleep that night after that experience.\n\nSorry about my writing , English isn’t my first language",

        "text": "I'd like to preface with 2 things. 1. This'll probably get taken down, but I have no idea where else to post something like this, 2. Before the event I had never watched Smile. All I knew of it was that it was a Demon that smiled\n\nAnyway\n\nI tend to have dreams that feel very real. Mostly taking place in my house, everything in the right place where it's meant to be, interacting with things correctly. The only weird and dream thing is randomly getting to places of the house, but when asleep you don't realise that until you wake up and go...yeah I wouldn't have got from this room to that room that quickly. Point is my dreams recently have all felt so real, and always scary, and always taking part in my house. (I'd also like to say I've had a few experiences all throughout my life in this house of some weird paranormal shit, which I've made a post about before ages ago)\n\nI only remember 2 recent dreams that I will try to recall\n\nThe first, I work up in my room. It felt normal. I got out of bed climbed down the bed ladder (I'm 17 and have a single bunk bed (using the underside for storage)) put on my dressing gown, and walked out to the bathroom. Now, when I'm awake and it's dark, I always check behind the shower curtain. Cos you never know. So I do that, and standing there is a slender arching figure. I'm shocked and scared and go to move back but he launched at me, smacking me against the bathroom window. It has no features and yet I can feel it looking into my eyes. Then I properly wake up into actual real life. Scared senseless, sweating.\n\nThe second more recent (and why I mention smile) was again in my house as a dream. I do the same. Wake up, bathroom, check behind curtain, go to go to the toilet and look in the mirror. At this moment my eyes lock with the mirror of myself. It begins to stare at me and it's...around the eye bits. Like where you would get sleep bags, begin to go a dark grey colour, as if the life was being pulled from them. Then a voice (I don't remember exactly what was said or when it was siad but the 2 things I know we're said at some point we're) 'You will die in 20' 'I am Dovka (or Dokva? I'm not sure)'. I ran out the bathroom. I heard a little girl cry, then laugh. I walk to my parent downstairs. They look at me. Black eyes. Deep sockets. I wake up, for real this time, again in sweats\n\nThe third time, I was awake, this was a couple of months ago, and I just remember while writing these others. I remember waking up, presumably from a dream. Covered in sweat. I look around as I do, and next to my bed I see a dark foreboding head, no features. I scream and kick out. It disappears. My parents say they never heard anything despite being right next to my room and being able to wake up to the slightest sound\n\nWhat's your guys take on all of this? I'll reference my other post in the comments if I find it too",

        "text": "I hope the guy that told me his experience in this town is ok with me sharing his sorry, but a guy that I had a 1st date with told me a very peculiar happening when he used to live in this small town in Canada. \n\nHe was renting a house from a landlord, and the landlord had told him the house is in great condition for it being built a while back when the town first became an area of populace for settlers. The landlord had said the house was all his to accommodate but his only rule was to not go downstairs b/c the stairs were in no shape to be going down. So sure enough he said he would abide by his request. Well you know how that goes with curiosity getting the best of people he eventually has the urge to push the washer and dryer out of the way of the basement door so he can explore the prohibited terrain. \n\nThe first thing he notices that is odd once he opens the door and goes down the stairs is that his flashlight starts flickering. He says that is very strange for his flashlight to be acting like this b/c he knows for a fact that it was a fully charged battery. He  goes on to explain that he is a survivalist and always makes sure that he has a topped up battery at all times. Once he gets down to the bottom of the stairs he notices very old vintage toys, like a rocking horse, which I suppose isnt out of the usual, so he continues on. He notices his dog frantically running around the room in circles. He goes on to say that as he is exploring the room he notices it opens up into another room. Before he goes into the second room he explains that he flashed his light into the room and described a void, a black mass in the middle of the room. \n\nI am literally getting chills and its hard to type this as I recollect the story he told me. No lie.\n\nThis is not even the most fucked part of this event.\n\nHe enters the room with the dense void in the center of the room, as this void doesnt scare him enough to not abort the mission and go up the stairs already, what he notices when he enters the room is that in the middle where the void was it was much deeper like a swimming pool, say 10x15ft in dimension and that there was canals at every corner and in the middle of every side of this pool. In the middle of the pool is a chair and very dark staining on the floor around the chair...\n\nHe continues exploring around this room and notices on one of the walls there is boards nailed to the wall covering up an entry way underground..\n\nBy then he is already freaked out by the blood-letting pool so he goes upstairs.\n\nAfter that he told me that there was strange apparitions around the house. He said that him and his now ex-girlfriend were getting ready for bed, relaxing in bed. He had explained that they kept the bathroom door closed to keep the dog out at night but he noticed through the key hole of the door since it was across the bed from where they were sitting that the light was on. But the creepy part was that there was a shadow moving back and forth across the bathroom that you could see light then shadow light then shadow light then shadow and so on...\n\nHe started doing some investigating about the place and that the town was hugely religious, Methodist more specifically. The churches around there had a common plant that was always around on the property, a white lilac that is symbolic of death. Hickson Ontario is known for their walking trails around there so he said he explored the area around his house and said that he found unmarked graves there as well. He had shown his mom pictures of the area and she said that there was orbs and high spiritual energy there. He did some more looking around and found some pictures of children at the churches and noticed they had very uncanny smiles that were very unsettling..\n\nDoes anyone know anything abnormal about this place? I tried doing my own research but I have a sneaking suspicion that you need to do a deep dive to find anything remotely of what I am looking for. All the searches that came up for me kept repeating in farther pages that I looked up on google. Cancel culture is in full flex right now...",

        "text": "There was a day where i had asked to go over my mother's friend's house. I was pretty close to her children even though they were older than me. That exact same day, the apartment we were staying in caught on fire. the area near the front door had been engulfed in flames, as my mother says she had to run to the balcony. When she did, there was a man telling her to jump and that he'd catch her. She was terrified of doing such a thing, but obviously more terrified of burning to death or suffocating. My mother would go on to jump and the man would catch her and proceed to ask if she was okay- to which she would reply that she was, thanking him as well.\n\nMy mother tells me that there were a few people outside already looking at the fire. Strangely enough, none of them asked about the man that saved her, or even noticed him do so. She would strike up a conversation with one of the onlookers for what she tells me was literally about 5 seconds, bringing up the guy that saved her and turning her head back to look at him. Except, he was gone. None of the observers even claim to have seen anyone there with my mother, and there's no way he was able to run or walk away without anyone seeing him. He just vanished. To this day, my mother and i believe he was a guardian angel that saved her, as the circumstances around this event just seem very strange. I like to tell myself that it could have been some random guy that just walked off, but then i'm confronted with an obvious question: how didn't anyone else see him? \n\nAnyway, just a little story.",

I've been living in a new property for about 6 months and all kinds of things have happened from multiple items disappearing and then returning a few weeks later in obvious hard to miss places (i.e. hallway paths etc), hearing footsteps and sometimes voices in other rooms, smells of urine and burning in rooms, from objects like an ear ring falling out of thin air into my girlfriends hands, and most recently a book flying off the shelf after having said I don't like living in this house and can't wait to move. The most bizzare thing is that, all this has happened when my girlfriend has been present in the house, and not when I'm on my own. Why do you think this is?\n\nThe only thing I notice when I'm on my own is I get this emotional feeling of short tempered/aggression that comes in a wave from time to time, and is usually followed with a tingling sensation and as soon as I leave the property I feel a whole lot better and relaxed. There is a feeling that I am not alone. Most of the activity has occurred in my bedroom where I sleep, and a small amount of instances in the hallway.\n\nShould I be careful as to what I say or think? I did some research online and it seems to be poltergeist activity but I have no idea as to what I should do or react in situations like this.",

        "text": "So me and my husband moved into a gently haunted house. 🫤\n\nTwice now he’s seen me in his periphery, except I’m either in a completely different room or right next to him. The first time I was in the living room, downstairs, when he saw “me” go past him in the bathroom. The second time I was upstairs when he saw “me” go into the kitchen. \n\nThese are startling situations!! Whenever he gets quiet and says my name while not moving, I get scared and start shivering. I asked him to describe what he sees when he “sees me”, because I haven’t seen them and obviously I’m thinking the worst. He says it’s just a me-sized shape moving in the dark, but he’s not afraid.\n\nIncidentally, we’re also renovating the basement. We have to rip up/out the paneling and carpet because there’s a serious mold problem down there, and at one point there was some sewage. It’s gross. I know that can rustle up some activity, and there’s a small stream flowing next to the house and a sizable duck pond across the street. The house itself was built in the mid 50’s, and my uncle has owned it since the early 90’s, up until last June when my grandmother passed, then he took her house and we got this one. When my husband said he was seeing me-sized shapes, I thought maybe it was my grandmother, since we were similar height, but it turns out my uncle has seen them too?? He says it’s the previous owners, Mr  and Mrs Hopkins, and they didn’t bother him, they just walk around sometimes.\n\nI’m familiar with residual hauntings, but I’ve never experienced one. 99% of my ghostly knowledge comes from the likes of Zak Baggans and Grant Wilson. They tell me that residuals are largely harmless, won’t interact with me, and are more like “reruns”. I found some snips from a ghost hunting for dummies kind of thing (written by Zak apparently) that gave all kinds of possible triggers, from barometric pressure to the water content of bricks (???) and specifically said that they aren’t really even ghosts, more like images, and if I try to interact with them, they’ll just disappear.\n\nSo do I keep myself from being startled by thinking of them as like… just big moths that got inside?? Just confused guys who can’t hurt me but are nevertheless jarring to find when I’m not expecting to see them?",

He felt like he was going to die, couldn't breathe, heart was racing and he seen something short and old, facing the corner, in a black hood standing in the corner of the bedroom. He said it turned and lunged at him and he seen a bright flash of light. That's when he woke up with a terrifying scream sound that scared the crap out of me. \n\nI knew he had seen the hat man a few times before. Since this encounter, with what seems like the old hag, he has come out and said that he sees things at night more often then he has told me about. He has also heard footsteps and things moving around as if someone is in his house. This one was different though. He said when he seen the hat man he felt calm and he never remembered feeling paralyzed. He says it's possible he was but he felt calm and not panicked and like he was going to die. A few days after this, I got up and left for work and he said he thought he heard me next to him in the bed. He said he could hear footsteps come in and breathing. He had his back turned to my side of the bed and finally got the courage to check the camera and my car was gone. \n\nHe's been so scared to sleep, that he's really not sleeping much, which isn't helping anything. He tries to take naps during the day. I just don't know what to think or what to do to help him. I have never experienced any of these things while I am there. \n\nSo I am looking for opinions on if this is a sleep paralysis type ordeal, or if it's hallucinations possibly due to him having bipolar, or is this paranormal? Also any advice anyone can give me on how to help him would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I (29F) am in the final stages of purchasing an old farmhouse. It's a humble 100 year old house on 157 acres in rural, northern Canada. It's a 3 hour move from my current place, which I had to unfortunately leave due to a physically absuive relationship. This area stood out to me as it's relatively close to where my grandparents lived and farmed. It's perfect, and everything I want in a home.\n\nYesterday, I had a tour of the property with the current owner who has lived there for the last 10 years. The house has 2 doors, and when I asked why he doesn't use the side door (that has a large mudroom) he casually mentioned his daughter (early 20s) is scared of the basement. Jokingly, I said \"what, is there ghosts?\" To which he replied, \"yes actually there is\". My next question was \"are they good or bad\" and he reassured me they were \"good\". \n\nHe then told me he sees a man downstairs sometimes, and occasionally sees him outside walking towards the shop. There's a woman that spends her time in the kitchen when he sees her. He has never seen the children, but he often hears them playing outside. I asked if there was any family tradegy that occured on the property and he said that the only story he knows of was the original owners who built and homesteaded there lost a child at a young age, and because it was winter they had to store him in the cistern in the basement for the winter until the ground thawed. \n\nI didn't have any negative feelings in the house. I did feel a sense of comfort, but I've also had bad energies in a house previously so I can't lie and say I'm not a little nervous. \n\nA good friend of mine is clairvoyant and I brought it up to her. She assured me that they are not harmful spirits and they have attachments to their first home.  She said she sensed they liked me. She went on to say that the current owner advised me of them out of respect for them (there are no disclosure laws of haunted houses where I live) and as long as I live with respect to them everything will be good.\n\nIs there anything I should be mindful of when moving in? Anything I should do? Any kind of smudge or anything I should place in the home? I've heard not to put a mirror facing my bed, and I'm just wondering if there is anything else I can do. I don't want to push them away, but I don't want to open myself to anything negative either. \n\nThis really is a first for me purposely moving into a place with known entities living in it. I will also say, I live alone for the majority. I have dogs and cats, and a new boyfriend who seems to be a little uneasy about this news. However, my mantra the last few months has been, \"I am capable of anything. I got out of an abusive relationship that should have killed me and here I am\"... I have been living my life with a newfound empowerment so I feel confident I can get through whatever life throws at me.",

I’m looking for someone who is spiritually evolved, and knows things about Christianity.\n\nFrom 2021 spring until fall of 2022, I was inpatient. The reasons for coercion were not acceptable, because I was delusional and not a danger to myself. However, I said yes to the question to suicidal ideation and that gave them legal means to held me. I was injected with antipsychotics.\n\nI was released, but I was very suicidal and recommitted in the summer. \n\nNearing the fall, I noticed Mandela effects. I grew suspicious. One day, it was a very dreamlike experience, and peoples irises were spinning. I didn’t know what was happening to me. The next day, I thought I was in the underworld. I went to church outside my freedoms. There, there were 3 people. 2 women and one man. The man was creepy.\n\nWhen I returned, other inpatients were crying and upset. I suspect they knew me, and they knew something I don’t. \n\nI was committed in the closed ward. There were 2 other patients. They were the same age, students. One was an artist and one was a mathematician. They knew me. But they wouldn’t talk. They would just say vague things to me.\n\nAnyway, this went on and on and on. I saw the court two times. I could have appealed because their reasoning was insufficient, but I didn’t. I was depressed and saw euthanasia as the best option.\n\nNext up, they transferred me to some bunker. There I was hooked up to an IV. I don’t know what they did, but I only saw blackness and heard nothing. This didn’t last very long. \n\nI was transferred back to regular ward. They said I was “catatonic”. I wasn’t.\n\nAnyway, a few months later, they said I was catatonic again and transferred me  to a medical psychiatric unit. I remember the drive to the hospital, this man with yellowish eyes just typed on his laptop. I remember arriving at the hospital, again it seemed very dreamlike. It looked industrial where he parked, and we went indoors somewhere. I remember walking past people eating somewhere at the restaurant. I remember walking down the stairs, but my memory goes blank after that. \n\nI spend there 3 months. They said I was catatonic, I wasn’t.\n\nEventuall after all this, I was released. I feel stupid for not resisting smarter, I would walk away but the police would catch me.\n\nAnyone has any idea what the f* happened here? I left a lot of perhaps important details out but if anyone could possibly know more dm is open. The paranormal stuff includes people knowing my childhood nightmares and thoughts by detail.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am looking for advice or books on Paranormal occurrences of objects/items coming into existence and appearing.\n\nIt is based form several experiences I have had throughout the years and wanted to know if there are any collective studies or recordings of it happening elsewhere. Any advice or help on this would be gratefully appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read this if you do.\n\nMy nan passed away in 2013 she lived with us for her final days and have always felt her presence stayed with my parents house. I am now 35 living with my partner in our own place but the paranormal experience is one of comfort rather than fear so I know it probably is not as exciting but one that has occurred not just to me but my two brothers and Mum.\n\nThe situation that occurs is when our family suffers a great trauma or a moment of self doubt. Long story short my life has not been a healthy one I had Leukaemia when I was 10 had was lucky to have a stem cell transplant but now unfortunately I am currently for the past 2 years have been going through treatment for Bowel cancer. \n\nThe event in question is in these moments of stress and worry, a calming sensation seems to come over us when self reflecting. This is followed by a single white feather floating down from the sky this started only after my Nan passed away and first occurred to my mum the day after she passed. This has now happened at least 20 times to myself and my family.\n\nThis has occurred at the house but also when out and about. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar or is this a regular recorded occurrence in the paranormal any books or papers about this would be appreciated . I understand that reading this I am just finding signs in nothing but always seems to happen in moments of stress and self reflection.",

Not sure if anyone has experience of familiarity with this.\n\n1) Had a dream where I saw a spirit. I experienced a sense of sleep paralysis and then in fear I went to scream but instead of a scream my vocals sang in a high pitched vibrato (almost like a ghost or wailing spirit).\n\n2) Most recently had a dream where I was sensing darkness / disturbances / annoyances. In meditation I’ve heard to imagine yourself as a light and pushing out your energy. I tried this with all my being (I half lucid dream very often) and I was able to brighten the room a bit (not sure if it was a astral state deal in my home or not). Anyway, I’ve done this before but this particular time the energy dispersion was so powerful I actually could not stop the pulsing of energy and while in my dream I could hear my vocal chords “sing” at a high pitch every interval of the energy pulse. \n\nI refrain from thinking this would be any sort of possession but it peaks my curiosity and so I’m reaching out to the community to get an outside take.",

I didn't freak out much since ive always been the type to rationalize everything and at the time I thought maybe I was just sleepy and imagining things (I wasn't groggy.. not even sleepy). Rubbed my eyes but it was still there. After what seemed like hours of me staring at this thing it turned its head to look at me. My heart dropped and I was paralyzed in fear (I had stood up in bed after initially seeing it ) \n\nFew minutes of staring at this thing that was now staring me down too it walked forward. At this point there was no logical explanation, no rationalizing it. I wanted to scream like a little girl and I did open my mouth but nothing came out. \n\nIt walked just before going behind a desk I had and kneeling down to the point it was completely out of view. After what seemed like an eternity of me waiting for whats next I got the balls to stand up and check behind the desk. No one was there. \n\nI wasnt imagining it. It wasnt even sleep paralysis, I had moved so many times during this, eyes wide open, full thoughts and thinking. This thing was literally interacting with me. I can't think of one instance where I was genuinely scared shitless before this, its like this thing could sense the fear in me. \n\nIt's been years and I swear to this day every time I'm in bed with the lights off and roll over theres still this part of me that begs \"please don't be there, please don't be there\" or turning off the lights at night and walking around ill avoid looking around fearing ill see that thing again. Never have thought and I hope I never do\n\nI just cant get over how this thing seemed to toy around with me, taunting me. I'm just trying to figure out of this thing is real looking from my bed, I rub my eyes. Still there, I stand up in my bed, it's still there. I KEEP STARING at this shadow for minutes trying to figure out what it is, how or what is casting this perfectly shaped silhouette of a man, getting more terrified by the second after exhausting every possible explanation in my head and then it suddenly turns its fucking head to look at me?? You cant tell me that thing wasnt taunting me. Its like it sensed the fear and was saying/ confirming \"yes I'm real\" Then after minutesof staring each other walking and squatting down? \n\nCall me crazy but that thing was no \"ghost\" it sucked the fear out of me,  interacted with me, moved, and made an attempt to hide. It knew what I was thinking.",

        "text": "     Sorry if this is hard to understand. I am writing this at 2:30 in the morning and can't sleep. Anyway, my family has always had stories of the paranormal. The first thing I ever heard of was a story from my mom. When she was younger, her and her sister were sitting on a bed in an upstairs bedroom. My grandma and their old dog were out at the time so it was just my grandpa, mom, and aunt. So, they were sitting on the bed talking when it started violently shaking. Nothing else in the room was moving. Needless to say, they were scared so they ran downstairs to my grandpa to explain what happened.\n\n      At first he brushed them off and told them to go back to playing. Then, upstairs there were loud footsteps across the hallway. That's when my grandpa offered to go get ice cream. About a decade later I was born and a year after that my brother. After a couple years, we moved back into my grandparents house due to some things I won't get into. At this point I was around 3-4 and me and my brother were sharing a room which also just so happened to be the same room as the first story. I heard about this one from my mom as well.\n\n      One morning around 1 am my mom walked into our room to tell us to go to bed. I guess she heard me telling my brother to go to sleep and stop playing with our toys because he was being loud. She turned on the light to see a mess of toys on the ground but my brother was asleep. About 3 years later my mom got back into dating and we moved into an apartment with her boyfriend after about a year or two. He is now my legal dad but that isn't relevant. The apartment on the other hand is. Around first or second grade my grandma on my dad's side died. This hit me really hard and I was struggling with it. We lived on the same road of the cemetery where she was buried and a creek led from the cemetery to the apartment. Growing up I always heard spirits travel through water.\n\n        Eventually I decided to just ask for guidance or to somehow see her again. About a week or two later, I woke up in a cold sweat and my covers were half off. I rubbed my eyes and tried looking around. I was on the top bunk of a bunk bed and the door was at the foot of my bed. As I looked around, I noticed something at the foot of my bed. It looked like my grandma was in the corner of the ceiling above my door. I quickly grabbed my covers and threw them over my head. I fell back asleep after a while. That morning I asked my dad about it. From what he said, earlier that month he woke up to my mom sitting upright in bed one morning pointing to above their door and staring. My dad started asking her what was wrong but she didn't say anything. About 5 minutes later she snapped out of it and said she just saw my grandma. That master bedroom was creepy too. There was one story I heard where my mom and dad were watching a movie in the living room while me and my brother were out. My dad noticed my mom was looking down the hallway a lot so he looked. When he looked he saw a freaking foot disappear back into their room.\n\n         Around third grade we moved to a house owned by my dad's boss. It was the first night there and I had set my room how I wanted it. I decided to get on my tablet and play some games while sitting in a beanbag chair. I felt like I was being watched so I looked up and saw a shadow figure run across my door. I explained it to my dad again and he told me it was the house settling which worked as an explanation in my 10 year old mind. Three days later, my dad went back to the house for his lunch break. I should've said this earlier but his job was a walking distance from the house. He was eating his lunch when he heard loud footsteps in the hallway. He searched the house and found nothing. The next day my mom was home alone. She was carrying a hamper to the laundry room when she saw a shadow figure run from the kitchen to the laundry room.\n\n         For a while everything settled down. There were still small things like my bedroom door handle randomly twisting and my door popping open while I was the only one home and stuff like that but about a year after we moved in we were watching a movie. My dad was in the master bedroom and decided to go into my brother's room to look for something. My brother was and still is a big fan of motorcycles and he had a large pull back motorcycle that was kept in a plastic container. When my dad opened the door he saw that motorcycle rolling across the floor with the case open next to it and when my dad looked at the motorcycle it fell over.\n\n        Again stuff settled down for years until middle school. My sister was born a year before and we bought her this walker thing to help her learn to walk. One day we were all sitting in the living room. My sister's walker and high chair were sitting in the middle of the room. We were watching a show when out of nowhere her walker started moving and somehow the front lifted and ended up getting stuck under the high chair. We were all stunned and had no idea what to think. Around the same time we put in motion sensor light switches for the hallway. It was mainly so it was easier to move with my sister. We started having problems with those too. It still happens occasionally where there will be nothing in the hallway and the hallway lights will turn on. Currently all I deal with is stuff in my room falling over and I pretty much just say stop and then I'm good. Well those are my stories of paranormal experiences my family has had over the years. I know it is a long read but it is a lot of stories.",

        "text": "Hi, new here. I don't really believe in this sort of stuff, but honestly I just couldn't explain this experience of mine. I thought maybe someone on here might know... Anyways, here goes.\n\nThis happened about two or three weeks ago, at around 2:30 to 3:00 in the morning. For context, I'm a college grad in China, going to a small private school. I have a job at the foreign faculty residential building on the campus because they said if I work the night shifts, they'd let me live in one of the rooms, since a lot of the rooms are empty. My girlfriend works the same job, and also lives in the building. This night I was sitting out in the lobby (which is this giant 50 by 20 glass room), waiting for my girlfriend to come out so we could have a drink (we do this regularly). I was also waiting for our three other friends who lived on campus but didn't work at the foreign faculty building to arrive. I was the first one down, already had drank a little bit, as per usual. Everything was pretty normal, until around 2:50, I think.\n\nI heard my girlfriend's voice, clear as could be (quiet, albeit), calling from the front desk (which is actually a space taken out of the wall, so from the side you can't see into it). I was sitting right on the same wall as the front desk, and I count' see if anyone was behind the counter. The lights were off, but for some reason I didn't notice this. I got up and walked halfway across the room towards the front desk area before I stopped and thought, \"But isn't \\[girlfriend\\] in the shower?\". With this thought, I walked back a few steps and decided to call my girlfriend. At first she didn't pick up, but after a few rings she picked up her phone and said she had just got out of the shower. I told her I thought I heard her voice at the front desk, and she said she'd been in the shower for the past thirty minutes, how could she be at the front desk?\n\nOn this note, I looked back I the direction of the front desk, and then slowly walked back to the table I was sitting at. I sat down and kept my eye on the area of the front desk for about five or so minutes more, when I then heard my girlfriend's voice again, but this time louder, and coming from a complete different direction. It was coming from the elevator, which was at the end of a short hallway on the opposite side of the front desk. This time I didn't get up and waited to see if anything would come out. Nothing. Then I heard it from the front desk again, this time even louder, as if it was getting closer or something. Then from the elevator, even louder. Front desk, louder yet, and agian from the elevator. Then I heard a knock not he door behind me, and it ruined out to be my girlfriend coming into the lobby through the back garden. A few minutes alter our friends arrived. The rest of the night was normal.\n\nI honestly don't know what this was, and I don't know how to explain it at all. I'm curious though because I'm in China, and I've never heard of anyone else experiencing these things in China...\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "So recently, times have been somewhat unsettling. I’ve had my encounters, but none of which have I been concerned about. Once I head screaming in a dark forest which only I could hear, but luckily my friends believed me when I said we needed to get out of there. I’ve seen various shadow figures, heard voices, but none of them have felt threatening. But recently, times have been getting strange. I’m in a tight friend circle with my sister, her boyfriend, and me. We are all juniors and seniors in high school. 2 nights ago, my sister and her boyfriend were out driving late at night around our neighborhood. Oddly enough, lights seem to shut off in a pattern. The street lights, one by one, would cut off, following the vehicle. They claim that one home was completely dark as they passed, and the top floor just randomly turned on as they passed, flickering rapidly, and once they were a few doors down, it had stopped. Lamp after lamp, the darkness would follow them, and as the darkness followed them, their intuitive senses began to flare. About halfway home, a deer appeared in the middle of the road, and it would not move. Our area is heavily populated with deer, so this occurrence is normal, except for the fact that the deer are usually very skiddish. normally, the deer would be gone within seconds, but this one stayed. They said it looked weird, almost human, with whites in its eyes. He honked, and it stayed. So he carefully went into the opposite lane to pass it. When they finally got home, the house directly behind our backyard was completely alive. You could see directly inside it, the den, the kitchen, the living room, all of it. But all of the sudden, all of the lights just shut off at once. Our neighborhood is almost exclusively made of ranch style homes from the 60s/70s. These houses are designed with multiple breakers, and no option to cut the main power sources of the homes. You have to do it section by section. We found it very odd that the entire house just shut off. Now move forward to tonight, I am up making a late night snack in the kitchen. Our kitchen is full of windows where you can see directory into the backyard. I get a horrible intuitive sense, like i was being watched. I go to lock the back door and turn the porch light off, where i see a still deer with human like eyes, staring into my soul. This animal gives me chills, but i disregard my intuition and eat my sandwich on the couch with my dog. out of nowhere, my dog suddenly forgets i have food (which has literally never happened) and becomes intensely focused on the windows on the back door. I thought this seemed peculiar, and the feeling of discomfort grew into entirely being unsettled, because my dog started growling and barking, and even started shaking. I can’t shake the feeling that something is here, and i’ve also been having nightmares about screaming in my backyard where the deer shows up, but when i go to check it out i am killed by an unspeakably terrifying presence. the dream has come off and on for the last month, and slowly it feels like the dream is becoming a reality. Whatever is out there, it wants me to know it’s there, because the feeling i have is crippling.",

I also imagine riding her through beautiful meadows, mountains, and sometimes the clouds. The feeling is just so *real.* It's like I can almost feel her satiny smooth hide against my legs and the long grass under us brushing against my bare toes.\n\nI don't know her name and still don't have an entirely complete picture of what she looks like, though it's starting to come together more clearly. It's like an image that keeps fading into view little by little, becoming more vibrant and real the more I reflect on it.\n\nBut idk, maybe this all sounds crazy, and maybe it's just my imagination. I would really like to believe this all means something and that there really is a unicorn out there waiting for me in another universe. I would like to believe she watches over me and considers me her best friend.\n\nAnd for the record, no, I do not suffer from any mental health issues related to delusions.",

I also have one friend who confirms whenever she sleeps on the couch in our living room(main floor) she will hear footsteps on the staircase in the night. \n\nI have played 3 different ouija boards here(i have not done this in over 10 years at this point) and every time it tells me there are 7 spirits in this house. I myself occasionally hear weird sounds and get chills, specifically if i am sad.

It gives off a very \"in-between worlds\"  feel. I realize this doesn't make much sense, but it's hard to put into words the exact atmosphere. \n\nSome years ago, me and the rest of my family were staying at that house to visit my grandparents. \nIt was late summer, and I remember feeling uneasy the whole evening in a particular day. \nAt night it left me drained, so I decided to go to bed a little earlier than usual. \n\nHowever, I just couldn't sleep. No matter how tired I was, and I don't even normally have insomnia. \nWhen my sister joined me in our shared bedroom I told her about it and since she wasn't feeling sleepy either, she proposed we kept each other company by talking until sleepiness got to us. \n\nThis little silly method worked for us in the past, but it didn't that night. Because no more than 10 minutes into our chatting, we started hearing a noise outside. \n\nThis noise is not like anything I have ever heard. It sounded fairly loud, but contained enough. \nIt was scratching, mixed to growling, maybe even chewing. It was similar to a rabid animal noise, which is pretty regular, but what made it strange is that it didn't sound natural at all. It had a distinct metallic feeling to it, like it was definitely a machine/robot producing it rather than a beast like it'd seem at first glance. \nThat is why we don't think it was a wild animal, besides it being unlikely as we were in an urbanized place. \n\nThe noise went on the entire night. Sometimes it got louder, other times a little quieter, but it only stopped entirely around 6am. \nIt seems like me and my sister were the only ones who heard it, despite the noise being loud enough to be heard through all the (quite small) house. \n\nIs there a known creature/phenomenon that fits this description?\nThank you so much for reading!",

There’s a dresser right in front of my bed with a mirror, and I found myself just staring at my silhouette without really paying attention. Then I got a little creeped out at how fake it all looked, I got up and got face to face with the mirror. As I got close enough to see my face, I saw the most horrifying version of myself. \n\nNow I know the dark room and the mirror itself could’ve just created an illusion and made me look scarier, but the image is really haunting me. All I saw was darkness around my eyes and i looked like something straight out of a horror. Kind of like the Nun (conjouring). The image is making my head hurt. It all looked so fake and animated. \n\nAnyways just wanted to vent that. Is looking into the mirror at night something bad? More specifically looking at your face ? I’ve heard things like that and I’m just a little creeped out man.",

        "text": "Lately I have been thinking about some of my experiences from my late teens/early 20s and I was thinking about a visit to Cape Cod with my now ex-girlfriend.  We were out driving along Route 6 in July after being at the beach and came across a small, locally owned used book store that was in an old building set back from the road.  There was a house close by to the building, which if I remember correctly, the building looked like a barn.  Everything was painted white on the outside.  \n\n\nMy ex and I loved books, so we decided to stop in and poke around.  I was looking for anything fantasy related...my ex was looking for anything fun to read.  We breezed right in and past the old woman (in her 70s or even 80s) sitting at the counter, who politely said hello and told us to ask if we had any questions.  It was your typical used book store of the era; small, cramped, shelves and piles of books everywhere and a slight musty smell.  We poked around a bit and the woman started calling out to us:  \"That book you have there is the first in the series and that is a first edition paperback...\" or \"Don't get that one, you won't enjoy it.  The story is a bit dated now.\"  She kept talking to us, even though she wasn't in our line of sight.  She seemingly knew every book we picked up and started talking to us about it, even though she couldn't see us!  We finally settled on a couple of books and checked out.  The woman shakily took my money but couldn't find my hand to give me my change.  She then asked me \"Would you mind taking the coins out of my hand?  I'm blind and I can't find yours.\"  All the hairs on the back on my neck stood on end.  My ex picked up the books and walked out while I finished up.  \"Such a nice girl,\" the woman said to me, \"Enjoy your time with her while you can.\"  \n\n\n\"Excuse me?\"  I asked.  \"Enjoy your time with her while you can,\" the woman said to me again, \"You never know what life is going to do to you.\"  When I got in the car my girlfriend asked me to get us our of there.  \"I have goosebumps all over my body.  Please take me back to the hotel.\"  We got out of there.  As it turns out, two years later the girlfriend became my ex-girlfriend and went hard no contact.  We haven't spoken in decades.  \n\n\nThe books we bought that day?  I don't know about my ex's, but my books all disappeared within a couple of weeks.  I never found the copies I bought (A copy of the Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, if I remember correctly...I had never finished it and was going to give another go).  \n\n\nYears later I returned to the Cape and tried to find that bookstore again.  My now wife and I drove all along Route 6 and never found it.  It was possible I have the location wrong, or it was torn down.  But I can't forget the experience that the woman knew every single book one of us touched, knew all about the book we were looking at, and could tell us all about it even though she literally couldn't see us.  Maybe it is a paranormal experience, maybe not as serious as some people have, but still the weirdest one I have had.",

However, my son’s construction toy kept on going off 3 days in a row so I just knew something wasn’t right. I also kept on waking up at 3ish in the morning a few days before the paranormal activity. I have gifted friends who are mediums who told me to cast it out and that only I could help myself! It took a lot of prayers and all my might to do so but I was successful. However, I never felt right afterwards. I was afraid so I couldn’t sleep for days! I was afraid to close my eyes and have that thing wake me up again. Or I was afraid to come home from work alone at night. Most of my fear stemmed from not knowing what came to my house. I assumed it was the devil. Anyways, I just found out it wasn’t. It was a lost young soul with a complicated background. I’m so glad to feel peace again.  Im so happy that I will finally sleep well and will have control over my house again! I just wanted to share this to let everyone know this type of ish happens and that it’s real!!! I still cannot believe this happened to me!",

We cleaned it up and just kind of brushed it off. A few months later I kept finding small puddles around the house and was just really frustrated by it bc i couldn’t understand why. One night my friend was spending the night and i pulled out a mattress for her to sleep on. i walked away to get her a blanket, was away from the mattress for MAYBE a minute and when i came back there was a huge puddle of water on the mattress.  It was as if somebody had taken a bucket of water and purposely spilled it on the mattress, everything was soaked. There are no air vents on top of where the mattress was and it didn’t come from beneath the floor bc the bottom of the mattress was dry. Last night my boyfriend got home home from work and we both immediately went upstairs. Not even five minutes later I asked him to go back downstairs to get me water. He went and at the bottom of the stairs there was another huge puddle, again def not from an air vent as there were none around. Freaked out we cleaned it up and tried to tell ourselves it was our dog having an accident even though our dog NEVER pees inside. She is a well trained dog and knows better. we went to sleep and ab five min later we heard a crash downstairs, turns out a broom had fallen, however this broom hangs on a hook, making it physically impossible for it to just fall off. idk what to do or even think anymore pls let me know if anyone has had a similar experience i am 100% convinced this is something paranormal. (we’ve always had diff paranormal things happen to us but this is the only constantly reoccurring one)",

She only paid 50 cents, so i thought to myself \"that's kind of cool\" and kept the teddy in my room while growing up. \n\nAbout 2 years ago I was watching random videos about haunted items. One of them was about teddy bears and it showed a picture that was identical to the one my mom brought home! I couldn't believe it! The video further stated that often times when a child passes away they put the urn inside of a teddy bear and the bears are often of a nicer quality (ex. 100% fur). Then these items end up at thrift stores and soon into someone news house. \n\nI was wondering on what you all think about this? I personally haven't noticed anything weird with it while growing up, but now everytime I visit my parents and see it I begin to wonder if that video had any truth to it.\n\nI have some photos of it but not sure if I can post them on here.",

Being a young, dumb kid we played with a ouija board. Well as expected it moved, creepy things happened and we all ran for our lives. I was the only one that didn’t go back and didn’t say goodbye to the board. I definitely opened a portal that will forever stay with me.\n\n\nFast-forward to the present: A lot of unexplained things happened over the years but recently have been getting bad. One that will always stick with me was when my poor dog got hurt. \n\n\nIt started when I was hanging out in my living room watching tv. My dog was in her cage(bed rest from oral surgery) in my room. I heard loud bangs on my wall that was shared with the living room. I originally thought it was my dog shifting in her cage and just happened to move the cage against the wall. Then I heard a loud crash and my dog yelping. I ran into my room to find my light had blown and shattered all over my floor and my drugged up dog shaking with all her fur up in her cage. I got her out and put her in the living room in a makeshift cushion fort while I cleaned up the glass. After I checked up on her in the living room and light knocks were coming from my room on the wall shared with my living room. My dogs tail was broken at the base(I brought her to the vet first thing in the morning) and she refused to step foot back in my room. \n\n\nAfter I got so mad that something hurt my dog I yelled to whatever or whoever it was that if it touched my dog again I’ll make sure to send it right back to where it came from and it’s gonna have to go through me to get to her. I woke up to a huge bruise on my back the next morning and I got my house blessed by the church the same night. I now sage my house and myself weekly and a lot of the unexplained things calmed down a lot. Every once and a while I’ll hear my name being called or loud bangs on my front door but ignore it.",

(Although I do watch Nuke's Top 5 and Bizarre Bub at times - it's mostly to see what they're capable of.)\n\nAnywhoozy, I was raised religious. Never believed in ghosts or anything at the time. Didn't believe in demonic possession (because I was a Protestant and not a Catholic.) Never believed in Big Foot, nor even Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. Obv never believed in Bloody Mary of the Candy Man, and other mirror world demons.\n\n*However* I came close to believe in cryptids. Shapeshifters. Thought they were biological beings from earth that were more advanced than humans. And because I'd seen scary faces, I thought they were evil. They looked sadistic. Proudly sinister and insidious.\n\nI once saw a girl named Erica across the street who smiled a sweet smile. But she had some weird crease in her cheeks. Like a second smile. Thought nothing of it because I thought she must sing a lot and tone her face up. (That *has* happened to me before. I sang a ton.) Then I see Carlos. He made me go crazy for a split second.  His eyes were large and all black. Jt took a while of smearing right has eyes to see his pupils. But they're were there. His eyes grew twice the sie of their previous more human eyes. His face looked Ike jt was made of latex or leather of something. And he smiled a smug smile. Humanly possible. (It was a smaller sized smile.) Then I see something that looked kind of like a Glasgow smile. A second smile. A crease in his cheeks. Kind of like a wry, shit eating grin. Like he knew I *kind of knew* and that I'd not remember right afterwards, but would later. Then there was Debra. She showed a face similar to Carlos. But when Debra drove away, I looked out my door to see what her face looked like. She knew I was looking even before we could see each other. She kept her smile, and made her mouth area bulge the way a chimp looks. (They'd called me a dog and a monkey by then, so I knew she was calling me a monkey there.) The. There was Frank. His face was more Human looking than the others. *BUT* his cheeks opened up **wide as hell**. As wide as Venom's mouth from the Marvel comics and movies. And his left cheek looked like it was sagging unnaturally low, with two vertical stripes in them. Something told me that face meant he was feeling disgusted and homicidal, and about ready to maul me. But proud as fuck and that I couldn't do shit. And so I was gonna be a toy of theirs. He is the one who actually led me to believe in shapeshifters. Then there was Eddie. Found out he wasn't human. He made a face that looked similar to Frank, but his cheeks stayed intact. Like it was a velociraptor looking  smile, but his cheeks didn't actually open up like Frank's did.\n\nAlso I should add that their eyes are jet black too. Eddie's eyes were usually brown, but they stayed black afterwards. Erica's eyes were such a light brown they looked yellow. Like she was sad as hell actually.\n\nAnd I do believe they're actually demons too. Like some people aren't human. Butvthey have powers that allow them to telelort, turn invisible, intermetamorph, change gender, and control their biological age appearance.",

        "text": "I (32M) have been experiencing this weird phenomenon in my old room in my parents house. I used to think it was the AC doing this since my room used to be next to the unit, but everytime time I would lay down in my bed, the edge of my bed would shake. It would shake like some kid was sitting on the edge of it and just bouncing up and down.\n\nThis happened for years, up until I moved out. I never really looked into it, i would be down reading or playing my 3DS, right when I laid down, the shaking started.\n\nOne day, while visiting my parents, I decided to lay in my bed in my old room. Like clockwork, the shaking started again. This time, I whipped out my phone and turned on Snapchat. Since I saw all those TikTok’s of ghost being captured with a filter, I thought “…there’s no way.”\n\nRight when I turned on the filter, two faces appeared: one at the corner of my room, the other by my bed. One upside down and the other normal. The shaking stopped. The one upside down immediately went away. The other came closer to the camera. I literally said out loud “GOT YOU, yeaaah see it shows your face.” The one face got larger, like it came closer to my phone. Then it disappeared.\n\nThe shaking stopped. Every now and again, I try to see if it would happened again when I visit. No more shaking.",

        "text": "This happened about six years ago when my son was four, I believe. We were with a group of friends at a hotel/resort in the woods for a weekend. They had cabins, hiking, usual outdoor stuff, and provided meals. It was lovely. \n\nOn the second night, they set up a bonfire, so we were all sitting around and talking. My son stood up and had his back to the fire and kept yelling to the dark woods \"Come on, it's okay,\" and \"Come over here.\" We thought it was just a strange four year old imagination and didn't think much about it. Eventually we went back to our cabin for the night. \n\nThe next morning a friend told me some information that made the whole situation way more, more.... The resort was run by a husband and wife team, who were also raising their granddaughter. The granddaughter's mom, their daughter, had completely disappeared. She had had drama in her life, but when she left, she was gone, no traces. There was fear that she had been killed. Her parents hired people to try and find her though, done everything they could (maybe still are), understandably. \n\nThe thing is, when we asked our son who he was talking to the night before, he told us he was calling the Dark Mama. Under the circumstances, I could never help but wonder if the Dark Mama is the missing daughter/mom. \n\nI could never find anything in the news about her unusual disappearance, but that story did fit with my son's behavior a little too well to be easily disregarded. I can't help but think she has been in those woods ever since she disappeared.",

This is where my grandpa had a spooky sleep paralysis once. My great-grandpa died in the 70s and my great-grandma in 2005 when I was 5 years old. I have only faint memories of her. Since then the house had no residents.\n\nMy dad likes to go mountain biking. One summer he decided to go on a two-day ride and spend the night in the house. He was sitting in the kitchen, where an old radio was plugged in and suddenly the radio just unplugs itself from the socket on the wall. What the hell?\n\nIf the plug just fell out, why would someone had plugged it in so half-assedly? Or do you think it were ghosts? Or just some physical phenomenon?",

        "text": "We've recently moved house and knew very early on the place is pretty active, including a cat which we hear and see regularly. When renovation work started a few months in the activity went off the charts.. electrics going nuts, kitchen appliances being messed with, lights being switched on and off, physical things being moved. Our electrician was very freaked out about things which started from the first day he was here.. presumably him drilling holes in the walls infuriated the spirits.\n\nIt's quietened down since the work stopped. We've become quite intrigued by tech created to communicate with spirits, I like the ones which use word banks or sound banks, rather than white noise type thing as I find that difficult to understand. I have an app on my phone, and some of the communication that's come through has been genuinely astounding, contextual and we have no doubt that spirit is telling us things about our house / things that have happened. A bit like a commentary!\n\nI have been cautious about using the tech too frequently at home, I don't want to encourage things too much.. but when something significant has happened we've turned the app on and I've been surprised at words coming through which describe the context, and at times have even been telling us about problems in the house lol. I genuinely think it's made me feel so much more connected and calm with the spirits whose house this also is, they've told me when something has upset them and I've been able to explain why we need to do work and 'please don't sabotage it again' 😂 \n\nI know some people will think the tech is nonsense, but then when you're living in a very haunted house that people won't visit because they're so freaked out, I suppose the perspective is a bit different! I'd love to hear about anyone's experiences that have been eye-opening like mine have, and if you've been able to communicate.",

        "text": "Hi all! I’ve had a lot of worsening anxiety and hormonal problems recently, so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if my home could have something paranormal going on. I’m new to this community, so if I’m doing something wrong please let me know.\n\nThe home we live in was my boyfriend’s grandmother’s home. She was the only person to ever live here. It was built for her by her son (my boyfriend’s father), and is on said son’s property (an estate with multiple buildings, all only occupied by immediate family), so it was quite the significant space for her. She willed the home to my boyfriend, who I already lived with, so we moved here last fall.\n\nThe only interesting thing that happened prior to us moving is my boyfriend’s father mentioning that outdoor lights had started turning on and off on their own. They worked on some sort of electrical thing, and it solved the issue. There is also a lamp in the house that does the same. We don’t have an explanation for the lamp.\n\nI had never noticed anything out of the ordinary until about a month ago. The house has always been sort of noisy in general (the water heater is ultra clanky, acorns fall on the skylights, birds hit windows, squirrels tap at the glass doors, lots of wildlife around, noises in the hall are amplified into the bedroom/closet due to layout…lots of easily explained noises that would catch you off guard if you didn’t know what they were.) \n\nA month ago, we brought home a puppy. While this would typically feel extremely unrelated, the puppy’s birthday is one day away from the one year anniversary of his grandmother’s passing. She started her journey out of the living world on December 13th, 2021, which was the last day my boyfriend was with her. He stayed until about 11:55pm. She passed away minutes after he left, just after midnight on December 14th, 2021. Puppy was born late at night on December 13th, 2022 and came home on February 15th. For what it’s worth, which may be a lot, she did pass away in the home. \n\nThe morning before we brought the puppy home, very early (around 4am. I am generally up around that time. I used to get up at 5 or 6, but it’s been 3 or 4am since we moved here) I was sitting in our sunroom admiring the fact that the very full moon was visible through our skylights. It isn’t generally aligned that way, and it was fascinating to look at the moon from inside my house. I have some photos I took on my phone, if anyone is interested. \n\nI saw what I felt was a shadow figure out of the corner of my eye, snapped my head to the left,  and it was gone. There is a tall grandfather clock right next to where I saw the figure, so I wrote it off as sleepiness and darkness making me see things. \n\nNow, we (mainly I) have started hearing noises we can’t explain. We frequently say “huh?” To each other because we heard talking, only to be met with a confused “I didn’t say anything.” We hear noises that sound like things hitting walls, loud pops, heavy objects falling, pipes bursting….but we never find the culprit. It always sounds like it’s damage being done to the home or inside of it. We both hear it, and typically so does the puppy. \n\nMy boyfriend has been traveling for work more than usual, and the occurrences seem more frequent and intentional when he is gone or asleep. He is currently sleeping, and I am writing this after hearing what sounded like a suitcase crashing down in the hall closet. There’s nothing there. It woke the puppy from a deep sleep. \n\nLast week, I smelled fire in the living room, but only in the exact space she passed. This week, in the same spot, it smells very electrical and metallic sometimes. The lamp has started turning on and off again. A mop fell over in the bathroom while I was taking a shower. I hear dog toys squeak from the area I saw the figure in, but nothing squeaked them and the puppy doesn’t notice. This is usually when I’m in the bathroom and out of sight of that room (puppy follows me. It isn’t her.) \n\nYesterday, the puppy brought me a past hospital bracelet of the grandmother’s. I don’t know where it came from. I know there was one in a drawer of keepsakes, but there is no way pup had access to that and it’s still there. \n\nI’m sure i will think of more occurrences after I post this, but does this sound paranormal to anyone? Am I making connections that don’t exist because I’m anxious?",
