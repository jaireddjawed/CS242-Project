Would Kenny have been fully charged with robbery and murder as well? Or would the fact he was effectively being blackmailed be taken into account? And would the police have gone after the blackmailers too? Surely there’d be more to this case, legally speaking, than just locking up a criminal teenager?",

        "text": "Holy shit was this an amazing, yet f*cked up series. I watched the first episode by myself, then instantly forced my girlfriend to watch with me and then we fell in love with it.\n\nBefore I get on with the list, I have a few honorable mentions;\n\n-Fifteen Million Merits (S1E2)\n-Metalhead (S4E5)\n-Nosedive (S3E1)\n\n\nAs promised, here are my top 10 favorite episodes.\n\n**#10: Hang the DJ (S4E4)**\n\nI knew I would like this one after reading the synopsis of it. It had a very intriguing plot, a couple that I was rooting for, funny moments, and (of course) mystery. It was one of those feel-good episodes and I really enjoyed the idea that all of it took place in their phones in order to match them up on a Tinder-esque app. \n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\n**#9: The Entire History of You (S1E3)**\n\nThis one f*cks you up on so many levels. At first you blame the guy who just seems to be overprotective and insecure. Then you find out that the girlfriend has been hiding something, but it was only the length of time she dated the douchebag. A few bad drunken decisions later, Liam finds out that the baby isn't even his. This episode was written so well, and it was one of the first ones that I fell in love with. I would soon compare the next few episodes to this one in terms of quality.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\n\n**#8: San Junipero (S3E4)**\n\nI don't know how this one goes down in terms of people's favorites, but I really liked it because it just felt like an actual movie to me. I usually am not a fan of huge romance movies, but this one really had a great atmosphere to it. I loved the idea of them traveling to different eras and I really enjoyed the portrayal of both main characters (especially Kelly). Her backstory was tragic, but she ended up staying in San Junipero with Yorkie. I will admit that this one nearly brought a tear to my eye, which is very rare. \n\nOverall Score: 8.6/10\n\n**#7: White Bear (S2E2)**\n\nThe entire plot for this was just so damn intriguing. It was very similar to The Purge and I just wanted to know what the hell was going on! It was very suspenseful and had me questioning so much until they finally revealed everything at the end.. and what a twist that was. I was so torn because I didn't know whether to feel sorry for her or not. I guess that's what you get with a lot of these episodes. This episode is the point in the list where the episodes start to get \"great.\"\n\nOverall Score: 8.9/10\n\n**#6: Playtest (S3E2)**\n\nI love scary and suspenseful movies, so I knew this one was going to be good. While it wasn't too scary, it was creepy enough to make me feel uncomfortable, especially that f*cking spider thing... dear Jesus. It had a great plot and a tragic ending that left me so speechless. Great episode.\n\nOverall Score: 9.2/10\n\n**#5: White Christmas (S2E4)**\n\nThis episode... holy hell was it amazing. The 2 stories that Jon Hamm (Matt) told were brilliant enough, but then they revealed Joe's whacky ass past and it was absolutely insane. Towards the end, I started to piece together that Jon Hamm was trying to pry information out of him, but it was a damn good twist. And to top it all off, Jon Hamm's past comes back to bite him in the ass as he is blocked by everyone. This episode had me SHOOK. \n\nOverall Score: 9.5/10\n\n**#4: USS Callister (S4E1)**\n\nAnother crazy episode that had me biting my nails, wondering what would happen next. I know that Robert Daly was neglected at his workplace, and I did feel bad for him, but torturing digital versions of the people who don't treat him well is just too far. I never expected the good guys to win in this situation because it is Black Mirror after all. Either way, I didn't know whether to feel bad for Daly (as it was only a game) or if he deserved it. Overall just a spectacular episode.\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10\n\n**#3: Shut Up and Dance (S3E3)**\n\nWhat. The. F*ck. This episode left me absolutely speechless. When me and my girlfriend finished it, we just sat there and didn't say a word for a few minutes. Never has an episode left me feeling so satisfied, yet uneasy, sad, and overall conflicted. Poor Kenny is getting blackmailed just for jacking off, which I thought he was just gay, but then they dropped that bombshell that he was looking at young girls and I was just blown away. That ending was just absolutely sad, and I honestly didn't know whether to feel bad for him or not! They just made him out to be so innocent that I couldn't help feel for him a little at the end. I mean he is going to get charged with child pornography, robbery AND murder...\n\nOverall Score: 9.8/10\n\n**#2: Hated in the Nation (S3E6)**\n\nThis episode was absolutely amazing all throughout. I literally felt like I was watching a Hollywood film. I am terrified of bees, so you can only imagine how squeamish I was when freaking MECHANICAL KILLING bees were the culprits to all the murders. The ending to this episode is what elevated it to one of my favorite episodes of the series, when they tried to retake control of the bees, only to have them reverse programmed to kill everyone who used the #DeathTo... And when we see the intern chasing down the guy who was responsible for it all.. chills everywhere. What an amazing episode.\n\nOverall Score: 9.9/10\n\n**#1: Black Museum (S4E6)**\n\nThis episode was just perfect. It had multiple tragic backstories, easter eggs to previous episodes, and a perfectly foreshadowed twist that ended with sweet justice and satisfaction. I have never been so satisfied to an ending of this show as I had been with this episode. When she takes the Care Bear (get it?), and we find out that her mom got to experience the revenge for Clayton as well, I just lost my mind. Definitely a strong finish to an amazing season and series (for now).\n\nOverall Score: 10/10",

        "text": "and I really don't understand the hate(maybe too strong of a word?) for The National Anthem. My buddy told me about Black Mirror and the first episode. He laid out the premise and it was the shock/comedic factor that really made me be like, ok this sounds fucked up, I will probably like it. I was totally expecting a full blown 45 minutes of comedy and WTF but I was really surprised by the depth and seriousness of the episode. I think the acting was superb, chilling, and real. While the premise is obviously WTF, it was done in a really amazing way that didn't come off as total bullshit. I thought it was an amazing episode. And the ending, oh my. The epilogue made it that much more deep for me, to consider that it was actually an art installation, holy shit. That is pretty damn deep. \nSo I thought the episode was great HOWEVER, Fifteen Million Merits completely took me off guard. It has been almost 16 hours since I watched it and it is still stuck in my head and I keep going over and over it. This is how I personally define a great show, song, art, etc... is when it is hours and days and weeks later and it is still on my mind.  It was just so harsh and striking and wow. Amazing. After reading a lot of posts and discussions about it, I see it is a series favorite and I can totally understand why. I do feel that episode 2 was leaps and bounds away from episode 1; however, I feel that episode 1 was great in its own right. I think The National Anthem was a perfect way to actually start the series IMO. I do think now that I need to limit myself to 1 episode at a time so that I can process everything! I haven't been this excited about a show in a long time. ",

I've been a bit obsessed with the whole exploration of \"what if phones but too much\" and have been doing a lot of reading, both fiction and non-fiction. Here are some of my recent favorites that fit the bill:\n\n- *Escape from Spiderhead* by George Saunders, available in his short story anthology *Tenth of December*. One of my all time favorite stories. It's about a guy who takes part in scientific experiments. I actually just found it for free [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/escape-from-spiderhead)!  \n- *The Circle* by Dave Eggers. I haven't seen the movie but I enjoyed the book, which has some fantastic memorable moments. It's about a tech company akin to Facebook and Google that gradually grows out of control and omnipresent.   \n- *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury. A classic that likely played a part in inspiring Black Mirror. It's about a world that's become so obsessed with shallow entertainment (ala Fifteen Million Merits) that they hate and burn books.  \n- *Amusing Ourselves to Death* by Neil Postman. A nonfiction cultural critique from 1985 about how TV as a medium has rendered us less capable of meaningful discourse for the sake of amusement and entertainment.  \n- *Hooked* by Nir Eyal. It's not a novel, but it's a guidebook for software developers on how to make their customers addicted to their products. It almost reads like a satire, but it's not. It's real.  \n",

Up until episode 5 , I thought the episodes were somehow part of the same story, so I told myself i'd keep watching until i'd get what was linking the episodes together...   But in doing so, I feel like I missed out on reflecting on that ..feeling, that state of mind Black Mirror leaves you in after each episode ends.\n\nAnyway, if anyone reads this and hasn't yet watched/finished the show yet, i'd strongly advise against binging it, for it did ruin part of the experience for me..  I'll probably try to avoid talking about BM up until the new season is announced, so as to try and forget as much as possible , and be ready for a proper rewatch, thorough and spaced  in between ",

        "text": "\"There are stories in which we do fling you \\(the audience\\) into a pit of despair and then piss on you, because people seem to like that\".\n\n The feelings and thoughts I had after hearing this later became a huge influence for a song to reflect my emotions over the subject.\n\n[https://youtu.be/\\_ux6gsHyZow](https://youtu.be/_ux6gsHyZow)\n\nThe scariest part of the show, for me, is the masocist majority of the audience. People choosing to feel hopeless, depressed and dark in their free time. Demanding creators to throw them into a deeper, darker pit each time. With it's creativity and ability to excellently reflect the possible dark, dystopic scenarios we could go through, one would think that the show would somehow make people more aware and cautious about certain things. But what I mostly see about Black Mirror fans is that, even though they are deeply terrified, worried and even depressed about the possible directions we could go with advancing technology, they don't want to change any relatable actions that they do on their daily lives. They see how addicted they are to the technology, but instead of working on changing this habit, they want creaters to create an even worse portrait of their situation. \"Show us how fucked up we are, show us how desperately addicted we are to the technology in many ways. We can't wait to feel extremely depressed!\" This is like some smoke addict watching anti smoking commercials non stop. Enjoying to see how smoking fucks up the body, enjoying feeling like a desperate person who can't stand 15 minutes without smoking something something that ruins him completely.\n\nIf people are not feeling ready to change anything about themselves, I would at least expect them to ignore these shows that shows them how harmful are the things that they're doing. But no. I think the creator of the show is highly aware of this situation, and I think this may be the saddest, most depressive and real fact about the show. As I said, the song reflects the rest of my emotions and thoughts with it's theme and melodies. Enjoy.\n\nI would love to receive opinions on the subject, especially from the fans here. Thanks",
