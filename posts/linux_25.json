        "text": "This was in August of 2022.\n\nThe first time I watched Stallman’s Ted talk, I didn’t think much of it. Like many people in the Linux community, I thought the GNU project was promoting an unnecessary radical ideology that wasn’t compatible with modern day technology.\n\nI couldn’t stop thinking about it for the following week, however. In order to be able to properly process it, I felt the need to watch it a second time, which is what I did. This time, I decided to pay a closer attention to details such as the colour code being used in the drawings featured on the slideshow.\n\nThe next day, I attended an electronic music festival with a friend and popped a pill of ecstasy. When I felt the initial effects, I wasn’t thinking about anything related to Linux. I felt like dancing to the music and talking to strangers. \n\nEventually, however, the memory of the Ted talk magically came back to me. This is when my mood suddenly shifted to a mix of panic and euphoria. What the drug did was give me the mental stimulation I needed to properly wrap my head around, and be initiated to, the philosophical implications of free software. At the slightly ominous rhythm of the electronic tune playing, I started to clearly perceive Stallman as a messianic figure of some sort.\n\nIt became clear to me that there are two reasons for his bad reputation. The first is people who precisely intend on sabotaging him to prevent him from giving users complete control over their devices. Canonical and Red Hat are not who I thought they were. Why would a South African millionaire space tourist want to help people have control over their devices for free? It’s a ploy to absorb the user’s freedom and lure them back to sketchy proprietary drivers no different than Microsoft trying to swallow Linux through the WSL or Google trying to swallow the AOSP through Google Play. Those proprietary blobs might seem like they’re just harmless blobs after all, but we precisely don’t know what’s in them, and that’s the whole point. When it comes to software freedom, it’s 100% or nothing. \n\nThe second is people who just don’t get it, in which case I suggest following in my steps by doing the same experiment as I did, i.e. watching the Ted talk and taking a mind expanding substance after. Cannabis alone can do the job, but it doesn’t compare to ecstasy for this purpose.\n\nWhat’s even crazier is that this wasn’t my first taking ecstasy, and during my previous trips the topic of Unix had come to my mind, but remember, GNU’s *not* Unix.\n\nFor my next ecstasy trip, I will be watching the video featured on the home page of GNU’s website, titled *Escape to Freedom*, while tripping, in the hopes that I will be able to make sense of the cryptic symbolism that it features, which as of now still remains a mystery to me. And I’ll of course be back to share my epiphany.\n\nOnly higher dimension beings will get this 😉 others will likely call me crazy",

        "text": "I've always had trouble with note taking, digitally. You open the file browser, browse to an appropriate directory to store the text file in, give it a proper name. If you're using a note taking app, you open it, you go to the proper notebook/section, you create a new note, you give it a name, maybe you have to worry about formatting...\n\nEnd result: text files everywhere in my system with random meaningless names: 111.txt, aa.txt, note.txt. Most of them probably were created for temporary needs and are now obsolete. Yet you're never not too lazy to find them and delete them. Imagine having to clean up every single thought you have in your brain as well?\n\nI often find the things between the idea in my head and the act of writing it down just very inefficient. And I've always dreamed of this simple yet effective solution. A note-taking app that is 24/7 running in the background. You open it with dragging the left or right edge of your screen, this spawns a sidebar, with a new empty note opened. And you JUST WRITE.\n\nThis app has 1 search/filter bar at the top, and all the notes are listed down sorted by the time of creation. Most recent at the top. You can pin/favorite. And optionally you can make notes auto-deleted by default unless you click on a \"keep\" button, if you find it tedious having to delete obsolete notes. And finally you can sort by type, if the note has a lot of `-` at the beginning of each line, that means it's probably a list and it *automatically* is marked as a list, this should make it easier to filter later out later on.\n\nFeatures can be expanded, but the base idea is the most crucial aspect. I have used many note taking apps, but I never really use them when I'm in a hurry and **just want to write down a random idea.** I see myself just create text files in the desktop or home to do that.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Today is y2k38 commemoration day\n\nI have [written earlier about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/xjtf3q/in_the_year_2038/), but it is worth remembering that in 15 years from now, after 2038-01-19T03:14:07 UTC, the UNIX Epoch will not fit into a signed 32-bit integer variable anymore. This will not only affect i586 and armv7 platforms, but also x86\\_64 where in many places 32-bit ints are used to keep track of time.\n\nThis is not just theoretical. By setting the system clock to 2038, I found many failures in testsuites of our openSUSE packages:\n\n* [mercurial](https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6778)\n* [tcl](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1203982)\n* [python](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101069)\n* [mariadb](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1203310)\n* [enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml/pull/516/files)\n* [libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1836) ... [twice](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1838)\n* [nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/20285)\n* [perl HTTP::Cookies](https://github.com/libwww-perl/HTTP-Cookies/pull/72)\n* [perl Time::Moment](https://github.com/chansen/p5-time-moment/pull/48)\n* [python-DateTime](https://github.com/zopefoundation/DateTime/issues/41) (fixed - this one is interesting as it involved rounding errors on a floating point value)\n* [python-bson](https://github.com/py-bson/bson/pull/117)\n* [python-softlayer](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/issues/1764)\n* [python-heatclient](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-heatclient/+/855083)\n* [python-aiosmtplib](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme/blob/a54f3188fcb/trustme/__init__.py#L44)\n* [python-tasklib/taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues/3050)\n* [xemacs](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1058331)\n\nIt is also worth noting, that some code could fail before 2038, because it uses timestamps in the future. Expiry times on cookies, caches or SSL certs come to mind.\n\nThe above list was for x86\\_64, but 32-bit systems are way more affected. While [glibc provides some way forward for 32-bit platforms](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/64_002dbit-time-symbol-handling.html), it is not as easy as setting one flag. It needs recompilation of all binaries that use `time_t`.\n\nIf there is no better way added to glibc, we would need to set a date at which 32-bit binaries are expected to use the new ABI. E.g. by 2025-01-19 we could make `__TIMESIZE=64` the default. Even before that, programs could start to use `__time64_t` explicitly - but OTOH that could reduce portability.\n\nI was wondering why there is so much python in this list. Is it because we have over 3k of these in openSUSE? Is it because they tend to have more comprehensive test-suites? Or is it something else?\n\nThe other question is: what is the best way forward for 32-bit platforms?",

        "text": "Recently I noticed an interesting open-source project: Zwin, a windowing system allowing you to work on both PC (on Ubuntu 22.04 or Arch Linux) and VR (currently Meta Quest 2 / Pro) more conveniently. Strongly considering it worth being shared to more communities, I decided to share it with this post, which is actually my first post on Reddit.\n\n(I have read the rules of this community and tried not to avoid them, but plz forgive me if I still missed anything.)\n\nIt features opening multiple 3D apps and 2D windows at the same time / same space in VR mode, just as what we are already used to when opening multiple windows and apps on a PC. It also enables placing each 2D window and 3D apps in different location in the space, so say you can have a 3D calendar app on the wall, a 2D window on the ceiling playing a movie, and a 3D game you are developing in front of you, and each of them runs independently and simultaneously while in the same space surrounding you.\n\nIt also provides a seamless switch between VR and PC. Say you have opened multiple apps and been working on them in VR mode, and then when you take off your HMD, those apps will remain the same status on PC so that you can seamlessly continue your work on PC, and vice versa.\n\nHere’s Zwin dev’s post on another community, which explains more details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality\\_linux/comments/10efbfg/introducing\\_zwin\\_xr\\_windowing\\_system\\_for](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality_linux/comments/10efbfg/introducing_zwin_xr_windowing_system_for)\n\nI actually followed their tutorial and tried Zwin on my own (on Ubuntu 22.04 and Meta Quest 2). Although experiencing some problems like the connection dropped at time (perhaps that’s just my PC’s problem?), waiting too long for the file manager to open, I like this project overall! Replacing VR controller with a ray from mouse is also a smart idea for me. It seems obeying what VR features, but I have to say this saves my arm muscle lol.\n\nHere's the recording I took when playing around on Zwin:\n\n*Processing video jh2ney7p5tca1...*\n\n*Processing video ldsgao6q5tca1...*\n\nAnyway this open-source project appears to be still under development, but I like its concept and really look forward to its future. Check out their website and try it out! [https://www.zwin.dev](https://www.zwin.dev/)",

The key shortcuts are doing my nut in but I'm coping.\n\nI've been told there's a distro called Elementary OS that more or less simulates the Mac environment, which I would like to switch to, but lots of tutorials say this will hard wipe my drive, which I assume will annoy IT.\n\nDoes changing over from Ubuntu over to Elementary OS really wipe the disk? Since my entire setup and personal device is Mac based (keyboard and shortcuts especially), there is a big incentive to just swap over to Elementary OS, to save my brain the constant context keyboard switching",

Users with limited mobility can also now use common  keyboard shortcuts to navigate the calendar grid and month selection  spinners. \n* Firefox builds in the Spanish from Spain (es-ES) and Spanish from  Argentina (es-AR) locales now come with a built-in dictionary for the  Firefox spellchecker. \n\nFixed:\n\n* Various [security](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-01/) fixes.\n\nChanged: \n\n* Effective on January 16, [Colorways](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/personalize-firefox-colorways)  will no longer be in Firefox. Users will still be able to access saved  and active Colorways from the Add-ons and themes menu option.  \n \n* On macOS, Ctrl or Cmd + trackpad or mouse wheel now scrolls the  page instead of zooming. This avoids accidental zooming and matches the  behavior of other web browsers on macOS.  \n \n* The Recently Closed section of Firefox View now equips users with the ability to manually close/remove url links from the list.  \n \n* The empty state messages and graphic components surfaced in  Firefox View for the Tab Pickup and Recently Closed sections have been  updated for an improved user experience.\n\nEnterprise: \n\n* Various bug fixes and new policies have been implemented in the latest version of Firefox. You can find more information in the [Firefox for Enterprise 109 Release Notes](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-enterprise-109-release-notes).\n\nDeveloper: \n\n* [Developer Information](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/109) \n* The ability to automatically break when code on the page hits an  events handler has been available since Firefox 69. Firefox 109 now adds  new support for the scrollend  \n event. To use this new event  breakpoint, open the JS debugger and find and expand the Event Listener  Breakpoints section in the right hand column ([learn more](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/set_event_listener_breakpoints/index.html)).\n\nWeb Platform: \n\n* The [scrollend](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollend_event) event is now enabled by default. The event is fired when a scroll has completed.  \n \n* Firefox now permanently partitions Storage in third-party  contexts independent of Storage Access to align with other browsers and  provide better Web compatibility.",

        "text": "In 2022, I said Plymouth was a roadblock that could prevent desktop distributions being able to disable VTs in their kernels. The reasoning was mostly because of how Plymouth's handling of keyboard input was reliant on VTs, and not the input devices themselves. However, the next version of Plymouth will now fix this.    \n    \nThanks to the work of /u/diegovsky_pvp and halfline and me, Plymouth now will use evdev keyboard input and xkbcommon keymappings instead, in the same way a modern and major display servers handle keyboard input. I also made a small tweak so that Plymouth can be forced to not fallback to serial console output when the kernel console is something like ttyS0, (which is the default on kernels compiled without VTs). However, for compatibility with serial logging, it will require a new `plymouth.graphical` option to be passed on the kernel command line, but this option will also imply `splash`. One note is that only Plymouth's graphical splash plugins will work without VTs. The fallback text mode splashes Plymouth ships with, such as tribar, won't work as those use the VT.    \n    \nI also have a waiting merge request so that when verbose mode is requested by pressing ESC, instead of hiding the splash and falling back to the VT to show the boot messages, the boot messages will be visible on the splash itself.     \n    \nTo celebrate the upcoming release of Rebecca Black's new album 'Let Her Burn' on 2023-02-09, and release of her single Sick To My Stomach on 2023-01-18, I am releasing ISOs of my Wayland Live CD with CONFIG_VT disabled, with the mentioned Plymouth changes, and other adaptions that will be mentioned below. The ISOs are not production worthy, please don't install expecting stability. They are here https://sourceforge.net/projects/rebeccablackos/files/2023-01-16/     \n    \nThese are reasons for why replacements for the VT subsystem are being sought after:    \n    \n   - VTs are not multiseat aware. This doesn't just mean that the VT consoles only work on seat0 (the primary default seat), but on machines that are capable and configured to have multiple seats, if seat0 has an active VT with no running display server (text mode), the VT console will receive keyboard input from all keyboards, even if they are configured in udev to be associated with a different seat that is not seat0. Basically any keystroke on the other seats will be picked up by the VT console, where sensitive keystrokes from other users could be made visible, such as passwords.    \n    \n  - VTs have limited character support, the kernel mode VTs only support a very limited number of glyphs. The documentation states it's only 256 characters normally, or if text color depth is reduced on the console, the limit is increased, but only to 512 characters. International keyboards are also more limited in the VT console.    \n    \n  - The VT subsystem is not as well-maintained as other subsystems in the Linux kernel. Even Linus Torvalds, who wrote a large portion of the VT subsystem very early in Linux's history, considers it \"bitrot\" now. A few years ago CVE-2020-14390 was discovered in the VT subsystem, which was the VT console corrupting memory when scrolling up in some conditions. When this issue was discovered, the best fix that the kernel developers did to avoid making large changes to code they consider to be fragile, was to simply prevent scroll up from working in the VT console. The commit message in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/973c096f6a85e5b5f2a295126ba6928d9a6afd45 provides further reference.    \n    \n  - VTs emulate a VT102 console in the kernel. While the VT consoles are text mode, they are almost close to a rudimentary UI running in the kernel in some people's opinion.   \n   \n  - Major display servers like Xorg, wlroots, Mutter (Gnome Shell's compositor), KWin, Mir, and Enlightenment all already can handle starting without VTs. Furthermore, logind already supports switching between multiple running sessions on seats without VTs, which these compositors also support. They are not directly dependant on switching VTs to do so anymore.    \n    \n  - Another bonus to not having VTs is that it allows even more reliable flicker free startup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92ybvTo05TY for an example.     \n      One small note is that this screen resolution is supported by the UEFI. On hardware where the BIOS/UEFI does not support the monitors resolution, there will be one flicker between GRUB starting the kernel, and the Plymouth splash starting.    \n    \n  - While some folks argue that VTs are more reliable than a user space console, VTs still need user space gettys, user space shells, and user space utilities for VTs to be interactive. If ld.so is badly messed up, there will still likely be issues starting /sbin/agetty for example.     \n    \n  - With SimpleDRM now in the kernel, Wayland display servers, including smaller ones that just start a terminal emulator program should be able to run on most hardware now with less work. This means that display servers don't need a fallback framebuffer backend anymore, as the SimpleDRM device will now be available, instead of having to fall back to the /dev/fb0 device.    \n    \nThere are some functionalities that will need further thought when VTs are removed:    \n   \n  - Kernel Panic display messages:    \n       These actually already don't really work well in most cases. In the rare case of a kernel panic, most Linux desktop users are probably currently not able to see most panic messages on screen.    \n    \n       *(DISCLAIMER: These below commands cause a kernel panic, they are for demonstration purposes only. Do not run in production)*    \n       To prove this point, a forced kernel panic on a kernel triggered by `sudo gdb -ex 'call (void)_exit(0)' --pid=1 --batch` or `echo c | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger` while a display server is running will seem like a sudden dead hang to most users. Nothing on the screen reacts.     \n       *(DISCLAIMER: These above commands cause a kernel panic, they are for demonstration purposes only. Do not run in production)*     \n    \n       This can even be the case if a panic happens when the VT console is active instead of a display server. If a DRM driver (DRM as in Direct Rendering Manager, not Digital Restrictions Manglement) is being used as the GPU driver, when the kernel panics, the VT console will appear to hang, unless if `nomodeset` is passed as a boot option, AND SimpleDRM is disabled, to where no DRM driver is used to display the VT console.     \n    \n       Furthermore as SimpleDRM is compiled directly into the kernel of many distributions now, and usually not as a module, very early panics will probably not even be visible to users anymore, as the SimpleDRM device is brought up early.    \n    \n       There are renewed recent talks from some kernel devs about adding a 'drmlog' ability to the kernel though to hopefully fix this.    \n    \n  - Initrd failure prompts:    \n       Currently when the scripts in the initrd fail in a way that it can't mount the root filesystem, they drop down to an `(initramfs)` prompt which is typically a simple busybox shell. This shell can assist knowledgeable users, or at least give a readable error message that may be helpful, currently this relies on a VT for the shell to run on to be interactive.    \n    \n       However, with a penalty of ~12MB worth of files, which is around a ~3MB hit to the compressed to the initrd image, pairing a terminal emulator like cage/foot works. If small changes are made to the initrd's script to call them when dropping to a shell, the fallback works. Desktop distribution's initrds like Ubuntu tend to be dozens of megabytes today with firmware and modules, so 3MB more is not as significant.    \n    \n       See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kviZHMGYSeo for a demonstration of this concept    \n    \n       A disclaimer is that the UI utilities do run as root in this circumstance, but since it already drops to a root shell, the harm is lessened    \n     \n  - Emergency init=/bin/bash:    \n       Extending the concept of the recovery prompt for the initrd, it is slightly different. init=/bin/bash will no longer work, instead something in the future, like init=/sbin/recinit could be used.    \n       In this example, init=/sbin/recinit starts the cage/foot combo. This feature was very useful in the development of this live cd.    \n       From the shell, `exec /sbin/init` to continue booting won't work though, as the shell isn't pid 1, however `/sbin/recinit` execs `init` when cage exits.     \n    \n       See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qv0SG1cU1k for a demo. One benefit is that CTRL+Z actually works here, as when bash is PID 1, weird things happen when a process is set to run in the background.    \n    \n       A disclaimer is that the UI utilities do run as root in this circumstance, but since it already drops to a root shell, the harm is lessened    \n    \n  - Standard Use Fullscreen terminal environment:    \n       Pairing cage/foot in script and making a .desktop file under /usr/share/wayland-sessions that starts it, so that it's a selectable wayland session from a display manager results in something that looks very similar to a VT console.    \n    \n       The cage/foot combo can also run a getty to where it can be for very minimal installs that would not usually have a full desktop or login greeter installed. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZjcBpSWCo for a demo     \n       While this might require more libraries to be installed on some systems that want a small footprint, it might actually be more secure since it's not running in kernel mode, and the UI components don't have to run as root like in the recovery circumstances, with some client/server trickery.    \n    \n       https://github.com/n3rdopolis/fakekmscon starts the getty process as root on a pty that a socat \"server\" provides. It then sets the owner of the communication socket file to allow a system non-root user to interact with it.    \n       The socat client that connects to it is called by foot that runs under cage, which all start as a non-root system user.    \n      \n  - CTRL+ALT+F(x) bindings:    \n       These actually work without VTs already (but only if there are two or more sessions running on the seat to actually switch between). Most display servers already currently listen for CTRL+ALT+F(x), and they use logind's multiseat aware SwitchTo() dbus method, instead of the VT_ACTIVATE ioctl to change VTs.     \n    \n       As far as being able to switch sessions when the display server is hung, even today display servers call the KDSETMODE and VT_SETMODE ioctls if they are starting on a VT. By doing so they take over, and make themselves responsible for handling changing the session, instead of the VT subsystem.    \n       In simple terms, if the active display server becomes irresponsive, it's difficult to switch between running sessions, even with VTs.    \n    \n       It is possible in theory that some sort of feature could be added to logind that starts a cage/foot getty on the seat when a rescue key sequence is pressed to reduce these concerns. Perhaps it could be something like CTRL+ALT+PrtSc three times within 1 second.    \n    \n  - Ability to start a secondary display server, or \"bare-metal\" instances of ffmpeg without a display server:    \n       From a VT, if `weston`, or `sway`, and the like are run, they start with their DRM backends, and take over the VT. There are also other programs or toolkits (like Qt) that have DRM or FBDEV backends that can be run directly without a display server.    \n    \n       This is still technically possible, but it will require cooperation from the display server or session. The display server will need to suspend being a display server, and surrender control, wait until the guest display server stops, then regain control.    \n    \n       This is possible in a demo capability in the Fullscreen Terminal session. The actual shell prompt and child processes run on a pty provided by socat, and cage runs foot, which runs the socat client.    \n       running `uvtty-launch command` stops the cage/foot frontend, and inhibits it from starting back up, until the child process quits, or it detects that nothing gained control of the logind session within a timeout.    \n    \n       See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJ3Fc77tRI for a demo.    \n    \n       This only works when the instance of cage/foot is running as the user started by the display manager, and NOT the solution that runs the login getty presented by cage/foot. This is because the non-root system user is the owner of the logind session on the seat, and not the logged in user, so they don't have permissions to stop the processes, or gain control of the logind session to run their own display server under the session.    \n    \nThere are other smaller things that probably need to be changed upstream in the future before real distros begin to compile their kernels with CONFIG_VT=n    \n    \n  - Cage and Foot might not be the final agreed upon display server and terminal emulator combo that ends up being used. And the use of a socat client/server might not be what is used to allow the privileged getty to be displayed by an unprivileged terminal emulator. A better solution might end up being developed by real distros.   \n    \n  - systemd's recovery console service probably should be modified to launch cage/foot, or whatever becomes the standard kmscon equivalent.    \n    \n  - Some casper scripts in Ubuntu call `chvt` and `setupcon` which leave errors in the journal. There are no adverse effects from these commands running in the scripts, but it's still worth guarding these with if statements that check for /dev/tty0\n    \n  - There are other small things that might pop up, for example, Ubuntu's console-conf script which modifies the getty for a onetime setup assumes VTs. The fakekmscon cage/foot combo has the ability for a script to easily replace the getty, but it's a demo.    \n    \n  - Display *managers* (the things that handle logging in and greeters, like SDDM, LightDM...) were not all tested without VTs. Multiseat aware ones, like GDM should probably work already though.    \n    \n  - There are probably other refinements that need to be made in other utilities and scripts that make assumptions about VTs existing. They will probably need to be found through testing.    \n    \n  - Probably lots more testing, it's a major change to the way many have been using Linux.    \n    \nFor being able to disable VTs, most of the technology is probably there. Except maybe for drmlog in the kernel for kernel panic messages. However as even kernels with VTs struggle to show panic messages to the users in the majority of situations, this is hardly a show stopper.",
