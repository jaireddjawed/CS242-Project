This is my 17th century chapter, which focuses on the victimisation of women in the early modern period. \nI then have a chapter focusing on 19th century literature, which looks at the witch figure as a representation of the anxieties of unruly women, but am seriously struggling to find any novels or short stories that I can discuss. I do have The Lancashire Witches: A Romance of Pendle Forest by William Ainsworth, but I'm really running out of things to say, and I'm not sure if it really fits with what I want this chapter to be about. Does any one know of any other 19th century literature that show the witch figure as the representation of the anxieties of unruly women?\nI'm also struggling to find any literature that depicts the witch as beautiful, instead of the common old hag. So if anyone knows of any texts that show the seductress side of the witch then please let me know!\nThank you!",

Hopefully I'll find some way to tie all of this together into a more general point about Bloom's psychology.\n\nAnyway, I have a few secondary sources I've been working with, but I was wondering if anyone is aware of some critical examinations of the role of animals in literature.

Not being a native English speaker, I am unsure of my own translation of \"idea-analytical\", and I'll try to characterize what I mean by this. An idea-analytical method I view as a method that primary focuses on philosophical content in a text, posing questions such as \"what of Nietzsche's thoughts can be traced here?\", but also possibly using a more biographical method (\"did x read Nietzche?\"). So then, to my question. It feels like it would be reasonable to suppose that  the way a text construes themes is supported by underlying philsophical interests. That it to say, for instance, that if a text treats the topic of what it means to be a small individual in a large and confusing world, i.e. some kind of existantlistic theme, then it would probably be interesting to use the ideas of, say, Camus or Sartre as a lens for analyzing the text. Now, is there anyone that has written on how ideas substantiate thematic content? Or is it plain common sense, and can I then safely and surely just postulate this on my own in a academic paper?\n\nBest regards\nHansgreger",

        "text": "In Pragmatics and Fiction (1985) on p.43 I read the following assertion: \n\nSpeech act theory briefly held out the hope for many literary critics that linguistic analysis had at last provided a golden key for literary interpretation. But once it was realized that this was not the case (for there was no such key), the enthusiasm with which speech act theory was taken up soon faded. So speech acts have a rather ambivalent position within literary criticism, for on one hand they are recognized and even refered to frequently, but on the other hand they have not been given the close attention that this very recognition implies they deserve. \n\nWould anyone tell me actually how the enthusiasm with which speech act theory was taken up soon faded? What actually happened and what were the reasons behind? \n\nPersonally (though I may be wrong on this), I do not think the debate between Derrida and Searle has come to anything very helpful in establishing a literary speech act theory or even a school of literary criticism. Derrida, although he writes a lot on literature, is busy in deconstructing or laying bare the power relationships embedded in a myriad of dichotomies in the traditional philosophy. J. Hillis Miller, Derrida's buddy, is impressive in refuting J. L. Austin's claim that fictional or literary utterances are parasitic on speech acts in real life, which usually have immediate impact on others, but his three forms of doing things with words in literary production (Literature as Conduct: Speech Acts in Henry James, p.2) gives me the impression that he is trying to blend together at least the authorial intent theory, literary pragmatics, and the reader-response theories but to no avail. Besides, his actual textual analysis is not anything new but the traditional semiotic interpretation. Judith Butler's sexuality performance theory is not exactly the same thing as J. L. Austin's \"the performative\", which refers to speech acts in real life that most of the time leads to an immediate response or impact or legal consequence. But, to my understanding, Butler's performance theory, in stark contrast, is about cultural performance which may bring about some effects but not immediately or in the short term. \n\nAnyway, after all these turns and twists, Austin's \"the performative\" or what we now call performativity finally derives two mutually inclusive and also mutually exclusive layers of sense-- that is, immediate consequence vs intangible long term effects. Again, I have found that Derrida and Butler have no real interest in establishing a literary speech act theory and their interests lie elsewhere. And J. Hillis Miller tries to place the three literary traditions of authorial intent, literary pragmatics, and reader-response theories under his new umbrella of \"literature as conduct\", which is actually nothing new, but it seems to me he has failed in this dreamy endeavor since these three parts of his blending are too loosely connected and unattractive to other scholars so that no one else follows his lead in this direction which points back to old ways. \n\nWhat do you think of my understanding that speech act theory for literary criticism is more a methodology or perspective or tool than a theory? Thanks a lot.",

We have to do a close reading of the following excerpt from Kurt Cobain's Journals, and I've been staring at the page for an hour, unable to come up with anything. Any insight would be helpful.\n\nHere's the excerpt:\n\n\"I like following the rise of entertainers’ career while they struggle to make it. I like to know everything about them, and if enough information isn’t available, then tabloids will be sufficient. I like punk rock. I like girls with weird eyes. I like drugs (but my mind and body won’t allow me to take them). I like passion. I like things that are built well. I like innocence. I like and am grateful for the blue collar worker who’s existence allows artists to not have to work at menial jobs. I like killing gluttony. I like playing my cards wrong. I like various styles of music. I like making fun of musicians whom I feel plagiarize or offend music as art, by exploiting (pushing) their embarrassingly, pathetic versions of their own work. I like to write poetry. I like to ignore other’s poetry. I like vinyl. I like nature and animals. I like to swim. I like to be with my friends. I like to be by myself. I like to feel guilty for being a white, american male. I love to sleep. I like to fill my mouth with seeds and spit them out at random as I walk. I like to taunt small, barking dogs in parked cars. I like to make people feel happier and superior in their reaction towards my appearance. I like to feel prejudice to people who are prejudice. I like to make incisions on the belly of infants then fuck the incisions until the child dies. I like to dream that someday we will have a sense of generational solidarity amongst the youth in the world. I like to make insidious efforts to avoid conflict. I like to have strong opinions with nothing to back them up besides my primal sincerity. I like sincerity. I lack sincerity. These are not my opinions. These are not words of wisdom. This is a disclaimer, a disclaimer for my lack of education, for my loss of inspiration, for my unnerving quest for affection, and my perlunctory shamefulness towards many who are of my relative age. It’s not even a poem. It’s just a big pile of shit like me.\"",

I've been looking at purchasing Harold Bloom's The Invention of the Human and was wondering if this is a good purchase or if anyone from this sub has suggestions. Thanks much!",

        "text": "Hullo all,\n\nI'm looking for some material on Katherine Mansfield as part of a dissertation chapter I'm writing up at the moment. The focus is on the significance of the psychological and 'dream worlds' in establishing (or problematising) ones identity and position in the social order. \n\nSo I'll be chatting about how Brill is super lonely and desperate, and fashions a dream world in order to integrate herself and find a place in the real world which appears to have left her behind - but any further reading you lovely lot could suggest would be wonderful. \n\nAs a reward, a quick recommendation to anyone with a bent for modernism; Abbie Garrington's fantastic 'haptic modernism' is magnificent. Somewhat unrelated to the question above, but there you go. ",

I'm interested in Frank O'Hara and I would like to make a thesis based on some of his poems (up to ten examples).\n\nI suck at determining metre but I see it as a challenge.\n\nDoes anyone have any favorite poems, any notable ones I shouldn't miss? Any O'Hara fans in here? Allen's Collected Poems provide a super vast pool of possible choices so I would be glad for some tips. I'll handle Google, but I'm interested in your opinion :)\n\nThanks :)",
