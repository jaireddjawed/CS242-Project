        "author": "Kanukler",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/9inoea/ive_studied_japanese_for_exactly_a_year_yesterday/",
        "text": "I like to keep track of when I started doing things, so I know that it's been exactly a year and one day since I began my endeavor to learn Japanese!\n\nThe reason I'm making a thread about it is because I thought it would be nice to for people who are just starting, or thinking of starting, to see how much progress you can probably expect to make in a year, given (mostly) consistent studying.\n\nKeep in mind that I started learning primarily to read manga and play games, so my abilities go reading &gt; writing &gt; speaking (because I can speak slowly) &gt; listening\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Progress:**\n\nWith minimal effort, I can read enough to understand what's going on at any given point in a manga or game, but miss out on some of the finer details, and occasionally get lost in more complex stories.\n\nIf I spend a bit more time on it, use a dictionary, and occasionally look up grammar points, I can usually get the broader context as well. But I sometimes still miss out on a few things and get lost. This takes a lot more effort however, and I mainly do it to study.\n\nIf you're looking for more tangible progress, I'm on Chapter 6 in Tobira, and I fully understand everything up to that point. I could also probably pick any chapter and be able to more or less understand it right away (Though I'd need to use a dictionary). I also know 1000+ kanji and probably 2000+ words\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Studying:**\n\n There were weeks where I didn't study at all, and weeks where I studied 4+ hours a day. But most of the year I've been studying for about 1-2 hours a day. In the beginning I studied very little, but I slowly began to do more and more as time went on. \n\nI also took **VERY** relaxed lessons at a Japanese school where I live. They progressed very slowly compared to me, and following their pace, It'd be 5 years before I got to where I am now ( in reading ability ). I don't consider it a rip off or anything though, because the lessons were extremely cheap. It was \\~$600 for about 9 months of weekly lessons. I did find them helpful too, not necessarily because I learned much in them, but because every time I went, it would motivate me to keep studying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials used:**\n\nMy primary resources were (are) Genki I, Genki II, Tobira and The Kodansha Kanji Learners Course.\n\nSecondary resources were (are) Anki flashcards (kanji damage, core 2k/6k), [Renshuu.org](https://Renshuu.org) , Tae Kim's guide and various articles and media online.\n\nI would say that the best resources of the ones I used are the primary ones I listed above, if only because I prefer reading from books.\n\nAlso, [Renshuu.org](https://Renshuu.org) is probably the online resource I've spent the most time with, as it has preset vocabulary and kanji schedules for every book I use, and allowed me to study as much or as little as I wanted per day and was in general easier to use than Anki. It's also has a cute aesthetic that I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nI think the biggest challenge that faces learners including myself is probably motivation, so I'll talk about what kept me going for a year, and also the things that would slow or halt my progress.\n\nI think the fact that Genki is so digestible and has cute characters each with their own little arcs was part of what kept me going for a long time, along with my Japanese classes as I mentioned above. \n\nThe biggest halts in my progress were always at times when I wasn't going to school or work. I think motivation is tied very heavily with momentum, and you have to create a balance between the amount of energy you have in a day and the amount you get done. If you do too little, you'll do less the next day, but if you do too much you'll become exhausted and not want to do anything the next day instead. This is different for everyone and something you'll need to figure out.\n\nAnother important point is to have a place where you enjoy being to study in, as well as using resources you enjoy studying. Anything you can do to make the process of learning easier the better. **DON'T STUDY WHAT YOU THINK WILL MAKE YOU LEARN THE FASTEST**, if you do you'll burn out and stop studying, and probably forget a lot of what you learned that way. If you study at a gentler pace in a way you that's not too painful, you'll get there eventually. If at any point the idea of studying fills you with dread, you need to change something with what you're doing, and soon!\n\nMy final motivation tip is to always keep the end goal in mind, keep your eyes on the moon! For me, that means thinking about being able to read manga, games and light novels with minimal dictionary use. I also have several Japanese mangas and a VN I check every few months, just to see how much more I understand than I did the last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In Closing:**\n\nI don't know if my progress is typical or not, and I definitely still have a long way to go. I also think I could've made much more progress, but I'm still extremely proud of the amount I've done, and you could make just as much or more in a year if you wanted to (and haven't already!).\n\nWelp that's it! Thank you so much for reading up to now. If you have any questions or comments about anything, or even if you just need a pep talk, feel free to post below!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Problem is, the only way I know how to say “slow” is おそい and that seems more about physical speed than business being slow, and “おそいですね” doesn’t seem like it’d get the message across. My question is this: what adjective best describes “slow” as in “business is slow”? Thanks lots.\n\nP.S. my kanji knowledge is non-existent, so furigana is much appreciated.",

I've learnt how to read and write about 100 kanji in the past month so my progress is slow. However, I think I'm going to pause learning new kanji and learn vocabulary with these kanji in them. I've already started and I must say it really helps learning the vocabulary as these kanji are pronounced differently depending on context.\n\nBased on your experience, do you think it is effective learning more kanji or should I focus on the core vocabulary of the kanji I know and move on when I'm comfortable although it's much slower doing so?\n\nThanks in advance for your replies.\n\nTLDR: I've learnt to read and write about 100 kanji in the past month. Should I take a break in learning new kanji and focus on core vocabulary of these kanji in words or should i continue learning new kanji?\n\nEdit: typos xD",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nWith RTK (Remember the Kanji) you do not learn any vocab for each new kanji. With wanikani you do. With KKLC (kodansha's kanji learner  course) you can do either.\n\nI think one reason that kklc teaches vocab is to learn the readings and reinforce the meanings of the kanji. But the reason that the book fives in the front matter is that knowing at least one vocab per kanji allows you to write it on a computer (as in typing かんたん, changing that to 簡単 and erasing the first kanji to produce 単) and talk about the kanji (as in saying \"簡単の単\").\n\nI'm currently about 800 kanji in kklc. In kklc there are a couple example words for each kanji. Of those one or two are marked for memorization. I use a anki deck that I modified to test on the recommended vocab. \n\nI'm thinking of stopping learning the vocab for a couple of reasons. First, my retention rate for the vocab doesn't seem to be that great (though that's just my impression, I've tried to confirm this with by studying my Anki statistics). Second, with the deck I use I don't get example sentences or audio with the vocab. I think it would be more efficient to learn vocab as I encounter it in my readings or in word frequency order, for example from the core 2k anki deck.\n\nThe reason I hesitate to drop the vocab is that I'd like to be able to efficiently look up kanji only words. Looking up unknown words is also one reason why I'm a little afraid of reading texts without furigana. My experience with searching kanji by compound (as in [jisho.com](https://jisho.com)) wasn't very good. Handwriting recognition tends to work, but I can only do that on my phone, not on my desktop computer.\n\nMy question on people who have done RTK, how do you look up words of which you've learned the kanji in RTK?",

        "text": "So I recently [posted a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/9hwtqz/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_listening_practice/) discussing how I was using English subs during the second listen of an anime episode (first listen was sub-free), to help me transcribe the Japanese I was not able to pick up the first time. For me, that was 28 lines out of about 350. Meaning, the remaining \\~320 lines I could understand the first time, no subtitles, all Japanese audio.\n\nI knew opinions would be controversial since many learners seem to think that using English at all for any part of Japanese practice is horrible and cancels any benefit you might be gaining.\n\nYet after submitting the thread, I had a Japanese native (a friend I made on Tandem) go through each part of the anime with me that I transcribed, and check each of those 28. He said all of my transcripts were perfect except one. I'd heard「中には」instead of「の子には」for line 19.\n\n**Now here lies the question of debate.** If I was able to correctly reproduce the Japanese being spoken (NOT my best attempt at a Japanese translation from only referencing the English subs, but *the exact words the characters were actually saying*) for 27 of those 28 lines, how was I *not* still exercising my Japanese listening skill (as well as vocab and grammar recognition skills)?\n\nI want to get to the bottom of this criticism of \"Eng subs can never help you improve your Japanese and they can only ever hurt your progress\" -- because it runs really counter to my experience doing this exercise, especially having a Japanese person confirm that my 聞き取り was near flawless. Even when I told him I looked at the English subs the second time to create those transcripts, he told me that there are many ways I could've translated those English subs into Japanese, but I was able to pick the words and grammar, 漢字 included, that actually matched the characters spoken words, so it still shows a lot of skill.\n\nSo really, what is the basis for such a vehement avoidance of the L1 in cases like this? Especially when the alternative is just straight up looking at the J-subs, or asking a J-person what was being said. That wouldn't require any skill or effort at all in decoding the spoken language.\n\nI'd really like to hear some *well thought-out* responses that take into consideration what I've said here. Thanks for reading.",

Is the ほど after 後にあれ the ばーほどー grammar point? https://japanesetest4you.com/flashcard/learn-jlpt-n3-grammar-%E3%81%B0%E3%81%BB%E3%81%A9-bahodo/The 新完全マスターN3 grammar book says that the ば is optional, so i'm thinking that it has just been left out here? \n\n2. Am I right in thinking that this is the same きっかけに grammar point that is mentioned in the links above? \n\n3. If it is, then why is the を particle not used in this sentence? The JapaneseTest4You link has it included, and the Jgram link even says that is it mandatory to include it. Is this true? \n\n4. What is the meaning of とも言える? I have found these two links that mention it. https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/29954/x%E3%81%A8%E3%82%82%E8%A8%80%E3%81%88%E3%82%8By-and-%E3%81%A7%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E3%81%8C%E6%95%85%E3%81%AB-at-the-end-of-a-sentence and http://selftaughtjapanese.com/2015/12/18/japanese-grammar-focus-tomo-%EF%BC%88%E3%81%A8%E3%82%82%EF%BC%89/ The first one says it can roughly mean 'X could (also) be called Y', the second one is just kinda saying how と and も can be used together. I don't think it is being used how the second link is describing, I just thought I'd include it in case. \n\n5. How would you translate this sentence? \n\nMy attempt of a translation is: Above all else, it is said that as a result of our actions, the more life we have, the more we have to lose, in our unconscious, we must have our motivation.   \n\nThe use of all the grammar points is whats tripping me up. \n\nSorry if these are simple mistakes, this is my first time reading a book in Japanese. \n\nThanks for your help.

For each new Kanji will use pen and paper at least 5 times, but for reps I switched from *no writing* to *finger-writing* at around 1200. This switch only added about another 5 minutes or so to my daily rep time of i+25 (~150 reps).\n\nAt first I didn't want to write out every single rep on paper because it felt over the top and inconvenient. I just needed to remember the structure, but it dawned on me that I should be baking the characters into my kinetic memory somehow.\n\nAnyways, now when I'm knocking out my RTK reps I am writing down the Kanji each time using my finger on the desk before revealing. I find that it's a nice balance of speed and convenience. It is wiring me up kinetically, and creates a concrete output that I can score myself on instead of a previously imaginary output.\n\nI started doing it because I head that Japanese people will practice like this on their hand (writing out a character with their finger on their other hand).\n\nAnyways, right now I feel like this solution works pretty well for me. I will of course be regularly practicing my proper writing in sentences in the future, but in order to get through RTK this feels like a good balance.",

I need the pressure of being in a course to really motivate me.\n\nOnline will offer the most flexibility, and I can work on my conversation with friends and coworkers.\n\nIn-person classes would be ideal, but I can only do weekends and evenings, and it would have to be on the Keio Line in Tokyo.\n\nAny recommendations?",

        "text": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearning Japanese, this is my second attempt, tried a year ago but things go too busy on a personal level. I am now fully committed and started RTK. I don't want to start any debate on potential alternatives, I will stick to RTK but I am keen to hear from the people on this forum if they only focused on recognizing the kanjis or writing these as well. I have taken the approach of knowing how to write each one which is more intensive and harder obviously but I can see how some people might challenge this approach given that these days with internet and all the word processing you don't actually write that much anymore and instead with computer/phones 90% of the time you would type the sound of the kanji and then recognize it hence writing kanjis might be less valuable today than before. However I do plan to move to japan at some point in time so keen to do the right thing. Any views here ?",
