        "text": "#Why I believe what I believe\n\nAt any given time, why do I believe what I believe? Do I “believe” in something because it sits well with me? Because the people I respect believe in the same thing? For some, these may sufficient reasons to believe something, but have never been enough for me. I “believe” in something because The evidence leads me to that conclusion. As a teenager, the evidence led me to believe in the existence and omnipotence of the god of the Bible, Yahweh, as described by the teachings of evangelical Christianity. A god who establishes intimate relationships with his followers and loves and cares for them unconditionally. \n\nTo me, the evidence was conclusive. I looked on the outside secular world as blinded and deluded. How could they not see? What about the myriad of prophecies documented in the Old Testament that were fulfilled thousands of years later? How about the evidence for the reliability of the accounts in the New Testament? What about the intricacies of biology that modern science has revealed, intricacies impossible to arise through the mechanism of evolution: of chance mutations plus natural selection? And what about accounts of miracles and other supernatural events? What about the fact that our earth is so perfectly situated to support life? That our *universe* is so perfectly situated to support life? \n\n#The early years\n\nImagine me as a confident 14-19 year sitting around, spending my free time pouring over the books of much smarter Christian men, adding to my arsenal of ammunition against the unbeliever, and scales of armor against the attacks of the atheist. Michael Behe made me sure evolution couldn’t have happened. Josh McDowell assured me that the bible must be true. \n\nThe point is that I *needed* this stuff, this evidence to justify my faith. It always slightly bothered me that my friends didn’t. They were happy with the Christianity of their parents’, their school, and their church. But how would they defend their faith when they left all of that and went to college? Even if they weren’t ready, I would be. \n\nI saved an online exchange with a high school friend that occurred in 2008, when I was still certainly a Christian. It demonstrates this rational approach I had to life and “faith”:\n\n**Her**: “…facts and figures are nice support, but ultimately it comes down to the question of whether you have put your faith in God or somewhere else.”\n\n\n**Christian Me**: “Remember not to put your faith in God blindly. You should be putting your faith in God BECAUSE of the facts and figures: the evidence.”\n\n\n#College \n\nI started school at University in 2006, and immediately found my place with Campus Crusade for Christ, or CRU as it was fashionably called. I became actively involved with both my dormitory “small group” (weekly Bible study with 10-20 guys in the same building), as well as the larger campus group as part of the “Freshman committee.” This responsibilities of this committee included planning a retreat for the freshmen and some other duties which I no longer remember (but involved lots of prayer).  Although I made close friends with the people in my freshman classes, when push came to shove I would spend my time with the CRU kids.  I got paired up with senior students to mentor me during my development as a Christian leader. I actively discussed my faith with my non-Christian friends, and sought to “witness” to them as best I could, while still being a cool kid and not “that annoying Christian guy.” Surprisingly, I was actually good at it. I maintained my secular friendships, and even got a some of them to come to Friday night worship services on occasion, or to consider or join the bible study. \n\nBy sophomore year, I was leading Bible studies in the dorms. An older student named Joe (now a full time missionary in Asia) was my “discipler.” I dreaded, yet looked forward to our weekly meetings in the library on campus. I dreaded it because I knew my discussions with him would lead to conviction that I was not spending enough time in the “word,” or not witnessing enough to my peers. But I loved it because I wanted to be challenged that way. I knew that an ever deepening relationship with God required it, and I could not be a sincere example to the younger guys without it. \n\n#The Questions Begin\n\n###Does Prayer Work?\n\nFor spring break in 2008 I spent the week in Panama City Florida, the #1 party spot in the United States. But I wasn’t partying. In fact, I was a voluntary virgin (not that I didn’t push the boundaries when presented with opportunities) who had never took a sip of alcohol, and I was combing the beaches, handing out tracts to partiers. Basically I would walk up to people and attempt to engage them in discussions of the spiritual realm and their after-death prospects. Don’t get me wrong. I wasn’t enjoying this. An internal war was waging. It felt extremely awkward to walk up to the random bros, babes, and beer drinkers and try to talk to them about the LORD. I did not *want* to have these awkward conversations (I wanted to join them!), but was that just my sinful nature or Satan seeking to turn me from a path that would save people from an eternity in hell? Luckily I had an upperclassman CRU member with me to encourage me as we walked around the beach.\n\nThe beach witnessing only occupied a few hours each day. The rest of the week involved free time with some of my closest friends on the earth. We hung out playing board games, talked with the pretty girls in CRU, had a blast being guys and playing sports on the beach. We also had some pretty awesome sessions with great student-led worship music and messages from great speakers. The concentrated dose of spirituality was euphoric, yet part of my rational brain still questioned. In fact, at this time, there was one particular question bothering me: *Does prayer really work*? \n\nI can’t recall if this question was on my mind because of the messages given by the speakers at the retreat, if I was disappointed at the results of my own prayer, or if it were simply a philosophical question on my mind.  However, I do remember bringing up my internal struggle to one of my mentors and closest friends, Mike, who would go on to become my discipler when Joe left the following year.  I shared the trouble I had in reconciling an omnipotent, omniscient god with one who could “change his mind” (paradoxical for such a god) when considering the prayers of individuals. In a similar vein, it bothered me for some reason to hear my mother say “Thank God for protecting your brother” a year later when my brother survived a nasty car accident with a gash on his forehead.\n\nMy response (only some of which was actually said outloud): “What do you mean by that mom? Do you really believe that god reached out and supernaturally altered the laws of physics to keep him from getting more seriously injured? Did an angel really nudge him a few centimeters to the left to keep him from a worse injury?”\n\nThink about the times you have heard people talk about their success in prayer. I just read a testimony of a scientist who worked in a lab who often relied on prayer for strength through the long and tedious shifts. God never failed to calm him and get him through the day. It strikes me as odd that this individual never prayed for successful outcomes of his experiments, or for his boss to suddenly let him go home early. Is it coincidental that the prayers God always seems to answer are those whose results are indistinguishable from psychosomatic states of mind or placebo? I’ve heard it asked in an enlightening way: “Why are the aisles of the church after a faith healing littered with crutches and hearing aids, but not prosthetic arms or insulin kits?”\n\nGradually, I relinquished my belief in the power of prayer, yet tried to maintain the rest of my faith. Unfortunately, like a tower of cards, only a few components of the base can be removed before the whole thing comes tumbling down.\n\nYet the tower stood for a while with no externally visible sign of weakness.  I had brought my Roman Catholic roommate into the CRU community during sophomore year, and he was becoming quite the leader himself. This was a fantastic win for the LORD! The Catholics are tricky because they may think they are saved, but are often in danger of hell because they don’t believe in a “grace-only” salvation.   He and I had chosen to stay in the dorms for a third year, specifically to disciple younger students and maintain a leadership position in the dormitory-based bible study. I had a disciple of my own, and was responsible for planning the curriculum and topics for some of the weekly bible studies in addition to leading the discussions.\n\n###The Holy Spirit\n\nIn spite of the spiritual example I was setting for the younger men, I was nagged by doubt. Were all student leaders as bothered as I was, but just better at hiding it? One Friday night, I was standing up in a huge lecture hall packed with hundreds of Christians worshiping God. I looked around, and observed the closed eyes, raised hands, and emotional expressions on faces. It was nothing surprising. I had felt that same Holy Spirit myself dozens of times, often encouraged by the people around me and the heartfelt lyrics to expertly composed contemporary worship music. These people weren’t faking it, I knew from experience those feelings were real. But for some reason on this night, I was also aware of the Muslims 6,000 miles away feeling the same spiritual transcendence as I was. It was probably the same feeling felt by whirling dervishes attempting to achieve religions ecstasy in 12 century Turkey, and Native Americans dancing around a fire worshipping their own gods. Even today as an atheist I get the same feelings packed in a crowd at an electronic music concert (especially when helped by some chemical substances). Although the commonalities between these experiences could certainly be explained by a universal god who related to people of all religions in their own way, it did not jive with the God of my religion. The Christian God, the true God, who has no personal relationship with anyone but the born again Christian who had surrendered their life to Jesus Christ and acknowledged him as savior. The Holy Spirit was supposed to be a gift only to born-again Christians.\n\nThis moment in the worship service made me realize that the shared spiritual experiences of people from all religions means either my god was much more universal than I had ever been taught to believe (with whom people of all religions could have a relationship) or that he did not exist.  I didn’t have an answer at that time, but the doubt was a seed in my mind that continued to grow.\n\n###The Old Testament\n\nMy desire to understand the true nature of our universe (always looking for evidence of the way things are) led me to regularly attend a monthly youth gathering entitled “Science and Faith” at a local church led by Marge, a physics professor at my University. The purpose of this gathering was to explore the alignment between science and faith, particularly faith in the inspired word of God in the Old Testament. Most of the discussions revolved around interpretations of the stories in Genesis that could be fit to our modern understanding of the history of the Universe. Here was a brilliant Christian woman who really cared about the truth. No hand waving would do for her, no “Who knows how old the earth is? Leave that up to God!” Instead, she offered seemingly reasonable metaphorical interpretations of the Genesis story, and explanations of how the “6 days of creation” could be matched up with what we now know happened in the formation of the earth over billions of years. For example, it actually made sense that light was visible on earth (day 1 in Genesis) before the sun, moon and stars were created (on day 4) because of the opacity of the atmosphere. Only after plants appeared (day 3), did the atmosphere begin to change enough to allow vision of the sun! See, it all makes sense! \n\nI don’t remember if this really every appeased my doubts.  Looking back, it really feels like a strange hybrid of two concepts: Admitting that the stories are mythical, only designed to teach some spiritual truth about the nature of god in language that the target audience could understand, while still trying to advocate that the stories contain some truth about the real sequence of events that formed our modern planet. It reminds me of attempting to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nI imagine with some trial, most of the mythical creation stories in various religions could be “re-interpreted” to match what we know about the big bang and the cooling of the lump of rock we call home. Let’s try it:\n\n&gt;The Cherokee creation belief begins with a water-covered earth. The first dry ground appears, brought up from the depths by a beetle. Birds flew to the earth, looking to see if it was ready for habitation, but the mud was still wet (this is exactly like the still cooling molten earth!), and not suitable. The tired birds’ wings dipped and dragged along the soft mud, creating mountains and valleys in the smooth surface (this represents the beginning of plate tectonics as the earth cooled).  Once the earth dried, it was inhabited by the animals, but the sun was so hot that it scorched the animals. (this matches perfectly with our modern understanding of the global temperature during most of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras!). In fact, this is the reason the red crawfish is red!\n\nSee how well the Cherokee myth fits with what actually happened if we allow ourselves some interpretive flexibility? It must be true! Does the fact that one can interpret a creation myth to align with the true order events really give any credibility to claims that the creation myth was divinely inspired?\n\nI don’t remember what Marge’s interpretation of Noah’s Ark was (although I know her interpretation of the flood in general was that there was probably an extremely severe local flood in or around Mesopotamia that grew in legend as time went on), but I often find many Christians attempting to provide rational explanations for Noah’s ark: \n\n* Most of the animals would have hibernated, so they would not require much food or space\n* Only a pair of animals representative of each genus would be necessary, as the individual species could arrive later through variation (Really? What ridiculous switching of sides we have here: The creationists claim that zebras and horses could diverge from a common ancestor in 6,000 years, while we really know that this took over 50 million years. The irony is unbearable)\n* Surely if the dinosaurs were babies they could fit into the ark, right?\n\n\nMarge also described potential natural causes for each of the plagues in the story of Moses and the slavery of the Israelites in Egypt (a century long enslavement and desert wandering of over nation numbering in the millions for which there is not much archaeological evidence). I remember something about certain natural events (mineralogical or microbiological) that may cause the Nile river to turn red and *appear* like blood. \n\nAll of this rationalizing is a funny reversal of the familiar “God in the Gaps,” practice of explaining misunderstood phenomena by claiming divine intervention or supernatural causes. Before the discovery of Newton’s laws, it was God’s active hand that guided the heavenly bodies. Before the germ theory of disease, we had evil spirits which caused sickness. Most Christians now concede these example to natural causes. In these “Science and Faith” discussions, we were doing the reverse: Figuring out ways to force-fit science and naturalistic explanations into the metaphors and myths in the Old Testament. \n\nIt now makes sense to me why this had to be done: The divine authorship of the Bible was one of the key cards holding up the tower of my faith.  If the tower were to stand strong, the Bible must have been inspired by God, and an all-knowing god surely wouldn’t put crazy, unrealistic stories in the Bible. Surely the stories match up in some way with how the universe actually came about?\n\nAlthough it was not yet obvious to me, the card tower of faith began cascading down in slow motion. Instead of going to CRU meetings, I gradually found better things to do with my Friday nights. My transition out of the religious community on Purdue’s campus was easy, as I had a large group of secular friends that quickly distracted me from any sense of loss. Thankfully my Christian friends never ostracized me, we continued to spend time together and enjoy each others’ company, although I don’t think we ever really discussed my lackluster attitude to the Christian Community (Now that I think about it, I am really surprised at the absence of attempts to understand my mindset or “bring me back into the fold”). The dorm small group was now in the capable hands of new spiritual leaders in the class below me. \n\n###The concept of Sin\n\nThe next card to fall was the entire concept of sin. The concepts that all sins are equal in god’s eyes (a single one is enough to doom you to hell), or even that all actions and thoughts clearly fall into one of two buckets: **sin** or **not-sin** started to seem crazy to me. It was all black and white, no gradient, no grey area. Surely it must be some sort of continuum containing things God loves, things he doesn’t care much about one way or another, things that bother him, and things he really hates? This led to an interesting question: did the almighty, immoveable god of the universe *really* care if I had premarital sex? What really “counted” as marriage anyways? Didn’t the kings in the old testament have multiple wives? Were they sinning? \n\nPreviously, the center of all my romantic relationships was an even more important relationship: the one between God and me. With the “sin” card gone, or at least not taken very seriously, I could now explore how to relate with a woman without the fear that someone was sitting in the sky watching me. I don’t think I was a very good partner in the the particular relationship I happened to be in in the time I was tackling these questions, but it was an interesting learning experience for me. \n\nSometimes I still think about the middle-school church talks we got about sexual abstinence. I remember one during which I vowed not to break God’s heart by ruining his purpose for my life by throwing away my virginity before marriage. The speaker certainly made me *want* to keep that promise, with all the well intentioned facts about the evils of pre-marital sex and pornography. I learned how having sex with three different people in my life was like having sex with a million, if each of those three had sex with three more, and each of those with three more, *ad infinitum*. I learned how looking at pornography would ruin my future sex life with my wife (could the opposite be true?). Anyways, no *real* woman look like the woman in those pictures! (Maybe the speaker just had an ugly wife?) \n\nWhat was left holding up my card tower? I lost belief in the power of prayer, in the absolutism of sin, certainly in the reliability of the Old Testament. Reliability of the new testament was shaky. The top of the card tower remained upright, suspended by an invisible line. There were few cards holding it up. I had to still believe in the saving grace of Jesus Christ. The other issues were doctrinal disputes. But if I ever lost the belief in the deity or resurrection of Christ, that would really be the end. I would no longer be a Christian. \n\nThat card didn’t have a specific removal date. But sometime between 2009 and 2011, equipped with knowledge  of evolution, the history of the Bible, and arguments by Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins, I took a furtive glance back and noticed that tower was no longer there. No cards were left. I was an atheist. \n\nWhen I was a Christian, every new thing I learned about science and the way the world works only served to *weaken my worldview*, to sow additional doubt. It somehow had to be rationalized, or jerry-rigged to fit the framework I operated under. Sometimes it was just ignored. I see this in other Christians: “You know, I’m just not sure how it all happened. That’s ok, I trust God”. Now, as an atheist, whenever I learn anything about our universe, it *strengthens* my new world view, and as such it’s fostered a new passion for learning about this world. I no longer have a mini-existential crisis every time I read a book or learn something new about genetics or archaeology!\n\n# Looking Back\n\nThe atheist community online is sometimes criticized for being hateful. Many people truly feel scarred and mislead, emotionally or even physically abused by the people they looked up to as Christians. They describe the hypocrisy of the Christian people in their lives, holier-than-thou attitudes by people with who preached Jesus’ love but didn’t display it. This couldn’t be farther from my experience.  I look back with fondness at the godly people of my life: Teachers and older kids at my Christian high school, My mentors in CRU. These people genuinely cared about me as much as anyone else in my life. Plus, we didn’t just sit around talking about God and praying. We threw sober dance parties, went on adventures in the woods, jumped in lakes in November. In fact, I have a slight twinge of nostalgia as I look back on this time. Not because of the beliefs or the relationship with God, but because of the deep and genuine relationships with the people. It’s amazing what deep and shared common beliefs can do to draw people together. Maybe that’s one reason religion is so prevalent throughout the world? \n\nC.S. Lewis once said “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.” At one point, that rung so true to me. Now however, I see that evolution (biological or social) doesn’t care about producing minds that have an accurate understanding of the world. If religion helps societies survive, it will pervade regardless of its truth. More fundamentally, if insatiability is a trait that causes creatures like us to innovate, explore, and create, it will most certainly be selected for. This by no means indicates that there must be something in an afterlife that finally satisfies all of our desires. \n\nMy life now is amazing and full of fulfilling, secular relationships. But even if it weren’t, I wouldn’t go back to Christianity just because I miss the experience, community, and the relationships within the church. In fact, I *couldn’t* go back just for those reasons as long as my rational brain knows the truth. Remember, I don’t choose my beliefs, my worldview. My worldview is a result of my knowledge, my understanding of the world. Going back to Christianity is as foreign an idea to me as becoming a Muslim or a flat-earther. \n\n",

        "text": "Let me first start with that I was always very critical with what I got taught by elders or teachers when I was young. And so I became a very harsh atheist by nature, who thought that the bible is only there for simple people to have a ordered view on the universe and dont get insane with thinking about it.\n\nBut as I more and more went into science and the beauty of explaining nature, I very fast understood that we think we know so much. But at the end we know so little till now.\n\nSo I was wondering how I can be so hardcore about there being no god, when in fact that hardcore thinking about the existence of a creator was the most disturbing thinking for me in the first place? Because for me in the end the answer is we just dont know yet. So I cant believe in the existence of a god but I also cant be certain about there being no god till proven otherwise.\n\nI still love being a atheist personally (even if I am not sure I am still one) because for me it always personally meant being open minded and not judging peoples thoughts without facts.\n\nThe most disturbing thing for me is when I hear from my friends or even here on this subreddit cheap shots against christians (they are also humans). Like when I hear/read some comparisons like :\"Believing in god is like believing in Santa/the Tooth Fairy \". From my rational point of thinking its the same insult hidden in semi facts that religious people do to attack atheists. Because first of all we dont know the (non)existence of both for certain (with fairy tale figures way more proven non existent on one hand. Smaller ground of possible existence etc.) And also one being the not very possible answer to existence. And the others a possible answer were kids get their gifts/money from at special occasions.\n\nIt just saddens me to see my believe being used to insult people who think different in a ,in my eyes, very cheap manner. That I only knew from believers in the past. \n\nDoes this make me no atheist any longer if I think that way?\n\n(I am no natural speaker so please no blame for bad spelling)",

The only places not dominated by Abrahamic faiths are Japan and China (although China has a growing Christian minority and a Turkik native Muslim minority).

Though eventually what brings me back to belief is that, even though I think it might be untrue at times, it's great enough in my opinion that I *want* it to be true anyway.\n\nAm I making any sense? Since I am assuming most of you here are atheists, have any you gotten to the point where you no longer believe but you like something enough that you practice it anyway?

As I walked out of the class I was facing the front of the room. I see on the whiteboard “evolution” then under it “theistic” and “atheistic.” I have known and worked with this person for several years and I was not surprised by this. He is an evangelical Christian, an old-earth creationist, and teaches anatomy. He’s rather conservative politically.\n\nIn the past, he had some conversion therapy garbage on his website and I confronted him about this. Ultimately, he took it down when someone outside the college contacted the administration. Another example is when he emailed that he would be giving students extra credit for attending Ben Stein’s *Expelled*. I confronted him on this and he said he believes in evolution but he wanted to give students another perspective. He is not a disagreeable person, just your Ned Flanders kind of happy-go-lucky person. I have heard from other students that he has spoken about abortion in the classroom. He would not push things to a point where he would get in trouble with the law, but he seems to border a lot because students don’t typically question him--either they agree or don’t want to rock the boat. \n\nGeographically, we are not in the south, but this area is somewhat conservative. The college administration is always fearing liability, so they probably do not want this happening in the classroom. I personally believe that I should confront him about it rather than report him. Sometimes he does act like a crusader on these, but we have never really battled. Let me know of any insight you have.\n",

If God can \"cause\" any event at any time, then there isn't really any strict causality in the universe, and the principle that whatever begins to exist has a cause loses its force and utility.\n\nWhat do you think?",

It was my first exposure to the baffling world of academic Christian apologetics.  Just a mind numbing mish-mash of nonsense hidden behind layers of confusing and contradictory jargon.\n\nAnyway, in the end all of these arguments end up confirming (lol) that God can indeed do something contradictory and illogical.  So I like to turn this argument around and use it to debunk their arguments about the existence of evil.\n\nIf God can indeed create a rock so heavy he couldn't lift it (i.e. perform an impossible, illogical, contradictory action), then he could also do the same when it comes to evil.  A lot of these arguments are based around free will, i.e. God must allow evil in order to give us free will.  Well, if you grant the rock argument then I would argue that God could indeed create a universe with no evil and also free will.  God is no longer bound by logic, so even if you think evil is necessary for free will, you've already admitted God is not bound by any set of logical rules.  Basically:\n\n1) God can create a rock so heavy he cannot lift it.\n\n2) God can create a universe with no evil but also with free will.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "We've been seeing a lot of statistics of various sorts over the past few years which purport to show a decline in religious belief.  I've been noticing that the terms used in these results are vague and/or undefined.  \n\nFor example, the term \"atheist\" seems to be used less and less in such polling, whereas the term \"unaffiliated\" seems to be cropping up more and more.  \n\nTo me, \"unaffiliated\" merely means that someone isn't an official member of an established church community, and don't attend a particular church regularly if at all.  I'm sure there are a lot of Christians that would be considered unaffiliated by that definition, and might even describe themselves as such - especially if the term isn't defined, or the question is phrased in a way that responding \"Christian\" implies church membership or attendance.\n\nIs anyone aware of recent surveys or studies which attempt to address this ambiguity, and distinguish clearly between actual atheists/agnostics and the merely inactive or unaffiliated?\n\nIt would be nice to have such data as a lower-bound number for the non-believing community...\n\nUPDATE: Somebody linked to [this article](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/5-homosexuality-gender-and-religion/) which is a good example of the sorts of well-defined study I'm talking about. On one hand, we see that the percentage of people who think that it is not necessary to believe in God to be moral is going up.  On the other hand, we read that \"Among those who do not affiliate with a religion, 89% think religion and government policy should be kept separate.\"  So this shows that at least 11% of the \"unaffiliated\" don't even think religion and government should be kept separate, which suggests that they may be theist and want some sort of Judeo-Christian gloss on government, even while remaining unaffiliated.

It might be to solve an overwhelming insecurity. It might be to solve financial problems. It might be to help that person raise kids or to take care of an elderly parent.\n\nI just left a six year relationship. My gf was very intent on us getting married; I was indifferent. It was clear she was trying to solve some of the problems mentioned above. But the fact that she wasn't solving her own problems ultimately forced me out.\n\nMy atheist friends used to question me, \"Why do you want to get married again?\", and I honestly couldn't answer them.

        "text": "I hope this is the right place to be posting this but, I've been struggling a bit with being an atheist. In many ways I never really made a choice to be atheist but rather I felt like I grew out of religion. The vast majority of experiences I had with religion as a child were very good. I went to a rather progressive church and was very involved. I sang in the choir I went to bible study I did every vacation bible school and had lead roles in plays and music performances. My priest would seem to speak more about being a good person than having faith in god outright. Faith seemed like a relatively good thing, it helped you become a better person. \n\nWhen I got a little bit older my parents got a divorce and I started living with her. She didnt really want to go to the church she went to with my dad because all his extended family went there. We shopped around for other churches around the same time but never found a good fit. My grandma began to take me to church and youth group for a time but I began to enjoy it less and less. As I actually studied specific aspects of the bible some of it seemed pretty implausible. The whole thing just began to fall apart in my head logically. It didnt help that at the same time I was realizing that I was gay. While my church was progressive, many of the church goers at the church were not progressive (including my grandparents). They were very vocal about the sin of homosexuality. A combination of these factors pushed me away from faith. \n\nFor a long time I was very indifferent to the idea of faith. I didn't believe in god not as some moral precept but just because it didn't add up to me. I never cared much if other people believed or didn't believe, so long as religion has a positive impact on your life go ahead and be a part of it. Because I really did fall out of religion slowly and didnt have a come to atheism moment I often reflected on how I got to the point of being an atheist. Occasionally I would get the urge to read the bible, not as some manna from heaven but because many people in my life were still religious and would share verses or stories and I thought they were interesting. God wasn't realistic and the bible wasn't always right but sometimes it had a useful moral tale or a nice psalm that had a very peaceful quality to it. I wasn't faithful but I saw the value of faith. \n\nJust recently I hit a rough patch in my life with my mental health. I had been struggling a lot with depression and anxiety. I started taking meds and seeing a therapist and things are leveling out a little bit. That being said, one of the things my therapist asked me to do was make my own place. A place in my mind where I feel safe and happy. I started trying to search for that place in my mind and I almost instantly went to religious iconography. It was almost scary. The worst part is despite my attempt to feel like I was in a safe place, my mind almost instantly went into feeling guilty and shameful about being gay. It felt as thought there was a place of peace and tranquility for me but only if  I gave up on being gay (which trust me I understand this is ridiculous but in this state of deep meditation it really effected me to linger on that for a bit). \n\nSo does anyone else here miss having a religion for some reason? Does anyone else wish they could get the benefits they felt from faith without having to do the mental gymnastics the faithful do? What do you do when you feel a strange call towards religion even though you know rationally it makes no sense. Does anyone who's an atheist still take comfort in religious symbolism? The whole deep meditation thing really messed me up for a bit, but I think it's good I did it because clearly I have some deep seated issues with my past faith and my sexuality.\nSorry for making this long, thanks for any help you can give. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/73wln3/some_of_the_issues_surrounding_islam_in_the_uk/",
        "text": "Hey folks,\n\nThis is a piece I'd written for my blog, I think if I were to link to my blog on its own this probably wouldn't be allowed, so I've included the article here. If you'd like to see more of my writing, I'd be happy to provide a link (if that's allowed! :) )\n\n---\n\nI’ve tried writing this several times, once about the perils of multiculturalism and once again about the compatibility of Islam and democracy, when truth be told, once I stripped away the meandering introductions all it really boiled down to was an articulation of my distaste for Islam. Now that that’s out in the open, I’m sure the cries of Islamophobe will come rolling in – which is one of the reasons I’m not too keen on this religion of peace. (That would be the same religion of peace that is currently engaged in internal civil war, with Shia and Suuni factions bitterly opposing one another)\n\nThis is something that should really go without saying, but I feel the need to preemptively defend myself – I don’t hate or dislike Muslims, it’s the ideology I have a problem with. To coin a phrase, I’m hating the sin and not the sinner. While I’m at it, I should point, in the interests of fairness, I have no great love for Christianity, much less any organised religion. But here I am, talking about Islam and not Christianity, because today Christianity is like a muzzled dog, there’s no bite.\n\nThis a difficult topic to discuss because any concern or critique is immediately seized by the twin hands of Islamophobia &amp;amp; Racism, and the life is throttled out of the discussion before it’s began. (Much in the same way any criticism of Israel is immediately anti-Semitic). Strangely, it’s usually those on the left that are quick to toss around labels, the very same people who are normally guardians of ideas like feminism, equality, and gay rights. But there’s a danger to shutting down debate, if valid concerns are ignored, if people are derided as racist or Islamophobic, their views are driven underground, If people are pressured into silence, then in the end it is unsavoury groups on the far right that champion the cause. Do not underestimate how many voters are single issue voters.\n\nIf we take a memetic1 approach to religion then its function is to replicate and survive, and in order to do that it must contain a set of processes which allow it to remain intact, or adapt. One of the ways a religion can secure its future is by preventing criticism, in other words, it has defence against environmental threats. This manifests as a belief that holy texts are divine revelation - the true, infallible word of god; it is therefore perfect and to question it would be to criticise god himself. This memetic trick is quite clever, it presents claim and evidence as one entity – this knowledge comes straight from god, god has given you this knowledge, therefore it is true. The memetic defence can go a step further by dictating punishments for those who do question or criticise its authority, acting as a deterrent to would be blasphemers and punishing the inquisitive souls who raise uncomfortable questions.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions have a rich tradition of punishing those who blaspheme, yet there is only one which continues to do so, both in the United Kingdom and the Middle East. Admittedly, in the UK the punishment is not delivered by the law courts as blasphemy laws were abolished in 2008, instead retribution comes from the public. Take the case of gymnast Louis Smith who drunkenly mocked Islam in a private video which was leaked; he was given a two month suspension and also received death threats for his actions. Imagine if this video had been mocking Christianity, it wouldn’t have made the news. This is how de facto blasphemy laws work, by creating such a social taboo around a subject that there is no need for the courts to intervene. The Church of England is the state church, and it wouldn’t dream of acting in such a manner, it respects the hard won ideals of the enlightenment - that no idea is above criticism, beyond reproach, or immune to mockery.\n\nIf practitioners of any faith wish to hold their belief system in such high esteem that they consider it unquestioningly perfect, fine, but do not expect non-believers to hold it to the same standard; nor should us heathens and kuffars be expected to self-censor for fear of offending believers - nor should we be expected to receive censorship for that which may provoke a reaction, e.g. the drawings of a prophet. Again, argue bad taste until you’re blue in the face, but the fact that a simple satirical cartoon can elicit such a violent and quite literally lethal response is unacceptable in the modern world. If you disagree with the violent response but in the very same breath qualify your disdain with “...but you know the reaction you would get”, you are an apologist. Let us not deflect – the real issue is not the drawing (no matter how offensive or in bad taste you declare it to be), but the reactions.\n\nThere’s also the small issue of the findings of a fairly recent ICM poll which suggested over half of Muslims think homosexuality should be illegal – which is a far cry from taking umbrage to the notion of same sex marriage. Now, I certainly don’t think a person is homophobic for having religiously based reservations on the topic (I do think their beliefs are homophobic). Wanting to criminalise my lifestyle on the other hand? A touch homophobic. In the interests of fairness, I did hear a Muslim say homosexuals were condemned only when they conducted their affairs in public, but keep it behind closed doors and it was all fine. Ah, yes, nothing like an entire life lived in total secrecy – because as soon as someone were to find out, either by mistake or wilfully, then it was over, time for condemnation and punishment.\n\nOf course, some would argue this is all down to interpretations of the text, that those who would profess such views are twisting the faith, are not true Muslims, just as those preaching literal (or ‘radical’) interpretations of the texts would level the same charge. It’s a simple logical fallacy, the ‘no true Scotsman’. Open to interpretations or not, the fact is, the texts offer justifications for the actions in the minds of adherents.\n\nAnd yes dear reader, I’m perfectly aware that ‘Not all Muslims...’ - I’m perfectly aware there are moderate Muslims who do not think or react in the ways mentioned above, but then clearly we’re not talking about that denomination of the faith. (I thought we were supposed to mock Not all x responses? Or is that only when it comes to men and white folk?)\n\nWhen it’s stripped away, and I’m being honest, I resent the pedestal Islam is put upon – I dislike the social taboo surrounding criticism of the religion, the violent reactions to satirical cartoons, and the apologetic responses from non-believers to those attacks. I dislike the fact non-believers constantly proclaim Islam as ‘a great faith’ - if it’s so great why aren’t you apart of it? These are things afforded to no other section of society, it elevates an imported religion above the church of the state, and we are forced to capitulate to it, to surrender our right to freely criticise and mock in order to keep the peace and not offend anyone. We spent too long winning freedoms from one religion to simply surrender them to another.\n\nA few years ago there was an outcry about Halal meat sold in high-street restaurants and big-name supermarkets without being labelled as such. The idea of the packaging remaining unlabelled is curious – if you are trying to attract faith-conscious shoppers, why skip the label? Unless you think the label will put off more people that it would attract? So then what is the purpose? One can only assume it has something to do with the logistics of the supply chain - buying a Halal meat, selling a portion in unlabelled packages, and marketing the remainder as Halal. As a former vegetarian I never accepted the argument against Halal on animal welfare grounds, most Halal meat is stunned before the blood is drained, just as typically slaughtered animals are stunned (although there still remains a small percentage where this is not the case). What is of concern are those members of the public who hold religious views and are unknowingly eating Halal meat; for some, eating meat that has been blessed in the name of another god is idolatrous – and if we are now in the business of respecting all faiths, then it would be unethical for such meat to remain unlabelled.\n\nWe laugh at other traditions, but we’re commanded to revere Islam, which, just as many other religions do, has precepts so fantastic, every rational person should pause for thought – child brides, winged horses, and splitting the moon in two. There’s also the wholly voluntary practice of women not at all being forced to cover their hair, face, or entire body – because they should be modest - lest they stir up (apparently) uncontrollable urges in men, which then...victims blames. (If the woman was modest she wouldn’t have been raped!) I suppose in that sense modern feminism and ancient Islam are compatible, all men are rapists.\n\nThe lack of criticism allowed is a problem, it does a huge disservice to the modernisers and reformers within the Islamic community; members who are so very often on the front line of abuse. We need to make it clear that rational debate and criticism is allowed; that concerns about religious practices or extremism are not ‘Islamophobic’, and they’re certainly not hateful.\n\n1Memes are cultural units of expression which are analogous to genes. Ideas and practices which are repeated and replicated, transmitted across a population and down through generations. e.g. ear-rings as decorations",

We often discuss philosophy and religion regularly when we gather. Despite no one in the immediate family attending, for whatever reason, my 7 year old niece is sent off with her grandmother on the fathers side to a Catholic church bi-weekly. This child is smart, and loves to hear me talk about evolution, astronomy, and history. \n\nWhen ever I say something to the two matriarchs running the child's life, I'm told \"Let her decide for herself\". As if setting a child in a room full of adults who tell her deviating will cause eternal punishment isn't going to sway her opinion. Recently during one of our trips to a rural farm market she saw a fat rooster sitting in a pen and as the mature adult that I am, I began to heckle the bird with her. Upon the thing falling off its roost i said \"Behold child, the last of the dinosaurs!\" to which she replied something about them being dead. \n\nI explained how through adaptations they became avian. Noticeably, she seemed to be shy about evolution this time. Upon questioning I discovered someone in the church was teaching her, not just Catholicism but outright 6000yo Earth, Dinos on the ark, Creationism, which i wasnt aware was something Catholics did. \n\nI told her not to listen to what ever nut had said that stuff and after some jokes at the still anonymous persons intelligence she was back on board, however nothing shy of me attending the church and continually disillusioning the nonsense and fear tactics will keep the child rational. Does anyone have advice as how to reach the adults with a say in her raising, or even just to get her to understand why its nonsense? I worry.",

This study seeks to examine contributions from variables such as family dynamics, religious socialization during adolescence, quality of parent-child relationships, and peer influences on religion. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nA person is eligible to participate in this study if they meet three conditions:\n\n(1.) They must be a former believer (i.e. not always an atheist) \n(2.) They must be at least 18 years of age \n(3.) They must speak English fluently enough to understand and complete the survey\n\nThe survey is a maximum of 76 questions, and a minimum of 64 questions; depending on a person’s answers, some questions may or may not appear. On average, the survey should take 20 to 30 minutes to complete, although individuals may find that it takes them more or less time than this, again depending on their answers.\n\nThe link to the survey is here:\n\nhttps://columbia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3l6uixuio0ZrCkJ\n\nThe study is open to an international audience who meets our English language requirement. Because of this, we ask you to consider sending it to others who are eligible and might be interested.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "(If there is any misconception or mistake, please feel free to correct me.)\n\n[TL: DR: We can predict natural disasters and weather with science, hence we can prepare ourselves for them. And since these are acts of God, what's the point of praying or conducting rituals for safety and protection from Him?]\n\nGod (or nature if you prefer) has been busy going around wreaking havoc and making headlines around the world; we have a number of hurricanes, earthquakes, and a volcano is threatening to erupt in Bali, just to name a recent few.\n\nMeteorological science and services have come a long way with weather forecasting technology and techniques. Although weather forecasting may not be 100% accurate, at least we know when disasters will strike and that would give us adequate time to develop contingency plans. Since we have the information on when a disaster will strike, why pray and hope for a miracle when you know God is going to create an apocalypse in your country? (His plan, His will, if He wants you dead, why bother praying?)\n\nIn the pre-science era, it was the norm to have weather modification prayers or conducting rituals(rain dance, animal sacrifice and etc.) to appease and appeal to gods for favourable weather for agriculture, prevent natural disasters and so on. In modern times, when God creates drought, science will solve the problem with cloud-seeding. As science thrives to create solutions to combat various natural problems, what's the purpose of having faith in deities when the man can help himself?\n\n= Bizarre thought: \nGod sends a hurricane towards your country because He wants to test or punish you for...whatever the heck He is furious with. With meteorological forecasting,  you can minimize the loss of life and damage of property before and after the hurricane. It feels strange to see religious people thanking Him for protection or answering their prayers after any natural disaster has passed.\n\nSince God wants to wreak havoc, and His followers were able to ‘dodge’ death and destruction, it would make Him furious that they have outsmarted him with science.\n\n= Bizarre thought 2: \nDepends on which religion you are in and which country you abhor, you may rejoice when that country is devastated by a disaster (hurricane for example), but what does that mean if the same disaster strike on your country (hurricane suddenly moves toward you)? \n\nIf God ‘attacks’ that country but the majority of victims are your brothers and sisters in your religion, what does that signify?\n\n= Bizarre thought 3: \nIt is fine to assume that houses of worship would stand the test of disaster, because...well..these are places where your followers congregate, sing praises about and pray to you; makes little sense to destroy your favourite places built in your name, you know.\n\nBut if some of these buildings are destroyed, does that mean God is displeased with these architecture designs?\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I was raised in a Muslim country and even though my family isn't religious, thanks to my friends and teachers I was exposed to religion a lot. What I will write is targeted at Islam and Christianity especially.\n\n   There are a couple of smart tactics that religion is using and in my opinion this tactics are the main reason that religion is still so popular.\n\n- Heaven and Hell. Especially hell. If you read the Quran, there are A LOT verses about hell even more than heaven. It is described as the most awful place that  a human can devise. And it is freaking eternal! Here in my country Muslims almost always threaten disbelievers with hell. \"Join us or burn an eternity.\" We all know that fear is one of the strongest motivators. For instance even people who don't belieave in ghosts can be frightened when something is moving in dark. Same for religion. When some person start to rationally dismiss holy books just say him that he will burn in hell! And he will be kept in herd.  Fear is an emotion so strong, it can completely block rationality and reasoning.\n    Heaven is similar, but it uses hope as a motivator. It is basically telling people \"Look I know your life is awful but if you pray to god he will let you to heaven. Don't look at this succesfull people, they all will burn in hell. You just remain in herd and you will be blessed!\". It is basically a manipulation trick that is used to control masses. It is a wonderful trick if you are a rich person and want to keep the poor under control.False hopes are one of best manipulation tricks.\n\n\n- Children indoctorination. When you are a little child , your worldview starts to form. You take serious everything your parents tell you. If your parents told you about how science is wonderful , there is a good chance you will love science your entire life. If your parents told you that there is a book called Quran(or Bible), and if you don't believe in it a supernatural deity will send you to hell, well...  Chance are that you will be a brainwahed religious person. Even if you realize that religion is nonsense as an adult, that fear of hell that your parents teached you will remain with you for entire life. That explains why certain religion are popular in certain countries. Explanation is simple, if you are born in Muslim family, you are exposed to Islam and you will be Muslim. If you are born in Christian family there is a high chance that you will accept Jesus as savior.\n\n- Satan the deciever! If you said something bad about their religion or don't want to pray the answer is ready. You are being decieved by a supernatural being that wants you to suffer. If you convince a person that there is a being out there that intentionally decieves people to make them suffer in hell, you can control that person. That person will feel guilty and weak when he does something wrong according to religion. And it will motivate him to be in herd and live his life accoring to a set of rules. For instance he will feel like he gained a victory against Satan when he prayed or avoided a sin. \n\n- Holy books are written in a such manner that it is posible to derive many interpretation from its verses. Especially original Quran is in Arabic and Arabic is a very complex language that is open to different points of view. Because of that holy books are practically disprovable. If you show a verse to a scholar and say \"This contradicts science!\" he will say that you interpreted it in a wrong way and if you actually look it from a different angle it is a sceintific miracle! If in holy books there were clear statements that are clear to any human being, then it would be easily disprovable.But verse are very poetic in their nature and you can see everyting in them if you want. It is similar to Nostradamus prophecies. They can be interpreted as ANYTHİNG. \n\n- \"Our religion is the only truth!\". All religions claim this.  It makes people who follow a certain religion to feel \"special\". It is a well known physological trick that is used in ads. The point of ads is convince you that you will be special if you buy their product. Same  for religion. \"If you convert to our religion, you are blessed with the truth!\". Also religion says that that people of other religions have their heart \"closed\". It is enough to make religious people feel good about their faith.\n\n",

        "text": "I was readingabout bible prophecys and I came across a site that was focused around the prophecys of Israel. I had a quick read through it and there was only 1 that confused me. (The others are easily explained)\n\n\"Ezekiel predicted when Israel would be re-established\n\nBible passage: Ezekiel 4:3-6\nWritten: between 593-571 BC\nFulfilled: 1948\n\nIn Ezekiel 4:3-6, the prophet said the Jews, who had lost control of their homeland, would be punished for 430 years. This prophecy, according to Bible scholar Grant Jeffrey, pinpointed the 1948 rebirth of Israel. Here’s a summary of Jeffrey’s theory:\n\n    Ezekiel said the Jews were to be punished for 430 years because they had turned away from God. As part of the punishment, the Jews lost control of their homeland to Babylon. Many Jews were taken as captives to Babylon.\n\n    Babylon was later conquered by Cyrus in 539 BC. Cyrus allowed the Jews to leave Babylon and to return to their homeland. But, only a small number returned. The return had taken place sometime around 536 BC, about 70 years after Judah lost independence to Babylon.\n\n    Because most of the exiles chose to stay in pagan Babylon rather than return to the Holy Land, the remaining 360 years of their punishment was multiplied by 7. The reason is explained in Bible’s book of Leviticus. (Leviticus 26:18, Leviticus 26:21, Leviticus 26:24 and Leviticus 26:28). In Leviticus, it says that if the people did not repent while being punished, the punishment would be multiplied by 7. And, by staying in pagan Babylon, most exiles were refusing to repent.\n\n    So, if you take the remaining 360 years of punishment and multiply by 7, you get 2,520 years. But, Jeffrey says those years are based on an ancient 360-day lunar calendar. If those years are adjusted to the modern solar calendar, the result is 2,484 years.\n\n    And, there were exactly 2,484 years from 536 BC to 1948, which is the year that Israel regained independence.\"\n\nCopied from the website: http://www.watchmanbiblestudy.com/Articles/1948PropheciesFulfilled.html\n\nCan anyone explain this? Because I can't come up with anything.\n\n(Sorry for the shit formatting I don't know how to do it properly)\n\n",

        "text": "I am posting this to correct the error made by most atheists who responded to the thread asking whether \"God does not exist\" is a claim. It is not, as I will show.\n\nThere are two ways of denying a claim:\n\n1. Deny it categorically, by making a knowledge claim. For example, \"there are no square circles\" categorically denies the existence of square circles. Again, \"no one is immortal\" categorically denies the existence of immortal human beings (at present, at least).\n\n2. Deny it within the current context of evidence, without making a knowledge claim. A claim in this category denies only that the claim is true relative to the current context of evidence. An example of a claim in this category is \"there are no unicorns.\"\n\nThis distinction is, although valid for most purposes, somewhat subjective. Since all we have to go by on any issue is our total evidence, a categorical denial will eventually reduce to a denial relative to some context of evidence.\n\n\"God does not exist\" means only that within the context of our current evidence, nothing entails or suggests that there is a God. It is a denial relative to our evidence, like \"there are no unicorns,\" not categorically.\n\nSo the take home lesson here is: Don't be confused by the superficial *appearance* of a claim, pay attention only to its actual intended *content*.",

My point in this thread is that it would benefit atheism if there were something equivalent to Christian apologetics, but devoted to defending atheism - that is, a number of people whose full time job was to research, produce, and promulgate the strongest possible case for atheism. To my knowledge, this does not really exist.\n\nI mean, arguably the reason Craig wins so many debates is that his only job is to win debates. Someone like Dawkins has a lot of other responsibilities that occupy his time.

        "text": "I always hated when people are so set in their ways that they cannot conceive of a way that would change their minds on a given topic. All too often, religious people say that no amount of evidence can change their minds. Which is obviously dogmatic and intellectually infantile. \nThen I was wondering what would really convince me that a god (deism) or personal god (theism) exists if I were to state any criteria.\nWhich seems like an easy question on the surface; obviously if suddenly a voice (\"god\") started speaking to me in me head, or if I would see people levitate, or have visions(hallucinations) or premonitions, anything supernatural like that might be evidence for god and I'd have to acknowledge its existence. \nThen I thought more about it, and really, that is no good evidence at all, since I could have just become schizophrenic or drugged or being part of an experimental neuroexperiment. \nMy point is, I realized that there are no ultimate circumstances where it would be sufficient to just trust our senses or experiences; especially considering the advances in computational power and virtual reality, in a few decades it will be impossible to destinguish virtual reality from actual reality. (I think people are familiar with the simulation argument)\n\nSo I spun the thought further, let's assume we actually are in a simulated reality, what kind of question could one ask an appearing \"god\" figure (entity that claims to be god) inside your virtual reality to destinguish it from a mere simulation product (from potentionally a simulation created by a technically super-advances civilization)?\nAfter all, any technical achievement far exceeding our current understanding of science will be indestinguishable from magic; like a smartphone would look like magic to people from Victorian England, and an airplane would look godlike and be worshipped in ancient Mesopotamia.\nIn a simulation, everything we would be able to experience could be engineered by that advanced civilization, yet it would still not be proof of god or a supernatural world. It would just be advanced science messing with our brains. \n\nSo given all those framework circumstances, is there a way where one would doubtlessly (or at least credibly) assert the supernaturalness of gods? I mean, what would you ask? \n\nTL;DR If we cannot trust our senses, what would any god need to do/know to be convincing you of his supernatural existence? How could a super-advanced civilization not do/know the same thing? ",

His Christian friend, who happened to be his sister’s boyfriend, began preaching to him about Christianity.\n\nEver since he got back home, he has been actively attending church every weekend.\n\nAccording to his mother’s story, he began to show extreme aversion to his family's religious beliefs, rites, and figurines in the house, even going to the extent of saying that they are worshipping ghost and demons, and urging them to convert so they could go to the same heaven with him in the afterlife.\n\nHe constantly preaches about the ‘goodness’ of Christianity to them and praising God for granting him employment and everything in between. He would infuriate his parents despite their wish to be left alone in peace with their beliefs and rites. His parents expressed huge disappointment about how he has changed and are getting exhausted in arguing with him.\n\nCurrently, he is inviting his parents to witness his baptism, and I don't know what is their stance on it. Meanwhile, he has plans to ‘brainwash’ his sister (including me) to Christianity.\n\nThe question now is… should I intervene in the conflict? As much as I want to stand up for his family, I'm afraid that trying to talk some sense into him on respecting everyone's personal space would backfire very badly.\n\nBy the way, anyone who is familiar with Christian evangelism and indoctrination on potential new converts, care to shed light on what and how churches could make them hold such fundamentalist views?\n",

It seemed an odd thing to connect *secularism* with lack of patriotism and that comment has stuck with me. \n\nNow it's no secret that many religious in this country seem to view the Flag as a religious relic to be worshiped and cherished. I suspect that part of what he said had a point, though not the one he was thinking - 'secular teaching and media' don't hold the flag up as a holy object. That's pretty fair. Turns out, when you take the \"god\" part out of \"god and country,\" you start looking at things a little more practically, and a flag is just a symbol again. However, I suspect that there are plenty of atheists who are patriots, and plenty who aren't, and I'm curious how you've found a difference in your navigation of American Patriotism (capital letters and all) from your religious peers. \n\nIt's an odd country in that religion and patriotism are viewed as so interconnected, but there we are. \n\nSo I'm throwing the topic out there to get your thoughts on the subject. What does patriotism mean to you? Does the flag hold any special value? What would be your response to someone who implied that being 'secular' or not involving religion in things is less patriotic/American/etc. for it? ",

It's not something I often talk about though I do at times argue against tired religious ideals like rejection of Darwins Theory and at times they might be able to put together my lack of faith. \n\nI have family who say \"There is no way you can look at the earth and how perfect it is and not believe.\"\n\nFriends who I jokingly comment in response to some slight on my actions \"I'm a Godless asshole I have no morality\" that retort that I absolutely have a God I just don't accept him. \n\nI personally have no issue with personal faith and often avoid attacking people's faith more choosing to attack the dangerous ideas that they push because of their faith. Being an atheist though I think they have no ideas to attack so they attack the stance itself. \n\nI've heard things like \" science lies all the time\" which they can't understand is impossible. I can talk until I'm blue in the face about how a scientist might try to lie but the scientific method will reveal his lies if followed. \n\nIt's so frustrating that because of ideology we can't even move past their fairytale to discuss real ideas.

        "text": "Hello everyone.\nI want to share my opinion about danger of religious beliefs. I think most dangerous religions are Abrahamic religions. There are several aspects of religions that make them ideas  damaging humanity.\n\n- You can't question religion. You must accept the WHOLE set of ideas without doubt. For instance in Islam you cannot just accept God and beliave in Judgement Day, you must accept all mythologies and habits associated with Quran. You must beliave that there are angels, demons, miracles etc...  And you must do it because some people claim that this book is from God.\n\n- Religion takes your freedom away. Again it forces you to live your life accoring to a book. You must pray, you can't eat pork, you must wear hijab etc. You can't question it. Just do what is written in a book that has no evidence.\n\n- Religion manipulates fear of death.It loves to blackmail disbelievers. In Islam and Christianity if you leave religion they threaten to send you to hell. Let paraphrase the most common threat of religions: \"If you don't blindly accept  our holy book that has no evidence, God will send you to a hypothetical place called hell!\". This fear of hell is a main cause of believing in a religion. If you are a child and your parents told you about hell, it will be particularly hard for you to leave a religion.\n\n- It contradicts science. Religion is giving answers without asking questions. A rational mind cannot accept mythological claims of religion without evidence. Hence almost all scientists are either atheist or agnostic. People who claim their book Quran is full of scientific miracles, hasn't made any contribution to science. Through the history we learned that the truth can only be found using science not using some unproved mythological claims.\n\n- Religion tends to divide humankind. Of course there are people that respect other religions, but in general it stimulates wars and conflicts. Even in religion of Islam there are different sects that fight each other. People fight in the name of God, a hypothetical omnipotent being that has no proofs. ",

        "text": "I have been thinking about probability lately, and wondering if such a thing even exists. After all, isn't everything that happens just a result of all the physical processes and forces that act on it? If that is the case, isn't it true that every event that happens was \"destined\" to happen from the start? To me, these premises lend themselves to two conclusions:\n\n1. There is no such thing as free will, as our thoughts and behaviors are almost certainly an emergent property of the molecules and electrical impulses inside our brains and therefore subject to determinism.\n2. The universe is self-containing; therefore it is impossible for anything outside the universe to affect anything inside of it. Additionally, there is nothing in the universe that is not a part of space-time, and thus the idea of an \"extramaterial being\" is illogical. Even if anything extramaterial existed, it would not be able to interrupt the universe's determined course. As a result, there is likely no god, and even if there were, it would be unable to affect the course of the universe after its initial creation. \n\nTo me, these points seem very logical, but I'd like to be challenged on them, as I know these points are not universally agreed upon. I know that some Christians say determinism is compatible with the idea of an all-powerful god, but to me this makes no sense. I'd like to hear what you guys think about this.\n",

        "text": "I am sure this is not an original thought but I wanted to discuss it a little bit with this sub before I take it to r/debatereligion. I was thinking about one of the common responses to the evidentiary problem of evil: the \"Greater Good\" theodicy.  It seems to me that if taken to its logical conclusion, this theodicy would result in a reversal of what most people would consider moral behavior. I know this is not the only time religion can cause a reversal of what is considered moral behavior, but I hadn't thought of this one before.\n\nSo the \"Greater Good\" theodicy is the response that God allows evil to exist because it would allow some greater good to happen that wouldn't be possible without the existence of the \"smaller\" evil. This \"greater good\" is not usually specified, although the apologist might make an analogy to a parent punishing their child (Yes, I know the problems with the analogy, that isn't the point I want to discuss right now). \n\nBecause the god that the problem of evil is refuting is tri-omni, then the evil that exists must necessarily be the least amount of \"evil\" (however you would quantify that) that could achieve the greater good.\n\nLet's take an example of what we might call natural evil: disease. It can be any disease: Cancer, polio, influenza, etc. Most people would say these diseases are evil because they cause suffering and in many cases death. The \"Greater Good\" theodicy states that this suffering and death is necessary for God to achieve some greater good and that this is the minimum amount of suffering and death necessary to achieve this greater good (otherwise there would be needless suffering which would make God not omni-benevolent). Doesn't this mean (according to this worldview) that any attempts by doctors or medical researchers to limit the suffering of people with the disease, prevent the spread of the disease, and/or cure the disease are actually doing evil because they are preventing the \"greater good\" from occurring? I know that some sects believe something close to this (Christian Scientists, not to be confused with scientists who are Christians) but they are hardly in the mainstream.\n\nWouldn't this also apply to natural disasters such as Harvey? Wouldn't efforts to reduce suffering from the hurricane prevent the \"greater good\" from occurring because this theodicy presumes that God has reduced the suffering as much as he could without sacrificing the greater good?\n\nDoes a similar argument apply to the free will theodicy in that creating laws and sentences restricts free will which is seen as the greater good in this theodicy?",

He's an Elder there - in my denomination, on the level of a pastor - and still thinks that I'm a believing Christian. \n\n(Some background info on me. I'm 17, been in the church my whole life, was a hardcore Christian until I started doubting about a year ago. I was getting into philosophy and critical thinking and then ran into all sorts of problems when I tried to apply them to the Bible.)\n\n\nI was wondering if any of you had any advice or stories of how you left the church?\n My church is structured such a way that it is extremely heavy on church discipline and attendance, so when I graduate and leave home if I stop going to any church in my denomination, my church (and dad) will know.\nPeople have left before and it was a long and scary process of bringing elders to question them, rebuke them, bring them before the church and eventually excommunicate them. \nI don't want to just run away from my church and destroy whatever relationships I might have kept there, but on the other hand the idea of going through my church's whole session seems scary to me. \nDoes anyone else have any similar experiences with churches like this? \n\nEdit: \nThanks for all of your responses. I'll be playing the long game then until I'm out, I'd rather not destroy my relationship with my parents but if they're choosing \"god\" over their son then it's not worth it. \nOn the financial side of things, I have a job now and am saving. I'm planning on getting an apprenticeship as an electrician instead of college, so money for that won't be an obstacle. \nThanks again for all of your advice, hopefully everything will go well! I graduate in May, so not much longer at home. &lt;3 you guys",

If you haven't heard of it, in a nutshell it's an attempt at a revival of a  once hypothetical explanation for some solar phenomena that's been abandoned by the scientific community. Lots of psudo-science, flat-earth type stuff going on. \n\nHis interest in this seemed same as always - harmless wacky entertainment. Something different is going on with him this time. He's become religious. Apparently the deeper you get into the Electric Universe, they start getting very theological. I don't know exactly how they make those connections, but regardless, my brother has become infuriating. We were raised muslim, all of my siblings have been atheist for many years until now.

I know the flat-earther movement is doing something similar.

If you can read through those messages with all the bad grammar and spelling mistakes and still believe it - you're the type of person they want responding...\n\nWhat i mean to say is - if you're willing to bury yourself deep enough into these offbeat pseudo organizations - the next logical step is Christianity or whatever religion has co-opted it. \n\nCall me crazy.
