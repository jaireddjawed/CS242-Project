It is impossible to escape.\n\nMy understanding of Epicureanism is that I should cultivate a quiet, peaceful life within this totalitarian state, enjoying the company of my friends while accepting that I can’t change the social conditions. I can only do my best to live a pleasant life under these circumstances.\n\nNow let’s say that I am managing to live a pleasant, wholesome life despite the state of affairs in my country. But one day the government conscripts my services due to a sudden personnel change. I am being conscripted for one day only.\n\nI am tasked with assisting in the torture of political prisoners. My role would be to assist the torture specialist by holding down the prisoners, retrieving instruments, etc. I only need to assist with the torture for one 8 hour shift, after which I will be free to resume my life.\n\nIf I refuse to complete the job, I will be punished for refusing to do my “civic duty,” and I will be condemned to the same life of torture and pain as the prisoners.\n\nMy intuition is that the morally heroic thing to do is refuse to assist. But I see no room for this kind of sacrifice in an Epicurean framework. It seems that an Epicurean should do the minimum to assist the torture specialist for the 8 hours in order to safely return to his friends and his pleasures and to get past the whole distasteful experience. \n\nAm I mistaken in my understanding?",

The problem is, everyone has different necessities. Many of these that make people different are unnatural necessities. These we can eliminate from a society for the most part, like smoking. But what about unnatural necessities people are born with? People with disabilities have more necessities than normal people. These are inherently unnatural necessities, but they cannot be eliminated. Someone with social anxiety needs to be alone and a society cannot really accommodate this. Someone born with depression needs careful attention that a society cannot accommodate. People with allergies may be harder to accommodate certain necessities to. The list goes on. This makes a communist system have a much harder time providing ataraxia to everyone. But, more importantly, how do we classify these necessities that bring pleasure or  prevent pain that are unnatural but natural?",

        "text": "I was a by product of society telling me what I needed to do in order to be \"happy\" (the most vague and unhelpful word I have ever heard). These were excess of money, excess of sexual encounters and an abundance of \"stuff\". \n\nIn truth you don't need any of this to be happy, you don't need any of this to live as Epicurus told us (many others told us this as well such as eastern philosophers). When it comes down to it, after I have been fed, watered and am fairly cosy I am free to live a pleasurable life. \n\nI've had sex with 6 people this year, I respect these people greatly and have great feelings for them, however none of these turned into a friendship or love. I have to ask myself, was the choice of me sleeping with these people worth it? The short term pleasure was great and the feelings I felt in those moments were great but in the end the loss of these people caused more pain than the moments of pleasure. I would have rather had sex with 1 person and developed a deeper connection than 6.\n\nMoney is a joke, my father and my family grew up poor. My father was an army man and my mother (who was the best parent a person could ask for) wasn't working at the time. My father is now close to a millionaire (multiple shops selling E-Cig) the thing is, he is stuck in a misery/conditional happiness cycle. All the money can buy him big cars, tummy tucks and a 350000 euro house but he is still unhappy. \n\nI have 60 euro in my bank account, I have worn the same jeans for a week but I have good friends (including my dog) and I know what the true good is, I trust my body to tell me what is good and what is bad (pleasure and pain) and I apply reason to these pleasure and pains. \n\nI can honestly say, at this moment and from practicing Epicureanism for over a year, I have never been in a better place than I am now. I appreciate the gift of life and trust myself. It is true what Epicurus said, \"the Wise Man has nothing to fear from fortune\". \n\nThank you to this page, the Facebook Page and New Epicureanism.com for helping me on my journey. I hope we can continue to live free and philosophise with each other for many years to come.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm 31.  The first 27 years of my life was lead in almost total isolation, due to decisions my parents made in my upbringing and commitments in my adulthood that flowed from them.  No education, but more importantly for this post, no socialization.  Then, I made it to community college, and found that people... are wonderful.  Everyone I explained my situation to was sympathetic and supportive.  I was good with people, and people were good to me.  Friends come easy, and the ones I've made the deepest connections with have become... everything to me.  My heart and my soul.  Truly, my reason for life is my community of friends I have built.\n\nMy background set me up for a very deep appreciation of friendship, so deep that nobody around me could really understand, it seemed like.  No one was hostile or anything like that, but I know more introverts and misanthropes than extroverts and philanthropes.  But then, when I expressed an interest in philosophy to a friend (a physics major without a reason for his degree can be pretty existentially minded), he linked me to a cute little series on philosophy, [\"Philosophy: A Guide to Happiness\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVA8jX9KQcE&amp;list=PL7857933243B7D31B), 6-25 minute episodes, each focusing on a specific philosopher and something they specialized in.  The second episode is on Epicurus and Happiness, and in it they refer to his three necessities for happiness; an analyzed mind, freedom, and most important of all... friendship.  I did more research, and found this quote (among other translations):\n\n&gt;\"Of all the things that wisdom provides to help one live one’s entire life in happiness, the greatest by far is the possession of friendship.\" - Epicurus\n\nFrom across millennia, long after his life, a man knows me.  He understands the contents of my heart.  I have never had such a sensation.  And what's more, he could make reasoned arguments for these feelings, for not only their validity, but for their place as morality defined.  He knew me so well, he could help me tackle questions that my atheism could not readily provide peace for on its own.\n\nI feel as if I have found religion.  I have many friends of faith and how they always described what they like about their religion and what it feels like has many commonalities with what I now have.  I have now found that the philosophy of friendship and these kinds of human relationships is actually a pretty broadly researched subject, and in that, I believe philosophy as a whole is something I've been looking for for a very long time.\n\nI am very new to all of this, but the impact it has had on me is as deep as anything I've ever experienced.  What do you recommend I do?  Where can I find more?  How best can I explore this? Given what has struck such a chord with me, what should I research?\n\nedit: recommended reading aside, I've already procured most of it",

        "text": "Hey y'all, if you remember some months ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epicureanism/comments/6rtmy5/epicureanism_and_masculinity/) about the connection between Epicureanism and Masculinity. I had mentioned that most of the criticism of Epicurus from Stoics and Roman philosophers was more of seeing it as an 'effeminate' philosophy. Even if you take away the pleasure connection, the lack of exposure to 'vain' or 'unnecessary' risks in epicureanism as well as the comfortable nature of having a garden, friends, philosophy, and being content with this, is another angle from which to look at the effeminate criticism.\n\nIn any case, my feelings are that Epicurus was presenting a different kind of Masculinity. So basically this is how I feel masculinity evolved in the Greco-Roman era:\n\nWith Socrates/Plato, the idea of being masculine was to be rational (or prudent). As long as you did the regular things, managed yourself well, was not addicted to anything and of course was brave when necessary then yes you could be seen as masculine.\n\nWith Stoics, that evolved a bit to include being able to deal with pain, frustration, and being able to rise above that. Stoicism is also about discipline and gratitude, and realizing that time is precious, so making the most out of your time.\n\nWith Epicurus though, and I think this is how his philosophy ought to have developed, yes he focused on being prudent and rational and enjoying simple pleasures and knowing when to forgo pleasures etc etc, but the real value from his philosophy is that to be masculine involves being able to develop a style for oneself, and basically seeing your life as an art. The take away is life is to be enjoyed and to enjoy life, one must be true to oneself (everyone is unique so everyone can develop their own style). But then life must also be fashioned in a way to engage in life's pleasures but not at the expense of self-development. Life must be seen as an art, and pleasure could be part of life, if it is done well. Epicureanism is basically the art of enjoying pleasure.\n\nI remember folks responding to my last post saying: Epicureanism is gender neutral, gender is a spook etc etc. Masculinity here is gender neutral. Masculinity here is more about being the best version of yourself.",

        "text": "One of the limits of epicureanism is shown when you consider risk-taking. Epicurus has many sayings about judging pleasures by their long term consequences, likewise with pain. So for instance, if a pleasure has more pain associated with it in the long term, it is best to avoid that pleasure. Similarly if necessary pain had a more positive long term outlook, then embrace that short-term pain. All well and good.\n\nHowever, I feel epicureanism reaches its limits when it comes to risk taking. What I mean is, suppose you have to make a choice about the future, maybe a career choice, or a choice that determines how you want to live your life. Epicureanism doesn't give you any answers because Epicureanism is based on being able to a certain extent to predict the future. If the future is unknowable, like say the position of Adam and Eve right before they ate the fruit of life, then all pleasure seems good and all roads lead to heaven. In any case, I feel epicureanism is a bit based on reasoning and less on the heart, for epicureanism to matter in our lives, it needs to evolve from the position of just calculations in our heads, to faith or trusting or belief in our hearts.\n\nSo you, like Neo, in the matrix, have two choices. You can take the blue pill, wake up, life is good, less anxiety and less fears. Or you can take the red pill, and face the truth, but you will meet the reality of your fears and anxiety, and uncertainty and possibly danger. What do you take? Follow your head or your heart? ",

Health is something that requires \"care and effort\" (pain), but it is much better to do what we can to be healthy than to suffer from the lack of health. Good friends might at time cause us pain, but it is better to have them than not to have them. And finally, \"natural wealth\", the ability to provide for our daily needs, requires effort, but better this than to be suffering from abject poverty.",

        "text": "**The Canon of Truth:**\n\nEpicureans believe that Nature has giving humans senses in order to navigate the world. In the Canon of Epicureans, according to Lucretius, their exists three main ways for a human to navigate  the world which are: *The 5 Senses, Pleasure and Pain(called feelings) and Preconceptions*\n\nA practicing Epicurean unlike Stoics or Cynics will not rely purely on reason to navigate the world, instead they will use their 5 senses, pleasure and pain and preconceptions to find out the truth. This does not mean that they believe the senses have the answer or that they reason is useless. The thought that in order for reason to have some use it must be referred back to the Canon.\n\n**Pleasure and Pain as a Guide:**\n\nWhile pleasure is the highest good for an Epicurean, the goal of life for an Epicurean is life itself, pleasure and pain are the gifts giving to us by Nature in order to traverse life in order to live as we should.\n\nReason actually has a huge part to play here despite what people (like myself) think. Epicurus says that Prudence (sometimes called practical wisdom) is more valuable to a person than philosophy itself. Prudence allows us to choose between engaging a pleasure and avoiding a pain, it allows us to think about how a pleasure may lead to a pain(getting fucked up on a night out then dealing with the feeling of death the next day) or how accepting a pain can lead to a pleasure (exercise being the most obvious one for me). To an Epicurean a pleasure is always intrinsically good but pains can never be intrinsically good, only extrinsically.\n\n**Preconceptions:**\n\nPersonally I hope a senior member can help explain this, I don't have a good idea of what this is at all. It seems as if Epicurus believes that we are born with ideas already in our minds but I could be completely off the line.",

        "text": "Pretty slow around here lately. :) This is only slightly related but I thought you all might enjoy this little parable about the Cyrenaic philosopher Aristippus.\n\n---\n\nIt is related of the Socratic philosopher Aristippus that, being shipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast of the Rhodians, he observed geometrical figures drawn thereon, and cried out to his companions: \"Let us be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man.\" With that he made for the city of Rhodes, and went straight to the gymnasium. There he fell to discussing philosophical subjects, and presents were bestowed upon him, so that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those who accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life. When his companions wished to return to their country, and asked him what message he wished them to carry home, he bade them say this: that children ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that could swim with them even out of a shipwreck.\n\nThese are indeed the true supports of life, and neither Fortune's adverse gale, nor political revolution, nor ravages of war can do them any harm. Developing the same idea, Theophrastus, urging men to acquire learning rather than to put their trust in money, states the case thus: \"The man of learning is the only person in the world who is neither a stranger when in a foreign land, nor friendless when he has lost his intimates and relatives; on the contrary, he is a citizen of every country, and can fearlessly look down upon the troublesome accidents of fortune. But he who thinks himself entrenched in defences not of learning but of luck, moves in slippery paths, struggling through life unsteadily and insecurely.\"\n\nAnd Epicurus, in much the same way, says that the wise owe little to fortune; all that is greatest and essential is under the direction of the thinking power of the mind and the understanding.",

        "text": "**tl;dr:** Pleasant mind leads to pleasant social interactions.\n\n**'Recommended Book**\n\nStarting off, there is an entire book written about how your internal mood is one of the most important things in being sociable called \"[The Charisma Myth](https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947)\" by Olivia Fox Cabane, in it she has exercises such as visualizing yourself and making yourself feel the emotions you felt at a high point in your life, for instance when you won a competition or just had a good time with your mates. I read this book because I had to do a lot of presentation over a few weeks and it really helped.\n\n**Pleasure according to Epicureanism**\n\nIn Epicureanism there are two kinds of pleasure, these are Static and kinetic pleasure. In this post I will be discussing how static pleasure, specifically a pleasant mindset, has led me to be more sociable and confident. \n\nA static pleasure is simply a pleasure in which you don't have to take an action to achieve, this occurs when all your natural needs are met and you have dealt with any issues in your mind such as anxiety, these pleasures according to Epicureanism are the type of pleasures which we should aim for because they are the easiest to get and unlike kinetic pleasures they have no chance of leading you to pain.\nA kinetic pleasure on the other hand is where you have to perform an action to achieve a pleasure, such as eating a pizza. \n\n**Epicurus and Virtue?**\n\nSurprisngly when I was reading through Epicurus \"Principal Doctrines\" and \"On the nature of things\" I came to realize that Epicurus placed Virtue and wisdom very highly, he actually thought that you could not live a pleasant life without them. He really emphasized the importance of the use of the Virtue of Prudence/practical wisdom. \n \n**Example of how to use Wisdom:**\n*If you are familiar with CBT techniques and Stoic techniques you already know how to do this.*  \n\nWhen a nasty emotion pops up in our body, or a random jarring thought (known as Automatic Thoughts) one way to deal with them is to step back from taking the emotion personally and look at it objectively and literally ask the emotion \"is there some empirical and justifiable source of you\". You could also wait a few moments for the more intense emotions such as anger or lust and ask \"will going a long with this emotion lead to pleasure or pain?\".\n\n**Tranquility: The key to pleasure**\n\nOnce your necessary desires have been met and you mind is calmed what is left, according to Epicurus (and is true in my anecdotal experience) is a feeling of ease, mild pleasure and tranquility.  This type of pleasure is there constantly and is easy to maintain, I have managed to maintain tranquility in\"tense\" situations and even in situations where previously I would have been fuming and raging (digging a 20x12 foot hole and my should snapped in half because I hit a stone).\n\n**Social Side Effects**\n\nWhen I am in the aforementioned pleasurable mindset, I am much more at confident or rather *at ease* when I am talking to my friends and even doing presentations. I am no longer tight in my throat and chest or losing my breath doing presentations. When I am talking to friends, the mild pleasure that comes with tranquility turns into a moderate pleasure and the conversation starts to flow more fluidly. When before I would be trying to fill the gaps with a joke it just feels like a nice break in the conversations.\n\nIt also makes me enjoy listening to people more, before when people were speaking to me I would feel bored or just waiting for the moment where I can butt in and speak, now it feels good to focus on the other person and listen to what they are saying.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEpicureanism has really helped my life, it has many other side effects other than just social life but I just wanted to speak on it. I do hope that this sub can eventually change peoples beliefs about Epicureanism and see that it can be a valuable philosophy of life. \n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis is all my own anecdotal experience in my practice of Epicureanism, this philosophy may not be for everybody. Epicureanism and indeed every philosophy of life is supposed to be a broad guide and I do not claim that it has all the answers. \n\nAlso Epicureanism texts are all but gone but we are lucky to have Stoic texts, a lot of the techniques I use to calm my mind and achieve pleasure come from Stoicism and I still love Stoicism although I simply place pleasure above virtue (though virtue is necessary for long lasting pleasures).\n\n",

I'm only 21 now and have been sick for 4 years already. My doctor recommended I look into the Epicurean perspective of chronic illness/pain. I've been reading articles and primary texts all day, and have learned a lot about Epicureanism already. It really resonates with me already. \n\nHowever, I'm having trouble finding philosophies on chronic pain and suffering. Can anyone guide me to some essential Epicurean readings on this? I know Epicurus himself struggled with chronic illness, at least at the end of his life. Thank you so much in advance! ",

        "text": "So I am on the fence, fellas, and while I think this has been beaten like a dead horse in the road, I often wonder why people choose one (Stoicism or Epicureanism) over the other. \n\nI think that I am kind of with Nietzsche when it comes to the Stoics, particularly in 'Beyond Good and Evil' where he labels Stoicism as \"self-tyranny.\" The fatalism disturbs me. Yet I often feel that many people go toward Stoicism, not just for its \"warrior mentality,\" but because people see it as being more practical to everyday living. As much as I would love to retreat to my own garden, with my books and friends, the conditions in my life (home owning, as a husband, as a father) forces me to engage in the cosmopolis to make money. Do I wish to do this? No. Do I have to? Yeah. \n\nAnother thing I am on the fence with is the supernatural. I came from a very religious background, and even studied theology. However, my appreciation of competency as well as transparency caused me to leave organized religion. In the everyday world I think it is obvious that there isn't a deity that engages in the affairs of men. While the pantheism of the Stoics is something that I find mildly romantic, I fail to see the proof of it. \n\nAny one have thoughts on these subjects?",
