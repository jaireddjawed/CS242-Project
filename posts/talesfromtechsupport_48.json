        "author": "micheal65536",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7djxgj/the_eternal_disk_check/",
        "text": "First-time post. I do contract work for small business that want their computers fixed, or want someone that they can call straight away if they have a problem with their computer. One of my clients has a small office with only two staff, each with their own computer. I received this call from them yesterday.\n\nThe cast:\n\n* $Me - me\n* $UnderpaidManager - the guy at the top of the office, except that this role is currently vacant\n* $OverworkedAssistant - the assistant to $UnderpaidManager, who's currently filling in on most of $UnderpaidManager's jobs too\n\nNow before we begin I must tell you that $OverworkedAssistant is an unusual person for these kinds of stories. He's by far one of the most technologically incompetent people that I've worked with, but he's also one of the better kinds to work with. If you tell him to call you when there's a problem instead of trying to fix it himself, you can trust that he will. If he's clearly broken something then you will never tell him this to his face because he's simply too charming to tell off. If you tell him not to do something, then you know that he won't. Usually...\n\nFirst thing yesterday morning I get a call from $OverworkedAssistant that he just got into the office and his computer's doing a disk check and says that it will take an hour to complete. I tell him to not, under any circumstances, interrupt the disk check and that I'll call him back after an hour, figuring that by then it should be finished and I can take a look at some logs remotely to make sure that nothing more serious is going on (being a frustrated Windows user he often force reboots his computer, so I didn't think too much of the disk check).\n\nBefore I called him back, it occurred to me that the computers were supposed to have been left on the previous night to carry out a backup (the terrible backup system is another story). So when I called him back, I asked him if he'd remembered to leave the computers on and he said that yes he had and that $UnderpaidManager's computer was exactly as he had left it, but when he came back this morning his computer was doing the disk check. And it still hadn't finished the disk check.\n\nI figured to give it another hour, during which time I did a bit of background research on Windows disk checks. I found it *very* strange that the computer had spontaneously rebooted to do a disk check when it was supposed to be doing the backup, but I found out online that apparently if Windows encounters a disk error during use it will reboot and perform a disk check. So I figured that it must've encountered an error during the backup and then rebooted itself. Now things weren't looking so good, this wasn't just a normal \"dirty filesystem\" issue.\n\nI called $OverworkedAssistant again after an hour, confirmed that the computer was still doing the disk check, and told him that I'd be in the office in half an hour. I arrived at the office and, much to my relief, found that the computer was exactly as described and had not spontaneously resolved itself.\n\nBy this time it was clear to me that the disk check was never going to end and I was going to have to force reboot the computer. I had hoped that the disk activity LED would be off, as though the computer was sitting doing nothing, but it was on solid. At this point I had a growing suspicion that there was a serious error and the hard disk controller had locked up, which can cause the LED to remain on constantly. I hesitated with pressing the reset button on the front of the computer and instead got out my laptop to check if the backup onto the NAS drive had completed.\n\nIndeed I found that the backup from $UnderpaidManager's computer had completed, but the one from $OverworkedAssistant's computer was only partly complete. Now at this point I should mention that this client uses Windows Backup for their backups, something that I keep planning to change, and examining the files on the \"backup\" network share showed that the \"image backup\" from the previous night was at least partially complete but the \"files backup\" was entirely absent. Oh dear, this must mean that the hard disk encountered an error during the image backup and triggered Windows to reboot and perform a disk check, which then froze because of the same error occurring again.\n\nI went over to $OverworkedAssistant's computer again and pressed the reset button, booting it from my Linux USB stick. I checked the SMART information on his hard drive and I found not just a few bad sectors, but a few *hundred* relocated sectors, *and* a few hundred uncorrectable read errors *and* a few hundred write errors *and* a few hundred seek errors, pretty much a few hundred of every kind of error that could exist. The hard disk was clearly bad.\n\nNow here's the part about $OverworkedAssistant that I didn't tell you at the beginning, because I didn't want to spoil the story. Even though he's the perfect child at following instructions at other times, the one thing he never stopped doing is kicking his computer, no matter how many times I told him that that would break the hard disk and explained to him *why* it would break the hard disk. Not kicking it intentionally, mostly bumping it quite hard with his legs when he sits down or gets up, or changes position at his desk. I'd tried to find somewhere else to put the computer rather than right under the desk, but he was reluctant to move it as he wasn't aware of how much it was getting bumped and didn't quite take the risk as seriously as it was.\n\nSo now I'm trying to figure out how to a) break the news to the company that they will need to buy a new hard disk b) break the news to $OverworkedAssistant that his hard disk is faulty and he's going to be without his computer until I can get it fixed c) break the news to $OverworkedAssistant that he broke his computer even though I told him not to.\n\nAs I sat scrolling up and down the SMART info dump, I muttered repeatedly \"this is bad, this is very bad, oh dear, this is bad\" while trying to think what to say to $OverworkedAssistant who was sitting at $UnderpaidManager's computer trying to carry on with his work.\n\nJust at that moment, $OverworkedAssistant heard my muttering and spoke up in the most gentle and innocent voice ever:\n\n&gt; **$OverworkedAssistant:** Is it broken?  \n&gt; **$Me:** Yes.  \n&gt;\n&gt; *Then I thought for a moment, and got up and walked over to sit down at $UnderpaidManager's desk where I had set up my laptop, nearer to $OverworkedAssistant.*\n&gt;\n&gt; **$Me *(as softly as possible)*:** I'm afraid, this is what happens if you bump your computer. The hard disk's broken.  \n&gt; **$Me *(softly but firmly)*:** Now look, I'm going to have to replace that hard disk and I don't want this happening again. Can we try to find somewhere else to put the computer where you're not going to bump it without realising?  \n&gt; **$OverworkedAssistant *(innocently)*:** OK.  \n\nSo the good part is that he takes the risk seriously now. The bad part is that they used Windows Backup for their backups, which means that there's no way that I can recover them. If they were a normal disk image or file copy, I could just copy the image or the files onto the new hard disk. But they're in a proprietary format that only Windows itself can extract, not to mention that the backups are also inconsistent because they're performed while the system is running, so something could've been modified during the backup so I don't trust these backups anyway. The saving grace is that the users' files are all saved on the NAS drive.",

        "text": "Hello everyone.  I'm SF5k, a 15 year old sophomore who loves working with computers and other technology.\n\nI am the de facto tech support person in my school.  I've always been tech support, but that was in a small school where there were very few tech problems anyway.  I now go to a very big school where I have been designated tech support by several teachers again.  After spending all of last year fixing silly things like Word document margins, I guess those teachers bragged about my \"mad skills.\"  That means that this year, I am told to fix random computer issues, regardless of whether it's something that the school district is causing and therefore uncontrollable by me.\n\nThis is a story about my experiences in the AP Spanish computer lab (actually it's for the entire department, but we are the only ones who use it as it's connected to our classroom).  Yesterday, I had just entered the classroom when the teacher told me to go fix all of the computers.  \n\n&gt; **SF5k: ** okay, what do you want me to do?\n\n&gt; **Teacher: ** fix my computers please!\n\n&gt; **S: ** which ones?\n\n&gt; **T: ** they are all broken, I need you to fix them\n\n\nSo I went into the lab and began going down the line, seeing which ones need \"fixing.\"\n\n\nThe problems that a public school computer lab faces are hilarious.  First of all, some kids like to mess with the computers and unplug power cords.  However, the power cords were nowhere to be found.  In the lab there is a closet filled with baskets of cords and cables.  I found a handful of the power cables in the closet and proceeded to plug them into computers that weren't working.  Most started to boot up.\n\nBut then I encountered another problem: video cables.  The lab computers are your typical Dell desktops that are made to be as generic and stale as can be.  However, they have a PCI GPU (I don't know why they have external gfx either).  That means that I can't plug the VGA cable from monitor to desktop.  I don't really care about the video quality and I'm sure no one else does either.  But the computer does, as when I boot it tells me that you must use the GPU and not onboard VGA.  So I have to go through the closet again (after putting the power cable bin on top) and find VGA (monitor) to DVI (GPU).  Of course, I can't find that cable so I have to settle for an adapter.  It takes a while to find adapters for every single computer with a GPU.\n\nThe last problem is with three more computers.  Every time they boot up they show a \"Non-system disk error ... please replace and try again\" message which I can't fix because this district requires all part orders to be filed through the district to get installed \"officially.\"",

        "text": "*Insert Long time Lurker, First time poster here. Also still trying to figure out Reddit post formatting so hopefully this doesn't look butchered...*  \n\nA mildly incomplete story I remembered recently back from when I was in Tech Support. I was on the internal service desk for a company that has 2 multistory buildings next to each other under their thumb (you can probably already see where this is going).  \n  \n$U = User  \n$C = Me  \n  \n$U submits a ticket saying his Panasonic Toughbook is no longer functional. I pick up the Ticket and email them.  \n  \n$C Good Morning $U. Could you please describe what exactly is wrong with your Laptop?  \n  \nA few minutes later, I get an email back  \n  \n$U : I will come down and see you. (our support desk was in the same building as this guy.)  \n  \nSure enough, He turns up about 5 minutes later.  \n  \n&gt;$U : Hi $C, I emailed about my laptop not working.  \n&gt;$C : Ah yes, can I take a look?  \n&gt;$U : Sure, here it is.  \n  \nHe hands me a box. I could tell without opening it that inside the box was...well... the remnants of the laptop.  \n  \n&gt;$C : May I ask what exactly happened to this?  \n&gt;$U : I went to talk to someone and was put it down, and it fell.  \n&gt;$C : And where abouts were you?  \n&gt;$U : In the meeting rooms up on the top floor.  \n&gt;$C : And what did you put it down on.  \n&gt;$U : (in a hushed tone) The Window Sill.  \n&gt;$C : Are you going to tell me this laptop fell out a window. From the top floor.  \n$U nods.  \n  \nI open the box, and sure enough, the laptop is basically in pieces. I call over the manager and explain that this user just dropped his laptop out a window from the third floor onto the concrete below. Just to add insult to injury, the user pips up.  \n\n&gt;$U : Can I get my data back?   \n\nI don't know much about the final outcome, as I left the company a few days later. However our manager basically explained this was the second time he had physically broken a laptop in 4 months, so either he is the most unlucky/silly person in history, or he did it on purpose to get a new one. Long story short, he was going to be charged for a new one. He also did get most of his data back. Thank god for automatic daily backups eh?",

Good thing, because today was potluck day, and I look about three months pregnant with this food baby...\n\nLess than an hour before going-home time, I get a call from $EntitledMom ($EM). I can only imagine she has the classic \"I Need To Speak With Your Manager\" haircut...\n\n&gt;$me: How can I help you?  \n$EM: Yes, I'm the parent of a student there, and I just got a new phone and I need help getting $2FA set up on it so I can get into $SchoolAccessPage and put money on her dining plan account.\n\n*Note: $SchoolAccessPage is a portal for students, alumni, staff, and faculty* only*. Parents have no business getting on this page, as they have their own $ParentPage, which allows them to see their student's grades, add money to their dining plan, and so on. Students and parents are told this. Multiple times.*\n\n&gt;$me: Ma'am, might I ask why?  \n$EM: So I can put money on my daughter's dining plan.  \n$me: $SchoolAccessPage isn't where you would do that, ma'am. You would actually need to long in $ParentPage with your email address and password and add money that way, as there's no way to do it through $SchoolAccessPage.  \n$EM: Yes, it is. I've done it before.  \n$me: Ma'am, I can assure you that's not where you went to add money. Like I said, you would need to log into $ParentPage, and that does not require you to have the $2FA app on your phone.  \n$EM: You're not listening to me. I log into $SchoolAccessPage to put money on her account. She said she called you all earlier and she followed their instructions, then told me to go to that page.  \n$me: No, you don't. I am listening. I think there is a misunderstanding somewhere, as I am very sure parents log in to $ParentPage to add money to their student's dining plans.  \n$EM (huffily): Well, then, I guess she's not getting any money on her dining card. *click*  \n$me: I guess not, lady.\n\nTL;DR: That's the wrong door, lady, no matter what your daughter told you.",

We have to call. \n\nThis female called in. There is a software on her Mac which is not working as expected. I find out she is running and old version of OS and guide her to download the upgrade for the latest version.\n\nAs the download and install is going to take a while, I send her my contact information and ask her to contact me if the issue she had persists after the upgrade. \n\nSeem fine, right? Download, install and then test the issue.\n\nNext day I notice she sent me an email after I had ended my shift:\n\nCustomer: I have a problem. The installation has stopped and not going as it should. \n\nMe: alright, when can I call you today?\n\nTime passes by and I'm not receiving a response.

I keep thinking about it. She isn't able to use her machine because there is something wrong with the upgrade, and she doesn't seem so rushed, but I guess it's not my problem. Still, though, it is my case and I want to resolve it asap. \n\nAnother day passes by and finally today I was able to call her after receiving a response. \n\nMe: okay, so you told me in the email that something happened during the installation. Can you specify? What do you see on the screen? \n\nCustomer: this box popped up about terms and conditions.\n\nMe: okay, and this is where you are not able to proceed?\n\nCustomer: yes.\n\nMe: to be able to proceed, you'll have to click on AGREE if you agree with the terms and conditions.\n\nCustomer: ok.\n\n*clicks AGREE*\n\nCustomer: ok, so now it says it is installing.\n\nMe: great.

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently rediscovered this subreddit and I have a million and a half stories to tell, but I'll start today with one of my favorite stories\n\nI work for a 3rd party tech support company and I provide support for an enterprise backup solution to quite a few large companies.  The thing to note here is that my clients aren't your average end user, they're IT admins who are running an environment, so theoretically, they should have a basic understanding of how these things work\n\nSo this one day I get a call from a customer regarding a backup failure he's getting, the error message says that the backup server can't connect to the client.  Now, there are usually two reasons why you'll get this error, either your backup client software has been stopped, or you have no network connectivity.  While on the phone with this guy, the first thing I ask him to do is go on his backup server and try to ping the client.  It doesn't ping.  Normally this is where I tell them that they need to get network connectivity up before the backup will work but he claims that this is by design and that it should not be able to ping the client.  My first thought was \"oh, he has ICMP disabled\" so I ask if we can SSH or Telnet into the client, but he says both of those are disabled.  Eventually I asked him if we could temporarily reenable ICMP so that ping would work and we could verify connectivity, his reply?  ICMP should be enabled:\n\n\"So then why can't it ping?\"\n\n\"That is by design\"\n\n\"But there's no connectivity between your backup server and the client it's trying to back up\"\n\n\"Yes, we intentionally designed it that way for security\"\n\nI tried to explain that you can't take a backup without connectivity and he said that his networking team had sorted it all out, I asked if one of the network engineers was available to talk and he said no.\n\nWe went back and forth for about 2 weeks on this until his manager got on the phone with me and asked to escalate the case to a higher severity level explaining that the backup should work and that they didn't need connectivity for them to work\n\nI asked him several times if we could get one of the network engineers on the phone and finally he relented, he got me ALL of the network engineers.  He dumped me into a conference call with the entire 15 person network team.  It also turns out they weren't expecting me on the call and none of them knew who I was.\n\nAfter a brief explanation of what I had been going through I had finally gotten a straight answer:\n\nThey had designed their environment with two networks, a primary network for production servers to communicate with each other and a backup network for the backup server to communicate with any clients it was attempting to back up.  The production network had been build and the manager wanted to do a security audit on it, so he halted the project to build the backup network until the audit of the production network was complete.  The backup server had never been connected to any servers other than itself and one test server\n\nThe worst part?  They failed their security audit because they didn't have backups in place\n\nI finally got everything working when, in order to pass the security audit, they allowed the backup server to be connected to the production network temporarily to take backups until the backup network was fully built",

        "text": "**$LuLu:** Our manager.  \n**$TheAncientOne:** My director. Overall really cool guy but has a slight obsession with his collegeball team and $iFruit electronics.  \n**$Burrito:** New-ish in her IT career. Her preference to burritos is unknown, but it fits well with her actual name.   \n**$Wonderland:** Previous employee. Personification of \"you're way too happy for a Monday morning\".  \n**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In the beginning:**  \nAs mentioned in a previous tale $Wonderland first came to us through the Internship program, and we decided to keep her beyond the 90 days. Now, she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. Though, to be fair, her class came directly after $Burrito's class so the bar was set pretty high. However, where $Wonderland lacked in technical skill she did very well in people skills. She was very perky and peppy. Bluntly put, she wasn't a social potato as is the norm for most IT folks who are in the field. Thus, we decided to hire her onboard as a spokesperson of sort. She would be the one to meet with company heads face to face, conduct trainings, and do most everything that required interacting with important people. Had we find another unicorn? Well....  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Complication:**  \n$Lulu was several months pregnant at this point. Two of her main responsibilities was doing payroll and fulfilling equipment orders. Our original plan was to have our old accountant help out for a couple months while $Lulu was on maternity leave, but he had to turn us down as his health wasn't the greatest at that time. So, backup plan! We were gonna have our warehouse manager do payroll (she had experience with $FastPages software), and $Wonderland was going to be in charge the day-to-day equipment orders. Nothing too complicated, just a matter of giving her the right vendor contacts and access to our $Nile account. $Lulu was supposed to spend a few months with $Wonderland going over this, but $LuluBaby was being fussy so $Lulu had to leave much earlier than anticipated. No big deal. Right?......right?!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down the Rabbit Hole:**  \nAt this point $Lulu has been out for a few weeks. $LuluBaby was born strong and healthy which meant that $Lulu was in full mommy-mode! $Wonderland had moved into her temporary office and had put her spokesperson duties on hold so that she could cover for $Lulu....or so we thought.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Burrito:** Hey, has anyone seen $Wonderland?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** I heard that she was working late last night so she probably got the okay to come in late today?  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** Hmm? Wasn't she dropping off flowers for $Lulu at the hospital?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Umm, sure? You can try calling her if you want.  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** *Ring Ring....Ring Ring....* Nothing, went to voicemail.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Might still be asleep? Just shoot her a text and let her know you need to talk to her.  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** (Text to $Wonderland) Where you be? Give me a call? Kthnx!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Tickets came into the queue, tickets were closed out, same ol' same ol'. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Burrito:** Uhh, $Wonderland still hasn't responded.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** *Annoyed sigh* I got this *calls $TheAncientOne* Hey, have you heard from $Wonderland?  \n&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** No? Was I supposed to?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Well, she hasn't come into the office all day and apparently she was out during most of the day for the hospital visit. Do you know anything about her working late last night?  \n&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Nope, she didn't get any overtime approved to stay late yesterday...  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh boy, unapproved overtime is the easiest way to get on $TheAncientOne's bad side. The day ended, and no one had heard from $Wonderland.  The following day she still wan't in the office and was still being unresponsive.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Okay, I'm going to have to assume that $Wonderland has gone MIA. $Burrito, can I have you look at her queue just check to make sure there aren't any outstanding orders?  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** Uhh, I can try.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[approximately 7 seconds later...]\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Burrito:** Holy Turkey!!! There are like 30 orders that have been sitting there for weeks!!  \n&gt;**$Everyone:** WHAT?!  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** Just look at this turkey, the orders have just been sitting there since $Lulu left!!  \n&gt;**$Savy:** What has she been doing this whole time???  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point $Burrito relays this information to $TheAncientOne and is told by him to drop what she's doing and get the ball rolling on those orders. Shortly after, we hear our senior engineer laughing, and he asks us to take a peek at what he found on the cameras. On the screen, we see $Wonderland coming into the warehouse earlier in the week around 8PM and is seen moving potted plants and trees in and out of the warehouse to her office upstairs. We all decide to look into her office and found that she had turned her office into a small rain forest.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** I'll give anyone two guesses as to what she has been doing the past couple of weeks...  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**To be continued...:**  \nWhat was $Wonderland doing all those weeks? Are all those trees cramped up into an office a fire code violation? Will $Savy have lemonade for lunch? Find out next time on $404Comp!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Formatting and spelling  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Looking for [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7dn80r/adventures_in_wonderland_through_the_loony_glass/)?**",

        "text": "Actors in this play are as follows. This happened yesterday by the way. Today's events will be posted tomorrow. \n\n&gt; $HHR=Head of HR  \n\n&gt; $Me = ME\n\n&gt; $HIT = Head of IT\n\n&gt; $T = Tech\n\n&gt; $U = User\n\nI got an email this morning with a scathing report about one of my techs. \n\n&gt; $HHR - I need to inform you of a situaiton I have been made aware of. It seems one of your techs massively violated the IT data policy and security policy last night. I have gone ahead and submitted the termination paperwork to your boss $HIT. \n\n&gt; Please be aware that this kind of behavior will never be tolerated. I hope that I never have to remind you of this again.\n\nAround this time one of the accounts team comes over and asks about this. I told them that it was not approved by me and to keep it quiet while I discuss it with $hit. \n\nThe discussion did not take long as the event in question was already flagged for defense. IE I personally flagged it because the tech told me it may come back to bit him in the ass. \n\nI re-review the call logs and oh boy is it dumb. I will just skip to the part in question. \n\n&gt; $U - Yes I need that mapped to the B drive (branch drive). \n\n&gt; $T - I can do that for you, however you should know that this location is already mapped to the S drive for scanning. \n\n&gt; $U - ...OK? I am not understanding what you mean. \n\n&gt; $T - The drive you are requesting access to is already mapped to a different drive letter. \n\n&gt; $U - No I need access to the B drive not the S drive. *Talking to coworkers thinking she is out of earshot.* Wow when did they hire idiots to work on the helpdesk? ... I know right. Its like we are the dumb ones or something.\n\nHad to clean up the audio in *free audio tool everyone uses* first but I was able to get it by compressing it twice. \n\n&gt; $T - OK I will just map the drive for you. \n\n&gt; $U - You do know you are speaking to a member of management right?\n\n&gt; $T - *Mutes mic noise* Lady I don't care. You are not my manager and are not involved in my management chain. *Unmutes mic noise* Yes mam I do understand that. I apologize if I have come across as terse. I have mapped the drive here. \n\n&gt; $U - Wait...this is the same as the S drive. \n\n&gt; $T - *mutes mic again* I just said that...you know what? *unmutes mic* Yes I had said that earlier that you already had the drive mapped.\n\n&gt; $U - YOU CANT HAVE! ... You cant have 2 access points to the same data. This is a HUGE violation. \n\n&gt; $T - Umm no it is not. Everyone who is on citrix has an \"access point\" to the same data. \n\n&gt; $U - No they do not. No one has access to MY computer. \n\n&gt; $T - Well mam we actually do cause citrix does not run on your computer. It runs off of a server here in *our city.* See watch this.\n\nHe placed a text file on her desktop named \"test.\"\n\n&gt; $U - YOU JUST ACCESSED MY SYSTEM!!! I did NOT authorize that. What is the name of your manager. \n\n&gt; $T - I just sent you an email with the contact information for $Me and $HIT\n\n&gt; $U - I am sorry but I have no choice now. I have to report this massive violation to your managers. *hangs up*\n\nI emailed $HHR back with this lovely gem.\n\n&gt; $ME - After reviewing the event in question, it has been determined that the fault lie 100 percent with the user here. Her clear lack of knowledge in regards to basic server technology led to her thinking she had her machine breached. \n\n&gt; I have canceled the termination order on my end as well as the emergency maintenance ticket she put in to the orders team. \n\n&gt; In the future all concerns about my team are to come through me. We have a process for terminating an employee, which you set up, that you violated. The employee in question did nothing wrong and was unjustly judged by people who have no understanding of basic computer technology. \n\n&gt; Please do not violate the policy you set in place for terminating an employee in the future...I hope that I never have to remind you of this again.\n\nI sent a copy of that to $hit the CIO and the EVPIT. (Or the executive vice president of IT and Technology) \n\nAbout 2 hours later I get an email back from the EVPIT. He apologized for the way that the head of HR acted and promised me that the tech in question will not receive any punishment as he listened to the call himself. \n\nTwo hours later I am being told that my anual employee review is being pushed up to tomorrow by the head of HR.

But a call came through and I answered as per usual.\n\nThis user calls up chasing a ticket regarding not being able to logon to a windows 10 laptop, and I look up the ticket and decide that I can help, and that he will need to have his profile reset so as to iron out any problems with it. (This was a fairly common fix)\n\nI ask the user to log off, and to restart the machine as per when I run this fix for most users. And then I checked the login audit for his profile.\n\nMe, my colleague and the guy sat behind me couldn't believe it.\n\nThis user is logged on to 5 different computers.\nAt the same time.\nHe Hasn’t logged off a single computer.\n\nI ask the user if he has been logging off his machines, and he says he’d just been shutting them down by holding down the power button. *Shudder*\n\nI then ask the user if he could possibly go and log off these computers, as this would make us able to run a fix. He doesn’t remember where they are.\n\nSo I check where they are.\n\nThe first two, are in the same office, on the same floor. Another, same building, next floor down.\n\nThe other two, are in a different City.\n\nSo I take the user off hold and inform him of this, and after the initial hostility of me telling him to drive for an hour or so just to log off two computers, he was fairly polite as I gave him the ID numbers, and gave him the rough location of the workstations.\n\nBy the end of the call I had 2 of my collegues behind me laughing at the poor guy.\n\nI’ve only been on the desk a week.\n\n \n\nTL;DR User didn’t ever log off.

        "text": "I'm more of a web developer and a lost youth looking for direction in life, but – seeing as I know my bits from my bytes – I occasionally become tech support. A few weeks ago I was called by a friend I've known for all but very few of my days on Earth. A friend and lodger of hers (say, Flo?) had a problem, and I had been selected to solve it.\n\n&gt; Flo: A client of mine is having trouble with her email. Could I ask you some questions about the issue?  \n&gt; Blieque: Fire away!  \n&gt; Flo: Well a few weeks ago somebody hacked her email account, it seems. I've changed her password, but all emails sent by her appear to come from a different address. We think this other address is controlled by the hacker and that they can potentially see confidential mail intended for my client when sent as a reply. Does this sound possible?\n\nIntriguing! I was sceptical of the involvement of a malicious party, but it sounded worth investigating nevertheless. I explained the difference between `From` and `Reply-To` email headers, and my suspicion that the latter was being set incorrectly somewhere. I agreed to visit the client with Flo the following week, and I'd be sure to bring my detechtive hat.\n\n***\n\nNext week rolls around and, after we arrange a time, I hop in the car and head to my friend's. We enjoy some splendid enchiladas, then Flo and I set off to the client. The client (she can be Mary) is in her 80s but shows little of it, and welcomes us with a platter of light comestibles upon our slightly late arrival.\n\nHer computer is a fairly aged desktop running Windows 10, which unsurprisingly performs like an aged desktop running Windows 10. We log into the previously-compromised email account, which is hosted by a major *British telecom*munications company, and send some test mail. As I had suspected, the `Reply-To` header is set to an email address with a slight modification; two lowercase letter \"i\"s where there should be one. I'm not aware of a way to set this field with just SMTP and IMAP, so I remove (just to be safe) and re-add the email account to Mary's iPad. I send a second test, now from from the iPad rather than the ISP's webmail client, and, surprise surprise, there's no dodgy `Reply-To` header.\n\nAs much as I had expected this, it's still odd. Flo has spent several hours on multiple occasions speaking with the ISP's tech support, and they have reportedly checked all there is to check on their end, and haven't spotted anything awry. I dig around the webmail settings and eventually find the `Reply-To` configuration option which tech support missed. Whether changed by a criminal or not, the field clearly displays the wrong address. I clear the field and send another test email to check all is now well.\n\nAll is well in the mail header regard, but the whole ordeal has instilled some well-placed skepticism in Mary of the ISP's email service, security, and technical competence. (Side note: I have heard that this ISP is the most complained-about company in the country, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was.) Mary had decided to start using a secondary iCloud email address at Flo's suggestion when the issue was first noticed, so we decide to move permanently to this account. Here begins Act II.\n\nAs the result of several years of email contact with roughly 900 people, Mary has a great number of email addresses that can be readily accessed. We want to bring this contact list to the new email account to hopefully eliminate any reliance on the old account. I figure the easiest approach is to export just the addresses and import them somehow into iCloud. As the ISP's webmail client doesn't have such an export feature, I turn to Mozilla Thunderbird. I suppose one tends to look at the past with rose-tinted glasses, or I must at least; Thunderbird has only ever served to cause me more frustration than I expect to endure, but I perhaps-naïvely head it's way nonetheless.\n\nThunderbird very clearly defines contacts and address books, and despite my fervent searching, I can't find a way to easily import addresses and names from ~20,000 emails. After some thorough exercise of my index finger navigating many a menu, Flo mentions that Mary used to use a different mail client on her computer. What should it turn out to be, but Windows Live Mail? I'd later realise that this software want quite as archaic as I thought – my days of Windows Live Messenger are many moons past – but I'm surprised to even see it. It has all but the last few days of email already stored locally too, so it won't need to fetch it all like I just told Thunderbird to. The killer feature? Windows Live Mail can export all contacts from an archive of mail as vCard profiles. I give it the go-ahead, and start to look at adding them to an iCloud account.\n\n\nI figure the iCloud webmail client is hardly likely to have a vCard importer, so I set about adding the account to Thunderbird or Windows Live Mail instead. If there's an Act II, Scene II, it begins here. It turns out that IMAP and POP with iCloud is more involved than one would think, and *requires* per-application passwords and two-factor authentication to be enabled. These are great from a security standpoint, but I fear they may serve to merely complicate Mary's digital life. Despite that, we power through some security questions, and then some more, with Mary getting a perfect opportunity to tell us about her childhood best friend. With the account added in Thunderbird, I realise that importing contacts is going to present the same problems that exporting them did; Thunderbird doesn't treat accumulated addresses as part of the address book. Similarly, the address book is not associated with an email account, so Thunderbird will never inform iCloud of any imported contacts. I would later realise that IMAP does not have protocol support for anything of this sort, so the final solution was probably the best in the end.\n\nI decide that the quickest yet not cleanest way to get the contacts into the iCloud account, and therefore the iPad, would be to copy all the email. I tell Thunderbird what to do, and it starts dutifully uploading the many thousand emails. As we take our final nibbles from our generous snack selection and give our thanks (and some final instructions) to Mary, I notice the computer get stuck into the email of November 2011.\n\n***\n\nI have seen Flo since, but the email saga didn't make it into conversation, so I suppose all went well. I'm undecided about how the mystery `Reply-To` configuration came about, but Mary's now using a much tidier and more secure email account, so I suppose all is well that ends well.\n\nSorry if I rambled; criticism is welcome.",

        "text": "Second tale of the day. That rarely happens. If you've read my other stories, you know I work at a university with many special snowflake faculty, who want everything handed to them, and want everything to be working all the time.\n\nBy now, I've got quite a few tales about getting Secure Print going for the school, and we're at the tail-end of getting the project wrapped up. The TLDR version of Secure Print is essentially sending print jobs to a server, then only releasing them to print by walking up to any printer on campus with your ID/pin. I'm still getting a few requests from faculty claiming they can't print, only to point them to the correct printer and explain that this is no longer the case for one print, but the idea is that it's universal.\n\nI had one faculty member set up an appointment with me, and I figured this would be one of those as many from this school had the above issue, all of them being on PC. I walk over to his office because I have other appointments I can't do remotely afterwards, and the first thing that concerns me is that his laptop looks nothing like one of ours. He will be $FM for faculty member.\n\n&gt;$Me: So just to clarify before we get going here, is that a personal laptop, or a $University laptop?\n\n&gt;$FM: This is my personal laptop.\n\nAnd he conveniently left that important piece of information out until I got over to his office, which has always been the case for me in the past. Most corporate places would not allow personal devices on the network (the network being ethernet in this case, not wireless) for security reasons, but being in higher ed, rules like that are more relaxed because certain faculty will push for their \"right\" to do those things until our CIO caves into other VIP's requests. So we can't tell them, \"Don't bring your personal computer in.\" but we can tell them \"We don't support it, and if I so much as touch it, I could be in a lot of trouble.\" We can walk them through certain things as a \"best effort support.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: We don't support personal laptops. I can't touch that machine.\n\n&gt;$FM: That's going to be a problem then because I need to print. Do you think you can walk me through it?\n\nI just learned that the Secure Printer can be added manually within an AD account, but it's per account, so it needs to be added manually for every user if it doesn't show up (I'm dealing with this issue on a different set of PCs). However, it does not show up under a local admin account, not within AD. I walk him through adding a printer manually but it doesn't show up.\n\n&gt;$Me: Sorry, there's nothing else I can do.\n\n&gt;$FM: What would you recommend for me to be able to print then?\n\n&gt;$Me: File a request for a $University laptop since you should've been provided one when you started (if their boss filled out the form correctly...)\n\n&gt;$FM: *laughs* I'm not using a $University laptop. The 13-inch screens are too small, they're slow, and they're never replaced. With the software I work with (audio), I need a 17-inch screen and a number pad. I also don't want to lug around two laptops.\n\n&gt;$Me: I understand, but we have to adhere to standards and the administration is the one that makes that decision on ordering laptops. If you have special requirements for your job, they're the ones that can make an exception to our standards. And as far as the replacement cycle goes, we are trying to get everyone back onto one. It's not perfect yet but we are working on it.\n\n&gt;$FM: Alright, well sorry to waste your time.\n\nI walked out of there and couldn't help but think, \"This guy basically just said he would need a non-standard souped-up machine, that he would want replaced within a standard replacement cycle.\"",

About a week after I closed the original ticket, I get an email from a Service Desk manager saying \"Hey, just so you know we opened a new ticket for this person having more printer issues but figured we would let you know since we saw you worked with them recently.\"\n\n*eye roll*\n\nSo I pull the new ticket and try to get ahold of them, but they're not available. Later, I email them and we set up and appointment for today. I walk over to the office as I have to drop off a battery for someone else in the same building, but go to her office first.\n\nWithin 30 seconds, I see one of the most common PEBKAC errors, the printer she wanted was not set to default, so when she hit print, she wasn't even looking at what it was going to. It was set to a nonexistent printer, \"Send to OneNote 2013\" I let her sit down, run a test print, and explain it to her. She will be $FM (faculty member).\n\n&gt;$Me: It wasn't printing because you weren't selecting the printer from the list. I changed the default to that printer and sent a test page.\n\n&gt;$FM: You mean all I had to do was select the printer from the list? But I swear on the day I placed the ticket that it wasn't there!\n\nI'm suspicious because I'm the one who added the printer way back when it was replaced, and it's been on there each time I've worked on her PC, so I imagine she's just trying to save herself the embarrassment of looking dumb.\n\n&gt;$Me: Well I don't have an explanation for that, all I know is that it's working now.\n\nThe only thing I'm grateful for is that she was extremely grateful to me about getting it working and thanked me a bunch for all of my work.",

He replied:\n\n&gt; “My expectation was it …. had a loose connection of some sort…I do not concur with it having liquid or dents, but regardless, do we really need to pay this much for repair or can’t it be done cheaper elsewhere? What did they cover in the warranty? (Not liquid damage, dude.) Can they send the photo of which ‘dent’ and ‘liquid’ they discovered? (Quotes are his)\n\nPictures come in of the laptop. Obvious liquid damage. The port for the hard drive is…covered in….lint? Fur? Either way it looks disgusting. Have not heard back from him yet.\n\nThanks for reading!

It didn’t work because he created a 32 bit route with a 24 bit subnet mask. Senior system engineer refused to tell him this because he wanted him to figure it out for himself. After he banged his head against the desk for 30 mins, I started to get interested and asked about the problem. I’ve been out of networking for a long time, so I looked up the CIDR cheat sheet and sure enough – it says to use a 32 bit netmask. Junior system engineer doesn’t understand so I tell him “Dude, just go download the CIDR cheat sheet and if your address uses 32 bits in that column, use the mask that’s in the second column which is also 32 bits.” We go back and forth on this for a few minutes where he refuses to download the CIDR sheet and starts reading off his notes. Eventually we convince him to download the cheat sheet, but he can’t seem to find one on the entirety of the internet. I look over and he has Google Images up with pictures of apple cider all over his screen.",

        "text": "[*Previously on TFTS...*](https://redd.it/7cwkt6)\n\n*Also, [Glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7d524l/more_from_aviation_maintenancemurphys_law_part_ii/dpv0yf5/) is in the comments.*\n\n***\nImagine for me, if you will, that you are a bolt.  Not just any bolt, but a **close tolerance bolt**.  Close tolerance bolts are machined to a fit tolerance of +0.0000 to -0.0005 inch.  Because of the tolerances involved, the bolt cannot be cadmium plated, so to prevent corrosion it needs to be installed ‘wet’—with some sort of lubricant to act as a protective compound.  Thus, you, my friendly close tolerance bolt, are installed in a deep, dark place in an [engine pylon]( https://i.stack.imgur.com/joRiG.jpg) (the structure above the engine in this picture) that seldom ever sees the light of day and are always going from hot to cold to hot to humid to hot to cold….\n\nAnd let’s not even get started on the vibrations you’d be exposed to daily for hours on end.\n\nEventually, after many, many years, you’re going to get very, very used to your home and that layer of protective grease would dry out and become ineffective.  Eventually, perhaps, even a little bit of water seeps in and a bit of corrosion sets in place, further helping you become fused with your home.\n\nAnd then one day, Joe Mechanic suddenly slaps a wrench on your head and starts *twisting*.  Instead of oiling you down, letting it soak in, making you comfortable and removing the nut off your feet before gently backing you out into forever retirement, he just wrenches away, twisting you and pulling.  Now, you’re a close tolerance bolt.  You’ve had some light corrosion form in what little space there is.  You’re now going to smear and scrape and grab and drag and generally fight the whole time as that mechanic drags you out of your home, kicking and screaming.  And in in the end, not only have you been abused and beaten, but you’ve [galled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galling) out the bore of your old home.\n***\n###Day 13\n\nI came in to work, feeling optimistic and (somewhat) rested.  Say one thing about having a child, the father might get more sleep than the mother during these early months, but the quality just isn’t there.  More recently it’s been found that I’ve got blood pressure issues so I’ve pretty much switched over to herbal tea, but back when this happened I could still enjoy the sweet dark nectar that is coffee throughout the day.  In keeping with tradition, I filled my cup first thing, walked the plane briefly while the crew was in a morning meeting and then sat down to peruse my email.  \n\nWaiting for me at the top of the queue was a request from $LGE for confirmation of the missing grounding stud.  Over the next hour, while I worked on my morning reports I also replied to $LGE, providing him additional confirmations culminating in sending him photos of the affected area.  I left for my morning meeting series and while I was gone to those, he requested confirmation of the area and problem one more time, which I provided again.  \n\nDuring my morning meeting, $ProductionManager asked that we shave three to seven days off this visit so that we could push it out before the end of the month and boost the organizational numbers for the month…likely for the normal reasons.  (You know, making Upper Management look good.)  Looking at what was going on, I provided the normal acceptable protest and then confirmed it was doable.\n\nMeanwhile, $TRPE3 sent an email to his boss, Planning and Local Engineering informing them that he was still waiting on one rivet type to be delivered and then he would be coming up—Instead of on Day 14 as we were told the prior week, but on day 16…\n\nNo one decided to share this information with us.\n***\nLooking up in the hole with a flashlight, the inspector frowned.  He checked the bore one more time with his specialized NDT (non-destructive testing) tool (eddy-current, I think…) and made a few notes on his work card before he stalked to the computer to write a non-routine…\n***\nAfter lunch, another email popped into my inbox--$LGE had submitted a special informational request to $AircraftManufacturer.  I logged that in my notes, perused the queue on the computer once more and discovered a new non-routine had entered the pile.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Hey, $Lead, what’s going on with Non-Routine 123?  The corrosion in the #2 engine pylon bolt hole inspection?”\n\n&gt;**Lead** “Oh, no big deal.  Just like we had on the #1.  We’ll just let engineering know and they’ll send us a PRI for it.”\n\n*PRIs are Preliminary Repair Instructions.  They’re the initial instructions we get from the engineers so we can keep working.*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “So it won’t hurt our ready time?  $ProductionManager wants us to take several days off this check.”\n\n&gt;**Lead**  “We don’t have the manpower down here!  *sigh*  No, it shouldn’t hurt it.”\n***\n\nA Local Engineer, $LCE, drops off a document in the later evening.  That night, machine shop comes out to the aircraft and bores out the bolt hole to 1st Oversize—a fraction of an inch larger than the original size, and will require a larger diameter bolt.  After review, the pitting in the bore is still present—further instructions will be required from $LCE…\n\nMeanwhile, after midnight a truck arrives on the loading dock.  A new set of passenger seats have arrived for our beleaguered plane, specially modified back at The Mothership.  A supply manager removes the shipping paperwork from the crates and begins to review the Airworthiness forms verifying the parts are good to be installed…\n***\n###Day 14\n\nChecking my inbox upon arrival and caffeination, I see the $AircraftManufacturer had provided an acknowledgement of $LGE’s request and told us we’d have a response by lunchtime on Day 16.    I then set about my morning meeting routine.  I made note of a second PRI issued to further clean up the hole on the engine pylon and thought nothing of it.  \n\nPartway through the morning, I realized I’d heard nothing out of the engineers for the Thrust Reversers and sent out an email asking when they’d be showing up.  $TRPE3 responds, forwarding me his email about the missing rivet type and that we wouldn’t see him for another two days.  He never specified what rivet was missing, and on a hunch I figured we had them in stock in our Composite Shop, which always seems to be hiding things that ‘we don’t have.’  \n\nIn the middle of this, I’m interrupted by the supply manager, who informs me the paperwork for the new seats don’t match the seats themselves.  As a lead who was assisting me would later find out, it would seem the part numbers on the seats were special part numbers that have nothing to do with the mod that was done and what we actually needed.   We also soon found there were other typos in the paperwork as well.\n\nMeanwhile, on the floor Machine Shop comes back out and bores out the hole to the 2nd oversize, but inspection finds the corrosion still remains….except now all realize it isn’t corrosion, it is galling from removing the bolt.  \n\nIn the meantime, I journey over to the composite shop once I have the part numbers in hand.  After sweet talking the dragons that guard their bench stock, I was given permission to peruse and discovered that, yes, indeed the special rivets were here.  In fact, everything they needed was sitting here because, as it turns out, *composite shop had been doing this inspection for years before it became an AD.*  Of course, no big deal now, right?\n\nPer the rules, it didn’t count because it wasn’t AD paperwork.  So therefore, the shop method they had been using for years, with the parts and part equivalencies they’ve been using for years *meant nothing* and composite shop would have to wait for engineering to issue them special AD paperwork because, thanks to the AD, *every single thrust reverser they had in our shop, which rebuilds them, was no longer airworthy in spite of having had been inspected already.*\n\nA little bit more dead inside, I let $TRPE3 know that we’ve got the missing rivets, so, could he please get down here already?  $TRPE3 requested verification immediately, wanting to make sure they were the actual part itself, not some equivalent number and adds in a supply engineer.  I inform $TRPE3 that, yes, in fact it IS the correct stuff, they’re still in the original packaging….to which the supply engineer replies that oh, oops…*he never ordered the rivets in the first place.* But hey, he’s ordered the parts and they’ll be in tomorrow night!  Frustrated, I tell the engineer again, I’ve got the rivets here.  All of them.  Please come.  Now.  \n\nBack on the Engine Pylon, $LCE comes down again with a PRI to once more bore out the hole a little more, to the much fabled and seldom used 3rd oversize.  He also warns us that we might have to replace the whole pylon, just in case $AircraftManufacturer doesn’t buy off on the repair.  He also sent them a support request.\n\nThe end of my day reached, I get a message from $TRPE3 as I’m walking across the parking lot:\n\n&gt;**$TRPE3** “Hey, can you please verify that you have the correct rivets and send me a picture of a rivet head or the packaging?”\n\n***\n###Day 15\nThe next morning we made a plan to move ahead on the thrust reversers and open up the panels, and forget the engineers.  We’d need a specialist from Composite Shop to come down and help one of our guys drill out the rivets on the exterior panels—it’s a specialty rivet that requires a particular technique to drill out and the panel is a composite panel.  If we screwed up in the least, we would need an ERA to fix it because…AD.\n\nAgain, $TRPE3 requests the photos of the rivets, and again I provide photos.  Finally, he calls me up and lets me know he’ll fly in tonight and be in bright eyed tomorrow morning.\n\nI went back to the loading docks to investigate the seats next, and discovered that even the pre-modification part numbers were wrong, the work cards instructing the Mothership how to modify the seats had the wrong part numbers, and finally that the work card doesn’t even **tell** the people doing the modification to put the correct part numbers on the seats.  I call up receiving inspections’ manager to explain the situation and that the simple solution would be to let us put the part number on the seats according to the PRI the interior engineer had given us.    Unfortunately, he denied permission and said the Mothership needs to send someone up from their seat shop vendor to fix it.  Which would take another day or three.  \n\nOut to the floor, next, where $AircraftManufacturer provided a response essentially to the effect of…\n\n&gt;**$AircraftManfuacturer**  “WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE?!  WHY would you do THAT without asking us FIRST?!....ugh.  Fine.  Take it up to 0.5000 inches, + or – 0.032 inches.  Inspect it using the NDTProbe5000 tool to make sure it’s good.  If you mess it up, you need to replace the pylon.”\n\nThree hours later, $LCE handed us yet another PRI, putting $AircraftManufacturer’s response into Company-Approved language.  We called up machine shop, handed them the paperwork, and stepped back to watch.\n\n***\nWhen you need to bore out a hole in metal, you often use a reamer.  Generally, they’re slightly tapered to the exact size you’re looking the final hole to be, and precision reamers can get you there down to the barest fraction of an inch.  So long as your hand is steady, your aim is true, you use proper lubrication and there isn’t a major structural or quality deficiency in the reamer.\n\n***\n\nThe machinist stepped back from his work and frowned.  He gauged the hole, then nodded to the inspector who measured it as well.  The inspector came over to us.\n\n&gt;**Inspector** “[The hole is now 0.548 at the top]( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse).”\n\n\n*To Be Continued....next week.*\n",

        "text": "A lot of times tech support gets caught in the middle.  We have anxious users badgering us for fixes, while we have to escalate to some other tech support.  Sometimes that tech support almost sets your equipment on fire...\n\nThis story happened some years ago, a day or two after [a fire in our building](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7cvpgx/your_internet_link_is_down_that_might_be_because/).  We were without mains power, and were getting tons of requests from users (\"how will I print?\"  \"You can't.  We don't have power.  And neither does the file server.  It'll have to wait.\"), going about the building by flashlight, etc.  At the top of people's minds was phones.  We did a lot of business by phone.\n\nOur business phone system (PBX) was an old analog job.  It was supported by our local phone company, who also did PBX work.  The telco had gone through so many spinoffs, mergers, and acquisitions that all the good people left.  The remaining techs were all so... uh... incredible... that I eventually gave each of them a secret nickname.  \n\nThat PBX was the nastiest special snowflake in the company.  It had no backups, the wiring was a terrible mess, it was a proprietary thing that we weren't trained on and weren't allowed to touch.  That didn't stop several execs from telling me to \"just get it up.\"\n\nSo we called up telco on my cell and invoked the disaster response clause in our contract.  It obligated them to bring a generator to power the phone system.  \n\nCowboy Chuck shows up.  \"Cowboy\" was my nickname for him because he would always act first, think second.  He was often causing collateral damage and then using billable hours to fix his disasters.\n\nAnd he brings with him a generator that looked like it came from the set of a horror movie, setting it up right next to the nice shiny loaner generator from the ISP.  Telco generator looked to me like it might provide 80V on a good day, and if we were exceptionally lucky, might even manage alternate our current every few seconds or so.\n\nChuck runs a long, old extension cord from it to the PBX.  He plugs in a power strip and a 60W trouble lamp, then eventually manages to pull-start the generator.  Trouble lamp comes on, but fades brighter and dimmer.  I am not liking this one bit.  I suggested to my boss that we just borrow the second generator that $ISP offered, but he said \"No, they were nice enough with us on the first. $TELCO is obligated to do this.\"  Oh boy.\n\nCowboy Chuck connects power to the PBX.\n\nYou know how when you hear something like a UPS beep, it's always a constant pitch?  Yeah, well this wasn't.  There was a loud alarm, sort of \"BEEEeeeerrrrrrEEEEP\".  Then a loud **CLACK**, and we were left in the darkness.\n\n\"Oh shit,\" says Chuck and rushes out of the room.  In a minute, he's back.\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: I forgot that the UPS doesn't like this generator!  I just fried the UPS and it popped the generator breaker.  Haha, glad I burned that out and not the PBX.  Wouldn't it be funny if I set your PBX on fire right after your other fire?  Hahaha! *chuckling to himself*\n\n&gt; **Me**: Uh, I'm not so...\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: But don't worry, we provided the UPS, so we'll get you a new one next week.\n\n&gt; **Me**: So how will you get our phones up today?\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Oh, I'll just pull out the UPS and plug the PBX straight into the generator.  You'll be fine!\n\n&gt; **Me**: But I don't think...\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Oh don't worry, it'll be fine.  If you keep worrying like that, you'll get sent to the loony bin!  Hahaha!  Now hold on just a sec.\n\nOff he goes to do an impromptu re-cable.\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: OK, I'm gonna plug it in.  You'll be back up in a minute!\n\nHe plugs it in.  The 60W light dims.  The generator sounds like it has a cold.  The PBX comes up, sorta.  Its relays start clicking, a few lamps come on, and then it goes silent.  Generator catches its breath, PBX starts back up, more relay clacks, etc.\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Huh, well that didn't work. That should have worked. *unplugs PBX*  Let's just try it again! *plugs in PBX*\n\nMore of the same.\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Crap. That usually works.  Third time's the charm!\n\n&gt; **Me**: Chuck, stop...\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Nonsense.  Here we go!  *unplug*  *plug*  *CLACK*  *unplug*  Dammit!\n\nChuck's, uh, \"good humor\" finally fades, and he storms out.  At this point, I am thinking:\n\n1) I am going to have a lot of very annoying conversations with execs and users in about 10 minutes.\n\n2) If he hasn't destroyed our PBX already, he is about to.\n\n3) This week is just not going my way.\n\n4) Perhaps it would be safer to stand a few feet farther away from the PBX.\n\nPretty soon, Chuck comes back, all grinning once again.\n\n&gt; **Chuck**: Would you believe it - I forgot to set the choke!  Hahaha.  They'll be laughing at me back at the office over this one!\n\nAnd sure enough, the 60W lamp seemed to be a bit more steady.  Chuck plugged in the PBX, and wonder of wonders, that dumb thing actually powered up and WORKED!\n\nI went to where the execs were gathered, and told them the, er, good news.\n\nBoss puts his hand on my shoulder, and says, in a gentle, reassuring tone:\n\n&gt; Weeks like this are stressful.

Here’s how the conversation went. I’ll be D, agent will be A. \n\n\nD: Tier 2, this is D. \n\n\nA: Hi, I have an issue here. \n\n\nD: Alright. What’s going on?\n\n\nA: I have a business customer who just received their stock in a large truck. Where they’ve parked their truck, they cannot back up the truck or drive forward or they’ll tear the Internet wires down. The business is already out of service. Can we get a tech there ASAP?\n\n\nD: ...how did the truck get there in the first place?\n\n\nA: I have no idea. \n\n\nSo I checked with dispatch who were quite confused and managed to get a tech out to regulate the problem. Just another day in tech support. ",

It is a super hectic environment and sometimes we need to do requests asap.\n\nHospital workers know this and sometimes it drives us IT-support workers nuts. Yester we got \"urgent\" call that monitor suddenly blacked out and it needs to be fixed asap!\n\nFirst I asked what happened when the blackout occurred and is there any lights in the monitor. Answer was something. \"I don't know, I didn't do anything, I just need this to be fixed\"\n\nOkay. I then proceeded and asked that she would make sure that every cable on monitor is connected tightly between monitor and the computer. She said, she has, multiple times, but it just isn't working and she needs it to be working.\n\nOkay, i grab new monitor and some fresh cables and go check the situation.. When I got there, I immediadely noticed that the frigging power cable was not plugged into monitor. When plugged, everything worked great.\n\nI mean come on.. What is the point lying that cables are checked when they clearly was not. And worst is, they sometimes get so angry and somehow blame IT for the problems and of course, they think that we are always available right away. Truth is, that kind of \"trash\" cases takes away resources to do other important IT-stuff.\n\n",

        "text": "For some reason, this memory just came flooding back to me, so now I'm here to share it with you. This was about 3 years ago now. \n\nContext: I worked for *large UK retailer* providing support for their online grocery ordering site over the phone. Majority of our calls were forgotten passwords and missing emails. We had a bunch of steps that fixed the issue 99% of the time. \n\nIt's worth mentioning at this point that, like a lot of major companies, we had an obnoxious IVR that had way too many options. All of the options were named after the company. \n\n&gt;*beep beep*  \n&gt;**ChrizC**: Good morning, *large UK retailer* technical support, *ChrizC* speaking, how can I help?  \n&gt;**Old Caller (OC)**: Good morning young man! I'm trying to login to my account, but I can't remember my password, and I'm not getting an email to reset it! \n\nNot a problem, easy enough. We try fix number 1.\n\nNothing. \n\nFix 2? Nope. \n\nFixes 3 through 7? Nada. \n\nAt this point, I'd tried everything. I even sent him a test email from our email system. Absolutely zilch. \n\nI start thinking I'm gonna need to tell this guy he needs to start from scratch, with a new account. I offer to walk him through the process, as it turns out his grandson originally registered him. \n\nI ask him to click the link labelled \"Register a new *large UK retailer* account.\" \n\n&gt;**OC**: I don't see that anywhere.  \n&gt;**ChrizC**: Hm, it should be underneath the blue login button.  \n&gt;**OC**: My button isn't blue, it's red!  \n&gt;**ChrizC** *(wtf)*: Uhh, okay, can you do me a favour and tell me what's in the big white bar at the top of your screen?  \n&gt;**OC**: Yep! It says... google.co.uk/mail!  \n&gt;**ChrizC** *(realisation in 3, 2, 1)*: Sir, you *are* trying to login to your *large UK retailer* account, right?  \n&gt;**OC**: No, I told you, I'm not getting my emails!  \n&gt;**ChrizC**: Sir, you've called *large UK retailer*. If you can't get into your emails, I suggest you speak to Google directly.  \n&gt;**OC**: Why can't you help me?!  \n&gt;**ChrizC**: I don't work for Google. I have no access to their systems.  \n&gt;**OC**: Why not?! Every website is the same! *(op note: later discovered this meant because he used the same password everywhere, every website had the same account, so I should be able to reset it once and it'd work anywhere)*  \n&gt;**ChrizC**: I'm sorry, sir, but I don't work for Google. You'll have to speak to them to gain access to your emails. \n\nThis went around for another 10 minutes before he triumphantly declared his grandson had come over to visit, and he'll get him to fix it instead. \n\nI still don't know why my brain decided to drudge this back up.",

        "text": "This is a kind of different tale about a printer - one in defense of them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe've got a big A3 capable, &gt;60 pages per minute, color laser machine with 5 paper trays, stapling finisher and all the bells and whistles - and currently a dozen trouble tickets *per week*. In addition to that its automatic email alert system also spams us daily with *tons* of paper jam notifications, errors requiring reboots and even requesting attention of a service technician every other day.  What's wrong with this piece of *beep* you might ask? The users, that's what's wrong!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where this tale turns kinda sad. Let's rewind the time to late 2016. The said MFP is around 3 years old at the time, has printed several hundred thousand pages, and only once required unplanned maintenance due to a roller failing early which was bad from the factory. And that was it. We in IT barely noticed we even had that machine, despite it seeing plenty of use.  \n\n  \nThen came the day when some departments switched rooms within the building and we were ordered to move the machine elsewhere. Et voilà, in the elevator and up a floor it went an hour later. So now it was surrounded by a whole new set of users.   \n  \n\nMere days later the tickets started coming in as if floodgates were opened and the aforementioned tons of error messages appeared. From one day to another a machine with a perfect record turned into a downright IT support nightmare. Since then the following things happened, recurring several times each in random order: 1) Constant paper jams, machine halts every other print job. Reason: Finisher was dislodged from the unit, unplugged, parts broken off or blocked, usually after someone tried to \"fix\" a paper jam improperly and forceful. 2) Bad print quality overall. Reason: Foreign objects in places they don't belong, damaged rollers, sensors or fuser. 3) Smeared, repeating patterns on the paper. Reason: Physically punctured (!) transfer belt, as in \"holes manually punched into it\" with an object like a sharp pen or scissors. No idea how this could happen or how they even got to this part. 4) Paper jams, sheets come out crumpled, printer is smoking (!) or smelling funny. Reason: Paper was stored improperly and got wet during storage, humidity in the paper evaporated in the fuser, comes out crumpled. 5) Scanner not working, making terrible noise. Reason: Gearing badly damaged, someone engaged the transport locking mechanism while it was running. 6) Prints on the wrong paper. Reason: Looked like a software issue, but turned out to be caused by users stealthily swapping the paper from one tray to another between print jobs, probably because they forgot they can change the paper type through the print settings for their job. 7) Doesn't receive faxes anymore. Reason: Does in fact receive faxes, but someone switched on the option to not print them but instead only save incoming faxes to the hard disk. Or unplugged the fax cord. 8) Printer doesn't print/scan/fax at all or doesn't show anything on the display. Reason: Someone opened a maintenance panel and flicked the main switch for the power supply off again, instead of using the ordinary power button on top of the machine to send it to standby.  \n\nAnd this is not even a complete list, just a few recent ones that I remember right now.  \n  \n  \n &amp;nbsp;  \n  \n\nAs you can see sometimes a printer causes constant issues not because it is a bad printer, but just because of who uses the poor thing, and how. New hires constantly bitch about this *beep*, *beeping* piece of *beeping* *beep* printer being broken or misbehaving again... but they don't see the bigger picture. *I* know what you're going through, printer, I know... and hope people finally have mercy on you.",

        "text": "Many times I have wished upon the IT gods that we all respect and adore for a miracle or some visage of an unknown god to appear and pound into the concrete heads of managers (users would be a pipe dream) how encryption works.\n\nThe following is not for the faint of heart.\n\n---\nCast:\n\n$tjt - Yours Truly\n\n$vt - Vendor's Tech\n\n$vm - Vendor Tech's Manager\n\n$im - Internal Manager\n\n$IS - A representative of the venerable internal information security group\n\n---\nOur story begins **after** setup with a vendor. Pleasantries had been exchanged along with public keys (PGP), sFTP information for our file exchanges and everything was going grand. Until the vendor asked what they should do with our private key. (Just to clarify, they generated a private key to decrypt our files, and have already sent us the public key. We have even exchanged files daily for around 2 weeks).\n\nThe powers that be have decided that this is a quandary that must be solved by a (gasp) meeting. Enter meeting #1, attended by $tjt, $vm and $im.\n\n**Meeting #1**\n\n&gt; $vm: So, what would you like us to do with your encryption key?\n\n&gt; $im: Well, just in case something happens don't you think it should be backed up?\n\n&gt; $vm: I agree, but we don't usually store our client's key. Would you like to have it?\n\n&gt; $im: Definitely! It took us so long to set this up that I'd like to make sure that we don't have to go through it again\n\n*$vm seems totally OK with this, which makes my brain explode a little, so with reluctance I speak up...*\n\n&gt; $tjt: I'm sorry, but that would be completely insecure. If something happens can't you just generate a new key?\n\n&gt; $vm: Well, yes, but it would take some time. This is your key though, shouldn't you have it?\n\n*$tjt goes through a brief existential crisis.*\n\n&gt; $tjt: Please keep the key private. It is a private key and should not be shared with anyone. This would compromise all of our data we send to you.\n\n&gt; $im: I think we should really keep a copy of that key, just in case\n\nAt this point I'm completely done with both of these users.\n&gt; $tjt: Well, I'm afraid that it's an info sec requirement, so I'm sorry but no. It would not be secure.\n\nBoth managers back down and I naively thank the IT gods that this issue has been resolved. Enter a new email the next week from $im, calling meeting #2 to discuss the same topic. This time $vt and $IS are invited too.\n\nThere is palpable relief that $IS is on this call, since I knew he was at least a little more technical savvy than $im and $vm, and would definitely have my back.\n\n**Meeting #2**\n\n*$tjt and $vt are early, and start discussing the issues...*\n&gt; $tjt: So, I need to get this straight. We are encrypting files with the public key you gave us, correct?\n\n&gt; $vt: Yes\n\n&gt; $tjt: So giving us the private key would make this insecure correct?\n\n&gt; $vt: Well, we seem to have gotten a request to store this key, which we don't usually do, so we're having this meeting to find out what to do with it.\n\n&gt; $tjt: Your application is decrypting the files successfully right?\n\n&gt; $vt: Yes, that's not the issue. Apparently someone on your side is requesting that we keep the key in storage.\n\nI finally clue in that $im has requested that the key be kept somewhere else than the application in case it needs to be restored.\n\nThe rest of the attendees arrive and more pleasantries are exchanged until...\n\n&gt; $tjt: So, $im, why do we need to have this key stored?\n\n&gt; $im: Well, what happens if they lose the key?\n\n&gt; $tjt: They will have to generate a new one...\n\n&gt; $im: Doesn't that mean we should have it just in case?\n\n*I hold my silence long enough to let $IS chime in*\n\n&gt; $IS: Well, we can't have it transmitted over the internet, so as long as it's transmitted in a non-digital format or over the phone we should be OK with that.\n\nEveryone other than $vt seems to agree this would be worth thinking about.\n\n*$tjt's mind begins imploding.*\n\n&gt; $tjt: We are talking about over 2000 (2048 to be exact) letters, numbers and symbols. You can't possibly think that it would be accurate or secure over the phone!\n\n&gt; $vt: We could use an encrypted USB drive and ship it to you.\n\nI finally pull my last card.\n\n&gt; $tjt: How long would it take for you to generate a new key $vt\n\n&gt; $vt: Around 1 day\n\n&gt; $tjt: That's how long it would take us to ship the drive back to them $im. We would gain absolutely no time and risk all our security for no benefit whatsoever.\n\n&gt; $im: Oh. Well. I guess if it ever happens we'll just have them generate a new key?\n\n&gt; $tjt: Sounds good. Everybody's ok with this?\n\nEveryone agrees, $im takes over the ending pleasantries and I take an early day to recuperate my addled brain.\n\nIf you leave a graphic that easily explains public private key encryption I will post it on the wall by my desk and email it to every manager I know. F.M.L.\n\n",

After the first few calls it all came back, like riding a bike, and I was rolling like I never left the call center.\nDuring the end of the shift I get a call, a reasonable sounding guy that tells me \"Hi, I can't connect to the Internet. It says there's no signal. But, it's only this computer, my phone works fine.\".\n\nI'm actually surprised that I didn't need to fish this information out of him, and seeing on my dashboard that, indeed, his Internet is up and I can remotely manage his CPE and see other devices connected, I decide to trust him.\n\nSo I immediately think it's a WiFi issue, maybe a bad channel, try fiddling with some settings remotely and ask him to check again.\n-No, still no signal.\nI try different stuff, still no signal. Change his SSID, still no signal. Reboot his CPE, no signal. Ask him to reboot his computer, no signal. His phone was working this whole time, he managed to connect to the new SSID and everything.\nI'm starting to take this personally and decide that even though I'm way over the appropriate handling time already, I'll keep at it.\n\nSo I start asking him to give me info about his computer, he tell's me the make and model, an older Dell, and I ask what OS he's using. This is the turning point.\n\n-Oh, I'm not sure what OS it is. It's Windows I think.\n\n-Yes, but what version of Windows. Is it an older version, maybe Windows 7?\n\n-No, no, can't remember at all.\n\n-Could you please click on the Start button and tell me if there's a search bar there?\n\n-No, I can't. I told you I've got no signal.\n\n-Yes, but this doesn't require a connection to the Internet.\n\n-Well how do I do it?\n\n-You just have to click on Start...\n\n-But I've got no signal.\n\n-Yes, you don't need signal for this...\n\n(LOOP FOR 5-6 TIMES)\n\n-But I already told you, I've got no signal.\n\n-And because you've got no signal you can't click on the Start button.\n\n-Yes, that's what I've been telling you.\n\n-Sir, what exactly do you see on your screen right now.\n\n-I told you already, no singal.\n\n-So you're looking at a black screen with a box in the middle that says \"No signal\"?\n\n-Yes...\n\n-Sir, your monitor's cable is probably unplugged.\n\n-Really?! How can this be, I didn't change anything.. oh you're right, it is unplugged.",

She was not very willing to learn it, because she herself said she was too old to learn it.\n\nBut.. as it turned out, she got everything she needed to now, and sent **Steve** away.\n\nAnd it worked everything fine for a couple of months, until **Steve** got a call from her:\n\n&gt; **Lady**: Can you come over please, i think i broke the coffee cup holder of my computer?\n\n&gt; **Steve**: What?? What do you mean with coffee cup holder?\n\n&gt; **Lady**: You know.. the coffee holder. Just come over.\n\n**Steve** really didn't know what's going on and drove over to the hospital.\n\nAfter he arrived at her office, he started laughing.. the CD drive of the computer was ejected and had crack in the middle.\n\nSo apperently the **Lady** used the CD drive as a coffee holder for about 6 months, until it got too much and broke down.\n\n\nNow comes the crazy part.\n\nThe **Lady** was so embarrassed by this, that she sent him away and didn't want to call him again, if she had any trouble..\n\nOne year later, **Steve** got a call from her, asking if he could help her fix some network database error on her computer.\n\n**Steve** was again confused about what she's talking about now.\n\nHe drove to her, and was shocked.. the **Lady** was so emberrassed by the CD drive story, that she decided to really learn how computers work.\n\nSo she even learned how to write macro codes in Excel, so that she could build a database with basic informations, that were accessible from every computer in the hospital.\n\nExcept one she needed help with. But **Steve** had to pass, since this was even too complicated for him.. he only teaches basic informations.\n\nDon't know about the lady now.. maybe she isn't with us anymore. But her story tells us one thing: You can learn everything if you're just willing enough.\n\nEdit: Changed some \"wrong terms\"; I know Access is for databases, but try to show that to a noobie..\n\n\nTL,DR: An old lady was so embarressed for mistaking the CD drive as a coffee holder, she decided to learn computers and outsmart the tech support.\n",

        "text": "After spending the last six months reading [the compleat best of TFTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/wiki/index#wiki_the_compleat_best_of_tfts) on my lunch, I figure it's time for me to give something back. I'm not IT, but there's a couple stories I have that you guys might enjoy. So, to the LTLFTP machine!\n\nMany moons ago, I worked in customer service for a HVAC company. When people had furnace/air conditioner/water heater problems, they called me up, and then I did a bit of quick and dirty troubleshooting, booked them a technician, and tried to cross-sell them on our \"protection plans\" as a going-away present. So, it's a nice pleasant summer evening, not too warm(about mid-20s Celsius/mid-70s Fahrenheit, which will be relevant) and a call comes in. \n\n&gt; $Me: Thank you for calling $Company, how can I help you? \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: Why isn't your technician here yet? \n\nNow, like most companies with field techs, we booked in multi-hour windows. We were better than some, but it was still a 4-hour window - it's just not practical to book smaller when any job could be five minutes or three hours. So, I was used to this sort of complaint. But I must say, I wasn't used to a grown woman crying on the phone as soon as I picked up. And I don't mean a bit of sniffling, I mean full-out bawling. She sounded like she was probably 60-something, and she was crying like a baby, talking around the tears. *For the whole call*. (I don't mean to be insensitive, but in a year and a half at the job, nobody else ever did anything close to this, and it threw me a bit.)\n\n&gt; $Me: Oh dear, let me help you. Can I get your information, please? \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: $info\n\n&gt; $Me: Thank you. Let me see what's happening...\n\nI look at her file, and there's nothing. No appointment booked, no call note from any other rep, just stuff from years earlier. Ugh. \n\n&gt; $Me: I'm sorry to say that I don't see any appointment booked. Let's see if we can book you one now, okay? I'll get you that technician as soon as possible. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: (crying intensifies)\n\nThe part I hadn't told her yet is that she was not going to be having a good night. Our last appointment block of the evening was 8 PM-midnight, and she called at about 9:50 PM. We can't book appointments for any window once the window has started - our policy is to book them for the soonest available(which would be the next day sometime), and then we can send scheduling requests to a queue of constantly over-harried dispatchers who get asked for earlier appointments 916123 times per day and never give us any feedback on anything. And even they close at 10 PM, so if I don't get this lady settled down, troubleshot, and booked for an appointment really soon, she won't even have that option. \n\n&gt; $Me: Can you tell me what the problem is? It might be something we can fix over the phone. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: There's a bunch of water coming out of my furnace! It's flooding everything!\n\nThis is a pretty normal problem - water condenses on the cold A/C coils(which are inside the furnace), and it's supposed to drip into a pan and then drain, but the drain can clog up sometimes. The amount of water is never *that* much, it's usually kept well away from any electronics, and it's easy enough to work around it - mop up the water, either turn off the A/C or keep mopping occasionally, and don't worry too much. So hey, problem solved, right? She'll get an 8AM-noon window tomorrow(I was checking it as I was talking), she can fix it until then, and we're golden. \n\n&gt; $Me: Okay, that's one you should be able to fix. Your air conditioner is leaking - if you turn it off, then the water should stop pretty quickly. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: But it's hot! \n\n&gt; $Me: It won't be for long, we can get a technician out there first thing tomorrow\n\n&gt; $Oldlady: (cutting in) TOMORROW?! I was supposed to have someone tonight! The last person said you'd send someone out right away! It's been an hour, where's the technician?\n\n&gt; $Me: I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way. We can't book techs that quickly, especially not at this time of the night. I can book you that spot for tomorrow morning just to make sure you have something booked, and then see if there's anything else we can do, okay?\n\n&gt; $Oldlady: (crying intensifies)\n\n&gt; $Me: (books 8-noon appointment, gives her info about it)\n\n&gt; $Me: Now that we have that in place, let's see if I can get you a sooner appointment.\n\n&gt; $Oldlady: Well, can you?\n\n&gt; $Me: Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear - I don't give you those appointments, I have to send a request in to our scheduling department, who might be able to. I'm just typing it all up right now. They'll give you a call if they can do anything, okay? \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: (crying intensifies)\n\n&gt; $Me: I'm sorry - I really am doing everything I can for you, because I know this is pretty unpleasant. Now, as I was saying, we might be able to fix this over the phone, at least temporarily. The water is coming from the air conditioner, so if you can turn that off, the water should stop and there won't be any more flooding. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: But it's hot!\n\n&gt; $Me: The house won't heat up instantly - it'll stay cool most of the might, because it's already cool. The water will stop, you can sleep without worrying about it, and the tech will be out early tomorrow morning to fix it for good. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: That's not good enough, it's too hot! I need my A/C!\n\n&gt; $Me: Okay, we can work with that too. The A/C still works, it's just leaking a bit. You can run it overnight, maybe lay down some towels or something, and then the house will stay cool. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: But it's wet!\n\n&gt; $Me: I'm really sorry, but there's only so much I can do here. The scheduling department will let you know if we can get a technician out tonight, and we'll definitely have someone out by tomorrow morning, but I can't fix it over the phone. I can only help you make it a bit better. If you run the A/C, water will come out. If you don't, then the water will stop, but your house will heat up some overnight. I don't know of any other options here. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: (crying intensifies)\n\n&gt; $Me: I am truly sorry that this is happening to you. I know it's no fun at all. But I can't do anything aside from what I've already done. \n\n&gt; $Oldlady: I want to talk to your supervisor!\n\nNormally, I dislike supervisor transfers - the \"supervisors\" in question are just regular reps stupid enough to accept a transfer to \"Customer Care\", they get paid even less than I am(they lose their sales commissions in exchange for a trivial bump to base pay), and they get abuse heaped upon them. But at this point, my patience was nearly gone for this lady, after 20 minutes of her crying in my ear(and I'm not normally someone who loses my patience in customer service). So sure, have a transfer. At this hour, they won't be able to do anything either, but good luck. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, one of the ladies from the \"supervisor\" end of the office comes over to talk to me. Apparently, the same thing repeated itself, and she eventually settled for turning the A/C down a bit in hopes of there being less water and still keeping the house kind of cool. And there was still no notes from the rep she'd spoken to an hour before me - as best we could figure it, someone probably said \"We'll get you someone as soon as we can\", and then she hung up thinking she had an appointment booked for that night. And the bitch of it is, we were quiet that night - if she'd actually stayed on the line, she probably would have gotten something, but it turned out to be too late by the time she called back. Sigh...\n\ntl;dr, The house was flooding, but more from her tears than from the A/C. ",

        "text": "This is going to be a familiar tale, but there was definitely an interesting twist.  \n  \nOne of my sites was having terrible issues with the network. Wifi stops being usable, desktops can barely get any data moving, IP phones going offline. Sounds like a backbone network issue. Sounds like network broadcast storm. \"But I thought STP should take care of this?\" Simply means I need to do my homework better, and configure storm/flood control and read up on how to properly configure network loop detection. But first I have to get the network back online the way it's supposed to be. So I grab a spare firewall (just in case), hop the train back home, fetch my car, head over to the site 45 minutes away. All while lugging a 20 lb 2U firewall.  \n  \nUsing the magic of ARP tables, MAC address tables, and summary port statistics tables, I identify some MACs that are strangely pointing in circles between switches, instead of ending at an edge port. Also took note of several ports with unusually high error rates.  \n  \nThen I saw it.  \n  \nOne port had over 400 MAC entries associated with it. Show CDP Neighbors revealed nothing. It wasn't another managed switch. What on earth -- this has to be a network loop.  \n  \nThe hunt begins!  \n  \nThanks to the switch labels, I knew what wing of the building to start the hunt. Out of 12 switches, there were only 3 in this part of the building. Somewhere along the way, the night concierge was kind enough to supply hot cocoa and a cookie -- which I promptly gave away to the CNA on duty, since I'm diabetic, but she didn't know that. It was a nice move on her part. Maybe she thought to impress the guy from corporate (that's me).  \n  \nHunting wabbits! And then I saw it. It was a director's office. Sure enough, there were two cables plugged into the wall jack, when typically should only be one.  \n  \nYep. The phone had its switch port and a PC port. Both went to the wall jack. Nothing went to the laptop docking station. The laptop was using wifi. But there's a cable in the docking station Ethernet port, what the...  \n  \nA phone cord. RJ11. Plugged into the Ethernet port (loosely) which ran to her MFP. I guess the cables were in the box, and she felt every cable must be hooked up somewhere, right? No, that cable did absolutely nothing. It's just meant to be a printer.  \n  \nTLDR: Don't hook up a useless phone cord to a network jack it didn't even fit properly, kkthx.\n",

I noticed it when I started there and went through the process of learning where everything was and what was connected to what and so on.   During this process I discovered the router was plugged into a DSL link but NOTHING was connecting the router to my network.\n\nOver the next few months I would walk into the LAN room and see the router and remember I needed to look into it further but other work kept coming up.   Eventually, as part of a cleanup project that I was doing I decided to just unplug the router and throw it in my drawer.\n\nA couple of months went by when someone called from a NOC to tell me that the router was inaccessible.   I asked them what it was supposed to be for and, while the could tell me that it was supplied by the government, that was it.   I got them to send me instructions on where to send the router and I returned it and asked them to cancel the DSL line and never heard from them again.\n\nFrom what I could figure, the government had been paying for a DSL line for 3 or 4 years that NO ONE WAS USING.\n\n\n\n",

Turns out the power cable was loose. Cool, fixed that. Second time same thing. Third time I figured out she was KICKING it by accident so I told her to be careful of where she placed her feet and if she needed I could put it on top of the desk instead of by her feet. Well, considering this is IT and nothing makes sense she said no it’s okay, I’ll just keep it by my feet and I’ll be careful. Fourth time today I get a ticket right when I walk in (not a morning person so it’s hard for me to fake happiness). \n\nI visit her and she’s working on the computer so I ask her “oh is it working okay now?” She says “ya but it wasn’t before”, with a nice attitude. So I say “okay no problem let me check that for you”. She hobbled off her chair and I check and yup the cable is loose for the FOURTH time. I tell her I have to move it up since she is accidentally kicking it and she flips out. “I KEEP TELLING YOU IM NOT KICKING IT, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE TOWER I NEED A NEW ONE.” She ends up calling her manager over and I explain that she’s kicking it and somehow it’s getting unplugged and she doesn’t want it on the desk. Manager asks me how I know all this. I said, “Might want to wipe all the footprints off the computer first before you call me” YUP, she had FOOTPRINTS on the side and front of it.

        "text": "I’ve deleted the intro to this story several times now—there are hardly words to express the amount of madness, desperation, frustration and despair I experienced over one month-long aircraft visit.  Reconstruction of all that went terribly, terribly wrong is actually fairly easy; at one point I had to prepare a timeline of events for The Powers That Be—thankfully due to my habit of archiving nearly everything, I was able to provide details nearly to the minute.  But even my timeline was insufficient because the following week things spiraled further out of control.    \n\nThis is the story of an aircraft check that even Murphy himself admits got a little bit out of hand.\n***\nI’ve mentioned before how I’ve transitioned from being a floor mechanic to a more planning and leadership oriented role.  I have to coordinate a large number of moving pieces and ensure I’ve orchestrated the aircraft maintenance visit to the optimal work flow and will be as unaffected as possible by potential issues.  So long as I have knowledge and information, I can adapt and overcome whatever gets thrown my way.  Thirty day maintenance visits have a lot of flex to absorb different problems.  \n\nAt least as long as I have the whole picture.\n\n###Day 5\nGlorious Monday morning.  I have my coffee in hand, sitting at my card table in front of the work center on display for all who enter and wish to view the report monkey in action.  I’m reading my emails and discretely tabbing to $TableTopGame discussion forums when my Company-Issued Leash warbles, demanding my attention.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Zeewulf.”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** “Hey, Zee…It’s Planning Lead at the Mothership.  Got a question for you.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Yeah?  What’s up?”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** “You guys haven’t removed the Thrust Reversers from that aircraft yet, have you?”\n\n*On this aircraft, the thrust reversers (abbreviated **T/R**) are large cowlings that surround the core of the engine.  Thrust from the fan is blocked by a series of ‘doors’ that open and redirect the thrust forward [as in this picture, for example.]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/F-GTAR_Air_France_%283698209485%29.jpg)*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Oh yeah, we got those things off back on Day 3.  ”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** “…I see.  I don’t suppose there’s any way you can get them back on?  Before midnight?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** *choking, drowning on coffee* “What?  No!  They’re back with the Composite Shop right now getting their life inspections.”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** “Are you sure?  We really need to get them reinstalled before midnight.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Why before midnight?  What’s going on?”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** “Well…tomorrow an Airworthiness Directive goes live for an inspection on those…and the project isn’t ready yet.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Wut.”\n\n*An Airworthiness Directive (abbreviated as* ***AD*** *) is a notification of a safety-of-flight issue in an aircraft model or system and requires correction.  Sometimes they give time limits or conditions to when the AD must be complied with, sometimes an AD will ground a fleet of aircraft.  It all depends on the severity of the situation.*\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead** We submitted to the FAA but they rejected our request for an Alternate Method of Compliance.  And it could be a month before they approve our resubmittal.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** *strained coughing, blood vessels protruding…*  “I see.  Well there’s no way we can get those reversers back on by midnight.  It’s physically impossible.”\n\n&gt;**$PlanningLead**  “If we can’t get them back on by midnight, per the AD we cannot put them back on until they’ve complied with this AD.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “…I think you better get an email going on this right now, including all the leadership.”\n\nThe planning lead acknowledged the request and hung up, while I immediately went to inform Management.  This was going to throw a very, very large wrench into the check. \n\nIt wasn’t until late in the afternoon before the Planning Lead finally sent the email, and soon a T/R Project Engineer (Let’s just call him $TRPE1) chimed in with some tooling part numbers.  Our schedule manager replied, asking if the project was even opened (that is, able to be worked by maintenance) yet by the engineers.  $TRPE2 chimed in and said that no, in fact it was still in development.\n\nI went home at this point and tried to tell myself it was all going to work out…\n\n###Days 6-9\n\nFirst thing in the morning of Day 6, $TRPE1 asked if we’d gotten the T/Rs reinstalled on the aircraft.  I explained once more that no, it would have been impossible to do and we were pretty much up AD creek without a paddle.  A few minutes later $PlanningManager jumped into the email thread and asked why on earth this wasn’t addressed until the day before the AD was due.  $TRPE1 swiftly threw the Planning Group under the bus and explained that he had notified the planners three weeks prior.  It wasn’t until $PlanningLead came screaming down with everything on fire that they actually started Doing Something.  \n\nDay 7 saw our own on-site engineers  suggesting they would be willing to write up some specialty Engineering Repair Authorization (ERA) paperwork for us to actually comply with the AD…if the actual Fleet Engineering group to whom the $TRPEs belonged couldn’t deliver on their promises.\n\nDay 9, the deadline for which our Local Engineers were waiting to leap into action to save us, arrived and with it Fleet Engineering came through to save us all with actual honest-to-goodness work instructions.  Even better, they would be sending another engineer, $TRPE3, to work with us on Wednesday of the next week.  \nCrisis was averted, and all would be well!\n\n###Day 12\nNary a peep disturbed my Leash all weekend and I enjoyed a fun family event.  Arriving that Monday morning I felt confident, happy, and even hopeful about the execution of the check.\n\n&gt;**$ProjectContractor**  “Hey, Zee, odd thing here.”\n\n$ProjectContractor was one of several assigned to modify the Landing Gear Computer system, per another AD that had been issued some time ago.  He seldom ran into issues, so I thought it strange he would come to me first thing in the morning.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Yeah?  Whatchya got?”\n\n&gt;**$ProjectContractor** “The paperwork doesn’t match what’s on the plane.  It’s asking me to attach a wire to a grounding stud that doesn’t exist.  We submitted an engineering request, but they’re not responding.”\n\nThis too was significant.  The thing about AD paperwork is there are no deviations or changes allowed. If something doesn’t jive, it’s a big deal and needs an engineer to sort out.    Of course, here’s the rub.  You need to know which engineering group to contact.  Normally you only have to deal with our local engineering or fleet engineering.  This plane, however, was receiving several modifications, so we also had several project engineering groups involved, to include an interior engineer group and a [Very Special Work (VSW)]( https://redd.it/77fdb6) engineering group.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Which engineering group did you contact, and when?”\n\n&gt;**$Project Contractor**  “Oh, Saturday.  We sent an email to $InteriorEngineer.\n\n*Whoops.  More often than not, #ProjectContractor dealt with $InteriorEngineer, but on this particular mod Fleet Engineering was the contact, as I would soon learn.*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Ah, see, that’s your problem first.  We need to notify someone else.  Don’t worry, I’ll contact our local engineers and they’ll let us know who to talk to.”\n\nAnother problem handled, my day would go smoothly.  Local engineering referred me to the Fleet Engineer, (Landing Gear Enginer, $LGE), who then, long after my work day had ended, requested confirmation of the issue.   \n***\nI went home that night and slept the fitful sleep of a new parent, but still confident that things would stay under control.  Meanwhile, someone on the overnight shift removed a bolt incorrectly and without lubrication…..",

He said there was a fire at the office, and I might want to come in and see what was going on.\n\nSo I did.  By the time I got there, the fire was on its way out, and I and a couple dozen others were standing around in the parking lot waiting for the firefighters to give us the all-clear to enter the building.\n\nWe had Internet service through an awesome local ISP at the time.  The kind of small company that really cared about service.\n\nWhile I was shivering next to a fire truck, my cell phone rang.  It was one of their techs, whom I had shared on office with at a different company years ago and knew well.\n\n&gt; Me: Hello?\n\n&gt; Tech: Hi, this is $TECH from $ISP.  Just wanted to let you know that our monitoring noticed your Internet link is down, and we're working on it.\n\n&gt; Me: That might be because it's on fire.\n\nLong pause.  Then:\n\n&gt; Tech: Did you just say it's on fire?\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, there was a fire in the building.  I'm standing next to a fire truck right now.  They aren't letting us in yet.\n\nThen, without missing a beat, $TECH said something he *never* said at that ISP (remember, premium service):\n\n&gt; Tech: Ah, well OK then.

He had really high tech audio equipment, a little usb controller for a dj software on his laptop, a multi channel mixer the size of a standard pc tower (on its side).\n\nAt one time he cursed his equipment because something didnt work. Apparently he couldn't open the dj software. He already restarted the pc 3 times, had the task manager running.\n\nI just stood there because I'm shy and don't want to get the hopes of people up and then disappoint them. Until my mate announced that I am an informatics guy.\n\nSo I had no choice. I started troubleshooting. The software worked earlier that day, so it shouldn't be a general invompability. He said that he switched some drivers in the settings of the software though, before he shut tge lsptop down until the party setup. Driver problems are complicated, so I put that on the lower end of my troubleshoot.\n\nThe software would show a completely black splash screen and the just freeze, so I figured it's waiting or searching for something.\n\nI asked wether he always had internet when he started it before. So my buddy made an LTE-Wifi hotspot, but the software wouldn't work. I checked google for people with the same problem and found none. Literally nobody.\n\nI asked if he had the installation files for his software on his pc. (Would be clever, since he works with it and things happen). He didn't. So a clean installation was no option.\n\nThe next best thing to a clean installation is resetting the settings, so I went into his appdata folder (ofc I used win+r and typed %appdata%, which kinda established that I know pc magic). I found the settings file, moved it to his desktop and after that, the software would open instantly. I then opened the *.settings file and deleted the driver settings and moved that back to appdata, so that he had the other settings he made. It did not work as expected, the software made a second settings file and didn't accept my butchered frankenstein.settings. \n\nBut the settings werent needed anyway. He could use the software and he was happy. And that's how I saved our party. The alternative would have been winamp.",

        "text": "[Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7c4n3n/oceans_31_part_1/)  \n\nHave you ever browsed the tech gore subreddits? I have. It's fun to point and laugh, and to reassure yourself that as bad as your current annoyance is, at least it's not *that* bad.  \nSilly naive me. I never thought I'd run across anything in the wild that qualified. Alas, NDAs.  \nTo start with, the infrastructure side of the room looked like the Flying Spaghetti Monster had misspoken, and gotten its 40+ virgins in the form of Cisco switches. Not a single Ethernet or fiber cable was shorter than 10 feet, and the cable hiders served to reveal more than conceal. A handful poked out at random, unplugged.  \nThere was no rhyme or reason I could divine as to the layout. Absolutely nothing was labeled. I could barely identify at least four different brands of firewall and two cable modems in some poisonous daisy-chain of five-port switches. They weaved back and forth to the punchdowns on the wall and some electrical junction-box looking equipment mounted next to it.  \nThe other half of the room was dominated by a cluster of locked server racks. At least there was an overhead rail keeping most of it out of trip-hazard range. There was exactly one monitor in the area, off to the side on a shelf, the VGA cable dangling.  \n\nNow I realize this might be somewhat anticlimactic. But this was closing time on a Friday evening, and my first task - upon which everything else I was doing was dependent - was to cut off the internet but leave the rest of the infrastructure intact. I couldn't even tell how to do that. In short, I felt like I did looking at BGP for the first time. Tired, frustrated, confused, and *completely* out of my depth.  \n\n$Link smiled a bit ruefully when he heard my outburst. I should have been expecting this really; while $Ganon had a proper office with five monitors, $Zelda appeared to be working out of a computer lab, and $Link's \"office\" was a cubby in the back of a tech purgatory, where semifunctional equipment went to die.  \n&gt;**$Extension**: Okay, I'll bite. Which one's which?  \n**$Link:** I have no clue.  \n**$Extension**: Wat.  \n**$Link:** $Ganon always handled that....$Zelda might have a better idea.  \n\nA few minutes later, we waded back in, this time with both $Zelda and $TheAncientOne in tow.  \n&gt;**$TheAncientOne**: Damn. You've been here what, eight years? How long did it take to get this bad?  \n**$Zelda**: Oh, it was like this since the beginning.  \n**$Extension and $TheAncientOne, simultaneously**: *What.*  \n**$Zelda**: Yeah. I believe the main controller is this guy here?  \n\n$Zelda gestured to a firewall brand I hadn't worked with before. *(I had, however, seen their SysAdmin Day videos, as have many of you.)*  \nI tentatively traced what cables I could. Multiple were going to the 99 Switches. A handful of others were going to the 5-port switch bouquet to the side, including the one from the port labeled \"WAN\". After some trial and error, we determined that the internet was dependent on two different cables and left those unplugged.  \nI retreated to $Link's corner of the graveyard, and returned to my list. We'd had a remote employee unplug the modem at the primary branch location (thankfully, their closet wasn't the same level of fustercluck). So my next task was to go over the firewall configuration and try to identify any \"vulnerabilities.\"  \nIn keeping with the rest of the evening, that wasn't a simple task either. $Link and $Zelda's credentials weren't working. It supposedly synced with AD but none of that was working either. To save time, I moved on to the rest of my checklist, and to no one's suprprise most of the answers I got were \"Sorry, $Ganon always took care of that/never told us that/never documented that.\" Thankfully that wasn't the case with the wireless or the phone system.  \n*Sidebar - where are your priorities if you drop so much money on multiple ISPs and firewalls but still host your phone system on a Windows 2000 box, that in the normal scheme of things might have had access to the internet?*  \n\nBy this point I'd reconvened with the rest of the team. $Link and $Zelda had gone home, since they'd told us what little they could. The firewall was still an issue, as we didn't dare turn the internet back on until we'd had a look. $Steve had half-heartedly called the vendor before being stymied by the autoattendant. I'd finished what I could besides that, and was ~~dicking around on my phone~~ trying to find some way in without breaking the thing.  \nThen I came across an article in their knowledgebase and realized how absolutely stupid I'd been. I grabbed my kit - including that stupid little USB to serial adapter - and ran for the server room.  \nI'll admit, I was shaking a bit as I plugged the thing in. Euphoria, because that might mean the end of this night's labors. Shamefacedness, because I'd missed something so incredibly obvious. And nervousness, because if I screwed it up we were likely without either backups or documentation of even basic functionality.  \nIt was a little more involved than the Cisco process I was used to, but it did the trick. After resetting the console password, then the web access password, we finally got in. The interface left something to be desired, at least to us, but we were able to maneuver our way to the firewall rules and nuke the \"CIO home access\" policy.  \n\nAround 9 or 10 we called it quits for the evening. $Steve and $Lemonade were to come back in the morning to bring the internet up again, and to assist $Zelda in any incidental issues. (Including the org-wide password reset we were recommending.) I would head up to the branch location and reset the firewall password there, since it had the same issue and enough equipment to justify it being a target. Security escorted us out and I took the long drive home.    \n\nThe branch office was an hour or two away from the main site, so I ended up riding there with one of our contacts, $Impa. It was a surprisingly pleasant drive - we stopped for ~~white girl trash~~\"coffee\" on the way up, and chatted about everything from cats to Star Wars. Occasionally we'd delve into the situation at hand. She was hopeful $Link and $Zelda would take the opportunity and step up. I emphasized that priority number one *had* to be documentation, because they now had a teetering pile of infrastructure and it was only a matter of time before things started failing. Figure out what goes where, how, and *why* first, *then* you can clean it up.  \nChanging the password itself was anti-climactic, though a slightly different process. I finished and called $Lemonade to verify connectivity.  \n&gt;**$Lemonade**: We might have a problem.  \n**$Extension**: What, it's not coming up?  \n**$Lemonade**: Remember how they have a hybrid setup for their email?  \n**$Extension**: I don't like where this is going. Did we ever figure out *why*?  \n**$Lemonade**: Something something phone integration most likely. But the on-premises side of things isn't connecting.  \n**$Extension**: But we got the internet back up and everything!...right?  \n**$Lemonade**: Yup. But the connectors aren't - well, connecting.  \n\nI finished up and we headed back to town. Along the way, I learned two things about $Impa I hadn't realized until I heard her last name. Number one, she was the CEO; number two, she'd served in a handful of positions in city and state government, a couple of them quite recognizable. I think I even voted for her once.  \n\nWhen we got back, $Steve was calling Microsoft while $Lemonade tried to get a hold of the firewall vendor. I poked around in the interface trying to assist, but the most we managed to narrow it down to was that a secondary WAN IP was assigned to mail functionality, and it wasn't responding or routing. $Lemonade and I went home while we waited on Microsoft to call back.  \n$Steve called me a bit later.  \n&gt;**Steve**: So guess what it was.  \n**$Extension**: You got it?  \n**$Steve**: You know how there were multiple firewalls in the closet?  \n**$Extension**: Wait. A Kansas City shuffle?  \n**$Steve**: In a sense. Apparently one of them grabbed that IP after the main firewall rebooted.  \n\nThe firewalls were booted in the correct order, and the spice flowed once again. We left the Tri(Quad)Force of Overcomplication to $Link and $Zelda. $Steve, $Lemonade and I retreated to our respective video games, and $TheAncientOne went to watch his favorite sportsball team lose to his hated rival. We may or may not have given him shit about it.",

Each of them was asked if they need help with plugging it in or taking care of the old one - most of them said they can handle it, some of them not but they ususally called for help eventually (which was totally fine with me).\n\nBut there was this one lady, the corpo-bitch style. Always high heels, always pristine make-up and clothes and speaking in a manner like she was the queen of her suburbs. And of course you first smelled her parfumes and then saw her. It was easy to determine if she was passing by in the last 10 minutes even if you're not a trained police dog.\n\n\nAnyway, she comes to pick up her brand new LCD Dell monitor. I'm asking as usual:\n\n&gt;- Hey, you'll need any help with that?\n\n\n&gt;- You think I can't handle such a simple task? I didn't get this job for nice looks.\n\n\n&gt;- Umm... sure ok, just call us if any assist is needed.\n\n\n&gt;- Pfff\n\n\nThe next day The CB is storming into our office and says that she *demands her previous monitor*. \n\n&gt;- Umm, it is somewhere in the IT-shack but why would you need that?\n\n\n&gt;- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO COPY ALL MY FILES SOMEWHERE BEFORE THE SWAP OR I CAN LOSE THEM!\n\n\n&gt;- No... it's impossible.\n\n\n&gt;- Yeah? You think so? So come and see for yourself. And give me back my f* monitor.\n\n\nWell, so I went over to her place to see what the hell could've happened. And so I see her monitor in 1028x768 resolution overcrowded with icons like a club on a Saturday Night.\n\n&gt;- Ok, so I've asked you if you'll need any help and **you've said no**.\n\n\n&gt;- *brlahg bghhh lalgllgghgghhgh* (basically spitting out some stuff about her being the most competent person in the existence of human kind and my fault that I didn't warn her about the data loss)\n\n\n&gt;- **switching resolution to native** So your files are still there, next time just say that you need help with the setup and we'll help you.\n\n\n&gt;- Just go already and let me get back to my work.\n\n\n\nYeah, and so it is. In the meantime she also said that maybe we don't want to give her the monitor back because we're stealing the data to sell it to our competitors. Sure thing, one cent per kilobyte on papertowels and plastic cups usage. Did I mention that she was just a team leader for a maintenance team?",

        "text": "I used to work in IT for a mid-sized company that had an office and a shop area.  Among other things, our office had one of those giant old Canon ImageRunner multifunction printers.  And it was old - it had probably done a million or two more pages than it was designed for.  It broke down regularly.\n\nOne guy, I'll call him Alan, was an older guy and often surly.  He came in to work at 5:30 and needed to print.  Inevitably when the printer failed, he'd have been stewing in anger for a while already when IT people came in at 7 or 8.  We all had to walk past his office to get to ours, and he would loudly express his frustration.\n\nWe'd have loved to get rid of the printer too, but just couldn't get budget for it.\n\nOver time, I got promoted and eventually became head of IT.  (One side-effect of being a manager: all the most annoying complaints get escalated to you.)  Alan would then particularly single me out for yelling whenever the Canon was broken.\n\nI'd suggest using the newer printer upstairs.  \"That's ridiculous!  I shouldn't have to do that!  This printer should be fixed!\"  It had a maintenance contract with a Canon dealer, and I'd promise to call them.  \"Oh, just like you did last week?  They're shit.  Here we are again.\"  (They were shit, but it wasn't their fault this time.)  I had told him many times we hated that thing as much as him, but couldn't get budget to replace it.\n\nFinally one morning I walk past Alan's office.  He was even more steamed than usual about the printer.  He yells at me, \"What on earth are we going to do about this printer?\"\n\nI had just about enough of the printer and Alan.  Somehow his comment triggered a vague memory of a BOFH episode (probably [this one](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/05/19/bofh_tracks_down_arsonist/)).  So I made a suggestion.\n\n&gt; Alan, here's how you can permanently fix the printer.\n\n&gt; Oh really?  What do I do?\n\n&gt; You know what the fuser is on a printer?  That thing with all the scorched-looking \"caution: hot\" labels on it?\n\n&gt; Yeah, I've seen them take the thing apart.\n\n&gt; OK, so here's what you do. Go find some old rags in the shop.  Soak them in oil.  Lots of oil.  Do know where that oil vat is?\n\n&gt; Oh yeah, I can do that.\n\n&gt; OK.  Then you stuff those oil-soaked rags tight around the fuser and send a 10,000-page print job.  You'll get a new printer, and the rest of the office will get the day off once the fire trucks leave.\n\nSilence.  Alan just stared at me, processing.  Then he got a big smile, started chuckling, and said, \"You know what?  I have a whole new respect for you now.  Have a good day!\"\n\nHe had NEVER wished me a good day.  Alan still complained about the printer to others, but from that day until the day he retired, he left IT alone about it.\n\nEpilogue: That printer eventually got replaced -- by a Canon competitor that had the good sense to turn in an even more expensive quote than Canon did.  More expensive because it also included a smaller *color* laser printer for the CEO's office (nobody else had color lasers in the company back then).\n\nDisclaimer: both Alan and I understood the rags to be a joke!",

        "text": "Hello beautiful folks of TFTS, I hope your morning is going well and that the pot of coffee is brewed and hot for enjoyment! I just wanted to share some family tech support stories!\n\nFirst involves getting Netflix up and running on the family Smart TV (which is a OK and decent smart TV for its time. I think my folks got it around 2011-2012ish, its a LG smart TV that is 1080p @60hz with 3D support if you got the glasses that weren't powered I think)\n\nI launched the app to sign out of whatever account it was defaulted on and I get a error code saying it couldn't sign out of the account it was connected too. So I asked the almighty google for guidance on how to solve the issue and the lord said to me that for my model smart TV that is discontinued and no longer supported was to do a factory reset and sign back into the network and login to my Netflix account. \n\nmy brother and stepdad were cool with the factory restart since we had nothing on the TV in the first place. Once the TV reset itself, we got it connected to the network and signed into Netflix. They asked how I figured it out and told them to speak with the loving almighty google for which it knows most of the answers for the questions they seek.\n\nAnd for my next tale is showing my brother how to use his phone as a hot spot when the internet went down for a bit. \n\nLittle brother was filling out a job application for a job he was applying for and the internet cuts out. Que him running to me like its the end of the world since the internet went out, I told him to calm down and take his phone out because I was going to save his bacon. \n\nI told him that since he was on my family plan that he had access to 8GB of mobile hot spot since I had the unlimited data plan. (my carrier is boost mobile for those wondering) I walk him through the steps of getting it setup and he was able to fill out his job application. (He got the job BTW.) He then asks me how he connect his 3Ds to the hotspot and I told him to repeat the same steps he did to connect his desktop and he was connected. \n\nso far that is all I for today for short stories, Ill post more once I have the time to!

        "text": "So, this is a bit of a cliche type of story but this happened this morning. And felt it needed a special place somewhere on the Internet! Not the most exciting but it got my heart racing. Just of note U1 is high up within the company.\n\nU1/2: = User(s) - D: = ME - \n\nI was attending another call in the building just fixing a PDF issue, when the phone rings for the colleague next to me.\n\n&gt;U2: Hey U1, how you doing?\n\n&gt;U2: *random conversation and pause* Are you alright?\n\n&gt;U2: You've spilt what?\n\nI immediately stop what I'm doing, and look up in full meerkat mode.\n\n&gt;U2: Has it gone on your laptop? *wait for response* Turn it upside down!\n\nI wait for her to continue her version of tech support.\n\n&gt;U2: Well D is here, do you want me to send him up.\n\nHer phone call ends.\n\n&gt;D: *not wanting to know the answer* Who was that? What's happened?\n\n&gt;U2: It was U1, he's spilt water all over his laptop.\n\n&gt;D: Oh God...\n\nMy phone starts ringing, it was another high up member basically telling me that U1 has spilt water all over his laptop, I tell her I'm aware and I'm on my way. I make excuses to the actual person I came to help and run upstairs.\n\nWhen I'm upstairs I see U1 in the doorway of another director's office, holding his LITERALLY dripping wet laptop. I take it from him and take it to his office.\n\nI open the lid, water is still on the keyboard itself so I dry that up, turn it upside down and remove the battery, water again, bubbles from under the service cover, I start drying what I can from here.\n\n&gt;U1: It was an accident! I got some hot water in a cup to warm my hands up and just knocked it over accidentally.\n\n&gt;D: Alright...what happened when you got water on it? Is there anything important on it?\n\n&gt;U1: It just turned off straight away *crap I thought* and there's some pictures on it that I need *double crap*\n\nI turn the laptop on after drying it up, fans instantly go to full speed and the caps lock light starts to flash *triple crap*\n\n&gt;D: Right I'm going to have to take this down and have a look from my desk.\n\n&gt;U1: Ok...when do you think it'll be fixed?\n\n&gt;D: Erm...you spilt water onto a live laptop, I might not be able to fix it.\n\nI was getting frustrated because I'm constantly having to tell people not to keep liquids near their devices, especially the laptops.\n\n&gt;U1: Oh...well do we have a spare?\n\n&gt;D: I'm not sure, I can have a look when I go downstairs.\n\nI knew I had a spare one but didn't exactly want to shout about it! I get downstairs, quickly get him setup and onto our terminal server.\n\n&gt;U1: Let me know when you get the laptop fixed, could do with those pictures!\n\nI don't say much as that made me slightly angry and I head downstairs again to try survey the damage.\n\nEvery component or piece of casing I take off I find more puddles of water, the keyboard is soaked, the DVD drive, the main board, the only thing luckily that managed to avoid being drowned was the HDD so I remove this and get the files off it (being the good little techy I am!)\n\n&gt;D: Hey U1, I've managed to get those pictures off the laptop and things, but it doesn't look good for the laptop itself.\n\n&gt;U1: Oh...well thanks for getting the pictures, and for what it's worth I'm sorry!\n\nI'm surprised he said sorry in all fairness, not something that usually happens, the user taking the blame for it!\n\nSo here I am, with a stripped out laptop drying out and crossing my fingers something magical happens with it! Although I really doubt that it will happen as the errors I'm getting point to system board failure.\n\nSmall victory is it's an old laptop...I guess that's a victory?!\n\nTL;DR - User brought liquid substance into contact with laptop, expects miracles to get it working again.

(I've been called a junkie by my doc, which made me laugh till I threw up 4 days in a row and got really concerned. Heh.)\n\n\nAnyway, let's do part 6!\n\nNew to the story? Missed a part? Here you go!\n\n[Part 5 - The war of the $bosses begins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/79k4b0/the_war_of_the_bosses_begins_why_use_sql_we_got/)\n\n[Part 4 - Yeah, I can do that.

We got Access!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/708mxo/why_use_sql_we_got_access/) \n_________________________\n\nThe characters:\n\n$boss: 30ish woman, and man, could she be a dragon. (A nice one, but still a dragon.)\n\n$coworker: nice 40ish go-to-woman. Got a question? Ask $coworker. Biggest help on my project so far.\n\n$bigBoss: the uber-boss. 40-something, comes from Greece, has an accent and is chilled like no-one I've ever met.\n\n$newBoss: By then, I lost overview a tiny bit. He's another boss, but not the boss of $boss, but still pretty important? I never figured it out.\n\n$ITwannabe: The IT guru. Though how much he actually did in IT and programming, I never found out. Was not much, that I can tell.\n\n________________\n\n\nSo here I am, trying to fuse a lot of stuff into my application which I do not want in there, making links and corrolating data. I give it my best - I truly do - but it still sucks. By now, I am already way behind the planned schedule; $boss had me make another updated one and it does not look good in any way. I am now about a month behind what I am supposed to achieve.\n\n\n$boss is also back by now (finally!) and has me do another round of data reflection. She comes up with the phenomenal idea that if a lot of the key values in our data source are the same, I should search for other key values. In this case - dates. So what I do now is to try to get only the \"newest\" entries into our database and have us work with them. Problem is, I still have not figured out a nice flag to get the right project data into our DB, since the meatgrinder does not give even a tiny fuck about my problems. He is a meatgrinder, after all - he takes everything, munches it up and vomits out an incredible mess, which is all and every project ever conceived in this here department.\n\n\nMy solution: Have the application copy everything (since it is way faster in Access to just copy the data into a temporary table and work with that than to try to request the right values one by one from the DB) and mess around with that. By now (which is about one week later), I only have a few duplicates left - since they have the same dates.\n\n\nWhile I do this, $newBoss starts harrassing me. He wants this, he wants that, and he wants it NOW. He is still nice about this, but I gather from the flood of emails he is sending me that he gets impatient.\n\n\nTime to load the dragon.\n\n\n&gt; $me: Hey $boss! I got a little problem here.\n\n&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free! Sure, what's up?\n\n&gt; $me: See, the problem is $newBoss. He wants a lot of stuff in the application, it really slows me down. Not only do I still not have the data he wants, but every time I have a few fields implemented, he comes up with a few other ones.\n\n&gt; $boss: All right, I'll have a talk with him.\n\n\nYeah, I still have no data for $newBoss. $ITwannabe has shot me down a few times by now, saying that he will get around to me the moment he has some spare time from his project (which, I remind you, is more or less the same as mine, but way more fancier and with a few people working on it instead of just poor ol' me.) I am getting frustrated by now.\n\n\nSo, the same day, $boss pays a little visit to $newBoss. I can hear the screaming coming down the floor when the dragon unfolds her wings and starts breathing fire all over the place. As any man with a sense of self-preservation would do, I keep my head down and just continue working.\n\n\n$boss comes around an hour later and tells me not to worry about anything, just to get on with my job and finish the application so we can finally start testing. All of testing up to this point has been done by me and $coworker, but since the application is supposed to be deployed in the whole country, we need to do some additional testing about connection and stuff like that.\n\n\nA few minutes after $boss has left, I get another mail.\n\n\n&gt; Dear $win4free,\n\n&gt; These are the new fields I need: *yaddayadda*. Please disregard the fields *moreyadda* since I will not need them.\n\n\nDear RNGesus. This is the fifth time he has me include fields which one day later he does not want anymore. Seems he is fire-proof, too.\n\n\nI ask $coworker to bring the good news to our dragon overlord (yeah, I am not the bravest person - time to throw another person to the fiery fire) and a few minutes later, the heat is on.\n\n\nI get another email. Meeting with $bigBoss.\n\n\nSeems like our dragon overlord has applied to our Greek dragon emporer.\n\n\nI come in a bit early as always, and $bigBoss greets me with a big smile.\n\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Hey $win4free! How's it going? How are you doing in school?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Fine, thanks. Know what this meeting is about?\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Nah, just about some dispute between $boss and $newBoss. But that's talk for later. My kids! They want to study, too, so tell me a bit about this computer science thingy you are doing.\n\n\nWe drink coffee, I tell him half of my life story, we laugh a lot. Then the bosses arrive.\n\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: So, tell me what this is all about.\n\n&gt; $newBoss: Well, the application has a lot of data I need and -\n\n&gt; $boss: No it doesn't, it does only if $win4free keeps adding field after field for which we still have no data available!\n\n&gt; $newBoss: Well, YOU told me it wouldn't be a problem!\n\n&gt; $boss: A few fields, yes! Not a shitton of them!\n\n\nThis goes on and on. I sit right across to $bigBoss, who, from time to time, sips his coffee and lets the show continue with every sign of enjoyment. Also, from time to time, we exchange a glance, smirk and sip some more black programming soup.\n\n\nFinally, the Greek dragon awaiks.\n\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: All right, settle down. $win4free, tell me your side of the story.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Well, it's like this: I am already behind schedule. The more I have to implement, the longer it will take to roll out the application. Simple as that.\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Right. $newBoss, how much more stuff will you need in there? Oh, and have you finished the matrix, $win4free?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Yeah, matrix is almost finished.\n\n&gt; $newBoss: I don't know, really. My guys come up with other stuff from time to time -\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Well, than make sure to gather all the other stuff, thin it out, only get what you need, and send it to $win4free when you have everything.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Biggest problem still is the data itself. I have no chance to get to it. $ITwannabe is heads deep in his own project and cannot assist me, really.\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Well, than $newBoss will have to fill it out himself.\n\n\nI smirk.\n\n\n&gt; $newBoss: How much would that be?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Well, we're counting about 50 projects so far.\n\n&gt; $newBoss: And I have to fill out every field I request?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Yah.\n\n\nThe Greek dragon smirks.\n\n\n&gt; $newBoss: Okay... yeah, I better thin out them fields.\n\n&gt; $bigBoss: Great! Back to work, then! Oh, $win4free, do you have a few more minutes?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Sure, whatever you need.\n\n\nWe continue drinking coffee and talking about studying for about half an hour in which $bigBoss starts venting about his son, who does not seem to have any clue what to study, just that he wants to study *something*. When I return to my workplace, $coworker gives me an upraised eyebrow.\n\n\n&gt; $coworker: So, how did it go?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Guess we'll have a lot less emails from now on.\n\n___________________________________\n\nStill interested?

We're technically not really supposed to offer support for personal devices, but we do because we still get paid and like to be helpful.\n\nThe issue was that the laptop couldn't connect to the university Wi-Fi - but it could connect to other networks. The second issue was that the user was Russian, the laptops language was set to Russian, and for some bizarre reason it couldn't be changed.\n\nLuckily my desktop was running the same version of Windows, so I just compared menus to navigate. I tried the usual fixes - turn Wi-Fi off and on again, reset the adaptor, remove the profile and configure the connection from scratch, reboot - nothing worked.\n\nEventually I just uninstalled the Wi-Fi driver and rebooted, under the impression that windows would automatically re-install it - which it didn't. I then had to manually get the driver on my machine and install it from a USB.\n\nEven retrying the above steps after this didn't fix the issue. It would connect just fine to the guest and setup networks, but refused to connect to the main uni network, and apparently her own home network.\n\nAt this point, myself and my colleagues gave up and suggested she find third-party support.\n\nThe strangest issue I've yet seen on the job.",

Watch a movie with the wife after the kids go to bed and asleep around midnight. \n0200(ish) – Duty phone rings.\n \n*crap*\n\nAnswering it I hear the auto message saying there is an alarm in the server room. Fifteen minutes later I’m out the door and on the way to base. I badge into the compound, then the building, then the outer server room and finally I’m putting in the combo to my department’s server room. As I open the door, something is wrong, but it takes me about 30 seconds to figure out that it’s the sound of silence that’s disturbing. \n\n*fuck me*\n\nThe lights come on as I open the door, but all the server racks are dead. No humming, no fans, nothing, dead silence. Twenty minutes later I’ve called the facilities manager, the IT lead for the organization, my supervisor, the other military guy and our contractors. It’s “all hands on deck” time. \n\nIt’s several hours of facilities figuring out what happened before we can start powering our servers back up and making sure we didn’t lose any data. About 1500 we’re finally good to go for the day. \n\nAfter Action Report: \nDuring a thunderstorm on Friday night power had been temporarily disrupted to the building at which time the generator kicked on. Power for the lights had been restored but apparently the servers were still running off the generator, until about 0100 Sunday morning when the diesel went dry, then the UPS kicked in for about an hour before they died and I get the auto call. The outcome of this was the generator was mod’ed to auto-call the Facilities manager when it was kicked on.  \n\nOld shitty warehouse converted to office space/server room + lazy incompetent facilities section + thunderstorm = fml. \n",

Awesome community in every aspect.\n\n\n\nThis story happened a few months ago, here are the characters:\n\n\n\n$me: me!\n\n\n$f_m: family member\n\n\n\nThis family member invited me to his house to dinner, we eat together frequently so nothing out of the ordinary, plus he is not really tech savvy but can manage his way through common issues all by himself. He always carries his phone in his pocket, but not this time. It was really weird, so I asked\n\n\n&gt;$me: Hey, where is your phone?\n\n\n&gt;$f_m: Oh don't worry about it, its... malfunctioning\n\n\n&gt;$me: Do you wan't me to check it?\n\n\n&gt;$f_m: Nah... let's just eat, dont worry\n\n\n&gt;$me: Come on! let me see if I can fix it\n\n\nHe brought the phone and the screen was cracked, nothing major. The phone in question is a Huawei without a case, so I knew it would happen sooner rather than later. \n\n\n&gt;$me: So, whats the problem?\n\n\n&gt;$f_m: Well... everytime I try to use it, the phone automatically opens my email and goes through my recent mails, I tried deactivating Wi Fi but it reactivated itself again! So I just turned it off, I mean, I can live without the phone.\n\n\n&gt;$me: What the...???\n\n\nI grabbed the phone, turned it on, left it for a while and mail app opened all by itself, and also the first email, the screen kept going up and down a few pixels.\n\n\nI tried deactivating Wi Fi, and it reactivated, exactly as told. I feared the worst for a moment.\n\n\nI turned it off, gave it a few minutes while I was thinking. Rebooted it and it went for the mail app again! but this time it took more time. Weird... \n\n\n&gt;$f_m: It all started last week, about the same time the screen broke\n\n\n&gt;$me: What happened?\n\n\n&gt;$f_m: Well, I encountered an old friend in the street, he gave me the strongest of hugs and I heard a crack. The button in my shirt's pocket must have cracked it.\n\n\nI looked at the phone, the mail app was positioned in the worst part of the cracked screen... but that couldn't be it right?\n\n\nI opened the Wi Fi menu, the activation toggle was in the exact same spot! \n\n\nI dragged the app mail icon a row down and waited.... Nothing happened. Dragged the gallery app to the same spot... The gallery opened! and the picture that was in that spot opened shortly after.\n\n\nI toggled developer options in his phone, enabled pointer location and clear as day: there was an unwanted and irregular pressing in that spot that sometimes made a dragging gesture. He changed the phone shortly after that, with a case and a screen protector.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Cracked screens don't hack devices\n\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: it didn't occurred to me that the tittle could create confusion with rule 7 (as the story doesn't contain any hacking at all), sorry about the confusion! I will be more careful\n\nEdit 3: pressing, not pressure. Smartphone screens sense the pressing via electricity, not pressure",

        "text": "This was from several years ago. We produce custom desktop software for customers. These particular customers were especially tech illiterate and didn't even have an IT department to speak of despite being a major manufacturing corporation (anonymized, but you've heard of them for sure).\n\nOur software is nothing super crazy: download our run-of-the-mill installer, open it, and click next a few times and you're done. Sure, there are advanced options but most people would be fine with the defaults.\n\nSupport had a problem with three people trying to install. No amount of \"click next\" was getting through to them. They were seriously questioning the advanced options they thought they had to set, and talking them out of changing the defaults was an exercise in futility.\n\nThem: It is asking for a path to install.\n\nSupport: Just leave it be. Click next.\n\nThem: But what do I put for the path?\n\nSupport: What is it set to now?\n\nThem: See two dots diagonal line program files diagonal--\n\nSupport: That is the correct path. Click next.\n\nThem: But I should set the path, shouldn't I?\n\nThis circular conversation went nowhere... Finally, the customer had a great idea.\n\nThem: \"Can you send someone out here to help us?\"\n\nSupport: \"The nearest person is 500 miles away.\"\n\nThem: \"We will pay whatever expenses it takes. We just have to get this thing installed before tomorrow.\"\n\nNext thing I knew I was boarding an airplane bound for their city.\n\n2 hours later I was at their office... 20 minutes after that, hitting next a total of 6 times (3 for each luser), I was done. The application worked fine. They drove me back to the airport where I came back home that night.\n\nThe only good thing was they dutifully paid the thousand-odd bucks for the flight plus premium hourly cost.\n\nTL;DR: Customer spent &gt;$1,000 to have a qualified tech do the equivalent of hiring a mechanic to unlock your car using your key.\n\nEdit: To the repeated comments suggesting we use Team Viewer or something similar: how do you expect us to walk them through setting that up if we can't even get them to install this?",

        "text": "Context: I am one of 7 university students living in a shared house. I guess I am the only computer literate student, doing a degree in game dev so while I'm not ***exactly*** tech support, everyone turns to me for \"computer stuff\" because they are mostly art and design related students. I'm not more a technician other than the fact I seem to have a bit more \"computery intuition\", but that is enough for them I guess.                    \n&amp;nbsp;            \nSo our household has one router to cover 3 floors of an old victorian era house with nice thick brick walls. I lived on the ground floor and everyone else is split between the middle and top floor.             \nI notice that I have repeated wireless dropouts and an overall terrible connection so I go to investigate and find our WiFi router is set to dual band with a single access point. I figure that in the past when living at home splitting the dual band to the separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz access points worked a treat so I would do the same here. I explain to my housemates that I will be splitting the WiFi to two access points for stability purposes, and that they should join the 2.4GHz access point for stability or the 5GHz access point for higher max speeds but only if they do not experience interference issues which should be anyone living on the middle floor.              \n&amp;nbsp;                             \nAll but one seem to be onboard. Lets call the house mate who was not onboard **$HM1** who lives in the room where the wifi router is next to his bed.                 \nI separate the WiFi to two access points, lo and behold my connection is finally stable and even a bit faster.                \n&amp;nbsp;          \nThat was a couple weeks ago...       \nUp to this point I have heard absolutely no issues from anyone until today.              \nI will paraphrase the conversation that just went down on the facebook group chat for out house.                  \n&gt;**$HM1**: I can't use the faster WiFi on my wifi speaker because it cant find it, can you put the wifi all back as one?              \n&gt;**Me**: I would rather not, have you googled your speaker make &amp; model to see if there are reported issues with 5GHz?          \n&gt;**$HM1**: Well [other housemate]s speaker can't find the faster wifi either.             \n&gt;**Me**: Then use the 2.4GHz access point, it isn't exactly a slow connection (60+Mbps down)                \n&gt;**$HM1**: If it isn't slow then putting them back together wont change much.             \n&gt;**Me**: I have found dual band to be way less stable in my experience.             \n&gt;**$HM1**: Well its all of our wifi, not just yours              \n&gt;**Me**: ... which is why I separated the access points, because my connection was unstable and getting frequent dropouts.           \n&gt;**$HM1**: \"So we all get a slower WiFi so you can enjoy a faster one\" [Direct quote]                \n&gt;**Me**: I should never have explained the 5GHz access point as \"the faster one\", at our speeds the difference between 2.4 and 5 is unnoticeable. Can you not just join the 2.4GHz access point on your speaker and stop being a dick about this.                  \n&gt;**$HM1**: I'm not being a dick, I cant connect to both, if you're going to split them why cant you make it so I can connect to both the \"slow and fast one\".               \n&gt;**Me**: It is done properly, you don't know what you are talking about.             \n&gt;**$HM1**: *\"Well if it’s don’t properly, why cant some devices find the 5...\"* **Remember this quote for the end of this OP**                        \n&gt;**Me**: I am forced to split it so I can get a stable connection at all, you don't understand how the WiFi works, I am not being unreasonable here.          \n&gt;**$HM1**: \"It doesn’t matter if I understand it or not, my point still stands\"                   \n&gt;**Me**: So I have to make my WiFi unstable just so your speaker can connect to a single dual-band access point.             \n&gt;**$HM1**: \"I’m not saying you have to put it back together, I’m asking you to sort it so we all have the ability to join either\"            \n&gt;**Me**: ***Sends photo of him specifically asking \"can you put the wifi all back as one?\" ***               \n&gt;**$HM1**: That was literally the first message                       \n&amp;nbsp;            \nThen another housemate who lives on the top floor chimes in...               \n&gt;**$HM2**: Well since you have changed the WiFi it always throws me off and I've had to use all my mobile data the last few days.               \n&gt;**Me**: Were you on the 5GHz or 2.4GHz access point?                \n&gt;**$HM2**: 5              \n&gt;**Me**: FFS, why.             \n&gt;**$HM2**: Its been doing it a lot over the last week.            \n&gt;**Me**: I explained the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz, you should be on 2.4GHz if you are experience dropouts and interference.               \n&gt;**$HM2**: Oh okay.                  \n&amp;nbsp;              \n&amp;nbsp;            \n\n\nAt this point, I log onto the router and rename the 2.4GHz access point to the original name that the dual-band access point had, and just hide the 5GHz access point under a different name, and then tell the house group chat that the 2.4GHz access point is set back to dual band, and none of them will know or complain again I bet.             \n&amp;nbsp;             \nYou know what the real kicker is though... I asked $HM1 for the make and model of his speaker that \"couldn't connect to the fast wifi\" because *I set it up wrong*...                \nI googled his speaker model as I told him to do in my first message and his speaker doesn't even support 5GHz wifi connections.                    \nWell **$HM1**, enjoy your forever 2.4GHz connection from now on.",

        "text": "Strap yourselves in, this one’s fun. *Also my first multiparter woo*  \n\nNear the beginning of last week, $Steve flagged me down after a meeting with $TheAncientOne.  \n&gt;**$Steve**: Sorry, but you’re getting dragged into this, per the boss.  \n**$Extension**: *Fick mich*. What pageant did you all get yourselves involved with this time?  \n**$Steve**: Remember $Bert?  \n**$Extension**: *Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.*  \n\n$Bert was a tech for one of our client companies, that we were brought on to replace. They offered him a deal: keep him on retainer for 90 days, for any questions and such, and get paid for the time, plus a decent reference. He ended up taking it, and we're glad he did, as nothing was documented and their setup was far more complex then it needed to be. I'm still dealing with servers named after Star Wars planets, and the ~~TW Telecom~~ ~~Level3~~ CenturyLink contract they got locked into.  \nHyruleCo was a local company I had passed before but never interacted with. As far as I knew they weren't a nonprofit either. But they were terminating their CIO and had....concerns about security and operations in the aftermath. I'll call him $Ganon.  \n$Link and $Zelda were junior staff, but more responsible for other smaller segments of their infrastructure - mostly database stuff - as $Ganon was a wee bit territorial. The plan was, $Ganon gets called into a meeting at end of day, we slip in and disable all the things, then hand off to the two techs and call it good.  \nOf course it wasn't going to go that simply - we all knew that. So as we planned we tried to come up with a comprehensive list of everything that needed changing. Complicating matters was HyruleCo's suspicion that he had been monitoring their communications to some extent - behavior seemingly in response to things he shouldn't have known about, like the very meeting our boss had with them.  \n$Lemonade was tasked with assisting in securing their website, and ended up volunteering to come on-site with the rest of us. We made a very lovely three caballeros.  \n\nCut to D-Day and we're getting antsy as we prep for battle. I can't find my USB to serial adapter and end up running out to buy one, on the off-chance I would need to hard reset a router. $Steve's quizzing $Greybeard for details on Exchange, apparently they have a hybrid on-premises/Office 365 environment. $Lemonade's securing both their registrar and host on the off chance he tries to breathe on DNS.  \nWe leave the office around the same time, after agreeing to a QT run. Pull into the parking lot at the same time, inadvertantly, which $Lemonade commented made the whole thing feel very Ocean's 11. We all nab snacks, anticipating a long night.  \nFinally, we pull into the parking lot around 5pm. It must have looked odd from the outside - four cars parked next to each other, still running, everyone on their phones. We hang around for a bit before $TheAncientOne gives us the signal that $Ganon has been pulled into his meeting. Security escorts us inside and we're introduced to $Link and $Zelda, who look surprised but not shocked. After the briefing I'm led over to the server room to shut off the internet. They buzz me in the door, flip the lights on -   \nAnd I drop my professional demeanor along with a couple of F-bombs.  \n\n*Next time on Dragon Ball Z: You don't have to be a helicopter pilot to know someone's fucked up when you see one in a tree.*",

If this isn’t appropriate here, tell me.  \n\n\nI am currently a senior in high school and intending to study computer security in college. As such, I’ve been known as one of the “tech support” guys at my school, both by staff and students. Here’s a short conversation I just had with one of my best friends during lunch (paraphrased):\n\n\n&gt; $BF: Hey $Poke, sorry I'm late. I was attempting to fix my computer.\n\n\n*Suddenly curious*\n\n&gt;$Poke: What's wrong with it? \n\n&gt;$BF: It died on me. When I turn it on, it shows the Black Screen of Death.\n\n\n*Black screen of death? You mean a Blue Screen of Death?* \n&gt;$Poke: What do you mean?\n\n&gt;$BF: You know, when it has the spinning wheel that goes on forever.\n\n*So it won't boot. Huh.*\n\n&gt;$BF: I'm glad it lasted this long though! Windows Vista was like a rock ever since I got it from my dad in 2009!\n\n*I visibly cringe in pain at this. Also, how TF did it last this long?!*  \n\n&gt;$BF: What did you make that face about?\n\n*I take a deep breath*\n\n&gt;$Poke: Vista is known to be incredibly unstable, as it was really a rushed Windows 7. It's been terrible for stability, especially in business.\n\n&gt;$BF: But it worked for me!\n\n&gt;$Poke: Amazingly it did. In addition, Vista is no longer receiving any updates from Microsoft.\n\n&gt;$BF: So THAT's why Norton can't update! Either that or the fact that it says that it's been \"expired\" for over 1000 days.\n\n*Oh god.*\n\n&gt;$Poke: There's a possibility it could of gotten a virus, and maybe that's why it's not booting.\n\n&gt;$BF: I don't think it got a virus. If it did, I would have known about it. Stop making me nervous!\n\n*Seriously?*\n\n&gt;$Poke: Besides, if it got a virus, there are plenty of USB recovery tools to bring it back. Alternately, the hard drive can be probably removed and plugged into another computer. The data can be transferred to the computer it's plugged in from there.\n\n&gt;$BF: I hope something works. I might lose all of the work I've made since I was a little kid!\n\n*Internal realization that there are no backups for 10 years worth of data.*\n\n&gt;$BF: I've got to get to my next class now. Bye!\n\n*Wondering what kind of mess I just got myself into*\n\n\n\nMoral of the story: Beware the friend's computer.\n\n\nTL/DR: Friend says they have computer that doesn't boot. After a conversation, I find out that's only the beginning of the rabbit hole.\n  \n\nEDIT: Apparently Vista became more stable after SP1 and SP2.",

OK, what are you seeing right now in your browser window?\"  \n**User**: \"Well, I did what he said and now there's a big box with all my websites listed.\"  \n**Me (somewhat confused)**: \"Sir, what did he tell you to do? What is in your address bar right now?  It should have the website that you normally see when you're using the software.\"  \n**User**: \"It just says 'L8'\"  \n**Me (really confused at this point)**: \"And what did the other tech say to you before he transferred you to me?\"  \n**User**: \"He said he wanted to escalate the problem, so I pressed the 'Esc' key, the 'L' key, then the '8' key.  Should I press them all at the same time?\"  \n**Me**: \"Sir, do you mind if I put you on hold for a couple of minutes while I consult with our engineers?\"  \nI don't even wait for an answer, I just hit the mute button.  You know the feeling.",

        "text": "Background: I work at my college's helpdesk\n\nRecently I was home for the weekend, which means that if any of my family members needed computer help I was available. My mom told me that my grandma was \"having issues with her computer\", which can range to it not turning on, to her forgetting her email password. She also somehow went through 3 laptops in one year, don't ask me how\n\nSo I went over to my grandma's house, and lo and behold, she forgot her online banking password. She hands me her laptop, and her desktop looks different\n\nLike, very different. Like, not a windows desktop different\n\nTo confirm my suspicions, I do CTRL+ALT+T, and there it is, a terminal. Somehow, she was running Lubuntu on her laptop\n\n&gt;$me: Grandma, why are you running Linux?\n\n&gt;$gran: What's that?\n\n&gt;$me: Your laptop, it doesn't have Windows, it's running a thing called Linux. How did that happen?\n\n &gt;$gran: I don't know. I took it to the shop in town, and they told me something about windows errors, and this is how I got it back.\n\nI didn't get a lot of details but apparently she was having issues with it, and took it to the local computer repair store. For whatever reason, their fix was to uninstall Windows and install Lubuntu.\n\nI got her banking password reset and was on my way, but I think its kind of nice that I'm not the only one in my family running Linux, even if they didn't know it",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, here's a short story I just saw happen and thought you guys would enjoy:\n\nAs I arrived to the office this morning, I noticed the meeting room was occupied by our resident client guys (people contracted by our client, not by my employer), all gathered round a particular laptop and our IT guy working on it. After a while, the laptop owner ($RC) called their own IT and the following syncopated dialogue ensued:\n\n&gt;$RC: So yeah, we got it downloaded but the IT guy said he can't access the admin account to install it!  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;$RC: No, we're not at $MultinationalBeerCompany HQ, we're at $MultinationalBPOCompany HQ!  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;$RC: Look, my IP is $IPAdress, can you remote it?  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;$RC: Why can't you if I'm connected to the internet?  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;$RC: Ugh, okay, bye.  \n\nAnd then he turned to the rest of the guys and said:\n\n&gt;$RC: So, they can't fix my laptop because the IT guy from $MultinationalBPOCompany says he doesn't have permissions on my laptop and $MultinationalBeerCompany IT helpdesk said they can't remote my laptop because I'm not in $MultinationalBeerCompany internal network! Ugh, I hate dealing with IT\n\nCouldn't help but think, not to worry, sir. IT also hates dealing with you",
