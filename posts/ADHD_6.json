        "text": "TLDR: Having a 504 plan is ruining my mental state but my mom and therapist are extremely pushy about me keeping and using it, how do I convince them that terminating my 504 plan is a good idea?\n\nI've used my accommodations like 5 times at most, and it was mainly last year when I was at a terrible school full of completely out of control students that I couldn't be around without getting overwhelmed and start dissociating. This year, I'm at a different, much better school so I don't really need them. And even when I actually do need a separate setting for testing (which is the only accommodation I've ever used), I don't do it because the proctor for the separate setting kids has infantilized me so much every time I've done separate setting that now I'd rather lose my mind and not be able to focus in my normal classes than have to be around her. \n\nBut also, I hate the fact that my ADHD is acknowledged by the school and my teachers know about it. And by hate, I actually mean that I'm completely petrified that when they find out I have a 504 plan they'll start treating me differently. I just got done sobbing out of panic and fear because my annual 504 meeting was today and my mom told me that all my teachers were there and gave their input about how I'm doing, and I'm scared shitless that tomorrow I'm gonna walk into my classes and my teachers are going to start infantilizing me and acting like I haven't been fully capable of doing everything, understanding everything, and being mentally older than 5 since they've known me. And I'm saying all this knowing that they all probably have a hundred 504 meetings a year and never really think about it or do anything differently.\n\nI'm so paranoid about being treated differently that now I'm reading into what my mom said my teachers said about me. My chorus teacher said I was super intelligent and my knee-jerk reaction was to think \"oh so does she think that it's some accomplishment for someone with a disability to be smart?\". And a lot of my teachers said I was quiet so when I heard that of course I thought \"they probably think it's because I have a disability so I'm weird and quiet. And they probably think that's why I still wear a mask too\".\n\nAnyway, my mom was talking about how I should really use my accommodations when I need them, and I started getting kind of defensive. She said \"No one gets defensive about needing glasses and this is basically the same thing so idk what your problem is\". And that right there is enough for me to scream. It's not the goddamn same and the last 3 paragraphs, as well as experiences I haven't mentioned here, are proof of it. \n\nStruggling in school is so worth it if it means I don't have to deal with this level of anxiety and fear just about the school acknowledging my disability. And I know, I'll want it for big tests like the SATs/ACTs and I'll want it for college, but I straight up don't care. I'll crash and burn my way through it all and it'll be a million times easier than feeling how I currently feel for the rest of my school career. And I'm not even struggling right now. I'm not using a single accommodation and I'm completely fine. All I'm struggling with is your average \"math is bullshit what are these hieroglyphics\" type stuff. That's not caused by ADHD, that's caused by me straight up not understanding math and not studying it as much as I should be.\n\nSo how do I get everything I'm feeling across to my mom and therapist, because they're both VERY pushy about me using my accommodations, despite me saying that I don't need them. No matter what I say, they just respond with \"oh but in the future you'll be happy you have it.\" Yeah, maybe. But it can be reinstated and right now I'm extremely unhappy having it and would definitely benefit from not having to deal with it.",

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nI’m 22f. I’ve been a longtime lurker of this sub. I didn’t want to engage until I knew for sure I have adhd. Unfortunately, after being assessed, my psychologist said I don’t have adhd and diagnosed me with asd, depression, anxiety, cannabis use disorder, and insomnia. I already had a previous diagnosis of asd and depression. \n\nDespite explaining my symptoms and writing a 2-3 pages letter of my struggles and symptoms, the only thing he took out of my letter is that I had previously brought up adhd to my psychiatrist who declined to diagnose me with it. So in his report, he’s making me seem like I’m seeking a diagnosis of adhd and am trying to get it from anywhere.\n\nMy worry is he was also reluctant to diagnose me with adhd because of my honesty about my cannabis use (therefore, possibility of stimulant abuse). But I truly don’t think it affects any aspects of my life. In fact I think it makes things better. As mentioned, I have autism so it’s hard for me to understand or even verbalize what I’m feeling. Getting high really does help me understand myself. Aside from that, I think he took it as I get high all the time but I only smoke once or twice quarterly.\n\nAnyway, I just feel like he totally disregarded everything I struggle with and everything I mentioned in my letter, and based off his impression only on the tests performed, which by the way, I think may have been skewed as I am taking Wellbutrin, used to also treat adhd. I told him I’m taking Wellbutrin and despite having that knowledge, he decided against factoring it into my assessment. \n\nI just think it really means a lot to me to get an adhd diagnosis because I lost my dad a little over half a year ago and there were several things I could’ve done to help him. To get the medical care he needed. I know people who might’ve been able to help him, or at least know someone who could help us. But I kept putting it off. I kept saying oh tomorrow I’ll reach out to them and see what they can do. But I never did. And it just went on like that for weeks of rolling things over to the next day and then the next day for months, until he died. I would just get stuck in that cycle. And never do anything. And I think that just goes along with time blindness. Like I never realized how much time had gone by. How many days, how many times I put it off. And of course there’s more than just that but I just feel so guilty. Like if it’s not adhd, then it’s just me. I won’t have anything else to blame it on but myself. I’m just feeling so entirely misunderstood and since I got the report back this morning I’ve been feeling incredibly down. I spent $1,100 to be told about things I already know.",

I’m not really depressed and I wasn’t feeling anxiety like I was feeling when I took adderall. but to be honest I’d only feel that way when something was going on in my life that was affecting me like my break up or just some bs. \n\nBut I am considering taking adderall again but I want to know if there’s any natural medicine or over the counter medicine that can help me.

For the past 3-4 months it’s been getting progressively harder to go into and stay at work.

It almost feels like, while there is literally nothing keeping me from working.. I just can’t. I’ve never been able to not provide for my family and I’ve never been able to not work.. I feel like I’m going crazy..\nI got diagnosed with ADHD in September 2022, and am currently on methylphenidate 54mg ER with a booster of methylphenidate 20mg instant release. Some days it feels like it helps me finish the day at work and other days it feels like I’m more focused on getting ANYTHING else done but work. \nHas anyone ever dealt something like this or maybe have any advice for me?

The mixture should be consumed*\n\n*immediately and not stored for future use. Neither food (a high fat meal or yogurt) nor*\n\n*orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmax of dextroamphetamine in healthy adults*\n\n*after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of Vyvanse capsules.

I’ve still forgotten my meds a few times but the rate at which I’ve taken them has vastly increased. Not only that, but the ability to go back and notice which days I was medicated and which days I wasn’t and to then compare it with the outcomes of the day is an incredibly effective tool. Another helpful feature is the default notification sound is unique. It uses the sound of a pill bottle being shaken which helps immediately distinguish it from normal notifications. If I hear that rattle, I’m reminded of my meds. Oh yeah, and this is all from the free version. The premium adds some features that are more situationally useful and some fun aesthetic changes but it is still a very valuable tool without paying.\n\nHaving trouble taking your meds or remembering which days you took what?

While this is a good thing, I feel stressed because my hours have been cut down to the bare minimum (part-time, 15 hours) and I'm sure wherever I'm placed it will end up being the same situation because of limited positions in the area I'm living in. \n\nThe next step in the bank is to get your mutual funds licence so that you can move into a sales role and become a financial advisor. I'm really not too excited about moving into this role as I will have to do a lot of client outreach and building relationships, which is daunting for a person like me who is struggling with feelings of inadequacy. \n\nOn the other hand, though, I'm pretty well received at work, and I do see that it's not going to be as bad as I think if and when I do move into that role. My biggest obstacles right now are the self-imposed deadlines and questions that I keep replaying in my mind. Is it right for me? Am I ready to study for and write the exam to get my licence? Can I do it soon, as summer is approaching? Even if I get my licence, will there be a job for me? Will I have to push bank products and be aggressive to hit quotas? \n\nThey are valid questions and concerns, but it's not helping me in the day to day because I feel completely paralyzed and have not taken action on studying for the exam even though I have all the materials and the time to study for it. I did really poorly in university because of my undiagnosed ADHD and I think those feelings are keeping me from taking any steps for this new role.\n\nI'm living paycheck to paycheck and want to increase my income and get more hours and I know it all won't happen in a day, but if I keep picking reasons for why it won't work, I'll be stuck here for a longer time or I may have to start looking for another job in another field entirely and I don't think that's going to be any easier. Job hunting sucks and it fills me with so much anxiety, and starting all over, again, would make me so upset. \n\nSo, my questions are:\n- How can I get started on studying?\n- How can I trust in my abilities to know I am right for the job?\n- How can I remember all the successes and hard work I've put in to have a better quality of life than a few years ago so that this next phase of my life doesn't seem as daunting?\n- How can I stop comparing myself or forcing myself to compete with others?\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to discussing with you in the comments.\n-",

In the past year I have had a lot of therapy to deal with my symptoms and I have switched jobs.\n\nIn my current job I have to read letters that we get from clients, decide which department they need to go to and send them there. We have a set goal of reading 50 letters per hour, most of my colleagues can read 70-80 letters per hour but I am just not that fast.\n\nI have asked them for tips how to get faster and I really try to be faster but no matter what I do I can't read more than about 50 letters per hour. This has caused a strain between me and my colleagues because they feel like I am getting special treatment because I'm allowed to be slower since my boss knows about my ADHD and they feel like I'm lazy and slacking off. I have tried several times to tell them that I'm not lazy but they dont believe me and now I dont know what to do.\n\nI am thinking of taking medication because it might help me focus more even though I really dont like taking medication. But I just dont want my colleagues to be mad at me. Does anyone have any advice in this situation?",

Worse, if I am to say what are the things that truly give me pleasure, that would be drugs and sex. Nothing has ever come close to giving me that sort of satisfaction. I have a job, a good one by all counts, intellectual work, and I deeply dislike it. I only engage with mainstream society for ethical considerations. I feel I owe society for the privileges I am given and should give back. All I do is out of social obligation. \n\nIf I could do what I want, I'd want to only have sex, take drugs, and die at 40. I actively dislike doing things step by step to achieve something in a few years. Once I do achieve that thing, which I occasionally do, I absolutely do not care in any way. \n\nObjectively things are not bad. I am moderately successful, have tons of friends, no issue with relationships. I have a partner. I've had people who wanted to build their life with me and who I loved. \n\nBut, I fully want immediate pleasure. Nothing else comes close. Is this something that can be fixed? Can I train myself to want and appreciate long boring projects? Or should I just embrace that those are the only things which make me happy?",

        "text": "I’ve been wondering: how many of us also suffer from cyclothymia along with our ADHD?  You know, those fast-cycling mood swings, where the highs aren’t so high as to be classified as true mania, and the lows aren’t low or long enough to be clinical depression.\n\nI call cyclothymia “the quieter, gentler little sister” to bi-polar disorder.  Though cyclothymia can be quite disabling, it’s really more of a temperament than it is a diagnosis (though it’s in the DSM, but what isn’t at this point?). A psychiatrist I used to see told me once that it’s “an artistic temperament”.  I liked that. \n\nMy swings are very predictable, and I’ve had them my whole life, though I didn’t recognize it until the aforementioned shrink pointed it out to me.  I just thought I was moody, unmotivated, “not living up to [my] potential”, depressed, bored, anxious, lazy, crazy, undisciplined, careless, and/or all of the other unattractive words we have for ourselves.  My swings follow a very predictable pattern: every month, I spend about two weeks headed into, in the midst of, or headed out of an upswing.  This is followed by about two weeks of the same for a downswing.  The two or three days of hypomania are my most productive days: that’s when I get things DONE—housework, appointments, see friends, shop.  I’m moderately productive in the time just before and just after my upswing apex; if I was at my apex all the time, I’d be so freaking rich and powerful!  Alas…I spend most of that time playing “catch up” from my downswings.  During the nadir of my “down” days, I hardly leave my bed.\n\nI wasted years—decades, really—trying to regulate my mood pharmaceutically, which did FAR more harm than good; I wouldn’t recommend it.  Rather, I’ve had much better luck working with my natural temperament instead of trying to change it.  Since I’ve come to understand my mood-cycling, I can (and do) plan accordingly.  Please understand: I fully appreciate that true bipolar disorder is different from cyclothymia, and I’m not trying to belittle the havoc it can cause…I’ve seen it “up close and personal”, and…yikes.\n\nTL;DR: I wonder how many of us with ADHD also struggle with cyclothymia?",

I was prescribed Vyvanse all throughout 2021 after intolerance to Adderall and Focalin. Now I have no idea how I functioned before Vyvanse, and I'm getting so agitated. \n\nI moved in with my dad's sisters in Jordan, told it would be a temporary situation as my mom was kicking me out, and I'm financially reliant on my dad, so he gets to pick my housing situation. My psychiatrist here is vehemently against prescribing stimulants, and even if she wasn't, the only medications available for ADHD are Ritalin and Straterra. Focalin did not help me so I would not respond well to Ritalin, and Straterra didn't help either.\n\nI had a negative reaction to Wellbutrin when I tried it in the past, but am considering trying it again for ADHD until I move back to the US and can take Vyvanse again.\n\nI used to be so much more productive, now I spend all my fucking time in bed on my phone. I can't get 'in the zone' for anything besides roleplaying with my girlfriend, not even writing by myself. I can't even focus for a few minutes on trying to write by myself. And even worse, I can barely focus on drawing if I can will myself to get on my PC or pull out my sketchbook to even try. I've drawn at most a few times a month for almost the past year.\n\nI am going to fucking lose it. I don't know what to do. I don't know, I just want to draw and write again, and not spend my life in my bed.\n\nConvincing my dad to let me move back to the US is futile. He knows I hate it here. He'll tell me when I can, whenever he decides I can.",

        "text": "Hi all. I finally found a psychiatrist in my city that's open to the idea of adult adhd and how to treat it who works with a psychologist who knows how to test properly for it and diagnose.\n\nI want to get a referral from my family doctor to go see him but I am kind of filled with doubt, what if i'm faking it due to all I read and don't actually have adhd? What if the family doctor does not agree to give me the referral? What if being lazy/distracted is just my personality and not an actual disorder and I'm wasting everyone's time?  What if she starts thinking that I'm seeking drugs (only concerta and strattera are available here)?\n\nPS: I've already been unofficialy diagnosed by a psychotherapist 1-2yrs ago through the DMS-5 symptoms list but had to drop him due to financial reasons and didn't want to go further because most psychiatrists here hear the symptoms and their outcome and go directly to antidepressants instead of actually going for adhd meds as adult adhd is quite taboo/unknown here.",

        "text": "I'm 21F and I've been taking antidepressants for 4.5 years. The ones I remember taking are fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, trazodone, mianserin and escitalopram. We were switching frequently because none of them worked and had very adverse side effects. \n\nEscitalopram was the only one that didn't ruin my life and I'm taking 10mg/day currently. It's making me feel alright. No drastic changes but when I take more I experience dangerously elated states when taking more than 15mg.\n\nIt all started because I entered a bad depressive state in 2018. In retrospect I probably needed therapy and support but my doctors went straight to hospitalisation and medical abuse with drugs. They were constantly putting me on adult doses of medications (I was severely underweight) and withdrawing them immediately when I felt worse. They withdrew all of them rather than the antidepressants after I had fainted, kept me there for some more weeks and then sent me home with no improvement.\n\nWe've tried discontinuing escitalopram in Spring of last year because I graduated, moved out and was doing better. I didn't have physical withdrawals so to say but I started having narcolepsy-like sleep attacks (I had EDS most of my life but never in a way where I collapsed) and actual psychotic paranoia even though I have never experienced anything like this in my entire life. I got hospitalised twice in the Summer and put on venlafaxine for months (which ruined my life for that time).\n\nIt turns out that I don't even have a chemical imbalance like they thought. I have ADHD and possibly a sleep disorder and felt sad, frustrated and anxious because it was making my life way too hard. I needed Ritalin all along. Now that I know this I can't stop taking antidepressants because I will probably get an episode again. It used to just be manageable depression and now I'm dependant on pills to not get symptoms which I only get because I take the pills in the first place.\n\nI feel so hopeless and I don't know if I'll ever be able to live my life not being dependent on SSRIs again.",

        "text": "I heard somewhere- 'People who are born into a burning house, think the whole world is on fire'.\n\nI was born into a burning house, but I feel like everyone is wearing fire protective gear but not me. I feel the flames, the same way I feel the print of someone's hand on my arm after they've touched me. Never mind that it's been 20 minutes, or that they didn't apply much pressure- I still feel it.\n\nBut you can't complain about the heat because everyone feels the heat, right? Never mind that you have no protection.\n\nAs life goes on, the flames grow distant. I'm not standing right next to it anymore. So I don't react like I did before. Instead, I watch the flames- it's hauntingly beautiful in the way it is both good and bad for you.\n\nBut everyone's screaming- *'Put out the fire, put out the fire!',* and those that are wearing the gear rush to put it out easily. I don't, cause I'll get burnt- and it's so far away, so I don't have to put it out today. I'll do it tomorrow.\n\nThe people scream, *'Do it today, or everything will get burnt!'*. They scream at you for what it means for your future if those flames rise. They remind you of the past- pointing at the ashes of everything damaged by the flames, that you didn't, wouldn't, *couldn't* put out.\n\nOnly when the flames are right next to you, ready to burn your skin- do you finally put it out. The people scream, *'why didn't you do it earlier?*'. Not knowing that you couldn't- that without gear, you've developed other ways to not feel the heat of the flames, *until it nearly burns you.*\n\nThe flames grow distant again. This time you notice the people- *those same people*\\- running around setting things on fire.\n\nThey set the fire, and scream at you for not putting it out.\n\nYou scream back that they shouldn't have set it on fire in the first place. They look at you in disbelief, ' *I didn't cause the fire, the whole world is on fire'*, they say. They can't seem to notice, that they had put out all the fires already, and the world is on fire now because of all the new fires they created.\n\nBut you can't point this out. That's being naive, irresponsible, and *'you're just too lazy to put out the fire'.*You are never free to relax, and enjoy the peaceful moments where there are no fires- because, *'You always have to be prepared, ready to put out the fire'.*\n\nIs that why I always feel like there is somewhere I have to be, something I have to do but ***I don't know what it is***. Never mind, that I've already done everything I needed too- I still feel like this.\n\nI'm always ready- prepared to put out a fire that hasn't been set yet, or for a war that isn't coming.\n\nBut the thing they failed to tell me, is that being over-prepared means you often look over simple details, you miss big clues- you forget the good things about the flame, because you're only thinking about putting the fire out.\n\nSometimes, being over-prepared means you can't do anything when the time comes, because you're exhausted from preparing for it. Until the flames are right next to your skin- then you remember,*' oh right, I have to put out this fire- NOW!* ***BUT WAIT WHERE IS MY PROTECTION!'.***\n\nThat's how I would describe having ADHD.",

        "text": "Hey! \n\nI’ve been on Ritalin for about 6 months now (40mg + 10 to 20mg extra for when I need it) It works well for certain things, like getting started with stuff and keeping focus. But for some reason I almost feel more disoriented than before, misplace stuff more often, and kind of just care a little less in general. Especially about notifications, messages from people etc. So, I tend to forget them easier. I should also add that I take Sertraline 50mg (SSRI for depression and anxiety) as well, so it could be combination side effects I guess.\n\nI also experience a lot of nervousness as a side effect. I got some beta blockers prescribed and it seems to help a bit, although, I’m not super keen on taking so many different pills, and as a side note I’ve lately had some trouble staying erect, which really sucks for obvious reasons, especially since I’m single and dating.. I suspect this is a side effect as well, or at least in part.\n\nMy doctor told me that it’s probably just because I’m still getting used to them, and also suggested that maybe I should start with 100mg Sertraline. I’m not a doctor, so what do I know, but I feel a little hestitant. He also said that Elvanse is an alternative but was afraid that it wouldn’t be enough for me because it doesn’t have as good effect as Ritalin when it comes to getting started with things.\n\nWhat’s your thoughts and experiences? I have ADHD inattentive type.",

My doctor has given me both in IR and XR forms and pretty much like see which one you prefer. Honestly I’m not sure yet on what works better. The dextroamphetamine I do have Zenzedi for the IR, but it gives me some pretty terrible headaches so have avoided trying the ER version so far. \n\nThe generic Focalin IR one day it will seem decent and then another it’s like it makes my focus even worse. It does seem fairly mild though and so far no headache from it. \n\nIdeally I feel an IR gives more control and I don’t have to worry about it lasting too long. Then I can hit the gym without being too concerned as I know it’s worn off. \n\nSomething I have struggled to get clear info on - Does anyone know if either of these is more vasoconstrictive than the other? Or one type safer overall? My doctor doesn’t seem to have any idea and I’ve read mixed things when trying to research. \n\nI feel the comedown on either is a bit rough as anxiety will be rather high, but that could be normal. I eat healthy and stay plenty hydrated. Also, generally try to only take it every other day so that could be part of my problem too. She said I could take as needed though. \n\nThanks",

However I'm now wondering if the doc insisting I 'had to' go higher than the lowest dosages and to increase my dose every 5-7 days is why I struggled.\n\nWhen I had side effects (nausea, headaches, anxiety, high heart rate) that were strong enough that I couldn't function very well (masking the benefits i got from the lower doses) he would simply stop the meds entirely rather than lowering the dose.\n\nIs it normal to be an adult who only needs low doses? 18mg Concerta, 20mg Esquasym, and 36mg Strattera (non-stim) worked okay for me, any higher and it was awful. I felt like meds were very strong and wore off much quicker than stated, so I wonder if I simply process them much quicker than average. \n\nI tried 30mg Elvanse/Vyvanse (doc said it was the lowest available dose) and it made me so jittery/anxious and gave me panic attacks that I came off it entirely after 5 days.\n\nAnyone experience only needing low doses? or needing to titrate up very slowly (once a month for example)? Hearing others' experiences would be a massive help as I'm considering trying again, but only want to spend the money if there's actually a chance it could work for me next time round.",

        "text": " I wasn't sure where to post this to look for some peoples thoughts, hopefully this is an okay place to do it. I want to note, I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but am not in any danger of hurting myself or something serious. It's not debilitating but the ongoing feel of it is starting to grind me down.\n\n**TLDR:** I moved and between a mix of loneliness, nature of my job, and my  I feel mildly depressed constantly and like I'm just spinning my wheels and doing the bare minimum most days. I've had a healthy balance of in person and online socializing, work, and gym time in the past and I want that back. However, without big solutions like moving, or some kind of miracle solution I don't know what to really do.\n\n**How can I meet people and make friends and maintain a consistent schedule after moving somewhere new?**\n\n**Longer explanation and details:**\n\nI moved back in July for a job after finishing grad school. Overall the job is great (pay is meh but the bennies are great and its very low stress and in my field), but I'm struggling. I'm doing okay at work, but moving after moving to this small town, I feel like I'm just not motivated to do a whole lot of anything beyond the minimum. I'm currently prescribed both an extended release and instant release stimulant med, and have had both increase in dosages since the move. I thought for a while it was my meds not doing what they needed to but I'm realizing now its my environment causing the issues more than anything. \n\nI got really into going to the gym in the last few years and shedding about 100lbs, but after being used to using gyms that had better hours and going either with friends or having friends that were often there at the same time, I've struggled to go regularly at the one in my new town. I can't keep a regular schedule when its entirely dependent on me, and the system that worked for me previously (going with friends, or going really late at night so I have plenty of time to turn off my brain for a few hours) doesn't work here as the gym closes at 8 on weeknights and 3pm on weekends. Closest alternative gyms are about 20 minutes away vs across the street from my apartment. I've maintained my weight and during the field season get some activity in, and kept eating healthy but I've lost a lot of muscle definition.\n\nWork has been a struggle. Not to do what I need to do, but my boss is in a major city an hour away and my daily schedule is entirely self determined for 90% of the time. For some this is amazing but for a person who works best with schedules and deadlines and external pressures (think missing points on assignments in school or a boss being mad for you being late), this setup is really rough on my ADHD. This is doubled with the fact that I have no coworkers out of my office, minus one who is here once a week. The rest of my coworkers are either at HQ or other sites, so I'm alone 90% of the time.\n\nHonestly the biggest issue though is I am lonely. No one ever warned me how hard it is to meet people in your 20's. Double that for moving to a small town that's mostly families and elderly people. I had some sporadic luck in dating throughout my time here, but that's been dry lately. More-so than dating though, is the fact I haven't been able to find a way to make friends here. I have several friend groups who I love but they are spread out and clustered in cities 2-4 hours away, or in other states. This has led to me spending a ludicrous amount of time at my computer playing games with friends and hanging out on Discord. I'm not really an extrovert, but I like hanging out with my friends once or twice a week. I like (and need) my alone time, but outside of Discord, I'm alone 95% of the time. \n\nIt seems as simple as meet people and workout more and set a schedule but for anyone with severe enough ADHD, it's never that simple. I don't necessarily want to change jobs right now but at the same time moving might be the best option if I can't figure something else out.",

I had my doctor transfer the rx there, knowing it could likely be out of stock by the time that was done, but thinking it might be easier to get it there sometime soon.

Then their entire tone changed and she said, \"ok, but we don't have this drug.\" I said, \"so it's not in stock?\" One word response, \"no.\" I asked \"Is it likely to come into stock any time soon?\" One word response \"no.\" But it was aggressive and strange. I waited for some elaboration but it was just silence so I said \"well ok, thank you, bye.\" Idk what I'm supposed to do. They still have it marked as waiting for prior authorization, so even if it does come into stock, it won't be filled. I'm used to my regular pharmacy being more helpful (and nice!) considering I'm not calling out of the blue, a doctor has sent an rx in...
