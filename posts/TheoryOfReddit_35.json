        "text": "I'm sure the tension and conflict between those users that are strong proponents of social justice and those that are strong detractors of it has been discussed here several times, so I don't want to rehash that *too* much (not for my sake so much as for yours, so feel free to touch upon if you'd like).  But I would like to discuss how this ropes in people who feel neither very positively or negatively about the concept- those that look at it as a dim sum cart, with some good dishes and some bad.\n\nAn issue here, as I see it, is that depending on the day and the topic, these now-appellated dim sum customers can be seen be one group as being a member of the dreaded *other*, and thus are thrust into a second type of conflict, very different from the first (pro vs anti) from the dim sum customer's point of view, but identical to it from the perspective of the antagonist's.  To the antagonist, *of course* the person their arguing is a \"SJW/cuck\" or \"brogressive/racist\" or whatever moniker they'd like to use.\n\nWhich gets me closer to the point of my post.  I only recently realized- and this isn't my first reddit account- that /r/me_irl was considered an \"SJW\" subreddit and that was really strange to me.  I didn't understand what the connection was, what the story was; I didn't understand why such a sub needed to have any affiliation with that at all.  Related, but not exactly the same: I read that /r/TumblrinAction was considered by many to be a \"hate sub\".  While I knew that the people very interested in social justice didn't like the sub, I was just as shocked to see it called a \"hate sub\" as I was to hear me_irl was an \"SJW\" sub. \n\nSo I think most Americans know what gerrymandering is.  If you don't, the long story made short is that candidates for the American House of Representatives are voted into their seats by districts within their states.  The number of total representatives is capped at a 435 (the number isn't important), and has been for quite some, even as the population has changed considerably.  So states can and will gain and lose seats as their populations grow and decrease, respectively, and in accordance with the federal census every 10 years, districts need to be redrawn to match population movements.  Now, if only one party were so lucky as it have the newly redrawn district just so happen to be overwhelmingly populated with supporters of their party, while still leaving enough supporters in other districts to be competitive!  What an advantage that would be on the national legislative stage!\n\nThat last part isn't particularly relevant to reddit, but the ramifications of those last few sentences are: as anyone with even a passing knowledge of human behavior could guess, everyone tries to redraw the districts so that they win by a lot in \"theirs\", and they allow the districts they probably have little chance to win fall even more into the opposition party's thrall.  In reality, many, many Congressional districts are heavily Democratic or heavily Republican, and the districts that both parties are actually both competitive in (at least, in any way reflecting national party platforms) is lower than you'd think.  This last line is my point: the most extreme candidates are elected in the districts where one party holds substantial sway.  An echo chamber is produced, and what at first glance appears to be a genuine exchange of conflicting ideas turns out to be, in reality, a conversation between the moderate and extreme of one side of the debate: greatly increasing the chances that the extreme can be embraced.\n\nI suppose reddit has been doing this for years now, but stumbling upon these two subs: one a seemingly normal, apolitical sub being called \"SJW\", and one a much more contentious but hardly evil one called a \"hate sub\", made me think about how reddit continues to gerrymander itself.  More and more, these subreddits- and I doubt I need to mention any more by name- isolate and insulate themselves from each other (which might actually be good, I don't know) but also from the \"silent majority\" of moderates.  The dim sum customers.  And I don't think *that* can at all be good.  \n\nNow of course society has done this for years and will continue to, and the idea of internet contributing to something positive or negative on that front is beyond my scope.  But I don't know if I've ever seen one individual website do it to such an extent, with so many people.  I've seen some shit one Star Wars forums when the prequels were coming out, and I've seen some shit on infowars when conspiracy theorists eat each other.  But I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this level of \"gerrymandering\" on a website as large as this, to this extent, and what they might think it means, and how this might end.",

This effectively silences and lowers the amount of critique power structures expose themselves to. I see it as natural behavior where one wants to protect his/hers property, individual / personal space and position he/she is in.\n\nI raise the question what does 'about/for community' really mean and wouldn't it be more beneficial to go against such layers of abstraction to really feel the pulse of what community may think? In other words communities at start are about allowing people in and as time progresses they become more about keeping unwanted people and their opinions out while trying to maintain what is the idea and direction put in place but less as a form of direct democracy and vote, and more as an idea of those in power.",

Eventually, if I can get enough server power, I'll increase this to the entirety of Reddit historical submissions and comments.  There are two primary API calls.  \n\nTo search comments, use the endpoint: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment\n\nTo search submissions, use the endpoint: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission\n\n**How to search Reddit comments**\n\nLet's pick a topic and some scenarios for our example.  Linode has been experiencing a lot of problems lately.  You are interested in viewing recent comments that mention linode.  I'm going to walk through some API examples on how you could do searches.  Please keep in mind that searches are not case-sensitive.\n\n**View the past 5 comments where someone mentions Linode**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment?q=linode&amp;limit=5\n\n**View the next 5 comments before a specific comment id**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment?q=linode&amp;limit=5&amp;before_id=cyowu24\n\n**View comments older than a day but newer than 2 days ago**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment?q=linode&amp;before=1d&amp;after=2d\n\n**View comments older than 2 hours ago but newer than 8 hours ago only in the subreddit sysadmin**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment?q=linode&amp;before=2h&amp;after=8h&amp;subreddit=sysadmin\n\n**View comments from the author \"automoderator\" mentioning the term \"submissions\"**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment?q=submission&amp;author=automoderator\n\n\n**How to search Reddit submissions**\n\nSearching Reddit submissions is almost exactly like searching Reddit comments.  However, the submission search works a little bit differently than Reddit's.  It doesn't look for the search parameter in the submission title or selftext itself.  Instead, it actually scans every reddit comment, sums up the number of hits by thread and shows the threads mentioning the search term most frequently.  This allows for a more exhaustive search.\n\n**View submissions related to linode over the past 3 days in the subreddit sysadmin**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?q=linode&amp;subreddit=sysadmin&amp;after=3d\n\n**View submissions related to linode in any subreddit over the past week**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?q=linode&amp;after=1w\n\n**View submissions related to germany in the subreddit worldnews**\n\nhttps://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?q=germany&amp;subreddit=worldnews",

        "text": "Two days ago I created [a post in IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3z2pl8/i_am_a_longterm_budget_traveller_who_has_stayed/) that unexpectedly hit the front page with about 4000 upvotes. It was about budget travel and staying in hostels.\n\nWhy do I say \"unexpectedly\"? Well, three reasons...\n\n1. I was just looking for a few questions that I could answer with video responses. (I've noticed a lack of budget travel information on youtube, and I'm trying to solve that with short videos.) So to be clear, I was not looking for a huge post. Just a bit of attention for the content I was making and a few questions to answer. \n\n2. Two days before the AMA, I'd made [a post in /r/backpacking](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/3yrlse/i_couldnt_find_a_good_beginners_guide_to_staying/) with the same intent. The post did quite well for a smaller sub, but in the end only led to 10 or so questions. I could easily take my time answering these, and I picked a couple that I responded to with short videos. This helped set my expectation of what was to come. \n3. I've never considered myself an expert on anything. Despite staying in (~100 hostels), I don't really think I'm an expert at budget travel. When I find other travellers who are planning year-long round the world trips I always want to learn from them, thinking that they are the true experts. So I sort of naively did not expect reddit to treat me as an \"expert\".\n\nWhat this perfect storm of naivety led up to was me getting my ass-kicked early in the AMA. \n\nAs it received 8 quick upvotes I thought, \n\n*That's nice. I'll definitely be getting some content here.*\n\nSo I answered a few questions and (as had been my original plan) I said to a couple of people with good questions that I would be responding later with video responses.\n\nThen more questions came, including one that I had just answered two days prior with a video response. Since I thought that would be a more interesting (and frankly, faster) way of sharing an answer than typing out exactly what I'd said in the video, I shared the video as my answer.\n\nSuddenly the post had 24 upvotes. \n\n*Wow. This could be bigger than I thought.* \n\nRealising I'd been sitting in one spot for far too long that day, I decided to take a short break and go for a walk outside. Very dumb AMA etiquette now that I think of it, but remember, I was still thinking this would get 35 replies or so. \n\nWhen I got back there were almost 100 comments and it was clear there was no stopping this thing. There were also a growing number of comments hating on my answers promising video responses. [One comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3z2pl8/i_am_a_longterm_budget_traveller_who_has_stayed/cyit116) took a particularly rough hit. \n\n*Wait... I'm not trying to avoid the question, I'm just trying to offer  a detailed answer!*\n\nI became distracted trying to address these critiques. I know the hivemind well enough to understand I was only inviting more downvotes, but I wanted to explain myself as best I could.\n\nAt the same time, my inbox was exploding with new questions. Some of which I had answered already, some of which I would like to make video responses to... but there was no time for any of that now, there was only time to respond as quickly as I could to try and stop this ship from sinking! \n\nI threw a link to my youtube account in the AMA to give people a way to find future video responses - and of course, because I wanted some new subscribers. I soon added other social accounts too. \n\nAs soon as it hit front-page my website crashed from traffic and that's another issue I was trying to solve - simultaneously. \n\nIn the end I managed to answer enough to get a lot of positive feedback in my inbox. Though I'm disappointed to say that it's the early haters that are sticking in my mind the most.\n\nTo wrap things up.... \n\nHere are a couple of things I have learned:\n\n* **Redditors don't care so much about quality of information as they do easy access of information.** A single redditor might appreciate the extra effort put into a video response to his/her question, but the hive will hate it for the extra effort needed to watch it. \n\n* **Once an AMA gets big you are seen as an authority whether you want to be or not.** As I said, I don't see myself as an expert traveller full of tips for saving money. I've made horrible budget errors in the past and had to cut trips short because of it. But once I was on the front page, I was getting 100 people asking me to plan out their trips and offer budgeting advice. \n\n* **No matter how much information you give, some people will always hate you for promoting anything at all.**\n\nHere are a couple of questions I am left with:\n\n* What is appropriate etiquette for self-promotion on an AMA?\n\n* Are small-time content creators less permitted to self-promote than celebrities? I don't recall a celebrity ever taking heat for promoting a movie or new projects (so long as he/she made an honest effort to answer questions). \n\n------\n\nI hope what I'm written can prove relevant and useful to think about. \n\nIf anyone is interested in learning more, particularly about my response to the haters, I've created a video answer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxeKJSKx2lk\n\n(As you can tell by my sharing of yet another video response.... I have learned nothing from this experience, haha)",

Well, nowadays she mostly just wants to hustle enough cash to scrape by, but writing is still her big aspiration. She complains about not writing enough, like she should be writing every day—and I remark that she *does* write every day, in the form of kinda long comments on Facebook, sometimes long emails, etc.\n\nAs for me, I write lots of comments on the internet, pretty long and involved ones, and I do have some aspiration to write standalone things and publish them in any other form besides comments—but when I open a text document that's not a comment, I just stall and get all weird and awkward and start going down the research rabbit hole and envisioning some pristine perfect essay that I mostly know is never going to materialize. When I publish something on a blog I usually feel anxious about it and probably delete it a week later.\n\nSo for me it's obvious that commenting on other people's comments or answering questions is a very productive way of writing, even though it isn't what a writer does conventionally. There's something imposing and difficult about writing a standalone \"piece,\" like for Medium.com or a blog or whatever.\n\nRandom questions: Have you noticed this? Does your writerly ambition mostly take the form of internet comments? Have you thought about why and how? Have you thought about ways of channeling the commenting energy into other forms of writing? Do you think reddit is a good place to write, or how could it be better?",

        "text": "Hi TheoryOfReddit,\n\nI study second languages (think linguistics, but a more specialized subfield).  Learning outside of classrooms and using technology are both hot topics in my field, and this fall I took a look at how people use r/Korean to learn the Korean language.  I thought this might be of interest to TheoryOfReddit, though I realize that it might be more of a niche than the typical topic here. I'll provide a summary below. I also presented my [initial findings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/3uychr/ive_been_researching_korean_learning_activity_in/) to the r/Korean community (in somewhat more detail), and it generated some interesting feedback you may want to check out.  \n\n-------------------------------\n**Background**\n\nIn [second language acquisition]() (SLA), great importance is placed on input (e.g., listening and reading), interaction (e.g., conversation), and ouput (e.g., speaking and writing). The internet has sparked a great deal of interest as a way to get lots of second language (L2) input and potentially engage in interaction and output; this is especially attractive for people learning foreign languages where it might be tough to get lots of L2 opportunities in real life. \n\nSome SLA researchers are quite critical of typical classroom language learning, claiming that it is better for learning *about* an L2 (e.g., gaining academic knowledge of grammar rules) than actually *learning* a language (e.g., improving proficiency and being able to *use* the language).  The internet, on the other hand, has the potential for learners to get large amounts of authentic L2 input and interact with native speakers.  Internet spaces like YouTube, games (e.g., Civilization, Lineage), and Facebook have been examined in terms of language learning, but so far no one has ventured to Reddit.\n\n**Research Question**\n\nBasically, I wanted to know how people learn a language - Korean - on Reddit. I chose Korean because I am a learner of the language myself and was familiar with the subreddit.  Korean is also relatively understudied in SLA, and especially in internet-based studies.\n\n**Method and Theoretical Frameworks**\n\nFor this project, I went with [netnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netnography) (basically, ethnography for the web). This involved reading the sub thoroughly for 7 weeks, visiting their frontpage-linked IRC room, and collecting open-ended questionnaire responses from 8 community members. I used Python and PRAW to scrape all topics and comment from the 7 week period to allow for iterative coding.\n\nIn addition to theories of SLA, I also incorporated [Activity Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_theory) and [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)) to frame my interpretations.\n\n**Findings**\n\nMy main findings are themes that emerged from iterative coding of my data:\n\n- Using English to Learn About Korean\n\nWhile learning Korean is definitely the objective of r/Korean activity, members primarily use English along the way. Over the 7 weeks, I scraped 153k English words and 12k Korean words. Out of 298 submissions, only 40 involved language practice (e.g., writing practice, getting links to articles for reading or videos for watching). 152 involved language knowledge (e.g., asking what a word means, seeking explanations of grammar rules), and the rest were translation requests (typically drop-ins) or meta-learning discussion. The heavy emphasis on language knowledge is actually in line with language classrooms based on rote learning.\n\nThe IRC room saw a bit more Korean used- about 19%, as opposed to 7% on the subreddit. The Korean used in the chatroom was also quite communicative- people chatted about the weather, made some jokes, talked about daily life, etc. Sub users also noted this difference, and some pointed out that the IRC room was really valuable for getting better at the language.\n\n- Participatory Interactions\n\nThis finding is probably a bit bland for TheoryOfReddit, but discourse is very participatory on r/Korean, with no central authority responsible for content or knowledge. Multiple users provide complementary answers to questions, and users probe deeper and expand on OPs. This is quite different from a language textbook or classroom, which relies on some authority to guide learning. As you might expect, this allowed users to explore language not common in classrooms, such as slang or gaming vocabulary.\n\n- Rules to Promote Useful Content\n\nr/Korean has a pretty short set of official rules. However, voting patterns and comments revealed some unwritten rules which all had the intent of supporting content useful to learning Korean.  I described 3 rules:\n\n1. **Be Accurate**: if you are answering a question, you should provide accurate information. This gets upvoted and thanked. If not, you get downvotes and corrections (some kind, some unkind).\n\n2. **Use Hangeul** (Korean script): Romanization should be avoided at all costs. Users believe it hinders learning (I tend to agree) and would rather see Korean written in Korean on the sub.\n\n3. **Give Sufficient Effort**: Another one that won't be a surprise to TheoryOfReddit, but low effort posts are not rewarded. Overly simple questions (e.g., something that could be answered by a dictionary search) or lacking answers (e.g., a single word translation with no context) are frowned on; thoughtful questions and highly detailed (and *exemplified*) answers are desired.\n\n- Labor Divided between Expert Users and Learners\n\nOn r/Korean, expert users are Native Speakers and Advanced Learners (advanced: can communicate easily in Korean; has studied the language extensively).  These users are looked to, virtually as equals, when questions need answering. The Advanced Learners are often just as or more able to explain grammar rules, as they learned these explicitly themselves (native speakers of any language can struggle with this! Try to explain how to use \"a\" and \"the\" to an ESL speaker...). Natives specialize in cultural knowledge, idioms, and slang- the kind of stuff you need extensive exposure to the language and culture to know.\n\nLearners (beginners mostly) are responsible for asking lots of questions and keeping the sub active. These questions are useful not only to the OP, but also to many other learners, including lurkers (I was able to connect with a couple of lurkers for the questionnaire). \n\nIntermediate learners sort of straddle both roles- they have considerable study experience so they know many rules and vocabulary, but lack the level of expertise that advanced learners and native speakers possess, and often have their own questions to ask.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn short, r/Korean does not exemplify the sort of authentic L2  input and interaction that SLA researchers believe best support language learning. However, it is a well-structured and supportive community, and the activity there probably does help the acquisition of Korean in some way. There is some contention in the field on this point, but I believe that academic (explicit) knowledge of a language can lead to real ability in communication.  The catch is, though, that you need more than academic knowledge- it can't replace input and interaction entirely. Most sub users are not exclusively learning on r/Korean; many of them visit IRC, chat with each other on smartphone apps, and also engage in meatspace language practice (tutors, language exchanges, classes). Still, I think my findings are a caution against overly-optimistic views on the internet for language learning- the L2 input and interaction is not a guarantee, even in internet spaces devoted to learning the langauge.\n\nThe sub had a generally interested and positive reaction to my findings, and I saw some efforts to make changes or try some new (and old) things. For example, weekly writing practice topics have been revived.\n\nI think I would find major differences looking at learners of other languages on Reddit. For example, Europeans who get high-quality English education in public school can use Reddit to get loads of English input and interaction (even though they might also spend a bit of time on r/suomi for some native-language discussion). There are also a few highly-active Spanish-medium subreddits that could be utilized by learners of the language. Japanese might be like Korean... r/LearnJapanese appears to operate somewhat similarly, however r/newsokur (all in Japanese) is much more active than r/hanguk (a Korean-medium sub).  \n\nAnyway, hope TheoryOfReddit found this interesting. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. ",

Far from being \"servants of the masses\", Michels argues this \"leadership class\" will inevitably grow to dominate the organization's power structures rather than its membership. **By controlling who has access to information, those in power can centralize their power successfully, often with little accountability, due to the apathy, indifference and non-participation most rank-and-file members have in relation to their organization's decision-making processes.**\n\nRead through this post about how reddit was destroyed and notice the similarities.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30[2]",

        "text": "There is much complaint around here about reposts, and IMO comment threads expire far too quickly. Because comment threads are so short lived, the discussions on reddit are either a small number of well thought out replies (on the best subreddits), or an explosion of annoyingly shallow replies on the popular ones.\n\nThis could be solved by making reposts a revision of the original thread. The revision could include an entirely new title text but with all the previous title texts expandable, and the comment thread could simply continue to be expanded and voted on. I really think this needs to happen for less repetition and more in depth dialog. Because I have very little faith in reddit.com actually pursuing this direction, I want to talk about starting an open source project that accomplishes this.\n\nAlso I'd love to hear other well thought out proposals for improving Reddit's mode of communication, or even open ended but structured online forums in general. I think several less extensive changes but still very helpful could be adapted from StackExchange, such as moving posts to more appropriate subreddits, collaborative editing, and more sophisticated karma, and karma threshold rules.",

        "text": "Downvoting is a source of anger for many people. If you look at \"lurkers, why don't you post?\" askreddit threads, they usually say it's because of a fear of downvoting. For the mentally unstable people of Reddit, of which Reddit has a high proportion cause, you know, internet and young people, then downvoting can cause unecessary grief and pain for **well-intentioned** posts. \n\nNow, the fear is that bullshit will surface, but I don't understand. As long as you upvote good posts, then the inane bullshit will remain at the bottom. Consider this example for three posts:\n\n&gt; (200 upvotes) Best Post\n\n&gt; (100 upvotes) ok post\n\n&gt; (-100 upvotes) bad post\n\nThen in a system without downvotes, we would have:\n\n&gt; (200 upvotes) Best post\n\n&gt; (100 upvotes) ok post\n\n&gt; (0 upvotes) bad post\n\nAs we can see, the order is maintained. However, we gain the benefits of (1) the bad poster isn't hurt **in case he was well-intentioned** (2) we eliminate the biases of downvoting, where people downvote for the wrong reason e.g. simply disagreeing with the opinion or other miscommunication problems.

        "text": "[This thread in particular spawned this thought.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ynmf6/which_statement_although_100_true_still_causes/)\n\n(edit: it appears the post has been removed - even more questions now but I'll remain brief)\n\n16.8k comments and counting.\n\nI want to preface by saying that I have no significant sociological/psychological background and that I raise this question mostly to get fleshed out responses on why Askreddit culture revisits this question so many times in so many ways. As well, I realize points I may bring up below have been discussed at length before in various ways but I would like to center this thread on the above post in particular.\n\nI feel as if the many iterations of this thread are, at face value, a typically ugly side of Reddit but for some reason this thread pulled me in a little bit more just because of how vitriolic the users are acting towards each other. I figure it is spawned by the \"100% true\" portion of the question which I'm sure can rustle many jimmies. At the same time this thread, to me, reveals a lot more about the way Reddit's commenting structure devolves at scale.\n\nMy first observation is the subject of *controversy*. As users we actually have the option to sort by controversial. From my own user perspective (i.e little to no knowledge on the working algorithms/mechanisms that filter controversial), this option reveals a lot of the comments that may have been hidden due to massive disagreement or something more sinister in Reddits userbase. But when this thread continues to pop up, is it because its in a default (therefore gets visibility) that we get this type of question? Is it actually meant to garner any sort of discussion (as per Askreddit rules)? Or is this type of \"controversy\" entertainment?\n\nGoing through the thread you see all the \"jerks\" Reddit is known for. Without going through them, there is a significant amount voices from both directions for most of these statements where the nature of the question, and the many ways it has been asked, appear to bring up the same old topics which are, at the core, difficult to discuss and conclude to any significant point. I bring up something I read often that these users are not speaking *with* each other, they are speaking *at* each other. The vote becomes a weapon that aids or dismisses opinions you may be for or against. This type of thread, to me, is symbolic of the inefficiencies of voted content - something may appear more or less \"true\" by how many votes it receives. \n\nThe fact that there are also nearly 17k comments, and counting, says to me that people may not even be responding in the sense of a typical discussion involving two or more parties speaking to each other. Users are adding comments to a thread of many other comments - speaking to no one in particular but still divulging their \"100% true\" statements into the ether, maybe hoping they strike a chord with someone that may (or may not) agree with them. Does this action, of speaking anonymously to no one in particular, have any sort of positive outcome in an environment like Reddit? (I realize now this question relates to many other websites with anonymous commenting - and may bleed into outside the internet i.e. whistleblowing) What positives arrive from a thread like above? \n\nI figure there are many more questions I want to ask but the more I go on the more I begin to answer my own questions about Reddit culture (versus other websites). Specifically, if the symptom of this type of Askreddit thread is rampant hatred for one another, what is the cure so to speak? For myself, I always thought of threads like this as something like a zit or pimple, where zits/pimples themselves are not the problem - it is why those zits occur that is representative of a much larger problem in the body/system as a whole. \n\nWhat is Askreddits controversial opinions thread and is it something Reddit should be proud of hosting?",

Ideally, the network would also be expanded to determine the degree to which other accounts reciprocate communication or post in similar subreddits.\n\nWhile this would otherwise be a grandiose exercise in Reddit navel gazing, I'm wondering if there might be useful research applications here. For example, examining broad social network dynamics and activity among mental health support groups: \n\n* To what extent are new users brought into the community fold?\n* What are the characteristics of *facilitators* who respond to many new users?\n\nThere are myriad ways to approach this type of analysis.

        "text": "I think everyone here knows that many redditors display significant racism.  If we look at threads concerning non-western incidents, they are usually filled with racially antagonistic, generalizing comments, several of them upvoted in the thousands.  Threads about American and western incidents contain no such comments, and view any problems as indicative of only a minority subset of the population.  \n\nWhat I believe is that redditors (and probably Americans in general) have a propensity to discount any logical argument, as long as it mentions racism or eurocentrism in any form.  I'm going to focus on a very narrow case here, which I've been vocal about:  the definition of the continents.  \n\nA while back, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3fy8xy/cmv_the_recognition_of_europe_as_a_separate/) in /r/changemyview.  It concerned the unwarranted classification of Europe as a separate continent, and the idea that white supremacy (the exceptional position of western europe for the last few centuries) was the main reason that this was so.  \n\nLogically, the arguments I stated were sound, and any unbiased geography buff would agree with me.  There is nothing that geographically separates Europe from Asia, which does not also separate several other regions of the world.  For example, the Ural mountains are much, much smaller than the mountains that cordon off India from Eurasia.\n\nThe thread itself was net upvoted, but the responses to the thread were extremely antagonistic.  Most of my comments were downvoted en masse.  \n\nI have also mentioned this point in passing on other threads where it was relevant, and universally gotten downvoted multiple times.  At first I thought this was due to people perceiving what I was saying as false information (Europe is taught to be a separate continent after all).  However, even when I succinctly provided the evidence behind my position, I was still downvoted en masse.  \n\nBoth of these incidents suggest to me that any sort of language which can be remotely perceived as an affront to white people cannot be used when arguing a point.  Using the phrase \"white supremacy\" in the CMV thread sparked an emotional reaction where most posters/voters took offense to my post, and proceeded to disregard its substance.  Saying that \"Europe isn't *really* a continent\" can be seen as an attack on Europe, the west, and by extension, white people, causing many white redditors who read such a statement to instinctively downvote it, regardless of any factually correct evidence that follows it.  \n\nAs an aside, I think this meshes well with the fact that [half of white Americans](http://publicreligion.org/2014/10/graphic-of-the-week-americans-racial-disconnect-on-fairness-and-discrimination/#.VfrfwildVW3) perceive anti-white racism to be just as prevalent as discrimination against other races.  I believe this is indicative of racism as a \"zero sum game\", where equality feels like oppression if \"privilegedness\" was the prior norm.  \n\n[Evidence](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/13/white-definitions-merit-and-admissions-change-when-they-think-about-asian-americans) that people are very attentive to cues of \"racial threat\" inherent in factual information.  The study states that white participants tended to disfavor a purely meritocratic admissions process when made aware that Asian Americans score higher on such criteria.  If people are so attentive to such miniscule cues of \"racial threat\", it makes sense that those differences would be magnified when language like \"white supremacy\" is used, even if it isn't done in an accusatory fashion.

Do we even need it to work as designed? Off topic posts can get deleted by mods or ignored, why is there any need to downvote them in the first place?\n\nGiving people a downvote option is like walking into a classroom full of kids and giving them each a soft ball to throw at kids who they think aren't taking learning seriously. Guess what happens. Now put that in a online environment with no consequences.\n\nPosts that i have seen get mass downvoted :\n\n* Requesting people to stay on topic\n* Requesting people to be polite and refrain from personal attacks\n* Asking people whether they have evidence to backup their argument\n* Telling someone that you disagree with their argument, and then explaining politely why. This is also very likely to result in a \"Stop arguing!\" post that gets mass upvoted.\n* Expressing an opinion that is not popular with the majority of a subreddit, but which is still relevant to the subreddit/topic\n* Requesting that people explain why they disagree with an opinion\n* Posting evidence (such as links to news articles) that contradict an opinion/argument that is popular on a subreddit, or suggesting alternative explanations for a situation. Also very likely to prompt a rude \"You don't know what you are talking about\" response that gets mass upvoted.\n* Asking a question that veterans of the subreddit think that all users should know\n\nAnd basically everything under \"I don't like you/your post\". Want to see this in action? Find some random gaming related subreddit and express an unpopular opinion there, such as \"I think that [unpopular weapon] is actually pretty good and this is why...\". Cue mass downvoting, personal attacks and sarcastic remarks that you have no idea what you are talking about and must be drunk/high/an escaped mental asylum patient/a troll/etc. And then people will just downvote every post you make after that because \"it's that [insert derogatory term here]\".\n\nYou also see this very often in AMA threads. Someone posts a \"tough\" question for the OP (E.G. value for money question for a retailer)? It gets massively downvoted by all of his fans. Post a generic \"I love you and the stuff you do! Keep it up!\" one liner? Massive upvotes.\n\nSome sub reddits have gone so far as to remove the downvote option entirely and it seems to work much better. Someone doesn't like a post? They are forced to be mature adults and walk away instead of reaching for the downvote button. The most common thing i hear about why people don't take reddit seriously is the downvote button and the horrible misuse of it.",

I don't think there are any on reddit around this time. Around the days of Thanksgiving, my submission was never approved. There were almost no posts on the subreddit.\n\nAnd I don't really care if they are or not. They shouldn't be able to block all posts from being submitted. Only special subreddits like /r/mpapproval are ok. Which is a subreddit that the mods of /r/montageparodies use.\n\nThere's often large gaps of time between new posts on/r/askscience because no one approves the posts. I remember there used to be a bunch of submisssions in /new/ that people were able to respond to. And I'm going to just say it. I don't appreciate the censorship. The last time /r/askscience brought in Monsanto to shill whatever crappy answers they upbotted and selectively answered, I lost a lot of confidence in the moderator team.\n\nModerators need to stop being so obsessed with reddit and let reddit admins figure out how they can fix their broken website. I know /r/askscience mods prefer open visibility of what they are doing. They have all the flaired users set as moderators, and I think they have some other thing set up.\n\nEDIT: Blocking news posts from showing also probably messes up the /new/ and /hot/ queue. Reddit is not made to function like this. Early votes count a lot more for how important a post is.\n\nEDIT2: Are people seriously ok with this? Have you even tried looking at /r/askscience right now? There's like almost no new posts on the subreddit.\n\nEDIT3: 2 hours in, I've reminded myself that I had previously thought of a subreddit for a different type of content.

        "text": "I guess the most recent examples I can think of are /r/me_irl and /r/blackpeopletwitter being mentioned in popular /r/askreddit threads, or on /r/bestof, or when it a submssion from the subreddit hits /r/all; however, there is a percieved notion that this happens on a smaller scale when a subreddit shows up on /r/trendingsubreddits.\n\nWhat I've noticed over the past few years is that users on Reddit have become more protective of small subreddits. Here's an example. When there is an /r/askreddit thread about under-the-radar or small subreddits that need more love, there will inevitably be responses along the lines of \"I'm not giving up my secrets and have Reddit ruin the subreddits through Eternal September\".\n\nBut this phenomenon has a history all its own, stretching back to about 2012. In those days, it was alleged /r/subredditoftheday triggered an influx of new users into featured subreddits, ruining that subreddit. The most prolific incidents I can think of are [when /r/wheredidthesodago](http://np.reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago/comments/14z916/congratulations_rwheredidthesodago_you_are_the/) [and /r/fullmoviesonyoutube](http://np.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/14xlp0/december_16_2012_rfullmoviesonyoutube_thats_right/) were featured. In addition, polandball bans anyone who mentions their subreddit in another subreddit, to avoid an Eternal September influx. \n\nTo meet the self-text rules in the wiki submission guide: In my opinion, those people who frequent /r/subredditoftheday, /r/tinysubredditoftheday, and so on are the people who are actively searching for new, interesting subreddits, and are more likely to understand how each subreddit works before contributing. It's also a relatively small subreddit compared to the big dogs like /r/askreddit and /r/bestof. I don't know. It seems like a scapegoat.\n\nSo, there are a lot of forces at work. Do you think the surrounding criticism is justified, or unnecessary? That is, do these forces deserve blame for \"ruining\" smaller subreddits?",

I'll point out a few I'm seeing:\n\n- Since March 2015, both /r/announcements and /r/blog are in a constant relative decline that doesn't look organic, but is probably based on the fact that [the two aren't defaults anymore in a couple of European countries](https://www.reddit.com/r/defaults/comments/3hu24f/list_of_default_subreddits_20150821_multiple/)\n- Since Mid 2013 text-based subreddits in general seem to gain popularity compared to image-based catch-all subreddits like /r/pics, /r/funny or /r/aww. This coincides with and might be related to the additional 25 default subs announced in May 2014, but could also have other reasons.\n- Some subreddits grow very smoothly like /r/todayilearned while others experience hiccups like /r/funny, /r/gaming or /r/Music\n- For /r/worldnews one can see a spike of subscriptions during major world events like Euromaidan in March 2014, the Gaza War in July 2014 and the Paris terror attacks in November 2015\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone, this write up is going to be a response to the basic question, **\"How can you best structure a moderating team to maintain maximum trust between moderators, other moderators, and the community they moderate?\"**  \n\nWhy the focus on trust?  Simple: trust is fundamental to every relationship between an authority and the community that authority seeks to manage.  Without trust, the authority struggles to function and the community protests against the authority.  Of course in a moderating context, there will always be some people who break rules and just want to see the world burn.  But in the main, most people who participate in a community just want to keep on keeping on.  So long as they trust the authority to do the authority's job, there is relatively little friction between the authority and the community they manage.\n\nThis post will be separated into three different sections. (1) A background about who I am, where I come from, and what experiences I am drawing on. (2) The various incentives and drawbacks at my disposal to improve trust between moderators, other moderators, and their communities.  And (3) a rough and incomplete guide to how to figure out when you are striking a healthy balance.\n\n###Background\n\nSo some background. I am a moderator for /r/leagueoflegends, a subreddit that sees one of the highest amount of traffic in reddit. In part as a response to growing distance between the community and the moderating team, we created and then left a subreddit for talking about subreddit issues (/r/leagueofmeta).  In /r/leagueofmeta, we explore many issues that run similar to the topics that this subreddit explores, just applied to /r/leagueoflegends as opposed to reddit.\n\nOver the course of the nearly three years I have been a moderator for /r/leagueoflegends, I have seen the community grow from a mid-sized subreddit to one of the largest there is. On this point, let me just share all of the stats I have been able to get my hands on sequentially: \n\n* [This is every month's pageview total since  January, 2012](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TI5LQtGuTG1-k8KTkPrCnqzJxG76_we0DwJKnFZv4ns/pubchart?oid=1859579476&amp;amp;format=interactive)\n* [This is every month's uniques total, as measured by Reddit, also since January, 2012](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TI5LQtGuTG1-k8KTkPrCnqzJxG76_we0DwJKnFZv4ns/pubchart?oid=2060036390&amp;amp;format=interactive)\n\nDuring this time we have the team's relationship with the community go from horrid (with no trust afforded anyone on every side of the equation), to great (with probably too much trust being given to moderators), to neglected (with almost no moderator interaction with the community for a period of 5 months), to firestorm (with primarily one or two actors with large audiences coalescing already existing malcontent), to relatively recovered trust. I have seen both ends of the spectrum of trust several times (additionally because I was a mod briefly of /r/gifs and of /r/politics, which each contributed to each end of the spectrum respectively).\n\nSo right out the gate I think I need to say **there is no perfect solution that gets every actor to trust one another**.  These relationships are all fluid and works in progress. Trust can be gained and lost, and lost trust is much harder to rebuild.\n\n###Incentives for Trust Building (and their Discontents)\n\nFortunately, there are several ways to build trust within your moderating team and between your team and the community. Some ways work better than others depending on the specific needs and makeup of your team and community, the way your team and community typically do business, and the normal stressors that your subreddit sees. Basically, context matters.  The following is not a complete list of incentives, but they are some of the more important things that my team has done to build trust.\n\n* **Give moderators the autonomy to make decisions about the rules they enforce**\n\nThis step is crucial for the /r/leagueoflegends' moderating culture. Every mod is an equal voice and vote in policy discussions. This structure exists in part to encourage moderators to feel a sense of stewardship over the community that they might lack if they were only there to enforce a predetermined set of rules they had no power to alter. Additionally, the more people able to look over a set of rules critically with similar purposes in mind, the better a fit the result should be with the community (a similar mentality exists in coding cultures).\n\nThe drawback here though is that you can get into situations where there are too many cooks in the kitchen.  Emotions can get high when people are passionate about doing what is best for the community. Something has to exist to keep these emotions from boiling out of control and unchecked. And so, I exist. As top moderator, one of the main functions of my role is to manage conflicts. But I do not work alone. Several members of the team are trained in resolving conflicts amicably and two others of the team (facilitators) have the official power to help me officially resolve conflicts if they reach a point where official action is needed.\n\n* **Allow moderators to make real-time decisions with limited live input from others.**\n\nOne of the core problems a large team faces is **acting quickly.** Larger teams face added pressure to react to reports and content quickly and accurately. Larger teams also risk becoming less intimate and seeing higher turnover rates than smaller, more close-knit teams (of course, larger teams can also absorb more inactive or nearly inactive members).\n\nNot everybody who says a bad word needs to be banned. Some are literally just quoting the word.  Different contexts, while having similar facts, might have very different degrees of abuse. We have a tiered punishment system that allows moderators some guidance to choose which action is the most appropriate to take against a given abuse. What's more, the structure's default is to provide users with several steps of feedback to either question the accuracy of the action or to learn from their mistake to not repeat the disruptive behavior.\n\nThe solution to the problem of needing to act quickly is **training moderators how to think** about problems that need solutions, and letting them do that thinking without close top-down supervision.  So long as moderators are thinking critically about the situations they encounter, about what the goals of the policies they are enforcing are, and whatnot, trust can be maintained even in a distributed model of leadership (a distributed model which, as covered above, helps keep moderators engaged in their communities).\n\nThe drawbacks here are pretty simple: people mess up. People make mistakes and unless you are communicating constantly (+stress and time), then those mistakes are easily interpreted as malicious behavior.  Some members of a community will be inherently more likely to distrust authority (this is reddit), and some members of a community will be opportunists looking to latch on to drama to watch the world burn (\"trolls\").  To mitigate these drawbacks, this approach increases the need for transparency while also increasing the stress and responsibility that each moderator takes up (as a trade off for their more autonomous ability to act).\n\n* **Post moderator actions publicly (transparency).**\n\nSo if moderators are making real-time decisions mostly on their own, and if the community is engaged and wants to know what is happening, a reasonable response to this dynamic is to create a space to tell members of the community what is happening. This means everyone's favorite word: transparency!\n\nTransparency brings a number of benefits. Moderators, in the act of being transparent, communicate their expectations to the community, some of whom help enforce those expectations through reports.  Community members, knowing moderator expectations, are better able to see when those expectations are not being met, are better able to see when something strange happens, and therefore are more accurate at calling out strange behavior either from moderators or from other members of the community. It all sounds great news for everyone right?\n\nDespite its clear benefits, transparency does bring drawbacks. Accurate and meaningful communication between moderators and communities takes skill and patience, which are not always attributes that every volunteer comes with equal amounts of. Poorly communicated actions (or short-tempered), even if well thought out, will galvanize communities and risks deepening any existing fissures between moderators and their community. Knowing the risks of a poorly communicated action, this risk often adds stress for the moderators who are expected to communicate more. A normal person's reaction to stress is to avoid it, leading to less moderating activity on the actions that the community is more interested in seeing explained.\n\nEvery bit of transparency adds stress. The more stressed people are, the less they are inclined to moderate.  People stop being as active as you need them to be. This creates higher turnover as you have to look for and train new moderators to handle the deficit in actions.  New mods are not as experienced or familiar with their subreddits, so moderators bump shoulders with each other and the community more often (due to inexperience), and the very history of the subreddit gets lost.\n\nIn effect, too much transparency can destroy a moderating team's ability to effectively moderate if left unaddressed.\n\n* **Create an environment where it is acceptable to make mistakes**\n\nThis is a little easier than it sounds.  If moderators do not trust that other moderators have their backs, they will not be willing to stick their necks out publicly to give communities the transparency that the community desires. To that extent, teams need to be able to work together on evaluating the most controversial actions to determine what the best course of action is while being reasonably respectful to the fact that someone genuinely thought their action was justified.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to be wrong. Everyone gets that. But if someone is wrong, then there is no sense in protecting the wrong individual's decision against the community, especially if the community is correct.  It is better to admit the mistake and try the best you can to remedy it.  You are not throwing an individual under the bus by calling an action a mistake (unless you loudly proclaim, \"Hey look everybody, /u/BuckeyeSundae made a mistake. What a terrible moderator. Get him guys!\").\n\nWhat's more, the benefit of this approach increases over time. The more often a moderating team addresses feedback reasonably and reverses a decision, the more regulars in that community will recognize that the moderating team is trying to listen to good arguments. That creates a space in which you can make mistakes and the first reaction of your regulars will be \"Um, was this intentional\" rather than \"YOU ARE THE WORST CANCER I HATE YOU.\"\n\nProviding some protective buffer that allows moderators to be wrong creates more trust from moderators to the community (and other moderators) and willingness to make mistakes (so long as they are genuine mistakes). \n\nThe drawback here is more subtle. There will be occasions where a team agrees as a whole that a course of action was correct that still ends up being controversial. In these situations, a review of the policy might be in order, but you still might end up deciding that the end result was still the correct one. This drawback is basically a conflict of expectations. The community is not always right (and as I have written in /r/leagueofmeta, [the community is not a coherent entity that you can treat as a democracy](https://redd.it/388g6n)). What should matter more (IMO) is the strength of the arguments being made, not how many people are making them. Try to be open to the idea of change, but be careful and critical about what the implications of those changes could potentially be.\n\n###Striking the Right Balance\n\nThese structural incentives for trust building each come with serious drawbacks that need to be carefully considered and addressed. The \"perfect\" solution is damn near impossible to find and know that you have found it. But there are some guides to be able to tell whether you are close enough for the moment.\n\n* **Figure out what broad-strokes feedback your team is receiving** \n\nAre people generally trying to help your team? Are they generally trying to help improve the subreddit?  Are they sharing ideas for how the team could better do the work that they do?  Providing reposts? These are all signs of a healthy interaction between community members, even if some of those members might disagree with some actions you choose to take. But you cannot know what your relationship with your community is if you are not paying attention to it.\n\n* **Watch how moderators are interacting with each other and members of the community**  \n\nWith each other, signs of stress normally show up in how regularly people passionately fight about the correct path of action for improving the subreddit (and just how passionate it gets). With members of the community, watch out for short, snide interactions with normal community members who are acting normally. These are some signs of a stressed moderating team with an unhealthy relationship with their community. Turnover in high-stress teams is likely to be significantly higher than low-stress teams which is hella bad for a myriad of reasons. What's more, because many members of the team are stressed, the likelihood of them being able to calmly listen to one another to find solutions that work for as many people as possible is reduced.\n\n* **Examine the team's general burden sharing**\n\nA healthy team will be sharing the burden of the human actions that moderating requires.  What percentages are right for your team depend on how active your subreddit and moderating team is.  In /r/leagueoflegends (which has normally been in the mid to low 20s in size), my ideal has been to get to the point that no moderator has greater than 20% of the human actions taken in any month.  We do not have a quota system in any way, but we do ask that each full time moderator spends at least 5 hours a week (which ends up getting loosely enforced due to the somewhat opaque nature of what 5 hours ends up looking like).\n\nYour measure might be different, but that 20% mark has been a great indicator of health for /r/leagueoflegends. The time I mentioned earlier about our neglect of the community? One moderator was pulling 40-50% of the human actions in those months, making it impossible to sustain the view that we were interacting with the community in a regular, meaningful way.\n\nWith some sloppy, back-of-the-envelope mathing (the scientific term), I decided to try to standardize what my goal with /r/leagueoflegends is. Probably a mistake, but here we go.\n\n    (100 / &lt;team size&gt;) * 5\n\nThis equation must assume that your team can adequately handle the moderating load that your community sees. Assuming that, then so long as your team is larger than 5, a reasonable threshold should be where no one active moderator passes that percentage threshold.\n\n* While we're on metrics, **track how often moderators are distinguishing comments**  \n\nThis is an imperfect measure because some subreddits have meta communities. In other subreddits, moderators make a habit of interacting informally with users. Still, the distinguished comments measure can serve as a useful shorthand in a pinch to establish a baseline of where your team is at now and how it might be able to improve. \n\n/r/toolbox provides the ability to give template responses for removals. They are not the most effective means of communicating with community members (that would be personal messages), but they are better than nothing. So in general, I prioritize interactions with the community as follows:\n\nNothing &lt; Templates &lt; Personalized messages. \n\nPeople like interacting with people, not machines. Templates increase distance between you and your community, though they do also communicate expectations. Still, distinguished comments can help show you how often your team engages your subreddit.  (If you want another look into this point, see the third point in [this thread](https://redd.it/22v7gy) titled \"Moderators represent.\")\n\n* **Try to get a read for how open to other views members of your team usually are** \n\nDo they interact with feedback in good faith, or do they quickly dismiss feedback and move on with their normal moderating duties? Maybe something in between? Try to think of the experience from the perspective of a community member. Would a community member find the interaction to be meaningful? Sometimes a moderator is going to end up repeating themselves to ten or several dozen people when it comes to a common talking point, but so long as they are reacting to what is actually being said, this can still be okay. Repetition is not necessarily the sign of being closed to feedback, but it often can serve as a defense against considering changes.\n\n---\n\nThere are tons of other things you can do to build trust, and tons of other ways to try to gauge whether the balance you are striking is ideal for your community.  Offer some in the comments below. I love thinking about other ways to build trust beyond what I have already tried, and I adore even more thinking of other ways to measure its success.",

However it's something that is much less frequently talked about nowadays. It seems to me that right now, if you had to generalize reddit as a site made up of \"dog people\" or \"cat people\", I would have to say the voting majority seems to be very pro-dog. \n\nJust doing a quick (quite unscientific) analysis of the current front page of /r/aww (sorted by hot), I counted that:\n\n- 21 out of 25 posts featured dogs and/or cats. \n- 13 featured only dogs\n- 5 featured only cats\n- 3 featured both.\n\nThis supported my perception of reddit today, but determining how much basis in reality the old \"reddit loves cats\" meme had is a bit more difficult. [I tried plugging the terms \"cats\" and \"dogs\" into fivethirtyeight's \"how the internet \\(reddit\\) talks\" graphing system.\n](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=cats.dogs&amp;start=20071015&amp;end=20150831&amp;smoothing=24)\n\nIt seems to me that while dogs have actually had an edge in terms of popularity for most of reddit's history, things became a lot more clear-cut around 2013. \n\nI'm not sure what to make of this. While the difference doesn't seem to be as striking to me as I had personally suspected, it still supports my perception of a shift. \n\nSo what does it mean? Are the types of people who are more likely to be early adopters of a site like reddit also more likely to prefer cats to dogs? Is the less tech-savvy general population who have filtered in since reddit hit the mainstream more likely to prefer dogs? Is there another explanation I haven't considered? Or have you not noticed this shift at all, and are not sure what I'm going on about?",
