I was supposed to have my proposal approved almost a year ago, but have not made much progress since then. I used to be super passionate about the project I was working on, but a combination of a unresponsive supervisor, personal health issues, and life in general have seen my interest in completing the degree dwindle. Occasionally, I make progress but when I reach out to my supervisor it takes weeks to even have my emails acknowledged. \n\nAt this point, it just feels like leaving at the end of the semester is inevitable, but this also feels like a pretty cheap and easy way out, which I will probably regret. \n\nAnyone else ever experience this? How did you handle it?",

Faculty wouldn’t respond to emails and were never at their offices so it took me 2 months to find a date for the oral exam that worked for my committee.

However on the day of my oral exam one of the committee members did not show up (apparently they forgot they had an undergrad class to teach at that time). My committee chair would not let me proceed with my presentation/oral exam unless all members were present and now I have to re-schedule the oral exam. The same scheduling issues are happening again where some faculty are not responding to emails.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has had this experience. After all the work to wrangle faculty and schedule my exams this just feels like a huge letdown.",

        "text": "I am a 23 y/o young professional working as a research chemist. I am entering a PhD program in material sciences and engineering come Fall 2023. I am currently involved in a no-strings-attached serial flirtation with a multitude of professors at my future institution. I will be fully funded, so I am looking for research groups that will challenge me and place me in a good position for post-PhD job searching. I want to make sure that I receive mentorship during paper writing and don't have a professor who operates on a policy of salutary neglect towards their students. \n\nSomehow news of my PhD acceptances has leaked to my company's President. He let me know of a faculty with whom the company has an STTR contract in place. It just so happens that my research interests greatly align with those of this professor (biomaterials). The prez even offered to give me a formal introduction to this PI; I told him that I will do my research (read some of this dude's papers) and let him know. I was also told that if I do research in this group, I could sort of continue working for the company (another source of income as a starving PhD candidate - yass queen!!)\n\nI read the PI's work, got genuinely fascinated by him, and set up a zoom call with him by myself. It seems like we are a good match.. However, I am weary of the following:\n\n1. I would be his fifth grad student\n2. His sources of funding right now are primarily NSF, NIH, and the contract he has with my company. Isn't this juvenile? Shouldn't I be looking for a more mature researcher with a gamut of funding sources (DoD, private sector, etc)?\n3. His publications are not very high impact factor. I think he has one angewandte chemie. \n\nYesterday, my company's President flew back in to work and stopped me again to have this conversation. I let him know that I zoom called this PI and got to know him. I explained my aforementioned qualms. He let me know that the company gifts him 500k per the STTR and that it is all DoD sourced. He looked at me and says \"you should go work for him, he's a rising star.\" I awkwardly replied that I am still considering all my options and am awaiting my visitation weekend. \n\nI know that the decision is ultimately my own. Yet, I find myself perplexed. I assume this is what political machines in academia are like; someone knows someone who recruits someone else. This is normal and not immediately a bad thing. However, I ponder where this political machine will spit me out. Wouldn't it return me exactly back to the company where I currently work? That's not appealing; I want to grow past my current company. \n\nI appreciate numerous aspects about this PI. He is deeply interested in working with industry, ran a successful startup to purchase, has years of experience with IP and science biz. He is a hard worker. I am also *slightly* enticed by the idea of staying in my company's network; I can return as an intern whenever, could get an extra check for working on projects (still need to verify if this is true lol), etc.\n\nIf I join his lab, I feel like I am satiating the egotism of my company's president. Of course he would like members of his company joining this professor's lab; this is how he can cement his ROI on the STTR?? I don't really like the idea of saying \"yes dad\" to my company. \n\nAnyone ever been in this situation?",

It seems like a lot of national labs are in remote places where not driving is prohibitive, and only a handful are near enough urban areas to be accessible to public transit.

The lab I work in doesn't have any strict hours, and half the people don't even show up on the weekend (and those that do, don't do it every single weekend). Having seen the labs at my undergrad (and the 70+ hrs/week students put in there), I know this idea of a *genuine* work life balance is often times thought of as a myth, however, now that I've been exposed to how wonderful things *could* be, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that most labs in most schools simply don't operate that way.\n\nI want to get my PhD in organic, and currently I have an offer from a good school that I'm considering (Boston College), however, it seems that most labs/PIs there (and elsewhere) are fairly strict about the minimum 6 days a week BS, and some even enforce minimum hours/day. \n\nI personally think that if you're good about time management and planning things out then coming in on the weekend should be more of a rarity, but most profs don't feel that way.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been able to achieve a genuine/healthy work life balance doing their PhD in chemistry, and if so, how did you approach this with your advisor? Were they aware that you weren't in 24/7? Did you say something to them to establish this boundary? I'm not sure what I should be looking for/if it's a possibility that I could find something similar to the lab I'm currently at.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot stay in this lab/school, so I have to consider other options.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But after joining the university due to a stupid regulation change I can no longer get a degree in mathematics and will have to only study computer science. (Don't ask me to explain the whole system just trust me on this). I've been very passionate about mathematics for a long time so I've always wanted to have a degree in math (from like 8th grade I've been studying extra mathematics on the side, and being involved with all the math clubs) . I also know and enjoy programing but math is my true passion so I thought this was the perfect arrangement. Complete this double degree, them move onto studying mathematics as a masters and live my happily ever after. Now I've found out the university has swindled me out of my mathematics degree. I've sent out my applications for transfers in many universities but since I got the news too late I missed a deadline for many of them. So even if I want to transfer I'll have to send my applications next year and transfer on my third and final year which sounds dumb. So what would you do in my shoes? Can I still continue my masters in mathematics if I just study CS. I don't want to spend 3 years without studying mathematics even though I really enjoy CS. And even though the CS course is decently focused on mathematics (its around 30-40% math) I still want more. (Also I am in Europe)\n\nP.S - I've already finished the first semester, the double degree (so mathematics) was supposed to come in from the second semester.",

        "text": "TL;DR What are considered achievements besides capstones, publications, awards...etc.\n\nI just graduated this fall and one of my recommenders asked me to draft a letter of recommendation for myself and then send it to him so he can add, edit..etc. \n\nI am having a hard time writing a letter of rec. I read that I am supposed to talk about my achievements, but I cannot think of anything that I have achieved in undergrad. I got a mediocre GPA: 3.1, basically did data entry as my time as a research assistant, and got an internship in an unrelated field to what I am applying to. I did not do any extracurriculars, a capstone/thesis, or win any awards or scholarships. The achievements I have made are more internal than external.\n\nIf it matters, this is for a post-bacc research program, to gain experience and get exposed to the field's research. I intend to pursue grad school after.\n\nSo, what are considered achievements? What if you don't have any external achievements?",

        "text": "Hi all! This is my last semester in the Ph.D. program, which has been a long and exhausting experience for me, and I can't wait to graduate. Writing my proposal was a lot of work for me. It took so long to go through all the revisions and corrections from my advisor and committee, but I finally proposed it last semester. Yay!!\n\nMy advisor emailed me earlier asking me if it is okay with me that he shares my proposal with his other advisee. If it were any other student in the department, I wouldn't have a problem with it, but this person and I have some history that makes me not wanna have anything to do with her. Long story short, in the past, I've shared research ideas with her which she later used to her advantage in the classroom, in our lab, and while having conversations with our advisor or other professors. I learned from those experiences and although I keep a cordial relationship with her, I no longer share anything with her and I feel very protective of my unpublished work.\n\nI don't want to talk to my advisor or anyone in our department about this. But I absolutely don't want my work in her hands until it is published. Could you tell me what would you do? Like, how can I say no in a brief and concise way without having to give an uncomfortable explanation? I don't want anyone to think there is any kind of \"drama\" in our lab, especially when it is between two female students in a predominantly male department.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "tl;dr - I cannot get a response from the person 'overseeing' my internship, which is required for graduation, and I'm freaking out a bit. Looking for advice.\n\nHey you lovely people, looking for a bit of advice. I'm in (what should be) my fifth and final semester of an MPH - epidemiology program. As part of our program, we are required to have an internship and create two 'deliverables' for the organization, using our newly honed public health skills. The university will post opportunities from different organizations, but actually applying for and getting the internship is 100% our responsibility (no issue there, we're all adults). So back in November, I reached out to someone who posted an opportunity with our university. She emailed back the following Monday, stating that she received all my information and was excited to work together, and she would reach out by the end of the week to get everything started. (I was thrilled, excited, and happy to have a plan.) However, the end of the week came and went. I figured I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, she was probably busy, things come up, etc. no big deal. When I didn't hear anything by the end of the following week, I reached out. She emailed back the beginning of the next week, that she wanted to schedule a meeting for December 21, which was a few weeks away, but I was like 'great, just let me know when, and I'll take my break then,' as I was / am working full-time. \n\nMeeting happens and includes her, her supervisor (I think), two other students, and me. We all express that we have to do this in order to graduate and have a plan in place by January 4 for the 'deliverables' that we are providing. She's all positive that everything will be fine, no worries, so excited, etc. Then, as we are signing off, she states that she's going on vacation until January 3, and she's leaving the office about 2 hours after our meeting, but she'll be available by email. I email her with a plan/thoughts/etc. a couple days later, and hear nothing. Touch base again on the afternoon of January 3, to see if I can get a finalized plan in place. Finally hear from her on the morning of the 4th. Submit all the required documents to my school and think it will be smooth sailing. \n\nI email her the following Monday, letting her know that everything was submitted and approved through the university, and while this is supposed to be a remote internship, their office is close enough (\\~1 hour away) that I can go there later in the week to meet in person, or we can set up a Teams meeting, or phone conversation to get started. She emails on Tuesday, saying she wants set up a meeting on Friday (doesn't confirm modality) and she'll be in touch the next day. I hear nothing, so I email Wednesday afternoon. Still nothing. I email Thursday evening and Friday morning, trying to set up a time to meet so I can get started. She emails on Monday afternoon, that she is headed to the port and will not have email access for a week while she is on vacation, but hopefully I can start doing some research and come up with a plan for deliverables under in initiative that is not even mentioned on their website, and we'll 'hit the ground running on Monday.' She should have been back in the office this past Monday, and I've emailed her twice (once last week Monday and got an 'out of office' response, and once yesterday) and am yet to hear anything from her. \n\nI thought I had this all squared away in November. Now, if I don't complete 90 hours of work and 2 projects, I'll have to postpone graduation and likely have to pay additional tuition. How do I express to this person that she is getting free labor, but it requires her to put in 5 minutes of work? Has anyone had any similar experiences? What did you do?",

The most important factor to me is a job I can do remotely and where I don’t work in a group (mostly individual or client work). \n\nThe issues: \nThese programs require 3.0+\nThese program often want research experience \nNone want GRE\nI’ll need to apply in the fall for these programs and my time is very limited (I don’t want to take more than one gap year)\n\nGood news: \nMy new nannying job is only three days a week (11 hour days). So I was planning to do volunteer work the other days. Now i’m seeing I should get a more lab oriented job, although i’m not sure that’s possible. \n\nQuestions: \nAre there any volunteer positions that could help me get into these more research orientated grad schools? \n\nI’m assuming I should take more classes to boost my gpa?",

        "text": "So I wanted to get some advice on how to navigate this situation, and what would be the best approach.\n\nFor reference, I’m a senior graduating in the spring. I’ve applied to PhD programs in Statistics, and plan to head to a program in the fall. I have a rough idea of what my research interests are.\n\nIn one of my classes this semester, there is a post doc teaching the class. He’s done a PhD in a related field (applied math), but he’s done his dissertation on the *exact* and I mean *exact* type of research I’d want to do. I think meeting with him before I graduate just to pick his brain, and ask some questions regarding his research area could be of huge benefit to me. \n\nI want to make sure this meeting is as productive as possible. So I thought of a few ways to approach him regarding the meeting. I wanted to get your advice on what seems best. \n\n1) do some pre reading on his work, and then approach him with questions and my interests. I saw his 65 page dissertation on his personal website. My plan was to try and skim through his dissertation, or generally read through parts of it to get a general overview, come up with some questions about that area itself, what I’d like to research in it, and get some idea of possible resources to tackle. \n\n2) do no pre reading, and treat it as a casual conversation where I ask him questions about my interests and about his work. Mainly get some questions answered and resources about how to go about learning the area.\n\n\nNote, that some of you may think 2) seems a bit bad and 1) is an obvious choice. However, I do want to emphasize that this professor of the class (post doc currently) is not someone who I plan on working with in the future. He’s merely a person I’m going to for questions on how to proceed in my learning of that subject. Hence it’s more casual and no pre reading.\n\n\nWould appreciate thoughts you may have.",

I graduate with my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling this May. It’s a great, CACREP certified program. This will allow me to get my LPC and be a counselor, which was my original goal, and still my plan. \n\nNow, some of my cohort are choosing to go into Clinical Psychology Doctoral programs of all different types. \n\nOne of my closer friends has chosen to go to an online program that would only take less than 3 years to get a PsyD (at Walden). I would love to join her and get my doctorate in such a short time! However, it is not an APA accredited program, and is not intended for psychology licensure. \n\nThe benefit of having this degree would mostly be in name of having completed a PsyD, and not having to slow my LPC progress down to be in school. I would be able to work full time while attending. \n\nThe problem with this program is that I wouldn’t gain any additional psychology licensure from it, meaning I would spend +-3 years on this program when I could hypothetically be in a full scale APA PsyD program of 5 years. \n\nThere’s also an additional degree I’m also considering at my in-person alma mater. It’s a psychometry specialist degree, but is not a PhD. The problem there is I’m unsure what additional diagnostic tools and rights I would get from that program. \nI almost considered trying to enroll for both (the online PsyD and the specialist). \n\nSo this is my many details. If I left anything out please ask, I’m in desperate need of advice!!",

        "text": "Hi so i’m a masters student and I smoke daily, always one bowl every night. I dont feel the need to smoke more than this and i’ve been doing this for about 2.5 years.\n\nI always imagined that I would just stop smoking one day after it stopped being fun, but that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nHowever, I am concerned about my level of motivation to complete work. I’ve noticed as i’ve entered grad school it is really difficult to get myself to get work done. I push it off, I avoid thinking about it, it’s a bit daunting. Regardless, I got a 4.0 last semester so classes are fine. I’ve developed a thesis project too and am working on sending it to the IRB. But I just feel like I have no motivation to do any work on this project- especially the really annoying nitty gritty stuff. (Data collection I have no issue with). I decided to look up some research on cannabis and motivation and there is partial support for the idea that cannabis consumption decreases motivation. \n\nI eventually want to do a PhD and i’m worried that my habits will get in the way of my goals so what i’m wondering is has anybody else dealt with this? Did someone ever stop smoking and see their motivation get better? I’m not looking for advice I just want to hear some personal testimony on the subject because i’m interested to see how people have worked this out. \n\nTLDR; what are your experiences with using cannabis during graduate school? Were you able to stay motivated?",

(Stipend rates haven't been posted yet, and if I TA/RA, which is TBD, then the university would withhold for me).\n\nAlso, should I add the insurance premium reimbursement to my estimated income???\n\nThis is so confusing and way stressed about this..plus im also trying to figure out my 2022 taxes..",

        "text": "Good morning, all. I am currently midway through my MBA program at my chosen university, working full-time and taking all courses online. This semester, I have a professor teaching advanced business statistics who has a very thick accent, which can make his lecture videos very difficult to understand, especially when looking at the transcript (he uses Microsoft Streams). I say this not to insult the man as he appears quite knowledgeable, but that I can tell it will require some extra concentration. \n\nAfter going through the videos and taking my notes, I went to bed. Woke up about an hour before starting to write this post due to some weird dreams, which presented themselves as other courses I was taking and needed to pay attention to, and as such, were quite taxing.\n\nOne was in a large room, with some sort of massive fluid dynamics experiment going on. There were people there who I presumed were other students and the professor. I suppose this was my first true experience with lucid dreaming, as after I felt stuck there for some time, I realized that I wasn't taking any course like this and left.\n\nI was (as dreams go) immediately sat in more of a traditional classroom setting, for another class I knew I wasn't taking, and I felt compelled to pay attention and absorb the material presented. I can't remember what the subject was, but before I could have the same realization as last time, I woke up and started recording what I could remember.\n\nI woke up exhausted, but I also couldn't get back to sleep, and it's nearly time for me to get up for the day. Has this happened to anyone else?",

Am I giving too much importance to the university I get my degree from or is it not that much of a difference?\nMy main idea is to do the MFE at oxford and then go to do an MBA in the USA.\n\nAs for me, I think I am capable of getting more than satisfactory grades in the universities I attend. \nThe last year of high school was the only one I really studied and my gpa was 9.51/10.\n\nMy feelings are that I feel that my life is going away and I have not done anything yet and I see that people are advancing or almost about to graduate and I have not started .\n\nAny advice would be welcome",
