If so, what do y’all do instead (if not nothing)? \n\nI’m asking bc our school only has 3 P/F practicals a semester, but they’re INCREDIBLY stressful, inconvenient, AND inconsistent (ie some graders are SOOO easy and some are so hard for NO reason). Also, having practicals doesn’t make sense now that Level 2 PE is gone so what’s the point? I also read the COCA standards and there are no explicit minimum hours for OPP practicals (or OPP in the curriculum in general). \n\nAll of this is to say, would it be worth it to convince our school to just get rid of practicals? We can still have labs to learn techniques but we don’t need additional unnecessary stress…",

        "text": "Hello - MS1 here. I know I'm a baby, and don't truly understand anything, but in general, I just wanted to share some of the doubts I have regarding myself pursuing medicine. Reasons:\n\n\\-Throughout undergrad, and through the first semester and a half of medical school (as well as my gap years, where I worked research), I don't think I ever felt excited, inspired, or internally motivated to more fully understand any of the work I was doing. That isn't to say that I loathed every second I spent studying/working, but it's all been done for the end goal of improving my resume --&gt; getting a better and more prestigious medical school / residency / fellowship / job --&gt; making more money, and enjoying more prestige.\n\n\\-I think the above text was reflected in my 'why medicine' statement for AMCAS; it was extremely weak and cookie cutter - mainly because I didn't have a solid answer to the question. \n\n\\-Aside from my academic disinterest, I'm not interested in helping people (at least from a medical perspective). \n\n\\-Sometimes, when i've given thought to this entire matter, I land on \"oh, I'm just doing medicine for the money. If its a job I can barely tolerate, and still make a large amount of money in, I'll be fine.\" This kind of makes me seem like an asshole, but its not entirely true. While I do want large amounts of money, I don't want to spend my life slaving away in a job I hate.\n\nOverall, I think I went into this field to satisfy my own insecurities and pursue a discipline that promises a large amount of financial and societal prestige. I only chose medicine because it was the easiest pathway to these two things (my parents are doctors) - if they were bankers, or lawyers, I'd probably be a banker or in law school right now. What do you guys think about this? Should I just grit my teeth and continue? Take some time off? Is it common to feel this way (when I share these thoughts with my classmates, they seem to feel quite differently from me). Thanks, if you've read all this.",

Honestly, I wish I had this when I was a students it would have saved me so much time and stress from trying to learn by myself. \n\nI want to provide this for free because I need feedback everyone on how to make better videos.

Now I’m on Anesthesia and I’m finding myself enjoying hands on skills and getting better at them than I had previously expected. Some of the residents are really pushing me toward anesthesia and make really convincing arguments: autonomy over patient management, being able to essentially keep a patient alive independently in an emergency setting, good quality of life. I’m enjoying the rotation. Today I was asked if I really LOVE it, if I eat sleep and breathe anesthesia, etc. My question: do you really need to LOVE a specialty to choose it? If you don’t eat sleep and breathe it, is it not the right choice? Would love to hear some personal anecdotes and thoughts from others. Was it love at first sight with your chosen specialty, or did you make a practical decision? How did it work out? Thanks!!",

Yet I'm still sometimes insecure about my pre-med course and school of origin. And I know it shouldn't matter anymore because heck I already finished med school.\n\nI think it's different in the US, but where I'm from, many people took health professions for their pre-med courses like nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, medical laboratory science, etc. I took biology and while I will always love biology and appreciate it, I can't help but feel left behind as compared to graduates of health courses who already know how to interact with patients and do skills like IV insertion and stuff (nursing), know a lot about drugs (pharmacy), know how to interpret labs (medical laboratory science), and so on.   \n\n\nI felt a bit insecure when I heard a classmate who's a  nursing graduate say that while she encountered a lot of new stuff in med school, she was already familiar with a lot of it from nursing school. And a pharmacy graduate classmate once said that med school covers a lot of material, but it isn't far off from how much material they had to cover in pharmacy school. And here I am thinking with my biology degree, everything is new and the material is several degrees of magnitude more than what I ever covered in pre-med.\n\nI also came from a small and relatively unknown university, but managed to secure a spot in one of the top med schools. It came as a culture shock that virtually everyone in the room came from a top university and graduated with honors.   \n\n\nI sometimes kick myself in the shins thinking \"If only I'd gone to a more renowned university\", \"If only I'd taken nursing or pharmacy before med school...\", and so and so on. But at the end of the day, I know it doesn't matter anymore because I'm freakin 'done with med school.",
