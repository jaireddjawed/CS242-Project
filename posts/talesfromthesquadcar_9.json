        "text": "So you know when you're still a child even the smallest things can leave a big impression? Well heres two stories that left me with a very positive impression towards the police.\n\nPrelude: My mother is Russian and although she moved to the west after the fall of the Soviet Union her parents still live near Moscow and of course they wanted to see their grandchild as often as possible. So every two years my family would go visit them. \n\nThis first story happened in 2000. My sister had just been born so my dad stayed at home with her and his sick mother, while my Mom and I flew to Moscow for a few weeks. While there we visited many friends including Ivan, the police captain that I've written about in [Running in Circles](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2dorty/friendrunning_in_circles/). We all decided to go to the *Flame of the Unknown Soldier* park beside the Kremlin to eat ice-cream and walk around. Back then you could still park super close to the red square so that's what we did. A few hours later we come back to the car and Ivan realizes he forgot to turn off the lights. Shit, battery is obviously dead. He looks around and spots two Traffic Officers, so he goes over and identifies himself as a fellow Traffic Officer and asks them if they could give us a push so that he could roll-start his Lada. No problem! So we all got in, Ivan's son and I sitting in the back looking out of the rear window at the two young Officers pushing the car. We started cheering them on as we started rolling and when the engine started up we clapped and they smiled and waved. \n\nAs a 5 year old kid that was a super cool adventure of course but looking back on it that was also one of my first interactions with the Police and it left a big impression on me. A good impression, and that's pretty important when people are young, early impressions form attitudes later in life.\n\n\n\nAnyway on to the second story. This was about two years later. My sister was old enough to travel now and my Dad's mother had died so we went and visited Russian again, and again we visited Ivan. Ivan had been promoted to Sgt. since the last time we were there so he had better hours now and a nicer patrol car.\n\nWe had stayed overnight at Ivan's apartment with his family, and he had gotten up early to go to work. However around 1pm he had a lunch break and decided to come home. So he came through the door in full [Uniform](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2737/4273673815_6c58371d93_m.jpg) and then showed me all of his stuff. I got to hold his unloaded gun (might have been a CZ 75, not 100% sure though), and wear his hat. Got locked in his cuffs and he showed us how to properly use the black and white signal stick while directing traffic. It involves a lot of twirling and is basically an extension of your arm. It also doubles as a baton. After eating together he begins to get ready to go back to work and offers to give us a lift to the subway station. OH BOY I GET TO RIDE IN A POLICE CAR! \n\nWe all go downstairs and pile into his brand new patrol car. As a Sgt. he gets an American made Ford [Crown Victoria](http://diecastpolicecar.poliskarr.org/gallery/74_03_09_08_1_22_13.jpg), which at the time was better than anything domestically built. It had leather seats and no divider since prisoners were still transported in the Ladas. Anyway he stops at the subway station, we get out and in that moment some dipshit runs the red light we were stopped beside. So obviously the lights come on, the siren starts wailing and that big American engines roars as Ivan stomps the accelerator. We watched him race after the guy and then went down to the subway.\n\nThat's all folks! I'm pretty certain that my appreciation for what Police Officers do comes from my friendly encounters with them when I was young. I'm certain other people had bad encounters as children and now view cops in a very negative light. \n\n\nPS: Just remembered a little bonus. Ivan told us how he was using his traffic stick to direct traffic one time and while he was twirling it the strap broke and it went flying. He just kept directing with his hands since he couldn't leave his post but afterwards he couldn't find it again.",

        "text": "“So, does it qualify?” \n \nI let the question hang a second in the air as I digested the scenario the detective on the other side of the phone had just spelled out for me: A jealous ex was stalking his girlfriend, tormenting her at home, her work place, and out in public. The victim had reason to believe he had broken into her house as well, but hadn’t been able to substantiate the claim with hard evidence. Oh, and there was also the texting of threats and the accompanying pictures of loaded weapons – that was some nice icing on the criminal cake.\n \n“Yeah, I’m sure it does. If you could just forward me the warrant numbers for the stalking and threat charges I’ll get right to work on tracking the guy down.”\n \n“Great! I really appreciate it. I didn’t know what you guys did exactly but I’m glad you can help out on this. I can see it going bad quick so the sooner this guy’s off the street the better.”\n \nI hung up and awaited the email with the information I needed to start tracking down my new target. It was the biggest case I had adopted in my new role as fugitive investigator in the newly formed Warrant and Apprehension Team and I was rearing to dive into researching the target. While I was waiting, I pulled up several websites that would aid in the investigation; from basic search engines and social media sites to police specific databases that aggregated more sensitive data from government channels. The sound of the email arriving in my in-box was like a starter’s pistol and I began getting to know my quarry with eager determination. I loved my job.\n \nAn hour later and little to show for my hard work, I decided I needed to re-group and reassess my tactics. The bad guy didn’t have any presence on the usual social media networks, moved every month or so according to police records, and had no utilities or property in his name. Even his cell phones were of the “burner” variety; cheap and bought weekly at the local convenience store along with his packs of “Black and Milds.” I was getting nowhere fast.\n\nI called back the detective who had referred the case to me. She was assigned to the Domestic Violence unit and I knew she had her hands full with incoming cases as well. When she answered, I began describing my problems with generating even a starting point with her wanted person. \n \n“Well, call my victim up. She’ll be happy to help, I’m sure.” I was a bit apprehensive to bring a victim into the fold as I knew full and well cases of domestic violence and stalking were touchy subjects for people. I realized, however, that it may be my best option in finding the target so I went ahead and made the call.\n \nWendy was more than willing to help. In fact, she seemed to relish the idea of playing detective in her own case. “Jonny’s a douchebag and I know he’ll slip up soon. When he does, I’ll call you and you can grab his dumbass and rough him up!”\n \n“Well, I’d be happy to lock him up, but I don’t know about the ‘roughing up’ bit. If he fights, we may got down that path but most of these guys go wussy once the cops roll up on them.” \n \n“Oh, he’ll fight. Or run. He’s afraid of jail. That’s the only reason I called, really. If he wasn’t doing all these threats and stuff, I’d be chasing him down for child support anyway.” Wendy seemed less worried about the danger in the case than I had imagined.\n \n“Well, if you could forward me any texts or voicemails he leaves you, I’d be thankful. Maybe he’ll put something in there I can use to figure out where he’s staying.” Wendy agreed and also gave me a list of Jonny’s friends in the area so I could start doing the creepy “sit-outside-your-house-and-look-through-your-windows” thing that so frequently aided in locating fugitives.\n \nLater that evening my phone became possessed. The incessant buzzing from the incoming forwarded texts got so bad I had to bury the device under some laundry so as not to wake my wife. Jonny had gone on a drunken bender and provided a trail of disturbing texts chronicling his voyage. He vacillated between professing his love and regret for leaving Wendy to pictures of knives stabbing dolls with the caption “Wish you were her.” The last picture provided the most insight into the case, although it was also the most unfortunate one to grace my department-issued cell phone that evening: Jonny sent a full-nude selfy, his miniscule manhood on proud display alongside many empty bottles of malt liquor reflected in the hotel mirror. The conveniently forgotten water glasses with the Days Inn logo etched into them did not go overlooked. \n \nThe next day I traveled to the only Days Inn within “striking distance” of Wendy’s home. The clerk immediately recognized Jonny from his mug shot I showed her but informed me he had checked out about an hour before I had arrived. The room had already been cleaned, so there was nothing to be gleaned from inspecting its left-behind contents but my other request came up with better results. The clerk happily provided the tag number of the vehicle Jonny had registered to his room during his stay.\n \nI researched the car when I returned to my cruiser, finding it was registered to a female who lived nearby. On a whim I went to speak to her, presuming she didn’t know who had her car and that maybe I’d be able to tag on a grand larceny charge to Jonny’s growing case. \n \nJonny’s ride wasn’t at the house but another, registered to the same girl, was. She promptly answered when I knocked and seemed surprised a cop would be knocking. \n \n“Do you know this guy?” I asked, holding up Jonny’s mug shot for her inspection. \n \n“Yeah, that’s Jim.” \n \n“And, does Jim have your car?” I didn’t want to tip my hand just yet.\n \n“Yeah. He’s taken it to go visit his grandma. Why? Is he ok?” The woman suddenly began to look concerned. “He’s a great guy, a little down on his luck because of his back-stabbing baby mama, but really nice. Is he ok?” The urgency and concern grew on her face so I assured her he was fine but asked more about how the two met.\n \nShe went on to explain how “Jim” had met her at a homeless shelter she had volunteered for. His sob-story played all the right keys on her ready-to-fix-it organ and she happily loaned him her spare vehicle on the promise he would give her love to his ailing grandmother. Good people can be so naïve sometimes. It’s a sad fact.\n\n“Jim may not be everything he claims to be but I really need to talk to him. It would be better if he didn’t know I was looking for him but could you call me if he shows up?” She reluctantly agreed, although I knew her bleeding heart would probably spring some new holes for Jonny when he visited again. I took her information and made my way back to my office to dig some more. I knew I was getting closer but the lack of actionable data was frustrating.\n\nThat evening my phone had another work out. Wendy texted just as my family finished dinner and my annoyance quickly turned to fear when I read its contents:\n\n“Jonny was here. He killed my fish.”\n\nI called her and got the whole story. As Wendy arrived home from picking up her kid from daycare, she heard the rear basement door to her home slam. She panicked and fled to her neighbor’s home where she called 911. Responding officers were still checking the area while she was speaking to me on the phone. I hurried to her home as well and spoke to the supervisor in charge, giving a brief background on the case in a manner I knew would ensure patrol would make an extra effort to find Jonny that night. I then went in with the crime scene tech to assess the damage to the home. \n\nWendy had entered the house with the first cops to arrive and pointed me in the direction of the basement play-room – the area that sustained the bulk of Jonny’s frustration fueled burglary. Sure enough, a shattered fish tank was still leaking water in a steady trickle, its former occupant, a six inch Oscar, lay wide eyed and motionless on the rug below. \n\nI went back to Wendy and just as I was about to inquire if she had another place to stay, her phone buzzed with an incoming text. She surveyed it a moment, then contorted her face in fear and sadness as she turned the screen for me to see. \n\nThe text read, “You’ll be floppin’ like this tomorrow” and was accompanied by a picture of the out-of-water victim of Jonny’s latest outburst. \n\nWendy had found her tipping point. I arranged for a taxi to take her to her parent’s home and while we waited had her busy herself with an inventory of the rest of the home to see if anything else was missing. As she exited her bedroom, I could read on her face something else had been tampered with.\n\n“He… he stole my… toys.” She said, her head hung and bashful.\n\n“Toys? Like, action figures?” \n\n“No. As in, like, bedroom toys.” Her face reddened as I realized what she meant. \n\n“Weird.” I contemplated a moment before realizing Wendy was staring at me with a questioning gaze. “Oh, no, not weird for you. Weird he would steal your… toys.” Wendy looked relieved but no less embarrassed and made her way out to the awaiting taxi.\n\n“I’ll talk to you tomorrow afternoon unless something else happens, ok?” Wendy nodded her head and ushered her kid into the car. She looked exhausted and battered, the gravity of the situation weighing on her finally. \n\nThe next morning I received a forwarded text from Wendy as I made my way to my desk.\n\nIt read, “Why you late for work today?” and was again accompanied by a picture, this time the front of the door to the realtor’s office she worked for. It was the break I had been waiting for.\n\nI gathered up the guys in the office and gave a quick breakdown of the case up to that point. The kicker was the last bit – the realtor’s office was only a few blocks away from us and tucked back in an industrial area that had only two exits. If Jonny was still waiting at the office, he’d be easy to grab. We broke into two teams and quickly drove to the area. \n\nWhile on the way I received another forwarded text from Wendy. “I got a present from your nightstand I think you parents would enjoy.” I didn’t take me as long to figure out what he was alluding to as it had the night before.\n\nI was making the turn onto the street and saw a familiar face driving a car with a familiar tag: Jonny in his borrowed bleeding-heart-mobile. He didn’t pay attention to my unmarked SUV and I was able to do a quick turn around and position myself behind him at the light. I also called all my buddies over to my location to assist in the traffic stop. \n\nNow, police use a special technique on serious cases like this. Jonny was known to be violent, had access to guns and knives, had a history of running and fighting the police, and could possibly pose a real and immediate threat to the community if not taken into custody in the most expeditious manner possible. We called the maneuver a “tag” and it involves making contact with his vehicle from the front (reversing into his car) and then again from the rear, pinning the car and throwing them off balance thanks to the surprise element. I was able to get in front of Jonny and at the next traffic light, with no other citizen’s vehicles nearby to be put in a dangerous situation, decided to attempt the technique. Unfortunately, my partner who had the rear position decided he needed to throw on his lights and siren while still a dozen feet behind Jonny and before I had started to reverse my car. \n\nJonny’s reaction was immediate: he zipped to my left, taking part of my taillight with him as I was reversing in his direction. I slammed my car into drive and fell in behind him. \n\nA turn or two later and we were back into the urban traffic we had so fortunately avoided in the area we started the take down. I knew the danger level was just turned up to eleven and realized I needed to end the pursuit as soon as possible. Jonny slammed on his brakes to avoid being boxed in by a stopped car attempting to merge into a busy roadway. I followed him up and through a median as he made his way into the street, traffic coming to a halt in the intersection thanks to the sudden appearance of several unmarked police cars with flashing lights and sirens. \n\nThe way ahead was clear and I made my move – tapping his rear driver’s side quarter panel and pushing through to the right. The PIT maneuver spun him into a 180 degree turn and forced his car over a raised curb dividing the East and West bound lanes and blowing out his passenger side tires. He gunned his car while I traveled further up and made a turn to follow, my team cutting him off while his useless rims spun and threw sparks. He rammed one of the cruisers’ rear end when a box-in was tried, and veered around and into open roadway. His car was less enthusiastic about his escape attempt, however, and seemed to be shedding parts every few feet. I caught up quickly and three more SUV’s, reds and blues strobing and sirens blaring, pulled in front of him. He slowed to a stop and frantically tried the door handle. He stopped cold and threw his hands in the air when confronted when the business end of an AR15 was pointed in his direction. \n\nJonny was totally compliant after he figured out how to open the door. As if reading off a script I had memorized years before, he repeatedly questioned “What did I do?” and “Why am I under arrest?” while I searched him after cuffing him. \n\n“Whose car is this?” I asked him, ignoring his obviously-answered questioned. \n\n“My friend. She knows I got it. I was heading to my grandma’s house. She’s got cancer real bad.” Jonny was sweating profusely and darting his eyes anywhere other than to meet my gaze. \n\n“Your mom’s mom? Who died when you were seven? Or your dad’s mom, who lives on the other side of the country in a nursing home?” I wanted to show him I knew what was going down and my question went ignored.\n\n“That backpack in the trunk is mine, and I don’t give you consent to search it!” \n\n“Consent’s kind of out the window when you get arrested and I have to inventory your wrecked car.” I slammed the cruiser door and walked up to my crew. “I’m going to call the owner, see if she wants to come pick this up or have it towed.” They laughed in reply, inspecting the shredded tires and hanging bumper. \n\nA moment later I had the car owner on the line. “Jonny’s done with your car.”\n\n“Who?” \n\n“Oh, I mean ‘Jim’, I guess. He’s done with it. There’s a problem though – it’s sitting in the middle of Elm Street with only two tires and a busted bumper.” Shocked stutters occupied the other line for a moment and I noticed my team began going through the car’s contents. “Hey!” I yelled over to them. “”He said his dildos are in the trunk!”\n\nThe stuttering intensified.\n",

        "text": "Ok, so back in 2008 I was working with a company whose veteran employees loved Friday Night Karaoke.  I resisted going to these events for a while, but one week my wife was out of town and I was up for some comraderie.\n\nSpending a couple hours after work at a Japanese restaurant and finally getting up the courage to sing \"Love Shack\" with a female co-worker, I decide to pay my bill and drive home.  (No, I had not been drinking, so relax, coppers!)\n  \nAnyway, as I'm driving thru slow moving traffic up Kingsway, my ipod shuffles to Queen's \"We Will Rock You\".  At a red light, the guitar solo kicks in and I just OWNED that mother with my trusty Gibson Atmospheric Air Guitar.  Grimacing musically, getting my shoulders into it, throwing up the horns, the whole nine yards.\n\nAnd then I look to my left.  There's a VPD squad car with two VERY amused constables looking in my direction and motioning that I need to pull over.\n  \nWell, this is going to be interesting, I can just see it.  So the light turns green, and I pull onto a side street, roll down the window and get my papers in order.\n\nConstable #1 comes to the Driver's side, and Constable #2 is covering the right-rear of my vehicle.\n\nMe:  Good evening Officer, what can I do for you?  \nC1:  Sir, have you had anything to drink tonight?  \nMe:  Aside from two Cokes with dinner, not a thing.  \nC1:  Do you know why we asked you to pull over?  \nMe:  Umm... *maybe*...  \nC1:  What exactly were you doing when we saw you?  \nMe:  Um.  Air-Guitar...?  \nC1:  (He actually stifled a laugh).  Air-Guitar you say?  Sir are you on any drugs or medications?  \nMe:  No Sir.    \nC1:  Would you be willing to consent to a breathalyzer?  \nMe:  Yes, of course!    \nC1:  Allright.  Now, look.  It doesn't matter if you're at a stop light, you should always be aware of what's going on in traffic around you.  You didn't do anything wrong, but we just wanted to be sure you weren't on anything.  \nMe:  Ok, yes Sir.  I understand.    \nC1:  Okay then off you go.  Have a good evening.\n  \nAs I carefully drove away, I glanced in the rear-view and could see the two of them laughing.  Quite hard.\n  \nOh the story they must have told to their mates at the station that night.  Glad I could be of service, lads.\n\n*Edit:  I should have mentioned that I was in my late 30's at the time in full business attire, and driving a nicer than average car, so I guess from their perspective it must have looked strange as hell.",

        "text": "A very short encounter I once had with an officer, but lets me provide a little background first.\n\n\nI live in a pretty big city with a big state school in it. School is located in a semi high crime area, various levels of danger depending on how far you go down certain streets and what time. I lived in a relativley safe area, at least for a young male, so long as I dont go wondering around in the middle of the night. For reference I once looked out my windows at 4am to a police helicopter flying around with its spotlight, as well as 6 cop cars right in front of my house, and many officers running through me and my neighbors yards and the alley out back. So obviously the cops have actual crime to care about, and would rarely break up college parties or really care about petty crimes and what not. Also the area is an old neighborhood from the late 1800s with long skinny houses very close to each other, most everyone has gates and fences around their yard too.\n\n\nSo, fast forward to this certain night, it was 10 or so at night and I decided to step out in my backyard to smoke a joint, so I'm out back sitting in my chair browsing my phone, j in hand, when all of a sudden I see a light in the back alley flash my way, accompanied by someone saying some words I can't understand. I quickly realize this shady figure behind a big mag light is a cop and I start freaking out a bit, \"Come again?\" I reply to him, placing the joint down on the chair next to me. \"Can I get through here?\" he replied, pointing his light to my front gate between the houses, (my back gate was open and he walked up, most of my neighbors have their backyards completley sealed off with no way though) \"Yeah sure\" I said back to him. I turned around and started leading him to the gate which I had to open because there was a trick to getting it open from the backside. As were walking up I see him flash his light on the chair I placed the joint on, but he says nothing and follows me. I open the gate for him, and as he walks out front to his car he says, \"Thanks. Stop smoking weed outside.\" \n\n\nI was in awe. Immediately went back to finish it real fast, afraid he would come back and check up on me to make sure I wasn't still outside. About 30 seconds later I see headlights coming up in the alley, throw the J and scurry inside. Peeking out the window I watched as my neighbors car drove through the alley to their parking spot. I realize the cop could care less.\n\n\nI think the funniest part about this to me was that he didnt tell me to stop smoking weed, its that he said to stop smoking week *outside.*\n\n\nAnyways. This reason and more are why I love my cities cops, and always argue with people who say \"fuck cops\" and all that. ",

        "text": "I had been an explorer for about 6 months, and I was at a slow station. My adviser suggested I go ride out with a very busy station to stay interested. I was able to ride with a friend of the family that was also one of my tac' staff at the explorer academy. He had always been a mentor and friend. I was only 15 so I could only ride out till 2200, and for 8 hours. I started the shift at 1400. It was about 2000 hours when we got the call.\n\nWe had a few \"BS\" calls before we decided to go and eat. I remember eating in the call when we got the call. It was a 5150 eval, all the info we had was \" SUBJ BELIEVED HBD (Under the influence.), BLEEDING FROM STOMACH.\"  at a residence. We throw away our trash and begin heading that way. As were about 15 minutes out, dispatch updates tiburon. \"SUBJ NOW FIGHTING WITH FAMILY IN THE STREET.\" (Caps for MDC) We begin to roll unofficial code 3, which is lights no sirens unless you need to clear an intersection. New update from Dispatch \" SUBJ JUST JUMPED OUT A WINDOW, STILL FIGHTING WITH FAMILY.\" We begin rolling official code. The deputy advised me not to shine my light in the mans eyes because if he was under the influence of PCP or bath salts it may cause the man to freak out.\n\nAs we pull up another unit pulls up on the opposite side of the altercation with his lights shining on the fight. We jump out and begin walking up to the fight. We start to see a shadow start running towards our police car. I begin to back up (I was honestly scared out of my mind.) The deputy draws down and begins yelling at the man to stop and get on the ground. He doesn't stop, he's progressing on the unit quick. The deputy yells to me to grab the Mini-14. I could barely grab it from the shaking. I finally got it unlocked and cocked it, it was ready to fire. By this time the deputy and I are behind the doors of the unit, yelling at this guy. (This all happened in a matter of minutes.) The man got about 10 feet in front of our car, and I was slowly applying pressure to the trigger, I was waiting to hear the deputy shoot before I shoot this guy. He's about 5 feet in front of our unit now. The best way I can describe what happens next is \"Holy fuck\". The man collapsed in front of our car. I honestly thought I had accidentally shot the guy, I even looked over my gun. The deputy and I begin to approach the man down. He tells me to cover him, by this time I was about to drop the gun from my hands shaking so much.  No shots were fired. \n\nThe deputy rolled him over and checked his pulse, there was no pulse. Per policy we have to do CPR till a trained medical technician arrives. I set the Mini down and help with Chest compressions. AMR arrived a few moments later, they take over CPR for a few moments before they establish that he is in fact dead. I rack the mini and sit in the car. The deputy sits down and looks to me, we both sighed and said \"Holy fuck.\" I was 15 at the time, it's safe to say, reality hit me hard that night.  \n\n[EDIT: There was no shots fired, he collapsed in front of our car. I still havn't found the cause yet, AMR though that he had a heart attack.]",

        "text": "My First time experiencing a dead body as while with a Department wasn’t exactly what I thought it would be, first time I ever saw a dead body was while I was twelve years old visiting my Mom and siblings in their neighborhood known for gang violence, drugs, and shootings. I witnessed a Homicide at the age of 12, a male shot and killed off of his bike by another male, all over an argument. I remember seeing the POS that shot him walk away calmly and continue his conversation with his friend as if nothing happened, not a care in the world as if it was natural to kill someone while on a walk. \n\nThe incident I want to tell you about today happened 9 years after that incident, in a small town in rural Oregon. It was a beautiful, sunny spring afternoon, spots of white clouds, and a clam enjoyable wind (For once it wasn’t raining). We were sitting in a high traffic area checking for speeders, and attempting to be proactive in the small town. Sirens began to wail as Fire and EMS rolled Code to something, we got on the radio to dispatch to find out what was going on. \n“707 to Dispatch, what is Fire rolling to?” asked my buddy James (Not his actual name).\n“Dispatch to 707, going to a welfare check”. Came the crackled response.\n“Copy, can you show 707 assisting on the welfare check”?\n“Copy, 707 assisting at welfare at 1343”.\n\nJames began following EMS to the apartment of a male, who family hadn’t heard from for a week, and they were worried. As we pull in, EMS stages as we approach for a knock and talk. James approaches the door and knocks announcing himself.\n\n“Town Police”. James yelled through the closed door.\n\nNo response from inside the apartment. An odor I had only smelled a few times before when I came across a dead animal in the woods faintly hit my nose. James looked at me, as he noticed I was recognizing the smell of death.\n\nAgain, James knocks “Town Police, can you come to the door, if you don’t we will force entry”.\n\nJames sends me on a walk around to check windows and doors around the apartment, all of them are locked, and there’s no way to see inside. I call the R/P back who is the Males Mom and ask her what kind of vehicle he owns. She gave me the plate and the type of vehicle which I noticed parked right next to our patrol car. I told her we will be in touch after we make contact.\nA older Sergeant who looked like he’s seen everything that can happen in his career, rolls on scene to assist and go over what we were legally allowed to do at this point. \n\n“What’s going on here”? Sgt. Asks.\n\n“Well, we have a welfare check, the male identified as Rick isn’t answering, and we’re trying to determine course of action from here, planning to boot the door as we can smell something coming from inside but we can’t see in”. James responds.\n\n“That could be an option, what does the scent smell like James?” Sarge asked.\n\n“Death sir, it smells like a dead body”. James responded\n\n“Have you tried the door to see if it’s unlocked?” Sarge asked, almost factually.\n\nJames stops, and realizes that he has not yet done that.\n\n“No sir, I have not”. James responded astonished he hadn’t thought of doing that.\n\n“Well then, go try the door, we have enough to believe that there is something wrong inside the apartment based off of your sensory, as well as the subjects vehicle being parked here”.\n\nJames, Sarge, and I begin our approach and take tactical positions around the door. James grabs the handle and it turns, opening to the worst, nastiest, gag producing stench I have ever had the displeasure of entering my lungs… it’s not even that, it’s the fact that I could taste it on my tongue, holy balls it was horrible. I didn’t vomit, don’t know how I didn’t but damn!\n\nEveryone began coughing as we pushed in and called out for Rick. As we entered we found him, sitting in his chair, eyes wide open, his top half pale as snow, his bottom half, mainly feet and legs a dark Galaxy Blue/Purple/Black color. His body laid there, for a week with no one checking on him and it definitely smelled like it had been there a full week. \nWe began setting up crime scene tape (it was natural causes, a heart attack, but since that was unknown all bodies are treated as a crime), as EMS and Coroner entered into the apartment. James and I exited the apartment as the Sheriff’s Office arrived on scene with forensics and James. I remember looking past the tape, at a group of concerned individuals staring past us into the apartment. I remember seeing the woman ask \"How is my son, is my son in there, is he okay?\" I remember seeing the look on her face as she's asking these questions, and being able to read that she knows the answer already, but needs to hear it from us. I remember walking past, and to our idling car.\n\nSarge, and I began discussing what was inside. \n\n“you guys okay, FS9 is that your first body”? Sarge asked.\n\n“No sir, I’ve seen bodies before, but I’ve never smelled a human body”. I responded\n\n“Well, that stench doesn’t get much worse than that, surprised you didn’t vomit in there”. Sarge joked\n\n“Hey, FS9, what are you hungry for?” James snickered hoping I’d gag.\n\n“Well, he had a burger on the counter that he didn’t eat, and I was thinking that sounds pretty damn good at this point”. I responded very serious.\n\nJames coughed and gagged at my response. In short, I ended up getting a burger an hour later, while James tried to calm his stomach.. ",

        "text": "It was a quiet night. Most of us had just checked in at the station in the wee hours of the morning to start paperwork and generally just shoot the breeze until check-off. Football was blaring on the TV, and most of the guys were huddled in front of the screen, occasionally jumping from their chairs and pumping their fists in celebration at random intervals.\n\nI was sitting towards the back entrance that led out to the cruiser depot with my former FTO Jerry, as he went over several key points he forgot to mention during our month together on midnights. Jerry was only a few years older than me, but had moved up through the ranks quickly to attain the coveted FTO status. He was a no-nonsense type of dude, always coming down hard on the rookies and veterans alike for shenanigans and nonsense.\n\n\"So when you go to booking, make sure you get your cuffs back. We've lost more than a few pairs down there...\" He breathed out slowly in a long and exaggerated sigh. The city police did our transports to the district station, and several officers had forgotten various pieces of equipment during the booking process: handcuffs, weapons in the check-in station, cell phones, notebooks, etc. It was another pet-peeve of Jerry, who was so careful and meticulous about equipment accountability that it was sickening.\n\nAnother one of the FTO's, Gloria, sat down next to Jerry with a plop. Gloria was our senior by at least thirty years, and was more of a grandmother to all of us than our senior officer. She cared about us like we were her own children, always lending an ear or a piece of advice to our wayward souls, or just providing some nice country cooking to us who forgot to pack lunch for the day. \n\nShe carefully unpacked her lunchbox, and offered me some, which I declined. I was currently working on hour twelve of sixteen, and was cruising on caffeine and bad sugars. I felt a trip to the bathroom would be in order before check-off.\n\n\"Also, make sure you check in with the Sergeant before you go downtown to make sure he knows where you are...\" his voice trailed off as the football sailed in to the endzone and was hauled in by the offensive receiver for a touchdown. The break-room exploded in to cheers and claps for joy. One poor soul in the corner quietly buried his face in to his knit cap and began slowly edging towards the exit.\n\nGloria was bent over her shoulder with her ear pressed to her microphone. Was there a call? I turned the volume up to hear a voice on the other end shouting excitedly on the other end.\n\n\"Post 212, Coms! Get some units over here ASAP! We have a fire on one of the upper floors! Send Rescue!\" I looked at Jerry and Gloria, both had their best \"Oh Shit!\" faces on. In unison, the entire break-room immediately jumped to their feet and bolted out the back door.\n\nGloria and Jerry both gunned in to the closest cruiser, and I barely jumped in to the back seat before Jerry had the cruiser rocketing down the street, lights and sirens blaring. I watched as the cruiser sharply hit a corner at around 50 mph, the back door still open, my feet dangling towards open space and the pavement.\n\n\"Jerry! Slow down! You're going to kill us! Kik! Get the fuck in!\" I stopped for a moment, Gloria never cursed before in her life. I hauled my seatbelt on and slammed the door shut as Jerry rocketed down the street.\n\nWe pulled in front of the building, a massive 12 story structure situated on the edge of campus. Smoke was pouring from a window on Side A of the building on the 12th Floor, and bright orange flames licked the inside of the window. Jerry barely had the cruiser in park before we were all out of the vehicle running towards the building. Several cruisers of neighboring agencies and the city police lined the street, with several dozen officers running towards the building.\n\nThe poor security guard at the front desk was running back and forth, trying to keep tabs on the various agencies running in to the building and hitting the stairwells and elevators to reach the 12th Floor. The Fire Alarm hadn't sounded yet, an observation I made as I realized that the 3000+ residents weren't streaming out of the building.\n\nAnother officer, Eric, ran up to the security guard at the desk \"Hit the fire alarm! Get everyone out!\" He ran past me as I followed, Jerry in close pursuit. Gloria stayed behind to help with the evacuation and operations commenced immediately.\n\nWe made our way up through the thrall of 3000 students trying to quickly exit the building. The disparity was even more real by the fact that thick black smoke was now travelling down the stairwells. People were screaming, the alarms were blaring. One poor couple, probably in the midst of a sensual evening, were trying desperately to keep a bedsheet over their nudity as they carefully made their way down the stairs.\n\nWe reached the 12th Floor and were immediately assaulted with thick black smoke. Residents were hurriedly collecting their belongings and running down the stairs. Several other officers from the city police were kicking in doors to several apartments, herding the groups that had sheltered in place out of the building. Jerry and I had just kicked in one door on the back side when Eric shouted over the radio \n\n\"44 Nora, 33 Sam to side A I got the room!\" We hauled down the hallway to the end where Eric was standing in front of a door that smoke was billowing from the cracks on the edges. We ran up to it and Jerry put his hand on the door \"Cold!\" he shouted. With one movement, he reached back with his strong foot and put 6' and 200 pounds of pure muscle in to the door. It barely moved in the frame. Again he slammed in to it, again it held. Eric was of similar build, and both began assaulting the door at the same time to break it in while I ran down the hallway to get assistance.\n\nA few other city officers were busy working on other apartments. I grabbed one by the shoulder who was holding a crowbar and dragged him towards the burning apartment. He put the edge of the crowbar in to the lock-style of the door and gave it a strong pull. The frame of the door gave way and the door barely cracked open. More smoke poured from the room. \n\nSomething was behind the door, and blocking it from being opened. Being the smallest of the group, I wedged myself in between the doorframe and shouted inside \"Anyone in there?!\" Silence. I looked down and saw a large dresser, as big as me, blocking the door. Obviously, someone’s in there. I shouted to Jerry, who began kicking the door again while I tried to push the dresser away from the door. After several more attempts, we were able to push the dresser from the door and swung the door open.\n\nThe room was cinders. Everything was either on fire or ashes at that point. On the far side of the room, a body lay in the center of the bed. The top sheets were mostly black soot, but the bottom sheets were mostly intact. Myself, Jerry, and Eric all grabbed corners of the bedsheets and wrapped the patient in the bedsheets, hauling him off the bed. In a carefully modified Reeve Stretcher maneuver, we carried him out of the room and down the stairs. Other officers on the floor swarmed the room and made sure no one was inside before continuing the evacuation.\n\nWe made way down the stairs and carried the patient out to a waiting ambulance. By some miracle, he was alive. The EMT's on the bus immediately bagged the patient and prepped him for transport to the trauma center for 3rd Degree burns over a large portion of his body. Myself, Jerry, and Eric all took to the side and collapsed in a heap. The responding engine companies all rushed us and pumped fresh oxygen in to us with free rebreathers. We were a mess of tears, snot, coughing and hacking from severe smoke inhalation.\n\nTwo hours later, the fire had been knocked down by the fire department, and the Arson Investigators had begun their investigation. Day work had come on duty at that time, and began to cycle out the midnight’s crew that had been on scene since the beginning. Departmental admin had come on duty as well, and ordered a debrief after our units were free. We piled in to the large conference room. The whole room smelled of burning wood and charcoal. Jerry was still coughing occasionally, and I was attempting to keep myself awake in the corner.\n\nThe Four Horsemen (Chief, A-Chief, Captain, Special Ops Lead) piled in to the room and stood at the front. “All of you did a great job. I’ve been informed the young man who was in the room is stable and is expected to live. Kik, Eric, Jerry? Congratulations for a job well done. Come up front.” The three of us went up front and accepted letters of commendation and handshakes from Admin. After the clapping and cheering subsided, the other members on scene left to get sleep and to go home, except us. We were told to stay.\n\nThe Chief took a stern look at us and shook his head “While you guys did a good job, I just want to remind you guys of the SOP on personnel evacuations of buildings that have active fires…” He trailed off as the A-Chief passed us three copies of the SOP. “You guys know better. You could have been hurt or killed. And because the University Admin has gotten wind of this, you three are being issued Reprimands for failure to evacuate in a timely manner.” We took our letters in disbelief, all three of us just looking at each other, dumbfounded.\n\nWith that, the Chief stood up and smiled. “So, consider yourselves warned for doing something stupid, but also consider that a commendation of this caliber trumps the reprimand, so after 30 days, you can get it removed from your files. But, just don’t mess up again in 30 days!” He laughed. We didn’t; it was the most awkward and surprising moment of our careers.\n\nAfter we said our goodbyes and checked off, the three of us went to breakfast. Sitting in the booth smelling of burning wood, the waitress taking our order noticed the smell, the tactical pants, and coats.  “You guys firefighters?” she asked. We just shook our heads. “Just a bunch of hungry morons.” Jerry said sipping his coffee. Her puzzled look made us think of a better response. “Hungry morons who like to play with fire.” Eric said. I laughed, Jerry sighed, and the puzzled waitress shook her head and walked away. Luckily, a SWAT team didn't descend on us to haul us in for suspicion of Arson. Probably would have been too tired to do anything about it.\n",

        "text": "First off I apologize for my story telling, I am not the best, but anyways...\n\n\nSo this is a funny story that happened to me a couple years ago in college. Me and a few my friends lived in a house together about a mile off campus from a pretty big state school, and our house was used as one of our party houses among our fraternity. I have a few stories about cops coming and breaking up parties, but this one always gives me a good laugh.\n\n\nSo around one in the morning, everyone freaks out yelling \"Cops! Cops!\" and people go hide upstairs, in the back yard, etc as the majority of them are under 21 and dont want citations (never have I seen citations given at a house party in my college life.) Now at this point me and one of my roommates go up to talk to the cops and figure out what we need to do. \n\n\nThe cops come in and are super cool, explain they have to come because they got a noise complaint but since it's out first time they wouldnt do anything and it wasnt a big deal because they have actual crime to worry about in the city and not some college kids. So we are talking to them normal, explaining how we are gonna try to get everyone home blah blah blah. Then the cops reveal to us that they \"just scared the shit out of some freshmen.\" \n\n\nNow let my  introduce you to my friend, lets call him Soup. Soup was a freshmen in our fraternity, very nice, humble, fun guy. He was pre-med, very smart always got good grades, didnt drink much until college. Anyways, apparently when the cops first showed up, he was outside on our  front porch, and the cops had given him a talking to before they came in.\n\n\nThis is how it went down according to Soup.\n\n\nCop: \"How old are you?\"\n\nSoup: \"uhhh eiggghtteeen?\"\n\nCop: \"Alright son I'm going to ask you one question, answer it right and you'll be going home tonight, answer it wrong and you'll be coming to jail with us. Have you been drinking tonight?\"\n\nSoup: \".......... yes...\"\n\nCop: \"Alright now I'm going to need you to sit down right here and not move while we go inside, if you move were taking you downtown.\n\nSoup told us later that after they went inside he really had to pee and was peeking in the door to make sure they weren't looking as he peed off the porch, still scared shitless.\n\nMy roommate and I are currently cracking up with the police about all this, and they are just having fun with it. Nothing came of it and they left, but whenever our parties do get broken up they always come and are very cool about it. In fact this night my roommate and I had gone as Walter White and Jesse and although I have since moved out, they still refer to my friend as Walter White when they see him.",

Long story short, I got caught doing something stupid at a local supermarket and got the cops called.\n\nEnter Officer.\n\nHe asks me about what I was doing, who else was involved, do I have anything in my pockets that could hurt him, etc. Then comes the really scary part for teenage me.\n\n\"Okay, son, put your hands on the counter.\" \n\nHe grabs my right hand and puts it behind my back. *clickclick*\n\n\"Wait, what?\" \n\nGrabs the other hand. *clickclickclick*\n\n\"Hey, no!\" \n\nHe turns me around to escort me to his car.

I go up to the desk.\n\n\"Excuse me. Is it okay if I go to the bathroom?\" \n\n\"Sure, it's that door right there.\" \n\nOkay, great. I've been holding it for about two hours now, so this is a welcome relief. I open the door, which is made of steel and must be the heaviest door ever made, and let it shut behind me.\n\nSkreeeee-KSSH! \n\nI look around. There's not much to look at. And everything's made of steel. \n\nNow, this is a sit-down job, and I'll be damned if I trust a jail toilet with my behind, so I put down so much toilet paper that it felt like I was sitting on puffy clouds. I kick the paper in, flush, and thank the lord, it goes down.\n\nBut then it starts to climb back up! Two inches from the top! \n\nDamn damn damn. I panic. I'm going to be charged with vandalizing government property for sure! I turn in circles, I grab my hair. And eventually I give up and walk out to the clerk at the desk.\n\n\"Excuse me. Um, sir? I'm...I'm really sorry, but I accidentally clogged your toilet.\" \n\nHe lets out a big sigh.\n\n\"...Oh Jesus...Give it five minutes and then go flush it again.\" \n\nI wait. I go back in and flush. And it goes down. But then it comes right back up again! Quarter inch from the top! I am ever so screwed! I go back out, pretend nothing happened, go back in, and thank goodness, it goes down once and for all.\n\nAnd when I told my principal that story, I kid you not, he said to me, \"Way to go! Let 'em know you've been there!\"",

A call for a \"Low Priority Robbery\" popped up in our area, so we bought the call with a click of a button.\n\nComputer read:\n‘R/P (Ms. Smith) is stating she gave Christopher $20 to go to the store and purchase cigarettes for her, Christopher didn't return until 3 hours later, with no cigarettes and no money R/P Would like to press charges for the theft’. \n\n\"Shit, another possible soon to be domestic over $20 and some cigarettes\". Steven stated with a sigh of annoyance.\n\"This is an hour old, I'm sure things have calmed down I hope\".\n\nArriving on scene two minutes after acknowledging the call, and meeting up with a backup Officer Michael on scene. We approached the house. Listening before we knocked we heard someone talking, sounded like only one person, possibly on the phone as we could not hear any responses coming from inside. \nSteven knocked on the door, that very distinct Police knock.\n\n\"City Police\". Steven halfed yelled through the door.\n\nThe sound of shuffling feet came from the other side, followed by continuing conversation, and grunts. As the door opens smoke can be seen slowly pouring out of the front door, the smell of cigarette smoke hits my sinuses like a two ton truck hitting a powder blue prius (God do I hate Priuses). \n\n“Thank god you are finally here” our Ms. Smith gasps, “Christopher took my money that I gave him to buy me smokes, and when he came back three hours later didn’t have the money and didn’t have any smokes. I want his ass arrested right fucking now”!\n\n“Well hold on a minute Ms. Smith, we will see what the story is and find out what crimes were committed, can you tell us what happened”? Steven asked.\n\n“I sure as hell fucking can, this ass hole piece of shit mother fucker stole my $20 I gave him to go to the store down the block and get me some GOD DAMNED smokes, I want his ass arrested”. Ms. Smith stated.\n\n“Okay, well did he come back with anything?” \n\n“Nope, came back empty handed and asking for food”.\n\n“Does, Chris have a drug problem or drinking problem of any kind”? I asked.\n\n“Not that I know of, but I’m sure he probably spent it on Marijuana, or whatever the fuck kids are doing today. Listen Pig, are we gonna stand around here all day yapping or are you going to arrest this little fucker?” Ms. Smith barked.\n\n“Sure Ma’am, where is Chris right now?” I asked.\n\n“In his room probably curled up on his bed.” \n\n“How old is he?” Steven asked.\n\n“I think he’s four years old now…”. Ms. Smith said, sounding unsure.\n\nAll of us make eye contact with each other, and myself and Michael decide to investigate further into the house and see if we can make contact with Chris. We approach the room that Ms. Smith indicated belonged to Chris. I began to knock and announced who I was through the door. \n\n“Officer FS9, with the City Police, can you open the door and talk to me?”\n\nWe received no response.\n\n“City Police, we just want to hear your side of the story about what happened today Boss”. Michael stated with fake concern in his voice.\n\nAgain no response.\n\nI motioned to Michael that I was going to open the door, Michael drew his Taser and I opened the door with a push to not be in the line of fire.\nBoth step in, quickly clearing the room with a bit of shock starting to set in. \nLaying on the bed was a black and gray cat, the entire room was full of cat fur, a litter box in the corner, scratching posts, and cat toys all over the room, it looked like it was a Cat heaven or something. We cleared under the bed, cleared the closests, and cleared the bathroom inside the bedroom. All clear no one inside. Michael and I clear the rest of the house and don’t locate anyone. Completely confused on the situation Michael and I report to Ms. Smith that no one is inside and we can’t locate Chris anywhere. \n\n“He’s on the bed in his room, I made sure he stayed there and didn’t try to run from you when you got here”. Ms. Smith stated.\n\nI excused myself, a lingering suspicion on my mind and reentered the room the cat was in.\nI once again cleared the room checking every corner and approached the cat and read his collar “Christopher Smith”…\n‘You have got to be kidding Me’. I thought to myself.\n\nI picked Chris up and walked with him to my buddies as well as Ms. Smith.\n\n“YOU FOUND HIM!” Ms. Smith yelled.\n\n“I sure did Ma’am, I’m going to take him to the squad car for questioning ma’am, Michael can you assist me in detaining our subject”?\n\n“Affirm, I’ll assist” Michael stared at me, a look of disbelief and ‘You got to be shitting me’ look on his face.\n\nSteven cleared with the lady, and came outside about 2 minutes later. We came up with a gameplan now that we knew the lady was mental health, and that she needed some sort of end to this call that was peaceful.\n\n“I’m just going to go down to the store and purchase some cigarettes for her” Michael began “We can tell her Chris here forgot them at the store, and that he should never be trusted with money again”. \n\n“Good plan, let’s get this circus wrapped up”. Steven stated clearly pissed off and annoyed.\n\nSteven and I went back in while Michael and our detainee went down to the store, Steven and I told the woman what occurred and that Chris wasn’t old enough to buy cigarettes, and that he shouldn’t be trusted with money at all as he’s only four years old. Ms. Smith agreed with us and understood it was a bad idea all around. \nMichael returned with two packs of smokes and some change for Ms. Smith, we released Chris into her custody and decided to clear the call as long as she agreed that it was settled and there were no hard feelings. She hugged Chris, told him she was sorry for being mad as we walked out the door.\nAll I could think the rest of the shift was ‘What the actual fuck just happened’?",

        "text": "First of all, let me apologize in advance for any mistypes as I am currently writing this during a meeting at work about Cellphone use at Inappropriate times.. what a coincidence.\n\nIt was my first night out as a Police Cadet on patrol with another full time Officer in a big city. I clocked on with dispatch at 2000 hours to begin tour. \n\"7727 to Dispatch, show me 10-11, 10-8, 10-19\".\n\n\"Copy, 7727 at 2000\".\n\nI meet up with my Partner for briefing, let's just name him Steven for privacy and policy reasons.\n\nSteven and I are told about stolens to watch out for, what Day and Swing just dealt with, and any cause for concerns to watch out for during out shift. The night started slow enough, a few calls for service from a domestic dispute, a crazy lady who stated her Cat stole $20 from her and didn't come home with any 'smokes', and a few stalled motorists to assist on the side of the highway. Slow, yet entertaining night. \nWhile cruising through a neighborhood sharing stories from things we had seen in our lives, dispatch interrupts with a hot call in progress. \"7727 and 7728 (partners call sign), we have a report of a teenager with a gun on the campus of local elementary school waving it around, no reports of any shots fired\".\nLights flick on and engine roars to life as I respond to dispatch \"Copy 7727 and 7728 in route\". \n\"Copy, 0148 hours\".\n\nAs we arrive on scene we black out the lights, and get out and approach in the shadows, like ninjas in a way, peering around every corner, slowly clearing the field and outbuildings before determining the area is clear, and locating plastic BB's from a Airsoft gun on the ground. About 10 minutes later we clear the call and again, adrenaline dump is over, and back to hoping to find some trouble.\n\n\"Hey, what do you say we start pulling traffic?\" Steven asks.\n\n\"Great idea, I'm bored to all shit, I've never seen this city so dead\". I respond.\n\nWe pull into a 7-11 near a normally busy road and begin watching traffic, about eight minutes into our hunt a dark red Chevy Tahoe blows the red light, and turns onto a residential street. We immediately pull out and attempt to gain on the erratic driver, as we approach and reach for the lights to light him up a strange feeling I had never felt before began in the pit of my stomach. Hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I felt like I could get sick. I looked at Steven who ended up making eye contact with me the same time I looked at him and we backed off without saying a word to each other. Falling back a good 100 yards, we radioed for backup on a erratic driver, and waited for him to come to a stop what we were hoping would be soon. As a backup Officer arrives behind us, the Tahoe pulls into a Winco parking lot where the driver casually walks inside. Pulling around to the back of the Tahoe I run the plate through our computer system, and alerts and tones begin to fill my ears with the Red Alert tone. Computer pops up with red written all over the screen \"Felony Warrant for Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Felony DV, Felon in possession of a firearm, Assault on a Police Officer, and Failure to appear\" all showed up on the system out of California. \n\"7727 to records, can you run for wants and warrants on the registered owner of a Chevy Tahoe State Plate ABC123 and check if they're extraditable\"?\n\n\"Copy 7727, stand by\".\n\nWhile records was checking on the warrants to make sure they were active and extraditable Steven and I decided to approach the vehicle and check inside while our subject was still inside.\n\nPeering inside we notice a handgun in the center console cup holder. Now I was understanding the tension and feeling my body had signaled earlier. \n\"Dispatch to 7727\".\n\"Go for 27\"\n\"Your subject comes back with active warrants out of neighboring State, and they are extraditable\".\n\"Copy, that, we will be making contact in a few. Any other available units to back us up on a felony warrant arrest?\"\n\"Copy, two additional are in route to your location\".\n\"Copy, thank you\".\n\nAs more backup Officer's arrived on scene (now having 7 Officers) we took up positions around the entrance and exit doors of the Winco Foods, and waited for our subject to exit. 15 minutes of standing, and getting strange concerned looks from civilians passing by, our subject steps out the sliding doors and is taken aback by immediate arm bars, taser dots, and multiple orders of \"GET ON THE GROUND NOW\"! With full compliance, and not even the thought of a struggle from him a felony warrant arrest couldn't have gone any smoother.\n\nI've never had my body warn me of a possible future event, never had it warn me of possible danger, I now believe that if we had stopped that subject when we did, it would have cost us our lives, or left us badly wounded in a gun battle with our subject. The human body is an amazing tool, and I now have the utmost respect for what it's capable of. ",

Not a whole lot ever really happens.I work for a call center and we rarely ever have to call the police.   Which is fine by me. That is until yesterday. I was driving along looking for anyone that is smoking, making out, or making a bomb. All of the sudden I hear a police siren behind me. \n\nI look behind me and sure enough there is a local police officer with his lights on. I pull over into an empty part of our lot and wait. I hear the officer's door open and close and he walks up to my cart. He asks for my licence and my guard card. I unzip my door and pass both of them to him. I ask him \"Is there a problem officer?\" He gives me a blank expression and walks back to his squad car. \n\nI sit in my cart thinking about anything and everything that I could have done wrong. A minute later he walks up to the cart and hands me everything back. \"You're free to go.\" he says to me as I zip the cart door back down. \"Why did you pull me over officer?\" I asked with a puzzled face. \"Well when the opportunity to check something off your bucket list you have to take it.\" He smiled at me and turned around and drove away.",

        "text": "“So, meet you over at 7-11?” Tony was walking away from the upscale townhouse we had been dispatched to, back towards his idling cruiser parked at the curb. \n\n“I don’t know, man. You think that’s all we should do?” The call had been routine, check the welfare of a man in his fifties. The caller, whose physical distance away from the homeowner matched the distance of their relationship, was insistent something was wrong but unable to come check himself for a few days. \n\n“C’mon. What’re we gonna do? Kick in the door? The guy’s probably off banging hookers and doing blow! I’m not making the call to violate his privacy.” Tony was now unlocking his cruiser door.\n\nI took another look around: Piled up newspapers, mail spilling out of the small box by the front door, almost-new Mercedes sitting in the driveway – I had a feeling this guy was home.\n\n“Hold up and let me knock a few more times!” I called to Tony. He rolled his eyes and shook his head in response before returning to the ever-present glow of the in-car computer. I pounded on the door again and leaned in, hopeful to hear the distant thump of footsteps that would herald my departure and subsequent trip to a hot coffee. My hopes were dashed, however, by the deathly silence that had been present the first dozen times I had knocked. I ran down the mental check-list of things to do in a case like this. Tony and I were fresh out of field training, both still doubtful of our skills and our only points of reference for decision making being the jaded field trainers we had finally been unleashed from. \n\nI knew Cole would have barked at me to hurry up and hump to the next call. Tony’s trainer would have echoed the sentiment. Apparently Tony was a faster learner than I because he was in the same mindset – move on after doing the minimum necessary. My mental checklist failed me so, reluctantly, I returned to my cruiser. \n\n“About time!” Tony called from inside his car. His engine roared to life, its ancient belts whining in protest. \n\nI looked back at the house over the roof of my car while I fumbled with my keys. That’s when I noticed the balcony: second floor, directly over the front door. It was small with a wrought iron railing, and the door was cracked open. \n\nTony was pulling away but I quickly called to him over the tactical channel on our radio. “Hey, come back here real quick.”\n\nHis car’s brake lights lit and the cruiser lurched to a stop. The red light shining back at me probably matched his mood and was interrupted by the white lights of his reverse indicators. He zipped back, parallel to me, then rolled down his passenger window and looked up at me with a contemptuous gaze. “Yes?” He asked, breathy and annoyed.\n\n“The balcony; the door’s open.” \n\nTony bent lower, assessed the balcony, and then sighed. “So? How are you gonna get up there Spiderman?”\n\n“I don’t know, give me a boost?” \n\nTony rolled his eyes aging and slumped back in his seat. “A boost? You? If you haven’t noticed I’m a one hundred and twenty pound Korean dude. You’re a two hundred and twenty pound hunk of Aryan meat. I’m not boosting your fat ass anywhere.”\n\n“Well, I think we need to check further on this guy. I guess I’ll call the boss.”\n\nTony was taken aback, not by my insistence with delaying his coffee break but for an entirely different reason: a rookie calling the boss was a firmly entrenched “no-no” in our newly issued, informal rule book. “You’re really going to do this? Call the boss over a welfare check?”\n\nI paused and mulled over my options. I truly felt like the guy was either in danger or worse. I’d put my short career on the line and risk the tongue lashing for doing so. “Yeah, hang out a minute.” I unlocked my door and ignored Tony’s scoffs while I checked the computer to see where the lieutenant was. He had just marked out at the station: easy to corner. I dialed the number and spoke to the receptionist, asking for her to page the boss. He picked up a minute later. \n\n“Lieutenant Smith.” He didn’t sound happy. \n\n“Hey boss, EMR here. I have a quick question.” I waited, hoping his reply would seem more enthusiastic than his initial answer. The silence lingered.\n\n“Yeah?” He eventually asked.\n\n“Well, me and Tony are out-” Tony hissed at me from his car and made a waving gesture to indicate he wanted no part in my discussion with the boss- “at a house where a fifty-something year-old guy hasn’t been heard from in a week or so. Mail’s piled up, papers too. Car’s in the driveway, nothing visible through the windows we can easily see in. Neighbors haven’t seen him come or go – which they say is strange. There’s an open second story door that I might be able to get in but I wanted to check in with you first.” I tried to be as succinct as possible and spat out my summary in rapid fire. A silence lingered again at my finish. \n\n“Yeah? Well, good luck. Let me know.” \n\nIt was not the response I was expecting. “So? So, I should go in?”\n\n“If you’re saying you can justify it, yeah. Call if anything’s crazy. Leave a card if not.”\n\nI was slightly taken aback by how easy it was and thanked the Lt before hanging up.\n\n“So, coffee? Finally?” Tony pestered from his car. \n\n“No. Let’s find a ladder or something.” I closed my door and walked back to the house.\n\n“Really?!?” Tony yelled from the street.\n\nI walked around the back of the house again, this time less concerned with what was inside and hoping for some luck with the exterior. Under the deck, sitting on a pile of dirt, sat the object of my quest – an aluminum ladder. I pulled it out, trying and failing to keep the dirt off my uniform, and made my way back to the front. As I was setting it up, Tony came walking over.\n\n“I’m not going in.” He said.\n\n“What?” \n\n“I’m not going in there.”\n\n“Why not? Lt said we were good.” I was confused and Tony paused, looking away from me before answering.\n\n“I’ve… I’ve never seen a dead body.” He seemed ashamed. \n\n“Well, neither have I. But I’m still going in.”\n\nThe sounds of the freeway, a few hundred yards away, filled the void left by Tony’s lack of explanation. Finally, he began. “I’m not saying I’m scared. Just that… I don’t know.” He trailed off but I got the message. \n\n“It’s cool. If I make it down to the front door, will you come in then?” I figured he would say yes since if I made it that far without finding anything dead, chances were there was nothing to find at all. He nodded but was still reluctant to make eye contact.\n\n“Hold the ladder, pussy.” I tried to make it come out light but seemed to fail. Tony did as I asked though, and took his position as I climbed the rickety ladder. \n\nI hopped over the rail and drew my gun and flashlight. “POLICE!” I yelled through the door. I dipped and peeked inside the room, holding my light the way I was recently taught in the academy. The balcony entered into a living room. Nothing looked out of the ordinary or disheveled. I announced again and made my way to the split landing that went up to the third floor or down to the ground floor where Tony was waiting. I thought for a moment what the best thing to do was, and, in hindsight, probably made the wrong choice. I headed up stairs, gun trained ahead and flashlight tight in my non-dominant hand. I rounded the half wall at the top and announced once more to no response. There were three doors, all closed. Directly across from me was what I assumed was a bath-room based on how narrow the house was. To my left and right, down a hall either way, were two other doors. Bedrooms, I assumed. I chose to head right, creeping down the hall, heart pounding. I reached for the doorknob and it turned freely. I braced myself and flung the door open, entering with my gun and light up – scanning the room for danger or dead bodies. I found neither, just a lonely cat that immediately began purring and rubbing my leg. \n\nThe whole room was devoted to the cat – structures built in a horse shoe shape encompassing the perimeter allowed it to climb and play. There were several self-feeding food and water dishes, some less full than others. Three new looking litter boxes were well used and the burning ammonia smell emanating from them indicated they hadn’t been cleaned in some time. \n\nI exited the room and made my way back down the hall – clearing the bathroom on my way to the second bedroom. I announced one last time and tested the door knob – it turned freely as well. I was less worried this second time, believing now the evidence in the cat’s room indicated the homeowner was on a vacation, and the creeping feeling of shame began to well up: I was still an over-analyzing rookie. Maybe Tony was right from the get go. Was I that far behind him that I couldn’t see things his way?\n\nI turned the knob and pushed open the door with much less vigor than I had in the cat’s room. I was immediately struck by the foulest stench I had ever experienced. \n\nA single, dim yellow light was on in the corner. The TV was cycling the menu screen of some terribly produced porn movie. To my left: the bed. Lying on top of the covers was the first dead body I had ever seen. Discolored tighty-whiteys were the only article of clothing on the discolored body. He had a brown tinge all over except for the peaks of his mountainous belly and man-boobs which had a sickly-pale cream tinge. Dark purple pooled at the low points of his body – his back, elbows, thighs. His head was tilted back, off the pillow, and his eyes were crusted and lifeless. A stream of dried white spittle trailed out of his mouth and spread into the delta of his unshaven cheek. Empty pill bottles lay scattered on the bed and night stand. I backed out slowly, trying to hold my breath and only breathing through my mouth if needed. In the hall, I holstered my weapon and flicked on some lights. \n\nDeath was an ugly thing.\n\nI made my way, backwards, down the steps, keeping my gaze trained on the top of the stairs in case the corpse decided to reanimate. I skipped steps down the second flight, to the ground floor, and opened the door to find Tony pacing on the front stoop. \n\n“Well?” He asked. \n\n“He’s up there. Dead. Nasty.” I breathed in the fresh air and pulled out my phone. “Can you page the lieutenant again?” \n\nI explained the scene to the boss. He seemed annoyed but less at me than his job in general, and said to stand by while he called out crime scene and the investigations bureau – protocol for suicide investigations. When I hung up, I noticed Tony staring into the house.\n\n“Want to go see him?” I asked.\n\nTony turned and, after a moment, nodded. We made our way in, my ramblings about what we needed to do and the creaking of the stairs the only noises in the house. \n\n“So, one of us, at least, should stay in here with the body until we’re relieved. The other needs to set up a crime scene log and tape. I think the boss said he’d be over here when he was done with the phone calls and-“\n\n“What is that smell?!” Tony was covering his nose and looking aghast. The death stench had flowed down to the living room from the still open door. \n\n“I guess that’s the death smell everyone likes to joke about.” \n\n“That’s… that’s fucking gross!” Tony slowed as I led the way up the second flight of stairs. \n\n“He’s over here.” I indicated towards the dim yellow light spilling from the rear room and hoping Tony would take over lead. He did, reluctantly, and I followed a few steps behind. \n\nWhen he peeked in the door, his immediate, guttural reaction took me of guard: he jolted backwards and wretched before pushing by me and running down the stairs. I spun from his escape to the room and peeked in myself. The grey cat from the front room, apparently not happy with his dry Meow-Mix, had wandered into its former master’s room. It had leapt to the bed and was in the process of chewing off the body’s bloodless right index finger.\n\n“Shit.” I said aloud, causing the cat to turn and look at me.\n",

        "text": "Me and a friend had won a trip to visit a small gaming studio. It was his win but I got to tag along. We are a pretty matching set, really. Both tall nerds with long, unchecked hair and unshaven chins. As we stepped off the flight after about an hour on board, we both had old jeans with large, washed out t-shirts - similar ones I might add as they where gaming company shirts. What we noticed about the other passengers was that this was mostly a commuter flight with the same people flying back and forth. Most of these people was well dressed buisnessmen. \n\nThe stern lady at Customs took *one* glance at us and then pointed us to their office. \n\nWe shrugged and followed her inside, mostly curious at the procedure. As a young white male, I seldom if ever get stopped by Police and / or customs. And then things started to get interesting really quick. \n\nThey asked what we where going to do in the city. We answered truthfully. They did not believe us, they had never heard of the company and this was before the age of smart phones - we had no method of showing them our invitation mail with the details. Worse yet, we had no number to the person we where supposed to meet - They where waiting outside with a sign waiting to show us to the hotel. And we did not know the hotel either for that reason. \n\nAt this point, both me and him feel a bit pressured, especially me who hates being accused of lying, directly or indirectly. She orders me to put the bag down on the floor and then whistles. A terribly cute Cocker Spaniel is coming out of a dog pen in the wall and I forget everything else - I am a big animal person and have a special place in my heart for dogs. My mind goes \"oh, how cute. They got a dog with them at work!\"\n\nSo I do what I always do with dogs. I lean down and the Cocker Spaniel starts to sniff my face, lick it once after I scratch its ear and then it proceeds towards my bag without no further distraction. \n\nThat is when I understood what a dog was doing at a Customs Office. Standing quickly up, I see the customs officer smiling - the dog walking back to the pen and she tells us to enjoy our stay and sends us forth. To this day, I am very happy I did not have to unpack the bag. Trying to re-pack it all in a customs office would have been a nightmare. \n\nTL;DR: I got friendly with Officer Detection Dog and they let me off with a lick and a cuddle. ",

It's a cold rainy night and the only thing you can see on the road is fog. I'm dispatched to a \"routine\" (hate that word) discharge firearms call. I'm the closest car so I take it. Once on scene, I see what looks to be a on going domestic in the front yard. Bf is yelling at gf while holding a shot gun. (Instantly thinking \"that's what's causing the shots fired.\" I get out of my car, initially take cover and draw my weapon. I get the female to the back of my patrol vehicle and the POS runs back into the residence with the weapon. Now I'm thinking standoff. After about 15 minutes of waiting for another car (which was coming all along, just could barely see to drive) my at the time cpl shows up on scene. While filling him in, a call comes out in reference to a suspicious person in the front yard of another residence holding a shotgun. At this point, we figured out the POS made it out the back door and through the woods to the neighbors house. (Side note- the neighbor was supposedly sleeping with the gf). So, the cpl and I grab rifles and go in for the silent approach. When we reach the neighbors house, I go to the porch while covered and ask where is the guy. At this point, all me and the cpl hear is \"hold it right there\" coming from the woods beside us. At this time, we take our cover behind the vehicles in the driveway, and get light and eyes on the POS. he does as he is told and raises his hands, we haven't seen the shotgun...yet. While talking to the POS, he says he had to get briers from around his feet so he can come out. (Finger tightening on the triggers). When this happened, he attempted to raise the shotgun (which was hidden behind a tree beside him) and a trigger wound up snagging the trigger blowing his own head off. My cpl, looked over at me and said cover me, I'm going to check him. Being as young in law enforcement as I was all I could do was reply \"for what? Fuckers dead!\"  The whole ordeal was marked off as a Suicide, but even to this day... 3 years later, me and cpl believe he was raising the gun on us. Due to the way the gun went off. Mine may not be as funny as some of the other stories on this sub but it was one that'll stick with me until I retire. Moral of the story... This was the day I learned there is no such thing as routine. ",

        "text": "I am a College student at a D1 in Oklahoma. I had been in the library studying for about seven hours, the Adderall was wearing off, I was tired, sick, and it was cold outside. So this dumbass decides he and his buddies are going to spray me with waterguns from their truck as they drive by. Let the record show that I am no small guy, and I'm not just fat either. This guy really pissed me off because it was already cold out and some of the water got on my laptop.\n\nMy pick-up wasn't far away, so I hopped in it and started looking for this asshole. about twenty minutes of driving around campus and I spot him. but he is driving the opposite way of me. So, since we weren't on a busy street (I actually didn't see any other cars at all) I pull out in the middle of the road and stop. I was gonna kick this motherfuckers ass.\n\nWell, I think he knew what was going on because he started to slow down, and I stuck my head out the window. This brazen motherfucker squirted me again. \n\nNow, I had a reputation in high-school of being a bit hot-headed. Maybe a lot hot headed. I am usually pretty chill now but it comes out on occasion. The first time this guy hit me with the water gun, a switch flipped. we were gonna fight. I would've gotten my licks in and gone about my business. the second time he squirted me, I went into overdrive. I was damn near to seeing red. If he would have stopped, I would've put his ass on the ground and started kicking. He would've lived, but it wouldn't have been pretty.\n\nSo I'm seeing red, this motherfucker is driving down the road cackling with his buddies, and I have an injury to my ego. I flip a citch in the middle of the street and gun it on down the road toward him. all of a sudden, Blue lights in the rearview mirror. I don't know if police officers know this feeling, but Red White and Blue in the rearview have a magical power to immediatley turn me into the nicest, most respectful, law abiding citizen in the world. the cop walks up to my window and says the line. You know the line \"son, do you know why I pulled you over?\" I told him\" Yes officer, I believe I do\" and he says now why do reckon i did. So i say back to him \" well i figure it's because I made an illegal U-turn and was probably speeding.\" \"Well, that's spot-on. We got a regular genius here. Do you care to explain why you did that\" \" Well, you see officer, this guy in a truck squirted me with a watergun, and I didn't like that very much. I thought it could be dangerous. It could get in someones eyes, so I was tryng to get his license plate number so I could report him\" Long story short, I got away with it and the kid in the other truck ended up getting in trouble. I wish I could tell that cop thanks. He might have saved me some assault charges. ",

        "text": "“Well, there we go - looks like we’re about to have a fight.” I took the binoculars from my eyes to see the reaction of my driver and partner-of-the-day, Nick. He was too busy staring at the departing figure of a large framed woman stomping down the road.\n\n“Holy crap, check out Godzilla. How do you say Godzilla in Spanish?”\n\nAnnoyed, I brought the binoculars back up to check on the arguing duo of douche-baggery waving their hands at each other in front of the library, a good football field or three away from our hiding spot. “It’s still Godzilla, I think. I must’ve missed that class. Do you even care that the sole purpose of us being here, to prevent gang fights and ID as many of the new guys as possible, is being negated by your affinity for staring at human oddities?” The two young men were becoming more agitated. \n\n“Oddities? Have you looked around, dude? Everyone’s huge. It’s the new look apparently.”\n\n“Still, shouldn’t we be, oh, I’ don’t know, driving over there to stop a fight and ID those two turds?” Now I was getting annoyed. While not the sexiest assignment, I enjoyed gang intervention. To be able to counter some of the damage that gangs could inflict on the younger population was a noble goal. It took me taking down the binoculars a second time and an annoyed sigh and stare at Nick in order to get him to break his slack-jawed observation of the surrounding mega-fauna. \n\n“Fine, whatever, but we’re going to burn our cover if we drive up on them you realize.” Nick began to pull out of our spot, making his way through the apartment parking lot to the library. \n\n“Two uniformed cops in an unmarked, idling Impala is hardly deep cover. And in case you hadn’t realized, it’s not like we’re dealing with counter surveillance experts over here.” Nick just replied with a grunt and continued on. I kept a steady eye on the duo while marking out on the radio.\n\n“Four-bravo-eleven with a subject stop.”\n\n“Four-bravo-eleven go ahead.” The dispatcher answered. \n\n“Hold us out with two at Jefferson Library, we’ll be ten four, may need wants run in a minute.”\n\n“Ten four, fourteen thirty two.”\n\nThe kid facing us, decked out in red, had noticed our approach and calmed dramatically. He was obviously not new to the game we were playing and smirked ever so briefly at us over the shoulder of his smaller, blue clad opponent. We got out of the car and quietly made our way up to the pair, the whole walk punctuated by curses and jeering laughter from the guy with his back to us.\n\n“What, you can’t talk now pussy? You scared you little bitch? Fuck eighteenth street, faggot! You all a bunch of bitches!” He stepped back from his enemy, attempting some complicated hand gesture but was interrupted when he met the solid chest of Nick, standing statue-like just behind him.\n\n“Hey little guy!” Nick said, looking down on the now cowering gangster. “What’s up?”\n\n“N-nothin’ officer, just hanging out with my friend.” The kid pointed to his still smirking rival. \n\n“I don’t know that dude. He’s causin’ a scene out here.” The guy in red looked un-phased by our presence, in stark contrast to the almost tooth-chattering nervousness of the blue guy.\n\n“Well, let’s have a few words then. You-” Nick addressed the kid in blue, “Sit down. You, let’s talk back at the tree.” Nick nodded to me before walking the few feet away with the kid in red, confirming I was ok with being alone with the remaining little guy. \n\n“So, what’re you really doing out here?” I asked from behind Blue. \n\nHe jerked his head around and seemed startled by either the question or my presence. “Wha? Me? Nothing. Just talking is all.”\n\n“You usually attempt to throw MS13 hand signs in casual conversation?”\n\n“Nah, man. That wasn’t no gang sign. That was, like, just messing around.” He refused to make eye contact with me, instead focusing his laser concentration on a soccer game being played by a group of kindergarteners in a dusty lot across the street from us. \n\n“What’s your name?” \n\n“Why you need to know that? Am I being arrested or something?” He suddenly took a turn for the defensive and glared at me angrily. \n\n“No, not just yet. Just trying to figure out who I’m talking to is all. You can read my name.” I drew my finger across my name tag, slowly so he could keep up. “I just thought I was owed some equal standing.”\n\nHe clicked his tongue in annoyance and looked away. “Nah, man. You ain’t owed nothing.”\n\nA few moments of silence passed and I tried my best to bore a hole in his ill-fitting Yankees cap with my eyes. Nick was approached a minute later and jerked his head for me to meet him halfway.\n\n“Anything from baby-blue over there?” \n\n“No.” I replied. “He was super nervous then got all defensive when I asked his name. I was going to wait to turn up the heat until you were done. What’s his story?” \n\n“Mr. Lopez over there admits he is Eighteenth Street but that he didn’t start anything today – he knows the library is out-of-bounds. He said baby-blue came up and started trying to recruit his little brother while Lopez was signing up for the internet. He told blue to back off but never threatened him. Blue waited out here for him to leave and started trying to get him to fight. I’m going to go check with the librarians to see if that’s on the up and up.” He stomped away and I split my attention between the two gentlemen gangsters. Lopez was leaning against the tree close to me, kicking at acorns and looking like he’d rather be somewhere else. \n\n“You good?” I asked, more to break the silence than out of concern. \n\n“Yeah. I just think it’s bull that a fake gangster like that dude can cause me to be stuck here. He’s nothing, never seen him in my life. I didn’t want to start anything, he’s lucky I didn’t want to end it.”\n\nI glanced back at the kid in blue, still sitting on the curb of the parking lot and absentmindedly twirling some grass in his fingers like a bored kid on a youth soccer team. “Yeah, it’s bull, you’re right. We’ll be done here in a minute. Do we have your photo?”\n\n“Yeah, Sergeant Thomas took a fresh one last week.” Thomas was our gang coordinator and the fact Lopez dropped his name only further confirmed his status as an actual gang member.\n\n“Mind if I take another, just in case?” \n\n“Nah, go ‘head.” Lopez struck the pose – hat off, back against the tree and stared straight ahead, waiting for my crappy digital camera to do its job. Nick came back a moment later.\n\n“So?” I asked. \n\n“Lopez speaks the truth: librarian kicked out Blue because he tried to start another fight inside after the run in by the computers. She’s going to be out in a second so we can ban him.” Nick smiled and then went over to Lopez. “You can roll dude, thanks.”\n\nBlue immediately stood and protested. “What about me? I gotta go too. That ain’t fair man!”\n\n“Simmer down small fry.” Nick rolled his eyes at Blue. “You’re not done yet.”\n\nThe kid scoffed and collapsed back to the curb, muttering curses under his breath and picking more grass to entertain himself with. The librarian joined us a moment later and we performed an impromptu banning ceremony. Blue took it all in stride, rolling his eyes and continuing the inaudible curse words. When it was clear we were done, he stood and began walking away. \n\n“Whoa whoa whoa!” I called to him. “I still don’t have your name dude. Get back here.”\n\n“I don’t need to tell you nothing man.” He stopped walking but made no move to comply with my request to identify himself. \n\n“Really?” Nick started, obviously not a fan of Blue’s attitude. “Tell me more about what you don’t have to do. Maybe we can have a nice, long discussion while I drive you to jail?”\n\nBlue clucked his tongue once again. “You all pigs are bitches. Jose Gonzalez. Happy?” \n\n“Birthday?” I prodded, taking notes. He rolled his eyes but answered that and the rest of my questions concerning his identity. \n\n“Ok, now, time for a picture and you can take off too, speedy.” Nick raised his own crappy, department issued camera but before he could click, Gonzalez covered his face and ducked away. \n\n“No. No! Bad! You need to stay still, that’s not how this works.” Nick scolded him like a puppy.   \n\n“You can’t take my picture!” Gonzalez’ voice came muffled from the crook of his arm. \n\n“Can and will.” Nick countered. He paced to Gonzalez’ left, out of his field of view before calling. “HEY!” Gonzalez looked up in perfect timing with Nick’s * CLICK *. \n\n“Fuck y’all!” Gonzalez was furious. He spat in Nick’s direction but missed as Nick pulled his leg out of range. The gooey glob landed smack dab in the middle of the sidewalk, a physical manifestation of contempt of cop, glistening in the sun. \n\nMy time had come. “Have a seat.” I told him, calm but firm. His fists were balled and he swayed like a boxer for a moment but eventually complied. I quickly returned to our cruiser, gathered up my clipboard, and went back to the fuming gangster. \n\n“One moment, this is a new one for me…” I scratched out the necessary blocks on the citation. “Aaaaaand, here you go. Sign here, press hard, three copies.” I presented Gonzalez with his summons.\n\n“What the hell is this bull shit for?” He asked, spittle erupting from his mouth. \n\n“A ticket for “Expectorating in Public.” That means spitting. I just found it the other day while I was studying. I think you’ll be the first to be issued it in over a decade!” \n\n“Spitting? SPITTING?!?” Gonzalez’ fury grew. “You lucky my crew ain’t here, pig. We’d show you what’s up.”\n\n“Yeah, well, I seriously doubt you have a crew. Certain in-the-know people,” I nodded towards the tree where Lopez had been stationed before, “seem to think you’re not even a real gang member.”\n\n“La Mara for life!” He replied and signed the ticket. I gave him his copy and he crumpled it into a ball immediately upon receiving it. He then threw it up into the air in an act of defiance. \n\n“Oh sweet, hold on, another ticket for littering…” I flipped through my code book but Gonzalez quickly gathered his discarded paperwork and wandered away. \n\nNick and I watched him leave. As he turned the corner, Nick raised his fist and I readily bumped it.\n\nThe next morning after roll call, I made my trek though the station to find my cruiser, passing the interview rooms in the process. I noticed a familiar face: Gonzalez. He was handcuffed to the detainee bar on the wall, face bruised and lip bloodied. \n\n“Didn’t expect to see you again so soon!” I said in a too-loud voice, waking him from his snooze. \n\nHe awoke with a start and saw who it was who addressed him before clucking his tongue in annoyance and closing his eyes again. I turned to the midnight cop who had locked him up. “Jonesy! What’d Blue Boy over here do?”\n\nJones looked up from his paperwork. “Genius thought he’d smack an Eighteenth Street guy in the back of the head with a beer bottle; said he ‘disrespected him.’ Got his ass kicked for his effort. Looks like he’s got some immigration trouble now too.”\n\n“Eighteenth Street? Guy named Lopez maybe?” I guessed. \n\n“Yeah, you know him?” \n\n“Met him yesterday. Said this guy wasn’t a gang member. Guess he was wrong, huh?” \n\n“Well,” answered Jones, “he’s not a very good one, that’s for sure.” \n\nEyes still shut, Gonzalez clucked his tongue again. \n",

        "text": "Names changed to protect the innocent. I’ll refer to my partner in this story as Parks; while that’s nowhere near his real name, he can’t park a car to save his life and has a mini panic attack every time he has to reverse up somewhere. Absolutely lovely guy, very keen and great sense of humour, but parking is the bane of his existence.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nParks and I had been flat out all evening, job to job to job, no breaks in between. It was actually pretty good for him in a way; Parks was fresh from the academy, only about a month out, and I was trying to get him as much experience as possible. Having said that, we’d had a non-stop run of idiots for around the last 4 hours, and it was getting to the point where even I needed a breather.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n‘What’ve we got to choose from?’ I asked as we drove away from our last task. Parks scanned the list of jobs on the car’s computer screen, found a couple with the highest priority rating, and read out the codes.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n‘A domestic, or a mental health job… hmm… where’s the domestic?’ I asked, glancing at the screen. I caught a glimpse of the suburb as he replied, and cringed. ‘Oh god… what’s the actual address?’ ‘2 Smith Street… why, what?’ he replied, as I started laughing ‘Oh fuck that, no way. No way in hell.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nParks raised his eyebrows at me. ‘Can’t we just do the domestic? I don’t wanna deal with some crazy guy.’ I laughed at him again, ‘Fuck no man, I know those units at 2 Smith Street. We’ll go there, whoever called us will turn on us, we’ll cop abuse from the whole damn ungrateful family, and they’ll possibly throw stuff at us. And we’ll still have to try and put a report on.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI pulled the car over and tapped on the screen to bring up the text of the mental health job. ‘Ah, see, look at this, nice easy one. We go with some nurses to a house, let the guy know he’s got to come with us due to mental health concerns, maybe have a quick wrestle, then take him down to hospital. Easy.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThe gist of the job really was that easy. Mental health staff from the local hospital had gone around earlier that day to the house of a schizophrenic outpatient to see how he was doing. As it turned out, not so good; the gentleman had been extremely aggressive and was going through a psychotic episode. The staff member quickly got the hell out of there, and wrote up the legal forms authorising the apprehension and transport of the guy for the purposes of a psychiatric assessment. Police had been contacted by the hospital, requesting that we accompany 2 mental health nurses to the house and help with arresting the guy and taking him to hospital. The job had actually been on the system since about midday, and it was now around 8:30pm, but the district had been so flat out with higher priority jobs that no one had gotten around to it.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nParks directed a pair of very sad puppy dog eyes my way and tried one more time for the domestic, but a quick round of paper scissors rank soon put an end to that. We got the job dispatched to us, and Parks got on the phone to the after-hours nurses. ‘They’re about half an hour away, at another job’ he said. ‘No worries; let them know we’ll just park up around the corner and meet them there.’ He nodded, let them know, and we settled in to wait.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nWhile we chilled out in the car, I tried to appease Parks, who was looking a bit down about the prospect of a job where there was probably minimal opportunity to chase someone, jump over fences, or have a good fight. I think he might have actually been a police dog in a previous life; to this day, nothing gets him more excited than the idea of a foot pursuit.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n‘You know Arnie?’ I asked, and Parks nodded. Arnie was another guy we worked with who, like me, was in his mid-twenties, and both of us had borne the brunt of many jokes referring to our fresh faced looks and similarities in appearance to a 16 year old. I grinned, and continued. ‘The last one of these jobs I had, where we had to scoop the guy up and take him to hospital, I was working with Arnie. We walked in with the nurses, and the guy lost his shit; thought we weren’t real cops. Kept saying the nurses had brought two kids along and dressed them up in fancy dress.’ Parks lost it laughing, and I went on. ‘We ended up having to wrestle him into cuffs because he really thought we were children, kept saying ‘You’re kids! Why are there kids here?’ and trying to get away from us. We got him in the back of the police van, and you could hear him going off on the audio feed coming from the pod; ‘How are you driving? You’re only children! You haven’t even got a licence yet!’. I laughed at Parks and told him ‘So, you never know, we might get a tussle out of this one yet.’ Parks brightened up, and made a comment that I still occasionally remind him of; ‘I hope we get a story out of this one.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAs we waited, I reached across and had a closer look at the details of the job. I frowned as a little alarm bell went off inside my head. ‘Did you see this?’ I asked, and Parks gave me a puzzled look in reply. I read out the text; ‘Subject has previously allegedly made threats to harm mental health staff, and has previously barricaded himself inside to prevent assessment.’ Parks’ puzzled look changed to mirror my frown, and I asked him ‘Can you run our guy up?’. He reached for the keyboard, punched some details into the system and brought up the profile. As he clicked on the single ‘alert’ tab, another alarm bell went ringing, this one a bit louder than the first. ‘Has previously told police he enjoys being tasered, and also told them that he wants to be shot.’ Parks raised his eyebrows at me. ‘Sounds like a great guy.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nWe didn’t have to wait too much longer before a white sedan parked up behind us, and our nurses got out. They were both ladies, with one in her early forties, and the other in her mid-fifties. We introduced ourselves, and ask what to expect. The younger nurse grimaced. ‘Well… he’s probably not going to be too happy about it all. One of our colleagues went around earlier today, and he was extremely upset and aggressive, going through a psychotic episode. He doesn’t know that he’s been placed on forms, and doesn’t know that we’re coming.’ I sighed ‘So, chances are he’s not going to come quietly?’. She shook her head in response ‘I doubt it. He lives with his mother, and she knows we’re coming but she’s probably going to be upset too, so it’s not going to be easy.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI had a quick think. ‘Ok, plan is, you knock on the door, and as soon as there’s any indication that, no, he’s not going to happily come with us, we’ll grab him and handcuff him. Less chance that anyone gets hurt, no time for him to go off. We’re pretty busy tonight, but I’ll see if I can get another car to come along. 4 sets of hands instead of 2, just in case.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nNeither of the nurses were built for a wrestle and I didn’t expect them to get hands on anyway. I’m not overly large myself, and while Parks is a pretty big guy, he was still quite new to it all, and I figured it’d be better to try grab some back up, just in case things went to hell.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI jumped on the radio and put a call out for a crew to give us a quick hand. As expected, I got silence… silence… and more silence. Just as the dispatcher was apologising, a local inquiry team car jumped on and said they’d help us out. It wasn’t long before Lucy and John arrived and we had a quick briefing, before jumping in our respective cars and driving around the corner.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nOur attend address was one of a few units, and wasn’t visible from the road. As we started walking up the long driveway to the back of the block, I started to get an odd feeling. By now, it was around 9:30pm, pitch black outside, and we were in the middle of the suburbs. But the music that was coming out of the unit… I’ll never forget it. I’ve got a pretty broad taste in music, but I’d never heard anything like it… kind of like this electro-house with a constant pounding beat, but some sort of feral screaming wail over the top. Parks later described it as ‘music you would kill kittens to.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nWe walked closer and closer to the unit, and as we got to the front door, the music was absolutely blasting from inside. I could also make out the sound of water gushing too, as if someone had left a tap on running full-bore. The front door was closed and so were the window blinds, but I could make out a faint flickering glow from inside, not from lights, but like a television had been left on. Everything about it just screamed… wrong. The lights, the sound… this guy was supposed to be living here in a nice little suburban unit with his mum?  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI stood next the front door with the nurses. There was a window next to the door, then the corner of the house, another window, and a bit further along there was a glass sliding door that led to a fenced off patio area. I could just make out closed blinds blocking our view through the sliding door. A small gate led from the patio to the end of the drive where the others were standing.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI nodded to one of the nurses, who looked more than slightly nervous. She walked up to the front door, raised her fist, and knocked loudly on the security screen… and… nothing. The music continued to blast, but I couldn’t hear any movement from inside. She gave it about 20 seconds, then rapped loudly on the window.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThat’s when we heard it – a muffled ‘Hmmmph!’ from inside, barely audible over the pounding music. It started repeating, and I turned and looked at the others. We all seemed to speak at the same time. ‘Is that-‘ ‘-Help?’ ‘Fuck, is that the mother?’ ‘Fuck!’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAs I moved around the corner to the next window, Parks ran to the patio fence and started to pull himself over it… and dropped back down as John opened the gate next to him. They moved to the sliding door and I called out ‘Can you get in?’, only to hear ‘No’ back as the response.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI used my radio to make a quick call to dispatch; ‘[Call sign] urgent – we’ve got a woman screaming for help inside, I’m forcing entry.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nLucy ripped the flyscreen away from the window and I stepped forward, pulling out a small spring loaded glass breaker from my key ring. I pushed it against the glass where it did absolutely sweet fuck all, aside from making a bit of a hollow 'thunk'. *Well, shit.*  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI drew my baton from my belt, flicked it open, swung it as hard as I could and smashed the glass to smithereens. Without the window in the way, the volume of the music seemed to double and I could clearly make out the muffled screams now. I yelled ‘Police’ as I used my baton to try and clear away the jagged glass still stuck in the frame. I know I was only there for a few seconds, but I felt time start to stretch away into forever as I knocked the shards away… and more shards away… and thought *‘Fuck it, going to get cut, doesn’t matter, need to get in.’*  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI closed my baton at my feet, sheathed it, and reached through the window, jerking the blinds aside, only a faint glow of light coming from inside, so I pulled out my torch, flicked it on, reached up to pull myself through the chest-high window, nope need two hands, reach back, hand torch to Lucy, turn back, grab frame, feel glass slice deep into right finger, doesn’t matter, just get through, music is pounding, haul self up, woman is screaming, darkness ahead, look right, see wall, move leg through and look left, front door is barricaded with couch, fuck, step down onto glass covered coffee table, feel glass crunch under boots, step down onto floor, move past wall and look right.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAnd there he was. Standing there, deathly still, about 5 metres away from me. Staring at me. Wearing sunglasses, and absolutely surrounded by lit candles, like something out of a satanic ritual.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAs I stood on the glass covered floor, feeling the blood flowing down my hand and my stomach dropping away, I took in the scene – not moving, nothing in his hands, nothing that could be a weapon on the table near him – and looked beyond him, to see his mother sitting on a chair a few metres beyond. Tied, head to toe in electrical cords, cables, and packing tape, to the point that it was hard to make out her body. God knows how she was getting those screams out, because I couldn’t see her face or head at all; it was completely bound in tape and aluminium foil. It was like something out a completely fucked up horror film; like Satan incarnate, standing there with his victim.   \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nIt’s funny, the things that flash through your head in a split second. You don’t really ‘think’ about things, because you don’t have time to mull things over, but you just ‘know’ them. I knew I didn’t want to go hands on, because one) my hand was pissing out with blood, two) glass everywhere and when we most likely went to the ground, we’d both get sliced up, three) if we went backwards, we’d probably end up taking mum out and she’d go head first into the ground, and four) candles. Candles fucking everywhere. Fire bad.   \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAs I drew my taser and flicked it on, I got my first indication that Lucy had made it through the window behind me, as I saw her taser’s red dot appear on target. As I started with my commands; ‘Police, get on the ground! You’re under arrest, get down on the ground now!’, Lucy called out to try and stop the mother’s continued screams; ‘It’s the police, it’s ok, we’ll help you in a minute.’ The screams stopped, and it was just me, fighting to be heard over the music as he continued to stand there and stare… still staring, and then…  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n‘Am I under arrest?’ It’s kind of funny, when I think about it. It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t aggressive. It was a calm and slightly confused voice that came out. I lowered my taser slightly; ‘Yes mate, you’re under arrest. I need you to get on the ground for me.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n‘I’m under arrest…?’ It was still questioning, but with a little more confidence this time, and a little more surety. I waved my left hand towards the ground as I lowered my taser a bit further and told him ‘That’s right, you’re under arrest. Now get down on the ground for me.’  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAs he lay down on the ground, I holstered my taser and took a step forwards. ‘Alright mate, now roll over for me. Roll onto your front, onto your stomach.’ All I got was a scrunched up face in return. ‘Roll onto your stomach for me.’ Nothing.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n*Fuck.* With the position of the wall and the kitchen bench, there was no way for me to step around him. I took a quick step over his arm to get passed – quietly thinking ‘Fuck me, if you grab my leg I’m going to lose my fucking shit’ – and reached down, taking his arm with an ‘Alright mate, I’m just going to roll you over’, other hand on shoulder, shift , roll, ‘Bring your hands behind you back, there we go’, cuff-cuff, and up past him to his mum.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nTaking a hold of her hand felt like grabbing onto an ice block. She was absolutely frozen, and I could see that her hands and arms were swollen up around the cords and cables cutting into her. I pulled a little safety cutter from my key ring and started cutting one side as Lucy stepped in with a pair of scissors and started on the other. As I tried to be as gentle as I could, cutting the tight tape and foil from her face so she could breathe, I could see the tears flowing from underneath and into my hand.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI used one hand to radio for an ambulance as I kept cutting with the other. By this time, Parks and John had made it inside after us. John started taking photos of the scene as it was while Parks moved aside the couch that had been barricading the front door, and turned off the god-awful music and taps; every single tap in the house had been on, gushing water.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nTurns out every single lightbulb in the house had been taken out, but from the light of the candles, I could see that she had massive bruises on her face, and her nose appeared to be badly broken. She groaned and cried softly as we worked to free her, and as she lifted her head up, I saw yet another cord, this one cutting into deep into her throat and basically leaving a ligature mark. After a minute or two of frantic cutting and slicing, we finally got her free.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nShe’d been like that for about 6 hours. Tied up, not being able to move, not being able to see, and not knowing where he was. Just sitting there with the candles, the music, and the taps. We found out she’d tried to escape at one stage and he’d used a kitchen drawer to beat her, breaking her nose and leaving her covered in bruises. Apparently he tried to burn the house down with her in it a few years ago, so she was stuck there, for 6 hours, thinking that he was going to burn her alive while she was tied to the chair.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThe scary thing is that, with these particular jobs, if there’s no real risk identified and it gets too late at night, it’s not uncommon for them to be held over until day shift. She was in a pretty bad shape when we got to her, and if it had of been held over, she definitely would have been dead by the next morning.   \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThe ambulance came a short time later and took her off to hospital. After speaking to the detectives and handing over to them, Parks and I took our guy where he was supposed to go at the beginning; a locked ward at a psychiatric hospital, where he still is.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThis happened about a month and a half ago. I’m writing about it, because I’m sick of thinking about it. I’ve gone over it a thousand times, and there’s nothing I would change. But it still sticks with me. Every time I see someone put sunglasses on, I get a trigger. Whenever I see brown packing tape, I get a flash back and my stomach grabs. I know I’ll never forget it completely, and that’s ok. But a little less would be good. \n",

        "text": "I was sexually abused by my father when I was kid (sad, I know, but that's not what this is about). The detective assigned to the case has been great. He's really sweet and very funny. So I wanted to share some stories.\n\nI finally got up the courage to report my dad to the police last July. I went to the police station. I talked to a police officer. He asked me some questions and then asked me to write a victim statement. I did. When I left I realized that I accidentally stole the pen he gave me. I felt really bad about this. I realize it's just a pen, but it felt wrong stealing from a police station.\n\nLater that week, Detective Smith called me and asked me to come down to the police station. I drove down there. He interviewed me about the sexual assaults. It was rather awkward, but we made it through it. He was almost intimidatingly professional. As he was walking me out, I said \"Oh, I accidentally stole this pen the last time I was here.\" He took the pen from me, got the attention of everyone in police station, held the pen up and declared \"Hey guys, we solved another one.\" I think I turned bright red.\n\nIn September, Detective Smith and I met with a prosecutor. We just went over the charges and what to expect in the up coming months. Honestly, this was stuff I already knew. The prosecutor said she didn't really need to ask me about the sexual assaults because I gave a really a really good statement. I said \"Thank you. I just tried to get through the elements.\" Detective Smith starts to chuckle. I ask, \"what's so funny?\" He replied, \"I've never heard of victim say that before. You're the most professional victim I've ever had.\"\n\nToday is my birthday, and Detective Smith called me. We talked to a minute and wished me a happy birthday. We always get on these weird tangents. We'll end up talking about why Superman is my favorite super hero or funny stories from when he was in police academy. This time we somehow got on to the topic of 80's cop shows. \nDetective Smith says, \"You probably don't even remember the 80's.\" \nI replied \"I wasn't even alive in the 80's. \nI was born in 1990.\" \nHe says \"Wow, that makes me feel so old.\" \nI say \"Really? You were what, like, 12 at the end of the 80's.\" \n\"Let's just say I graduate from high school in the 80's.\" \n\"Oh, I didn't know you were so...\" \"\nOld? Were you going to say old?\"\n\"Experienced. That's what I was going to say.\" \n\"Oh, I see. Good save.\"\n\nThe trial date has been set for mid February. It's been an emotionally exhausting process, so I'm glad it will be over soon. But I'm sad I won't get to talk to the detective anymore.",

        "text": "It strange how all large house parties end up the same. A festering collaboration of disintegrating youth and delinquency. They all hold that same stench. A collection of alcohol, sex, marijuana, and vomit fills the air above and ferments, waiting for you to approach and began its assault on your senses. Parties are loud. They can be heard from a great distance. Thumping music. Cheering crowds. Screams and laughter emit from a single location. A calling to the masses around. A call to criminal mischief and regrets bringing all types of crowds to increase the size of this diseased group. More alcohol. More drugs. More women. More fights. It slowly become a living organism itself. The residence becomes alive, each participant a cell, completing a self chosen job. Drink. Fuck. Fight. Repeat. Most anyone is invited, only requirements for entry are falling morals and whatever alcohol you can conjure up. Everyone invited. Except for me.\n\nStrange what a badge and gun do to your reputation at a party. Simply my presence will send a few tipsy individuals scrambling. I let them run. I'm not here for them. No. I have bigger fish to catch. The brass want someone to question. Someone to inform them of this rebellious movement gaining strength within our city. Within my city. I leave the light bar off. No need to alert them before I get what I came for. The glory of a noise complaint is it's anonymity. Although this neighborhood is ruled by the rebels, preventing any noise complaints from neighbors, anyone can file a complaint.\n\n\"I don't like this song. A little too loud for my taste\" I remark to my partner.\n\nShe nods with a smirk.\"Let's check it out\" she chirps out.\n\n\n\"Baker 21 - Show us on scene for a noise complaint - requesting additional units\" I pipe over the radio.\n\n\n\"Baker 21 - we show you on scene, stay safe\" dispatch replies.\n\nI reach for the plastic handle to my door. It's worn smooth over the years of opening and closing. The oils and coarse surface of my hands have glossed it over. I pause. And take a breath. \"One... Two...\" Smash! Before my door opens a beer bottle, half empty, shatters over the window of my door sending alcohol and brown glass in a magnificent explosion through the air and across my cruiser. A few seconds later and that would have been my head. I throw my door open and lock eyes with the kid that threw it. His body still bent forward from the release of his beverage. Cheers emit from the crowd as he regains his balance and straightens his posture. He pumps his chest out at me. That's our man. His tattoos show his affiliation to the group we're after and he just committed assault on a peacekeeping officer.\n\n\"You’re done you little shit\" I murmur as I slam my door closed and begin my advance towards him. One hand on my holster and the other holding my mag light. I send the beam of light directly into his face, keep him distracted while I go to snatch him up. But the crowd seems to have a different plan. Booing echoes around me. Swearing intensifies as we get closer. \"Fucking pigs\" seems to be popular phrase with this group. A shame they lack respect for what we do. I'm going to take pride in ending their little party. I reach forward and snatch the punk who threw the bottle then drag him back towards my cruiser. I need to get him away from this crowd, away from the chaos in order to make my arrest. Unfortunately the mass in front of me disagrees with the apprehension of their own. Like white blood cells fighting against a foreign body the begin to advance.  \n\n\"STAY BACK\" I yell out.\n\n\n\"STAY BACK\" my partner joins in. Her voice doesn't carry the power mine does, but I'd rather her backing me up then her being a silent witness to this hostile mob.\n\n\n\"STAY BACK, STAY THE FUCK BACK!\" I yell into the crowd.\n\n\n\"Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!\" The begin to chant back. More bottles began raining down on us. Shattering behind us. Shattering at our feet. This situation is turning bad quickly. I increase the pace of our retreat and yell over the crowd to my partner,\n\n\"GET BACK TO THE CRUISER AND GET THE SHOTGUN\".\n\nI hear her reply but the words are drowned by the mass in front of us. My back hits the door of my cruiser but the distance between myself and the crowd hasn't changed. I see a flicker In the night sky above. A bottle has found its path leading towards my head. I release the suspect to shield my face from the alcoholic projectile. The bottle bounds off of my hand and lands at my feet. Although that move saved myself from glass wounds, the little shit I was trying to arrest took the chance to run.\n\n\n\"STAY AT THE FUCKING CAR\" I yell to my partner as I begin my foot chase after him.\n\nHe isn't fast, alcohol has taken effect on his body and he stumbles every few steps in his attempt to escape me, giving me opportunities to catch up. I'm not letting him get away. His path seems jumbled and confused. He clearly doesn't have a planned escape route and the thick scent of liquor leaves a breadcrumb trail for me to follow. We enter an alley way and the distance between us slowly decreases. He rounds a corner and I lose sight of him. I begin to turn with him, but I wasn't quick enough.\n\nI hear a loud crack as I'm met with the barrel of a gun. The lead bullet it spit out enters my cheek. It tumbles and tears it's way through my jaw, smashing bone and teeth, burning the skin inside as the concussion wave destroys everything in its path. The molten lead exits  through my neck, taking skin and life along with it. My ears ring and my eyes cease to see anything around me. The pain and blood blinding me. The excess gunpowder scalding the remnants of my face. I reach up towards the gun and attempt to push his arm away from me. Another crack and a bullet enters my stomach. Muscle and skin are shredded as it finds a home near my spine. I continue my struggle with my attacker, survival is on the line and adrenaline begins pumping through me. A third crack and his bullet tears through my leg, dropping me down to one knee. Perfect height for an execution. I jam my fingers into the cylinder, preventing the live round from being struck by the hammer. Preventing the round from exiting his revolver and ending my life. My trembling hand fumbles the holster on my belt as I feel strength leaving my body. The clasp pops free and I wrap my fingers around my pistol. Smith and Wesson have come to save me as I shove the barrel of my weapon to what I can make out to be his lower chin, and pull back the trigger. A single bullet rips the life from my attacker. His body becomes limp and his corpse hits the ground with a solid thump. My vision is blurred but I can make out shapes. I'm quickly dying but I'm sure as hell not going to die next to this fucker. I grab his weapon as I holster mine and begin my journey back to my car. I can't speak, my jaw hangs loose and any calls over the radio would do me no good. I attempt to stand but the third bullet doesn't agree with me and I collapse to the ground. Not here. I can't die here. I shift my weight to my good leg and prop myself up on my hands. I slowly shuffle my body forward in a painful crawl. My muscles strain as my energy decreases with each forced lurch forward. I can see red and blue lights. A Crown Vic coming to my rescue. Fellow brothers and sisters in blue coming to keep me alive. No. It's not moving. It's my cruiser.\n\nOfficer Adams must have spotted me. Through the ringing in my ears I can hear her yelling to me. I see boots come up to me and hands wrap under my shoulders. She's got me, dragging my corpse back to the car. I can feel the strain in her arms. I sorry I wasn't lighter Becky. She props me up against my door. The smell of alcohol still drips from it. I'm losing the battle between life and death. My soul is slowly slipping, my breathing is becoming hindered by the amount of blood leaking from my neck. I search for something to grasp onto. Something to keep me here. I find Adams' face. I wish I hadn't. I see nothing but panic in her eyes as she's attempting to decide which leak to stop. The right choice could save my life. The wrong choice could end it. But is there really a choice? I can feel the warmth of my blood over my skin, perhaps I'm too far gone. Her look of desperation confirms my last assumption.\n\nI'm twenty six and already dead. I have no legacy behind me. I have no children to carry my name on. I have no wife to mourn my death. No family to bury me. Just myself and the Officer who spent the last year in the same car as I. Five days a week we've shared the cruiser my dying body is propped up against. A home away from the decaying apartment I sleep in. That is if I sleep. Five years serving this city and I’ve already seen enough shit to haunt me for centuries to come. Unfortunately I won’t get to enjoy those many years of drunken regret and and loneliness. Death has a grip on me and the fucker won’t let me go.\n\nAdams holds onto my bloodied hand. Dirt from my retreat cakes my hand as that kid’s blood mixes with mine. My grip loosens as hers tightens. Shes saying something to me. I can’t hear her. It’s most likely the typical shit you tell someone who is already dead.\n\n“Its going to be alright”, “You’re going to make it”, “It isn't that bad”, “Don’t you leave me”.\n\nA shame It won’t be alright. A shame I won’t make it. A shame it really is that bad. A shame I’m going to leave you. A shame...",

Dick owns a house which is at the end of a street which is the minor street in a T intersection. The major street is a clearway so naturally everyone from there parks in his street. He has a garage full of his tools and a carport where he \"can't park because he'll get paint on his car's $10000 paint job\" because the house is currently being renovated. He calls us because there's someone parking in his spot. Dick actually believed that he should have the right to park on the street outside his house and no one else should be able to. After about half an hour of Dick being a dick the lady who owns the car comes out, she's a deaf lady who cares for the disabled lady next door. She's not complaining about having to walk 20 metres and Dick says to her face in front of us that he's going to smash her car with a sledge hammer if she does it again.\n\nLong story short, I promise if Dick calls us again I'm going to earn a complaint or arrest him for public nuisance.",

        "text": "I leaned my head back against the cold concrete block wall and closed my eyes. It wasn’t the first time I’d been in the situation, but waiting on your boss to give the briefing of his IA case to your commanding officer seemed to be about the most uncomfortable spot I could imagine. \n\nRationally, I knew I shouldn’t be worried: my lieutenant had told me the case “was open and shut” and that he knew the guy filing it was just looking to get some comeuppance for me making a good case against him. He interviewed me the same day the complaint came in and conducted a phone interview with the guy shortly thereafter. \n\n“It’s just a documentation thing at this point.” He assured me. \n\nTrue to form with any large government entity, the “documentation” took several weeks to get pushed through to the point of resolution. Between putting off typing his investigation and finding a time to meet with the commander, my lieutenant had given me enough time to totally forget about the matter entirely. It came as a slap to the face that morning when the message on my in car computer told me to head in and knock out the “IA thing.” I had been parked next to /u/detectivebrandon and he happily hooted and gave advice where to find a good box to clean out my locker as I pulled away. \n\nI could hear the murmuring of my two bosses on the other side of the door but couldn’t make out any words or the tone of their conversation. I hoped the long wait indicated everything would be quick and painless once I went in, like pulling a Band-Aid off in one quick motion. Maybe they were signing all the paperwork and the carbon copies that needed to be filed ahead of time, reminiscent of closing on a home. \n\nI heard the scrape of a chair and the door opened. My Lt was standing in the frame, smiling and nodded me in wordlessly. The commander was chatting on his desk phone.\n\n“Yeah hon, ok. I’ll be sure to do that. Look, I gotta go, I’ve got an officer in my office. Love you too. Bye.” He hung up and nodded to me to take a seat. The commander was new to our station and I wasn’t sure where I stood with him. \n\n“Been getting in a little trouble with the locals, eh EMR?” He started, his face not betraying what I hoped was dry humor. \n\n“Well, you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet.”  I was so nervous I wasn’t even sure the phrase applied but was happy at least my voice didn’t quake when I put it out there. \n\n“I was just telling the commander how good you’re doing out there. You’re the guy the rest of the squad looks up too and you don’t need to worry about little stuff like this.” Lt told me in a calm voice. I could feel my face redden with embarrassment. \n\n“I’ve heard of your cases prior to getting here. You have any plans to move on to narcotics? Investigations maybe?” The commander had done time in both sections during his non-supervisory years and had made a name for himself there. His recommendation for me to follow in his path was an honor. \n\n“Well, yeah. I think. I’d like to go to robbery one day maybe. Not so sure about narcotics.” I laughed to try and cover up my continued nervousness, hoping to transition to the meat and potatoes of why I was in the office that afternoon. \n\n“So, this case… Lieutenant Smith gave it a full write up with recommendation. I don’t see any reason to rock the boat. There’s some paperwork you’ll have to sign but an oral reprimand should be more than sufficient to cover things.” The commander pushed a file across the desk in my direction, obviously wanting me to take it for review. \n\nI shot a glance at the Lt who had suddenly found something very interesting on his fingernails. I felt relieved but at the same time angry – an oral reprimand seemed to indicate I had done something wrong. I wasn’t sure what my next move should be but my hesitation must have spoken for me.\n\n“Everything ok?” The commander asked.\n\n“Oh, yeah. Oral reprimand. Was… was there something I did wrong?” \n\n“Well, not really, no. I mean, I suppose you could have been a little more courteous when you affected the arrest.” I thought about the inherent inability to be ‘courteous’ in the middle of wrestling a coked-out shoplifter who had just brandished a knife at the loss prevention officers at the Best Buy where this complaint originated but couldn’t compute how I could have possibly been more courteous. The commander pursed his lips and steepled his fingers. \n\n“What I noted in the case file, EMR, is that you admitted you cursed at the suspect during the arrest.” The Lt nudged the case file towards me a little more but still I didn’t pick it up.\n\n“Oh. I thought he complained that I arrested him because I was racist and he’s black.” I could feel the heat returning to my face again, but this time it wasn’t for want of modesty.\n\n“Well, yes, technically that was his complaint. But during the investigation I observed other issues that I felt needed to be… documented.” The Lt looked from me to the commander who only frowned slightly and nodded in approval. \n\nThere was an awkward silence that lingered until broken by the overhead speakers, piping in the radio from the street.\n\n“5-Bravo-30, 6-Alpha-10, 5-Alpha-50, start for an unknown complaint in area 5. Caller states he hears screaming coming from his neighbor’s apartment, he is too fearful to check on her. States further she has two small children she cares for. Thirteen forty hours.” \n\nI stood up reflexively, the call having been dispatched in my area. A split second later I realized where I was and looked back to the commander who was now smiling.\n\n“Are you working area 5 today? That was my old beat. Go on, head to the call. I assume you won’t dispute the finding? I can leave your copies and another to sign in your mailbox.” He leaned back in his chair and rested his head back on his interwoven fingers, elbows jutting out like horns to either side. \n\nI just nodded and muttered an unenthusiastic, “Ok,” as I hurried out of the office. I jogged to my car and dropped it into gear as soon as it turned over. A moment later I was weaving my way through traffic in the most controlled manner I could. Between the potential for disaster at the call I was heading to and the utter bewilderment at being held accountable for a claim I hadn’t even been accused of, my head was swimming in adrenaline. My computer indicated one of the other units had just marked on scene. I was still a good ten minutes out thanks to the terrible traffic. \n\nAs I slowed for a red light, the radio erupted. “5-Bravo-50 foot pursuit!” Traffic had already slowed for the light and the intersection was vacant. I hit my lights and siren and eased my way under the red light before gunning the engine up the hill and through the rapidly congealing traffic. \n\n“5-Bravo-50. Hispanic male… five six… white shirt with blood stains… Timberland boots… heading north on Elm!” Other officers were stepping on each other following the update and the radio traffic for a moment sounded like some alien transmission picked up by SETI.\n\nI slowed for another light and made a sharp turn, my tires squealing in protest before slamming my foo back on the gas, urging my aging Crown Vic though the industrial area just prior to the barrio. More units were marking on scene via the radio and I could see another unit running code a block up from me whenever we hit breaks in the buildings together.\n\nFinally I arrived at the original scene. My adrenaline filled brain urged me to try and catch up with the foot pursuit for hopes of collaring the fleeing… I wasn’t sure what he was at that point. That triggered the stronger reaction to do what was correct: I needed to check the building where the original complaint came from. \n\nAs I exited my car, Nick pulled up behind me. He hopped out and darted his gaze around. “Where’d they go? What’ve we got?”\n\n“Don’t know. I’m going to check the building.” Sirens were playing their Doplar Effect games off the walls around us but Nick nodded, if not a little apprehensively, and locked his cruiser before joining me to approach the building. I pointed to some fresh blood drops coming out of the building and staining the already dirty sidewalk. I cautiously shoved open the door to the foyer and tilted my ear to see if I could pick up any unusual sounds before entering. There was more blood there, coming from the stairwell. A strange mix of sensory overload hit me – the smell of burning ethnic food of some sort combined with strong urine odor; quiet Mexican polka and chattering Spanish following a soccer ball emanating from different doors; fresh gang graffiti on the same wall as a thumbtacked flyer for a local Jehova’s Witness group. \n\nTwo flights up and still following the blood took us to an open door. “Policia!” I yelled in. Nick and I both drew our side arms at the same time. “Police! Anyone inside make yourselves known!” I tried again.\n\nA low groan answered and it as the signal we had been waiting on. Nick and I both hurried into the apartment and took in the view: An elderly Hispanic woman was curled on the floor, a pool of blood growing around her shivering body. On the couch lay a young girl, probably five or six, her eyes closed and her skin a paler shade than healthy. A three or four year old boy whimpered from underneath a wooden table.\n\n“Come here, ven aqui.” I tried to say with calm as I knelt down. He shook his head and shut his eyes, summoning a wave of sobs.\n\n“Nick, the girl.” I stood and rushed to the girl first. I felt for a pulse and found one on my first try. Nick went to scoop her up and I stopped him. \n\n“What the hell happened?” He asked the room. \n\n“5-Alpha-50, start rescue to the original location, apartment 305. We have two, maybe three patients. One elderly female, one young female, one young male. Unknown injuries but we’re working on it.” I tried to remain calm on the mic but wasn’t sure if I accomplished my goal. \n\nNick was attending to the woman. “Are you hurt? EMR, no English.” He had a concerned look as he stood and put on his latex gloves. \n\nI hurried over and put my hand on her trembling shoulder. “A donde duele? Tienes herida?” \n\nShe replied only with a tightening of her stomach and another moan. “Where the hell is rescue, they’re right across the street?!??!” Nick was looking out the front window hoping for some sign of assistance. \n\n“Try and figure out where she’s bleeding from, I’m going to the girl again.” I rushed back to the couch and found her pulse once more. I took a moment to put on my gloves before trying to check her without moving her too much. I slid my hand behind her back and when I pulled it out, noticed my once blue glove was now covered in red. “She’s got a wound on her back!” I yelled to Nick, not sure what he could do to help.\n\n“5-Alpha-50!” I yelled into my radio. A long tone answered and I inhaled with annoyance. The other officers were chirping away their location having just apprehended the man in the foot pursuit. One of them requested rescue for him as well, saying he had lacerations to his mid-section.\n\n“5-Alpha-50,” I started, much more annoyance in my voice than I intended, “One patient, six year old female, with wounds to her back –“\n\n“This lady is bleeding from her gut.” Nick yelled.\n\n“And one sixty year old female with a bleeding wound in her stomach.” I concluded.\n\n“I- Nick! I don’t want to move this girl but I need to stop the bleeding!” I didn’t know how to help, just that I needed to do something.\n\n“4-Alpha-30, we need more units and rescue needs to pick it up!” Where I was concerned about sounding frightened or annoyed, Nick sounded authoritative. I could now here the EMS sirens approaching.\n\n“4-Alpha-30, rescue is en route. Will stage when they arrive until the scene is secure.”\n\n“Scene is clear, send them up now!” Nick spat.\n\nI looked to the boy again, still bawling under the table while clutching one of its legs. I duck walked to him, hoping I appeared non-threatening.\n\n“C’mon. I’ll help you.” I smiled to him and opened my arms. The boy opened his eyes at my voice and lowered the timbre of his cries. I beckoned him towards me with bloody gloves. Reluctantly, he peeled away first on arm, then another, then with an almost superhuman effort, speed-crawled to me and jumped onto my chest. He buried his face in the side that my radio wasn’t clipped to and I could feel his tears and snot seeping through my uniform, warm on my shoulder. I tried to peer at his back, hoping to not find any bloody patches but half expecting to. His leg was dripping blood from a deep gash in his calf. \n\nI stood as the first of the rescue squad entered, the boy clinging to me like some scrawny marsupial. “Leg wound!” I yelled to him, “The girl first. She’s bleeding from her back but I didn’t want to move her.” The first few rescue guys hurried to her, the next few to relieve Nick by the woman. A battalion chief came stalking in, obvious by his cleaner uniform and bright yellow helmet if not by his take-control stare. \n\n“I still need someone for this guy.” I called to him while I tried my best to comfort the still crying child by patting his back. I left progressively fainter finger paintings of gore on his white Cars shirt but he seemed to appreciate the effort. \n\nFinally a female EMT came rushing over and peeled the boy off. A trail of snot and tears streamed from his face and he reached for me, the vigor in his wails renewed. I turned to look for something else to do but quickly realized I was now out of my element. I joined Nick against a wall as we watched rescue strip the clothing off the two remaining patients in an effort to locate their wounds. \n\nThe girl had a small, maybe inch long, gash in her back that was seeping bright red blood. The woman had multiple like wounds in her belly and screamed in agony as they forced her to uncurl. It was a blur of blood and sounds until I had a tap on my shoulder. \n\nMy Lt curled a finger at me, motioning me to exit. “Devon’s here. You’ll need to go change and talk to homicide at the station.” I looked down at my shirt and the various patches of blood and snot and tears. I felt the breath leave me the urge to emote somehow but stifled it with a quiet, “Ok,” as I walked past him and out to my car. A flurry of activity and fire department vehicles blanketed the street but somehow, my cruiser still had a miraculous path to freedom. I took my time getting back and changing my shirt, mulling over the event and if there was something else I could have done. \n\nI eventually learned from the investigators the woman and the two children, a brother and sister, were about to leave for a trip to the bodega. When they opened the door, they startled a man who had been on a 24 hour crack and PCP binge and was in the middle of sparking his pipe in the hallway. He became enraged and pulled a knife as he rushed the woman, stabbing her repeatedly before turning on the fleeing children. He caught the girl in the back once and moved onto the boy, only able to get a swipe at his calf before he darted under the table. The girl began screaming and trying to get away from him when the old woman tried to stand and fight him off. She was stabbed again and collapsed. The man somehow cut his own hand in the attack and for some reason retreated further up the stairway into the building. When he saw the cruiser pull up, he tried to make a run for it. The bloody knife was in his pocket and the man was too far into delirium to give any information about what had occurred. \n\nThe woman succumbed to her wounds. The two children survived. I saw them about a year later while working a school crossing. The boy didn’t recognize me and where at first I was hurt by it, I was later happy that that day didn’t still dominate his life too. \n",

        "text": "**Tales from the Academy 2**\n\nThis is a sequel to the post “Tales from the Academy” in which I shared multiple short stories of my experiences in the Academy up to that point. \n\nIn this edition the stories will be just some of the scenarios I was a part of. If enough people enjoy them and ask for more, I will make a part 3. The stories will be told as if they were real-life incidents, just to make them easier to tell. I will type END SCENARIO when the scenario was completed, even if in real life there would be a lot more afterwards.\n\nFeel free to ask questions, make observations, etc. about any of the scenarios.\n\nWe just completed our final day yesterday. Now all we have left is to finish SFST/DWI Investigation, Report Writing, and STARS/Accident Investigation, all in all approximately 20 class days left.\n\nFor those who don’t know or did not read my last post, during scenario day there are 3 stations: Traffic Stops, Building Searches, and Calls for Service. Recruits go to each station in pairs, with a pair of recruits on standby in case the first team calls for assistance. Each recruit has the following (usually): Training Gun that fires rubber bb-like bullets, Training Handcuffs, Baton, Training Pepper Spray, and a Radio.\n\nThe scenarios are populated by role-players. These role players are either former recruits who have graduated from a previous class but have not yet been hired on to a police department yet, current recruits in a different class, or police officers/sheriff’s deputies from nearby agencies. \n\nThe scenarios are all contained to one building/property. One side is used for building searches, one side is used for calls for service, and outside is traffic stops and another calls for service station. \n\n**First Call**\n\nThe very first call for service that my partner and I responded to was a disturbance at a local school’s basketball court on a Saturday. The caller stated that there was a man and a woman arguing. \n\nUpon arrival to the scene, my partner and I discovered a group of about 8 people, all huddled together. I noticed that they seemed to be fighting over something. Then I caught a brief glimpse of the object passing between the legs of the group. \n\n“Gun!” I yelled to my partner and I immediately drew my own and proceeded towards the group and towards the nearby basketball goal. \n\n“Everybody get back!” I yelled as a female subject won the fight for the gun and placed it to her head. After a few seconds of me yelling “Drop the Gun” and her yelling back, I realized she was a suicidal subject and began to deescalate the tone of my voice in an attempt to communicate with her. My partner divided his attention between \ncovering the female subject and making sure the crowd stayed back. \n\nThe female subject seemed to calm down and was openly talking to me about her problems. Suddenly, she aimed the gun at my partner, forcing me to engage her. I fired 3 shots, all hitting her center mass. She did not get one shot off. \n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n**Shots Fired**\n\nMy partner and I were called to a local convenience store in response to a silent alarm. My partner being the lead on this call, he entered the store first with me right behind. \n\nAs we walked through the door, a male subject could be heard saying “Give me the money right now, b*tch.” My partner and I drew our firearms and then got a visual on the subject. He was a black male holding a revolver in his hand. The revolver was pointed at the cashier. \n\nOnce he saw us enter, he opened fire. We returned fire since all the innocents were located to the left side of the store. He fled out of an open door. My partner and I moved to cover the door, in case he returned. \n\nWith my partner covering the door, I began to take care of the people in the room, about 4 in total. Just then the subject rushed back in through the door he had left, firearm in hand. My partner attempted to engage with his firearm but had a gun malfunction. He pushed the subject’s gun away from him just as I engaged the subject with mine, striking the subject square in the chest. \n\nEND SCENARIO \n\n**Domestic Disturbance**\n\nMy partner and I were called to an apartment complex in regards to a male and female arguing loudly in an apartment. No apartment number was given. \n\nMy partner and I arrive on scene, with me taking the lead. We got about 5 steps into the building, listening for any noise, when a female comes running from around a corner about 50 feet away yelling “He has a gun” followed shortly by a gunshot going off. The female was hit and fell to the ground. The gunman retreated back around the corner. \n\nMy partner and I drew. I grabbed the female’s wrist and drug her out of the building while my partner called for assistance and EMS. We were told assistance would be about 20 minutes out just as another shot went off. \nWe moved into the building and to the corner. I sliced the pie around the corner to discover a dark, empty hallway with several doors on each side, the nearest door with a light visible from underneath and the farthest door open. We cleared the nearest room since it had gone quiet again. \n\nAs we were exiting the room, two shots rang out from the room at the end of the hall. Moving directly towards the threat, we stacked up on the door. I sliced the pie on the door, discovering a barricade that funneled all door traffic to the right. \n\nUpon reaching the opposite side of the doorway, I noticed the subject’s foot at the very corner of the room. I told my partner to contact a supervisor and request SERT. I began talking with the subject. At first all I got were “F U’s” but eventually I got the subject’s name and reason for shooting the female. 2 more shots rang out as the subject fired into the ceiling. I finally got the subject to slide the gun across the floor. \n\nMy partner and I made entry. The subject remained in the corner with his hands up. My partner held him at gunpoint while I cleared behind the barricade. Once cleared, my partner had the subject go prone and I moved in to make the arrest. The subject tried to stand up again but I quickly gained compliance and had him secured in handcuff. \n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n**Call for Assistance**\n\nOn this call, my partner and I were called to assist officers that had responded to a disturbance at a local bar. In our rush to get to the call, I was unable to get a baton or radio. \n\nOnce we entered the room, we saw about 8 people, 3 males and 5 females. One officer, Juggernaut, was on the floor arresting a very large subject. The other was doing his best to keep the other 7 people back. We assisted him and between the 3 of us, were able to get some compliance from the subjects. \n\nThey remained back and just yelled verbal insults at us. Juggernaut started having trouble with the large subject so his partner moved to assist. Then one of the males ran at the officer, in an attempt to tackle him. I was close behind. \n\nThe officer tackled the large subject, the other male subject tackled the officer, and I tackled the other male subject. As the officer was fighting the large subject, I attempted to remove the male subject from the top of him. \n\nSuddenly, the male subject began removing the officer’s gun. There was a brief struggle between the officer and him while I was still attempting to remove the male from on top of the officer. \n\nI noticed the gun to start to slide out of the holster so I drew my firearm and shot the subject twice in the side. The subject immediately let go of the gun and fell off the officer. \n\nI had just stood back up and returned to help my partner with crowd control when a large female attacked my partner and grabbed ahold of her baton. I noticed this struggle so I grabbed the female by the arms and forced her to the ground. \n\nSince she was larger than I and had almost 100 pounds on me, I was unable to completely subdue her and place her in cuffs. Juggernaut, having finished with his large male, assisted and pinned down one of her arms. \n\nI placed her in handcuffs and held her down on the ground. At this point the other officer and my partner had the crowd under control, since all the instigators were either shot or in handcuffs. \n\nEND SCENARIO\n",

        "text": "This story is one of many random anecdotes and \"war stories\" from my teachers and mentors days in Law Enforcement. I thought I'd share one about Rick's probie-hood.\n\nIn the old days, or as Rick would call it, \"The Wild West\" days of law enforcement. He was a young probie in a small department pushing a black and white with his RTO.  His RTO was a grizzled veteran of WW2 and Korea that had a no-nonsense attitude about things. But he was an honest cop of the old-old. The department gets a call for an armed robbery of a convenience store in town. As far as small towns go, the whole department showed up to talk to the alleged gunman.\n\nThis was before military type equipment was issued to police and no one had thought to bring the hardware available at the station. They were determined to make a non-violent confrontation with the suspect and bring him back peaceably. Rick and RTO pull up to the store and got briefed in the situation. One guy with a handgun, no hostages.\n\nAfter a breakdown in trying to talk the man out, the suspect decides to make his point by leaving from the backdoor, accidentally finding himself face to face with Rick's RTO. Guy decides to fire at the old man and duck behind a dumpster. Rick's RTO had become impatient, not taking too kindly of being shot at. He goes to the back of his car and pulls out this old antique of a gun. A Winchester .45-90. He proceeds to load a round and tells the suspect to give up, but the only thing he got back was a big \"FUCK YOURSELF OLD MAN!\" Rick's RTO puts a round into the dumpster.\n\nThe following silence was marked by a piss stain and a stunned suspect with his hands up from behind the dumpster. Other officers move in to take the suspect. The suspect was being put into the back of the car and says to Rick's RTO. \"I, um, didn't know you could do that.\"\n\nRick swore this to me, he went to see the other side of the dumpster. There was a fist size dent, pointed outwards to where the suspect's face would've been.",

        "text": "“This guy’s a wanna-be bad ass but should be a push over if he’s home.” Ken addressed our loose circle in the nearly abandoned parking lot we had chosen to brief our morning task. “If mom’s home, she should give him up. At least, she has in the past.”\n\nA picture of our target was passed around while most of us tried to keep our hands from freezing off. The sun had yet to rise and other than the hum of traffic already traversing the freeway a quarter-mile away, there was an almost apocalyptic quiet. My turn to take a look at the picture came and I reluctantly extracted my hands from my pockets. The whole “don’t-forget-your-gloves” lesson was always a hard one for me to learn. \n\n“When we pull up to the building, the target apartment is on the back side so we can park in front without them seeing us. It’s on the seventh floor so we don’t need to worry about rear coverage. We will need a couple to stand by the stairs in the lobby in case he does get a heads up we’re there. Closest hospital is Big City General and the address is in the email I sent you all earlier.” Ken asked if we had any questions before concluding the briefing and we all made our way to our cars. \n\nThe early morning warrant services were becoming commonplace and I wasn’t one to complain. The early mornings seemed to make the day go by faster and there was always a chance for overtime come the end of the day if things got busy. What was an issue was my cruiser: cold mornings meant a cranky starter that sometimes refused to cooperate with the plan. On the fourth attempt, my car finally started up. I sped through the parking lot to catch up with the other guys and my absence wasn’t missed. \n\n“Might want to get that thing tuned up EMR: caboose gets the bitch job!” The radio blared at me. I sighed but didn’t give a reply – I knew since I was now last in line I’d be relegated to lobby stairwell duty and most likely out of the action. “Matt’s running late too so he can join you when he gets here. Be listening for him on coms.” \n\nI parked in the back of a long line of cruisers and jogged to catch up to Ken who was holding the door for the others to enter the lobby. “Stairway’s down there, but they have to come out this way through the lobby to exit the front,” He said before motioning down a long corridor, “Or the back entrance. Matt should be here soon and we’ll be listening on radio for you if anything happens.”\n\nThe fact I wasn’t even being provided backup demonstrated the extremely low probability I’d have need to call for help but I just nodded and took my spot leaning against a wall where I could observe the stairwell exit from the lobby. I felt a little overdressed in my thigh rig and rifle-plate-equipped tactical vest but it was too late to dress down now. \n\nThe group filed into one of the small elevators across the hall from my vantage point. I noticed it seemed a little tight and heard one of the guys crack some joke about a Roman bath house before the doors slid shut. I watched the numbers creep slowly to the right, indicating the current location of the elevator and wishing I could be there to help kick in the door if it came to it. \n\nSuddenly the elevator made the “DING!” sound you hear which usually indicates it had arrived at your floor. I thought it odd and looked to the lights. All twelve floor numbers were now lit and flashing. \n\nA movement from the stairwell drew my attention, but it wasn’t the target. An elderly woman dressed in Middle-Eastern garb slowly exited and made her way from the stairs. She grimaced in pain and massaged her knees as she made her way to me. She looked up and noticed me, decked out like a foot soldier, and I nodded and said, “Good morning.”\n\n“Not that good.” She replied, shaking her head. “These bastards need to fix the damn elevator so my knees can get better. It’s a slum here!” Her accent punctuated the anger in her words nicely and she continued past, out the door and into the still dark morning.\n\nI chuckled after her, and then had a realization: the elevator. I looked at the numbers again: still flashing. “Oh crap.” I said out loud to no one in particular.\n\n“Uhhh… EMR?” My earpiece chirped. It was Ken.\n\n“Go ahead.”\n\n“Can you hit the call button on the elevator down there?” There was a tinge of angst in his voice and I quickly crossed the foyer and hit the button. It just dinged back at me. \n\n“Uhhh… Ken?”\n\n“Go ahead.”\n\n“No-go bud. It just dings at me.”\n\nThere was a long pause from the radio. Clearly there was a problem in the elevator. \n\n“EMR?” Ken’s voice now had an even keener edge of angst, now bordering panic.\n\n“Yeah?” \n\n“Could you contact fire for us? We’re… stuck.” His voice cracked during his request. It was well known that Ken and another guy in the elevator were severe claustrophobes.\n\n“On it man.” It wasn’t the action I had been hoping for but at least I had a purpose other than holding up a wall now. I switched my radio over to a main dispatch channel and gave my identifier. “Whiskey 47.”\n\nThe dispatcher answered back. “Whiskey 47, go ahead.”\n\n“Whiskey 47, can you roll fire side to my location? We have several team members trapped in an elevator.”\n\n“Whiskey 47 10-4. Did you say trapped in an elevator?” Apparently this request wasn’t made very often and the dispatcher needed confirmation on what she had just heard. \n\n“10-4. Seven PD, I believe. Trapped in an elevator.”\n\nAnother silence followed – either the dispatcher processing my request or sharing a laugh with her co-workers. Dispatchers, in my experience, revel in the poor fortune of their charges. The jovial tone of her voice when she came back across the radio confirmed my latter guess.\n\n“Whiskey 47, 10-4 on your request. Fire is en route.” She was almost laughing, I knew it.\n\nI switched my radio back to the tactical channel my stranded team was using. “Fire department in on their way guys.”\n\n“Can… can you come up to the fourth floor and see if you can pry open the doors?” Ken’s voice was full tremor mode and I could hear angry muttering in the background.\n\n“I can, but do you want someone here for fire? Matt isn’t here yet.”\n\nThe radio keyed up on the other side but there was only background noise. Then, “Yeah… you’re… you’re right. Just… send them up as soon as they get here!”\n\nI didn’t reply to the fearful order, instead I walked to the window hoping to see the fire department’s blazing red lights that would precede the liberation of my comrades. It seemed to take an eternity throughout which – several times – the radio keyed up but no one spoke.\n\nFinally a big engine pulled up. It slowed near the entrance then sped off past it. It doubled back and finally came to a stop directly in front of the doors and a couple hose draggers slowly disembarked their vessel. \n\nOne led the way into the foyer after I opened the door for them. “Who the hell is parked in the fire zone?!?” He spat as he scanned the foyer.\n\n“Uhhh… us?” I replied to his back. He wheeled on me and scanned me up and down.\n\n“Well, there’s a reason it’s a fire zone, not a police zone.” I could only nod in agreement.\n\nA couple fire fighters walked to the elevator and pushed the button. They were returned a DING! and turned to me and their obvious boss.\n\n“Can’t do anything down here. D’you know where they’re stuck?”\n\n“Oh, yeah. They said fourth floor.” I the remembered to report the status to the guys and radioed to them. “Fire side is here, making our way up to fourth floor now.”\n\n“Tell… tell them to hurry!”\n\n“They sound a little stressed.” I told the fire fighter who was obviously the elevator expert.\n\nI tailed two of them up the stairs to the fourth floor and then to the elevator doors. They pried it open and peered down. \n\n“Well,” One of them started “This is as close as we’ll get to it. We’re still too far to get to the inner doors though. Looks like we might need to extract them out the service hatch.”\n\nI stood by as the fire department worked. One of them complained to me that “this was the third call for that same elevator this week” and the management was going to have to face a daunting trial of inspections in the days to come for it.\n\nThe service hatch was opened after some time (it was about a three foot drop to the top of the stranded elevator) and looking into the small compartment was akin to watching CNN coverage of coal miners being rescued from a collapsed mineshaft.\n\n“Jesus! You guys really wedged yourselves in there!” One of the nozzle jockeys called down. \n\n“Shut up and get us out!” Ken yelled back. It was a tough ordeal considering the amount of gear each guy had, but eventually the whole, sweaty lot of them was pulled out. \n\n“Guys? Where are you? I got the target in custody.” We all looked up, realizing someone outside our group had just come across the radio. \n\n“Matt?” Ken asked over the air. \n\n“Yeah. I got the guy. We’ll be down to the lobby in a sec.”\n\nWe all gave puzzled looks to one another then heard a grinding sound come from the other elevator shaft. \n\n“Uhhh… guys?” Matt said on the radio.\n\nThe firefighters shook their heads and one looked into the already opened shaft door, up at Matt and his arrestee’s stranded car. \n\n“He’s with us too.” I told him.\n",

        "text": "So I'm driving home from a late shift, with a headlight out. I know it's out, it blew that day and I just hadn't had time to go to the store to pick up a bulb. \n\nI'm at a stoplight, there's an officer across the intersection from me, and I just know he looks really bored. Sure enough, as soon as the light turns green, he nearly floors it in his squad car, whips a U-Turn in the middle of the intersection with tires screeching in protest, then pulls me over in a gas station parking lot. I'm freaking out at this point, sure he thinks I'm some violent criminal.\n\nI made damn sure I was complying. I shut the car off, left the dome light one, put my hands on the steering wheel and waited. He approached my car with his gun drawn in left hand, but pointed down at his side, his flashlight over his right shoulder with his right hand. I'm sweating buckets. \n\n\"G-good evening officer. Can I help you?\" He shines the light in my face, destroying any night vision I had, and looks around my car for a second.\n\n\"I've noticed your headlight is out, driver side. Did you know that?\"\n\nWhy was his gun drawn for a head light? What the hell kinda backwoods cowboy cop was this?\n\n\"Uhh... well yes, I just hadn't had time to go to the store today. I work an evening shift\"\n\nThe officer chuckled, \"I'd kill for a day shift too. Let me take care of that for ya after I run your license and insurance.\"\n\nHe turned back to his squad car with a huge grin on his face after taking my ID and insurance, and I could see he hadn't drawn his weapon at all... it was a screwdriver. He came back and asked me to pop the hood, which I did, and he put a new bulb in my car right there in the gas station parking lot. I was dumbstruck. \n\nHe goes back to his car for a few minutes then comes back to my window, still grinning from ear to ear. \"Just to show my superiors I'm working and not napping, I have to write up this verbal warning. Don't worry, it's literally just a paper that shows I told you about the light, and you agreed to fix it. It won't be on your record or anything.\"\n\n\"I... erm. Well thank you very much.\" I just had no idea what to say side form profuse gratitude. This whole thing seemed like a sketch from a comedy. \n\n\"I'm Officer (name), by the way. The city is currently conducting a satisfaction survey for police service,\" he hands me a yellow business card, which I still have in my wallet to this day. \n\nIt has his name written in pen on a printed line after \"Officer ________\" and a city government website to, no fucking joke, take a survey on how well I perceived the officer to have handled my traffic stop today, with a little reference number at the bottom to enter in, should I do the survey. \n\n\"This is... a satisfaction survey?\"\n\n\"Yep. Just go to the internet page there, and enter my name and the reference number, and then answer a few questions about how you felt about the traffic stop tonight.\"\n\nNow I was really feeling like this was all part of a gag, I'm on some prank show and this cop is about to point to a camera and people from the gas station would come out and have a laugh at the prank.\n\n\"You're serious? A survey?\"\n\n\"Yessir. Have a good evening!\" He jumped back in his car and waved at me with the brightest smile a man can give as he drove back onto the road. \n\nThe survey was real, and it was the least I could do to give this officer 10/10 on all questions about his service. He did replace my light for free, after all. \n\nWeirdest thing I've ever experienced with police.",

        "text": "It dawns on me (in the course of writing this story) this story is pretty gory. Please skip it if you're made uncomfortable by this kind of thing.\n\n15 years ago, I was just out of FTO and on patrol with a partner when dispatch called us over the radio and asked us to go assist with a medical call WAY out in the county, pretty close to the county line. The only information we had at the time was that it was some sort of tractor incident. Looking back on it, it was right around Halloween, so we likely just passed the 15th anniversary of this incident. We were the first unit dispatched, the other unit was also a 2-man car, with a full-time guy and a new reserve.\n\nWe got to the scene of what was then, and still is, the most horrific farming accident I have ever seen.\n\nThe woman in question was about 50, and she was bushhogging a field for the first time in several years. Her old ford tractor hit something, and threw her forward off the tractor. The shift in weight was sufficient for the tractor to unstick itself, and it ran over her.\n\nFortunately for her, it was an old tractor, and not very powerful, as her body was enough to bog down the bushhog and kill the motor.\n\nI was the first person to arrive on the scene. \n\nWhen I walked over from the car to the tractor, literally all I could see of this woman was her head with a few little scrapes, and a bit of what I thought was her hand, which was pretty mangled.\n\nIt wasn't her hand. It was her foot.\n\nAfter the ambulance arrived, and the medics were prepped and ready to go, the 4 deputies who were on-scene bodily lifted both the tractor and the bushhog (it was seized in place on the 3-point hitch) and threw it to the side. I don't know how much weight we moved, but it was easily more than a thousand pounds.\n\nWhat we uncovered was, without a doubt, the most horrific mangled body I've ever seen where the person was still alive.\n\nHer left leg was flayed open from just below the groin to halfway down her left lower leg. What little bits of bone that remained were embedded in her muscles and fat. \n\nHer right leg was broken in at least 5 places, and flopped around like... I don't even have something to compare it against. A half filled water balloon? Just pretend that a magic spell caused to the bone to disappear.\n\nBoth feet were completely destroyed. Between the soft tissue damage from the blades and the shattered bones, it was hard to tell where the leg ended and the foot began.\n\nI can tell you to this day that on what remained of her toenails, she was wearing sky-blue nail polish.\n\nThen her arms: each arm was smashed to bits. Massive gaping wounds, shattered bones, and what remained of hands were held on only with flesh.\n\nHer torso was actually in pretty good shape. There was another massive wound where her right leg hooked into the hip, on the backside right below where the crease of her butt would meet the leg, but the abdomen and thorax were pretty much OK.\n\nAll this being said, the woman was conscious. Not just conscious, alert and fairly well oriented. She was obviously in massive shock, but was able to talk with my partner from the moment we arrived until we slid her into the helicopter to fly her to the trauma center. \n\nI'll never forget that call, if for no other reason that the woman survived. To this day and forevermore, I'll never be able to explain how other than true divine intervention on her behalf. I've seen victims of car accidents and crimes that would disgust the most sadistic serial killer that died from injuries way less severe than what this woman encountered.\n\nI'll always remember gathering around with the other guys right after that call, regrouping and taking about how we had no idea how she was alive when we got there. Her injuries were, rather fundamentally, incompatible with life. \n\nAnd she fought like a trooper. True, she did eventually succumb to her injuries, but hung on for quite a while. 5 or 6 weeks, if I remember right, and I do know that she eventually died from renal failure, not from the injuries themselves.\n\nHow did I cope? \n\nI called my girlfriend (now my wife), and when I got home from that shift I explained everything that I did in gritty detail. She told me that what the boys and I did likely saved her life, and that we were doing God's work that night, and that there was nothing to be sad about.\n\nWas it horrible and horrific? Absolutely. This woman's injuries were so terrible, I wouldn't wish them on my worst criminal offender or enemy.\n\nBut, every so often, I get to do some good work. Certainly not every shift, not every week, and sometimes not every month. But every so often, I get to do God's work, and that's why I love this job.\n\nThat was one of those days.",

        "text": "Biggs and I were reclined in our chairs, watching a boring Monday Night Football game and trying not to fall asleep. Our presenter from the intelligence section was supposed to have been in roll call half an hour earlier but, as our boss explained, had become “sidetracked.” I could have predicted as much, having worked alongside Jim on many assignments. He was a career cop, a bit manic and still enthralled by his job, having put in time in multiple states before ending up in our agency. His specialty was, somehow, alcohol law.\n\nThe door swung open and in stormed Jim. “Sorry I’m late! I had to swing by Elm Street Tavern and do an inspection because my informant said they were selling untaxed cigarettes. Mother lode!” He held up a clear evidence bag with half a carton of cigarettes in it. \n\n“Mother lode?” I muttered in Biggs’ direction. \n\n“I think he uses a different unit of measurement for his excitement. Like, metric, or something.” Biggs replied, a half annoyed expression mirroring my own feelings towards having to lose valuable street time due to the seizure of some measly cigarettes. \n\nLt stood up and shook Jim’s hand. “Jim here has some intel on a new trend in the area. He’s asked for our help in shutting it down.” He looked over the group assembled in the roll call chairs – me and Biggs with our third Musketeer, Costa, as well as the six members of the Bike Team.\n\n“‘Sup guys?” Jim started. We all grunted a reply in unison, most of us still watching the Cowboys make a mockery of themselves on national television.\n\n“So – most of you know I used to be an ABC agent in another state.” He waited a beat for some confirmation from us, though it wasn’t to come. “Anyway, a big part of the alcohol laws have to do with taxes. You can home brew, make your own wine, hell – even distill some spirits in your backyard! – but as soon as you try to sell it, that’s when you run into an issue.”\n\nThere was another awkward silence as Jim waited for our enthusiasm in the topic to catch up to his. “Soooo… that’s where this new info comes in. My CI said he found a bunch of Bolivian places selling homemade alcohol. I’d like to start ramping up the pressure on these places in order to figure out where it’s coming from.” \n\nCosta perked up. “Is it a South American drink? My grandma is Bolivian.” Biggs and I both sighed in annoyance. Costa seemed to vary his ethnic background daily to suit the situation we were in – one day he was a third generation Brazilian immigrant who spoke fluent Portuguese, the next he was the product of Central American refugees and could understand Spanish though not speak it back. \n\n“Was it your grandma who can trace her lineage to Cristóbal Colón?” I over-rolled the R in Cristobal to mock Costa’s inability to do the same. “Or the one who grew up in the Amazon rainforest?” \n\n“Whatever dude. My Grandma, like, grew up in Bolivia.” He spat over his shoulder at me before addressing Jim again. “Is it called cha-cha or something?”\n\n“Chicha is what the CI said. It’s corn beer or something, I don’t know.”\n\n“Yeah!” Costa exclaimed, “I’ve tried it! It’s pretty good.”\n\nBiggs clapped his hands in mock congratulations. “Costa actually got something half right! Good job buddy!”\n\n“Shut up. So, what’s the plan Jim?” \n\n“Well, the bars should be in full swing so we’ll divide them up and head out. Anyone who gets anything to follow-up on can hit me up and we’ll re-organize. Sound good?”\n\n“Yep!” Lt stepped in. “Let’s hit it guys.”\n\nBiggs and I doubled up and were assigned to a dive bar in the Barrio known for its propensity for knife fights once the booze stopped flowing. I knew the bouncer at the door and told him we just wanted to step inside to see how the clientele was handling themselves. (You never know who’s going to be in on secret, untaxed alcohol sales…)\n\nPolka music with a nasally voice lamenting in Spanish about lost love and his heart hurting overwhelmed my senses as I made my way through the throng of revelers and back to the bar. The manager was wiping up a spilled beer and two men dragged a third away from us as we approached. \n\n“Too much chichi?” I asked the manager.\n\n“Huh? Too much what?” He was taken aback. \n\n“Chichi. Y’know, like, corn beer?” I began to doubt myself as it dawned on the manager what I was referring to. \n\n“Oh, chicha!” His face transitioned from recognition to fear. “No. He was drinking beer. Coronas. With lime.”\n\nBiggs ticked his tongue and shook his head next to me. “C’mon man. It’s done. Where’s the chicha?” \n\nThe manager’s shoulder slumped but he made no move to give up his stash. Instead he offered, “I’m all out.” His voice was an octave deeper due to shame. “But, if you don’t get me in trouble I can tell you who’s selling it!” He brightened at the prospect of snitching. \n\nBiggs and I exchanged barely concealed, excited glances. “Yeah,” I told him. “We can work something out.”\n\nThe manager pointed us in the direction of another bar I’d never heard of across town. He said the manager there made the chicha himself and sold it out to other bars for those “patrons wanting a taste of their home country.” We thanked him, lingered at the TV to get an update on the score, then rolled out front to call Jim and his “cha-cha expert,” Costa, a call. \n\n“Yeah, he said the name but I can’t repeat it – La Stanjatalcalapal or something, I don’t know. It’s at Main and Hickory though. Want to meet us there?”\n\nJim was elated. “We can be there in ten. Don’t go in without us!”\n\nA few minutes later, Biggs and I idled in front of the joint. It was a tiny bar wedged between a drycleaners and Bodega but business seemed to be flourishing. Costa and Jim walked up and Biggs and I jumped out to join them at the door. A burly bouncer gave us no problems and we walked in. The temperature difference was immediate and severe. It felt almost tropical and not due to the heat cranked up – the press of the patrons and their hot, alcohol tinged breath assaulted my eyes, skin, and nose with the same vigor. They were almost all drinking from clear “party cups”, the Solo cup type, only the cheaper variety. \n\nI kid you not, a group of men huddled over one table held up their cups in unison and yelled, “Chicha!” before tipping back and downing the entire 12 ounces of the yellowish brew in one gulp.\n\nJim was beaming.\n\nWe made our way back to the bar area and past it, into the kitchen. A scantily clad waitress noticed and her eyes grew large before she retreated further in. Costa yelled, “Hey!” and stumbled after her, tripping on some produce boxes. We all followed shortly behind and the narrow hall opened up to a dimly lit stall – maybe an old walk in fridge? The floors were a dingy brown, more so around the baseboards, and it smelled of rancid meat and mildew. A single bulb hung down from about the middle of the ceiling and on a folding chair underneath it sat an ancient old lady, wrinkled and gazing lazily at the group of us in the doorway. Her cheeks bulged obscenely and the waitress murmured, “Policia!” to her under her breath. \n\nAt that, the woman leaned down and spit out a wad of chewed grain into a huge stainless steel bowl, piled high with similar product. She wiped her mouth with her embroidered, white apron and gave us all a grey-toothed smile. \n\n“What’s going on?” A sturdy Hispanic male entered the room from what looked like an office beyond the woman. “Oh.” He continued, once he saw four confused police officers trying to figure out what was going on. \n\n“Chicha de Muko.” The old lady croaked. She motioned to the pile of chewed grain and the box of corn kernels on her other side. The hand motion continued over to a few cookie sheets of balled up, chewed corn, then to a large tank sitting in front of a counter. I walked over, hesitantly, and peered inside. A cloth bag of the chewed corn balls sat three-quarters submerged in a pool of liquid – the color of which appeared similar to that of the chicha being consumed out in the bar. I heaved, involuntarily, as it dawned on me what I was seeing. \n\nChicha was made with old lady spit. \n\nJim stepped up. “I’ll need your liquor license, your ID, and we’re going to shut you down for the night.” The grin on his face stood in stark opposition to my revulsion and Biggs and Costa’s confusion at my suddenly odd green tint.\n\nJim got his charges – a couple meager misdemeanors and the seizure of a few thousand dollars in undocumented alcohol income – and the chicha trade stopped in the region. \n\nI walked away with an irrational fear of unfiltered beer and ammunition to accost Costa with allegations of drinking his grandmother’s spit. \n",

Being as it's late there's no one around so I speed up to pass. I drive a diesel pickup turned up a bit so it smoked out of the exhaust when I hit it. As I get around I see headlights pull off a gravel road, and then the cherries come on... FUCK!\n\nSo I blip my hazards and pull off on the next gravel road about a mile up. I turn on the dome lights, roll down the window, and wait.\n\n\"Do you know why I pulled you over tonight?\"\n\n\"I'm guessing it's because of that little smoke show back there. Wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Ya, it was. And you were doing 5 over. License and registration.\"\n\nI reach down and grab it out of the glove box. As the Trooper looks at it he asks me where I'm headed so late. I respond that I'm just on my way home from work as a diesel tech on 2nd shift. He then asks me if I have any warrants or anything he should know about before he runs my info. Well I'm a smart ass and reply, \"Not in this state.\" I actually have no warrants and haven't even been pulled over in a long while.\n\n\"Step out of the vehicle.\" So I get out and he walks me to the back of my pickup, turns me around, cuffs me, and sits me on the bumper. \"Now don't move while I go run your info.\"\n\nSo I'm sitting there and waiting. After about 15 minutes the trooper comes out shaking his head with a smile on.\n\n\"You son-of-a-bitch!!! You had me going there.\" He said while chuckling.\n\n\"Ya, well I figured I could lighten up your boring night out here in the middle of nowhere.\" as I laughed as well.\n\nHe uncuffed me and sent me on my way without a ticket or anything.

I'll call him \"Jeff\" just to help the story flow better.\n\nThere was this well known \"frequent customer\" that existed along Jeff's beat.  A late 20-something, cross-dressing, flamboyantly homosexual, drug addicted male prostitute that would almost always end up getting arrested for doing something stupid.  Never arrested for anything major that would have kept him locked up for a while, just stupid shit like public disturbances, assault (usually over not getting the money he wanted for his, ehm, \"services\"), and so on.  Think Terry on Reno 911!, but not at all funny and many times more annoying.\n\nWell, it finally happened.  This guy got himself hopped up on a bit too much PCP and decided he was going to take on the police.  Drugs do crazy things to you, and PCP is one of those drugs that gives you an insane level of strength.  So even though this guy was rather lanky, he was actually doing an impressive enough job resisting arrest that backup was called in from anyone nearby to help subdue him.  As I said earlier, this wasn't in the modern day - this was in a different time when police didn't have tools like tasers at their disposal.  Back then, as they eventually had to do, force escalation eventually went from hands to batons.  \n\nNow, when you're trained to use a baton, you're taught to go for big targets on the limbs (thigh, shin, forearm, etc.)  You're also taught to not go for areas like joints, the neck or the head since impacting those areas can cause significant damage and could result in a viable lawsuit over excessive force.  Despite this training, there's no guarantee that you'll actually hit what you're aiming at - especially when you're dealing with a drug addict with superhuman strength that's flailing all over.  So nobody really knows if it was an accident or not, but eventually this guy took a baton to the skull and ended up in a coma.\n\nThe guy's mother finds out what happened to her little \"angel\", and - sure enough - filed a lawsuit against the department.  Now, even though this happened on Jeff's beat, he wasn't a part of it - the whole thing went down on one of his days off.  Clearly, though, word about this whole thing made its way through the department like wildfire, so Jeff heard about it pretty much right after it happened.\n\nFast forward a few months - the lawsuit the mother filed is finally being considered by the court.  The whole incident has gathered media attention.  On the steps of the courthouse, the guy's mother stands with her lawyer, telling the media about \"the terrible things those awful cops did to my boy\" - who, still at this point months later, remains in a coma in the hospital.  \n\nAs this press conference is happening, Jeff just happens to be walking up the steps to hand in some documents at the courthouse.  He heard about everything that happened in this incident, then he overhears the sob story being sold to the press, and - in what one could describe as an unfortunately profound lapse in judgment - Jeff says under his breath, though loud enough for the mother and the press to hear it, \"Lady, you're just upset because you had a fruit and now you have a vegetable\".\n\nJeff earned himself two things from that comment - four weeks of administration desk duty, and a legend that still follows him to this day.",

        "text": "I'm an aspiring Law Enforcement Officer. In one of the cities I am close to employment with, I decided to do a ride along with an officer to see what a typical shift is like.\n\nThe shift started at 11PM, but at around 12:30AM, my riding officer and I responded to a commercial burglary \"in progress\". The suspects were long gone. We did the whole \"cop thing\" and secured the area, phoned the shift commander, started the report, and waited for Crime Scene Investigations (CSI) to show up. The suspects entered the business through the large front window by throwing a large rock through it. There was glass and shards of rock everywhere.\nAt around 2AM, the store manager finally shows up. The poor guy had to drive an hour and a half to get to the store. By this time, CSI was done with their tasks and we began to look at the security footage.\nAs a ride along, you should dress somewhat sharp. It's respectful and obviously looks good especially if you're applying with the department. I had on khaki pants, a long sleeved green button down collared shirt, and a \"dressier\" jacket. Very business casual...\n\nWhile the CSI team, the store manager, my riding officer, and I were reviewing the security footage, a supporting officer showed up. I could tell immediately he was sort of an air head. He walks in and says, \"wwwwhhhhhoooooaaaaaaa. They used a freaking boulder!?\" The tone in his voice made me laugh a little, but I just minded my own and kept my eyes on the footage. I came to find out that this placed had been burglarized three times prior over the past three months. The air head supporting officer kept looking at me kind of awkwardly, but I ignored it.\n\nHe then asked where the bathroom was. The store manager told him, but the supporting officer was looking at me when he asked. My riding officer and the CSI team asked, \"does he think this kid works here!?\" And sort of laughed it off.\n\nThe officer comes out of the bathroom and after a few more minutes of conversation he starts giving me tips on how to keep the business more secure. My riding officer starts snickering, but I decided to play long. I had about a 15 minute conversation with this officer on how to be more secure in the future. He even recommended that we put \"dummy\" phones on the shelf to fool potential thieves (it was a phone store that got burglarized). I even took fake notes in my little notebook on his recommendations! After torturing the Officer for about 15 minutes, I finally asked him, \"So what exactly makes you think I work here?\" My riding Officer, the CSI team, and even the store manager started busting up laughing. He tried to defend himself by saying things like \"well damn you're not in uniform\" and \"you're not a suspect, are you?\" He then finally asked my riding officer, \"shit is this guy a rider??\" My riding officer in mid-laughter just nodded at officer air head. He took a lot of crap from everyone until we left around 2:30am.\n\nGot a good laugh out of a bad situation. Let's just say I really want on with this department even more now.\n\nOriginally posted in /r/IDontWorkHereLady",

He walked up to the driver's side window, looked down at me, 8 years old at the time, sitting there, and did a double-take.\n\nGrandpa was a rural mail carrier who got a car where the steering wheel is on the right- where the passenger usually sits- which makes putting mail into mailboxes easier since there's no reaching over the center console repeatedly.

        "text": "A few days ago, my uncle, an air medic in Florida, was up near me to teach and take an EMT recert class.  When he was here, he told me this kind-of-hilarious experience he had one day.  This is most of what I remember, as he told it:\n\nA few months ago, he was returning in the EMS helicopter to the air base from a medical call with a coworker, Jake (name changed), a former Cobra pilot.  While flying back, they heard on the radio chatter about a pursuit in progress.  Some junkie had stolen a semi truck (without the trailer), and FHP was chasing him.  After arguing for a little while about what to do, they decided to quickly get in one of the SO’s helicopters (I think they share a hangar) and join the pursuit.  20 minutes later, when they could finally see the chase, the truck had turned off of I-95 onto another highway.  FHP had set out stop sticks and had blown out a tire, but he was still going.\n\nSome time during the pursuit, the guy had dropped a bag of drugs out on the road.  Jake was shouting, “Mark it!  Mark it!”  My uncle replied, “I can’t!  All I can see is trees and the road!”  “Well then, mark a tree!”  “I can’t, they all look the same!” \n\nA little bit later, Jake had a plan, which consisted of flying in front of the truck and facing it head-on, nose-to-nose.  So he flies in front of the truck and they eventually meet up and they start to fly backwards.  Over the loudspeaker, he commands, “St Lucie SO!  Stop the truck, or we will RAM YOU!!!! [Don’t worry; we’re not going to ram him].”  Mind you, they’re in a Kiowa helicopter.  He then proceeds to unholster his sidearm and gives it to my uncle, who isn’t really a gun guy.  He says, “Point it at him.”  “Are you sure?!?!”  “Yeah, it’s fine.”  “Is the safety on?”  “Yeah.”  [aside – it might have been a Glock, so I don’t think there is a REAL (manual) safety].  So he proceeds to lean out of the helicopter as much as he can, aiming it at the perp, flying close to the ground, speeding backwards down an active highway.  Eventually, after weighing that threat, the guy eventually stops and the ground units catch up and arrest him.  Quite an experience, huh? \n\nWhen they went to find the bags after the pursuit, they spent a good 2-3 hours walking down the highway, looking for the bag, which they eventually did find.  I don’t remember what he was charged with, but it probably included felony evading and possession of narcotics.",

        "text": "Devon and I were parked driver’s door to driver’s door, cars idling and eyelids barely winning their battle with gravity. We had been assigned to a “special detail” – monitoring the day labor site at the barrio’s 7-11 due to a spat of strong armed robberies of just-paid workers. Clearly, our mere presence was enough to spoil any action our job could have made us privy to. \n\n“Simpson’s characters, go.” Devon challenged. \n\n“Apu.” I spat back, surprising myself with the speed with which I jumped from my daze.\n\n“Bart.” Devon was still resting his head on the headrest, eyes now shut from either boredom or concentration. \n\n“Cat Lady!” \n\n“Barely a character but I’ll let it slide. Doctor Nick.”\n\n“Cat Lady is too a character. She’s been in, like, ten episodes or something.”\n\n“Yeah, but the obvious answers are Chief Wiggum and Comic Book Guy. They’ve actually had plot points, not some moronic running joke about throwing cats.” Devon was still resting his head. My argument wasn’t worth the effort of losing his comfortable head divot. \n\n“Whatever. What letter were we on?” \n\n“E. And there’s another obvious one here. I won’t take “elephant” in place of Stampy for instance, cheater.”\n\n“Fine… Uhhh… Eeeeedddward?”\n\n“Who’s Edward?” Devon turned to examine me with a skeptical glare.\n\n“One of… the kids in the… uh… school?” I had lost but took a last swing for posterity’s sake. \n\n“No. You lose. The obvious one was Edna Krabappel, by the way. Loser.” He returned to his previous pose and once more shut his eyes. \n\n“How much longer!??!” I implored my steering wheel as much as Devon, knowing he was as annoyed with our assignment as I was. \n\n“I guess until evenings hits the streets.” Devon was surprisingly calm considering how short his fuse usually was when it came to bad decisions made by our supervisors. We all knew the robberies wouldn’t be solved by sitting in the area where they occurred. We also knew putting us here was a knee-jerk reaction by our boss due to the commander realizing there might be an issue. It was going to make the numbers drop, that was certain, but as soon as the next problem came along and we were reassigned to another area, the robberies would blow up again. \n\nAs if my complaint to the steering wheel gods was actually heard and deemed an actionable plea, my phone started buzzing in my pocket. \n\n“Hey sarge!” I answered, trying to sound like the team player he hoped I was. \n\n“Any action up there?” He sounded almost as bored as I was.\n\n“Nope. Seems we have an annoying case of voluntary compliance on our hands.” I scanned the crowd of day laborers, looking for any sign of unrest. They had slowly herded themselves to the far end of the parking lot we were sitting in, as far from our cruisers as possible while still occupying the narrow swath of asphalt designated for them to wait on jobs. \n\n“Well, I’m bored. I’m coming to replace you guys. We have a bunch of calls on hold.”\n\nRelief from the boredom, but at what cost? I hit the button on my computer that would show me the pending cases and saw several backed up in my usual area. \n\n“Oh… great, yeah. See you in a minute.” I hung up and turned to Devon to break the bad news. “Sarge is en route; he’s going to take over so we can knock out the calls on hold.\n\nDevon mad a ticked click of his tongue and sat up, tapping the pending button on his computer as well. “So we’ll knock out the suspicious event then each take a couple of the BS hit and runs and property calls?” \n\n“Sounds like a plan.” I clicked the details block for the suspicious event. “Ohh, this could be good: ‘Caller states he hears screaming coming from the apartment upstairs. States there has been a lot of foot traffic all morning.’ What the hell is that about?”\n\n“Hopefully a serial killer.” Devon mused in a droll tone. \n\nSarge arrived and we bid him farewell as we made our way to the other side of the barrio where the call was waiting on us. We met with the complainant in the foyer of the apartment building. \n\n“Yeah, man. There have been people coming and going all day. One guy came out and had blood all over his shirt. He kinda stumbled up the way there. I’m just worried some weird shit’s going down and I don’t want my daughter coming home from school and getting jumped on or something.” The heavy set man was sweating and glancing nervously up the stairs toward the offending apartment. “I mean, you should’ve heard that lady screaming. I don’t know what the hell’s going on but it’s freaky.”\n\nI thanked him and Devon and I made our way up past the apartment to the floor above it. “Keep an eye out for anyone coming in and I’ll listen for any weird noises.” I was willing to drag things out and investigate this thing the “right way,” calls on hold (mundane as they were) be damned.\n\nA few minutes into our surveillance, an old man slowly approached the building, consulting a scrap of paper and double checking the address before entering the foyer and making his way to our target apartment. Devon gave the thumbs up as the old man knocked on the door – two quick raps, one a second later, then three more quick – and the door opened. There was an exchange of welcome in Spanish as the man was ushered in and the door shut. We waited a few more minutes in silence, both Devon and I straining to listen to the goings-on in the apartment. Then, a strange buzz broke the silence, followed by a hammering, mechanical sound and screams of pain from one of the occupants in the apartment.\n\nDevon and I exchanged shocked expressions then, on Devon’s nod to go, slowly made our way to the door. He reached out and knocked – two fast, one solo, three fast – and the noises stopped. The door swung open and a chubby Hispanic female answered, smiling and wearing a surgical mask.\n\n“Hi, how are y-“ I started, but the door was suddenly slamming towards us. Devon stuck out his foot and I could tell he was straining against the weight of the woman who was now ramming her shoulder into the cheaply made, wooden door. \n\n“Stop… doing… that!” Devon growled, timing his words between slams. He finally had enough and threw the door open, causing the woman to stumble to the floor. \n\nThe sights we saw in the seconds after our entry were remarkable in both their quantity and gore. Bloody gauze was strewn all over the floor, some a dull brown, some still bright red. Various power tools – saws, drills, air compressors, dremels – were stacked on a low book shelf. Some of them had bloody smears on the handles as well as the working ends. Two men were sitting on a dingy brown couch. One, the old man we watched enter, seemed worried by our presence. The other was too concerned with some obvious pain he was enduring and seemed to not even take note of us. The woman was scrambling to get to her feet and yelled back towards the kitchen, “Stop! Stop! POLICEPOLICEPOLICE!”\n\nDevon put a hand on her shoulder before she could stand, and passed her, drawing his sidearm and cautiously yet quickly walking to the kitchen. I did the same but also held back slightly, keeping an eye on the woman and two sitting men. The woman made to get up again but I pointer my left index finger at her and said, “Stay!” She collapsed to the floor once more and pouted while surreptitiously eyeing the still open front door. I glanced towards Devon again and bent my head back to see what was in the kitchen. \n\nDevon was holstering up and muttering something. I noticed a man’s head, jutting out at a strange angle from the right to left. The man’s mouth was spread open with some dirty looking plastic device and his eyes were darting around frantically. Devon was staring at something just outside my field of vision and seemed either angry or disgusted – maybe both. \n\nThe old man we followed in stood up and started confidently walking out, drawing my attention. “SIT” I yelled at him too. He complied but complained about being late for another appointment. \n\n“You, get up and go out to the living room.” Devon nodded to the angled head of the sitting man who immediately followed orders. He came through the door, into the living room – mouth still wedged open and blood oozing down the Red Lobster bib covering his shirt. Several bloody gaps were obvious in his lower row of teeth. He sat next to the old man who seemed unperturbed by the new couch mate. \n\n“Now, put down the scalpel and go out too.” Devon was addressing someone else in the kitchen. I heard the klink of metal on metal then the scraping of a chair across cheap linoleum. A short, fat man waddled out of the kitchen a moment later, trailed by Devon. The man was wearing a cheap painter’s suit, speckled all over with blood and gore. His hands were bare but also decorated with spatters of brown. The paper mask he was wearing was yellowed around the edges and its rubber band was digging a trench in his neck rolls. He looked from me to Devon, confused, while wiping even more blood off his wire rimmed glasses. \n\n“What is it? What is wrong?” He asked in English with a thick Central American accent. \n\n“You can’t figure that out?” Devon asked him, arms crossed across his chest and clearly annoyed. I took the opportunity to peek into the kitchen. \n\nThe “patient” had been reclined in a thread-bare lazy-boy chair. Streaks and stains of what was most likely blood had long ago taken up permanent residence on the upholstery near the head. A kitchen chair was pulled from the small table and angled at the recliner. A small table was standing next to it and various bloody tools were piled onto an off-white kitchen plate on top of it. \n\nA Husky air compressor was plugged into an outlet and the hose led to an actual dentist drill, lying on the dingy linoleum floor. An empty box of surgical gloves sat on the table and several bloody and crumpled gloves lay strewn in its proximity. A half-eaten chicken carcass wore one as a death shroud. \n\n“What the hell??!?” I asked the room in general as I entered the living room again. \n\nDevon just shook his head but the portly “dentist” tried to answer. \n\n“I help the people. Do the teeth work!” He still seemed confused as to why we had halted his procedure on the open mouthed man (he had pulled the spanner out and was experimentally probing his bloody teeth holes with his tongue, blood still oozing out of the corner of his mouth). \n\n“This isn’t a dentist office. It’s an apartment. And half of this crap is made to work on handy-man jobs, not people.” Devon swept his hand across the array of bloody tools on the bookshelf. \n\n“Well, tools are expensive.” The portly man offered with a shrug.\n\nI leaned in to Devon. “What the hell are we going to charge these guys with?” I whispered.\n\n“Hell if I know. There’s got to be something though.” Devon answered, still scowling at the “dentist.” “Give Sarge a ring, see if he knows.”\n\nI did just that while taking a mental inventory of the accoutrement. Sarge answered on the second ring.\n\n“This shit is boring.” \n\n“Yeah, I know. Thanks for taking it from us.” I laughed back. “So, you ready for this?” I gave him a moment to brace himself. \n\n“For what?”\n\n“We found a dentist.” I smiled into the receiver, waiting for the accolades and questions. \n\n“Well, good for you. Finish up with him and get back to work.”\n\n“Huh? Well, do you know what we should charge him with?” I was shocked by the lack of shock from Sarge.\n\n“I don’t know, why’d you stop him?!?” Sarge was getting annoyed with me and it dawned on me I had failed to properly frame my reveal.\n\n“Ooooh, no. Not like an ‘upstanding citizen’ dentist who was speeding. No, Devon and I got a couple here running a dentist office out of their apartment. It’s… nasty.”\n\nIt took several follow up questions from Sarge to paint a clear enough picture that illustrated his need to see the spectacle in person. He arrived and took it all in, disgust clear on his expressive face.\n\n“What the hell??!?” He asked us. \n\n“Right?” I responded. \n\n“Well, this has to be against the law… I think. EMR, go get your code book and let’s sort this crap out. I’ll call some buddies in CID to see if they’ve dealt with this before.”\n\nI consulted the code book but had a hard time finding anything that fit. After several minutes and consultations with every entity we could think of, finally someone our intel unit had the epiphany – unlicensed dentistry! I looked up the code (well outside the usual traffic and criminal sections I usually consulted) and found a relevant misdemeanor. In a foot note below it, however, was a reference to a felony – perform an invasive procedure without a license. \n\nWe ended up dragging crime scene through the apartment and having the whole thing documented on film. Our narcotics section became interested when we found a cache of Mexican anesthesia – the first time they’d been found in our area. When I asked the “dentist” why he hadn’t used it on the screamers, he answered, “They said I charged too much for it.” Tough SOBs. \n\nDevon and I ended up being recognized for our unusual case – the first illegal dentist in the jurisdiction as well! – but in the end, we found ourselves in familiar territory. \n\nI cleared my throat before addressing the room. “Commander is concerned about the growing trend of illegal dentistry in the area. Arrests are up two hundred percent in the past month. We’ll try and keep today’s role call training brief and to the point…”\n",

This is from sometime in the last year.\n\n\"Click it or ticket\"\n\n\"Buckle up! Its the law!\n\n\"Have you buckled your belt yet?\"\n\n\"Extra seatbelt enforcement on this road\"\n\nThings you read all the time on the road without thinking about it twice. Most people do wear the seatbelt, but there are others who dont. It may be out of shear bliss or ignorance as an elder -- but those are their decisions. Growing up in today' society, seatbelt laws have always been in effect for drivers and passengers. For the older generation, it was an option. For many its still an option. \n\nFor the lives of three teenagers, the decision something they soon will remember forever.\n\nA warm summer evening; a perfect day with a perfect sunset. A call comes across the radio. \"Vehicle rollover on interstate XX at 500th st. (redacted for safety). We start screaming eagle to this. As we're going we're getting updates from dispatch: the vehicle crossed lanes, through the median, and rolled across the other (oncoming) lanes.  Two people ejected.\n\nBy the time we arrive, the sun is just sinking across the horizon. Light is quickly fading.  The accident scene takes up the entire highway and looked like something straight out of a NASCAR crash with pieces everywhere.  In the road, two bodies and an overturned SUV. \n\nThe highway is shut down.\n\nCoworkers are going full medic on this scene quickly mending to only one of the bodies in the road and the one in the vehicle. One coworker releases his patient (the one in the vehicle) and the other one is still getting worked on heavily.  Coworker looks back and sees no one working on the one body in the road so he quickly runs over and find out why: theres brain matter coming out his ears and nose. No signs of life. No pulse.\n\nThe other body in the road was alive. Barely. They airlifted them off the highway to the nearest level 1 trauma center in the area. The medics say that even though we airlifted them that the chances of that man surviving are slim.\n\nThe person in the vehicle, wearing his seatbelt, walks away with minor injuries. His two friends, one dead, the other close it, were not.\n\nThe highway was shut down for 5+ hours while they worked on the victims and reconstructed the scene.

        "text": "This story takes place about 2 or 3 years ago, when I was around 14 or 15, not far from my house. I did the talking, and there were 2 cops. Cop 1 is a shorter, younger guy, a dick, but been with the dept for a while. Cop 2 is a bit older, but much nicer and genuinely friendly, not a dick. \n\nIt was a nice summer evening around 10:00 pm and I was hanging out with about 3 other people (I don't talk to them anymore) and we were walking around my neighborhood. We all decided to talk a walk to the local convenient store to pick up some chips and drinks for an all nighter we were going to pull. On our way there, we picked up another guy, mind you, there are 5 teenaged kids, including myself, walking around a neighborhood in the dark, we expected someone to call the police on us. Anyways, as we came to the store, we found it was closed, so we thought we would just hang out in front of it, until one of the guys' dad would pick us up. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes of being bored out of our minds, the 5 of us decide to walk around the building, no harm no foul right? Wrong. When we rounded the corner, there was a police car there waiting for us, they must've come round the back entrance of the lot. Cop 1 jumps out of the car and immediately draws on us, yelling for us to get on the ground. A couple guys turn to run, but I tell them not to unless they want to end up in jail, so they comply. We didn't get on the ground because, you know, 15 y/o us want to know what the piss is going on. Cop 2 get out and calmly asks one of us to come to the front of the car for a talk, so I oblige. Cop 2 asks us what we are doing out here and why we were just sitting in front of the closed store. I explain to them that we wanted some chips and drinks, but the place was closed, and we were waiting for a pickup. Cop 1 is being the usual dickmunch, being pushy and yelling a lot, while Cop 2 just wanted to know what was going on. After talking for about 5 mins, Cop 2 orders Cop 1 to holster his gun and get in the car, and he reluctantly agrees. \n\nCop 2 and I talked for about another 5 mins about random stuff, and he eventually let us off without as much as a warning. Needless to say, being polite and cooperative with the police can go along way. It even got me off of another incident with the same people and same Cop 2!",

        "text": "A good buddy of mine working a different call was dispatched to a domestic violence call.  As usual I always keep an ear out especially when a unit is on a call like that.  I hear my buddy come on, \"requesting an additional unit, non-coded.\"\n\nBefore he can finish, I mic up, \"show me responding.\" \n\nMy partner and I discuss what they think the other unit has, probably a pretty bad DV since it's South Central and my buddy, who normally can handle stuff between him and his partner, need an additional unit.\n\nWe roll up, the female is sitting handcuffed on the curb in front of the location, she doesn't appear to be too battered.  The male is handcuffed but on the steps of the porch to the residence.\n\n\"Hey guys, just got a basic DV here, can you just get a shake on the guy, we are interviewing the girl.\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\" I reply.\n\nI walk over to the male who is sitting handcuffed on the porch.\n\n\"What's going on dude?\" I say to him as I walk over (this is south central, it beckons you to be a bit more relaxed with people).  As I get closer, I can see that he has an IMMENSE knot right above his left eye.\n\n\"Meeeeeeen, you know.\"  He scoffs.\n\n\"God damn, what happened to your face?\" \n\n\"Meeeen, listen.  I ain't do shit.  All I was tryna do was, I is came from my girlfriends house to my baby momma's house.\"\n\n\"Oh this is your baby momma over there?\" I gesture to the female handcuffed on the curb.\n\n\"Yee, she my wife.  Anyways, like I said, I was comin from my girlfriends house to come talk to my wife.  And you know, we was just talkin'.\"\n\n\"Yeah alright, talking and then what happened.\"\n\n\"You know, we was just talkin' and then she smelt some stank on my swing low, and hit me in the face with a smoothie!\"\n\nI'm absolutely baffled at this point.  The look on my face is priceless I'm sure.  I stutter a bit I'm so stunned.  \"Like...Like from Robeks?\"\n\n\"Nah man, you know, a smoothie!  You know, to smooth out clothes, an IRRN.\"\n\n\"OOH, an IRON.  Gotttt it.  So basically you and you're wife were having sex\"\n\n\"Yee.\"\n\n\"And I'm also assuming you had sex with your girlfriend before seeing your wife and didn't shower.\"\n\n\"Yee.\"\n\n\"So when you and your wife were doing it, she smelt your girlfriend on your dick, picked up an iron, and struck you in the face with it?\"\n\n\"Yee man, she smelt some stank and that bitch hit me in the face with a smoothie.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"  I say, shaking my head in the absolute disbelief of the situation.  My partner at the time had to excuse himself to laugh it off.  I told the primary unit what he said, and they couldn't believe it either.  \n\nI walked over to the female who was cuffed, \"That guy over there says you hit him in the face with an iron.\"\n\n\"Yee I hit dat mutha fucka!  He been messin' roun' with other women!\"\n\nI turn to the primary unit, \"Well it looks like you got what you needed.\"",

        "text": "(I touched on a terrible case I assisted with in my last story, “[The Fingerprint Guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2hzh3b/officer_the_fingerprint_guy/)”, but I may have failed to mention I was taken off the street to assist with that investigation. Biggs and I had been selected by the lead detective to help out (along with a few other guys from the district station where the crime occurred) and we formed a loose task force. Seeing as we had the case closed in a matter of a day or two (dumb luck really, maybe I can get into it in more depth later), the task force quickly lost its purpose and dissolved as the other guys were needed to return to the street to fill out patrol staffing numbers. Biggs and I, however, were in that “special criminal investigation” team I’ve mentioned before, so we had a ninety day temporary assignment to fill before we were expected to return to our regularly scheduled program. Anyway, that’s what leads to this story, focusing on another heinous crime we were tapped to assist on.) \n\nBiggs and I were the last to take a seat in the briefing room of the Investigations Section’s large conference room. We shuffled into a row of seats near the back of the room and once seated, took out our notebooks, ready to absorb any morsels of information that might aid in showing the full-time detectives we deserved to be in their ranks. I noticed -pen poised over legal pad- that we were the only ones who seemed to be “prepared.”\n\nAnnie was reclined in her chair, one foot kicked up on the chair in front of her, the other removed from its uncomfortable looking shoe, toes flexing in nude stockings as she winced in pain. Joe was holding a one sided conversation with Derek about his latest white-tail hunt. Apparently he had seen a few huge bucks but didn’t take the shot because his “keen hunter sense told him there’d be a bigger one later in the season.” Derek barely feigned interest, instead gazing, as inconspicuously as possible, at Annie’s arching toes. He was a bit of a creep, known for his encyclopedic knowledge of strange fetishes and odd sexual remarks interspersed in otherwise normal office talk. Josh, the reason Biggs and I were on our temporary assignment in investigations, was up front, talking with Jack - the lead detective on the case we were about to be briefed on. The Lt was trying to calm down an over-heated argument between another two of his detectives, Wally and Nicki – two hot-heads who constantly bickered like an old married couple over every imaginable topic. He quickly became exasperated and called the briefing session to order.\n\n“Jack, let’s get started so we can get the hell outa here.” He physically separated Wally and Nicky, shoving each on their respective shoulder, and sat between them like a human Berlin Wall. I looked to Biggs and we both shrugged our shoulders at one another. \n\n“Ok. So!” Jack pushed a button on the small remote he was holding and awoke the idling overhead projector. A photo of a fully nude elderly Hispanic woman, arms and legs spread and upset scowl on her face, popped onto the screen. Abrasions and bruises were visible over a large portion of her body. The crowd of detectives collectively groaned, either at the seeing the extent of injuries, or the visage of a naked, saggy old woman. “This is my victim, a maid at the Sleep-Inn on Main Street. She was abducted last week and beaten and raped in a vacant room at the motel. She had a hard time describing her attacker but gave enough details to narrow down height, age, and race. Her injuries are consistent with her story and the bruising here,” He shone a laser pointer to her neck, “Is from the bike chain the assailant used to drag her into the room by her neck.”\n\nJack clicked his remote again and a new picture, this time of a young male taken out in the street, popped up. “This is my possible suspect, Mike Jones. He’s a known trouble maker out there, weed peddler and gang member, and is well known to a few of us.” Josh and Annie shook their heads in agreement. “He’s popped up in info cases where he was suspected of peeping and otherwise acting creepy. Mr. Jones just happened to have skipped school the day this happened. No one I’ve spoken to can give me an alibi for him during my time-frame, though I haven’t approached him yet. He’s definitely not cop friendly and the same goes for his mom and step-dad. That’s where this operation comes in.” Another remote click and a PDF of a report popped up. “Mr. Jones screwed up last week and sold weed to a narcotics UC. They’ve graciously handed over the reins of the case to me so we’ll be hitting his residence with this search warrant and be looking out for anything drug related they can follow up on. Obviously, we’ll also be looking for anything tied to my case here while we’re inside and I’ll write another warrant if we need one.” Jack went on to give us a description of the clothing the victim recalled to include a distinctive hat and pair of shoes. “Anyone have anything before we hit it?”\n\nWally raised his hand, “Hit up Parker in Robbery. I think he was looking at this guy for one of his. He thinks this is the guy that beat the old lady with the chain and stole her purse last week.” Jack agreed with the suggestion and we were assigned our roles for the operation. Biggs and I pulled the short straws and were given “perimeter duty,” the equivalent to getting “potato peeling duty” in boot camp. \n\nAs we walked out, Biggs shook his head and sighed. “Whatever, right? At least we’re not pushing a cruiser around.” \n\n“Yeah, but I think we’re in for a long one.” I paused and glanced around. “It’s all so much less professional up here than I assumed, right?” \n\n“Yeah,” He replied, “But I’d still rather be here than out getting stuck on domestics and accidents all day.” Biggs had long made it known that his goal was to make homicide and he was well on his way to making a big enough name for himself in our ranks to make it there one day. My surprise in the lack of formality was trumped by his want to be one of the guys taking in the gruesome facts of a terrible crime like one of the jaded detectives we were just sharing a dark briefing room with. \n\nBiggs and I carpooled to the pre-service staging spot. Everyone formed an informal circle as Jack wrapped up a phone call. He then walked over. “Parker says Jones came onto his radar via a CI who was trying to make some cash. Apparently we need to look for a black purse with silver piping on it. The victim might be able to pick him out of a lineup but he’s not to that point in the case yet so anything we can find will help him. Also, it sounds like the chain he used to hit her was similar to what might have been used on my victim. He approached her on his bike and had it wrapped around the handle bars before he hit her with it so that’s doubly important to find now.” We all murmured some form of acknowledgement and made our way back to the cars to head to the targeted townhome. \n\nThe radio crackled as Biggs and I pulled into a parking spot down the street from the house. “EMR, Biggs: jump out and cover the rear. Let us know when you’re set.” I felt like grumbling a complaint but chose to remain silent upon realizing Biggs was basically skipping across the parking lot; impervious to the contempt I was feeling due to a want to be a “team player.”\n\nWe rounded the back of the row of townhouses that held our target location and I carefully picked my way through the muddy puddles left over from the torrential down-pour from the previous night. Investigations had a “business casual” dress code and I had purchased a new pair of leather shoes to last me my temporary assignment. Stomping through muddy puddles usually wasn’t an issue in my patrol boots, but the prospect of not having a clean pair of shoes the next day wasn’t doing anything to improve my mood. Biggs trudged on, still oblivious to my grumpiness. We got settled and kept an eye on the sliding glass door while Biggs gave the all clear over the radio. \n\nWe could hear the knock from the back of the house. Almost immediately the front door opened and let in light down the long hallway that led to the rear glass door. The shrill complaints of whoever answered the door were the next progression that told us our guys were inside. \n\n“Oh, nuh-uh! You aren’t gettin’ in here without a warrant!” A woman's voice complained loudly. I could picture her angry expression accentuated by a hand on her hip. I so wanted to be the guy who shoved the warrant into her face and quieted her complaints but alas, I was busy trying not to step in soggy dog crap. The slider slid open a few seconds later and Josh poked his head out. \n\n“We’re in, clearing the house. You guys are good to go around front now.” He slid the door shut and I grumbled to myself as I avoided more dog-mines and mud puddles and made my way around to the front of the house. Our duties now would consist of keeping an eye out in front to insure no one came in unannounced while the detectives searched the interior. \n\nAs soon as we made it up front, I knew it wasn’t going to be a field day for anyone. The woman who had answered the door was getting loud with the Lt on the front stoop.\n\n“I don’t care if you got a warrant or not, you all can’t come in here without me havin’ my lawyer here. I know my rights!” She was just as I pictured; hair up in rollers even though it was well after lunch time and grey sweat pants stretched to their breaking point, fighting a losing battle in keeping her reservoir of ass-fat from spilling out and ruining everyone’s day even more. \n\n“My husband is gonna fuck up all y’all when he gets home!”\n\n“Ma’am, there’s no need to make threats. We’re here legally and unless you want to end up in jail I’d suggest taking your voice down.” The Lt was sweating. I remember hoping he had taken his blood pressure meds for the day. \n\nThe homeowner, the mother of the target, begrudgingly acquiesced at the Lt’s threat but muttered, “I don’t care ‘bout jail. I’ll go back to jail and all y’all muthfuckas gonna pay…” under her breath with her arms folded across her chest and a pouty lower lip protruding.\n\nHer tirade had drawn the attention of the neighbors who I noticed were peeking out windows or storm doors. That neighborhood was use to its fair share of drama involving residents and the police and apparently everyone knew the newest episode was just starting. \n\n“Soooo… are we going to seize that bike?” Biggs was pointing to a spray-painted BMX bike that was tucked in the bushes in front of the house. It had a black-plastic covered bike chain wrapped around the handlebars. \n\nThe Lt looked at it with interest. “Is that..? Well crap! Good find Biggs! Hey Jack, c’mere!” \n\nJack came out, a skeptical look of annoyance creasing his face. He scowled at the still fuming woman as he squeezed by her to see why the Lt had called him out.\n\n“Take a look at what Biggs found.” He pointed to the bike and Jack’s expression changed immediately. \n\n“Holy crap, that’s it!” He looked up to the woman who had suddenly taken an interest in what was going on outside. “Whose bike is this?” He asked her.\n\nShe took a look and then, mouth squished into an exaggerated scowl of contempt said, “I don’t know. Could be anyone’s!” \n\n“Well, I guess it’s abandoned property then.” Jack slipped on some latex gloves and made his way to the bike but was stopped by the Lt. \n\n“Wait. You can’t take that under the abandoned property exception, can you? I mean, it’s on the curtilage. And it’s not in the scope of the warrant, right? Don’t you need to write a new warrant? Correct me if I’m wrong.”\n\n“Hmmm… good point.” Jack gazed into the sky, contemplating. “But, if it was just an abandoned bike we’d take it for safe keeping, right?” He addressed Biggs with the last question.\n\n“Oh, yeah. Just a property case.” Biggs replied, happy to be involved in making some important decisions in the investigation.\n\n“But, how are you going to process it? As abandoned property!?” The Lt wasn’t relenting. \n\n“Well, maybe to identify the owner?” Jack countered.\n\n“But we don’t normally do that, do we?” He asked Biggs. \n\n“Uhhh… no, no we don’t. We just take them to the station and make them releasable I guess.” Biggs answered. \n\n“But if we take it knowing it’s involved in a criminal case and possible evidence, how would…” The Lt trailed off. \n\nA creaking door caught my attention and I noticed a young girl opening the storm door to a nearby townhouse. A small black creature streaked out and the girl immediately reacted. “Oh no! Pepe! Get back here!! MOOOOM!” The girl took off after the dog but it was obvious she’d have no luck in corralling it. As soon as she got within six feet of it, the dog would dart off in another direction, frustrating its small caregiver.\n\n“But, what if she gives us consent to take it from her bushes?” Jack nodded up to the woman on the stoop, still trying to figure out the protocol with seizing the bike and it’s chain. \n\n“Well good luck with that.” The Lt guffawed. \n\nI was growing bored with the discussion and getting worried as the dog and girl duo made their way closer and closer to the parking lot. I decided I would revert to my community policing patrol ways and assist one of the little guys for a moment as I abandoned my post to assist the girl in her pursuit. \n\nThe dog saw me coming from a mile away, this new comer in his shirt and tie wasn’t going to get the upper hand on him. He darted away from the road back to the breezeway Biggs and I had used to depart the poop-ridden back yards of our prior assignment. The girl squealed with delight that I was helping her and took off after her puppy. \n\n“No, don’t run!” I called, but she was already out of ear shot. I trotted to catch up, tip-toeing through puddles and around turds once again. \n\nI caught up to the girl near a shed. “Ok,” I crouched down and talked to her in a low, urgent whisper akin to a quarterback getting ready to attempt a trick play. “You stay here and wait until I get to the other side of the shed. Then walk – slowly! – with your hands to your sides like this-“ I showed her how I wanted her to stalk, arms out and fingers splayed cutting off the dog’s escape route. “Then I’ll come around when he breaks for my side and I’ll grab him, ok?” \n\n“Ok!” She giggled, as proud to be involved in my scheme as Biggs had been with his involvement in the search warrant bike debate. \n\n“1-2-3 GO!” I took the driest path I could find to my side of the shed and gave a thumbs-up to the girl. She began creeping and making kissy noises at the dog (does that work?) as she approached, arms out like I had shown her. \n\nThe dog took her in and started slowly backing up, matching her pace and totally oblivious to my presence. It was almost in arm’s reach when it tensed, ready to sprint and I lunged for him, missing on my first attempt but reflexively grabbing him on my second. Unfortunately, try number two took me off my feet and I found myself on my side, elbow furrowed in mud and cold water seeping through my shirt and pants. The dog was in my hands, writhing in a last ditch escape attempt. The girl snatched him from me and gave a quick “Thanks!” before sprinting away with her prize. I remained on the ground, realizing I was going to have some explaining to do for my now drenched and muddy clothes. \n\nI was about to get up when I noticed something wedged under the shed. It appeared to be… a purse? I kneeled by the object, clearly black leather, clearly silver piping, and thought maybe I ought to show somebody my discovery. \n\n“Hey boss!” I called peeking back around the house, “I think I have something else over here.” He looked up from his ongoing discussion with Jack and nodded. A moment later he was by my side.\n\n“What the hell happened to you?!?” He asked.\n\n“Chihuahua. Check this out though.” I pointed to the purse. \n\nIt took him a moment but it suddenly dawned on him. “No way. Hey! Hey Jack, c’mere… again!” Jack came around to the shed. \n\n“What’s up?” He asked us. He stopped a moment and looked at my now less-than-business-casual attire in confusion before the Lt redirected him. \n\n“Check out what EMR found.” He pointed to the purse. \n\nJack glanced from us, skeptical but intrigued, before squatting and examining the find. “EMR, go get the camera.”\n\nI complied and jogged to the door, now oblivious to the dog-bombs and mud since I had already lost that battle. “Where’s the camera?” I asked Josh as I peeked into the house. \n\n“What happened to you?!?” He replied, ignoring my question. \n\n“Chihuahua. The camera?” He hurriedly left the room and came back with the evidence camera which I took charge of and made my way back to Jack and Lt. I took several pictures before Jack pried it out and searched the contents. There were few contents and a noticeably missing wallet. \n\n“Well, it could be, don’t know how we’ll prove it though.” Jack was about to give up. \n\n“Call Parker, ask him what else was inside the bag?” I suggested. \n\n“Worth a shot.” Lt agreed. \n\nJack dialed and we waited as he asked. “Uh huh. A bag of what? What’s that?”\n\nJack answered Lt’s questioning gaze with a whispered, “A bag of ‘dried durian'?”\n\nI poked through the bag, empowered with my knowledge of terrible Eastern fruit thanks to Andrew Zimmern, and there it was: An opened bag of, now moldy, dried durian. I showed it to the Lt, triumphant. \n\n“Well I’ll be damned! I guess we need to bring you and Biggs around to our search warrants more often!”\n\nThe kid was eventually tracked down and arrested and gave up his involvement in all the cases we thought he had a role in. He was eventually sentenced to a multi-decade long jail sentence, all told, and Biggs and I both made it to investigations a short time later. Thanks in large part, on my behalf at least, to the role of Pepe the Chihuahua. \n",

Fuck dat foo!\"  \n\nAt first I wanted to know what a SuperVisa was, because I am sure I use a Visa card on a regular basis but a SuperVisa I have not heard of, maybe it has some added benefits?

        "text": "This is a little story about the cops in my precinct.  I moved around a little bit before moving in with my girlfriend and moving into her house in what was previously a sketchy neighbourhood, but was recovering slowly.  There were still a few places one could go to score anything you wanted.  Everybody knew it, but the cops really couldn't do much.  They go in, bust everybody, but the dealers all got out in a day or two.  (I actually think the supplier was only giving them a little bit at a time to avoid these guys getting caught with a substantial amount.  Kinda smart, when you think about it.)  I'll detail how they finally left the neighbourhood in a later story.\n\nBut onto the show.\n\nI had left school a few years ago.  I started an apprenticeship, and things were looking up.  I was making decent money, got a decent car, and had a great girlfriend.  But I still came home from work filthy.  Hot-rolled iron was filthy stuff.  I get home one afternoon, hop out of my car, and pat my shirt pocket.  Shit, forgot my smokes at work.  I throw my lunchbox back in my car, and walk over to the corner store to grab a pack.  I leave the store, and start walking home.  On my way there, there's a police cruiser parked on the street before my house.  I'm just walking by, when a cop hops out of the passenger seat.  I swear to Christ, this guy was younger than me, and I was like 22.  I don't think anything of it, and I just keep my head down and keep walking.\n\nThe guy actually physically puts his hand in my chest, and says \"Hold up a minute.  Where you going?\"  (What the fuck is it to you, dickweed?  I'm walking down the street.  I got all night here, I gotta fuck with him a little.)\n\n\"I'm going that way, bacon bits. Outta the way.\"\n\nYou shoulda seen that scowl.  It looked like he practised it in a mirror.\n\n\"Not so fast.  I asked where you were going.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I give a fuck what you asked. I said I was going that way.\" (Point south.)\n\n\"So where you coming from?\"\n\n(Point North) \"That way.\"\n\n\"Look, there's a lot of drug activity in this neighbourhood.  I'd like to check your pockets.\"\n\n(Holy shit, does this guy think I'm a junkie, or is this the dumbest excuse for a search ever?  BTW, I was a 22 y/o cornfed construction worker.  I had like 40 pounds of muscle on him, and he's acting like I'm a junkie. Worst excuse for probable cause I ever heard.)\n\n\"Oh, you wanna check my pockets do you?  Well, I want a threesome with Britney and Christina, that ain't happening neither, chuckles.  Go find some probable cause and come back after you figure out what reasonable grounds for suspicion is.\" (Yeah, it was that long ago that Britney Spears was a sex symbol instead of a train wreck.)\n\nThis is where it gets funny.  The guy fucking grabs me and tries to shove me over the back of the cruiser to search me anyway.  I said tries to push me, because he fucking bounces off me.  I don't move.  It was like getting shoved by an eight year old.  But i figure if he's gone physical confrontation, the jig is up for fucking with him.  I turn towards the cruiser and slam my hands down on the trunk.  The driver makes eye contact with me.  As I'm getting a patdown from the other cop, he gets out.  Now this guy is a cop.  Late 30's, solid build, and a 'what the fuck is going on now' look.\n\nCop #2: (Cop #1) Stop.  What the fuck is going on now? (*Told you*)\n\nMe: Constable Peachfuzz here thinks I'm a junkie. (Yes, I recycled the term. I think it's fairly applicable for this guy.  He seriously looked like he didn't have to shave often.)\n\nCop #1: Shut the fuck up.\n\nMe: How about no?  You said you wanted to search me because I was walking down the street, in a neighbourhood with, I quote, 'A lot of drug activity'.  I refused, and you physically grabbed me and did it anyway.\n\nThere is a fair amount of eye-rolling and sighs from Cop #2.  The occasional muttered \"oh jeez\". I really wonder what this guy did to deserve the walking fuckup he's riding with.\n\nCop #2: Fuck. (Cop #1) Stop.  Let him up now.\n\nCop #2 gives me a once over.  I notice he looks at my feet, and he shakes his head.\n\nCop #2: So (Cop #1) Why did you stop him?\n\nCop #1, Well, dishevelled appearance, smoking, heading towards a known crackhouse.  Fit a profile, and became confrontational when I wanted to talk to him.  \n\nCop #2: I'd get a little confrontational if you asked to check my pockets out of the fucking blue, too.  Look at this neighbourhood. You walk in any fucking direction you're heading towards a known crackhouse.  Do you know how much shit this guy can rain down on you for this?  When somebody says \"No search\" you don't fucking search them unless they're under arrest!\n\nI can tell I'm about to get an apology, but i don't really care.  I had my fun.\n\nMe: Looks like we're done here. Can I go?\n\nCop #2 looks at me, and kinda smiles.\n\nCop #2: In a minute.  By the way, how much do you weigh? Like 220, 230?\n\nMe (*slightly confused*) About that? Why.\n\nCop #2 : (to Cop #1) Because the only way this guy's got any crack in his system is if he **ate** a fucking crackhead.  He's bigger than the both of us, and you're lucky he's not actually a scumbag, because he probably could kicked your ass.  Crackheads weigh in at about 150, tops. And as for the 'dishevelled appearance' you mentioned thinking that was grounds to search the guy? Look at his feet!  You know any crackheads wear workboots?  The guy's filthy because he works for a living.  (*looks at his watch*) It's 4:30, this guy's  trying to get home for a shower and a beer, and you call him a crackhead. (to me) That about right?\n\nMe: Pretty much.\n\nCop #2: Okay, take off.  Thanks for participating in my little 'help my co-worker be less of a dumbass' exercise.\n\nMe: No problem. (To Cop #1) Helluva week, huh? Learn about probable cause and how to shave all in the same week, eh?\n\nCop #2 snickers at that.  Cop #1 is about to open his mouth.  Cop #2 points at him like the monkey from 'Family Guy' as he's getting back in the car.\n\nCop #2: NOPE!  Keep it shut! Zip it!  You are not allowed to talk for 15 minutes.  No get in the fucking car.",

A party every now and then, but more often then not my Fridays were quiet, or at least spent with my girlfriend (yay, boobs!).\n\nI moved to the big city, and wasn't adapting well.  The tech school i went to was an art school in disguise, and art brats don't like small-town guys like me.  Get into one little argument where you invite a guy into an alley after someone insults your character and intelligence, and suddenly you're a pariah.  In short, I hated school.\n\nBut I loved city life. Noise, subways, people, confrontation, culture clash, it was great.  Variety. Food. Loved it.\n\nAnyway (yeah, I'm off topic. Sorry) My sophmore year, I lived in the 'burbs. Which meant 2 and a half hours of commute every day by bus and subway.  Didn,t exactly dread it, but this was back before cel phones could entertain you and Ipods hadn't been invented yet.\n\nOne day, I'm leaving class, and hea to the subway.  It was after dark, and the area my school was i wasn't so great after dark.  A lot of, shall we say, \"urban entrepreneurs\" took over the area.  I'm heading towards the subway entrance. The stairs were heading towards me.  As I'm walking towards them, I see a guy sprinting towards me. He's hauling ass. With a purse.  Then about fifty yards behind him, I see a cop in footchase, and shortly after that, another one.  But no way they're gonna get this guy if he hits the subway platform at 6:30 p.m.  \n\nSo fuck it, a little small town comes outta me.  As this guy with the purse reaches me, im at the top of the stairs.  I stick out my arm, and clothesline him.  Perfect catch. He even made a \"guwch\" sound as he went horizontal.  At a full sprint. Towards a flight of concrete stairs.  Maybe i overreacted a bit.  This dude goes ass over teakettle down the stairs, and just lies there. (oh fuck, did I kill him?). First cop actually unleashes a Nelson like \"ha-ha' when the guy goes airborne, and passes me with the hugest grin on his face.  Looking right at me when he goes by.  Second cop catches up to me and peers down the stairs at his partner handcuffing the mess at the bottom of the stairs, who is now making noise, so I know HE ISN'T DEAD.  Cop doesn't ay anything. Jst looks down the stairs for a second, then kinda gives a once over to 19 year old white boy me. Then he goes to the curb, and starts kicking gravel in front of the stairs. Scraping it, like a guy kicking dirt on an umpire.  Then he gives me another once over and looks me in the eye and says \" You saw him fall down the stairs too, right? That's what it looked ike from back there.\"\n\nI'm no dummy here.  \"Yessir.  Just shot down the stairs. Looks like he slipped on this here pile of gravel.\"\n\n\"Slippery, ain't it?  Why don't you use that entrance down that way and get out of here. My partner and i will help the guy who fell.\"\n\n\"Yessir. Have a good night.\"\n\nI think i'm gonna like big city cops.  You don't fuck with them, they don't fuck with you.",

So we took the collar for state #2 and state #1 will extradite later . \n\nLieutenant: \"anma1234 go with VeteranCop down to pick up the prisoner at the holding cells in state#2 and transport her to Central booking.\"\n\nWe arrive at our holding facility (which is a different command)  and park in front of 2 other police cars. We go in get the prisoner and walk out the front doors and stop dead in our tracks. Our Tahoe is gone. We have the keys. So there we are 2 cops standing on the sidewalk holding a prisoner staring at an empty spot, way longer than we should have.\n\nWe go back in and inform the Sgt. Who proceeds to follow us downstairs, look left, then right, scratch his head and start laughing. Finally VeteranCop turns to the Sgt. And asks \"wait do you guys have a Tahoe here?\"  The Sgt. raises his eyebrows, and begins to chuckle louder while keying his radio.  \"89-2 do you have a Tahoe?\"... \"yea A-ffirm\"...\"40 the front doors, you got the wrong truck.\"  \n\nAnd that's how we found out that all the Tahoe keys in the entire 2 state department are the same.",

        "text": "This is a short follow-up to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2cerkh/officer_the_s_i_put_up_with/) story I wrote.\n\nI was working overtime on the tactical shift which goes from 1700-0400 on a weekend. Manpower was down as always due to some departures and people burning leave before the turn of the fiscal year, and the subsequent end of the school year.\n\nI had just grabbed gear and checked out my bike keys when I happened across a strange conversation in the hallway outside of the equipment room between Sam and Ray.\n\nSam looked a bit perplexed as he leaned heavily against the wall. \"It just felt weird. The seat was too far forward and the monitor was stuck down with tape. I had to cut the tape to open the computer and someone zip-tied the seat-bar to the post bracket on the floor. I had to cut that off too. Then when I hit the accessory bar, someone had switched the siren to the auxiliary and the airhorn wasn't working. Had to get depot to figure out what the problem was.\"\n\nRay shook his head. \"This feels like a hazing...\" He was an Army vet, and knew when bullshit was afoot. \"I stepped in to the cruiser and the driver’s side floor was covered in brown crap. It was everywhere. Then, the laptop screen was taped down with double-sided sticky tape and the shifter was zip-tied to the steering wheel.\"\n\nSimilar reports of people encountering brown substances in lockers, computer mice and keyboards stuck to desks with tape, the men's locker room streaked with brown crud, and other similar things happening to the befuddled evening shift.\n\nI grabbed my bike and headed out, pondering as to what malady had befallen my fellow officers. I stopped off at the 7-11 to grab a drink. I went in to the trunk bag to grab the bicycle lock, and found it was filled to the brim with a brown substance. My water bottle, my bike locks, the little first aid kit, all of it covered in the stuff.\n\nI stopped off at depot to wash the substance out of the trunk bag. As I was spraying off the stuff, I noticed on the curb there was a large bucket full of what looked like the same stuff that was in my bike bag. Next to it was a box of baking soda and brown food coloring. It was mixed in to a thick paste that resembled runny diarrhea.\n\nStrange, I thought. I continued to wash off the stuff in my trunk-bag and discovered [this](http://i.imgur.com/lNu9Pwe.jpg) sticker on the front of my bottle. Immediately, I knew who the culprit was. Josh had this same sticker on the front of his locker. \n\nI walked in to the station, barged in to the property section where Josh was working, and saw him leaning way back in a comfortable chair with his feet propped up, reading the local newspaper. He looked up over his small framed glasses with a smile and shook the newspaper out like a sophisticated person of culture. \n\nI took one step towards him, and stepped right in to a paint-tray that was tactically placed right next to the door that was filled with the brown baking soda mixture. \"Payback’s a bitch, huh?\" He said, returning to his newspaper.",

        "text": "The trial had just started for a brutal home invasion/abduction/stabbing of a little girl (the details of which are waaay too disturbing to get into here, I still have nightmares about it) and a huge portion of the testimony rested on the validity of one of the fingerprint analysis that was done late one night after we locked up our suspect. \n\nThe analyst, we'll call him Bob, was slightly older, more than slightly overweight, had two hearing aids, and was prone to monotonous monologues that droned on and on - the kind of conversationalist that's so inept at the back and forth that the other party could quietly walk away and Bob wouldn't notice. He may be autistic. \n\nAnyway, Bob was the second witness, following the SANE nurse, and the defense attorney the suspect's family had mortgaged their house for was rearing to go, eager to rip into the meat of our case and had Bob in his predatory gaze. I was unaware of what was about to happen but my buddy, the lead detective on the investigation, had a sixth sense when it came to foreseeing hilarious situations and told me it would pay off if I sat through his testimony. \n\nIt started off normally enough, the prosecutor went back and forth, allowing Bob to mechanically recount the various schools and jobs (\"I attended the international Fingerprint Analyst Conference in Munich last summer\") he has had in the field of fingerprint analysis throughout the years - quite impressive actually. He moved onto the actual case and Bob knocked it out of the park, explaining exactly what features on the recovered/evidence prints matched those of the ten-print card he had taken the night we locked up the bad guy. \n\nThen it was the defense's turn. It didn't go so smooth.\n\n\"What are the odds two people could have the same prints?\" He asked, head nodding expectantly and fingers steepled into some pose he probably read about in a Tony Robbins self empowerment book. \n\nApparently that's not the question to ask the guy who loves his job and what it stands for more than anything else in this world, let alone one who has the social skills of a rhino at a tea party. Oh, and also, apparently Bob should've changed his hearing aid batteries before the trial began. \n\n\"Zero percent. Those aren't odds, it's a fact.\" Bob began, his monotonous voice revving up from a slow, low, drone and ended slightly quicker and more high-pitched. \n\n\"Well, two people can at least have the same markers on their prints, the three or four you pointed out in the prints you said belong to my client.\" The lawyer made a statement of it, assuming Bob could be manipulated into agreeing. He was wrong.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Bob leaned in, shaking his head and messing with one of his hearing aids, \"I missed that.\"\n\n\"I said,\" The lawyer was getting annoyed, \"two people can have the same markers on their prints.\"\n\n\"NO!\" Bob's face was turning red. \"The markers I determined to be the same on both sets of prints were only a few of the more than hundred uniquely identifiable features I could have pointed out. They were the most relevant as they were the most easily recognizable for the jury. I was told by the prosecutor to keep it brief!\" Bob then closed his eyes and leaned back his head. He began prattling off strange words and locations, obviously identifying other like-markers of the two samples from memory. The defense attorney tried to interrupt him but Bob's faulty hearing aid, and/or lack of conversational decorum, saw to it the request wasn't heeded. \n\nBob's voice finally slowed to a slow drawl as he came back to earth and his eyes opened once he leaned forward to take in the court. Everyone was uncomfortable and you could see the judge was not amused. \n\nThe defense should have cut his losses, but instead he doubled down against the savant. \"Well, what about twins?\"\n\nWe were regaled with a twenty minute lecture on how the prints develop in the womb, how the placental wall affects their shape, how the defense attorney may be thinking about DNA but even that idea is flawed. About chimeras and fetus-in fetu... the judge was about to blow his gasket and the defense attorney's attempts to get Bob's attention were rolled over as though they were in the path of a downhill steamroller. \n\nThe silence, once Bob felt he had educated the courtroom to the proper degree, was total. My buddy jabbed me in the ribs and made a wide eyed half-laugh, half grimace expression for me to validate my own feelings toward the parade of awkward we had just witnessed. \n\nThe defense attorney was defeated. \"No further questions.\" He slunk back to his seat and just shook his head at the questioning look given to him by the defendant. \n\nThe judge looked to the prosecutor who shook his head as well, indicating he did not wish to verbally wrestle with Bob again. \"No redirect.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\" Bob yelled into the microphone.\n\n\"He said he's done. You can step down sir.\" The judge was happy to have his leave of Bob.\n\n\"WHAT?\" Bob turned to the judge and screamed.\n\n\"Step down, have a seat, no more questions.\" The judge said, now rubbing the bridge of his nose where his glasses had been resting. \n\nBob looked around in an almost panicked state and a bailiff had to walk up and, tentatively so as not to startle him, touch his shoulder and escort him from the stand. \n\nBob sat down on the bench next to me and the lead detective. He gave a big thumbs up along with a wide grin. \"THAT WENT WELL!\" He yelled, the level of volume of his voice juxtaposing the depleted level of his hearing aid batteries. \n\nI glanced back at the judge. He was squinting his eyes in disbelief and seemed to give a somewhat exasperated chuckle. \n\n\"Next witness for the state?\" He asked the prosecutor, replacing his glasses. \n\nThe prosecutor stood. \"Officer EMR.\"\n\nI stood and had to step around Bob to make my way to the aisle. \n\n\"GOOD LUCK! THAT ATTORNEY'S TOUGH.\" Maybe his voice just sounded so loud because everyone else was still in a semi-silent state of shock from his testimony. \n\nI fought a smile as I made my way up to the witness stand. Thanks to its brevity, my testimony was well received from all those involved in the trial that day. Every once and a while I'd cast my gaze over to Bob, sitting grumpily in the audience and trying to figure out why his hearing aid wasn't working. ",

At this point, I’m a little suspicious, but foolish me thinks, “were following the route, we should be fine”.  The ironic part is that the first time around, we missed the turn, so we doubled back and turned on to the road.  As we keep approaching, the road is flanked by relatively high concrete barriers topped with barbed wire.  At this point, I am really suspicious/nervous.\n\nWe roll up to a checkpoint.  The gate guards give their spiel and run a dog around the car.  We’re not that kind of people, so we come up clean.  One of the officers tells us we’re technically trespassing, but he believes our museum story.  We wait while he runs our info, and we come up clean, and one of the officers offers to escort us to our destination (I guess to verify our story).\n\nMoral of the story – check your route before you take it!\n\nEDIT: Surprisingly, I wasn't searched.

I didn't mind, I actually liked the policy.  It kept the kids safe.  However, my house was surrounded by these school zones.

Fantastic.\n\nI pull over as far as I can, glad that this is a two lane boulevard with plenty of space in each lane and an allowance for parking on the side.  I roll down the window and put my hands back on the wheel.  I'm just prepping to cooperate as fast as I can to keep from being too late.  The officer steps up to my window and asks me for my ID and insurance. \n\nI comply and he asks, \"Where you headed?\"\n\n\"Divorce court.\"  I reply quickly, glancing to the summons for said hearing sitting on my arm rest. \n\nThe officer busts out laughing.  Like slapping his knee bending over and everything.  Something about how I had said it, or perhaps how matter of fact I was had set him off laughing.  It took him a minute to collect himself and he hands me back my id and insurance.  \n\n\"Look, you weren't out of the school zone when you sped up back there.  I'm going to let you go, you've got enough on your plate today.  Watch your speed next time.\"  He says wiping tears from his eyes.\n\nI look up at him surprised, but certainly thankful.  I told him I'd watch it next time and watched him as he walked back to his cruiser still laughing.",

        "text": "I thumped the last box from my move onto my new desk. Around me, detectives in their various sections buzzed about, busy with minor tragedies and muttering about commanders making bad decisions. It was definitely a different environment than patrol. Our headquarters building, where the criminal investigations section was located, was a decrepit leftover from the 1970’s with the lingering décor to prove it. Burnt oranges and chocolaty browns stubbornly clung to the tall walls and ceilings in the vaulted entry-way. The rickety elevators that reluctantly dragged you up the dozen or so stories to your chosen floor groaned and creaked like doors in a haunted house movie. But despite the lack of quality abode, the biggest and most immediate difference to me was the availability of and eagerness to dole out work supplies. \n\nOn the street, it was the routine to scrape, steal, and beg for anything resembling functional equipment. In investigations, I had a thick office supply catalog waiting me with a neon-colored note from the section secretary telling me to “pick out whatever I wanted :).” My desk also came adorned with a still-in-the box digital recorder, expensive looking password-protected thumb drive, laptop bag with the department seal on it (and a note from our IT guy “Laptops might be coming soon, I’m serious.”), more calendars than I knew what to do with, a Xerox paper box full of the basic desk supplies, and a polo with “MAJOR CRIMES” under my department's badge – my new uniform. I had hit the big time, though be it the lowest rung, and it felt good. \n\nI had just placed the headset back onto the overly complicated phone system when it screamed its too-loud ring at me. For a moment I was concerned I had somehow screwed up the process of setting up my voicemail account and hoped I wouldn’t have to put up with the monotone electronic female voice that guided mew through the difficult task of setting up a personal voicemail greeting. \n\nI picked up the phone. “Hello?” I was still unsure how a detective was supposed to answer the phone. \n\n“EMR! It’s Mike. How’re things? Settling in I hope?” The voice was chipper and I recognized it immediately.\n\n“Oh, hey, yeah, hi Lt. I’m doing well. Just deciding if I want white or red three ring binders out of the supply catalog.” I fanned through several pages of filing cabinets and binder clips.\n\n“Navy blue; it looks the most official.” Of course he was right. Navy blue was the best choice. “I’m not calling about office supplies though. You busy? Can you respond to a call out?”\n\nI caught the urge to “WHOOP” mid-throat and took a moment to compose myself before saying “Yes, of course. Where and when and I’ll be there.” My first day and already office work was getting to me. \n\n“Your old stomping grounds: the barrio. Go to Thomas Street and meet with patrol. They’re out with a recovered stolen car and a witness came forward with suspect info. Welcome to property crimes!” The last part was a dig at my assignment. Of all the sections in investigations, property crimes was the least respected and one of only a few sections where new people usually cut their teeth. I was happy to be there though, and also happy I’d get my first case in a comfortable environment. \n\nI quickly packed up and made my way across town to the barrio. I saw the cruiser idling on Thomas St and pulled up behind him. Pedro stepped out when he noticed my unmarked. \n\n“Aww shit! Look who it is! Looking spiffy Mr. Polo Shirt. Slumming it back here with us peons? How are things up there in the ivory tower?” He shook my hand and had a broad smile on his face\n\n“Ah, it’s not so bad so far; just been getting settled really. This’ll be my first case.” I looked around to see if anyone else was going to assist but quickly realized I was the only backup deemed necessary to investigate this caper. \n\n“Well, you can have it, man. This stolen car crap is for the birds.” Pedro thumbed his finger at an old Honda parked in front of his cruiser. “Just running tags and I got the hit. Spaces aren’t assigned so I was just going to recover it. Juan over there came walking over to “help out” when he noticed me looking into it. Said he knows who has been driving it.”\n\nI looked to Juan, an elderly homeless guy who was smiling at me from his perch on a nearby storm drain. “Is he drunk?”\n\n“Oh, probably. I shooed him away from a forty-ouncer earlier, but I bet he found another somewhere.” Pedro smiled coyly as he looked at me, realizing what a mess he was serving up. \n\n“Juan!” I called to the swaying man, “Como estas!” \n\nJuan ambled over to me and stuck out a calloused yet clammy hand for a greeting. I obliged and tried to discreetly wipe his sweat from my palm immediately after. “So, what did you see?”\n\n“Oh, that car? The boy drives it. Lives in that house.” He pointed a bobbing index finger at one of the row-houses nearby. “I saw him park it this morning!” Juan was obviously proud of himself and also obviously too drunk to remember the barrio standard operating procedure of not cooperating with the police out in the open. \n\n“What’d he look like?”\n\n“Well… he was young. Wearing jeans. White t-shirt. Short hair – black. No mustache or beard… looked like a pandillero.” \n\n“A gang member? Like MS13?” I knew MS had a presence on the block and the thought I might be able to infiltrate them on my first case was exciting. \n\n“Si. Like la Mara.” Juan suddenly realized the line he had crossed and noticeably sobered up. “You’re not going to tell him I helped, will you?”\n\n“Of course not. If I can find him, you’re cooperation won’t be needed to prosecute him. Thanks for the information though.” Juan nodded but was no longer smiling. I was happy to notice he didn’t try to shake in farewell; rather he turned quickly and shuffled away, glancing back at the row house every few steps. \n\n“Want to go rustle up some gang bangers?” I asked Pedro. \n\nHe shrugged. “Sure, what else am I doing?”\n\nWe approached the house and I knocked. A moment later the door cracked open and a scratchy voice called out, “Quien?”\n\n“Police. Can I talk for a minute?” I held out my shiny new detective badge while balancing my legal pad in the other hand. \n\nThe door swung open and a guy who could have been Juan’s brother stood in the entry. “Can I help you officers?”\n\nUsually, being greeted with such courtliness meant someone had something to hide. “Can we come in? I have a couple questions about a car out here.”\n\n“Please, please, come in!” He ushered us in and we were greeted by an equally enthusiastic stench of body odor and cologne. “Have a seat.” He motioned to a moldy looking couch.\n\n“I’m good, thanks,” I chuckled, keeping it light, “I’m sitting at a desk all day these days!”\n\nPedro rolled his eyes at my comment but made no move to sit either. \n\n“So, do you know who’s driving that Honda parked out front?” No need to beat around the bush.\n\nThe man peered out the window to the side of the door. “That Honda?” He asked, seemingly confounded by my question. “No, no idea. I’ve never seen that car in my life.” He made exaggerated facial expressions attempting to convey his utter ignorance on anything to do with the vehicle in question but only making my wonder what he was hiding.\n\n“Well, who else lives here? Anyone here right now?”\n\n“Let me see.” He said, and stepped around me. “Fellas! You here?!?!” He yelled through cupped hands.\n\nI grimaced from the decibel level he had just employed, but heard shuffling from the back of the house. I peered around the corner and saw three young men walking down the hall, answering the call to order from the obvious house boss. \n\n“Here are the guys who live here.” The old man presented us his charges, all in their 20’s, all wearing jeans and white shirts, and, by appearance alone, all potentially gang members. \n\n“Guys, how are you?” I started. They mumbled near inaudible replies. \n\n“Whose car is that Honda out there?” I asked. I knew I had little to go on so I wasn’t going to waste everyone’s time. \n\nNot one even looked at the car, nor did anyone jump to claim ownership. \n\n“Ok. Well, you can go have a seat,” I pointed to one who had a long mustache and goatee, obviously not the guy Juan had described, “But you two, I have some questions. You have ID?”\n\n“No, no.” they both mumbled in unison. I was getting nowhere.\n\n“Well, what’s your name?” I asked the closest. \n\n“Jose.” He replied, barely looking up.\n\n“Jose…?” I paused, implying ‘I know you have a last name so what is it smart guy?’\n\n“…Ventura… Benevides De La Paz Corranza.” Two, maybe three last names was common among the Central American population and it was always a trial getting it out of them. Four was over the top. \n\n“Wow, ok. And you?” I turned to the other.\n\n“Jose.” He replied.\n\n“Jeez… Jose…?” I wrongly assumed he should have picked up on his partner’s routine.\n\n“Ventura.” He said.\n\n“Really? Two Jose Ventura’s?” I looked from the old man to Pedro, both shrugging in reply to my questioning glare.\n\n“Do you own this place?” I asked the old man. \n\n“Oh, no. El Don rents this place. I just collect the rent from these guys while I stay here.” He answered as though it should have been obvious.\n\n“Ok. Can I talk to ‘El Don’?” I was getting a little tired of the quickly developing Abbott and Costello routine. The old man pulled out a crusty looking flip phone and held down a key, speed-dialing El Don. He then passed it to me, still ringing.\n\nA raspy voice answered the other end. “Digame!”\n\n“Is this… Don?” I tried first in English, hopeful to get things rolling in my native language. \n\n“Yes, yes. I am el Don. What is the problem, who is this?” He was annoyed, that much was clear, but I carried on.\n\n“This is detective EMR,” Damn it was still strange to call myself detective, “and I’m here at your house in the barrio. I have a couple questions about a stolen car that was recovered in front of your house.”\n\n“Stolen car, eh? It had to be Jose.” Well, that was easier than I could have hoped for.\n\n“Jose? Which one?” A few more clarifying questions and I could get into the meat of this case.\n\n“”Uhhh… Jose Ventura.” I should have seen that pitfall coming. \n\n“Oh, of course. But Jose Ventura with the other names? Or Jose Ventura with just Ventura?” I glanced up at the two guys still standing in front of me, trying to read any sign of guilt on their faces. \n\n“Jose Ventura… I think his other last name is Maravida? I don’t know these people. They just pay rent.” \n\nNow speaking away from the phone and to the two Joses – “Which one of you is Jose Ventura Maravida?” They just shook their heads in confusion at my question. I turned my attention back to El Don.  “Could you be thinking of Benevides? Not Maravida?”\n\n“No, no. I don’t know. He’s Guatemalan, short, black hair, lives in the basement.” El Don was about to hang up on me, I could feel it.\n\n“Oh, ok. I’ll work with that. Thanks Don.” He replied with the click of the phone being disconnected and I handed the old man back his phone. \n\n“Who lives in the basement?” Neither would answer so I looked to the old man. \n\nHe shrugged again. “I think they switch a lot. I don’t know who’s down there now.”\n\n“Well, can I go take a look?” The old man shrugged once again. I was beginning to wonder if that was his only non-verbal reply. \n\n“So is that a yes?” The old man looked to the two Joses, then back to me. \n\n“Ok. Sure.” He shrugged his shoulders in obvious bewilderment. \n\n“C’mon.” I called to Pedro, and we made our way into the kitchen and down the narrow staircase leading to the mildewy-smelling basement. When we were out of earshot, I turned to address Pedro again. “Did you get any vibes? It’s one of the Joses, at least that’s what Don told me. Neither looked guilty or anything though, just uncomfortable having a cop in their business.”\n\n“Nah, I didn’t notice anything either. That old dude knows what’s up though. He’s a dick.” Pedro began poking around the scant few personal items lying on the thread-bare bed. “What’re we looking for?”\n\n“Anything that’ll tell us which Jose is living down here. Hopefully we don’t dig up any more last names.” I flipped though some paper-work but nothing had any information that would differentiate which Jose was the owner. After several minutes of unsuccessful searching I was about to give up. \n\n“Ooooh, nasty!” Pedro was over by the TV and had ejected the DVD from the player propped up on top of the ancient boob-tube. I peered over his shoulder to see what had elicited the response. \n\n“Debbie Does Doggie?” I read the title out loud for some reason, maybe due to the shock of the photo stuck onto the disc depicting a nude, overweight, mess of a woman squatting with her legs spread, smiling at the camera, and grasping the “red-rocket” of what appeared to be a golden retriever. I gagged a little. \n\nPedro was caught in a fit of childish giggles when he turned to me. “No balls if you don’t call them out on this.” The devilish twinkle in his eye confirmed he knew my weakness for accepting childish dares, but his sophomoric suggestion did spark a thought. \n\n“Ha. Watch this.” I grabbed the DVD from the player and stomped upstairs and into the living room. The Joses and the old man had joined the mustachioed stranger there and I held up the disc as accusatorily as possible. Pedro filed in behind the group to watch the show.\n\n“Who owns this DVD?” I asked, trying to sound angry. \n\nNo one answered me, and more than a couple of them looked confused as to why I was so upset about a DVD. \n\n“Long Jose? Is it yours? How ‘bout you, short Jose? Huh? You all do know it’s illegal to have this, right?” I was bluffing, unsure what the laws concerning bestiality pornography were in my state – I guess I never needed to look them up before.\n\nMy gamble came through for me and there was a DVD played in the entertainment center. I popped the disc in, turned on the TV and waited. There was next to no production value (I was astonished!) and the DVD immediately jumped into the action. The same chubby woman who was depicted on the disc sauntered into a room, nude except for a pair of slutty high-heels. She strolled over to the golden retriever and began petting its head… seductively?... as stereotypical porno music pumped through the TV’s speakers. The dog had socks on its front paws and seemed eager to please the woman. \n\n(***Author’s note*** – if the sock thing seems like a strange detail, clearly you haven’t been exposed to the depravity needed to hypothesize why this might be a useful accessory in cross-species coitus.)\n\nI sensed the DVD was about to progress beyond a point I wanted to witness so I turned to the group. Most were uncomfortably watching the screen, unsure what was about to happen but intrigued nonetheless. I could read on their faces when the action took a turn for the worse. Pedro looked as though he was about to puke and he ducked back into the hallway, giggling like a schoolgirl. The old man looked from the screen to his roommates, disgusted that one of them was derelict enough to bring such material into the house. Mustache-man just stared at the carpet, a sad frown on his face. Short Jose was half laughing, half staring at the ceiling, trying not to make eye contact with me or anyone else. \n\nLong Jose was different. He stared at the screen, blank faced and unfazed by the terrible images flashing on it. \n\n“Jose Ventura Benvid-whatever. You!” I pointed to him, shaking him from his fetish. “Stand up! Let’s talk.”\n\nWe walked to the kitchen (after I turned off the TV) and I asked if I could pat him down. He agreed and I did, finding something In his pocket that I should have thought of earlier. \n\n“BWWAAAAAAAHAHAHA!” Pedro erupted in laughter when I extracted the item – a key fob with a remote and key for, presumably, the stolen Honda outside.\n\n“Crap.” I said. \n\n“Guess you should’ve thought of that one before, huh *detective*?” Pedro was wiping tears from his eyes and I was coming to terms with the fact I needed to work on my investigative skills. \n\nThe auto-thieving Jose Ventura came off the story – he admitted he stole the car from a day labor sight up the road. After putting on the cuffs and walking him out to Pedro’s cruiser, I turned to bid farewell to the old man and the other Jose, the two of them having followed me out of the house. \n\n“Well, thanks for the help!” I told the old man. \n\n“What should I do with this?” He was holding the offending DVD like it was infected with some disease (maybe it was). \n\n“Burn it?” I suggested, shrugging my shoulders in a gesture I knew he’d understand.\n",

This is very normal where I come from. We both came up behind a person who was doing 10 under the limit. 3 cars were coming from the opposite direction so we both waited until they passed us. As soon as we cleared them the person accelerated and passed the slow poke. I did the same thing. Only when I checked my rear view mirror I saw red and blue lights. Oh shit! I was out of state so  chances were good that I was going to get a ticket. I also had my shotgun in the trunk because I was shooting skeet while I was visiting. I kept it a trigger lock on there and the ammo in the cab with me. I pulled over onto the shoulder and got all the way off the road. When I looked back I saw the last thing I wanted to see on the door of the car. Oklahoma Highway Patrol. FUCK! Now I was guaranteed a ticket! I rolled down my window and placed both hands on the wheel. \"Hello, I'm Trooper Blank with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Do you know why I pulled you over?\" \"No sir, but I do want to tell you that I have shotgun in my trunk. It is locked and unloaded.\" I said gripping the wheel trying to stop my arms from shaking. \"Well the reason I pulled you over is because when you passed that red sedan you were going 15 over the speed limit.\" He said looking around in my car. Damn it, well there goes my bonus. \n\n\"Why don't you step out and come sit in my car?\" He said as he stepped back from my car to let me out. I grabbed my insurance and got out. I passed him that and my licence. He looked it over and asked \"What brings you all the way out to BFE?\" \"I was visiting my mom and step-dad sir.\" \"What are their names?\" I told him. We both got into the front of his car and he asked me \"Did they work at [rehab center]?\" \"Yes sir\" \"I know them!\" he said with a huge smile on their face. We began talking about how they knew each other from patients my parents treated. After 5 minutes of us talking to each other he said \"I'm going to give you a warning. Only if you promise not to speed until you get across the border.\" Yes sir I will.\" I went back to my car and did 5 m.p.h. under until I got back across the border.",

        "text": "**Couldn't proofread the title, could I? That should be [Suspect]. Apologies.**\n\nA silly little story I shared with the IRC P&amp;S crowd a few weeks ago.\n\nThe guy I am currently seeing moved up to northern Vermont about a month ago. The one hour commute we used to have to see each other is now 5 hours. Long distance sucks but we're going to try it. Plus, I love traveling.\n\nAfter moving him and all his stuff, I headed back home to Cape Cod. I get antsy after about 3 hours. Around 4 hours, I get jittery and start talking to myself. I just hate being cooped up in a car. So some place around the Massachusetts border, I just lose it. Other drivers are driving me nuts, I am sick of construction cones, Slow Down signs, and uneven pavement. Fuck this, it's time for some French Fries! \n\nAfter grabbing a large fry and small  Sprite from a McDonald's off some exit, I make my way back towards the Land of Endless Grooved Lanes. I am piling French Fries into my mouth as I drive. I have to stop at a red light but who cares!? More time for French Fries! I am so giddy while consuming my favorite snack, I am bouncing in my seat and singing with the crappy pop song on the radio. I hate pop music but who cares!? I have French Fries!\n\nAs I bring up another fistful of French Fries to my mouth, I feel it. That feeling I know too well and hate so much. Someone is staring at me. I look to my right and there he is: Mister Townie Patrol Officer. First car in the line. Staring me down.\n\nThe second I see him, I stop bouncing in my seat, my hand clenching the French Fries freezes at my mouth. My mind begins to whirl with irrational paranoia. *Why is he staring at me? I know eating is considered distracted driving? Is he ready to pull me over?* His stare continues as each car with the green arrow continues to pass between us.\n\nWithout really thinking, I wave my French Fries at him. I don't smile, I think my mouth stayed frozen in the Ready to Eat French Fries position. *Wait, why is he leaning forward?  Is that where his lights and siren are? Crap, is this really going to be my first ticket? Is he calling in for back up? Is this it?? Is this The End of The Line???*\n\nHe leans back in his seat, brings up his hand, and waves his own golden delicious French Fries back at me. \n\nMy light turned green as he did this but I attempted a wave as I passed through, shoving the handful of French Fries into my mouth. We waved our French Fries at each other, a sort of secret salute so few have the honor to engage in.  No words need to be spoken. We understand each other.\n\n*After rereading this and making sure I crossed my I's and dotted my T's, I can't help but wonder what went through his head during this exchange.*",

We went with a friend who worked at the cemetary ([where that famous tombstone is located](http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_gravestone3.htm)) next to the park and who would have us go through the cemetary, as it was a convenient shortcut. Alas, the cemetary was closed to all, no exceptions.\n\nSo we resigned ourselves to walk the extra mile or two to go to the park...\n\nWe were about 9 people, 3 adults &amp; 6 kids, from 6 to 14.\n\nSo we walk along the boulevard, when a blue and white Dodge Fury with a \"cherry\" on top stops, and shouts at our friend.\n\n-- You going to the show?

Just come aboard!!!\n\nSo we all crammed ourselves, 3 kids on the front and the rest of the people on the back seat (thank god cars were huge back then), and we were graciously brought to the top of the mountain by police cruiser, soon enough to get ourselves a very good spot to see the stage...\n\nEDIT: Changed \"Dodge\" to \"Plymouth\", and added this picture: https://i.imgur.com/nZdIREF.jpg",

        "text": "**Tales from the Academy- A collection of short stories from my time thus far in the Academy.**\n\n\nSince the stories will be shorter in length I figured I would just put them all in one post. Note: I am still attending the Academy with just a few months left. These stories come from various training exercises, community service events, etc. that I have taken part in. The Academy I attend is through a college, meaning we don’t live at the Academy or get paid to go by an agency. \nI hope you enjoy! \n\n\n**First Ride Along**\n\n\nWhen I first entered the Academy, I had the privilege to go on a ride along with the local Sheriff’s Department. It was the midnight shift.  We started out by making a stop at the local QT since they give free drinks to officers. After getting the necessary refreshments, we went on patrol. \n\nOur first call was a domestic disturbance between a girlfriend and boyfriend. On the way to the scene, we encountered a black car driving slow, as if lost. Deputy pulled up next to the car and asked where the driver was heading. She just simply stated that she was heading home. \n\nBeing in a rush to get to the domestic disturbance, we did not take notice of her odd behavior-answer combination. Once on scene, we quickly discovered that the boyfriend had taken off.  Deputy interviewed the girlfriend while I observed. Then suddenly a black car went racing down the street adjacent to us. Deputy and I get in the cruiser to give chase but it became quickly apparent that we were not going to find the car due to the number of turns and the head start. Deputy finished up with the girlfriend and we resumed our patrol.\n\n\nOur next destination was a very shady part of town. Deputy parked by a cheap apartment complex and we walked through. He chatted with a few residents who were on their stoops, just doing some basic intelligence gathering. His radio alerted him to a shots fired call in the nearby town. We race back to the car and run lights/sirens all the way there. On the way he briefs me on what he expects of me. I am to stay in the car and if it hits the fan, there is a shotgun in the trunk. On arrival, Deputy and the assist cars cannot find the shooter(s), or any evidence of any shots being fired.\n\n\nThe rest of the shift was spent talking with his zone partner and patrolling around.\n\n**Being the Bad Guy**\n\n\nThe Academy I attend runs two or three classes at a time. The “senior” class was doing practicals, which is where they do a day of mock traffic stops, mock calls for service, and mock building searches. My class got the opportunity to help with these practicals by being role-players (aka the bad guys).\nThis practical day was the last one before the class graduated so they were rolling with the mock handguns with rubber ammunition. \n\nThe role players were told to resist at various levels and to pretty much be as much of a nuisance as possible. I started out by being a bad guy for the building clearing scenarios. I was unarmed but was able to resist as much as I felt comfortable as long as I wasn’t causing actual harm. Several groups went through and did fine with my passive resistance. Then I decided to up the stress. \n\nI turned off the lights for the room I was in and I put my hand in my back pocket, gripping my wallet. When the group made entry, I was hidden well-enough to avoid discovery until they reached the end of the room. Upon being seen, I quickly pulled my hand from my back pocket, wallet in hand, and raised both hands up. Upon my quick motions, the group of two opened up with a volley of shots. Upon discovering my hand to hold a wallet, only one comment was uttered, “Oh Sh*t”. \n\n\nAfter that, I decided to switch over to the mock traffic stops. Here I would play the passenger of a car being stopped by a police cruiser containing two recruits. An instructor would tell us what the scenario would be. A couple scenarios, I would bolt from the car right as we stopped. Others, the driver would resist arrest and I would just calmly walk away from the scene. On one scenario, I was told to be the most cooperative person in the world unless/until I had a hand placed on me. This is how it went: \n\n\nWe were pulled over by the recruits. Note: The driver in this scenario is a large, stocky man whose nickname is “Juggernaut”. Then the driver and I argued and began shoving each other, I hit him (gently in the shoulder) a few times for good measure. The recruits told us to stop arguing and I went into my act as “World’s Best Citizen”. They ran the driver and he had a warrant for his arrest and I didn’t have any ID. One recruit got Juggernaut out of the car and the other asked me to step out. Juggernaut bolts for it, as fast as he could manage. \n\n\nThe recruit on my side of the car couldn’t see this because of his attentions being on me. He told me he was going to frisk me for his safety and then put a hand on my wrist. The fight was on. He pinned me up against the hood of the car but I countered by putting my foot behind his and knocked him onto his back, with me on top of him. I wrestled with him and kept him under me while his partner began chasing Juggernaut. I had made up my mind to keep wrestling on the ground with him until his partner arrived. It took his partner a good five minutes to realize that there wasn’t anyone visible on the passenger side of the car, since he had started to go for Juggernaut. He quickly rushed over and assisted his partner in arresting me. Juggernaut got away. \n\n\n**Spray Day**\n\n\nTo use OC Spray (aka CS or Pepper Spray), one must be exposed to it. This is done so the user knows what he is using and so the user knows how to cure it. This is usually done while in the Academy, and we were no exception.\n\n\nWe started Spray Day with a class on the history, facts, techniques, etc. of OC Spray. Then we practiced spray techniques with inert training spray.\n\nFinally, it was time for us to get hit with OC. We went one at a time. The Officer who sprayed us first gave us a one on one “pep talk” that was based in the survival mentality. He talked about our families and what would happen if we ever gave up and stopped fighting. Then he backed up and sprayed a stream across our forehead and eyes. The burn was unimaginable. \n\nMy eyes shut immediately. Picture the worst burning sensation imaginable and then multiply that sensation by about 1000. I had to stand there for ten seconds while having to hold my eyes open. Then I ran over to a person holding a bag. Ten strikes were delivered and on to the next station. I had to find a training baton lying on the ground and give ten strikes to another person with a bag. After successfully completing that, I had to find a person holding a pair of cuffs in the air and then I had to prone out a subject and arrest them. Finally, I had to provide a description of a subject over the radio.\n\n\nAll that was the easy part. From there I washed my face well with water and stood over a fan. That is where the real burn kicked in. I couldn’t stand in the cool breeze of the fan for very long and had to keep taking “breaks” from it because while I was standing in the fan I could not breathe. Once out of the fan, however, the burn would come back immediately. This continued for about half an hour. The burn subsided to a bearable level, though still intense. The burn lasted on my face, arms, and legs for a couple of hours. My hands cooled to space-heater level and remained there for a few days.\n\n\n**Helping with the parade**\n\n\nThe local police department asked if we would help them with a local parade. Each recruit was assigned to an officer and was to help control traffic. Officer and I went to our assigned intersection and had a fairly easy job of traffic control since the parade spectators blocked off the entrances to the parade route pretty well. I had to occasionally back people up when they got too close to the route but was always met with high fives and the like.\n\nAfter the parade went through, Officer and I climbed into his cruiser and followed the rear of the parade, forming a rolling wall of patrol cars behind the parade. This was done to keep traffic from catching up to the back of the parade. We then were sent to direct traffic from the end of the parade route and the main instruction in crossed. Our mission was to get the traffic out of the local park as quickly as possible but also try and prevent too much backlog of traffic from building up on the main road. \n\n\nWe easily accomplished this goal but had a few people try and turn into the park. I directed them onward per my instructions. There was a middle-aged woman standing on the sidewalk close by waiting to cross the street. Every time I waved a car on or told them that they couldn't turn here she would bicker and yell at me using phrases like “Stop being rude” and “You are so mean”.\n \nThis continued for about half an hour. Note that I was not being rude or mean, just simply telling people to keep driving and to not block the flow of traffic. \n\nFinally, Officer came over to help on my side of the street and the woman stopped her yelling and asked him when she could cross. He told her he wasn't sure and that set her off again. He nipped it in the rear, however, by telling her that the longer she kept running her mouth, the longer she would have to wait. That caused her to quiet down. \n\n\n**END**\n\n\nAbove are a few of the stories I have from the Academy so far. I cannot think of any others yet and the more exciting parts of the Academy are coming up. We have driver training, night fire, field sobriety training, and our own practicals in the next few months. I also have some ride alongs coming up that I will be sure to pass along if they prove eventful.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed!\n",

        "text": "This happened back when I was a teenager, and driving an old, beat-to-hell Wrangler with too many lights to be legal, and a plow pump hanging off of the front bumper. I was that guy.\n\n\nI was headed to a body shop in town when I came across a stranded trucker who was running bobtail. I pulled up as he was directing traffic around the stalled rig, and he told me he was out of gas. I said there was a station about a mile down the road, and I'd get some fuel for him if he'd pay me back. He agreed.\n\n\nI went to the station, and tried to bum a gas can off of the owner. No luck. Fine, I'll just buy one and ask the trucker to pay me back. $55 later, I toss the full 6 gallon container in the back of my Jeep.\n\n\nI get back to the trucker, and a cop with a brand new Charger is sitting there, lights flashing. I pull up behind him, and the cop comes over to my window. \n\n\n\"So you're the one who's helping these folks out?\" he said, pointing to the woman and two kids who had apparently been in the truck before while I had been talking to the trucker. \n\n\n\"Yes sir,\" I replied. \n\n\n\"We'll thats hugely gererous of you,\" he said with a genuine smile as he reached over and shook my hand. \n\n\n\"It's the least I could do sir; I just got a new job,\" I said with a laugh, going around back of my Jeep, and opening the hatch. It was open before I remembered why I was headed to the body shop that day. \n\n\nThe keg. \n\n\nBut not any keg. It was a keg that my older friend had gone and cut holes in so he could have threaded inserts welded in, at the body shop. Which may or may not been so that he could make a still for personal use. But he was too busy being a paramedic and saving lives and all that crap, so he asked me to do it. \n\n\nYeah. \n\n\n\"Oh really? Where are you wo-,\" he began to say, stopping mid-sentence when he saw the large cylinder, tied down with a bright orange tow strap.   The beaming \"wow-what-a-nice-young-man\" smile suddenly left his face. I'm freaking out at this point. Hell, I've never even talked to an on duty cop before today. \n\n \n\"Oh...I uh... I work over at...uh ABC Inc.\"\n\n\nExcept I didnt say \"ABC\". I said the actual name of the company. That was right down the road. Oh, I was sweating bullets as I fumbled with the rope holding down the gas can. \n\n\n\"I see,\" he said. He started walking towards his cruiser, shoulders slightly hunched, head pointed down a bit. In hindsight, I think I really bummed him out. I think in that moment, he just wanted to enjoy seeing humanity not being shitty, and I went and ruined it for him because now he's got a teenager with a keg in the back of their Jeep. \n\n\nBut I wasn't thinking about that. No, I was full on, \"the snozberries taste like snozberries\" freaking out. I practically ran those 6 gallons past the officer, who was now typing on his laptop, and to the trucker. \n\n\n\"Man, thank you so much,\" he said. \"How much do I o-\"\n\n\n\"It's on me, have a good one!\" I interrupted, pushing the diesel into one hand and shaking the other before turning around and power walking my way back to the Jeep. The cop was still looking at his laptop as I walked by. \n\n\n\"Have a nice day, Officer!\" I said a little too quickly. \n\n\n\"Take care, Cadd,\" he replied. I damn near tripped over my own feet. \n\n\nI went straight to my friend's house, dropped the stainless steel abomination on his back porch, and wrote a quick note: \n\n\n\"They were closed.\" \n\n\nAnd even after all that, he never made that damn still.",

        "text": "I previously wrote about my first run-in with the police in my podunk little hometown [Here's the whole story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2fyeze/suspect_why_dont_we_talk_to_him_before_you_decide/)  This takes place the following Friday night.\n\nThings were okay after that little screwup.  I got away with getting loaded underage with one lawn mowing I would've had to do anyway, but my parents each had a nice waxed and hand buffed vehicle by Saturday evening.  Gotta pay your dues, but I had no problem with it. Busted is busted, even if it happens because you got screwed over by someone else.\n\nOn Monday, I started my summer job.  I was riding in a garbage truck for the parks department of my hometown.  It sucked. Hot, loud, smelly, and my partner was a lifer who had been working for the town for 20+ years.  What a miserable prick this guy was.  Played nothing on the radio but American right-wing talk radio. Do you know how much it sucked being an 18 year old Deadhead and having to listen to Rush Limbaugh &amp; Dr Laura all day?\n\nAnyway, Friday finally came around. Party at Johnny's house, as his Mom was out until the next day \"visiting a friend\" (Not in those heels, (Johnny's Mom).  Cougar was hunting, and looking good.  She's definitely not coming home tonight)  Anyway, Johnny and another buddy got jobs waiting tables at the Country club, and got their tips cashed out nightly.  So by Friday, they had lots of cash for a decent party.  One phone call to a few people who could supply us with liquor, and we were ready to have a party.  News travels fast in a small town, so by the time I showed up, it was blasting.  A lot of the waitresses from the country club showed, and brought friends.  Great party.\n\nFor everyone else.  I couldn't hook up with a fucking tow truck.  No luck whatsoever.  This \"nice guy\" shit wears mighty thin when chicks dig jerks.  So, I leave after getting wasted in dateless misery.\n\nI start walking home. Wobbling my way home, drunk and pissed.  In my tiny-ass hometown.  On the same route as last week.  At about the same time.  On Friday.  Who do you think I run into?\n\nLights, cherries, flashlights, etc.  Hear footsteps and doors slamming.\n\n\"Hold up, son, you wanna talk for a second?\" (*Why does that voice sound familiar?*)\n\n\"Turn around and keep your hands where we can see them!\" (*Now I know that voice! You gotta be fucking kidding me!\" That asshole again?)\n\nIt's Cop #1 and Cop #2 (AKA Constable Peachfuzz) from last week.  Don't these guys ever change shifts?  I vaguely remember that Cop #1 wasn't so bad last week, but I was drunk, and a little pissed off; from both an evening of striking out, and the fact that in my drunken brain, I got fucked over by the police last week.\n\nCop #1: Oh jeez, you again?\n\nCop #2: You got off light last week, jackass.  Think we're gonna run you in tonight.\n\nMe:  Doncha (hic) also remember that He's the one making decisions, rook?  Are do you (hic) have to wait for him to tell you to be quiet again? (burp)\n\nCop #1 shakes a bit like he's trying not to giggle.  He looks a little pissed because he found me drunk again, but I can tell I have a little leeway here by the fact that he didn't tell me to shut up.\n\nCop #2: yeah well I think..\n\nCop #1: You're not allowed to think unless I tell you to.  I think he remembers what you did to him last week.  I know I do.\n\nCop #2 gives him a weird little \"oh shit\" look.  I think he got his ass reamed after the loudspeaker incident.  Cop #1 lets it go, and looks at me.\n\nCop #1: Now, I thought I said that I didn't want to see you walking home drunk again.\n\nMe: Yeah? I also thought you said we were cool, and you were just gonna (hic) gonna drop me off and let me take my chances going in.  This asshole (gesturing at Cop #2) getting on the fuckin' loudspeaker kinda stacks the deck, doncha think?\n\nCop #2: listen you little...\n\nCop #1: Shut up (Constable Peachfuzz).  You had that coming.  (To me) Sorry about that kid. (*Did a police officer just apologize to me?*)  It's been dealt with. You wanna simmer down?\n\nMe: (*realizing he's trying to be fair, and I'm being a jackass again*) Yes sir.\n\nCop #2: Oh, it's back to sir now?\n\nCop #1 gives him this look that practically screams \"will you please just shut the fuck up?\"  Even I notice it, and my mouth drops open a bit.  How ever he didn't notice it I don't know.  I'm drunk off my ass, and I saw it.  Fuck it. I'm drunk and he's an asshole. Gloves are coming off.  Verbally, that is.\n\nMe: (taking another ill-advised verbal jab) To him it is.\n\nCop #2 shakes his head at me and reaches for his belt.  I hear a button snap, and Cop #1 actually turns his back to me and puts his hand on Cop #2's chest.\n\nCop#1: I don't know what the fuck you think you were about to do, but I don't like it.  You were an asshole to this kid last week, and you're being an asshole now.  I think I'm starting to see a pattern.  Button back up, and shut the fuck up, and back the fuck up. (*HOLY SHIT!*)\n\nHe turns around, and gives me a once over.  Cop #2 is glaring at me.  Angry.  He's the one being an asshole, and he blames me.  Cop #1 continues his evaluation of me.  He's now unsure of what to think of me.  It's a very long silence to a drunk teenager.\n\nCop #1: You okay, son?\n\nMe: (burp) Starting to wobble a bit.\n\nCop #1: Why don't you lean against the car and get your sea legs?\n\nMe: Ok.  (hic) Can I say something?\n\nCop #1: Go ahead.\n\nMe: Sir, last week you were a good guy.  You coulda picked me up at first glance.  But you didn't. (hic) Thanks. I respect that, and hope there's more cops like you. (hic) But that guy (gesturing to cop #2) well, you said it pretty good.\n\nCop #1 doesn't say anything.  He gives me a \"yeah, I know look\", but there's something else there.  Sorrow. Like he knows that my hometown is full of shit cops and it's getting worse.  I am a wobbling, belching, drunk teenager, and he'd rather talk to me than the guy he rides with.  Cop #2 is a few feet behind him, but is still seething.  He's like a dog who doesn't know who to growl at.\n\nI'm starting to not feel so good.  Maybe I can talk my way home, but I definitely don't want to go home in the back of a cruiser again.\n\nCop #1: (sighs) Thanks kid.  Think you can make it home all right?\n\nCop #2: So that it? This little idiot sweet talks you for ten seconds and you're gonna let him go?  He's underage, it's public intoxication, it's...\n\nCop #1: (interrupting) It's really time for you to shut the fuck up. (*Wow*)  Yeah, because getting back into a cruiser with you for another 6 hours is gonna be such a pleasure.  Never mind in my car, you shouldn't be in my profession! You are everything bad that people hate about cops in this town.(*HOLY FUCKBALLS! DID I JUST HEAR THAT*)\n\nI'm speechless, but I'm also turning green.  That last beer (or four) was a mistake.  Cop #1 turns around and looks at me.  I think he heard me question whether or not to trust that last belch.\n\nCop #1: You okay kid?\n\nNo, I'm not.  14 beers are about to come back.  I've been standing for too long not moving.  Need to get some air in my lungs, I don't feel good.  But there's a hedge about 8 feet away. I turn and go to bolt for it.  I turn, and take a fast step towards it, but hear commotion.\n\nCop #2: HE'S RUNNING!\n\nI try to make it to the hedge, and Cop #2 grabs me by the shirt and has a fistfull of hair. (*ouch*)  He spins me around, and before I or Cop #1 could do anything, runs me into the cruiser over the back wheel. (*This isn't good*)  I hear Cop #1 Yelling something, but can't make it out.  Cop #2 pulls me back up, and hurls me into the back of the cruiser.\n\nI land belly first, and fucking explode.  I hear a door slam. 14 beers comes up in three seconds of projectile vomiting.  I start gagging. It's vile.  Cheap beer and Doritos.  It keeps coming.  I think I see breakfast down there.  If they don't pull me out of the car I'm gonna drown.  But I start to feel better, at least.\n\nCop# 2: Fuck! Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nCop #1: He fucking turned green, you asshole!  He wasn't running, he was puking.\n\nI keep hacking shit up.  Spit a few times.  Imagine a guy chugging a 2 litre bottle of diet coke and chasing it with a pack of Mentos.  That's what it felt like.\n\nMe: (*weakly*)  I'm gonna hafta clean this shit up, aren't I?\n\nCop #2: Fucking right, you are.\n\nCop #1 Sticks his head into the cruiser to survey the damage.  I got the back of the driver's seat, some of it splashed up into the plastic divider thing, and there was so much on the floor you could float a toy boat down there.  But strangely enough, I was pretty spotless.  He grabs me by the belt and pulls me out and leans me against the cruiser.  He looks back inside, and walks to stand next to Cop #2, who has this big smile on his face.  He claps Cop #2 around the back of the neck.\n\nCop #1: No son, that task is reserved to an officer dumb enough to heave a kid with a bellyful of beer into the back of a police cruiser when he's trying to puke.  (*He looks at Cop #2*) After he bounced the kid off the cruiser. Violently.  And put him in the cruiser without searching him.  Or cuffing him.  With no charges.  (*He looks back at me*) Besides son, I think you'll be too busy drinking water and talking to our supervisor about how to file a complaint about excessive force and forcible confinement. (To Cop #2) Because throwing him in a car that doesn't open from the inside counts as confinement, even if it was only for a few seconds.  Get in the car, take it to the station, and clean it.  I don't want to ever fucking talk to you again.  Go. (*What the fuck just happened*)\n\nCop #2 doesn't say a fucking word.  He glares at me, and to his discredit at Cop #1.  He gets in the car, and fucking roars down the street.  Spitting gravel at the both of us.  Cop #1 hold up a finger at me, and gets on his radio.\n\nCop#1: 4220 to command?\n\nRadio: 4220. Command copies.\n\nCop #1: 4220 request pickup at (Street Name and Road Name) with passenger.\n\n(*Passenger?*)\n\nRadio: Did you just say a passenger (Cop#1)? What happened to your car?\n\nCop #1: Well, it needs to be cleaned. Code 10-Two-Four.  (*I later found out this was an informal code for \"some shithead puked in the cruiser\". A case of beer is called a Two-Four in Canada for those who don't know.*)  And since (Cop #2) made it happen, he's gonna clean it.  Besides, I gotta kid here with a story to tell you. You'll wanna hear it.  \n\nRadio: Ooookayyy?   Sgt (Supervisor) will be there shortly.\n\nAn unmarked comes to get us in about 10 minutes.  I the meantime, I start to sober up, and Cop #1 tells me to just tell the unvarnished truth.  The whole story, including last weeks escapade about the radio.  We hop in the car, and Cop #1 actually gets the Sgt to make a Timmies run and buys me a coffee and grabs a box of TimBits that we share at the station sitting at the Sgt's desk. (*TimBits are awesome to a drunk kid*)  I tell the whole story.  We go see another Cop, this time he's wearing a suit.  Tell the story again.\n\nPlainclothes Officer: (Cop #1) Do you corroborate this kid's story?\n\nCop #1: 100% sir.  He was trying to puke someplace other than my shoes and (Cop #2) grabbed him, threw him against the vehicle, then confined him in the vehicle without searching him, cuffing him, or charging him.\n\nPlainclothes Officer: Were you going to charge him with anything?\n\nCop #1: No sir.  Right attitude, friendly but tipsy. And it would only have been two citations if I was going to do it anyway.  Never would have cuffed him for it, or placed him in the vehicle.\n\nPlainclothes Officer: So you agree that (Cop #2)'s actions were excessive?\n\nCop #1: Yessir.\n\n  Get sent out with Cop #1.  We sit outside the station on a bench and finish the TimBits.  I am as sober as a Baptist Minister by this point.\n\nCop #1: Now kid, I'm not supposed to say anything here, but I wouldn't push to make a complaint.  That could make things hard here for your folks.  It's a small town.  You make a complaint against a cop, other cops are gonna react. (*No Shit*)  But that's up to you, and you have 6 months to make that decision.  I'd just tell my story, and see what happens.  If you're not happy, you can come back with your folks later.\n\nMe: Okay.\n\nThere's a tap on the window, and another cop is waving us in.  We spent about twenty minutes outside.  We go back inside and get waved right into the office of the Plainclothes cop I talked to before.  \n\nPlainclothes Officer: (To me) You are not being charged with anything. (*What the fuck would I have been charged with, desecration of a cruiser?*)  (Cop #1) will drive you home.  If you wish to file a complaint, you are free to come back and do so.  But before you make that decision, there is something I want to show you.\n\nI look at Cop #1, and he literally shrugs at me.  I look back to the Plainclothes officer, who reaches into his desk drawer.  He takes out a nameplate and puts it on the desk. I quickly read \"CAPTAIN (Blank): DETACHMENT CHIEF. (*Holy Fuck, did I just tell the Police Chief of a tiny-ass town that I got beat up by a cop? That ain't good.*)  He continues to remove things from a desk. A Badge, and a gun come next.\n\n\"He's an asshole we couldn't get rid of.  Now we can.  Thanks kid.\"\n\n(*FUCK YEAH!*)\n\nCOP#1 smiles.  We get told to leave.  We walk back to the back of a building, and head towards another cruiser.  It's like 3 a.m. at this point.  I'm exhausted, thirsty, and my ribs hurt from the puking. Before we reach the car, Cop #1 pats me on the back.\n\nCop #1: My Faith in the world got a little better tonight, kid.\n\nMy Faith in cops got a lot better that night.\n\nI never saw him again.  Went back to school in the fall and moved to the city permanently.  I'm sorry if this sounds like the end of \"Stand By Me\" without hearing about Teddy, but Cop #1 was a good cop in a shitty town.

        "text": "**Sorry it's been a while, I've had a crazy few weeks here at work.**\n\n_______________\n\n\nI was parked in my favorite high visibility parking spot in the barrio – a white-lined section of the road meant to prevent people from making an illegal turn into the back side of a one-way road meant to be the delivery exit of a shopping center. The white lines were as effective at their job as a colander bailing out a sinking boat and the subsequent violators would frequently cause a roadblock for the semi-trailers that were trying to obey the law and exit through the correct egress. I’m just explaining this because I sometimes felt guilty sitting in an area where everyone could see me but I could be as anti-social as I liked. \n\nThe day was grey and gloomy, a cold morning in early fall with a steady drizzle that was just enough to confound any attempt to set the cruiser’s windshield wipers to an automatic function and keep my view clear. Not that it really mattered; I was content to sit in my warm car, listening to the chatter of the dispatched while sipping a pumpkin flavored coffee and perusing the free commuter newspaper I had snagged while at my favorite 7-11. \n\nI looked up, more out of habit than with any intention to find trouble, and took in a strange view. A shivering young Vietnamese woman, probably in her twenties, was hobbling up the sidewalk in my direction. Her strange gait had an obvious cause – she was missing one of her tall stiletto high-heeled shoes, and she ambled in a way that would make any Frankenstein actor jealous. She was clutching her shoulders across her chest with the dual purpose of maintaining her body heat and shielding herself from the gawking day-laborers who were streaming alongside her on the sidewalk and stumbling over themselves trying to get a full view of the barely dressed beauty. She looked miserable but there was something else in her expression: anger. I could tell from a block away she was pissed at something, and to make matters worse, it appeared as though she was aiming herself in my direction. \n\nI waited with slight trepidation as she walked up the sidewalk, into the street (ignoring the oncoming car that had better sense than to honk at her) and across the two lanes to my cruiser. I rolled down the window and smiled, hoping I wasn’t about to be subjected to some undeserved tirade. \n\n“Morning, ma’am. You look a little cold. Everything ok?”\n\n“You know Chad Jones?” She avoided the pleasantries and launched into her mission. \n\n“The officer? Chad Jones?” I did know him; he was a senior member of my squad.\n\n“Yes, stupid. Chad Jones. You tell that sonovabitch he better not show his ugly face ‘round my store again. That asshole is a dead man if I see him. He thinks I’m some sort of whore he can fuck around with and leave like trash! Well, I’ll show him! I’m gonna get him dirty on something; take away his stupid badge he loves to fling around. That sonovabitch is going to pay for treating me like trash! I’ll call my friends and they’ll be looking out for him too! You warn that dickhead I’m going to grab his balls and rip them off!” The venom flowed from her mouth with the foreign cadence of a non-native English speaker but clearly she was no rookie when it came to fighting words. \n\nI realized I had recoiled away from the window and was leaning precariously over my center console and half consumed coffee when she stopped. A crowd of day-laborers had formed across the street, smiling at my misfortune but keeping their distance from the aggressive tigress.\n\n“Oh –ok. Yeah, I’ll let Chad know you’re angry. Uh… what’s your name?” I needed to save some face.\n\n“You don’t need to know my name dickhead! Hell, that asshole probably doesn’t even remember. Just pass this along to him.” She raised two hands with only their immaculately manicured middle fingers raised before backing away from my car. \n\n“D-do you need a ride?” I asked her back. \n\nShe replied with another raised middle finger shot over her shoulder and hobbled into the shopping center. I always did have a way with the ladies. The day laborers were chuckling amongst themselves while they dispersed and I shot them a shrug of the shoulder to indicate my confusion with the whole interaction. \n\nThe priority tones interrupted my confusion. “3alpha20, 6alpha10, 7alpha10, start for 123 Side Street for a report of a shooting in area 6. Caller states he got into an altercation while walking his dog. He did report shots were fired. Call taker indicates a gun shot and yelling were heard on the line. Caller disconnected and no answer on call back. Oh-eight-seventeen hours.”\n\nI jammed my car into gear and hit my lights and siren, startling the small group of day-laborers still laughing at my misfortune. I’m sure they were thinking I was just trying to make a cool exit from the otherwise humiliating scene but I didn’t care as my tires spun on the wet pavement and I tore out of the barrio towards the call. \n\n“3alpha20, 6alpha10, 7alpha10, and all other units responding – we have a second call coming in from a resident of the apartment complex. Caller states she heard two or three gunshots and yelling coming from the path behind the building. No sign of anyone. We’ll keep her on the line as units arrive on scene.”\n\nIt sounded like a legitimate shooting so far – we usually got these call and it turned out to be fireworks or something. I pulled down the street of the call and turned off my siren, coasting to a stop behind another two cars already there. \n\n“EMR, keep an eye on that trail head, Nick and I are going to check around the back of the building.” Lt was doing his thing and I obeyed. A fourth cruiser pulled up and Chad popped out. \n\n“Where’re we at?” He asked as he scanned the wood line and approached me.\n\n“Lt and Nick are checking around back,” I nodded my head in their direction without taking my eyes off the woods. “I’m just standing by here to see if anyone comes running out.”\n\n“Cool, I’m with you.” Chad had the hood of his holster down and his hand resting on his gun while he continued to scan the woods for any sign of movement. \n\n“Officers?” A timid voice called from behind me and I whipped around to see who had approached. A frail looking elderly man in a trench coat and soggy, wide brimmed hat waved when we made eye contact. “I’m the one who called first; the one who shot.” \n\n“The one who… you shot?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.” He lifted the right flap of his trench coat and showed us his holstered revolver. “I thought he was going to kill me.”\n\n“Wha-who?” I asked, still trying to wrap my head around the situation. \n\n“The man in the woods. He’s crazy I think. He struck Nippers here with a stick and was going to hit me too.” He looked down at the soaked terrier mix leashed to his wrist. I noticed Lt and Nick were coming back to the cars. \n\n“Lt! This is the guy who called in first.” I watched as Lt gave a quizzical scan of the man. \n\n“Are you ok? Where’s the weapon? Was anyone struck?” He asked rapid fire. \n\n“I’m fine, so is Nippers. My gun’s right here,” He raised his coat again, showing the weapon to Nick and Lt, “I have my concealed carry permit. And yes, I struck him at least once. I don’t know where he is. He took off running into the woods after I fired.” He was remarkably calm.\n\nSeveral other units had arrived at that point so we were all gathered around the man to hear his version of events. He said that while taking his daily walk with Nippers, he heard something crashing through the underbrush. A homeless guy, Jack, (we knew of him from other encounters and this was his turf) emerged onto the path, sasquatch-like, carrying a large tree branch. Nippers was, understandably, taken aback by the sudden appearance of the wild-man and began barking. Jack yelled, ‘Shut up yer damn dog’ and swung the branch, flinging Nippers off the trail. The elderly man yelled some obscenity at Jack and went to help his dog. Jack, having taken offense to the elderly man’s defiance in the face of crazy, closed in on the man and had some not-so-kind words along the lines of ‘this is my land’ and a few names taken from the Vietnamese woman’s lexicon. The old man drew his gun, Jack called his bluff and moved to smash him with the branch, and the man fired. He then called 9-11. Jack recovered enough to make a second attempt at a skull smash, but the old man fired a second time and Jack took off back in the direction he had first come from. \n\n“Well, crap. We have a crazy, shot person out in the woods somewhere with a blunt weapon. He’s going to be panicky and tough to wrangle, but we can’t let him bleed out.” Lt divided us into teams of two and we took off in the direction indicated by the old man. Chad and I were partnered up. \n\n“I was hoping I’d run into you during the shift.” I started as we climbed over logs and made our way around muddy puddles. \n\n“Oh? Why, wassup?” Chad asked over his shoulder as he used his baton to brush away some thorns. \n\n“I had a little run in with one of your girlfriends this morning over in the barrio.” I left it at that for a moment and could see the hamster wheel spinning in Chad’s head.\n\n“The barrio? I haven’t dated any Spanish chicks for a couple months.” Chad’s version of date was unabashedly a synonym for a one-night stand. \n\n“Oh, she wasn’t Spanish.” I smiled. \n\n“Ooooh, the Vietnamese piece! Wassername… Trung? Trang? She’s something, huh? Crazy in the sack too!” He had stopped and turned to half face me, huge smile on his face and eyes staring into the distance in an effort to better remember the night before. \n\n“Yeah? Well, I guess those days are over. She’s pissed at you.” I broke the news and Chad reacted suddenly, eyes drooping in concern at the loss of a new play-thing. \n\n“What? Why?” He asked, broken.\n\n“I don’t know. Said you treated her like a whore and tossed her away like trash. What was she doing over in the barrio anyway?”\n\n“She said she like being treated like a whore.” Chad mumbled to himself, shoulders drooped with the sad news. “Oh, as for the barrio, I’ve got a hook up in the Gardens Apartments. Free apartment as long as I patrol the grounds off duty a couple times a week. It’s easy. Drag in a couch and a bed and you got yourself the perfect sex-shack!” \n\nHis jubilance returned as he explained to me his “brilliant” setup. “Y’see, I can have one chick staying at my other place, while knocking boots in the other. The job gives me an excuse to be late or work overnight, and having two addresses means double the poon!” He smiled at me, wide eyed and expectant of a high five. \n\n“Uh…nice?” The whole thing seemed a little dirty to me. \n\n“Y’know… I thought Tring was one of my regular pad chicks…” Chad’s eyes squinted in concentration. “Oh crap! Latonya was coming over this morning! Oh shit! I wonder if they met. She’s got a key!” \n\nI just shook my head and passed Chad on the trail, scanning the woods for the wounded homeless guy while Chad mumbled to himself about all the ways his “perfect” setup could have been foiled. \n\nOur radio crackled with an out-of-breath Nick. “He’s… running along… the creek!”\n\nChad and I took off down the trail knowing the creek was only a few hundred yards away. We came to a halt and listened for any sign of the fleeing patient but heard only the babbling of water over rocks and the chirping of birds. \n\n“Y’know,” Chad whispered, still stuck on his previous quandary, “It’s probably for the best. Tuang was a little crazy. And Latonya! Don’t get me started. She could be a royal pain in the ass. It’s probably the bad karma catching up to the both of them that it ended this way.” \n\nSuddenly, a cracking of branches and wheezing gasps for air drew our attention to the other side of the creek. The wild-man Jack was limping perpendicular to us on a bluff above the creek bed, only a dozen feet of creek and a six foot drop of elevation separated us. \n\n“Stop!” Chad yelled. The wild-man reeled and noticed us before turning course and running in a direction away from us. Chad backed up a few paces and then sprinted forward, hurtling himself across the creek onto the bank on the other side. Immediately on impact, he sunk up to his thighs in thick mud.\n\n“SHIT! I’M STUCK!” He yelled back to me. \n\nI was already on the move though, taking the few extra yards down the trail to the paved ford the park service had installed several months prior and sprinting up the hill towards Jack. I arrived just behind Nick who had bear-hugged the fleeing gunshot victim into complacency and we called in backup to assist in taking him from the woods out to a spot where rescue could take over. \n\nI let several minutes pass with Nick and Jack before going to rescue Chad. In the time that had passed, he had managed to exhume himself only about three inches. He had also managed to cake mud into all of his duty gear and all over the front of his uniform shirt.\n\n“Little help?” He asked me as I carefully made my way over the muddy flood plain to assist him. I grabbed some drift wood and scrap lumber that had been washed downstream in the last flood and made a makeshift platform to hoist him onto. He lay on his back for a moment, breathless and filthy. \n“Karma, huh?” I asked.\n\nThe old man was never charged with the shooting. Jack gave a similar version to the one we heard but painted the picture in a way to make us believe the dog-walker had a pack of starving Doberman pincers out for a stroll instead of twenty pounds of fuzzy Nipper. We tracked down Jack’s camp – an ancient van stuck in some mud off the path – and located dozens of stolen articles inside he had pilfered from the nearby apartment complex. He was charged with multiple burglaries after being released from the hospital. \n\nChad eventually downsized his living arrangement setup, settling on just one bachelor pad. He slowed down his womanizing enough to meet a steady girlfriend and eventually became engaged. That engagement was abruptly terminated when the scandal of him sleeping with the rookie he was training broke at the department. I think he’s still riding a desk somewhere. Karma’s a bitch sometimes. \n",

        "text": "I was 19. Had my first car, a grey 2-door Buick which I despised, but it got me around so I couldn't hate it that much. I was also jobless aside from running an eBay store. This particular day I was going about job hunting and also attempting to pay off a few hospital bills. Y'know, minding my own business. \n\nAs I'm nearing the intersection to the hospital, I notice that, behind the minivan behind me was a police car with its lights on (no sirens). The minivan was flashing its headlights as if it were trying to get my attention, but I was in my own world doing my own thing so I paid it no mind. \n\nAs I turned onto the road to the hospital, I noticed the minivan keep going straight, but the officer was right on my tail. So, I figure I'd find a place to pull over. This road, I should point out, was not designed for a pull over as it had guard rails instead of white lines and thus no breakdown lane. For a while it was basically a slow-speed chase because I didn't want to just stop on the road. Eventually we got to the hospital parking lot, so I pulled into a space, parked, and waited in the car. \n\nI should point out this was my first time being pulled over. I didn't know that police took so long, so I decided to get out of the car. The instant I open the door, the officer talks over the loudpseaker: \"driver, stay in the vehicle!\" Ok, ok, fine... \n\nSo as I sit there 'admiring' the bright blue interior and fake wood trim, I eventually hear a knocking on the window. I looked up and there were three cruisers surrounding my car, each with an officer standing beside them, hands on their guns. I open the door slightly (the power windows don't work when the car is off), the officer stopping it from opening too far, and ask, \"Hello officer. Why did you pull me over?\"\n\nWithout hesitation he spoke: \"Sir (side note: at this point I was a guy. Long story.), do you own this vehicle?\"\n\n\"Uh... well legally no, but technically yes.\" My thinking was that technically, I drove and maintained the car, but it belonged to my dad legally. \n\n\"I see. Can I see your license and registration please?\"\n\nI shuffled about in the glove box trying to find the registration. I found it, then went for my wallet in my back pocket. I hear another officer yell, \"FREEZE!\", so I did. The first cop tells the second to lower his weapon, then tells me to step out of the vehicle. Apparently this looked like I was going to pull a gun or something, I dunno.\n\nNeed I say I was both confused and worried at this point? So, I get out, he tells me to spread my legs and put my hands on the roof. He pats me down, then grabs my wallet and tells me to get back in the car. I comply, shaking like crazy. \n\nA few minutes later he comes back and asks me various questions about the car, like when I got it and whatnot, basically making sure I knew the car's general history I guess. Eventually he tells me what's going on: \"This vehicle is currently not registered. There is also a wanted car thief who recently stole a car very similar to this (side note: it was also a grey 2-door Buick, but a different VIN and totally different model year - I guess all American cars do look the same :) and we wanted to be sure this is not the wanted vehicle.\"\n\n\"Oh, well... that's interesting... so I'm free to go then?\" By this point one of the cruisers had left, so I'm guessing I was in the clear.\n\n\"Not quite. Your car has not been registered for 5 months. I see you haven't had a license for very long, so let me tell you something. See that registration sticker [on the windshield]? You need to get your car re-registered every year on that month.\"\n\n\"Ohhhh, riiight... sorry about that... So you'll let me off with a warning?\" Clearly I wasn't particularly good at charming people to my whims.\n\n\"Ah, no. If it were a few weeks out of date, sure, but 5 months? Sorry, I have to fine you for that. Also, I can't let you drive it until you get it re-registered.\"\n\n\"Ugh, dude seriously? What if I just drive it anyway?\" In retrospect, this may have been the wrong thing to say.\n\n\"Then another officer will pull you over and fine you again, if not revoke your license. Leave it here until you get a new sticker.\"\n\nSo, he wrote me a ticket, told me to walk to town hall with the ticket, license, and registration, get it re-registered, and put the new sticker on. Bear in mind that my income was basically nil and I have $100 to my name. Yeah, this would go well...\n\nLong story short, I paid the hospital bill of $73, walked the three miles to my house to get more money and a bike, went to town hall, found I couldn't pay for it, so I rode to my car and drove it home anyway. A weeks later, after a couple eBay sales, I could register the car, and a few weeks after that I managed to pay the fine as well. \n\nLesson learned: register your car when it is due, otherwise you'll be seen as a car thief.",

        "text": "BLUF: This ends well due to a sensible police officer, but I needed new pants.\n\nFour teenagers, mid-90s, northern VA, walking down the street after dark.  Two of them wearing some sort of flannel shirts, the other two in coats.  I'm one of the ones in a coat.  In fact, it was an awesome coat, a Columbian jacket with all sorts of crazy huge pockets on the inside like it was meant for smuggling.  We're headed home after being at the pool hall for awhile.\n\nWe're a neighborhood away and mostly home when we're lit up in red and blue.  We turn around and a single officer steps out of the car and asks if he can talk to us.  Being early teenagers we didn't think we really had a choice.  He IDs us but we didn't have any IDs.  We were about 14 to 15, not driving yet (obviously).  Conversation went something close to this (I'm the spokesman for the group):\n\n\"So where you guys coming from?\"  \n\"We were at the Nova, sir.\"  (Short name for the pool hall)  \n\"Oh yeah?  Nowhere else?\"  \n\"No sir.\"  \n\"Walked straight from there?\"  \n\"Yes sir.\"  \n\"If I call the pool hall, will they say you were there?\"  \n\"Yes sir\"  (we knew the owner.  It was a small place.)  \n\"You guys mind if I just search you real fast?  Simple pat down?\"  \n\"No sir.  Go ahead.\"  \n\nNo idea what this is about but the cop seemed a bit edgy.  Now, remember I mentioned my coat?  Well, he pats the front of my coat and he notices there's some stuff there.  He asks me to take it all out.  Out comes three packs of cigarettes, a zippo, extra flints for the zippo, and a medium sized bottle of lighter fluid.  I always felt like my zippo was empty so I just got to carrying around the fluid, and there was a zipper inside the left side of the coat with a pocket that was almost the whole left side of the jacket, so you could fit a **lot** of shit in there.  If you stacked it right, it sat down flat too.\n\nThis is where he decides to tell us that the reason he stopped us was because there had been an attempted arson a neighborhood over.  Two kids in flannel shirts were trying to light a field of dry dead tallgrass on fire by the community pool.  He and some other officers were searching for them because they had run off when they saw cops.\n\nSo there we were.  Two dudes in dark coats, two in flannel shirts, and I'm carrying a lighter and 12 fl oz of lighter fluid... and a load of shit in my pants.\n\nI started freaking the fuck out.  We had absolutely nothing to do with whatever that incident was.  I started re-babbling our alibi, urging him to call the pool hall and ask!  Eventually we're all going crazy.  Omigodyagottabelieveme!\n\nHe raises a hand and tells us to calm down.  He steps aside with me because two of us were not doing as instructed.  He turns me away from my friends and says, \"Look I believe you, alright?  I believe you were at the Nova.\"  He never really said why he believed me, but I assume now this much later in life that he simply had smelled bullshit a million times to know when he wasn't smelling it.\n\nI let out a huge sigh of relief, and he says, \"Wait here.\"  He goes and gets in his car and we're just standing there.  My buddies are all asking me what's happening and yada yada.  I didn't know, but I kept repeating, \"Shh, relax alright?  He said he believes us.  We're good.\"  The question being that if he believes us, why are we still waiting?  However, no one asked that question.  I assume now that he was just researching whatever he could to make sure we were clean.  I mean we had given him names so who knows.\n\nHe finally gets out of the car and he says, \"Alright guys, you're free to go.  Just... shit I don't know... I don't know!\"  He really wants to say something here but eventually just says, \"Wait here.\"  He goes back to his car, comes back with a simple Bic lighter.  He hands it to me and says, \"There, now you won't have to walk around with a full damn pyro kit, alright?  Just be careful.\"  \nI almost told him I like the zippo better.  You know, like an idiot.\n\nThen he jumps in the car and drives off.  Four kids under 18 with smokes on them that just came from a pool hall where they're not supposed to allow people under 18.  He just let all that go because, shit at least we weren't arsonists!\n\nOh and I still carry Bic lighters.  Dude was right.  I refilled the zippo like every week but the friggin Bic in my pocket right now has been there for months!",

        "text": "Okay, this is the story of my first run-in with the police from my hometown, and surprisingly, one of them was actually a pretty good guy.  The players in this little story are:\n\n* Cop #1 - 40ish, kinda chubby, a little silver at the temples, and has seen every amount of stupid a small town can generate\n\n* Cop #2 - The stereotypical rookie. Crew cut, big arms, and a scowl.  I got the feeling this guy was a bully his whole life and somehow got to become a police officer and fulfill his life's ambition of being an asshole and beating people up legally, once he baits somebody into raising their voice at them.\n\n* Me.  Eighteen year old version of me. Drunk off my ass.  Trying to stagger home and go to bed after a party.\n\nI'm walking home from a buddies house, school had just let out, and we managed to get our hands on a LOT of liquor.  So, being the dateless losers we were, we sat around in his basement, played video games, ate pizza, and got wasted.  Really wasted.  I think 4 teenagers consumed 3 26ers over the course of the night.  Not pretty.  But I remember being smart, and taking the all car keys and giving them to my buddy's mom.  She then essentially gave us carte blanche to do what we wanted, I guess as a reward for being upfront about the drinking and safe about it.  So at the end of the night, I figured it was about time to head home, especially because I was the last one standing, and there was nowhere left to pass out but the floor.\n\nSo, I left, and started the walk home.  I knew it was only about 20 minutes, what's the worst that could happen to a drunken teenager at 12:30 in a tiny town?  I'll tell you what. Enter the scowling Constable Peachfuzz, hereinafter simply known as cop #2.  I'm walking (or staggering if you really want to get technical) down the side of the road, as there are no sidewalks.  Suddenly, everything gets brighter.  Hmm, that must be a car behind me. I'll step off the road to let them pass, and continue on my way. Hmm. I wonder why they're not passing me.  And why are the lights now red and blue?  Oh, shit.  Yeah. That's why.  \n\nBoth Officers get out.  Cop #1: \"You been drinking tonight, son?\" before I could open my mouth, Cop #2 shines a flashlight in my eyes. \"What else were you doing? You carrying anything illegal? Why didn't you answer my partner?\"\n\nCop #1: It's not partner, it's supervising Officer.  He hasn't answered my question, because you wouldn't let him. And if he was carrying anything illegal, do you think he's sober enough to remember? I could smell the booze on him from the cruiser.  Put down the flashlight and shut up.\"  (*I already liked him*.)   Maybe we can talk to him before you decide to arrest anyone.  (To me) \"Son, I'm gonna guess you've had a fair bit to drink, seeing as how vertical seems a bit hard for ya right now.  That Correct?\"\n\n (Hicc). \"Yessir.\" (Hiccup)\n\nCop #1: (To Cop #2) Sir.  That's one point for the kid. (To me) Got a driver's license?  How about a vehicle?\n\nMe: Yessir. I got my lishence in my wallet, if I can find it. (Finds wallet, gives license to Cop #1) And my truck. My Truck's back at...(hic) Back at Johnny's house.  I'll get it...(hic) I'll get it tomorrow morning.\n\nCop #1: You might want to make that tomorrow afternoon.\n\nMe: (hic) good idea.\n\nCop #2: (lookin at my license) Says here you're only 18.  So that's drinking underage, public intoxication...\n\nCop #1: I thought I told you to shut up.  Kid's got a license, and a truck, and he's smart enough to leave it at his buddie's place while he's hammered. That's 2 points.  \n\nCop#2: Yeah, well, manual says we run him in, book him, and wait for the duty Sgt to decide what to do.\n\nMe: Oh come on man, I know I'm drunk, thass why I'm walkin'.  Why you wanna arrest me?\n\nCop #2: Why don't you shut the hell up before I arrest you for causing a disturbance?\n\nMe: (Looking around at a town of 12,000 people, in the middle of the night) What dishturbance?  Ain't nobody here to disturb. (*He didn't like that*)\n\nCop#1: Why don't I decide who gets arrested here?  (to Cop #2) Back up, and be quiet.  (To me) Okay kid, here's what's gonna happen.  We're not gonna arrest you. (*Thank Christ*) But we're gonna have to call your folks for a ride home because we can't leave you in public like this.\n\nMe: Oh fuck! Can't you just arrest me instead? My old man will fuckin' kill me.\n\nCop#1 smiles when I say that.\n\nCop#1: That's three points.\n\nCop#2: Are you kidding me?  Now you're asking to get arrested. What?\n\nCop#1: I think the young lad is more afraid of his parents getting pissed at him the he is of getting booked for something that will get reduced to a $50 fine and a slap on the wrist.\n\nMe: No shit! If I don't get my ass whooped, I'm gonna be cutting the grass twice a day for a month just so he can watch me do it.\n\nCop#1: (to cop #2) A boy more afraid of his parents than he is of the police is a sign of a boy raised right. He was polite, he did what I asked, didn't get angry, even when you threatened him, and carried himself pretty good, despite being three sheets to the wind. He's going home. Give him his wallet back. (To me) Okay kid, think you can stagger to the car and hop in the back? We'll just run you home and you can take you chances with your Dad on your own. (*THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU*)\n\nMe: (hic) You got it, Offisher.  Thanks.\n\nIn the car, it's only a short drive. I only had a few blocks left in my walk when they picked me up. Cop#1 is driving, but Cop #2 is continuously looking back at me. He's pissed he didn't get to arrest me. Guy's got a hardon for something to do.  They pull up to my house, and Cop #1 comes around to open the door and let me out.  He actually closes the door quietly. I really like this guy.\n\nCop #1: Now I better not see you walking down that street hammered again next week, right?\n\nMe: No sir.  Thank you sir.  I'll (hic) definitely go easy next weekend.\n\nCop #1: Good idea.  Take off.\n\nI walk towards the house.  I see Cop #1 looking around at the houses or something, when THE FUCKING LOUDSPEAKER TURNS ON. Cop #2 has the mic in his hand with the hugest shiteating grin on his face. He chirps the siren at me and says over the loudspeaker \"YOU HAVE A SAFE NIGHT KID. TRY NOT TO GET AS DRUNK NEXT WEEKEND.\"\n\nI am completely boggled. What the fuck? We worked it out, Cop #1 was a cool guy, he told this shithead to be quiet, and what the fuck does he do? Fuckin throws my ass under the bus. Motherfucker! I can see lights turn on all over the fuckin neighbourhood.\n\nCop #1: (To me, very pissed) I will deal with this.\n\n\nFuck was my Dad pissed.\n\n I told him the story with a few detail glossed out, and he pretty much let me off the hook because in his eyes \"Boy, that cocksucker really tried to fuck you over, didn't he? Set you right the fuck up.  Sleep it off, and get my truck back after you cut the grass.\"\n\n\nNext story: The next weekend.\n\n",

        "text": "This story was from when I was seventeen, and have not had as much as a speeding ticket since this incident. When I was younger I was not exactly the poster boy for upstanding behavior. Now I wasn't some little thug committing heinous crimes on a nightly bases. However I will admit that I, like most seniors my age, dipped into their parents alcohol stash and taken a few beers. So I swigged down exactly two twelve oz cans of Coors light and decided hey its a beautiful spring night, just starting to get warm, I think I should go take a walk downtown. So I call up my buddy and we decided to go take a walk on the local beach. This is a small town of about 5,000 residents so nothing was really going on. We get to the beach and we see a party of about 50 kids just milling about with a small fire. I say to my buddy \"ehh screw that I don't really feel like getting busted for drinking on the beach\" and we continue on our merry way shooting the shit. So we are walking back when I hear one of the kids at the party yell out \"Hey! floatingfeathers whats up come over!\" Which is kind of weird cause its pitch black out and I have no idea how he knew it was me. So I walk over and hangout for all of five minutes. All of a sudden their are flashlights all around us and officers yelling \"small town pd, don't move!\" So I say to myself why would I possibly run, I had two beers at my house, and I definitely wasn't drunk let alone drinking on the beach. I figure I would be in a lot more trouble if I ran and they caught me. All of a sudden people just begin to scatter running this way and that, still I just stand their and don't run. Long story short they line us up, take all our identification and call our parents. The officer that took my i.d. is pissed cause he both knows me and because we made him get his boots dirty. In the meantime they make us clean up all the beer cans littering the beach, which really pissed me off at the time because I was there for five minutes, and didn't even drink a beer on scene. So after spilling discarded beer all over myself we start the walk of shame to the beach parking lot.  Peoples parents are lining up to pick their kids up one by one. Then I see it. At the time the thing I considered to be the most fearful entity in my young mind. My Italian mother rolls up in her soccer mom Subaru Forester and jumps out. \"Floatingfeathers get your fucking ass in this fucking car right now, before I drag you by your fucking hair!!!!\" I look at the officer pleadingly and he just looks at me and says \"dude you better get in the car now\". To this day she still scares the shit out of me more then that officer. ",

His wife described him as a male, white, six foot tall, overweight, wearing a camouflage hat, from Arkansas, and oh yah…missing his left eye.  She tells me his name is Mark Smith.  (Not his real name, but important for the story.)\n\n\nHis wife tells us he will be arriving at their motel room in the next few minutes.  So we head over to the motel, find a good spot to park where we can see the motel room, and wait.\n\n\nI see a male open the door at the motel room in question, so I hit the gas to the front door of the motel room and jump out of the car.  “Hey bud, come over here and talk to me.”\n\n\nThe male is cooperative and walks over to my car.  The male fits the description to a tee.  Literally the best description I have ever gotten.  Wearing a camouflage hat, super crazy Arkansas accent, and missing his left eye.\n\n\n“What is your name”, I ask him.  “Timothy West, sir”, he says.  “Ok.”, I reply.  At this point I am playing it cool.\n\n\nThe male says, “I know who you are looking for.  My friend’s husband, right?  I think he is wanted.” \nI tell him the man I am looking for is missing his left eye.  “I knew he was missing an eye, but I didn’t know it was the left eye.  You would be surprised how many people are missing eyes”, he says.\n\n\nI am now doing my best not to laugh.  I want him to dig a hole.  “So you are telling me there is another guy walking around here matching your description, from Arkansas, with a camouflage hat, AND a missing left eye?”  He is unfazed.  Cool as a cucumber.\n\n\nI look him dead in the eye and say and in my best dubious tone say, “Mark.”  He pauses and looks at me with a quizzical look, “Who?”\n\n\nMy partner and I burst out laughing.  Mark finally comes clean.  “Ok ok….you got me.  Motherfuckers gotta try, right?”\n",

        "text": "hello everyone long time reader, first time posting my own story.  This happened a few days ago and sense it has been years sense my last run in with an officer I thought maybe id post it?\n\nIt was a normal Friday night as I headed out to work.  The road I take to work every night has 8 stoplights and most times I can make it through all of them of them with out stopping.  The speed limit on the road is 45 so I always set my cruise control to 45 and just go.  For about a mile the speed limit drops to 40 mph but I dont bother slowing down because well its 11pm and most cars that drive this road anyway are going 50+ mph.  So I am cruising along at 45 coming up to a major intersect that I normally do get stopped at.  This night how ever was a rare night that I made the green.  Unfortunately I was kind of in my own little work and dint even start hitting the brakes until I was well into the intersection.  I tapped the brakes and slowed down to what I thought was a reasonable speed but never looked down at my actual speed.  The speed limit on that road right after the intersection is 30 mph.  I then make my left hand turn and go right to the right lane.  Shortly after that I see the dreaded red and blue lights in my rear view mirror. \n\nOfficer:  Good evening are you heading to (work pace)?\n\nMe: yes sir. (he probable say my uniform and we where only 2 blocks away from the plant)\n\nOfficer: well do you know why I pulled you over?\n\nMe: honestly sir, I do not.\n\nOfficer: when you made that left you should pull into the closest lane, also do you know how fast you where going?\n\nMe:  I could not have been going faster then 45\n\nOfficer: well do you know what the speed limit is on (street name)?\n\nMe: ... no sir I do not.\n\nOfficer: well its 30 and I clocked you at 40\n\nMe: well I was slowing down.... I just dont know how much I slowed down.\n\nThe officer says he will be right back and takes my license back to his car.  Mean while I am having a mini heart attack because it has been years sense I was pulled over for speeding, especially when I am always s careful about my speed.  A short while later the officer comes back.\n\nOfficer: I am going to let you off with a warning.  You need to drive carefully and watch your speed.  People coming in and out of that shopping center need to slow way down and you might need to stop suddenly.\n\nMe: thank you very much sir.  Have a good night.",

My dad taught me using the family car, which was a [Pontiac Wave](http://bestartcarz.com/data_images/gallery/01/pontiac-wave/pontiac-wave-07.jpg). This was a manual transmission car, which is somewhat unusual in Canada (I was one of around 10 kids in my school that learned to drive shift). \n\nWhen I first started driving I had some problems with the clutch/gas ratio and would either burn rubber or choke the engine. This lead to several hours of start/stop practice on the paved but abandoned parking lot next door. Finally my dad decided it was time to do some driving around town. I got better at to clutch/gas ratio thing and was usually able to get going without squealing tires or choking the engine...unless it was a hill start.\n\nOne sunny Saturday morning at around 10am Dad had some errands to run in town so he got me to drive him so that I could get some more practice. We successfully do our shopping and then head home. The route home took us up a slight hill that had a stop sign at the top. I stopped at the white line and waited for the my turn to turn right into a somewhat busy road. I see my chance and go for it...only to choke my engine and roll back somewhat. I glance in my rearview mirror to check if there was anyone behind me and see a Police Dodge Charger with two cops in it. Being a super--brand-new-learner-driver and this being my first \"meeting\" with cops on the road I got slightly nervous. I start the engine and try to get going again. Kill the engine again. I see the cops looking at me with their dark sunglasses in the mirror. Getting more nervous...I start the engine again. This time I just floored the gas so obviously \"SQUEAL\" *cloud of blue smoke* we lurch forward, up the hill, turn right and onto the road. \n\nI check the mirror and see both cops laughing their asses off. \n\nI have since gotten my full license and rarely kill the engine or burn rubber.\n\nPS: Not sure if this counts as a [Suspect] tag...",

        "text": "Back when I was in the academy, I had a little too much fun. It was a go-home academy, but with a 0500 roll call I probably shouldn't have gone out on work nights as often as I did. I kept it together, though, maintaining my grades and doing well in training. \n\nOn the day of final inspection, I overslept. I don't know how, or why it had to happen on the last day, but I did. As I was hurriedly getting dressed, I distinctly remember looking at my dress blouse and thinking, 'there's no way you're supposed to wear a nametag on a suit coat.' So I left both my nametags on the shelf.\n\nTurns out, you are supposed to wear a nametag on your dress blues. I borrowed one from a classmate just in time to be ordered to fall in for inspection. \n\nWe form up on the parade deck and in walks the Deputy Chief, a former Marine with shoes that gleam and creases so sharp you could cut a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with them. And my luck keeps getting better: he walks up to the first recruit and, as he's closely inspecting their uniform, bellows: \"State your name, hometown, and desired unit.\"\n\nHe goes from recruit to recruit, examining their dress blues with a fine tooth comb, while each one states their last name loudly and proudly. I'm standing near the back, wearing the tag of a liar, a liar's tag so obviously sitting on my chest, just screaming to the world that I'm unprepared, unqualified, stupid, sloppy, and unsure of my own identity. I clearly don't deserve to be here, and you've wasted nine months of pay on me. I'm sweating bullets as I hurriedly try to decide whether to say the name that's on my chest, and technically lie to an official, or my own name, and basically confess to being unprepared on the last damn day of the academy. \n\nFinally it's my turn, and at the last second I decide confidence is the way to go, and loudly recite my real name. Before he can verify with my nametag, however, he stops and looks at me with joyless eyes. \n\n\"Did you shave this morning?\"\n\nI hadn't.\n\n\"Yes sir. I just have a very heavy beard.\"\n\n\"Looks to me like you haven't touched a razor at all.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nEventually he grunts and turns to the next recruit, leaving me standing at attention in a puddle of flopsweat and a little terrorpee. \n\nLong story short(too late), I graduated, but these days I never go far without my nametag.

        "text": "This is the story of how I got accused of dealing drugs when I was 11.\n\nIt was fall, and the monthly D.A.R.E. dance was approaching. The dance, put on by the school's Drug Awareness Resistance Education program, was the social event to be at for us young kids. It came at a time when most of us were just starting to realize that the opposite sex was kinda interesting in an awkward tingly sort of way. So I put on my best t-shirt, threw an open button-up shirt over it, and had my parents drop me off at the local Knights of Columbus hall.\n\nI met up with some friends and had a pretty good time, as much as an awkward 11 year old can. I noticed my friend Tom had on a pretty sweet button-up, and he wore the same size I did. So I proposed a temporary trade, shirt for shirt. We made the switch and went back to dancing. Things got warm, so I went and grabbed a couple of paper cups of water for Tom and me, which he crumpled up and tossed in the front pocket of his shirt.\n\nThe night wore on, and Tom and I decided to switch shirts back before our parents showed up. As we went back to dancing, I noticed Tom had left the crumpled up water cup in my front pocket. I figured the polite thing to do would be to return it to him, so I walked up and slid the trash into his front pocket with a snide \"Happy Birthday\" and a couple of taps. We chuckled, and went back to dancing.\n\nThere had been a rumor going around school that kids were dealing drugs at the dances. I never thought anything of it. As a somewhat sheltered 11 year old in the rural midwest, drugs were something of a foreign concept. However, this justified the presence of a couple uniformed county police at the dance, and my little trash pass caught the attention of one. He stopped me, and demanded to know what I put in my friend's pocket. I stammered out an answer, confused as to what I had done to gain the attention of this angry uniformed adult. He then told me to empty out my pockets. I stumbled through putting all my things on the table, but my hands were beginning to shake a bit. Finally he told me to turn my pockets out. I turned out the front ones. \"Back pockets too\" he said, and bent over me to exam them. I was in blue jeans at the time, and the back pockets are nothing more than a patch over the denim. I tried to stammer out an explanation as to why I couldn't do it, but I had finally had enough. I collapsed into a fit of crying. The big, ugly, scrunched-face cry that is guaranteed to maximize embarrassment. The officer blanched, and told me to sit down and not move from that spot, and left.\n\nThe dance mercifully ended soon after, and a few months later the teasing stopped too.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm using a new account so as to adhere to my employer's social media policy of keeping our personal and professional identities separate when posting online.\n\nThis is a story about the worst call of my relatively young career; a story about lost innocence.\n\nIt's a Tuesday, midnight shift. The last day in our block, so my unit was feeling pretty good. We had some laughs during briefing and booked out at around 1840 hours. \n\nTonight, I'm partnered up with Joe (not his real name). Sweet! We have a good time together and have had quite a few \"interesting\" calls since we joined the same unit. Some guys call us Team Black Cloud, but it's all in good humour. I really respect Joe even though he is nearly a decade younger than me with only three months of extra seniority. He's a good cop.\n\nAs far as Tuesdays go, today was pretty slow. In this city, shit can hit the fan any day any time, and we've come to expect it. But tonight is gravy. Verbal domestic: keep the peace and separate the parties for the evening. Unwanted persons at the shelter house: gone before we arrived. Shoplifter in custody with store security: stole $20 worth of food - issued a trespass notice and a stern caution.\n\nCalls were pretty slow that night, so we had plenty of time to harass the local gangs and drug dealers. Lots of good intel. Found two kids smoking marijuana in their car in an empty parking lot. They peeled out as soon as we passed them. U-turn, traffic stop, weed down the sewer, a no plate light ticket (because they need some sort of punishment - cannabis is a controlled substance in my country after all), and a warning that his father might not like to know that his 17 year-old is smoking up in his car. I mean, it could be seized in the commission of a criminal offence...\n\nDamn. Lunch already? Head in to the station, grab a bite, and catch up on some paperwork.\n\nAn hour and a half later we book 10-8. \"Hey Joe, let's go sit on some drug houses.\" \"Sure thing, buddy.\" he says.\n\nApproximately 0400 hours - Dispatcher: \"93 to 121, attend at... for a domestic in progress. Call-taker is on the phone with a female who was beaten up by her ex-boyfriend who broke in to her residence. She ran across the street to call from a neighbour's house.\" \"121 10-4.\"\n\nWe are not 121. We are 232. Before I can even say it, Joe aims the vehicle towards their call and hits the gas. Joe is like that. If you ever need back-up, Joe will be the first guy there. We're doing about 20km/h over the speed limit. Reasonable based on the info we have.\n\nWe're about half way there. Dispatcher: \"93 to 121. Further update. The male is still in the residence with two children.\"\n\nI get on the radio. \"232, we'll head over to check on the kids.\" I'm sure everyone on the air could hear our engine revving, as we're now doing about 40km/h over the speed limit of 50km/h.\n\nWe're about one minute out when 121 books off with the complainant across the street.\n\nWe get to the scene and fire and ambulance are just pulling in as well. We step out of the car and try to orient ourselves. Which house are we going to? Okay, there's 121 at a residence on the north side of the street. I guess we're going to a house on the south side. It's dark. It's raining. I put on the my gloves and grab my flash light automatically. We start approaching the residence and...\n\nScreams. Sobs. We start jogging. There are two adult females on the front steps of the house, two children clutched in one of their arms. Their faces are tortured and covered in tears. All they are yelling is, \"Get downstairs, get downstairs!\"\n\nOkay, at least the kids are safe. The complainant is across the street. I guess we're looking for the ex-boyfriend.\n\nWe round the corner to the side door and it has been kicked in. Part of the door frame is on the landing and there are drops of blood leading down some steps front of me toward an open door and a up few steps to my right to a door that is slightly ajar. Okay, separate residences.\n\nWe start announcing ourselves and move down the stairs. Joe got in the door before me. Of course he did. At the bottom of the stairs, Joe moves to the right, so naturally, I move to the left after briefly looking right to see a living room and kitchen. Bedrooms must be this way. Yup, there's a dark hallway ahead of me with open doors. Except the room to my immediate left has the light on.\n\nI look into the bedroom and time stops. \n\nI see a young female; under 10 years old for sure. She's wearing her nightgown. She has long blonde hair. Her room is decorated with animal prints. Jungle animals. \n\nThe girl is lying on her side facing me.  Surrounding her is the biggest pool of blood I have ever seen. Nobody that small has that much blood inside of them. There is a no gore rule in the side bar, so I will leave it at that. Suffice it to say, \"gore\" does not adequately describe the scene.\n\n\"Fuck fuck fuck fuck. JOE!\"\n\nHe comes running to my side.  In a past life, Joe used to be a nurse. I am not a nurse, and I know she is dead.\n\nThose kids upstairs were not the kids we were looking for. Fuck. There's another kid in here somewhere.\n\nI tear myself away from the doorway to her bedroom. Nothing can be done for her, but I call out for the paramedics to get down here anyway. I call for backup. I don't say why. I think part of me knew that her mother was talking to the other officers across the street and I wanted to spare her the horror, for a few more moments anyway, of hearing about her daughter's condition over a police radio.\n\nFuck. There is still a job to do. Focus. Shit. I am in shock. I am in autopilot mode. I have tunnel vision. Where is that other kid? Bathroom. Clear. There's only one more room ahead of me. Master bedroom. Lights off. How did my gun get into my hand? Forward. I hear Joe let out a gut-wrenching, \"Noooooooooo!\" behind me. He's still in the room with her. He realized she's gone too. I enter the room in front of me.\n\nIt's clear. Except for the small figure with short dark hair laying on the bed facing the wall. I think it's a boy. Under 10 years old for sure. He's not moving. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I reach out and roll him over. He's looking at me with wide eyes. He blinks. He doesn't have any injuries. \n\n\"Where is your mom's boyfriend?\" I ask him. \"I don't know,\" he replies. \"He just left.\"\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I ask him. \"I am okay,\" he says. \"But why is my sister all bloody?\" \n\nSilence. I am trying to think of something to say.\n\nThat silence is broken by loud footsteps coming down the stairs. The person is running. My gun is up and I'm screaming at a paramedic to get on the ground. He's looking at me with terror in his eyes. I imagine I had the eyes of a crazed animal. It takes three seconds before I realize he's okay, and I put my gun down.\n\nHe's not okay because the next sight he sees is the horror show in the girl's bedroom. \"Holy fuck. We have to get her out of here!\"\n\nI shield the boy as Joe carries out his sister with the paramedic behind him. I give them a 10 second head start and I pick up the boy, cover his eyes, and carry him out too. I leave him with two responsible looking adults and tell them to get him across the street to his mother. They say they will. They know him.\n\nI see one of the officers from 121 standing in the middle of the road with a look of shock on his face. He's been dealing with mom the whole time, but just saw Joe load the girl into the ambulance. He sees me and snaps back to reality. \"I'm going back in the house to look for this fucking asshole,\" I say. He says that backup is coming. I turn robotically around and begin to march towards the house anyway. He grabs my vest and pulls me back. He repeats that backup is almost here. Apparently, I give him a look of sheer disgust. I have no recollection of this encounter. He tells me about it later during the debrief and apologizes. I thank him for thinking about my safety. I thank him on behalf of my wife and kid.\n\nEverything else happens how it happened. \n\nThe house was clear. We started a man-hunt for the killer. Eventually, we found him at the end of a rural road in his vehicle. I guess he realized what he did and felt guilty. He had taken his own life.\n\nI learned that the two women we initially met at the scene had seen the little girl before we did. They were sleeping upstairs when the killer barged into their house looking for his ex after she fled. One of the women, being a mother of two children who were asleep nearby, went ape shit on this guy and pushed him out into the back yard. Only then did she realized he was covered in blood with a knife in his hand. The guy bolted. She ran down to check on the family. She saw the little girl take her last breath. She put in a second 911 call. I didn't notice, but she had a cordless phone in her hand when we first got there.\n\nThe initial victim was brutally beaten. Her ex had kicked in her door and then kicked the shit out of her. She had lost consciousness. She ran across the street to call police. When asked by the call taker if she thought he would ever hurt her kids, she said, \"No.\" I mean honestly, the vast majority of people never would. I guess he was the exception.\n\nThere are more details to the story, but I don't think I can go into them at this point. There will be an inquest. I've tried to keep things as vague as possible so as not to get in shit with my superiors. They have treated all of us who were involved very well and extended support services to us. We had a group debrief with a counsellor and I have personally seen a PTSD specialist to go over coping strategies.\n\nPart of me dealing with this is sharing what I can of the story instead of bottling it up. Days and weeks go by when I don't think of it. Then I randomly do.\n\nEnough innocence was lost on that day and enough victims were created.\n\nI won't let this guy make me any more of a victim than I already am.",

It was wet from a recent rain so surely if anyone went through the window there would be footprints in the wet dirt.  Nothing!  So we tell Linda we need to go inside and check out the window.  She escorts us to the bedroom and points us to the window.  But something isn't right...there's a filing  cabinet in front of the window.  And it's heavy!  I ask her how they got in and she sticks to the \"**came through the window**\" story.  Whatever, I guess I should at least look for finger prints.  A whole lot of dust and a whole lot of nothing else.  \"Nothing about this make sense\" I was thinking.  And then I see it...A pistol...on the nightstand.  The pistol she reported stolen.  So I call her out.  \"Linda, what the Hell is going on?\"   Her exact words are as follows: \"My brother and daughter went into spirit form, came through the window, took my pistol, and threatened to kill me.  They must have went back to spirit form and brought the pistol back when I threatened to call the law.\"  And walter, without missing a beat, all but yells \"what the fuck?!\"  and walks out.  So now I know she has some type mental illness.  I told her that since the suspect was in spirit form there wasn't anything I could do, but I would refer her to our \"Paranormal Investigations Division\".  So I get back to my car before breaking down in laughter and call dispatch.   \n\n\"14 dispatch\" \n\n\"14\" \n\n\"Back in service.   Victim referred to Paranormal Investigations.\"\n\n\"10-4?\"\n\nA few weeks later I learned that Linda was a paranoid scitzophrenic who has a history of not taking medication.   Since this call I've found Linda in a lot of places doing things involving the \"spirit form.\"  I always call her daughter and release her to her daughter. So far she's never gotten violent or anything which is a win in my book.",

        "text": "The high-school chapter of mine and my friend's lives were coming to a close. We had a few weeks until we all went off to college and maybe it was the last time we would all be together. During the night in question, late in July, all of us were at a friend's house playing Left4Dead and reminiscing on the many good times we all have had together. We were a relatively mild bunch and rarely got ourselves into trouble... until that evening. Around **3:00am** we decided to go for a drive. We were bored and wanted to find something to do. Windows rolled down we were enjoying the summer night breeze when we saw it. \n\nThe gate to one of our city's natural parks was open. It's a very popular place to go during the day. The park is a beautiful wooded area hugging the banks of a river that goes through our city. There are paths following the river that take you all throughout the area. But tonight... the gate was not closed as it should have been hours before, and it looked mighty spooky. We had a flashlight, lets do it. \n\nWe park in the empty lot, the nearby water treatment plant humming away. Other than that, it was dead silent. We began our trek down the trail. I was in the back carrying the flashlight; shinning it at every twig crack and leaf rustle I heard. It was dark... darker than one would imagine. We neared our destination, a thicket of bamboo that we wanted to convince our terrified selves to enter. I was shinning the flashlight into the tree-tops of the large cottonwood's that made up most of the tree-life. \n\nI was suddenly blinded, it was as if I was starring into a second sun, there was no color left in the trees I was shining my light on, it was washed away. \n\nLiving in a relatively urban area, a lot of sounds become part of the background. This is probably why we hadn't noticed our police department's helicopter making it's way over to us. It was when I was shinning my light into the trees that the pilots decided to activate their spotlight which, though you may have seen one on TV, has an indescribable brightness that you won't understand until you witness it in person. We were caught. \n\nTwo members of our five man party instantly panicked and sought cover under a tree. We didn't was to arouse any more suspicion so we coaxed them out and decided it be best to calmly walk back to the car. As we walked the light stayed on us. The operator occasionally made a sweeps around us with the light. It seemed odd to do so... and someone *had* to open their mouth.\n\n\"You don't think there's someone else out here do you?\" \n\nImmediately I dismissed the question but it sank in slowly that maybe they were searching for an escaped criminal. It made rest of the walk back unnerving, we half expected the spotlight to suddenly fixate on a rampaging PCP-addled convict.\n\nAs we approached the street it was then I remembered I had my \"trusty\" butterfly knife in my pocket... which are illegal in my state. At this point I realized there is a chance I might be in serious trouble.\n\nAs we climbed up the hill, the parking lot came into view. But, to our relief, there were no officers waiting for us. Just as suddenly as it appeared, our prying-eyed guardian angel flipped his light cannon off  and ventured elsewhere... We got the excitement we asked for, maybe a little too much.",

        "text": "Now I've used the probation tag, as I was a probationary officer, meaning I was just out of academy and in a 18 month probation period on the job. So, just about everything then was 'my first' this and that.\n\n\nI was in the car with my partner and it was a nice warm summer's Saturday night. We were driving down to check out the local nightclub near the foreshore, not really tasked with any jobs, just finding something to do in between.\n\n\nWe had pulled up and started shouting at a young guy who thought it would be a good idea to relieve himself against a wall, when we heard shouts over the radio.\n\n\nCurses and screams had come from a car we knew to have been attending to a noise complaint a couple of suburbs inland from us. Without saying anything my partner put his foot to the floor and we peeled out of the car park, leaving the young fella with his old fella in hand and a trickle down his pant leg.\n\n\nA dozen cars immediately started to call out over the radio, asking for the location of the other car and requesting permission to drive under priority to get there. My partner lit us up and we immediately started to fly down the main road in the general direction we knew they were.\n\n\nI didn't bother asking on the radio and pulled their job location up on the computer, mapped our way there and started calling directions. Another unit flew out from a side street to join us on the road, then a third. We wove in and out of this road and that for what felt like forever, while I pieced together what had happened from the radio and job log.\n\n\nA unit had come across an out of control party and kids had poured out drunk into the streets of a cul-de-sac. When our guys showed up they decided it'd be a good idea to hurt some cops, so our mate had caught a bottle to the head and they'd had to withdraw up the street.\n\n\nWe arrived in a cavalcade of local cars and blocked off the road. The neighbors had already started peering over their fences at us and I could hear the kids and their music blaring above everything else.\n\n\nI got out and followed my partner to the rally point that'd been hastily set up, not knowing the names or faces of even half the people there. I was so new I'd never had a chance and they didn't know me from a bar of soap.\n\n\nWe were under strict instruction to stay back from the group of kids and we did so. It wasn't look before our unit that handles public order situations showed up and started kitting up. I was told to stand on the front line, ASP in one hand and my torch in the other.\n\n\nI'd trained for this a month ago in academy, but that was with a helmet and shield and we only had water bottles thrown at us and hoses drenching our shiny new boots. This was the dead of night, there were what seemed like 100 screaming youths in front of me and they were now throwing bricks and glass bottles.\n\n\nI could feel the adrenaline start to pool and have a negative effect on me as I stood still. Another thing they'd taught us about, but I'd never expected anything like this. I noticed the beam of light I was directing on to the kids start to shake, I looked to my left fist and saw that my hand was shaking uncontrollably, I was dismayed at it and brought it to my chest to stop it.\n\n\nThis seemed to work only to have the shakes move through my shoulders down into my boots. It was incredibly unnerving, more so I later realised then the idea of those kids trying to harm me with their under-aged drinking left overs. But at the time a bit of shaking, literally in my boots, was something I could live with if it meant being here to help.\n\n\nK9 showed up soon after, several dogs behind me barking and eager to get to work. Then tactical, with their bean bag shotguns marched past and stood shoulder to shoulder with the public order officers in their full kit.\n\n\nIt felt like forever before we marched in with the helicopter overhead and in the end, it had been. The kids had started to disperse, we chased them one line advance at a time through the night. At one point I rushed to an intersection, stopping with the rest of the line to feel and eerie hot breath down the back of my neck. I turned to see mounted section had shown up as well and it scared the pants off me when the *charged* past me to take the next intersection, barely missing my shoulders.\n\n\nI returned to the car some hours later unable to find my partner in the mess of coppers that now milled around the streets. I caught a lift back to the station with a senior officer and had a chat with her about my goals in the job and her thoughts on the night.\n\n\nI only later learnt that the officer hit originally was okay and returned to duty after a brief stint on non-operational work.\n\n\nThere were no arrests that I know of that night, something that has always bothered me.\n\n\nIt was my first out of control party, it definitely wasn't the last of the summer months and it wasn't the craziest. But I think I'll always remember that moment I saw my hand start to shake and the feel of the horse's breath on my neck.\n\n-sorry this is quite long.\n-happy to change the tag if it's not the correct one :)",

        "text": "There's only been one probation tagged story posted so far and it was received positively so I thought I'd tell you all they story of my first arrest as a probation officer.\n\nI am a felony probation officer working in a small office. I was moved up to mental health officer within 6 months of getting out of basic and had to start making field visits.  \n\nInitially, I had some problems seeing my probationers at home. The previous officer who had the caseload did not go out and see probationers, so why would they abide by their curfews or tell us if they've moved if no one is coming out to check on them? Slowly but surely, my probationers realized I was coming out to see them and would generally be there when I came by. All except one – Lee.\n\nLee was NEVER home. I finally met him one fateful night. My partner, John, and I knock on the door fully expecting him to be out on a lovely Friday night. We were surprised to be told that Lee was home and to wait just a second while his roommate goes and gets him. I'm distracted trying to keep a toddler wearing just a diaper from waddling out the front door when I hear John mutter \"oh shit.\" \n\nOut stumbles Lee who is visibly drunk. We have him step outside and sit down before he falls over. We start off asking if he's had anything to drink tonight and said he had a few drinks. John administers the alco-sensor test and Lee blew a .305. We then asked what he'd been drinking, and he admitted to having a pint of vodka. After confirming with my supervisor, we get ready to arrest him and transport him to the jail. John starts to cuff him and Lee starts pulling away. I take one arm and my partner takes the other and we finally get him cuffed. Then John slaps on the gloves and begins searching Lee. First thing John pulls out of his pockets is a half-finished pint of vodka. Our suspicion was that is was number 2 (at least) for the night. Then your typical cigarettes, lighter, and loose change. The last thing pulled out is a pair of black, lacy, women's underwear. This guy gets PISSED we took his panties and tries to grab them back. While handcuffed with hands behind him. While drunk. It took forever to get him in the car and buckled up, but we were finally on our way to the jail. \n\nThe entire ride to the jail, Lee is spitting all kinds of vitriol at John. John is just laughing his ass off because he used to work in a prison for years and this is nothing to him. Lee focuses his attention on my for a single sentence then goes back to John. I didn't understand what he said because 1) Lee has a very distinctive accent that comes from living in this part of the county. While I grew up here, I was born elsewhere and lived in a town with other transplants so I never really learned how to decipher the accent, and 2) he's drunk as shit. John was laughing too hard for me to ask him what Lee said. \n\nOnce we get to the jail and start through the sally port, Lee starts becoming even more combative. The jail staff is trying to get him booked in and Lee is just not having it. When told to take off his shoes and belt, Lee cries out, “Do you know who I am, I'm Lee Doe! I've been to [notorious prison] at [notorious time]! This ain't shit!” and bucks the jail officer. The jail officer pushes Lee back to where he was sitting and says that if Lee pulls that shit in his jail he's going to get tased. Lee calms down a bit but is still being uncooperative. The jail officer just decides to put him in a cell to sleep it off before booking him in. As I head to fill out the arrest affidavit to hold Lee until I can get a warrant the next day, Lee is screaming that he demands a blanket, a pillow, among all kinds of other things. The jail officer looks at me and says, “Give him ten minutes, he'll be asleep.”\n\nIt took me about three minutes to fill out the arrest affidavit (it being my first and all). By that time Lee was passed out. We finally get back into the car, and John and I look at each other and say, “Yeah, we're done for the night.” \n\nOn our way back to the office, I ask John what Lee said to me. John responds, “Oh yeah, he called you a dirty, old, white bitch.” I busted out laughing because while I am a woman, I'm actually young (and clean!). However, in Lee's eyes that night, I'm sure I was a bitch. ",

        "text": "We all have the medical training needed to provide emergency first aid to those we come into contact with. You may score 100% on the state tests, be an EMT, etc. But until you have actually been first on scene to a serious automobile accident you know *nothing* as I learned.\n\n---\n\n\nPreface:\nI thought I was prepared. I thought I knew what I was going to do. I thought others knew what to do. After all, this is what we had practiced in training: everyone do their jobs and help those who need it most. I checked my medical bag at the start of shift, making sure I had all the essentials (and found out we dont carry C collars).  I thought it was enough.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n---\n\n\nI had just sat down to go on break, got my lunch unpacked and took no more than three bites of the sandwich when a call came over the radio for an accident with injuries: motorcycle down, two people in the road, one not moving. I dont like to take calls while on break. Its my time to relax and vent from what the shift so far has brought, but I knew I had to take this call. I was at most 3 minutes by driving away (only about a minute or so by driving code) and so I took it.\n\nI wasnt first on scene, state and another agency were just pulling up with me when I got there and jumped out of my car with my bag and got to work. Someone had made an illegal turn and T-boned this motorcyclist. Neither riders were wearing helmets.\n\nThey dont teach you in training that there are 1000 things happening at once that all demand your attention: traffic is blocked, people are standing around watching, you got someone trying to tell you what happened, you are doing triage for the two injured, gas flowing everywhere, do i have my gloves on?, wheres medics?, has rescue been started?, who is this guy yelling at me?, whose blood is this?, why is there blood on me?\n\nI was overwhelmed. The only way to relate to this is that you shit your pants and shut down. Not good. I quickly evaluated my situation. Medics arrived quick. They took care of the more serious biker thankfully while I handled the one guy who was in much better condition than the other. I held C-Spine for what felt like an eternity. Rescue arrived with a second rig to help me since I didnt have any other personnel with me. During this time my patient was talking to me and I was talking to him. I remember him saying how we werent going to cut his leather jacket off because it was so special.\n\nFuck that. I got an EMT on scene and they did their job much better than I could do it. I continued to hold C-Spine until someone came over with a C collar that we put on. (among other things).\n\nThen the medics were being nice and allowed us to take his jacket off when we rolled him checking his spine.  All the emergency personnel knew that his arm was broken and his shoulder was fucked up, but he still insisted and since I was no longer the once with the highest training I let others make the call.\n\nWe remove the jacket.\n\nHe starts screeching and crying in pain. And there was nothing we could do.  He wanted it off so we took it off. It had been splinting his broken arm, but since its now gone its free to do whatever.\n\nThey loaded him up. \n\nI sat in my car for a bit just watching the scene as we got everything figured out. I realized that my medical training, while acceptable, was not good enough. I sat there just talking to the guy when I could have been doing DCAPBTLS/ palpating the cervical spine, SAMPLE. For gods sake I never got SAMPLE. I got some of it, but not all of it due to the fact that I was thinking 10000 other things at the time.\n\nI dont care how much training you think you have, until you actually use it in the real world I'm assuming you have none. Because, like me, you will probably shit your pants and not not be as efficient as you could be.\n\n\nI have another story about my first fatal (without shitting most of my pants), but I cant bring myself to typing it out. Its a lot I dont want to remember and out of respect for the families involved.",

        "text": "THAT GUY\n\n(for the purposes of this story, I am going to use the ~~mail~~ male pronoun. By no means is \"that guy\" always a guy. But most of the time, he is.)\n\nEvery academy class has that guy. You know who I'm talking about. He wants to be noticed. He may claim things about his past that aren't true. He speaks when he has no answers. His PT is lackluster at best. He claims extensive firearms knowledge, and then does amazingly stupid things.\n\nThat guy. You're seeing him in your head right now.\n\nNow, for some backstory. In Arkansas, back in the dark ages when I joined, you could be hired by your department and work for a year before you had to attend the academy. And that year-long period could be extended by 6 months with a waiver.\n\nYeah, that's right. It's entirely possible that there was an officer or deputy working the streets for 16 months who has never been to the academy.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnyway, the result of this is that there were many, many trainees who showed up to the academy with a bad habit or two. Or fifty.\n\nSo, let's talk about that guy. For me, his name was Adam. He claimed to have been a Marine scout-sniper in the Gulf, and that he had 12 confirmed kills.\n\nNow, for you kids who know me, you're likely thinking, \"what the hell is DaSilence talking about? Sure, there were TONS of marine scout-snipers in Iraq, and they all had kills!\"\n\nRemember, I attended the academy in the dark ages. For guys my age, if you say The Gulf, you're talking about Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nSo Adam, our resident Marine scout-sniper badass, was going to show us what he knew. \n\nAnd he was going to have his opportunity first up. Our first week of Academy was spent entirely at the range. Weapons drills, shooting technique, mag changes, static shooting (that X is raping your mother, DaSilence! Put that motherf**ker down NOW!), shooting on the move, shooting from your car, etc.\n\nI'm a gun guy, so I thought it was awesome. This was the late 90's, so the Clinton-era gun ban was still on, so I'd never fired an M-16 before, and was looking forward to it. My dad and granddad were awesome men, and they had me shooting shotguns, rifles, and pistols from a young age.\n\nBut I was going to get some first-rate training.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nAnd then there was Adam.\n\nIn every classroom session, he talked and joked and screwed around. Never paid attention, never took anything seriously.\n\nThen we got out to the range for dry fire. Practicing with our issued weapons from our departments (learning trigger control), walking through the range drills, trying to calm nerves.\n\nAgain, Adam took nothing seriously.\n\nThen it was go time.\n\nWe drew our first boxes of ammo, and went to load magazines.\n\nWith full and happy mags, we proceed onto the range for our first live-fire session.\n\n\"Make your weapons HOT and reholster!\"\n\n\"From the holster, 2 rounds, go to the low ready. READY? FIRE!\"\n\nAnd we take our first two official shots of our academy.\n\nExcept for Adam. \n\nAdam puts his hand in the air, a RSO comes over and asks what his issue is.\n\n\"My holster's stuck!\"\n\nMind you, his pistol is out and in his hand.\n\n\"What did you say, trainee?\"\n\n\"Sir, my holster's stuck!\"\n\n\"Trainee, your damn gun isn't in your damn holster!\"\n\n\"Sir, my holster's stuck.\"\n\n\"What the ever loving.... what? What? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TRAINEE?!?!?! GIVE ME YOUR WEAPON AND GET YOUR ASS BEHIND THE FIRING LINE!\"\n\nAdam, our gung-ho semper-fi badass Marine scout-sniper had loaded his rounds into his magazine backwards.\n\nYes, just like [this](http://www.theconservativezone.com/images/hkcat.jpg).\n\nI don't know exactly what transpired after this, but we never saw Adam ever again. From what I've been able to piece together over the years, another instructor pulled him into a classroom to give him a little personal attention, and Adam tried to defend his actions. This kicked off an emergency investigation where it was discovered that Adam had never, in fact, been a Marine, let alone a Marine scout-sniper. \n\nThere may have been a physical confrontation when this was disclosed.\n\nAt any rate, the theme of \"my holster's stuck\" became our class saying. It didn't matter what you did wrong, the instructors would ask you why the hell you can't figure out how to work a damn holster.\n\nLate for something? \"Trainee, did you get stuck in a holster?\"\n\nForget a piece of gear? \"Trainee, did you leave it in your holster?\"\n\nThe guys that taught me at the academy are almost all retired now, but whenever I go down there, I seek out the old timers, and they, without fail, all know the story of Adam the Marine scout sniper and his stuck holster.",

        "text": "For several years I was assigned to a special unit created to combat criminal issues that rose higher than the average patrol cop could handle but still fell short of something that would be worked by the investigations section. On a daily basis, my four-man team (Me, Biggs, Manny, and Landon) would come into contact with hookers, petty dope dealers, low-level gang members, and junkies looking for any way to score. Needless to say, with the direct orders from our higher ups to make every case we could on that crowd, our prosecutors became very familiar with us. \n\nEvery court date would inevitably turn into an all-day event where all four of us would be working deals with defense attorneys (the sentencing guidelines had become second nature to us) and bringing the appropriate paperwork to our assigned state attorney to sign; we were basically legal clerks with badges. \n\nThe dope cases always led to the most headaches when the day arrived to prosecute. It seemed (judging by the defendant’s testimony) that we always went out of our way to violate fourth amendment rights. Somehow, the topic of “granting consent” became cloudy over the month or so between arrest and court date:\n\n“Did the officer ask you if he could search your pockets?” The defense attorney would question.\n\n“Um, like, no?” The defendant would awkwardly lean in and yell into the witness microphone, “I don’t think he did.” \n\nA glance and quick roll of the eyes in my direction from the prosecutor would herald the arrival of another long trial. \n\n Sometimes, the defendant wasn’t even sure what they had in the bag in their pocket was marijuana. \n\n“The baggie that was removed from your pocket – did you know what was inside it?” The defense would ask, knowing full well the story painted by their client was murky at best but served as the last hope of an acquittal.\n\n “Hell no! That might have been oregano or something. I was just holding it for a friend!” Sometimes even the judge seemed appalled by the lack of creativity on behalf of our clients. \n\nOne repeat offender in particular always seemed to put up the biggest fights. Tara, a pretty middle-Eastern girl in her twenties, was the girlfriend of a mid-level dope and guns dealer in the area. We had been trying to get into him for months but somehow every time we ran into the duo, she was always the only one with drugs. The petty possession charges kept coming and over the course of several months, she became more and more agitated with our repeated attempts to upset her and her beau’s criminal enterprise. \n\nWe eventually figured out a way to jam her boyfriend on a hefty federal case and he was sentenced to a multi-year sentence just days before the final possession case we had against Tara came up in court. I had been the unfortunate member of the team to charge her in what would be our last interaction with her and it fell to me to face all her wraith in that final court trial. \n\nGoing in, I knew the prosecutor assigned the case, John, would be on the same page as me. He was one of the regular attorney’s assigned to the criminal courts where my team and I frequently took up our day-long residencies. The case synopsis was simple as I briefed him during a lull in proceedings before our trial was set to begin. \n\n“I saw the car driving on Oak and recognized it to belong to Tara. I realized her passenger was her boyfriend, a guy known to carry drugs and weapons, and followed until I observed a violation. When she ran a stop sign in a residential area, I lit her up and she pulled over. Upon approach to the vehicle, I was greeted by a cloud of marijuana smoke and an angry Tara. She refused me consent to search the car immediately but I informed her she needed to exit due to the fact I had plain smell. Biggs and Manny showed up and assisted me with the two occupants while I searched. I found a smoked blunt in the ash tray and half a bag in Tara’s purse. She refused to take ownership of either so we voiced our intention of issuing summons to both her and her boyfriend. She knew he was on probation so instead of letting him get violated, she then changed her story to say everything was hers. I field tested the weed from the bag using the Narcopouch #908 Duquenois-Levine reagent and it returned positive for the presence of THC. After demonstrating to my standard the fact she wasn’t operating under the influence, she was released on a summons for the weed and warning for the stop sign.”\n\nJohn took in my summary with a glazed over expression of boredom. “So, pretextual but justified stop, plain smell, admission of possession, and leniency on your part in not going for the blood draw and tow her car? Why is this up for trial again?”\n\n“Well, because she hates us.” No other reason came to mind. \n\nThe trial started normally enough. I was called to the stand by John, prompted through the normal introduction and training history, and finally gave my version of the night in question. I took note of the defense attorney nodding along with my testimony and of the sly smile that crept across his face. John concluded his questioning with some clarifying questions in an attempt to shut down the trial quickly. \n\n“When you saw the vehicle being operated on the highway, did you recognize it as belonging to a person with whom you had knowledge was a repeat criminal offender?” He asked.\n\n“Yes.” The key to quality testimony is succinctness. \n\n“And, would you admit that in pulling the vehicle over, you hoped to discover something more serious than a simple moving violation?”\n\n“Yes.” Short and sweet. I caught on, due to the line of questioning, that John was openly validating the fact that the stop was pretextual – a bone of contention for many violators but a perfectly legal technique for criminal interdiction.\n\n“And, upon making contact with the occupants of the vehicle, were you ever granted consent to search the car?” He was chipping away at anything the defense may try to attack.\n\n“No.”\n\n“And why not?” He bore an exaggerated look of confusion, feigning interest in my answer.\n\n“Because I noted the odor of marijuana coming from the car. I had surpassed the plain-smell exception to the warrantless search requirement and knew that consent wasn’t necessary to conduct a search.” I knew the game we were playing and tried to look serious while replying even though John’s reaction was hilarious. As I explained plain-smell he widened his eyes in fake comprehension and bopped his forehead for “being so foolish as to forget it.”\n\nHe looked the judge when I was finished. “No further questions, your honor.” He shrugged and returned to his seat. \n\n“Defense has the cross examination.” The judge said without even looking up from the paperwork on his desk. \n\nThe defense attorney, a tall, middle-aged man I had gone head to head with on several occasions slinked from his seat and strode to the dais in front of the judge. \n\n“So, officer… EMR is it? You readily admit you were targeting my client, harassing her if you will?” He smiled widely, hoping I’d stumble into his pitfall. Instead I looked to John.\n\n“Objection, your honor. “Harassing” implies malfeasance on behalf of the witness.” He rolled his eyes at the defense attorney before sitting down.\n\n“Sustained. Rephrase the question.” The judge wasn’t amused. \n\n“Well, officer EMR, would you admit you had no intention of simply releasing my client on a summons for the stop sign violation that night? That you hoped to dig your way into her privacy and find a reason to charge her with a criminal offense?” I looked past the slimy grin of the defense attorney and implored John to give me guidance with a concerned look. He just sighed, rolled his eyes once more, and nodded back to me. \n\n“I wouldn’t phrase it that way, but yes, I had hopes I would discover a criminal violation.” The defense attorney seemed to grow slightly taller with my answer. \n\n“And, by your own testimony, would you admit that minus your ‘detection of the odor of marijuana’ coming from the car, you would not have been justified in searching the vehicle?”\n\n“Yes. Minus the plain-smell exception, I was denied consent and had no other justifiable means of entering the car.” His phrasing was starting to get to me, even though I had a feeling I knew what his tactic was. \n\n“So, officer EMR, what does THC smell like?”\n\nI paused to search for the right answer, realizing the trap he had laid before me quickly. “I don’t know what THC smells like, specifically. I do recognize the odor of marijuana – the most common way to ingest THC.” I felt I had side stepped the trap well and the slight diminish in the defense attorney’s stature would confirm it. \n\n“Ah. So, you state you know well the odor of marijuana. Describe it for the court if you could.” He waved his hand over the remaining few audience members present in the court room. \n\n“Well, I would describe it as a ‘skunky’ smell, organic, metallic maybe. It’s usually very pungent and different strains have different undertones.” It was a difficult question to answer but I felt I had done it justice.\n\n“And, did you detect those odors in my client’s vehicle that night?” \n\n“Yes.” Keeping it brief again. \n\n“I wonder, officer EMR, if, during your search, you may have noticed any other items within the vehicle that could have given off such an odor? Did you notice my client’s dirty laundry? Or her car air freshener?” The grin was again spreading over the attorney’s face.\n\n“No, not immediately. The first thing I noticed was the half consumed rolled marijuana cigarette in the ash tray. I determined that was the source of the odor I detected. The rest of the search of the car was only done to confirm no other contraband was present.” I couldn’t figure out why he was asking about the laundry.\n\n“So, you admit you didn’t search the car as thoroughly as you could have?” He awaited my reply with raised eyebrows. \n\n“No, I was thorough. There was nothing else of note outside the small amount found in your client’s purse.”\n\nHe smiled, large and toothy now. “Could that ‘skunky’ smell in fact have come from a skunk; either a real skunk in the car that went undetected by you or from the laundry bag that may have contained clothing sprayed by a skunk?” I was dumfounded by the question. \n\n“No?” I answered. The defense attorney slouched and his face bore an expression of contempt. \n\n“Why not?” He demanded. \n\n“Because the odor would have been much more intense. The odor I detected was the burnt marijuana I found in the ash tray.” Was he really trying to deflect my plain-smell with a “skunk defense?”\n\n“Oh, now the odor is burnt? Well, officer EMR, have you ever personally burnt marijuana?” His gaze was all daggers and contempt. \n\n“In the academy they conducted a control burn to-” I began.\n\n“No. Not in the academy. Have you, personally, ever burnt marijuana?!?” He was getting agitated. I looked to John who picked up my distress.\n\n“Objection, you honor. This has no relevance to the case at hand. Officer EMR’s personal experience has no bearing to the case in question.”\n\nThe judge shook his head at the paper on his desk, up to that point totally disinterested with the proceedings. He looked to me, sighed, then to the defense attorney. “I’ll allow the line of questioning as it lends to the credibility of his testimony.” He muttered, annoyed we were taking up his valuable time.\n\nThe defense attorney smiled at me an evil smile as I pondered my answer. Screw it, I had nothing to lose.\n\n“Yes, I did have the opportunity to personally burn marijuana prior to becoming a law enforcement officer. I know firsthand from experience what it smells like.” Now it was the defense attorney’s turn to look dumfounded. I assume he never would have guessed I would own up to having taken a toke and my admission deflated whatever line of questioning he was headed towards. I looked to the judge, hoping he wouldn’t be glaring at me accusatorily. Instead he was smiling at me, a twinkle in his eye indicating he approved of my gutsy confession. \n\n“N-no further questions your honor.” The defense returned to his seat and whispered agitatedly to Tara. \n\n“Your re-direct.” The judge said to John.\n\nJohn stood, straightened his suit, and cleared his throat. “Officer EMR. Just for clarification sake: have you ever smelt the odor of a burnt skunk? As in, the actual animal. Have you ever smelled a burning skunk?”\n\nI fought a laugh and leaned into the microphone. “No.”\n\n“Could you then, with a reasonable level of assurance, be fairly certain the odor you detected at the window that evening was not that of a burning, black and white mammal?” I don’t know how he pulled it off with a straight face but somehow he did. \n\n“Yes. I’m certain the odor was that of burnt marijuana.” \n\nThe judge let loose a chuckle. “That’ll be all. I find the defendant guilty of possession, three months loss of license, thirty days jail time, all suspended, fines of five hundred dollars and court fees assessed.” He punctuated his verdict with his gavel and turned to me. “The skunk expert may have a seat.”\n\nJohn gave me a discreet fist bump as I passed. Tara and her attorney glared at me angrily. I kept my smile to myself and made my way out of the court room towards my next trial.\n",

        "text": "You know, I put out a house fire once.\n\nMy proudest (and only) moment as a firefighter.\n\nIt was when I was working patrol. Cruised through a neighborhood, dead of winter, and noticed that there was an unusual amount of smoke coming from the chimney.\n\nStopped the car, hit it with the pillar light, sure enough, chimney fire.\n\nRadio it in to get the volunteers on the way, make sure my car is parked as far away as possible (for those who don't deal with volunteers, they're awesome people, but their equipment isn't always in the best of shape, and they all drive like they're trying out for NASCAR), and strolled up to the house.\n\nPounding on the front door, yelling \"SHERIFF'S OFFICE, YOUR DAMN HOUSE IS ON FIRE\" for a solid two minutes before they come to the door.\n\nThe lady of the house had made a nice little love nest in front of the fireplace. Pillows, blankets, comforters, etc. It looked cozy.\n\nAnd if she'd bothered to ask her husband, he would have told her that she can't use that fireplace because of a blocked flue, and that he had a company coming out the next week to fix the issue.\n\nBut, he was on a business trip.\n\nSo, there I am, pounding on the door, when the gentleman caller answers the door, all kinds of pissed off. \n\nHe's three sheets to the wind, and was obviously getting some when I interrupted them.\n\nBecause of this, he thought his best possible response was to throw a haymaker at my eye.\n\nFor our gentle readers who know me, you'll imagine that I didn't take too kindly to this.\n\nHe got tased, cuffed, and stuffed in the back of my car.\n\nHe was joined shortly by the 2 dogs and the cat that were residents of said flaming house.\n\nSo, here's the scene: we're 10 minutes after my radio call, I have the lady in her negligee in the front seat, the cursing drunk boyfriend in the backseat with two dogs and a cat that really don't want to share the space with him, and we're still waiting on the fire department to show up.\n\nI used my dinky little issued extinguisher to put out the fire in the fireplace, but the chimney fire is now expanding to a roof fire.\n\nBecause of my steadily-more-panicked calls requesting a status update on the fire department, my sergeant decides he needs to see what's going on.\n\nHe arrives, and now we have him and myself, sitting on the hood of the car, trading snide remarks, while the roof catches even more on fire, with drunky mcdumbass in the backseat raising all kinds of hell.\n\nWe go back to find out what he's pissed off about, and what do we find?\n\nYep.\n\nCaptain in the volunteer fire department.\n\nThis is going to be a fun report.\n\nFast forward another 5 minutes or so, and here comes the big red engine.\n\nUp it pulls into the driveway, and we trot after it, figuring that hooking a hose into a hydrant can't be that tough: I mean, if they can teach a firefighter to do it, surely we can suss it out, right?\n\nAnd who climbs out of the driver's seat?\n\nA girl.\n\nNow, I'm all about equality, and I'm never going to make fun of the ladies who choose the fire service as a career. They're some badasses, and lord knows I'm not willing to run into a burning building, so more power to them.\n\nHowever, this isn't what we got. We got a 19 year old in jeans and a t-shirt who tells us that she doesn't know how to do anything but drive this red monstrosity because she only signed up 2 weeks ago, and this was the first thing they taught her.\n\nSo, Sarge and I head off to the back, grab one of the big hoses, drag it over to hydrant, plug it in, and then connect the other end to what appears to be the \"in\" port. \n\nIt's a good thing they label those terminals.\n\nBut now we have a problem.\n\nWe know how to get the water to the engine, but we have no idea how to make the engine shoot the water out.\n\nIn the distance, red lights approach. Our savoir has arrived! Reinforcements, men and women with skills and training who can dash out this dastardly fire and save the house!\n\nExcept not. \n\nNope, we got a 70 year old man who joined the department in the 1970's, who's feeble arms aren't lifting anything heavier than a cup of coffee.\n\nBUT, he knows how to pull the levers to make the water come out.\n\nHe points and yells, and Sarge and I get the correct hose off a reel on the back of the truck and head toward the fire. He charges the line, and we look at him for advice.\n\nHe looks at us, and in a voice that would make the gnarliest drill instructor crack the tiniest of smiles, bellows out:\n\n\"YOU GODDAMN TIN BADGE WEARING IDIOTS! IT'S LIKE A FUCKING GARDEN HOSE! PULL THE HANDLE, AND PUT THE WET STUFF ON THE RED STUFF!\"\n\nAnd then we put out the fire.\n\nEventually, the rest of the department showed up, and did their firefighter things. \n\nBut the glory was all mine. I put out that damn fire, all by myself. Well, Sarge was there, but he stood way back. He wasn't young and dumb like I was, and didn't want to get wet. It was cold out!\n\nI ended up not filing charges on the dear old captain either. He got booted from the fire department (they're pretty hardcore on that whole morals thing), and I heard through the grapevine that he took a righteous ass-kicking from the man of the house when he got home from his business trip.\n\nAnd I got a pretty good story out of it.\n\nWhat can I say? All in a day's work.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nOh, I forgot, for the BCND crowd... after I got the fire out, I shot and killed both dogs and the cat, found a neighbor who was black and beat him unconscious, and then arrested two people who were legally protesting the fire, and confiscated their cell phones.",

        "text": "\"i h8 this shit... I’m getting too old too keep up with u young boys.” Read the text message. I scowled at my phone, and typed out a response \"Yeah.\" \n\nThis was the fourth text message in the past hour that I received from Mouse, who was sitting in an unmarked just outside the café we were posted in. \n\nMouse was anything but, standing at around 6'3\" weighing around 250 pounds on a good day. He was an old timer, barely touching the beginning stages of \"I've been here too long to care.\" in his long career of policing. He was one of the most experienced members of the force, and hardly thought doing a plainclothes operation for laptop theft was a way to finish out his illustrious career. It was a \"voluntold\" assignment at the last minute due to a spike of snatch and grab robberies out of this particular café, and the desk-jockeys in Investigations felt a plainclothes operation was the best way to catch our thief in the act.\n\nI was lucky enough to play \"takedown\" inside the cafe. The plan was to set up around the entrances and exits of the café and have another plainclothes dump a bait laptop and cell on a table, then “go to the bathroom\" and leave their stuff unattended near the tables that were strewn about the place for students to study. \n\nThe MO was pretty simple: walk in, scope the place, look for unattended gear and walk away with it. If nothing was unattended, a quick snatch of the laptop or phone that was sitting beside the unsuspecting victim followed by a haul-ass out the side door to parts unknown. We were hit at least a dozen times within a month, so naturally we had to catch the guy.\n\nI was busy sipping a nice cold iced tea when the radio crackled in my headphones: \"Ops Three on a personal...\" Silence for a moment, then the unmistakable sigh of the Comm OIC \"10-4, Ops Three.\" This was the third one today. Mouse was definitely wearing on everyone with his small bladder. Without a uniform outside, one of the plainclothes had to switch positions to cover the exterior in his place. \n\nI watched the plainclothes on the far side of the cafe leave his comfortable looking chair and move to the outside, flicking a cigarette in to his mouth. That left that side door uncovered from the interior, which means if our quarry walked past me and moved in to that direction, I'd have to chase him through a sea of tables and chairs to get to the door he'd likely run out of.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, and I flicked it on. \"theres no fuckin tp here. i gotta find some. brb let them know im still on a personal.\" Mouse was stretching his break in search of toilet paper, which means he will be out of action for at least 30 minutes. I texted the Comm OIC to let him know Mouse was taking a dump, and returned to the book I was half attempting to concentrate on.\n\nA few minutes later, Ops alerted everyone that he had a possible on camera along the exterior. I looked behind me towards the big windows and observed the aforementioned peering in to the café from the outside. “Window shopping.” I whispered in to the microphone under the shirt I was wearing. Our target was cupping both hands over his face to see better as he scanned the interior, looking for something to grab.\n\nAfter scoping the interior, our subject moved inside and started to walk around the interior. The side door the plainclothes officer had stepped out was on the other side of the bait we dropped on a small table, and our baddie moved in that direction. I signaled to the other units that he was approaching, and set the remote camera I had placed on top of a bookshelf earlier that day to record. I moved the controller and the rest of my stuff in to my book bag and shifted my weight so I could spring in to action.\n\nThe guy took his sweet time, leisurely pacing around the tables and flashing people waves and head nods, drawing a great deal of attention to himself in the process. I was pretty much ready to scream at him to get on with it when my phone buzzed “I got the tp heading back…” I clenched my jaw at Mouse not running to his post when we had an active subject in the vicinity and stuffed the phone angrily in to my pocket.\n\nJust as I looked up, our perp snatched the bait laptop and phone off the table and took off towards the side exit. I yelled in to my mic that the package was off and the plainclothes unit on the outside of the door sprang in to action. He was a hair too late, as his advance hit the door just as the subject slammed his shoulder in to the crash bar, sending the unit sprawling backwards and on to a table just beside the exit door. I laid rubber on the slick tile, vaulting over a chair and out the side door in a heartbeat.\n\nThe guy had a nice head start on me as I hit open street. His legs were pumping in a flurry of speed as he poured it on heading away from the café towards a busy main street. It was midday, and traffic was just beginning to pick up the afternoon lunch rush. I ground my feet in to the pavement as hard as I could, dodging and weaving pedestrians, and trying to call in updates to Ops OIC for direction of travel. My headphones were a confused crackle of units converging from all angles, attempting to set up a rolling perimeter with plainclothes giving chase, and Mouse advising he was headed towards the subject from the opposite direction. \n\nI lost sight of the subject briefly as he turned a corner, and heard “Stop! Freeze! Gaaaahhh Umph!” followed by the sounds of the PTT clicking and scraping on concrete. Knowing the sounds could only mean an officer just made contact and was wrestling with the perpetrator, I hit the gas again and ran through a gaggle of gawking students on a campus tour. Turning the corner, I nearly laughed at the sight.\n\nMouse was on his back, feet in the air, struggling to regain his balance. In his left hand: a tight grip on the right ankle of our fleeing suspect. In the right hand: a roll of toilet paper. The suspect was desperately trying to free himself from Mouse’s iron grip on his leg, screaming at him “Let me go man! This is my cousin’s laptop! I need to get it to him!”\n\nI wasted no time in grabbing our suspect by the wrist and stretching him out on to the pavement. A backup unit assisted me with cuffing him up and getting him searched. Mouse was finally able to roll himself to his feet, the TP roll still tightly clutched in his arm like a football.\n\nTurns out our suspect turned the corner right when Mouse was returning from acquiring his prize (TP Roll) from another building, and was returning to his favorite shitting spot down the street from where we were posted. The suspect bumped in to Mouse, who immediately reached out to grab him and was pushed down to the ground. Mouse was able to get one hand on him as he was going down, and ended up on his back when the suspect tried to drag away from him.\n\nWe started a transport in our direction, and the ones who were engaged in running took to the side for a breather. Mouse was still clutching his roll of toilet paper, a huge smile across his face. The Ops OIC walked up to him and patted him on the shoulder “I see Operation TP was a success?” Mouse flashed a huge grin, his front gold tooth glistening in the afternoon sun. “Yup! Now if you boys are done playing ‘Po-leese’, I have to drop the Brown’s off at the Superbowl.” And he sauntered off.",

        "text": "The tall teenager I was watching looked nervously about before quickly crossing a street and half jogging, half speed-walking up the sidewalk, presumably in the direction of his destination. From my vantage in the old folk’s home a block away, I could only barely make him out with the use of my binoculars and a second later, her turned a corner and was gone. I’d have to reposition. \n\nI pulled my silver unmarked Crown Vic out of the parking space (perfect cover, there in the old folk’s home – lots of big bodied American vehicles) and edged in the direction my quarry had been hurrying. As I pulled up to a gas station just a few hundred yards away, I spotted him again – his goofy gait combined with the comically large backpack strapped to his gangly frame made him stand out. He again gave a quick scan of his surroundings, missing me by some stroke of luck, and crossed the street again. \n\nI had been told about this target by an informant I had developed on a traffic stop. I had popped the guy for driving on a suspended license and a small amount of weed and discovered a strange blend of some unknown-to-me organic material that I later learned was K2/Spice. Rather than face the music himself, the guy gave up the local chemist who was pushing out the designer drug to the locals. After some discussion with some buddies on the narcotics unit, it was agreed that I would work the case up to a bigger fish and, if they felt like it, they would take over from there. Such is the life of a road dog struggling to make a name for himself. The drug was still too new to garner much attention from a unit struggling with daily search warrants resulting in seizures of kilos of cocaine and pounds of marijuana. \n\nMy guy, now safely across the street, began to slow his pace and scan the cars parked in a lot by a row of townhouses. I felt like my sneaking around was about to pay off when the simultaneous combination of tones from my radio and computer pulled my attention away. \n\n“4Alpha60, 3Alpha30, start for a CPR in progress, fire requests assistance due to LOI. Complainant states a female student has stopped breathing, CPR instruction have been given. Eleven-oh-three hours.”\n\nTypical: just when I’m about to strike gold I’m being sent to a call. I glanced once more at the lanky guy with the backpack. He was now standing still, looking up and down the street at the passing traffic, still oblivious to my presence. \n\nI pulled into traffic and started towards my destination – a private school catering to kids with emotional and learning disabilities that were bussed in from neighboring districts. It was a spot notorious for generating complicated cases involving juveniles who were used to disrespecting authority and a school administration worried about their public image and a propensity to not cooperate with police. Not a good combination. \n\nI pulled up well before my backup arrived but right behind the ambulance. The doubled-up EMT team seemed to be taking their time unpacking their equipment and they were happy to see me walk up – apparently the fire department had their own negative feelings about the place as well. We walked in and were greeted with a sight we had not expected: one of the administrators was actively engaged in chest compressions, panic on her face when she looked up to us for help. \n\nThe EMTs sprang into action, quickly moving the woman out of the way and assuming the positions to take over CPR. One leaned down and felt for breathing while feeling the girl’s neck for a pulse. A look of surprise sprouted on his face and he looked up to the administrator with an accusatory scowl. \n\n“She’s breathing! She’s got a pulse! Why were you giving her chest compressions?!?” \n\n“I don’t know, the lady on the phone said… I should…” Her voice trailed off and she looked to the other faculty standing around for support. \n\n“Did you check her before you started?” The EMT asked. \n\n“Yes. I mean, I think so. I’m not sure.” She looked as though she was about to cry.\n\n“Well, she might have some broken ribs now…” The EMT let the phrase hang in the air as he again turned his attention to the teenager on the ground. The other EMT was already feeling for other vitals while his partner was berating the administrator. I walked over to her to ask a few questions. \n\n“What was she doing before she became unresponsive?” I asked her. \n\nShe looked to me, about to answer, when she recognized me. “You! You were here when Tommy was arrested!” \n\nI remembered well the event she was speaking of. A few weeks prior I had been one of several cops dispatched to a weapon complaint at the school. Tommy, a particularly violent and antiauthoritarian example of “student,” had brought a large hunting knife to school with him which was found when he tried to pass through the metal detector at the front entrance. Upon the seizure of his prized possession, he went into a rage and grabbed a large pair of scissors before fighting his way into his classroom and barricading himself behind several pieces of overturned furniture and threatening to kill himself and anyone else that came near him. \n\nAt the time, Ned was training a then-rookie Stan, and the scenario provided the perfect opportunity to test his mettle in a time of duress. After several minutes of painfully inept attempts on Stan’s behalf to coax Tommy out of the room, Ned eventually became irritated by the lack of success and, with the exclamation “Aw, fuck this!,” commenced a charge and “pig-pile” on top of the would-be suicide-by-scissor victim. The few seconds of struggle resulted in him being pepper-sprayed, handcuffed at an awkward and painful angle, and carried out of the school with a rip-hobble in place to prevent any further violence. A spit shield and cranked up country music radio station dulled his tirade enough for Stan and Ned to transport him to the detention facility.\n\nThe administration was irate at how we handled the situation, insisting we should have gone in and talked with the student in a non-threatening manner to resolve the standoff without violence. It was odd hearing such a poor excuse of Monday morning quarterbacking come from the bloodied-by-her-student maw of one of Tommy’s “refuse-to-press-charges” school officials. The IA case was still in full swing when I again met the woman who had filed it. Needless to say, she wasn’t happy to see me. \n\n“There will be no arresting of *any* of my students today!” She exclaimed, as though that was somehow my goal. \n\nI gave her a, “I’m concerned for your mental health” stare and let the silence following her outburst linger uncomfortably for a moment before replying, “It’s not illegal to lose consciousness.”\n\nShe huffed and turned away, apparently not willing to answer my earlier question. \n\nI went to assist the EMTs as my backup finally walked in. It was Ned, and his presence didn’t go un-noticed by the woman who had previously been breaking her student’s ribs. She huffed a contemptuous laugh and turned to a woman standing nearby.\n\n“There’s another one of the thugs who are here to ‘serve and protect.’ I don’t know why I even call 911 anymore.”\n\nNed looked up at her, his scowl and twitching mustache hinting at the rage he was barely containing. “Nice to see you too, ma’am.” He said, the sarcasm of it palpable. \n\nOne of the EMTs addressed me. “I think she’s faking it. The last three that did this here were transported to the hospital. I bet this one wants the same.” He considered his patient with a contemptuous gaze. \n\n“Can I try a trick I learned?” Ned asked.\n\n“Sure?” The confused EMT replied. \n\nNed gripped the girl’s wrist and raised her hand to arm’s length above her head. He let it drop and the hand at first fell limply towards her face, only to avoid striking it at the last second. \n\n“See! How cool is that? If they’re faking, they’ll never hit themselves in the face! I do this to drunks all the time to make sure they’re not dead.” He raised her hand again to repeat the experiment. The second time was slightly different than the first. The girl’s hand fell as it had before, limp and directly towards her face. This time, however, it didn’t veer away. Instead, there was a loud SMACK and the hand came to rest against her nose, her eyes twitching to reveal her trickery. \n\n“And see! If you tell them how it works, and they are smart enough to put two and two together, the second time they actually hit themselves!” Ned stood up and wiped his hands with pride as he beamed at the adults standing around the room. “I guess this is your problem now, ma’am!” He nodded in the direction of the principal who had a mixed expression of confusion and admiration before exiting the school. \n\nThe principal rushed to the side of the still prone girl while the EMTs packed up their things. “Lisa! Lisa, honey, are you ok?” She gently wiped the hair off the girl’s face while she stared at her with passionate eyes. The girl slowly began to “gain consciousness.”\n\n“Wh-where am I?” She stammered in an obviously overdramatic and shaky voice. \n\n“You’re safe, sweety, here in school.” You would have thought the girl had just recovered from a near fatal gunshot or some rare form of cancer judging by the tender way the principal cradled her head and smiled radiantly at the still-on-the-floor student. \n\n“I… I still want to go get some food. I’m… I’m so hungry.” She looked into the eyes of her principal pleadingly while I suppressed the rage generated by her disclosure of why she was wasting all of our time with this farce. \n\nThe EMT had presumably reached his BS quota too. “Are your ribs hurt?”\n\nThe student turned to him. “No… I feel ok. Can you drive me to McDonald’s?”\n\nHe sighed in response, shaking his head as he rose to depart. “I think we’re done here.” \n\n“I just want a burger! I’m hungry! Why won’t you let me leave!” She turned back to the principal. “I’m gonna starve here, bitch! You let Mikey leave yesterday!”\n\nBut Mickey had a note from his mom. You don’t and even if y-”\n\n“Shut up! You’re a bitch and I hate you!” The girl sprang to her feet and stomped off into the classroom. I didn’t linger long enough to confirm nothing was does to reprimand her for her heinous behavior, but I presumed she walked away unscathed. \n\nI drove back to my post at the old folk’s home and waited again for my target to come into view, thankful I was done with the school for the day and happy to have a guy like Ned around to cut though the BS calls with the precision of a brain surgeon. \n",

        "text": "It's kinda slow in here... /u/el_mono_rojo I want some stories...NOW!\n\nAnyway here's another short story from Russia. One of my mother's friends (they went to high school together) was in the 8th month of her 3rd pregnancy about 5 years ago. Like many people in Russia they have a \"Datsha\" outside of the city in the countryside. A Datsha is basically a vacation property, they come in all shapes and forms. Some people use them to grow some food, others purely for recreation. Her's was mostly for recreation, they had just finished building a brand new cottage and sauna. \n\nAnyway it's located about 120km outside of Moscow and to get there she takes one of the major highways out of the city. Back then she drove a black boxy SUV with tinted windows.\n \nAs she's driving on the highway she is waved out by a young rookie cop standing on the side of the road beside his car. She pulls over grabs her papers and gets out. As soon as this young rookie cop sees that she's heavily pregnant he gets a frightened look on his face and tells her to just get back in her car and drive away. She obliges, and spends the weekend at her datsha.\n\nNext weekend she decides to go up again, and drives along the highway again, and is again waved out by the same rookie cop. She once again grabs her papers and gets out. The rookie sees her, recognizes her and basically starts pleading for her to get back into her car and drive away. She starts laughing but gets in and goes on her way. \n\nOur guess was that the rookie was so inexperienced he didn't want to have a potentially angry pregnant women on his hands (not that she's the type to get angry at anyone). It did supply us with a good laugh over the dinner table...ofc the vodka's the adults had all drunk made the story funnier.\n\nWow that was longer then I expected it too be.\n\n",
