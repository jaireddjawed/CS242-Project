        "text": "A friend from high school (almost a decade ago) who I don’t talk to anymore shared about the sudden impending death of her family member, who was also one of my hs athletic coaches that I really looked up to.\n\nI don’t think attending the funeral is warranted after so much time. Unless they expressly state they want all to come. It seems way too personal. They’re a very tight knit family and I know that I would be/feel out of place. \n\nI have no idea if they will ask for funeral donations or for supporting the family. I’m hoping they do, and I can show support that way. But if not, I’m wondering what other things could possibly be arranged that are not too intrusive or out of place? Maybe there will be a meal train - the problem is that I live pretty far away. Although my mom still lives there and could maybe drop off a meal, if I gave her money and asked. Obviously I’d only do that if a meal train was organized though.\n\nMaybe just keeping them in my thoughts is the most appropriate thing. I’m not good at grief situations or showing support in a manner that’s not accidentally over- or under- doing it.",

I am from Romania.\n\nI go to college and most of my friends don't, they work either here or in another country.\n\nThere is a friend that I considered a really good friend, until he started hanging out with only people who party and get drunk often.\n\nWhen I was his only friend he used to ask me if I can hang out really often. I don't have a car so he would always come to me with his (5km ride, sometimes he did it twice), and feeling bad for him always comingI often gave him some money.\n\nHe will soon go in another country to work and didn't think to see me, and I told him that we should see each other one more time at least. He started saying that gas is at a high price and he can't always hang out. Every 2/3 days I see this new friend of him who lives near him post stories of them together, in clubs or his car.\n\nI also had another good friend who used to ask me to hang out often, and even with him I still gave him the money for the ride when I could.\n\nThe friend I go to college with has another best friend, it feel like all of his \"friendship\" is just an excuse so he doesn't have to pay the apartment alone.\n\nI felt like I had some good friends but as time goes on I feel like I have none.\n\nI always am positive and I can say I am pretty charismatic, they like my presence, but is status more important?\n\nJust because almost everyone of them has a car and I don't means I am the one who gets respected less, even though I always respect others?\n\nThe first friend I talked about said that he feels reallt stressed and kind of depressed, so everytime we hanged out I would always talk with him and try to comfort him, even though I have a lot going on for me, he never asked me how I was or tried to help me. I always thought that it's pointless to ruin the mood talking about my life and instead try to help other.\n\nI don't even know what I am doing bad, really, it feels like everyone goes behind the personthey see as most valuable, and not the ones who give them value. \n\nI don't really know why this happens, if you have any advices I would really be grateful!",

        "text": "For the past year and a half, I’ve been best friends with a guy at my school. Really cool dude. He’s my only real friend.\n\nBut I’ve started to realize something which is… he never texts me. I can go a whole week without texting him and he’s indifferent, but it slowly kills me on the inside to not talk to him. I think this may be part of his ADHD, as I’ve heard that people just *don’t text* or forget to if they have ADHD. So I haven’t been blaming him for not texting me; I get that not everyone works the same way. \n\nI still text him almost every day, but he hasn’t texted *me* more than twice in the year and a half I’ve had his number. Maybe that’s the problem; he’s gotten used to me initiating conversation, and doesn’t even think to reach out. But it still hurts and feels like he doesn’t care. \n\nHe’s not a bad friend; he’s a good listener, and we share a similar wavelength. But I just sometimes feel like I care about him way more than he does me (though this is partly true. He’s my best friend, but I think I’m far from being his) \n\nI’ve just kept assuming that “Oh, he’s probably just busy or something” which may be true sometimes, but it just feels like… it’s kinda ridiculous that he’d never find the few minutes in his day to text me. \n\nSo I have a few questions:\n\n1. Should I bring this up to him? I really don’t want to seem clingy and lose him. He’s really the only friend I have in my life right now.\n\n2. If I do bring it up, how?\n\n3. If I don’t bring it up with him, how can I cope? I don’t want to feel alone all the time. \n\n4. Title\n\n5. Am I too clingy/needy? And how can I fix this/cope with it?",

Like, I'm totally chill with public speaking, I'm totally cool about approaching strangers and making conversation, I love being the center of attention, back at my old school I was often the life of the party and I really enjoyed my role, I can pretty reliably carry conversations with people as long as im mentally prepared, and I only ever really get toungue tied when talking to people I want to be friends with (this is literally it, i dont even have trouble talking to a cute girl in my class, albeit about non romantic stuff)\n\nbut its weird cause it's almost like im immune to social cues. i don't even notice that stuff i did was probably socially unacceptable (yelling really loudly during class, being late to places, talking loudly about politics, ironically saying something anti-vaxx but not giving any indication that i'm being sarcastic, and a thousand others i probably missed) until other people point it out, or much later after the fact (usually 2 or 3 days) after ive analized the conversation in my head a few times.  \n\nits been like this for as long as i can remember. when i was younger i was fine with this, it's why i used to take on the role of being the class clown a lot, because it was the only way i could get people to interact with me at school, but now that i'm older it's really getting in the way of making meaningful friendships \n\nim starting to think there might be something about me that's inherently off putting, i attend a dnd after school club at my school, and after my first day there everyone seems like theyr're really keen on not interacting with me and trying to be subtle about it\n\nI guess there are a couple\n\ni've been slowly building up a list of all the stuff i think im doing (fidgeting really noticeably, laughing too hard at dumb stuff, sitting weird, not making eye contact with people, looking around the room randomly for seemingly no reason, nodding/shaking my head/bounding in my seat for no reason, silently muttering my thoughts to myself) but its hard for me to concentrate on not doing all of that and also on the conversation. \n\nmaybe i should just stop going to the after school club and just not interact with anyone more than necessary so i don't make anymore of a fool of myself \n\nthe weird thing is im otherwise super self aware-to a weird extent, i mean. i am usually hyper-aware of every other aspect of my personality.",

Without going into too much detail I pretty much wasn't well-socialized and didn't get taught how to interact with others correctly. \n\nThis has always led me to struggle with forming new relationships of any kind. While talking to my friends they stated that I come off as intimately confident, also giving off the vide that I didn't like to be approached. Combined with the fact I'm very blunt and direct with them which they found very intimidating at first. \n\nIt wasn't until they got to know me more that they considered me to be quite friendly, understanding and open. When speaking to my best friends of 7ish years they said the same they just didn't have the words at the time. They also stuck around as my 'genuine couldn't careless attitude was so refreshing', to them. \n\nThe problem is, I've found myself in a position where I'm usually excluded right off the bat for 'not being nice enough'. Or making people too uncomfortable that they don't want to talk to me further. \n\nI am currently seeing a therapist to work through my childhood issues and would like a few additional perspectives if you have the time. Thank you. \n\nNote: I apologise for the spelling and grammar. I'm not the best at it.",

But sometimes I can still be so damn awkward and eats away at me..\n\nI had a pretty toxic childhood and my circumstances at the time meant I missed out any peer interaction from 16 to 19 and was a lil behind even before that so my self esteem aint the best and I'm aware i'm playing catchup, plus I didn't grow up fully in my country and still have issues expressing myself in the language at times. Its just like sometimes I can be super fun and charismatic while other times i'm a total wreck who's way too hyper aware and can hardly string a sentence together,  I try not define myself by it but it kinda cuts deep when people occasionally point it out...\n\nWhats the way forward from here? Is it just a case of time and persistence? I got into therapy recently and its certainly helping a little but its a big insecurity of mine and I guess I'm a bit impatient..",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/110ynti/why_do_friendships_relationships_have_to_be/",
        "text": "I'm an introverted college student (20) who only really makes 1-2 very close friendships within usually a 2-4 year span at a time, with a handful of mutuals to make small talk with on the side. It's come to my attention after talking to my friends that they viewed all friendships as a 'come and go' phase, and that was extremely hard to process for me because I could never view any of them or anyone close to me as someone 'temporary.' They obviously didn't have any harmful intention behind that one statement during our long conversation regarding relationships, but it's hard not to take it personally when it makes me feel 'replaceable' despite all of the love and support we show each other every day.\n\nI understand the concept of friendships being 'temporary' because everything is temporary in life. I just have such a deep emotional attachment to my 2 friends since we've grown extremely close due to living with each other for the past 2 years, and we have so much fun every day just doing daily things with each others company like cooking dinners, talking, grabbing breakfast, saying goodnight, going to the gym,, etc. However, it's all coming to an end within a few months, and I worry about the inevitable of us drifting apart since we won't be in a convenient environment where we see each other so often. And that's exactly what I dread- the possibility that the lack of time spent together will eventually drift us apart and make us nothing more than another 'temporary' friendship- and will possibly lead to my other 2 friends moving on to finding new 'main' friend groups. I guess I have this stupid fear of being left alone as a result of such a drastic change in my current lifestyle which I've grown comfortable and fond of. I guess I've let myself grow too attached to them, but how could I not? They're remarkable people, and I feel so lucky to call them my friends.\n\nAnyways, I've just been genuinely wondering why people think that friends are all 'temporary' and not an important friendship that could potentially develop into a lifelong one given that both put in the time and effort? Or maybe that's the issue- I sort of think of my closest friendships as almost 'platonic relationships'- (to elaborate, basically the mindset of wanting for your lover to stay in your life side by side forever, but in this case there's no romance involved- just us as close friends staying side by side forever.) I like the idea of my friends and I staying super close and comfortable for a long time as opposed to what i've learned is the norm:  'friends come and go' because 'it's unrealistic' to expect to life this sort of life when we graduate and become adults in the real world.. \n\nI don't know, I just guess I have this 'unrealistic' dream of wanting to continue this comfortable lifestyle as a newly independent adult where I see my friends and have good company. I don't believe I'm aromantic, if anyone pops the question- I very much would love a partner, but I just dont necessarily am in active search for one because I have the perfect amount of company in my life right now\n\nAnyways, I was just wondering if anyone with more life experience than me can give me some advice or personal stories that might relate to mine, anything really. Please try to be kind and respectful :) thank you.",

        "text": "I’m currently 19 years old and about to turn 20 in a few weeks. Turning 20 is pretty scary and I know that I really want to get my life together so I can have a good future for myself. This also isn’t a new idea to me. I’ve been working on myself and making huge changes is my life for the past few years and I’ve made so much progress with myself. Currently I work full time at an autobody shop and so far I’m really liking it. It’s not a lot of money right now but I’m learning as much as I possibly can by paying close attention to what everyone else is doing and focusing on the tasks I’m given at work. I also hit the gym 5x a week consistently and have some friends that I workout with there. I also race motorcycles on the weekends during the warmer weather and have been doing so for the last 5 years. I also am trying starting to do more car detailing/ paint correction on the side as I have created a little shop for myself in my home garage and I really enjoy it. I got a handful of customers last year during the summer but I have plans to try to take it more seriously this year to make more money. One of my biggest goals is to own my own shop in the future where I essentially have a car care business for things like details, repainting, window tints, ppf films etc., while still maintaining my hobbies I have like racing motorcycles for example. I’m always listening to podcasts and learning things everyday to expand my knowledge. I didn’t go to college after highschool because I wanted to get work experience trying to figure out what I’m interested in and I’m really feeling like I have a solid plan for my future. The problem is my closest friends that I grew up with since I was very young are starting do things that I’m not very interested in and I feel like we are on completely different paths. All my friends want to do is smoke weed all the time and go to college parties with this other kid that’s a part of our group which I had done a few times but it’s just not exactly my idea of fun. They seem to have zero direction in their life and don’t have any goals. My friends who go to college just smoke and drink all the time and are in classes they could care less about. All they focus on is girls and fun. My other friends works with his dads business but only does it because it’s the easiest route he could take. I know that sounds super critical of my friends but it’s true. I’m seeing them become lazier people and even they way they talk is just degenerate. They say things like “fire” “that’s so gas bro” “ode” and it just makes them seem ignorant. They also don’t even act normally in public they just act so childish like they are 15 years old. Sometimes they even start making fun of me and even around other people by making stupid jokes and it really seems to stem from their own insecurities. It just really bothers me because I have know them for years and we have so many memories together. We haven’t always had the same interests but growing up we were still able to have such good friendships every time we hug out. I don’t want to lose these people from my life but it’s almost as if I see myself outgrowing them and maturing faster than them. There are still things we can do together that I enjoy like working out at the gym and maybe having a smoke here and there or having little gatherings with friends but I just really want to focus on my future and they seem to be holding me back. I used to be extremely socially anxious but I have since almost overcame that anxiety. But the idea of trying to make new friends really scares me. I do have some other friends outside of them but I don’t feel like I can connect with them as well or some of my anxiety creeks back because I’m not as comfortable with them. I know what it’s like to have no friends in the past and I don’t ever want to go back to that. But I genuinely really see myself growing apart from my closest friends. If anyone else has had a similar situation what would you do? Or how would I go about communications to my friends that I enjoy spending time with them but I also need time to really focus on my future?",

Again, not a huge deal, but whatever I text her, it's just one word answers or when I ask a question, she leaves me on open. \n\nI kinda confronted her because this isn't the first time she did this. She ignored me and said that she wasn't angry and that I wasn't bothering her, but she continued to not talk to me. On her snapchat story, she often lists those she put on her best friend list, and I'm no longer there. She posted another story with her old best friend list and then marked it up, saying she needed to \"replace\" some people. Again, meanwhile, she's normally messaging other people. \n\nIn person, it's not any better. She gives me one word answers and pretends not to hear me when I ask her a question. I no longer ask her what's wrong because all she says is, \"fine\" and then leaves it at that. She no longer asks how I'm doing or how my day is. I have no problem with her having other friends. Hell, I know that we're not even best friends, at least not anymore. It's just so jarring to go from her saying she loves me everyday and to not even considering me a \"good\" friend anymore.",

I can too, but I often feel kind of guilty playing games for long periods of time...I figure I could be doing something more productive.\n\nI like maybe 2 hours whereas on weekends I see him on like the entire day.\n\nThe point is, when I feel like it's time to get off, I hesitate to say anything. I'll be like \"are you good to save?\" instead of \"Alright, I'm going to hop off.\"\n\nI would at least give him a chance to finish anything he's doing.\n\nIn retrospect, he has basically never asked me if I'm good to save. He'll always be like \"Alright, I'm going to save.\"\n\nI need to be like that. I mean I'm fine giving him another 10 minutes to finish something.\n\nI should also just say \"No\" sometimes when he asks me to play. He wants to play today, and I'm fine with that, but I am pretty tired and would like to go to bed before midnight.\n\nHe, on the other hand, has off tomorrow and would probably go to like 2.\n\nI also freelance, so I make my own schedule. So, it feels like he doesn't have respect for me if I set a time limit, like my work isn't as \"real\" as his work, although I'm sure that's not what he means at all.\n\nBasically, I want to be able to dictate how I use my own time.

Ever since I was very young, I've always been socially anxious about talking to people in school and it's carried into adulthood which led me to isolate myself and I only have very few friends in my life. I've missed out on those early 20's carefree years of socializing, going out with friends, having a great time going on trips, stuff like that. I can still do that, but I worry that I'm now 26 that things are not the same as people have their careers and life together.. while I'm going back to college it's not going to be the same. I dealt with mental health stuff which is the reason why I'm fallen behind in my professional and social life or lack their of.. I've never dated because of it as well. Now that I'm doing better mentally then I did a few years ago, having a job and going back to college in March which I'm excited about, but I just don't want to be dealing with regrets and feeling at times really sad about those lost years and feeling my youth is winding down. I still want to make time for it. The question is how do I make friends and not let the feelings of regrets get to me? Thanks everyone!",

        "text": "Pretty much the title, I break the ice with most people I don’t know through joking with them, which usually works out fine but I don’t know how to proceed afterwards. \nI get along with most people but get a bit anxious around people I’m not close to so I usually maintain this sort of joking/teasing friendship with most people. Thing is I’ve noticed that I have few close friends because of this so I’d like to connect to people more outside a joking context. As far as getting to know people goes, I usually run out of things to say once general topics are out of the way (Interests, family, job, education, etc)\nAny tips would be appreciated, thanks!",
