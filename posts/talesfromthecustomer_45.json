        "text": "You're not always going to have the best service. I know this and, and I always try to give them the benifit of the doubt, maybe they're tired or having a a bad day, or really swamped or stressed. Most of the time its not a big deal, and I always make sure to tip well, because I know that these people basically live off of the tips. This time though, she was just plain bad in every aspect.\n\n\nMy wife and I had decided to go out for dinner with our young son. We were pleases to see that the place was pretty empty, which was unusual for the time and location. \n\nWe were sat immediately, but it was a good 15 minutes before our waitress showed up. She came over to talk to the table next to us, and laughed at a joke they said, but when she turned around, she was completely stone faced. She didn't greet us or introduce her self, she just stared at us, with her note pad in hand. After several moments, I greeted her, and she didnt respond, so I just gave her our drink order and she left without a word. \n\n\nI should mention that the booth we were sitting in, was on the other side of the drink station. It took her about ten minutes to get our drinks, because she was talking to another waitress about her boyfriend. When she came back, she was all smiles and friendly, a big difference from the woman who had silently stared us down before.  She gave my wife a water, and told her the shake she ordered would be out later, pretty standard. She took our order, and i ordered a burger with no mayo (i hate mayo. Even the smell makes me sick) and she confirmed it. When our food came up (we were also next to the kitchen window), it sat in the window for a minute while our waitress talked to another. The waitress she was talking to pointed to it and said \"i think your foods up\". Our waitress walked over, looked at it and said yeah, ill get it in a minute and walked off. She walked by our food several times. A different waitress stopped her to tell her that the order was up and she just grumted out an uh huh. Finally a manger stoped her and made her pick it up. He told her \"look, if youre having trouble covering your table, we can get you some help. She assured him she was fine and handed us our food.  \n\n\nMy burger had mayo on it, so I politely told her that, and she argued that I didnt ask for it without, in a crappy a oyed tone of voice. She also hadn't brought my wifes shake, amd said shed bring it out with the new burger. When she brought out the new burger, she didnt bring the shake. My wife asked her about it again, and her response was \"oh do you still want that. Theyre kind of a pain to make\"\n\n\nThe rest of the meal, she didnt come by or offer us refills. At this point I was pretty angry and decided to talk to the manager when we paid the bill. He said he wasnt suprized  and they had complaints about her before. He apologized and comped the meal for us.\n\n\nBonus tales! \n\nI was went to a fancy Italian place with my wife on a date night. Our waitress stood about 3 feet away from us and told another server that one of the guys was being a total jerk, and she was going to fart in his food. My wife and I had a laugh at that, and when she brought our food, I said \"I hope you didnt fart in this\" she was absolutely mortified that we had heard her, and begged us not to tell her boss, and that it was a joke. I told her i knew it was a joke and i wouldn't say anything. ",

        "text": "Whenever I read dialogues of the antagonistic lady customers from retail stories, a loud, harsh voice with irritating intonation echoes back. A voice that immediately indicates 'fiery foreigner', which was probably an impression left by a crotchety native English-speaking teacher, who I had to listen to several times a week for a whole school year. Ever so^( inappropriately) stereotypical, but I love to imagine that sometimes. It adds to the jokes.\n\nNever would I ever think about seeing one with such a voice scoffing at a retail worker in real life. They seem to be such a rare sight around here.\n\nLast night a portly blonde lady customer at a health and cosmetics chain retailer was conversing with a female employee and somehow managed to gather a small audience of three or four. Meanwhile, Dad was searching for an ointment at the same end of the aisle, but ended up empty-handed. Mom had told me to reach him so we could leave the store if we found nothing suitable.\n\n\"Here goes nothing,\" I thought. I walked up and said 'excuse me' loud enough over the woman's head. She did move aside (props to her), and I did pass through, but my backpack hit a loose nail off of a nearby display shelf.\n\n\"Oops, silly me.\" I picked it up and attempted to screw it back on. It was without success, but it gave me time to get a load of the exchange between the women, and it was not as pleasant as I thought. It went roughly like this:\n\n&gt;I buy this very often, it's a **very common medicine**!    \n&gt;*cuts off employee* [something something] \"need reading glasses\" (not a product of the store)?    \n&gt;I talked to the other girl earlier about that!\n\nPoor employee couldn't fully follow. She was trying hard to explain to the woman in her best English (she was far from bad actually, but needed time to digest the words), that she possibly didn't know the woman was mocking her here and there. I hope she didn't receive a complaint.\n\nWithout full context I cannot assume the employee was not at fault for failing to deliver the desired product. Nevertheless, things could be much easier to handle. When language barriers are that obvious, I don't think that attitude is going to help.\n\nTo quote Murphy from Rayman 3, don't be so touchy. It saves time and your 'liver fire' too.\n\n**TL,DR**: Rare sight of 'novice' form of popular female adult antagonist of retail stories. Not sure if she got what she wanted. Dad thinks she's simply trouble.\n\nEdit: I some words. Also added TL,DR.",

To be fair this game store is not like others that make you wait along the counter. Instead you have to wait a considerable distance from the counter in front of the register.

The clerk looks at me and starts examining the disc. I tell him it doesn't work maybe because of the huge circular scratches along the disc. He proceeds to tell me he wants to let me in on a little secret. That those scratches don't matter and only the clear part in the middle and scratches that reach the metal from the other side do. Then gives me a smug ass little know it all smile. The fool who was trying to skip people agrees, and says yeah i was just about to tell him that. I used to work in a game store and repair game disks for a living, but okay, i just shake my head, get the new game and leave ",

Manager had (apparently) agreed to sell burgers to them for 7 cents each, and told them to come in and get them. She came in and asked for her 7 cent burgers (which actually cost $4.95 each) and was told that is not possible. She then launched into a tirade about how we are all racist dogs.\"\n\nMe: Oh...my...lord...\n\n\nFacepalm #1: Nobody in the world gets 7 cent burgers.\n\nFacepalm#2: Racism is relevant to RACE. Nothing else. At all. So grow up.\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry guys, I should have mentioned the fact that the manager had never spoken to these customers at all.  They made up the conversation, as a ploy to get their burgers for 7 cents. No manager would say something like that, over the phone, in person or otherwise.",

I was waiting at the shop while he was getting everything packed onto a truck at home with some people he had hired to do so. (He's less than 5 feet tall, and his strength isn't that great either.) \n\nSo the truck pulls up in front of the shop. We've removed the door so we can get the machinery through the door. \n\nDad's grunts start to get out of the car, and I hear them say. \"We've gotta move this shit again... For this asshole.\" I'm confused. *My dad can be a jerk, but he's never done it to anybody outside of family.* They start to unload the machinery, swearing and cursing and trying to get a few tons of machinery out of that truck and onto dolly (which snaps).\n\nNow the workers are pretty pissed. My dad was standing in the middle of the room with his clipboard, yelling at the men that they were screwing up his \"perfect store\" and that they were doing it wrong. He kept trying to teach them how to do simple things, like lifting a table and rolling a dolly and whatnot. (Again, my dad treats everybody in the family like this, but never people in publice.)\n\nAnd when we got to the last machine, they had had enough.\n\n\"YOU. Sir, are and ASSHOLE!\" They shouted, pointing fingers at him. \"No.\" said my dad, flipping through his clipboard nonchalantly. \"You overloaded the moving van and paid us $300 for about $400 dollars of work.\" My dad stood there and didn't even acknowledge them. \"Move this over her-\" They cut him off. \"No. I am not moving any more SHIT until you increase our pay. Our truck got a flat and a damaged axle because of all of the shit that you loaded onto it, you didn't help us and you're treating us like children.\"\n\n\"No.\" \n\nreplied my dad. \n\n\"That's it. Fuck this.\" said the lead worker. He unloaded the last machine and said. We're not moving this for you unless you pay us.\" \n\n\"NO!\" replied my dad. he then screamed at the workers. \"LISTEN TO ME.\" slamming his fist down.\n\n\"NO, SIR, YOU LISTEN TO ME!\" The lead worker replied.\n\nAt this point I left the room to go hide in the bathroom because all they did was scream profanities.\n\nMy dad can be a jerk, we love him, and he doesn't trust anybody. I can see that in myself, after I saw how he treated those workers, and honestly, I feel really bad for the way those guys were treated. \n\nSo if any workers are reading this sub, I apologize for the way that customers can treat you. \n\nEDIT: Formatting",

        "text": " I had a 21 hour layover in Paris on the way home after a holiday abroad. I thought it was silly to spend all of it in the airport but didn't want to risk getting lost in Paris so I just took a short shuttle-bus journey to Aeroville, a glitzy shopping centre built near the airport, presumably with foreign travelers in mind as a bit of a captive audience. There was a supermarket in there, the same chain as the  supermarket I use at home, so I thought I'd hit that for a load of vaguely appropriate, affordable snacks rather than spend too much at the food hall. I gathered up around 5 euros worth of goodies, including cheeses, cherries, some sliced cooked meat, a bag of salad greens, a drink and some yogurt, then went to pay. I put some of the items on the conveyer belt thingie at the till, and, as it was a bit small, heaped the rest on the non-moving end.\n\nThe belt didn't seem to be set to stop like they usually are - it just carried on going. So the cashier started screeching at me in French. It was quite interesting to note that every single word I ever knew in French now seemed to have been replaced by a Portuguese one, and I had absolutely no clue what she was saying. I was so fascinated by this that I stood there and watched her ranting until she burned herself out, which took several minutes. When she'd sat down again and put those items through, she noticed that there were still some other items that I hadn't put on the belt, and as she'd spent so long screeching at me for putting the others there and I'd backed off a little by then, I didn't offer to move the others. So she leaped up and, off in full rant mode again, she stormed round and put the rest on the precious conveyer belt.\n\nThen the cherries hadn't been weighed and priced. Some supermarkets make you do it yourself, some do it at the till. I'd got it wrong. So she started rant number three. By this time I was finding her rather amusing and let her rant herself out, eventually waving my hand dismissively at the cherries in an attempt to communicate that she could keep the effing things if that's how she felt. \n\nShe put them down, then looked at me and and said something that sounded like it might have translated to 'Do you speak French?' So I shook my head distastefully at her. Not that I have anything against speaking French, but she had ben wielding it at me in a rather unpleasant manner for far too long now. \n\nIt was time to pay, so I opened up my purse and went to take out some money. 'No money. Credit card.' She's joking isn't she? What the fuck kind of supermarket doesn't take cash? And the fee for a foreign credit card transaction is probably more than the cost of the stuff I was buying. \n\nI should have walked out at this point, but I really needed that food as my sugars were starting to go wonky. So I put the card in the machine, put my numbers in, and failed to make the rest of the transaction work. She glowered at me. So I tried again, put the numbers in again, then wondered which button I was supposed to hit next. She lost it. She stormed around and screeched at me 'Numbers. Here.' So I put them in again. There were now eight little number on the screen, which she realised as she hit the correct button, only to be told that there was an error. She knew it was her fault this time, so I glowered at her and gestured for her to sort it out. I thought she was going to have apoplexy, but she did finally sort it. And I finally got to have some lunch. But I'm never, ever going into a French supermarket again as long as I live.",

The kid is, I'm trying to be as politically correct as well, not mentally well. \n\nThe waitresses are taking them to a back room, the mom is talking to the waitresses and they're laughing.

The kid tries to climb up to where I'm sitting. I just didn't move my arm, which was resting on the table so he couldn't pass.\n\nMy mom had some pancakes with whipped cream on them. The kid full on hammer fists the pancake. Whipped cream went fucking everywhere. We're in disbelief. \n\nThe mother comes out to get the kid.

The kid climbs into the booth and starts climbing on his wife. This time the mother is out almost immediately, and apologizes. Bald man flips the fuck out.

I pointed at her but before I said anything I noticed a table in between us with people. All of them had a DIS GUN BE GUD look on their faces. I shrugged and said \"you know what, you're not worth it\" and sat down and finished my Belgian waffle.\n\nThe waitresses told us they were regulars and normally it's not like this and blah blah. Whatever. It's over, nothing we can do about it now.\n\nThey only gave us 50% off of what my mom ordered, which was pretty bullshit but hey, we got to watch a kid punch a pancake so I can't complain too much.

        "text": "Hey all first time poster. Warning, this is kinda long.\n\nSo I ordered several criterion blu Rays from a national book selling chain that has a crazy 50% off sale through July on criterions. Shipping was through a certain parcel service that shall remain nameless.\n\nSo I was on vacation and knew I might miss the first attempt but figured I could walk to post office or wait for second. Sure enough I missed first attempt (although looking at the date and time stamp on the slip it's likely the driver didn't even try to ring my bell), but the slip said my stuff was left at an \"access point\" and gave an address a few blocks away.\n\nSweet, this will be a breeze, right? I walk over to the address which turns out to be a bodega, which I wasn't expecting. I tell the guy behind the counter I'm picking up a package and give him my name, address, and ID.\n\nI can see from where I'm standing that the area behind the counter is just boxes piled stop boxes with no apparent rhyme or reason. The clerk kind of pokes around for a bit, maybe 5-10 minutes. I'm a little annoyed but what can you do?\n\nThen another guy comes in and first guy says something to him in their language. Second guy again asks for my info and starts looking himself, seeming super annoyed. After 3 mins or so he just sort of throws his hands up and goes back to helping other people.\n\nI tell him they have my package and he needs to find it. He more or less tells me to pound sand, so I leave and call Parcel Service help.\n\nHere's where it gets real fun. The rep, clearly outsourced, follows script and tells me local facility should be calling me back in an hour. Nobody ever does. I repeat this process about 5 times, and never get a single callback. On the last try I lose my temper and demand to speak to a supervisor. The rep puts me on forever hold for 30 mins. I hang up.\n\nA while later a supervisor actually calls me back, apologizes for everything, and says she's calling the local facility directly and will be back with me in 5 mins. When she gets back says they aren't picking up phone. Promises to follow up tomorrow.\n\nSometime in the middle of the night I get a voicemail  from somebody from local facility giving a callback # that rings forever and is never picked up.\n\nWhile waiting for supervisor to follow up I call the bookseller and explain what happened, since at this point I'm skeptical I will ever find my package. Rep gets order # and immediately sends me new duplicate order (going through same carrier though...sigh.)\n\nEventually the supervisor calls me back. Bless her, apparently she just spammed the bodega's phone until they finally picked up (they were ducking calls too), then refused to get off phone until they found package. She even offered to stay on phone with me while I walked there to make sure I received it with no problems.\n\nGet there and package is torn open and looks like shit Suspect somebody snuck a peek and \"lost\" it.\n\nNever once spoke to anybody here in nyc about why the bodega wasn't being made to surrender my package they stole. The supervisor was working out of a call center in Georgia.\n\nAll's well that ends well though, the duplicate order came through so now I have some gifts for people or can sell them!",

        "text": "\nOkay, so I'm now to reddit and don't know how to format plus I'm on mobile so bear with me.\nThis just happened to me a few hours ago.\nI was on my way to work (a popular fast food chain the the US) when I decided to stop at another popular fast food place right next to mine for some coffee and nuggets. I ordered my food in the drive thru (after waiting for about 9 minutes, seriously) I was second in line to the window where you receive your food.\nThe car in front of me was handed a coffee and the workers attempted to hand her more drinks but she ignored them and started drinking her coffee instead.\nI could see from my car her face in her right mirror and she got PO'd for some reason. She started yelling at the worker in the window and practically threw her coffee at the worker. Of course they took it back to make a new one and handed her another one a few minutes later and she drove away.\nOkay, so since I work in fast food also I know that this happens a lot BUT the reason I'm posting this story in the first place is because of what happened after she drove away.\nNot even 5 feet from after she pulled out of the window she threw her coffee out of the car into the parking lot of the restaurant. Like seriously??? They fixed your coffee after yelling at them and you litter your new coffee in their parking lot.\nAfter 2 years of working at retail, people still come up with new ways to be an asshole. It amazes me.\nP.S I made sure to be extra nice to the lady working the window.\nTL;DR people are dicks.\ncommenteditsharesavehidedeletensfw",

        "text": "Hello, hello, long time lurker, first time poster, yadda yadda.\n\nToday I went down to the general pharmacy in my general European country. I am an expat in this country and speak very minimal and very broken local language, if at all - it is very different from my native language and has a lot of letters that I find nearly impossible to pronounce. Thus, I usually do all of my shopping and asking either in Russian or English. Also, the place where I work has a sort of a small mall near it where the employees usually go for lunch - this is what I did today with my colleague.\n\n\nSo we went down to the store, picked up some lunch and I mentioned that I need to visit the pharmacy as well. Since it is an intimate issue I am dealing with, I did not mention what it was to my colleague, instead I went straight to the sales person and asked for that specific product by its name, as discreetly as possible. Now, it is important to know that this product comes in two forms - an oil and a gel. I needed the gel, so I asked for it as that. Here's how the conversation went, approximately, I will be Me and the Caps Lock Lady will be CLL:\n\n\nMe: Hi, could I please have one Ointment Gel?\n\nCLL: (stares at me for a moment) VAGINA?!\n\n\nI had to take a step back, probably turned beet red and hoped the earth would open and swallow me whole. My colleague has heard this as well and is now staring at the pharmacist.\n\n\nMe: Um, yes, please, the gel one.\n\nCLL while walking to the shelf to get it for me: YOU KNOW IS FOR VAGINA? YOU NEED FOR VAGINA???\n\nMe:....yes, I know, that is what I need, thanks...\n\nCLL: BUT YOU KNOW IS FOR VAGINA YES. ANYTHING ELSE?\n\nMe: Nothankyougoodbye\n\n\nI paid and basically flew out the door, still matching the color of the very red walls of the mall. I mean, it's great to precise what the customer wants, but I certainly could have avoided the public announcement that my vagina need that particular product or any product at all. My colleague was doubling over with laughter, so I guess it was at least fun for someone.",

        "text": "I am not sure where to post this story, but this seems like an appropriate sub.\n\nA little backstory:  I have a 6 year old daughter and 3yo son.  Last year their mother and I divorced and she moved out of state for work.  Over the course of the first 6 months my kids started acting out, especially my daughter.  She was the sweetest kid in the world, always did the right thing and was really polite.  .  She started stealing all the time.  From school, from friends houses, from stores, etc and then lying about it.  Coming from a divorced family, I know how hard it can be.  I decided that I cannot be long-distance father and that my kids needed me, as much as I needed them, so I found a job and moved out there asap.  \n\nI now have my kids for the summer and it has been amazing.  The first week I had them, my daughter had stolen again from \"the bullseye store\" as they call it , but I caught her in the act.  I have tried telling her the consequences to stealing, etc but nothing would sink in.  \n\nA week later, we were heading back in to the bullseye store.  My kids ran ahead of me to the cart area and I was still walking through the front doors.  As I am walking in I hear a man yelling \"STOP!!!\"  and see another man sprinting straight towards me with his arms full of merchandise.  Now, I am a good sized man (6'5\", 215lbs) and I was in the military and played sports, yada yada.... but I don't know why I did this, I guess instinct just kind of took over.  The man ran straight towards me and was going to try to squeeze past me, but I grabbed the dude and used his momentum to body slam him.  All of his merchandise flew outside, his cell phone slid onto the side walk. it was a healthy hit.  The man regained him composure, grabbed everything he could, and continued running.  I figured the security guard would come over and grab him while he was down, but he just walked over to me to see if I was ok, and yelled out \"I better not see you here again!\" to the man running through the parking lot. Their policy is that once he hit the door they couldn't stop him.  \n\nMy kids ran over to me who had watched the whole thing from the cart area.  The security guard told me I should have let him go since my kids were there and I could have gotten hurt. My daughter asked what happened, and the security guard explained to her that the man was stealing, and how bad that is, and that he was trying to catch him.\n\n People came up to me and commented on what happened, etc.  We finally got the cart and started walking through the store.  I could tell the wheels inside my daughters head were moving, fast.\n\nAbout a minute later, she says:\n\nHer: \"Daddy, that man was stealing from the store?\"\n\nMe: \"Yup.\"\n\nHer: \"And that is why you tackled him and the security guard was trying to catch him?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, sweetheart.\"\n\nHer: \"Would he have gone to jail?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, the cops would have came and taken him to jail\"\n\nHer:\"Oh.  Well, I am NEVER stealing anything, EVER again...\"\n\nShe has not even thought about stealing again.  If anything, she will ask me how much something is, if she can buy it, and then puts it back if I say no or if she doesn't have enough money in her little wallet.  I still keep my eye on her, cause she is 6, but she has done a complete 180 from the beginning of the summer.\n\nI know it's not a typical retail customer story, but that whole event paired with the explanation from the security guy, helped me so much with her behavior.  The summer has come and gone since that day, and my daughter and son are back to their normal sweet selves.  And I accomplished something their mom couldn't, so being able to casually rub that in her face is fun too.  (I'm kidding, I try to be as nice as I can to her for the kids.)\n\nTL:DR  Security guard helped me parent.  After I body slammed a thief. ",

        "text": "I live in South Florida, and me and my boyfriend both work in the service industry. We are college students who also work full time an its hard for us to have a nice night out, so when we do we try to make it special. For our date night we had made reservations at a upscale italian restaurant. I'm 23 and my BF is 24, so we are fairly young but we we're both dressed up, me in a nice dress with heels, hair and makeup done, and my bf in a sport coat and button up. \nWe we're greeted by the hostess and sat at our table where she handed us menus. She then paused and glared at us in a condescending tone \"I'm not going to put a drink menu down because you guys don't look old enough to drink.\"\nFirst of all, the hostess looked to be younger than us, probably a teenager, but of course I don't want to assume. Being in our early 20's we thoroughly expect to get ID-ed whenever we go out, and we don't get offended by it. I wouldn't even have cared if she just asked if we would like to see a drink menu before placing it down, or even not put it down in the first place but not commented on it. But I so offended to be talked down to by someone like that.\nI replied by telling her, \"Just do your job and put the menu down.\" I wasn't rude with my tone but I was short and clearly not amused. She looked at me, rolled her eyes and turned around and walked away.\nThe server came over and was excellent and by the end of the dinner I didn't really care any more as our food and the rest of the night was great. Between the food, drinks, apps and dessert our bill was around $150 for the two of us. \nAt the end of the night I complimented the manager on the service but told him about my experience with the rude hostess, and suggested that he not employ bratty teenagers on a power trip if he wants to uphold the standards of fine dining.",

I say, \"Isn't that unsafe?\" and she tells me I can go to the dealer and get a free rental car until the part comes in. The next day I go to the [car company] dealership, and the guy at the desk does the same thing and orders the part for me again because apparently the other one didn't go through and he couldn't find me in the system.

How is this different than before though?\" He tries explaining how parts need to be ordered anyway and offers a long convoluted explanation. Obviously he just thought it was cheaper to use a spare part for me than pay for a rental car. The funny, horrible part is that the spare part existed the whole time, but they would never have given it to me up front unless there was a clear reason it would save them money. The whole thing is kind of horrible, funny and sad at the same time and shows the calculated side of companies, people &amp; money.",

        "text": "Two weeks ago, I went to a diner to have myself a large lunch. I came in after I finished work, so I was wearing my standard work clothes(white-button shirt and long khakis).\n\nThe waitress was very enthusiastic, took my drink order. I was looking at the menu when she arrived with my drink(fruit punch). \n\nThen I heard gasp and felt very cold. She spilled the drink all over me.\n\nThinking fast, I shouted some curse words and told the waitress that I'll be right back. I went to my car to change into my gym clothes, and ran to the dry cleaners nearby to salvage my work clothes.\n\nI come back fifteen minutes later, and I'm greeted by the manager who saw the small fiasco. He apologized for the inconvience and offered to comp me my meal, and pay for my dry cleaning. I was thinking \"Fucking great customer service\", but when I returned to my same table the waitress was replaced by the manager.\n\nI eventually saw the waitress near the bathrooms crying, with the manager yelling at her. I ordered my food to-go as I was uncomfortable staying there for any longer. 15 minutes later, I get my food for free, and I find the waitress in the parking lot smoking a cig to calm down and hold back tears. \n\nI spoke to her, told her it was all an accident, and to not let the manager's yelling get to her. She cheered up afterwards, and I told me that she promises to give me the perfect waitress service the next time I come back. \n\nI'm going to the diner again today at around the same time. Will update after lunch.\n\n\nUPDATE: So I got off work while getting some praise from my manager on making a big sale for my store(college bookstore - I sold a laptop). I went to the diner to have lunch and I was seated in the same section as before. I got the same waitress as before, and we had a small conversation throughout my lunch. \n\nShe was on point with everything; When she returned with my drink order, she placed my drink on the opposite end of the table and we shared a laugh about it. She apparently didn't get any monetary penalty from earlier, so that had me relieved. I tipped her $10 on a $30 bill, and I also went to the owner of the diner(he acting manager) to praise the waitress.\n\nBig shout-out to the elderly Korean couple who saved my work clothes. ",

We didn't find any till I went home and looked at my \"U\" switch is using the wrong letter keycap, instead it was using \"I\". I go get a refund then come back a day later, again I buy it and open it, I noticed it was using the same box. double taped and the same scratch marks from yesterday. I let it go. I check at home and find my rubber feet for the armrest are missing, Im like its ok I can live without them. 2 days later I find out that this time I have my numpad \"Enter\" keycap is another \"plus\" keycap. At this point I contact azio. as they replied to me I go exchange yet for another third tampered keyboard by NCIX, this time the guy talks about how they dont tamper with their products, its bullshit, he opens the box and the keyboard cardboard box is ripped already in front of the my friend the guy and me, and talks abut how it could be the customs. Its bullshit because everytime I go there they have a unit that is already opened a day later they tamper and resell, claim its new. So I tell azio i got 3 messed up keyboard even though I believe It is NCIX's fault for having crappy workers.\n\nAnyways good guy Azio sends me my missing F7 Keycap for the third keyboard and a \"Gift\".\n\na week later today I get a nice big FedEx box with my keycap and an Exo-1 Gaming Azio mouse which is pretty awesome.\n\nThe reason I wanted this keyboard so bad is not because it is cheap but because it pleases me.\nI know you may think Im snobby about little keycap problem. I'm not, but when you go and replace a keyboard 3 times, and you don't get the full package its not fair.\n\nSo I would like to thank Azio for helping me out, and for this awesome gift. and would totally recommend Azio's products. to anyone special the MGK-1\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9PqaRqq.jpg\n\nAgain Thank You Azio",

        "text": "So long story short, I called in to downgrade my internet speed from 50 Mbps to 15 Mbps and was told there was a $15 service fee to downgrade. So I was thinking to myself, \"This must take some time/work for them to downgrade my internet\". So I reluctantly told the agent that I was fine with the fee. She promptly responded that \"This change will take effect within 2 minutes\".\n\nSo I paid $15 for 2 minutes worth of work! I then decided to voice my opinion to their customer service department, here is the email chain:\n\nFirst email I sent\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;I am a current internet customer, using your service for quite sometime, at the 50 Mbps connection speed. I am quite happy with your service and do appreciate your business services.\n\n&gt;I had to call in and downgrade my internet to 15 Mbps, just because I do not require the higher speeds any longer. I was told there was a $15 fee to downgrade, the technician told me that this would take effect within 2 minutes. I have a hard time believing that this $15 fee is due to the extra work that goes into this process.\n\n&gt;I kindly request that you waive this fee for me and suggest that you remove this \"downgrade fee\" for other customers as well.\n\n&gt;My service address is:\n&gt;[Redacted]\n&gt;Thank you for your time.\n\nResponse from agent:\n&gt;Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience, but we this is a service fee that we charge for downgrading of services.  Unfortunately we cannot waive this as the system picks this up showing that we are having to downgrade they system and automatically charges the fee.  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to call our customer service line at XXX-XXX-XXXX.  Thank you and have a great day\n\nResponse from me\n&gt;Thanks for the response, it makes me sad that the \"system\" can do things, but the people that run the system are unable to workaround it. Maybe giving a credit to my bill would be another option?\n\n&gt;This response is a poor example of customer service and I ask that you escalate my ticket. If you think about it, losing a customer over a $15 fee is not very logical. If you were to waive the fee and keep me as a customer, my small payment of $50 a month adds up to $600 a year or $3000 for three years.\n\n&gt;This means that your company would choose to save $15 now, rather than make $3000 in a few years. If every customer were to complain, I am sure this business model would not last very long.\n\n&gt;Again, I do appreciate your business products as they are quite good, so I kindly ask again to waive this fee (find a work around) or I will be forced to find another provider.\n\n&gt;If you would like to discuss this please call or email me.\n\n&gt;Sent from my iPhone\n&gt;[redacted]\n\nFinal response from agent\n&gt;Hello, I understand the frustration of it all.  I can waive the fee this one time but it will not be waived again in the future.  I have removed that from your account.  I thank you for your response and hope you have a great day.  Thank you for your time.\n\nEDIT: $1800 for three years.\n",

As a cashier, I know what it's like when there's a vast, waste land of nothingness and then all of a sudden it's like every customer in the store comes up. This was one of those times, I was in the middle of this line that was about 9 people long, just in the right position to watch this happen. \n\nAs a note, the cashier just did a double-page for her co-worker to open, it was understandable but not very loud, so she paged again. An older woman parks her cart in the opening for the cashiers to enter behind their cash, staring at the current lone cashier. For a visual, her cart is so full she's holding a pile at the top of it so things don't fall out. \n\n&gt;Lady: Are you going to get someone to open?!\n\n&gt;Cashier: (stunned by this random person nearly behind her) I just paged for a cashier, they'll be up soon. \n\nThe lady then looks around and spots a guy in a green smock approaching the front, she takes her cart and follows him. \n\n&gt;Lady: Where are you opening?\n\n&gt;Cashier 2: Uh, I'm opening beside this cash but it'll be the next person in line. *points to the large line of people*\n\n&gt;Lady: Oh, I have to wait in line? But I'm ready now?\n\n&gt;Cashier 2: Sorry, the back of the line is behind that guy in the brown shirt over there. \n\nShe then tries to slide her cart in front of a young couple, who let her know they're in line, then she does it to the person in front of me, no, they're in line too. I step ahead so she can't butt in. She asks the people behind me if they're waiting? Surprise, yes they are. And finally she makes it to the back of the line. \n\nNext time lady, I suggest the subtle \"I'm old and small and don't realize there's a line let me park my cart right in front of you all, you can't get mad at me I'm cute and don't realize what I'm doing,\" route. Not point yourself out as the lady who thinks she's the most important person in the store. ",

        "text": "Today I broke down and went to the local big corporate cell phone store to pick up a new phone. My old iPhone was on its last leg and in dire need of replacing. I went during my lunch break, spoke to the sales rep and explained what I needed. I told him I wanted to sign a new 2 year commitment and I wanted the new Galaxy S6 Active. He quickly pulled up my info and said no problem. Very helpful and courteous. Before I could ask him how long it would take to get everything finalized and get me out the door, he went to the stock room and pulled out the phone. It was then I asked how long it would take to get me out of the door and said it would take approximately an hour. I told him I didn't want to push my luck getting back to work on time and that I'd come back after work. He walked me out, opened the door and said see you later, O85OGEEK. OK!\n\nI come back after work and am greeted by another sales rep. I didn't see the first rep around so I figured he was on lunch or had gone home. I explained to this new rep what I wanted and he asked me to take a seat while he pulled up my information. Here is where the fun starts. \n\n\nRep: Which phone do you want?  \nMe: Galaxy s6 Active.  \n\nRep asks for my ID to access my account. Meanwhile, some of the other reps across the store are laughing loudly about something. The guy who is helping me starts paying attention to them and starts laughing with them on and off for a minute or so.\n\nRep:(After looking through my info for a few minutes)Wow, you're on a very old plan. (I've been a customer for 5 years and I'm grandfathered in to an unlimited data plan and I'm getting a 15% discount though my employer)  \nMe: Yes I am and I'd like to keep it. :)  \nRep: Which phone did you want? (second time he asks)  \nMe: Galaxy s6 Active.  \n\nRep then starts telling me about the NEXT plan which I have already gone over the details of at home and am not interested in.  \n\nRep: I can get you a 3GB plan with NEXT for $55 plus tax. You'd be saving vs your $88 plan.  \nMe: I'd rather pay more and keep my unlimited data. You never know when you'll need it.  \nRep: I didn't realize you had unlimited data (yeah, right. You already admitted to knowing my plan details) Well according to your recent data usage you aren't using more than 3gb/mo.  \nMe: I am aware but I like the idea of having extra data just in case. I want to stay on my current plan. I may change jobs soon and I might need to use more data then.  \nRep: Well in that case, your new employer will pay for your phone bill.  \nMe: Not necessarily. It depends on the employer.   \nRep: Well the reason why I say that is because I know employers will pay for that.  \nMe: Again, it depends on the employer. Sometimes they do, sometimes they pay for some of the phone bill and sometime they don't. (I cant believe I'm having this conversation)  \nRep: Well the phone you want is only available with NEXT. (this is a blatant lie)  \nMe: That's not true, I've already looked up the info at home and I've already talked to Employee A earlier today and he said it wouldn't be an issue.  \n\nRep then gets up and says he's going to ask Employee A about it. He walks off to the back room. A few minutes later the guy that was helping me during lunch break comes out, visibly busy and says he cant help me at the moment because he's working with another customer. I tell him that I didn't ask that he help me I just want to get my new 2 year agreement with X phone and the other guy says it has to be with the NEXT plan. He says he'll talk to the other guy and have him take care of it. OK! Employee B comes out:\n\nRep: So what phone did you want? (3rd time he asks)  \nMe: Galaxy S6 Active.  \nRep: Do you want to wait for Employee A to finish up so he can help you? (are you serious??)  \nMe: (looking and sounding pissy) No I'd rather you help me so I can go about my day.  \nRep: Okay. I'm just trying to help you get the best deal.  \nMe: I understand but you are not listening to what I want. I've asked for a new 2 year agreement with the same unlimited data plan and you're telling me I cant get it on the phone I want.  \nRep: (looking like he wants to punch me in the face) So do you want me to help you?  \nMe: .....YES.  \nRep goes to the back to pull out the phone. After about 5 minutes he comes out. Sets up the new phone sim card and finishes up the process on his iPad/tablet.  \n\nRep: Okay, you're all set, just sign here.  \nHe hands me the tablet and all I see is the legal disclaimer and a place for a signature.  \n\nMe: I don't see any information as to what plan I'm agreeing to... I'm keeping the same plan as before, right?  \nRep: You're not agreeing to anything to didn't ask for :)  \nMe: Okay :)  \n\nI sign the agreement. I'm still thinking this guy is trying to screw me but I'm thinking to myself there's no way this guy is lying to me again. Either way I'm not leaving the store until I see my data plan on my account. I pay for the phone and he hands me the receipt and tries to finish up quickly with me. I study the receipt and notice it says on one line, ADD: DATAPRO PLAN 3GB.  \n\nMe: Why does it says I added a 3GB data plan?  \nRep: Oh it just says that but you are actually keeping the same unlimited data plan as before. (Something about the system not recognizing old plans. He pulls up closer to me and shows me the tablet, points only to the voice portion of my plan.  \n\nRep: See, same plan as before.  \nMe: But that doesn't tell me anything about my data. Can you pull up my data plan details?  \nRep: No it doesn't show it on here.  \n\nThe tablet is within reach so I start scrolling down to see if I can see anything about my data.  \n\nMe: May I see the tablet so I can check?  \nRep: (In a very rude tone) No, actually, you cant. Its mine.  \nMe: But its my information... I should be able to see it. I'm not going to walk out with your tablet and I don't want to see anything else besides my account...  \nRep: You can pull it up on your phone on our website.  \nMe: My old phone no longer has data and you have my new phone.  \nRep: Oh. (fiddles with my new phone before handing it to me) Here!   \n\nI pull up the website and log in. Sure enough, I have a new data plan with a 3GB limit!!!!\nAt this point I'm steaming. I'm thinking I've had this plan for ages and did NOT want to get rid of it. Why would this guy think he can get away with this?? He should've been able to tell by now that Ive done my homework, I know what I want and I mean business.   \n\nMe: My plan has been switched. Why did you switch my data plan after I specified what I wanted?  \nRep: Hmmm. It shouldn't have done that. If the system changed it, there's not much I can do about it. (goes back to fiddle with his tablet for a minute or two)  \nMe: I dont understand. Your system can handle old plans. This isn't the first time I've upgraded to a new phone on the same plan.  \nRep: Let me go talk to my manager and see what we can do.  \n\nHe goes to the back room again. Meanwhile all I can think of is all the crap I'm going to have to go through to get my old data plan back, if its even possible. My hands are shaking at this point, I'm so mad. Rep comes out after 15 minutes and without saying anything, sits down and starts fiddling with his tablet again.  \n\nMe: So what is going on?  \nRep: I'm trying to get your old data plan back.  \n\nAt this point he spends another eternity chatting with their support on his tablet before telling me they'll be able to switch it back after all.  \n\nRep: Good news, your plan has been changed back.  \n\nAt this point, he shows me the same exact page he did before on his tablet and now, miraculously, it shows me my data plan details! No way!?  \n\nRep: You're all set to go.  \n\nI verify my data says unlimited on my new phone and walk out of that store SO.DAMN.FAST.  \n\n\nI haven't really wanted to explore my new phone yet. The whole experience was so downright dirty, I almost want to return it, pay the restocking fee and sign up with someone else. I wonder how many other people they've done this to. I think of people like my parents who barely speak the language and aren't so knowledgeable about stuff like this and it really pisses me off to think that someone would take advantage of them. Nobody is in the business of customer service anymore. We're just another buck for the greedy corporations unfortunately.  \n\nIf you've read this far down, thanks.\n",

Entering the establishment, I was met with an air-conditioned building, a friendly staff that gave me absolutely no problems, and a more than adequate meal.\n\nBut, it was not without its problems. Shortly after placing my order, I met with my first foe: the ice machine. When I used it, I only got two cubes before the machine clogged up. I stared at it awkwardly, since I had no clue what to do. I settled for taking a straw and trying to knock it loose. I succeeded in getting half the ice into my cup, and the other half into the grate.\n\nTrying the machine again, I met with the same results. Rather than repeat my experiment, I notified staff, who handled it well. I neglected to get a lid for my cup, which brings me to my second foe: the chair. \n\nTurning away from the machine, my elbow established contact with the back of a chair, projecting the contents of my cup all over an uninhabited table. Rather than bother staff again, I resolved to clean it up myself. Finishing that, I picked up a lid quickly, so I could go sit down and hide my shame. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized that the lid was a size too small. ",

For these checkouts they have 2 baggers. \n  Almost everytime I go I end up bagging my own groceries, not that I mind since I can organize my food in each bag but it interesting. I'm a regular and have been for as long as I can think so most of the checkers know my name and we'll talk while checking out. \n  So I ended up applying to the store since all the checkers thought that I was pretty good at bagging and figured I could use the extra money so I did. I ended up having an interview with one of the newer managers. We go through the process and I let them know that I would be a summer worker because I leave for school. They then tell me that they aren't looking for people like me and that are overstaffed for baggers. \n  The last time I went to get my groceries (maybe 2 weeks after the interview) I end up getting one of the checkers who knows me pretty well and knew that I had an interview and asks me how it went. I tell her that I was told they were overstocked on baggers and she just laughs. She's been there forever and is shocked since they never hve enough baggers. So we're talking and I'm bagging and while this is all happening the manager who interviewed me walks by while I'm bagging, looks at me and walks off. The checker laughed and at the end of the transaction she lets me know that shes giving me a discount since bag my food 8/10 times. It was only like $5 off but it was nice. I pay, say thanks, say my goodbye, and leave. \n  I just think that it was funny since they have a \"full roster\" of baggers yet I have been bagging my food almost everytime I go there.",

I have this flashback about dining out in a chain restaurant several years ago, and maybe it fits here. \n\nThis is a well known chain restaurant in my place that time, frequented by mostly college students and young workers. It's quite casual. My ex bf and I liked the food there, so one night, we went there to have dinner.\n\nI mistakenly ordered a huge meal while being half full. The meal consisted of rice beef bowl, with dumplings on separate dish. So, being the broke college student I was, I summoned the waiter to please bring me a takeaway box to take the dumplings home. It's definitely an ordinary request (at least in my country - I'm not from Western country). The waiter had trainee badge on his uniform. \n\n\nHe seemed to be shocked by my request, with fearful expression, asking me \"are you sure?\". However, after talking for a while, he brought me box and bag from the bag. I said thanks, and proceeded to put the dumplings in the box. \n\nAfter that, I continued to eat my rice beef bowl. I was about to finish it when another staff (I presumed head waiter or manager of some sort, since he wore fancier uniform) came to our table. He striked a conversation with me.\n\n\nManager: \"I noticed you asked for takeaway box before. Did you get it?\"\n\nOP: \"Yes I did. Thank you very much!\"\n\nManager: \"Do you want to takeout the rest of the meal too? You know, to save money.\"\n\n\nI was perplexed by this remark. I didn't understand what he was trying to say. I mean...what? Did he try to insult me for being cheap, just because I ask to pack food I couldn't finish that night home? What did I do wrong? My ex was as surprised as I was. We're normal customers. We're not obnoxious, we pay in cash, we're polite to the staffs... In fact, we're pretty timid people who just wanted to be left alone while eating. Please enlighten me, reddit! I'm still baffled when I randomly remember this occurrence. I never received that kind of treatment anywhere else while eating out. \n\nI just said no, hurriedly finished the meal, and paid. I never returned there to eat again.",

        "text": "So my boyfriend's birthday was 7/10. I wanted to get him a TV stand and a gaming chair because his gaming situation was uncomfortable. More often than not, he'd end up standing at his TV which was up on top of his dresser. So I found a TV stand pretty easily at the Swedish furniture store, then drove around unsuccessfully for 3 hours trying to find a chair.\n\nAll of the stores that I went to said that they only got them in around the holidays. Which meant I was gonna have to order it online. BallShart.com had one for way cheaper than anywhere else, so I ordered from there. So I placed the order on 7/4, fully prepared to pay extra for faster shipping if I needed to. But wait! They have free site to Store shipping that will be at the store for me to pick up on 7/9! Sweet!\n\nI should note that the shipping timetable did not say it would arrive around 7/9, or between 7/9 and another date, But definitively ON 7/9. I was assured of this multiple times throughout the process. I received my order confirmation within the hour. \n\nI checked my BallShart.com account several times over the next few days for some sort of status update, but it didn't change. After having a hellishly busy week, I finally got a chance to call the store it was meant to be shipped to the afternoon before it was supposed to arrive. However, the associate at the store had no record of an order for me. After trying multiple times to find some info, he told me that there wasn't anything he could do at the store, so I should call the number for the site.\n\nHold times were insane (like over an hour) so I wasn't able to call until the next morning  (7/9). After being on hold for half an hour, I finally got through to a representative who told me that my order had just shipped the night before and wouldn't arrive until 7/20. I expressed my displeasure at this and she offered a solution: she could place a second order to be overnighted to my home and waive the shipping costs. When the other chair arrived at the store, I could just call back for a refund.\n\nI agreed and thanked her, as she had been very kind and helpful. I got the order conformation in less than 20 minutes, then the shipping confirmation later that day. The next day (7/10, the birthday), I checked the tracking info on the carrier's site to try to time when it would arrive so I could plan around my other errands and preparations. The package was in my state's next door neighbor. But the information didn't change all morning or afternoon.\n\nI called the carrier who told me that, although I had gotten the shipping update from BallShart, it wasn't shipped because they never actually handed off the package to the carrier. \n\nSo I call AGAIN and wait on hold for 30 minutes to talk to someone who disconnects me, then call back 3 times only to be disconnected by the automated system each time, before finally getting to speak to another rep. He's very nice and helpful and apologetic and tells me that the order has just shipped out literally while I was on the phone with him at 4something in the afternoon and won't arrive until Monday, 7/13. At this point, there's nothing I can do because Carrier doesn't deliver on Saturdays. \n\nThanks BallShart.com. Your customer service reps are actually not bad but your shipping department sucks dirty porcupine balls.\n\nEDIT: I ordered a chair not a shirt...",

After visiting the website, i can confirm that i was rather impressed and planned to visit the aforementioned store after work.\n\nUpon on arriving there was about 3 other customers in there (more people were in there, but were friends/family who weren't purchasing anything) and most of your Sales Advisors seemed rather busy dealing with them. I don't mind that, as i once worked in retail myself and know how stressful things can get on the shop floor. So i carried on looking at various suits, actually circling the whole store two or three times looking at the different designer brands, etc. \n\nEven those with an untrained eye could see that i wasn't entirely sure, as i'm fairly new to Suit shopping and weren't entirely convinced of my measurements. Nevertheless, i finally found a suit and went to try it on, it all fitted very nicely apart from the jacket, which felt one size too big. Not wanting to get unchanged to then go out, find a new jacket, go back in and get changed back into it all again, i stuck my head out of the curtains and looked to my left to see a young woman with a tape measure around her neck, our eyes clearly locked and i made a gesture to see if she could assist me, her eyes went immediately back to the rack she was working on and carried on pushing the suits round.\n\nUndeterred by this, i looked to my right where the tills were, and again, another staff member clearly saw me, but then immediately looked down at their till. Whether they didn't take me seriously as a customer, or just didn't fancy giving me a hand, i'll never know.\n\nI ended up just putting the suit back onto the coat hangar, and promptly headed for the exit, only then, did a young lad faintly mutter an \"alright?\" to me, just as i was leaving through the front exit.\n\nI don't expect anything to be done with this information or feedback - and i have really offered feedback like this before for any store experience, but i felt this needed highlighting as a potential sale was missed, something that's probably not that big in the grand scheme of things, but it has put [GENERIC SUIT SELLING PLACE] in a bad light for me now.\n\nThank you for your patience and attention when reading this.\n\nKind Regards,",

We are dressed up for our night out and we were hot (in the good way, not all sweaty). We go in and the hostess tells us there is a 30 minute wait. OK, we get a drink and wait. After 30 minutes they tell us it will be another 20 minutes. Not OK, we are hungry.\n\nWe go to another restaurant down the road with another scenic lake view. 45 minute wait in the bar. We are finally seated and place our order, nachos app, prime rib dinners. After 20 minutes we get our app. Good nachos, but we really want meat!!! Nachos are done, the empty plate stares at us, our waitress is nowhere to be found. My friend goes to find our waitress since the empty nacho plate has been empty for 20 minutes. We ask about our order and she disappears for 15 minutes. \n\nWhen she returns it is not good. \"What did you order?\" stated with no apology and no remorse. My friend exploded!!  \n\n\"YOU LOST OUR ORDER???!! We are leaving! There will be no bill! We will NEVER \"try\" to eat here ever again!\" And she storms out of the restaurant. I tell the waitress \"So sorry, but she's right. We will not be back.\" Exit stage left.\n\nSo we head down the road to Den.... errrr Lenny's. We explain that we had started our night 3 hours ago. We explain about the 2 restaurants that failed us. We explain about the lost order for prime rib. We tell them PLEASE FEED US ASAP, and we had food on the table within 2 minutes, salad and bread and sodas and water. Salad and bread never tasted so good. I don't recall what we had for entrees, but it was food from the gods!!\n\nThank you Lenny's! You made us fans for life that night.\n\nTL:DR Lenny's saved two hot girls from starvation.

The waitress seems awesome until she says, \"Oh, and I'll be training a girl, she doesn't actually need the help so we'll just be tag-teaming you.\" But the trainee is nowhere to be found. We get our drinks and order their special for each of us (one soup/salad, one entree, one dessert), an appetizer, and new drinks (for the adults) because their happy hour was almost over. \n\n\n\n**Trainer**: Super bubbly, very nice, gave recommendations, and was the perfect example of a server.\n\n**Trainee**: A wet noodle. She barely spoke when she interacted with us, did the bare minimum, and was rude towards the end.\n\n\n\nWe finally see the *trainee* when she brings out some bread and the new drinks, and I asked her for honey butter to go with the bread, of course that isn't a problem and she will be right back. The *trainer* comes out with the appetizer and I told her to ask the *trainee* to forget the honey butter, as we have eaten all of the bread and we have the real food now, it would be a waste to bring out.\n\n\nA few minutes later we get more bread, but no honey butter. I asked the *trainee* why we got bread and she said she wanted us to try, oh wait, she forgot the honey butter. Be right back. Five minutes later (appetizer is already done and we've gotten our salads from the *trainer*) we get the butter and try small amounts of it so we don't waste it.\n\n\nWe get our food from the *trainer*. All is awesome and she even waited to make sure steaks were cooked properly, didn't need anything, etc. Mid-way through eating I ask the *trainee* for waters instead of alcohol to finish up, and she comes back with the water and the check. I asked her about the dessert. She had no idea what I was talking about and tried to hand me the dessert menu. I tried to explain that we had gotten the special but she wasn't having it. I had to open the check to show her that all of our desserts were on there and she finally understood. She pulled out her notepad and asked what we wanted. At this point I should have just said forget it, but we re-ordered the desserts and just settled down to talk while we waited. \n\n\nThe *trainer* came back with the desserts and more waters for everyone so we weren't dry and and apologized for the confusion. While we were eating the dessert we hear this from the table nearby being helped by the same team:\n&gt;Customer1: I can't figure out if I should tip extra because they are training or not.\n\n&gt;Customer2: I pulled aside the trainee and she said that the tips were split between the two of them evenly since it's a regular shift for her, so I would tip extra, maybe even double. \n\n&gt;Customer1: Makes sense, I'll tip 30%, wasn't perfect.\n\n*customers leave and the trainer/busboy are helping each other clean the table*\n\n&gt;Trainer: Wow, they tipped her 30% every table has gone above and beyond for her, maybe I should have told her we were splitting tips tonight since I was helping because she is MAKING BANK. I'm glad my own tables are tipping okay tonight.\n\n&gt;Busboy: You aren't splitting tips?\n\n&gt;Trainer: No, I wasn't even supposed to be training her tonight but she said she still needed some help so I said I would. I have my own tables and I'm just stopping by hers when I notice they need help.\n\n\nWhat?? I'm so glad I heard all of that before I did the tip. I tipped 7% (from reading talesfromyourserver I can never tell what tipout should be) and we left. I was so annoyed at the *trainee* taking advantage of the situation and then still sucking on top of that. Every annoyance we had was her fault, the *trainer* kept fixing all of the mistakes but was getting none of the money.",

I told her that I felt more in control than with alcohol and that it was also less expensive. To keep the conversation going I asked her if she had ever tried it, which was quite obvious at this point.\n\nOf course she did and she started the most unbelievable story I ever heard as a costumer. She and some friends rented a bungalow on a park and were planning to do XTC. When they settled they took a pill and some time later two of her friends decided to explore the park a little bit while she stayed at 'home'.\n\nAfter a little hour the XTC started to kick in. Her friends were still walking outside and suddenly one of them spots a walking gnome, just like from a fairytale. They are astonished and decided to bring the gnome to the bungalow and put it in the cabinet. My hairdresser was still in the bungalow and didn't realize they already came home.\n\nShe saw them acting somewhat weird, which she thought didn't come from the drugs. She asked what was up and they said that they catched a gnome. ''A gnome? Those things don't even exist in real life.'', she said. They were still very decisive and proposed her to look in the cabinet. She still didn't believe it of course, but she opened the door of the cabinet to find a real lilliputian...\n\nAfterwards, the lilliputian decided to call the police and they had to leave the park. They also had to appear in court. My hairdresser said that the judge thought it was kind of funny, although she didn't say this of course. They were eventually charged with community service.

Then while asking if there'd be anything else, the car started yelling \"that's it that's it\" whole driving away. \n\nI heard the car say that the worker should take their job seriously. \n\n\nLike. Seriously. Wtf. \n\n\nSo when I got to the speaker, I immediately apologized for the bitch in front of me, saying how she did not deserve that at all. \n\nThe worker agreed with me wholeheartedly. Then she got my order and etc. \n\n\nI pulled up. The fucktard car of course pulled up a bit too far past the window. I heard the car saying shit, but I couldn't decipher it. \n\n\nI got to the window, and said something like \"how dare you have fun and smile while working\" while smiling at the worker. \n\nThe worker told me that apparently the car told the her to not dare spit in her food, as of she would have. \n\nI then said \"so she clearly knew she was being a bitch if she was worried that you'd fuck with her food\"\n\nBlah blah, the worker comes back with my food, and excitedly hands it to me and tells me have a nice night. I immediately say thanks, then look down into the bag as I drive away. \n\n\nThere was an order of cinnamon twists thrown in. I turned back and smiled at the worker, who smiled back. I'm glad I made her feel better about that shitty experience right away, rather than her fester in that bullshit negativity. \n\n\n\nOh, and there were definitely kids under the age of 10 in that car. This happened at 1:40am. Rawr. \n",

        "text": "Now I've been around reddit a lot and this is my first Customer post. This story didn't actually happen to me, but it happened to my mother and grandmother when they where shopping on holiday. Not very exciting, just a bit of a 'grrr, we'll never know' story.\n\nNow, I understand tensions between locals and tourists exist and all that, I have nothing against the supermarket owners in that sense. But no matter where you're from or who you are, if you're an employee you treat people with respect, and the same goes for the customer to the employee. \n\nMy mother and gran had been on going on holiday to that country for years, long before I was born. We're a pretty big family so they where getting lots of essentials, which for a supermarket is good business right? Apparently not. They told me that when they where loading the stuff up onto the belt, the cashier guy kept chucking it rudley to the other end after scanning it, leaving no time for my gran (an old lady) and my mum to bag/catch it. There was no other explanation for it, the guy was just being all out rude and making it clear that he was angry that he had to check out so much stuff. \n\nNow I know it must be a pain, But even if it was annoying, he didn't have to be so rude about it. My gran and mum didn't say anything to him, didn't tell him to hurry - he snatched up products and tossed them along the belt. My mum kept saying how much he made it clear that he was annoyed with her and my gran.\n\nSo my gran tries to speak up, and my mum says 'leave it'. For a moment my gran thinks she means 'just let it go even if he's being rotten' but then she said, \"No. Leave it.\" And walked out. They both walked on right out and left all of the groceries there, tired of being treated like a nuisance.\n\nThey walked out and came to our holiday apartment, My mum fuming. My gran and her tell this story again and again whenever we go abroad, and we never had an experience like it. My gran and mum have worked in jobs where customers can be HORRIBLE. My gran's worked in customer service for years, all her life, she'd never have done/said anything to the cashier guy to make his rudeness justifiable. I always wonder what his problem was. Gran says they never found out why he was being such a jerk, but she and mum joked they wished they could cross by the supermarket just to see the face of the guy.\n \nI don't know what his problem was, never will. I feel bad for the people who had to put the stuff back, but I'm glad my gran and mum didn't just take the treatment.",

I'm a lazy hippy at heart and I hate excessively using plastic bags so I bring my own canvas ones. Also worth noting: I only buy a few things each visit because the store is next to my work so I go often and use the self-checkout.\n\nFor some really annoying reason the self-checkout person always bags my groceries while I'm paying. At first I was caught unawares, but now I make sure to put my bags at the end of the belt to signal I have them but they still will bag it in plastic.\n\nEven if I tell them I'll do it, even when I say I have my own bags, even then, they bag it in plastic. Even my gallon of milk, which has its own damn handle, gets jammed in a plastic bag.\n\nSince they keep ignoring me I've started rebagging my groceries and leaving the plastic bags behind and I get glared at all the time now, yet they still effing bag my groceries while I'm paying.\n\nI even tried going to their other location and the same thing happens. And the other day it took 5 minutes for someone to come and help me when the machine wanted verification, because I needed to remove an item, and when I looked over someone had ninja-bagged my stuff.\n\nArgh!\n\nAs a former retail drone I'm guessing it's some corporate requirement, but it's so annoying...\n",

Paid the $217-ish dollars (plus tax), bagged the 3ds, and walked out. \n\n\nThen right at that moment, I realized I had bought a black one rather than a red one that I know my son likes. I wanted to make his birthday present the best it could possibly be, so I went back into the department store and asked for an exchange. I went straight to the product return area and waited in line until the woman at the counter called me up.\n\n\n\n&gt; CS Woman: \"Did you open this box?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Nope.\"\n\nShe opens up the box, checks everything inside, then finally pulls out the 3DS. She turns it on, checking every little detail, and taps a few times on the touch screen, leaving a few fingerprint marks on the outer case and the screen. \n\n&gt; CS Woman: \"Let me talk to the supervisor.\"\n\nShe walks into this room behind the counter, looking around, seeming a bit confused, and then calls over this other woman in a red collared uniform. She walks over to the counter and looks at the 3DS.\n\n&gt; Supervisor: \"The box was opened, we can't let you return it.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"I didn't open the box, that woman that called you had to check whatever's inside the box.\"\n\n&gt; Supervisor: \"It doesn't matter, the box is still opened. There's fingerprints on it, we can't resell this.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Ma'am, I'm not the one who left the fingerprints on the console, your coworker opened the box to check if it was a valid return. You can go ask her yourself. I. Did. Not. Open. This. Box.\"\n\n&gt; Supervisor: \"I don't care if we opened it, it's still opened. I'm not gonna take this back.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Look, I left this thing in perfect condition, never opened. It's completely according to the return policy on your receipt. All I want to do is to trade this box in for a red one.\"\n\n&gt; Supervisor: \"I don't care what your reason is, it's still opened. Even if we took it, we don't have any red XLs to trade for you.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"There's like 10 red boxes RIGHT where I bought the black one!\"\n\n&gt; Supervisor: \"Well you should have looked closely when you bought your game. At this point I don't really need to help you.\"\n\n \n\n\nShe walks back before I can really say anything.\nAs of now, I am damn well very pissed off and will no longer frequent this store. I understand that some products that have been opened cannot be returned, but this has gone beyond ludicrous. Looks like I'll be lodging a very pissed off complaint to management to make sure this doesn't happen again, if not to me, then to the next poor sap who just wants a simple exchange.",

Whatever that meant. Needless to say I was shopping with the very person I despise day to day. Thankfully I love her.\n\nThe store we went to had a 30% off sale on the entire store. She had a text from the company saying something like \"receive 30% off until Saturday\" and insisted it meant she'd now get 60% off. When I said no, it most likely is just letting you know about the sale today, she said that was stupid they wouldn't text her about a sale. She went ahead and asked the cashier anyway, yep, I was right.\n\nIn waiting in the line up she looked around and stuffed two shirts under a shelf and said \"I don't think I'll get these.\" I took them and when we got to the cashier I said \"watch this\" to my family member, then turned to the cashier and said \"hi, in waiting in the line I changed my mind on these, thank you.\" How easy! \n\nThe best part is on the drive to shopping I told her stories about how customers act about their coupons and discounts expecting to combine multiple coupons for 80% off and she didn't believe me.. \n\nEDIT: Adding to the story. I also forgot that while shopping I came across a blazer that was originally $45, on for $24 and everything on clearance was also 30% off so I was incredibly excited. But, there was also a little clearance tag that was half torn and hardly stuck on for $14. It looked a little too good to be true and I've seen my fair share of tag switching in my life so I thought nothing of it. She insisted \"The tag says $14, the tag says!\" When I tried to explain that customers will switch tags she just kept shaking her head at me saying \"no, the tag says!\" We got to the cash, yeah, I was right.

Veggie's always result in a 5-minute wait so when I started to place my order the girl on the other end did her wait-spiel. \"Yep, that's ok.\" Then I told her my toppings and she said \"Oh!

After receiving a noise violation for the party my room mates and I threw the night before, we had decided greasy food was in order. \n\n\"Lenny's\" was decided upon after discussing the horrifying possibility of seeing your family photos displayed in Bracker Carrel. Also, Bracker Carrel sucks. But so does Lenny's. We now know this for a fact.\n\nWe waited for what seemed like hours on the padded seats in the front foyer. While sitting, we noticed and admired a heart-shaped Popeye plush pillow in the claw machine. Plans were made to attempt to extract said pillow from the machine. Men sporting khakis and fancy boat shoes were crowding the area, but the most confusing part was the sole female in the group dressed in the traditional Penn State female student garb (referred to as the \"SNUGG\"- Spandex, NorthFace, UGGs). \n\n**\"Yacht club?\"**\n*- Unknown*\n\nFinally we were seated. The waitress (Connie) gave us menus in a huff, and after a short wait she came back to take our drink orders.\n\n**\"Coffee and water, please\"**\n*- Everyone*\n\nEverything was going fine until I decided I wanted my cream \"on the side\", thus commencing the trying experience of being Served By Connie.  (Me, as our unspoken spokesperson, unfortunately got the brunt of her wrath and scorn.)\n\nThe notion that I would need to specify was laughable to Connie. She regarded the request with marked dismay.   \n\n**\"Well, yeah\"**\n*-Connie*\n\n\nSoon-ish after, she returned heaving a overly laden tray of coffee and miniature pitchers of cream for all.  She remarked grouchily that she couldn't fit all of the beverages on one tray and would have to make two trips.  This is where things really started to get interesting.  She demanded we \"participate\" by passing cups of coffee and the mini-pitchers down the table.  It was clear she took us for hooligans lacking a basic understanding of the physical limitations of human arms, and an unreasonable expectation that they should stretch several extra feet.  On her huffy second trip, we got to go through the overly coached (by Coach Connie herself) \"participation\" activity again.  Lucky us! \n\n**\"I feel like this is a team building exercise\"**\n*- Paige, Room mate*\n\n\nBefore she left the table to be nicer to other customers, Elizabeth (roomie) requested a spoon to stir her coffee (assuming our own put-upon Connie might just take some initiative and bring six). That was Elizabeth's first mistake.\n\n**Elizabeth**: *Could I get a spoon, please?*\n**Connie**:  *Uhhmmmmm.  I'll see what I can do...*\n\nWe waited for Connie to pull some strings. To be honest, I struggled a bit with my mini-pitcher and after spilling cream, I asked our Connie if she could bring some napkins and silverware.  *\"They're rolling them now.  We ran out.  I'll bring some out with your meal.\"*\n\n**Inner monologue: \"YOU'RE SERIOUSLY ASKING ME FOR SHIT RIGHT NOW.  YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE FOOD.  FUCK YOU.\"**\n\nEveryone was struck by the bizarre notion that silverware and napkins can't be given to customers separately and without being rolled.  Connie was confused.\n\n*Inner monologue: \"You'll get it when it's ready.\"*\n\nAs if we were asking her to serve us dangerously undercooked meat.  \n\n\n**\"I don't want a dog that's smarter than me\"**\n*-Overheard at nearby table*\n\nThen came the food, which in itself wasn't bad (though in retrospect it didn't feel good), but brought with it a slew of new offenses.  My skillet was carelessly (though possibly maliciously (let's give her the benefit of the doubt this time)) tossed into my open hand, nearly falling, and potentially burning myself and Paige (though it now seems that it may not have been heated to an appropriate temperature, and may not have burned anyone).\n\n~DEUX: Preparing for Hurricane Connie II (Coffee Refills)~\n\nAs the meal progressed, our mugs grew emptier and emptier.  We soon realized that something had to be done to help our poor persecuted Connie.  Arranging our mugs at the end of the table in an effort to alleviate our server's plight, Elizabeth spearheaded the plan to circumvent her strife.  When she finally came back, we asked for coffee refills and she asked us to pass our mugs down.  Hm.  Did she really not see them? Was it because she was so engrossed in her thoughts of being misunderstood by this table of sloppy, stupid youths (it should be noted that Connie can't be over twenty-five years old).  After being shown the mugs right in front of her, she huffed away and returned with a fresh pot of coffee.  \"I don't know whose is whose, so you'll have to figure that out,\" said Connie with her ever present air of impatience.  Little did she know we had prepared for that understandably confusing eventuality, and when told, she seemed taken aback.  \n\nQuick aside: I just looked up the name Connie, and discovered that it's short for Constance, which, if a persons name has any bearing on their character, might account for her steadfast crabbiness.\n\nWe got our coffee and coasted through the rest of our dining experience, with the exception of being forced to get up and search for a $25 Applebee's giftcard that the patron before us had left. There was no Applebee's giftcard, and even if there was, we all agreed we would have taken it. Everything else was pleasant and uneventful until Paige noted that Elizabeth's last piece of bacon looked like a man in a canoe.  Upon further inspection, we realized that he had a clear profile and very prominent lips. [man in canoe](http://i.imgur.com/GP1L0Q7.jpg?1)\n",

Just before Christmas in 2012, I was at a shop that's meant for bodies. My friend and I were looking at whatever kind of body lotions or scrubs she was hoping to buy, and we were approached by a sales assistant with some kind of offer.\n\nSales Assistant: Hey, have you heard about our offer? You buy the gift box where x amount of proceeds go to charity, and you get x% off your total purchase.\n\n\nFriend: Ah hmm, maybe I'll think about it.\n\nSales Assistant: (oblivious) Well it's a really good deal, do you want it?\n\nFriend: I'll think about it..\n\nSales Assistant: But it's better value to just buy the box, and plus it's going to charity.\n\nFriend: Well I don't really need the items in the box.\n\nSales Assistant: Then you should just donate to the charity.\n\nAt that point, my friend and I just kind of looked at her in a combination of shock/annoyance, but kept browsing. I went with her to the counter when she settled on something to buy, and a different sales assistant rang us up.\n\nDifferent sales assistant: Hey, did you hear about our box promotion?\n\nFriend: Yeah, I think I'll pass today, but thanks.\n\nDifferent sales assistant: Are you sure? It's such a good value and (*starts on her spiel*)\n\nFriend: No thank you\n\nDifferent sales assistant: Okay well I'm just gonna go ahead and check how much you'd be saving today if you bought the box.\n\nFriend: Please just ring up my items.\n\n\nAnd yeah, we finally walked out of that god damn store and I never went back.

        "text": "Yesterday I saw a therapist for the first time in my life. It was really hard for me to admit that I needed help, and I went about 6 months too late. After hours of looking online I found one who I thought I could trust. On her website she said she took my insurance, so I didn't check with my insurance company before going. \n\nWhen I got to the session, my therapist looked at my insurance card and said \"you should just double check with your insurance company that I am in your network after the session. I am sure you are fine, but it doesn't hurt to check\".\n\nSession goes great, and I felt like I found someone who could help me. Feeling confident for the first time in months I decide to double check if she is in my network. I call up Anthem and am put through to Chelsea. \n\nAfter searching for a few minutes, Chelsea tells me that she is not in my network and that I would have to pay full price to see this therapist ($130 a session) up to a $2000 deductible. She is really professional about it and offers to send me a list of people in my network, but I am really upset. It seemed like such a roadblock at the time and I really just felt like a huge idiot. I clearly got chocked up and thanked her for her help. She apologized to me, and I could tell that she really felt it, which already helped. \n\nI sat in my car staring at my phone, trying to muster the courage to call my new/old therapist to tell her about how much of an idiot I was and thank her. I was absolutely crushed, and honestly on the verge of having a breakdown. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of self agonizing, my phone rings and its a number I don't recognize. Its Chelsea, she had spent the last 20 minutes looking into my therapist and found that she had been mislabeled in the system and that she actually was in my network. I honestly have no idea how she figured it out. \n\nI am SO THANKFUL that Chelsea spent the extra 20 minutes (which she was no obligated to), and she really made my day. I told her manager what happened and how thankful I was for her compassion, but I just needed to tell someone else. \n\nThanks Chelsea! I hope you win a million dollars or something. ",

        "text": "Not Comcast. The other evil ISP. \n\nBut to be honest, while its expensive as hell, I usually have decent internet speeds and few issues. \n\nExcept yesterday I couldn't access my home security cameras from  work, and when I got home my two next door neighbors on either side both told me the hell they'd been having with their internet all day. I went inside my house and realized I had the same issues. Clearly there was a problem with our section of the street, possibly larger. \n\nNeighbors had called and been told there were no outages. One went to local office to upgrade their cable modem, and they splurged on a new wifi router. Still had the issue. \n\nSo when I called and spoke with the ISP tech, I informed her there was an outage. She said there wasn't, that their system showed everything was fine, and that someone would have to come to my house in two days. \n\nMe: ok. I won't be here. \n\nTech: then I need to cancel the appointment. \n\nM: no, just tell them to fix the lines. It's not my house, it's an outage. \n\nT: no, no one else has reported issues and we are showing no outage. \n\nM: actually, both my next door neighbors have reported issues. Can you look them up?\n\nT: no, we don't have access to their records unless they call. \n\nM: so 3 people that I know of have reported issues, but instead of sending a tech out to fix it, you're telling me there's no outage. \n\nT: correct\n\nM: isn't 3 adjacent homes having the same trouble at the same time a clear indication of an outage?\n\nT: we show it's all working, and no one else has called. \n\nM: they DID call. You guys made them buy a new modem. It didn't fix it, because there's an outage. \n\nThis went on for.... No exaggeration .... 45 minutes.  She refused to send my complaint to the engineering department, even after I did my best to explain that there was an outage affecting multiple customs that they weren't aware of. \n\nThree times, she refused to put me through to a supervisor. I finally snapped, yelled at her to stop wasting my time and to put me on with a supervisor immediately, that I wasn't taking no for an answer again. \n\n20 mins later, the supervisor picks up.  And immediately sent the info to engineering, and scheduled them to come out and fix it without my having to be there. \n\nI really try not to yell, but some people just need it. Sigh. ",

        "text": "Hello and welcome back to DP's Story Time Corner. Tonight is the gripping tale of prejudgement, condescension, and overall rude behavior. I am of course talking about [local tire shop]\n\n**Dramatis Personae**\n\n***\n\nMe................................................................................ Chris Pratt\n\nService Tech (ST).......................................................... David Spade\n\nService Manager (SM)................................................... Luke Wilson\n\n***\n\nI had been driving my car for a while. I loved it, but it was starting to have handling issues in the rain, and with winter approaching rapidly, I didn't want to get caught in a freak snowstorm on worn all season tires in a Ford Mustang. So I pulled into [Local Tire Shop], because I saw their special on Falken Ziex tires. Buy 3 get one free and a Visa gift card! Woo!\n\nI pulled in and elected to wait there, since I had my laptop. I continued playing games for about an hour, before the service tech came out with a worried expression on his face. Now this car is almost new. At the time of service, it had 34,000 miles, and I had recently changed the brakes and clutch (upgraded) at my local Ford dealer. I also got them to inspect the car fully. So imagine my surprise when Service Tech waves me over.\n\n&gt;ST: Mr. /u/DPNovitzky, we found a bunch of issues with your vehicle. \n\n&gt;Me: Well, that's no good. What's wrong?\n\n&gt;ST(Face lighting up): Well, when we checked your vehicle out, it had a lot of braking issues. The rotors are all warped, and the front calipers are frozen. The rear drums need to be replaced as well, and the lines need to be replaced as they have deteriorated. Also, your clutch is very worn, within a millimeter of material left.\n\nRemember how I mentioned that I had all these things done at a Ford dealer? I decided to have some fun with the dude.\n\n&gt;Me(Worriedly): Oh Jesus, that's not good. How much will this all cost me?\n\n&gt;ST(Seriously): Not much, we can save on some of the work. So with the tires, mounting and balancing, full brake work, and new clutch and cable (My clutch is hydraulic), and the oil change (Wait, what oil change?!), your total is $3,103 plus tax.\n\n&gt;Me: Do you accept Visa?\n\n&gt;ST(Thinking he got a sale): Of course we do!\n\n&gt;Me: Just a few things that I need to ask about. &lt;Pulling out my folder from my laptop bag. This folder includes ALL work done by Ford&gt; First off, how do you suppose I need new brakes? Ford JUST did the pads and rotors all around, swapping the rotors and installing new Baer calipers. 4 piston front, two rear. Also, the clutch is a brand new Exedy, with all work done by Ford. And why in the hell would I need a new cable? It's a hydraulic clutch.\n\n&gt;ST: Sir, you don't know crap about cars. I've been working on them for 15 years, and...\n\n&gt;Me: Listen Captain Jackass, I know more about my own car than you apparently do. Please get your manager. NOW. \n\nThere was no need, as I was getting rather loud by this point. The Manager came over and looked at me, then ST, and shook his head.\n\n&gt;SM: What the hell is going on over here?\n\n&gt;Me(Cutting ST off): Your jackass tech here is trying to sell me a ton of bullshit work. New brakes, clutch, oil change that I don't want or need, all for the lovely price of $3,000. Problem is I JUST had all of that work done at a Ford dealership, by the Ford Racing department who installed the brake upgrade and the clutch upgrade. So I need my keys back and my car around front. I am not shopping here anymore.\n\n&gt;ST: HE DOESN'T KNOW CARS.\n\n&gt;SM(To ST):You're a complete moron, you know? The guy obviously knows about his car, and with only 30k on it, you honestly think he NEEDS to get new calipers and rear drums? Drums on a car that doesn't need them? Pack your crap, go home. I'll tell you if you still have a job on Monday.\n\nAfter that, the manager turned to me and shrugged. \n\n&gt;SM: Listen, he was a moron, but the tires are on your car already. Tell you what, you pay for the tires alone, still the buy3 get one and a gift card, and I'll comp the work.\n\n&gt;Me: Sounds good.\n\nI was satisfied, and ended up spending $210. Not bad for 4 tires!",

        "text": "TL;DR: An extremely polite Computer Support person took over an hour of my time because she repeatedly asked me for the same information I had provided and leaving to look up information. I eventually found the answer myself.\n\nThis was so aggravating today. I kind of knew that my computer was too old to airFling to an iBlock, but just wanted to check with Computer Support. The person I spoke with was extremely polite! Absolutely no complaints there. However, the amount of time between questions and answers from her was ridiculous. The simple question that I had could have been answered in minutes. Instead, it took over 1 hour. Meanwhile, I kept researching online and eventually found what I needed to know. Long transcript of our conversation below.\n\n**BEGIN CONVERSATION: 3:15 PM**\nS- Thanks for contacting ComputerCare chat support. My name is S-. Please give me a moment to look over your information.\n\n Me: Hi S-!\n\n S- Thank you for your patience Kfoxie. How are you today? \n\nMe: I'm good! Just trying to move files from my laptop to my iPad, but when I go to AirFling, neither device recognizes the other. \n\nMe: My iPad recognizes my iPhone, but not the laptop. \n\nS- Oh no! I look forward to working with you to find a resolution. But before we begin, just in case we are disconnected, would you mind if I had a phone advisor give you a call back as soon as they are available so we can continue working with you?\n\n Me: Sure. ***-***-**** \n\nS- Great! Thank you! \n\nMe: My MacBook is a few years old, so I didn't know if that was the problem. \n\nS- I see you're chatting in about iPad does not recognize your laptop. I have created a case number for this conversation it is #8******* just in case you need to refer to it in the future \n\nS- If I understand your notes correctly, you're contacting us today because when you go to Airdrop, neither device recognizes the other, is that correct? \n\nMe: That's correct. \n\nS- No worries! I can definitely see why this would be of concern, and I'm going to assist you to the absolute best of my ability. We definitely want to get this resolved for you as quickly as possible so that moves your files from your laptop to your iPad, okay?  \n\nMe: That's great. \n\nS- I assure you we will work together and get this fixed.  \n\nS- Before I guide you through troubleshooting this, are there any steps that you've taken prior to chatting with me to resolve the issue?  \n\nMe: I made sure everything was updated and that my devices were set to Airdrop Everyone. \n\nS- Great! That’s a very important first step.  \n\nS- Do you know what iOS software version you’re using on your iPad?  \n\nMe: iOS 8.4 That's the software version, right? lol \n\nS- yes Kelsey that’s most recent version. Great job in having it installed already. \n\nMe: And the MacBook Pro is Version 10.7.5 \n\nS- Thank you Kelsey. I will make note.  \n\nS- Please give me a few moments to gather the best resources associated directly with your issue, then we will walk through the steps together. Will that be okay? \n\nMe: That's fine. \n\nS- Kelsey, do you have the option to turn AirDrop on and off on your iPad?  \n\nMe: Yes. \n\nS- Great! Are the devices close together?  \n\nMe: yes. They are right next to each other. \n\nS- Great! Thank you for that information.  \n\nS- Please give me a few moments I’m gathering the best resources for you.  \n\nS- Kelsey, 10.7.5 on your Macbook, is that the updated version? \n\nMe: Yes. \n\nS- Okay great. Let’s just go thru the steps again to turn on Air Drop. Is that okay? I want to walk through the steps you. \n\nMe: Sure. \n\nS- First let me ask, does your laptop recognize any of the devices?  \n\nMe: No. \n\nS- okay. Good information. Thank you. One moment pleases. \n \nS- Have you ever used your laptop with your iPhone or iPad before?  \n\nMe: I have not. That's why I was wondering if my MacBook was too old and was incompatible with the iphone 6 and ipad. \n\nS- Good point and observation.  \n\nS- Do you see the Air Drop option on your MacBook Pro \n\nMe: I did. There are no devices recognized. It is just the icon showing how my Macbook will be recognized by others. \n\nS- okay thank you for that information. I am making notes to better assist you. One moment please.  \n\nS- Mac computers need to have OS X Lion or later installed in order to use AirDrop \n\nMe: It is Lion 10.7.5 \n\nS- Question: Are you able to send and receive data via airdrop between your iPad and iPhone? \n\nMe: I am and I use that regularly. \n\nS- Okay great! Just checking before we proceed with any troubleshooting.  \n\nS- One moment please, I’m still retrieving resources for you to help resolve your issue. Thank you so much for your patience.  \n\nS- Kelsey, it appears we first need to update your MacBook in order for the AirDrop to work. Will that be okay?  \n\nMe: That's fine, but it says that there are no software updates available. \n\nS- okay. Let’s try this way. Select “About this Mac” and then select “software update”.  \n\nMe: Already done it. After looking for updates, it says there are none available. \n\nS- Okay, thanks for checking for me. One moment please. \n \nS- Have you tried restarting your MacBook Pro? If not, let’s restart it please. \n\nMe: Already tried it. \n\nS- Okay, thank you Kfoxie.  \n\nS- Do you have *The MacBook Pro (17-Inch Late 2008) or the white MacBook (Late 2008) ?  \n\nMe: 13-inch Late 2011 \n\nS- Okay. Thank you for that information. One moment please while I consult with an advisor for the MacBook Pro department.  \n\nS- One moment please while I connect with that department, okay?  \n\nMe: that's fine. \n\nS- Thank you.  \n\nS- Thank you for your patience. I’m connecting with an Advisor for MacBook Pro department now.  \n\nMe: Thank you. \n\nS- You’re welcome. Thank you for contacting us. We are help to help you.  \n\nMe: Is this advisor going to be on the same chat? \n\nS- Once connected, we can transfer the chats. No problem.  \nS- Kfoxie, when you connect your iPhone or iPad to your MacBook Pro do you get an alert that asks “Trust this computer”? \n\nMe: no. \n\nS- Okay, just checking because when you connect your iPhone or iPad to a new computer or another device attempting to access the files of your iOS device, you’ll see an alert asking you to verify that you trusted the connected device.  \n\nMe: How would that factor in to airdrop and recognizing devices? \n\nS- Just checking to make sure. \n\nS- I have an advisor now. One moment while I update them on your issue. \n\nS- Thank you for your patience Kelsey. The AirDrop feature only available for OS X Yosemite 10.10. That is why you are experiencing problems with AirDrop. \n\nMe: So 1 hour ago, when I asked if my OS was the problem because my computer was too old to be compatible with airdrop for ipad, that was correct? \n\nS- First we had to do the basic troubleshooting to ensure we did not miss any steps with set up. Then we wanted to check with our MacBook Pro Team about compatibility. I wanted to make sure before saying it was not compatible. \n\nMe: “In order to transfer files between a Mac and and an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch your iOS device needs to include a lightning connector your iOS device needs iOS 7 or later installed your Mac needs to be a 2012 or later model with OS X Yosemite installed Your Mac and iOS device both need bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on. You do not have to be connected to a specific Wi-Fi network.” \n\nS- I apologize for the time spent. I just wanted to make sure we got out the correct answer to you.  \n\nMe: Just found that on a support site. \n\nMe: Thanks anyways. \n\nS- Before I let you go, I want to be certain that you are satisfied that we have addressed all of your concerns today. Would you say that you are satisfied with my assistance today? \n\nS- Hello Kfoxie are you still here?  \n\nMe: I would say that I am unsatisfied with your level of knowledge at this time, as it took over an hour to determine that my computer was a year too old to support airdrop. That seems like a basic piece of information to know when working in the capacity that you are in. Especially considering that the same question was asked multiple times despite having given you that information previously. Pair everything with the fact that you spent a lot of time looking for information, I would hope that you are still in training. You have been perfectly polite, and I appreciate that the knowledge was found eventually. \n\nMe: So overall, my question was answered. That answer was found by me while looking for printed help, but it was answered. So thank you.\n\n**END CONVERSATION: 4:30PM**\n\nEdit: got rid of Names",

I don't know how much you know about the subject, but it's broken down into three parts: hardware, power, and eliquid. \n\nThis particular shop is well known for being a tad overpriced on the hardware, but they make up for it with a higher quality liquid and lower cost replacement parts. They've earned my business, and they've done it well enough to earn the business of others as well, becoming the first non-chain shop to own multiple locations in the area. \n\nAlmost a month ago, I foolishly bought a box mod from them. I say foolish because it cost me $175 I couldn't afford to spend. My fault. But, two days later, this mod broke. It was sent to them with faulty electronics. When I took it back, I asked about the refund policy and was met with an immediate \"we're gonna send it back and have it fixed\". Question deflected. \n\nI'd much rather have the money back and have a new box mod. They can fix the old one and resell it while I use another one. It made sense to me. I was told no on this as well. \n\nWhen it came time to send it back, the shop something or other (higher than a manager, lower than a CEO, but does all the CEO work), he missed the deadline by a week. Missed is the wrong word, let's just say didn't do it because his partner wanted to send his in as well. As of my submission, it will have been three weeks since they shipped it off, accumulating a month (so far) total wait time on a problem that, with enough studying and maybe a small bit of practice on other things, I could have eventually done on my own, in a shorter time frame. \n\nI'm having trouble deciding if they still deserve my business.

See you on Monday!\"\n\nMe: get home and see that shirt is covered with stains and is questionably old\n\nThe shirt: http://i.imgur.com/WtrZhu3.jpg\n\nThe picture doesn't look very bad, but I took a quick picture before I immediately tossed it in the laundry.\n\nI'm sincerely hoping this doesn't foreshadow my time with the company.",

This lady that I HATE going to (I like the boy better, he doesn't ask and he goes over it with me to make sure no slip ups) was there.\n\nAnyway, I had my card out and she gave me a few weird looks. \"That'll be 5--\" I don't remember the exact amount with change. So I swipe it and yes RENT TIME.\n\nBefore I get it though, as it's printing, a lovely conversation ensues.\n\nLady: *eyes narrowed* How did you get so much money?\n\nMe: Huh?\n\nLady: Because if you stole someone else's money I'll call the cops!\n\nMe:...ask me the question again.\n\nLady: How. Did. You get. That money.\n\nMe: *leans in* Because. I have. A JOB.\n\nLady blinks as if she didn't think about that, and I plucked the MO from her hands.\n\nTbh I don't think she believes me.

We shopped and in true 15 year old fashion I moaned, groaned, and finally begged to go sit on the bench.\n\nYeah sure M+H just go.\n\nFINALLY.\n\nI sat on the bench in front of the hair cutting place, and wiggle my feet. They ache, as I had tennis that day.\n\nAnyway, that day I had worn my polo from school and slacks, but had switched my shoes for my slip on crocs. So I'm sitting there, waiting and this really old man...about 60 or so, sat near me with his buggy.\n\nOM: Hello there!\n\nMe: Um. Hi.\n\nOM: So, having a good day?\n\nMe: Yeah pretty good.\n\nOM: Ah that's good. \n\nThen we talk about random things, then I rant as I am wont to do, and then he goes\n\nOM: Oh you are a smart young lady! Do you mind giving me your phone number? I'd like to talk to you more!\n\nMe: ...I...can't?\n\nOM: Oh is your phone busted? \n\nMe: ...I'm not supposed to give my phone out to strangers.\n\nHe looked confused and that's when my mom showed up with my sister. \n\nMom: Come on, you've still got to study for that test.\n\nMe: You KNOW I'll pass it, studying's stupid.\n\nOM: *shocked face*\n\n...it wasn't until much later I realize he was flirting with me. He was okay, I guess, it wasn't a 'creepy factor' like he knew I was young, more like he thought I was an older woman and wanted to flirt around.\n\nSo, there's a tale on how I adulted too much. And a tale on how too little I have adulted.\n\nThere are so many.\n\nAnother TL;DR: Man flirts. I rant. Man tries to flirt more. I have to study, sir.",

I am however 21, going on 22 this Aug (YAY!). A year back, I got into PC games again and my cousin showed me The Witcher. It's rated M, but that's okay because I can honestly tell you I've seen worse on the internet.\n\n*ahem*\n\nAnyway, so I go to shopping mall, and it is a small town, however there are new people moving in lately. I pick up the box for The Witcher, wave at my friend in Electronics (he talks about Pokemon and FF with me) before heading to Cashier as E was swamped.\n\nI head to the only empty check out line, and the lady smiles at me 'sweetly'.\n\nOh God. Please. No.\n\nLady: Young lady you can't buy this, this is for ADULTS. You'll need your daddy or mommy.\n\n\nI s2g do not condescend me lady.\n\nI stare at her for a while before fishing out my State ID.\n\nAnd yeah, I can admit, I've been told I look 15 or younger. I just get irrationally insulted whenever people call me 'sweetie' or act like I need my mom to come sign junk.\n\nHah.\n\nAnyway she gave me this weird amused look like I had stolen my mom's ID and looked it over before apologizing and start to ring it up.\n\nA friend who is a cashier there walked by and LAUGHED AT ME. I threw a piece of paper (we're the same age, they find this hilarious because I'm so tiny) at them.\n\nAnyway, the thing that finally got me was when I went to leave, I took my ID and she gripped the receipt so I couldn't leave.\n\nShe had this phony 'sweet' look again.\n\nLady: You know, if you dress like an adult you'll be treated like an adult.\n\nI had jeans on and a t shirt with no logo on it, it was just grey, and my walking shoes from the place I work at.\n\nI glared at her and said, \"Pretty sure I dress adult enough to be treated like one at my JOB.\"\n\nWhen I took my receipt her face was shocked, either because I HAD a job (wow I'm so INSULTING OMG) or because I was so rude (Don't care, been insulted worse lady).\n\nAnd that was my fun times buying a video game.\n\n",

        "text": "Me:\n\nWondering if you'd be willing to help. I have a pair of Rampart Long shorts for a couple years. I LOVE them! I was in Vancouver for Canada Day and saw a pair of Rampart Long shorts on sale. With the great exchange rate (I'm American), I jumped on it. I got the same exact size (32) as my older pair not even thinking to try them on (because they're the same, right? Why would A*** change the cut on such a perfect pair shorts?). Well, of course, A*** changed the cut on a perfect pair of shorts. The problem is, I am not able to return to Vancouver so I will not be able to return these shorts to the retailer. Can you swap me for a larger pair (34?)? I still have the receipt. Posting them in would kill the deal I got, but I'd rather wearable shorts. BTW, bring back the cut of old--the new cut on these shorts SUCK! Thanks!\n\nThem:\n\nHi Desertdungarees,\n\nThank you for contacting A***. What is the SKU of your shorts? It should be on our tag attached to the shorts.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nA*** Service Team - J\nA*** Equipment\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMe:\n\nJ,\n\nHere's what I've got:\n\nCA#34438\n\nThere's another number on the same tag that says:\n\n12140-73143-11/14\n\n174/80A(32)\n\n \nThe receipt has the following UPC #: 806955792171\n\nAny of these numbers what you're looking for?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDesertdungarees\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThem:\n\nHi Desertdungarees,\n\nWe don't exchange products unles they are purchased directly from our website, are brand new, with tags still attached. Obviously we can't exchange a discontinued product for a current one (even if it's just the colour that is discontinued).\n\nI understand that this product was not purchased directly from our website, but does it still have all the tags attached to it? If so, you should be able to see what the SKU number is from the attached tag. If you don't have these original tags, we will not be able to work an exchange for this product.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nA*** Service Team - J \nA*** Equipment\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMe:\n\nJ,\n\nCool. I don't imagine I still have those tags. The product IS new, however. I was just hoping that you'd swap them out for larger size (not a discontinued style) as a courtesy (and brownie points) especially seeing how pricey they are. I am NOT trying to take advantage of anything.\n\n \n\nDesertdungarees\n\nThem:\n\nSorry Desertdungarees,\n\nWithout the original tags, we can't restock them in our warehouse.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nA*** Service Team - J\nA*** Equipment\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMe:\n\nJ,\n\n \n\nI get it. You don't have to help me out and you shouldn't have to...but you are A***. Would you really have the lack of a label stop you? You really couldn't have another label printed in house? You mean to tell me that A*** is THAT concerned with reselling this one pair of shorts? Doesn't A*** hand out a bunch of clothing to the homeless in Vancouver anyway? Wouldn't, as an organization, A*** back their high cost/high quality brand image with exceptional and out-of-the-way customer service? Maybe I'm spoiled; most American companies are only too quick to step up. But I do totally get it.\n\n \n\nThanks, however, for the prompt replies,\n\n \n\nDesertdungarees\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThem:\n\nWe want to help our customers as much as we can and we're happy to discard an item and replace it if there is any warranty issue that would not be worth repairing. However, we don't provide free items outside of our sponsorship program. If the shorts that you purchased in Canada had the tags still attached, we would have been willing to bend the rules for you, but unfortunately, what you are requesting is something that we can't do.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnyway, it sucks that a company that has a reputation for high end, quality gear is so insular from their consumer. It could happen to any of us. The waist fit. Suppose I tried them on in the store and the waist fit but I was unsure about the rest of the shorts after wearing them for a day? Yes, I tossed the tags but they are clutter and if you're a manufacturer you print new tags. You don't disregard your consumers in that way. Anyways, venting about shitty customer service, I suppose.\n\nThe name of the employee listed, btw, I'm sure is an anonymized name so I left it in.",
