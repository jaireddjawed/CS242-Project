I plan on using a Greyhound a couple times for moving small items since it's cheap but I have some big items that are fragile. \n\nWhat's the cheapest way to go about this?",

        "text": "Hey r/frugal! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, recently I went to this store with my girlfriend, and it sold vintage and older video games and consoles. All the way from old Atari's up through PS3's, and everything in between. So, as I was going through the collections I realized how much fun I had playing these games as a kid, and I remembered something I had heard about game emulation and decided to give it a try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went home and downloaded a simple piece of software called OpenEmu, and then visited this website called Vimm.net . And I couldn't believe it! They had EVERY SINGLE VIDEO GAME I HAD EVER PLAYED AS A KID. I loved it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I downloaded them, hooked my computer up to my tv with an HDMI cable, and proceeded to have the best time of my life. My girlfriend and I made some snacks, and it felt like we were kids again. We were going through the old libraries visiting things we both had played (things like the SpongeBob Movie game for GameCube, old Mario Party games, the Family Guy video game for PSP, Simpsons Hit and Run, etc.). It was an incredible bonding experience, and we've been playing nearly every night since!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I would've given it a chance sooner, but I'm happy I finally did. And it's completely free, and absolutely an amazing way to relive your childhood. If you have a controller for Playstation, Xbox, or Switch, they'll automatically hook up with Bluetooth and you can calibrate them all to work with any older video game. It's all extremely easy to get running in less than 30 minutes, even for someone who is not very technologically advanced (just check out some YouTube videos if you need any pointers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure if you get your friends or SO, or even just by yourself you'd have a blast! And the bonding really comes from experiencing somebody else's childhood with them for just a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, and I hope someone enjoys this as much as I have. I just wanted to share and hopefully make somebody else as happy as I am :) Have a great day! :)",

It’s kinda embarrassing but menstrual products are so expensive nowadays and honestly using diapers as pad has saved me lots of money. They also hold up pretty well on my heavy days. So I thought I’d share this since yea I know there’s moms out there too that just have a pile of unused diapers laying around.",

The car has over 300k kilometers so she should've known this was coming up. \n\nWe had recently talked about her moving in but I feel like we need to have a more serious discussion regarding saving habits and priorities. \n\nAm I wrong to think she out of balance with her spending priorities? How do I even approach this conversation? I'm not saying she shouldn't be attending any weddings, but if it's a distant relative or a friend you don't really keep in touch with, maybe it's best to decline and send a small gift?",

        "text": "I only use natural gas for heat and hot water. Last year my friend's husband turned down the thermostat on my hot water tank for me. To me it makes no sense to heat water er so hot that it burns to the touch then have to add cold water to cool it off. Instead its set at the hottest temp I can tolerate it at.\n\nAs for my heat, I have not moved the needle of my thermostat in at least 5 years. And according to their own documentation I'm using less gas now than I did last year at this time. \n\n All this being said, I had to print off a copy of my bill to submit with some paperwork, I have everything set to paperless billing. As it came up I see this box across the page informing me that because of my gas usage my $74 a month budget amount is increasing to $137 effective April 1st! Seriously, how does the budget amount almost double when you're using less. Has there been a massive price increase that I am otherwise unaware of? \n\nI just lost $226 a month in food stamps, and now my budget amount is going to increase $63?!?  I'm seriously thinking that I'm going to have to wear more with layers and heat my water on the stove. I have two electric space heaters and we're going into warmer months so it wouldn't kill me just have them suspend my service.\n\nI am hugely overwhelmed right now, and on top of all of this the whole reason I found out was because I pulled a copy of the bill to send in to HUD which means I'm probably going to get a rent increase on top of this.\n\nHas anybody else gone through this or is currently going through this?",

        "text": "I’m asking as a consumer. \n\nI recall in the early days of internet shopping, you were only required to pay sales tax if the retailer had a physical location in your state. So for example, if the warehouses were in New Jersey, if you were ordering from a different state you didn’t have to pay sales tax. \n\nSince then, states and counties and municipalities have adapted to capture revenue from e commerce in all kinds of ways, which I think is a good thing. \n\nNow I am proud to be someone who pays taxes, but I am curious about what rules are now. I do a lot of online shopping, and I get charged all different rates.  \n\nRecently, I was about to purchase kitchen appliances in Chicago, where I Iive. I was prepared to pay the combined 10.25 percent tax rate, which was quite a lot since I was spending a few thousand dollars. \n\nBut they told me it’s on backorder. So I went online and found a store in North Carolina, and I called them to get an estimate on lead time. When he told me the total and it was less then I expected, he said “since we don’t advertise in Illinois, there’s no tax.”  \n\nWhich is really surprising to me.  Now I’m not going to go through life now avoiding taxes (we need it for public goods) but I also know that governments specifically develop tax policies to incentivize certain consumer behaviors, and it’s usually because there’s an economic advantage to it. For example, in NYC clothes and shoes under $110 are not taxed. \n\nSo that being said, what are the situations exactly in which we are not required to pay sales tax.",

The basic tie to frugality is that the worse your posture is the harder and more expensive everything is going to be in the future for the kids. \n\nRequest for ideas:\n\nMy kids are a freshman in HS and a freshman in college. One son, one daughter. They both have bad posture. It is partly hereditary and partly their life choices such as slouching and playing on their phones, sitting on beds to do homework. They both do some exercise but this doesn’t counteract the slouching and posture issues. \n\nThey have all the tools and resources for having good posture. I provide PT and training appointments. I hand them exercise bands, show them how to use them and rub their backs. \n\nWhat would you say or do to them if they were your kids? I know that being an overbearing parent never works so I try to not bug them about it too much. Maybe I need to set aside a time to talk to them about issues and they can also raise any issues they have at that time and then I just check in and raise it over again? \n\nIf I was a single parent I would take away their phones. If that is something you recommend, tell me in your comments how to discuss this w my husband, their father. He doesn’t have the same approach as I do. Thanks",
