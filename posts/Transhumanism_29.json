        "text": "The [Transhumanist Bill of Rights](http://transhumanistparty.org/TranshumanistBillofRights.html) (of the Transhumanist Party) seems mostly dedicated to new rights, to someday add to from the Bill of Rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, only a kinda vague \"morphological freedom\" note relates to freedom of speech, and this bothers me. (\"...to do with one's... intelligence... whatever one wants\" implies freedom of thought.)\n\nI think freedom of thought is an essential part of a politically acceptable Transhumanist future. Article 18 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) includes this freedom, and freedom of speech (in any media) is in Article 19, but I want to see it in the context of Transhumanism and an AI future.\n\nI think freedom of speech, or the right \"to communicate ideas and experiences to other sentient beings through an honest medium\"  should be guaranteed.\n\nI think the \"honest medium\" must be specified because if we abolish (involuntary) suffering in the future, then we must abolish overly rude language, or even unpleasant \"experience messages\" sent in the VR world. An AI of some sort will mediate human communication, but we need that AI to be honest and to *ultimately let the sender and recipient decide.* The AI must know the recipient and analyze the message, looking for \"triggers\" or other stuff (please take this somewhat seriously: we might be having realistic gladiator fights in VR where we feel real pain). The AI would then somehow warn the recipient in an ideal and honest way. The recipient can choose to trust the sender and the AI's analysis, ignore obvious spam/trolling/stuff, or get a bigger suffering-free analysis, but the unanticipated experience can't be forced.\n\nRight now most mediums are \"brutally honest,\" but we can block stuff we don't like online, and according to all the paranoid anti-censorship/shill subreddits, the internet is dishonest. I hope in the future I will know whether I'm talking to a bot or a human, and I hope I can explore a creative VR world of volunteers' dreams without nightmares or censorship.\n\nOh a related concept: [the bubble.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdxzvQG3aic) I want everyone to know how the analysis works and to have the ability to ignore it.",

Many people would not be willing to give up sex, drugs, food, music, and some positive stress with being human. Especially why would you give that up if you could just perfect the human body instead of just getting rid of it. There is good chance you would lose much of the good things about being human if you traded in your body for a machine body. This could likely lead the human race splitting off into multiple species. There are many methods of becoming Transhuman and I do not think that one single method will win out but what does this subreddit think?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/5bdrji/why_its_not_easy_being_green_a_response_to_one_of/",
        "text": "Back in September, futurist and Transhumanist presidential candidate Zoltan Istvan ran an article over on Motherboard Magazine, addressing the cross section between transhumanism and veganism. In this article, he endorsed several near-future solutions for modifying Human food consumption, one of which was creating photosynthetic people. This was not the first time Zoltan has advocated for Human photosynthesis, but to my knowledge he has never gone beyond promoting it to actually explaining how a Human being could possibly derive enough calories to survive from photosynthesis alone. I would like to take a moment to explain why I think this is not a viable idea.\n\nAnimals evolved to be heterotrophs for a reason; moving uses a lot of energy, and photosynthesis just isn’t up to the job. When fully exposed to sunlight, one square meter of leaves will generate about 1.3 grams of sugar (specifically glucose) per hour.  The average Human possesses 2 square meters of skin, so if a photosynthetic person were completely naked and had every square inch of their skin exposed to the sun, they could produce 2.6 grams an hour. A photosynthetic nudist living in a solarium that blasted them with artificial sunlight twenty-four hours a day would produce 62.4 grams of sugar. At four calories a gram, that much sugar would provide 249.6 calories. Unfortunately, this is woefully inadequate for anyone hoping to give up food entirely. The average adult male needs 2500 calories a day, ten times the maximum amount they could get from photosynthesis. A smaller person would, of course, need fewer calories, but their skin would also have less surface area so I’m going to assume these two factors would scale more or less proportionally within the range of Human body sizes. \n\nAnd of course, 250 calories is the best case scenario, with 100 percent of skin exposed to the sun 100 percent of the time. This is wildly unrealistic. If we instead suppose a more plausible scenario with 40 percent of skin exposed to sunlight for a few hours a day, we only get 12 calories. That’s less than half of a percent of what an average person would need, which wouldn’t even be noticeable. That’s literally four M&amp;Ms. \n\nThere is, of course, an animal that uses photosynthesis, a sea slug known as the Eastern Emerald Elysia. Its solution to this problem was basically to become a leaf. Its body is flattened, broadened, and elongated to provide a huge amount of surface area relative to its size. A Human would have to do something similar to get a decent amount of calories from photosynthesis. They would need a long, widening tail dragging behind them like the train of an elaborate wedding dress. It might look interesting, but it would be highly impractical, especially if it had pain receptors. I would dread getting it caught in doors. \n\nThere are other issues with Human photosynthesis as well. In order for photosynthetic skin to get enough CO2 to work, it would need to be about a hundred times more porous. I’m not sure if there would be any medical side effects from that, but at the very least it would make already weird looking green skin look even weirder. Injecting chloroplasts into skin cells would also not affect their resistance to UV damage. Someone spending the excessive amount of time in the sun needed for photosynthesis would be at high risk for skin cancer and other conditions. I suppose this could be solved by engineering the skin to molt when it became too badly damaged, but now we’re just piling speculative modifications on top of each other, and if we’re doing that we might as well just skip straight to after the singularity when we’re beings of pure energy who don’t need to worry about sustenance at all. \n\nFinally, even with photosynthetic skin, a person would still need to eat. Photosynthesis cannot produce the protein, vitamins, and minerals the Human body needs to survive and can only be acquired through diet. So if you have to eat anyway, what’s the bloody point of all this? I’m not saying photosynthetic Humans aren’t possible, they are, but they seem insanely impractical. That may not stop everyone from doing it, but it would stop most people from doing it and it definitely wouldn’t have any effect on global food security. It would require strict dedication to a lifestyle that would be far more demanding than veganism or any other dietary restrictions, and I doubt many people would be willing or able to make such an austere commitment to such a radically unnatural way of life just to reduce their ecological footprint a little. Some of you may disagree, and be willing to live like a plant if it’s for the good of the Earth. Be forewarned though, if you decide to live outdoors as a green nudist with huge folds of porous, UV damaged skin that needs to be periodically molted, you may experience some social ostracization.           \n",

The best way I can sum it up is this way; I am terrified. Change is always hard to accept, but I'm looking at the rapid growth of those field and how exploitable it is. Our future can be at stake. There is SO much that can go wrong. We can't just go all willy nilly and augment ourselves. We can't just build AI to help us. We can't build a global neural lace for the one simple reason.\n\nThe world isn't read yet, and it won't be for a long (very long) time. \n\nIf we go full speed ahead and start making transhumanism happen to quick, the world will like it, but the bad guys, will hit this technology so hard, it will make our house of cards only taller. \n\nSpecifically speaking...we need to be conservative overall but I'm going to focus on two emerging technologies instead, the human genome augments and robots. I am scared that people out of liberal rage and momentum will take things too far and start augmenting the human genome without responsibility. Getting rid of life threatening diseases is a god send, and will save a lot of heart ache, BUT ladies and gentlemen, one thing leads to another, and since technology is flowing so fast, is expect designer babies to happen. And you could argue \"we can regulate it, moron\" but have you even thought that there are back room projects, government CIA Area 51 type areas where they will cross these moral boundaries? What happens when augmented troops show up on the battlefields of the wars? How do we respond? What happens when they cross things too far and make a better race of humans than us? What happens when they start poking at human conscious, and alter that makes us human? The consequences of genetic manipulation will have effects in us for centuries. If we choose to aggressively engineer our genome and get a class of enhanced humans I guarantee that a hierarchy will be established. Somewhere down the line a \"napoleon\" of the augment community is going to want to expand their power, and when it happens so, the world we know will take a miserable turn.\n\nNext topic: Robots. These guys. Huh. Okay let me start off by saying Drone Warfare is 101% okay. I support it fully as long as it doesn't replace soldiers and becomes more beneficial than putting men in the ground. I read as article a while back, (id link if I could find it) about Obama looking into AI for the security of America and how Pilots are expecting to be replaced by drones by 2037 or something like that. Scary stuff. When I say robots I'll be talking specifically about combat drones (but domestic use shares some points too). In my eyes combat robots should never develop advanced AI, infact they shouldn't even ever exist. Wars are meant to be fought by humans. We start them, we should finish them. It's who we are as a species. People die, it's tragic yes, but when it comes down to it, wars will no longer be wars when drones replace us. There is no value there because robots have no value. They don't live like us. God forbid (I say that but I'm agnostic) they start talking and behaving like us. They don't have stories to share, families to take care of or LOVE to give. We should never let our conflicts be dictated by a AI system or robot because if they are designed to respond to humans like humans, they will do terrible things. We cannot trust a computer. I love humans to much to see us he replaced by some stone grey computer that controls an army  of troops. \n\nFinal thoughts. The things that make us human are our flaws. Our ability make mistakes and learn from them. What happens when we take away these flaws? That's not transhumanism, that's a campaign to undermine the human spirit. I refuse to grow up in a world where we are separated by hierarchy due to who has better genes. I refuse to grow up in a world where robots take us over, and fight the conflicts we should be doing. In my eyes, transhumanism is less about a vengeful fight against our flaws, and instead a loving embrace of them. Enhancing the good and bad in us to make us something more human // me being in highschool allows me to see the world from the bottom to the top. I haven't experienced success or made large sums of money. I am just a baby. I've got a long way to go, and I hope my life is spent in a good little world, free of constant abuse of power. I'm hopeful someone will read this and understand my perspective. If you do, I'll think you'll understand how big of a deal this is to my generation (it is sad though that most people aren't informed about science and global events because they are too busy being distracted by the wrong things).\n\nI want to grow up in that kind of world where we understand ourselves better and improve conservatively. We should make careful choices to help this planet that has given us so much. I hope a good person takes the way forward and leads us to a better place. Take it slow humanity. Like I said before it's a first date. Don't rush it. Give it all your attention and be careful how you interact with it. Trust me, my first date didn't go like that whatsoever 😂 \n\nThat's all.",
