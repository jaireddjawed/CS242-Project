Great tasting coffee.\n\nTHen i got a baratza encore. I tried it on the recommended french press setting and it tasted much weaker. Ok, I looked it up and apparently sometimes the recommended setting isn't the best for your specific grinder. Might have grinded it too coarse or something and it loses flavour. So I tried multiple settings and found the one that provided the most flavorful french press brew. Yet it STILL did not taste anywhere near as powerful as the coffee I grinded at starbucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is that? Or is it in my head?",

I drink out of an Ember mug at 122 degrees, so it’s not necessarily a result of the coffee cooling down, but it does seem to only come out towards the end of the cups. Since this is new, I’m not sure if this is over/under extraction or something else? Anyone with some experience with this have any ideas what I need to do to correct for it? I’m guessing it’s under extracted so grinding a little finer should fix it, but I’m not confident in that.",

        "text": "I started my journey into the world of good coffee about 1 1/2 years ago. I joined this sub in hopes of learning more about what kind of grinder I should get. I was determined to get a good grinder, but was reticent to buy a hand grinder. I was convinced that I wouldn't want to \"work that hard\" for my coffee, first thing in the morning. After asking questions and reviewing many posts, I finally settled on the Baratza Encore; it was electric and struck a balance between quality, price, and repairability/longevity. Then, a few months back, I had to start going into the office again. I wanted to keep having great coffee so I bought a setup for the office, as well. Not wanting to annoy my coworkers with the noise of an electric grinder, I bought a KINGrinder K6. It took a few days to break it in and learn the best way to use it, but now I love it. The adjustability and consistency go way beyond my Encore. I have considered doing the burr upgrade on my Encore to see if that changes things. But, for now, I'm bringing my KINGrinder home every day so I can use it to grind at home and the office. It also has a decent espresso range, which has opened me up to experimenting with my little thrift store espresso machine again, though I'll admit that it is a little more work to grind at espresso levels. I write all of this in hopes of letting someone else know that hand grinders are great! Sure, it's a little bit of work, but who among us couldn't use a little more cardio in our day. Though, it's really not that difficult and the resulting quality you get for the price you pay is leaps and bounds better than most budget electric options out there.",

I fill the switch to the top all three times. Sometimes I forget and it steeps a little longer, but I'm still happy. The 30 grind size means it drains super fast especially with the water-first hack. \n\nIs it perfect? Maybe not but it brews enough for two and I have been happy with the coffee. I'm not the pickiest though. I also really don't like when it's too acidic, so my palette leans away from that side of things.\n\nJust wanted to share the recipe for any other beginners out there struggling to get tasty coffee.\n\nSo, it's really the 30:30:3:3",

Occasionally pressure will drop and the flow slows down and it reminds me to clean the screen and group head. I also regularly backflush it.\n\nI rarely use the steam wand, but a few months ago it was used and that caused the pressure to drop and no amount of cleaning or priming would fix it. I found a Whole Latte Love youtube video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipvBdWaVzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipvBdWaVzQ)) showing how to disassemble and descale the solenoid valve and that did the trick. It was working perfectly again up until yesterday when I used the steam wand again.\n\nNow it's back to having the low pressure problem. Before I take it apart again and descale everything, I want to see if any of you have other thoughts about what could be wrong. Is there anything else I should be checking or cleaning? I'm doubtful lack of descaling for the last few months is the issue, as the pressure problem came on suddenly after using the steam wand.\n\nThanks!",

A review on another tool, which may be more interesting because of it's higher specificity, has been done by James Hoffmann (the Coffein Meter).\n\nMy point is, that in my mind, metal cations could as well be from the metal used in boiling the water, burrs grinding the (slightly acidic Coffee), paper Filters, and other stuff. Of course, you probably could calibrate your device with such data, tho I wonder how much these variables are dependend on external factors, therefore a calibration being close to useless. Also, I don't see anybody publishing their calibration results...\n\nSo, what exactly does a TDS Meter tell us?",

Also, are there any hacks to get the grind size a little finer?",

I have certainly changed the flavor of the coffee, but only in extremes.\n\nFirst, grind size keeping brew time at 2min:\n1. 18, coffee was quite acidic/sour\n2. Dialed finer to 16 and coffee became more bitter with low acid/sourness\n\nStuck with 16 and tried brew times starting at 1:30 and dropping to 1:00, still mostly bitter. Perhaps overextracted? \n\nOnly thing left is water temp (I keep at 99C/boiling currently) but I hear varying opinions on the effectiveness of that compared to grind size and time. \n\nI was hoping I could hear opinions on if I'm doing this shifting/experimenting correctly? I feel rather rudderless trying to figure this out and want to be sure I'm not missing something glaringly obvious.\n\nThank you!",

They are called non-medicinal since they are not prescribed by a verified and certified health professional and alter the normal functioning of the body systems. Most people are not aware that any activity can be addictive, whatever the case.\n\nAddiction refers to the constant reliance on something to operate normally. In this context, anything can be addictive, such as food, going to the gym, and also certain behaviors. It may go to the extent of being addicted to a person, typically referred to as obsession.\n\nLet’s cut to the chase and expound on the adversities of excessive caffeine consumption to the human anatomy.

I'd been using two stainless steel moka pots (2-cup and 6-cup, stainless steel) that have been working flawlessly.\n\nHowever, I decided to get a 3-cup one since I needed a little bit more brew, but none that I bought seem to be functioning well. They start steaming and sputtering right from the beginning, and only fill half of the upper compartment with (burned) coffee. Today I bought my THIRD 3-cup moka pot (different prices, different stores, all aluminum though) and the issue continues.\n\nI already had to return two of them to the stores, but it's really unlikely that all three 3-cup moka pots that I bought are malfunctioning. I spent hours googling all the possible solutions, but nothing helped. I use low heat, I experimented with grind size, screwed the lid on tight, tried cold-hot water, taking the pot apart and cleaning it, but nothing worked. Is there something that I am not doing right? I assume that it has to do with not enough pressure building up. But they are brand new so it would be very odd if all of them required a gasket or funnel replacement. It's also really strange because I didn't have that issue with my 2-cup and 6-cup.\n\nThis is driving me crazy because I can't figure out what's going on. I don't think that all those mokas can be defective. I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me with this! Thank you!",

I'd been using two stainless steel moka pots (2-cup and 6-cup, stainless steel) that have been working flawlessly. \n\nHowever, I decided to get a 3-cup one since I needed a little bit more brew, but none that I bought seem to be functioning well. They start steaming and sputtering right from the beginning, and only fill half of the upper compartment with (burned) coffee. Today I bought my THIRD 3-cup moka pot (different prices, different stores, all aluminum though) and the issue continues.\n\n I had already had to return two of them to the stores, but it's really unlikely that all of the three 3-cup moka pots that I bought are malfunctioning. I spent hours googling all the possible solutions, but nothing helped. I use low heat, I experimented with grind size, screwed the lid on tight, tried cold-hot water, taking the pot apart and cleaning it, but nothing worked. Is there something that I am not doing right?  I assume that it has to do with not enough pressure building up. But they are brand new so it would be very odd if all of them required a gasket or funnel replacement. It's also really strange because I didn't have that issue with my 2-cup and 6-cup. \n\nI enclosed a video of the beginning of the process, there's steam and noise and soon after that it starts sputtering coffee.\n\nThis is driving me crazy because I can't figure out what's going on. I don't think that all those mokas can be defective. I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me with this! Thank you!",

Drawing on my (admittedly limited) knowledge of chemistry, distilled water has no ions and would strip the minerals out of the machine's metal components, causing them to degrade over time. (I didn't mention anything about taste since that's subjective and I didn't want to muddy the water.) But he threw a curveball when he replied that nothing will leach out of stainless steel and that most coffee makers have stainless steel components.\n\nAny chemists on here that can speak to that? Getting mixed results when I search the internet, so I designed my own home experiment with stainless steel spoons. One spoon is in distilled water (measured at 000 PPM) in a plastic bowl and one spoon is in the same type of bowl with filtered water (150 PPM). Identical spoons, identical bowls. If the distilled water degrades the spoon faster than the filtered water, then I'd expect the 000 PPM reading to increase at some point.\n\nI'm also open to being proven wrong. Maybe taste is the only concern...",
