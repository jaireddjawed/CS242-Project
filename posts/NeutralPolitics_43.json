        "text": "I've come across numerous articles stating that Hassan Rouhani called for protesters in the 1999 student's movement to receive the death penalty. Two articles in particular though, offer some additional context that I haven't been able to find anywhere else.\n\nAccording to [this *New York Review of Books* article,](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2013/06/22/rouhani-irans-man-in-middle/)  Rouhani has since explained that he only opposed the 1999 protests, because \"he was in the government at the time and could not have done otherwise.\"\n\nMeanwhile, [this *Al Jazeera* article](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2013/06/2013626104752455273.html#e3) claims that Rouhani denies having called for the 1999 protesters to receive the death penalty.\n\nBoth of these claims are intriguing. But unfortunately, neither of the above articles provide a direct quote from Rouhani, nor do the articles explain where their information came from. Can anyone corroborate these claims through additional sources?\n\nI'm sure that Rouhani is a polarizing figure - and I'm not looking for anyone's general opinion on him. I only want to know whether anyone can provide additional information regarding the specific claims that I've cited from the above two articles.\n\nThanks!",

But in the piece, it seems that he actually makes the counterpoint better than the point he's actually trying to make. [John Oliver on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak&amp;t=4s)\n\nReason.com also posted about Net Neutrality and directly rebutted Oliver's piece.

[ReasonTV Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6txA3pI0xJI)\n\nIt seems to me the core argument against net neutrality is that we don't have a broken system that net neutrality was needed to fix and that all the issues people are afraid of are hypothetical.  John counters that argument saying there are multiple examples in the past where ISPs performed \"fuckery\" (his word).  He then used the T-Mobile payment service where T-Mobile blocked Google Wallet.  Yet, even without Title II or Title I, competition and market forces worked to remove that example.  \n\nAre there better examples where Title II regulation would have protected consumers?",

We have scholars from Brazil, India, Tunisia, Thailand, and Turkey. If you want to sink your teeth into some of their research before asking a question, they recently published a new [report](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/03/17/global-civic- activism-in- flux-pub- 68301) which explores how civic movements are evolving across the world. [Here's a link  to the AUA](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6bh0sj/we_are_experts_and_activists_from_carnegies_civic/) in question.\n\nWhether it be Egypt and the Arab Spring to Ukraine and Maidan Square to Turkey and the Gezi Park protests, civic society and activism has reshaped the larger geopolitics landscape. So drop by and ask a question or just take in the conversation that's going on. Either way, thanks for taking the time to read this! ",
