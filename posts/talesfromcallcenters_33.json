I think she uses the \"$20 to my name\" thing so that people will feel sorry for her and give her money. She signed up for 40 hours a week. There are millions of people who wish that they could work 40 hours a week. If she wants money for nothing, she should just go on welfare.

Our partnership with them only extends to a few products, but I digress. The following conversation took place in literally 2 minutes and 23 seconds:\n\nc=customer\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for calling [Company name] this is [me] how can I help you?\n\n&gt;C: Yeah this is Dr. John Doe, and I just want to know when my next payment is due.\n\n&gt;me: I'd be glad to look that up for you, do you know your policy number?\n\n&gt;C: [gives number]\n\n15 seconds later his contact information is verified\n\n&gt;me: Ok, sir, it looks like you pay monthly so your next payment is due when your policy renews on [date] for [amount]\n\n&gt;C: Thats for 2 months right? The first payment is always for two months?\n\nnote: most customers assume this because the first payment does look like it is double the other months.\n\n&gt;me: Technically no, sir. At renewal you must pay 15% of your premium, and then the following months are 7.7% of the premium. So it may look like two months but it really only covers your first payment.\n\n&gt;C: yeah, thats way too much information for me. Have a good day [click]\n\nI'm left there thinking two things: \n1. Don't bitch about your premium then when you have another payment due that next month. \nAnd 2. You're a doctor for pete's sake. If you can't take in that minuscule amount of information, I'm not sure you made the correct career choice.\n\nI understand that what he should have said was he didn't need to know the breakdown of payments but I was speechless after he hung up on me.\n\nEDIT: Changed an \"is\" to an \"are\"",

I was working for a large UK mobile provider on Live Chat. \nApologies for any format issues- on mobile.\n\nOn live chat if the customer is browsing our site whilst talking to us we can briefly see what pages they're on within our own website.\n\nMe: Welcome blurb\nCx: Hello, I'm having trouble logging in.\n\nThis was a strange one to read as at the time you had to be logged in to get our particular pop up window. I do a quick check...\n\nMe: I can see that you're logged in now\nCx: No see, when I log in it says at the top \"Hi Cx! Not you? Log out.\"\nMe: OK\nCx: So I log out and get the same message, my account must be broken.\nMe: You are Cx so you don't need to hit the log out button.\n\nI did my best to help this customer understand that this wasn't an issue, even got them to navigate to their own bills and confirm that these were showing correctly. They continually insisted that the account was broken and I tried my best to explain that they are who they are and don't need to keep logging out. Customer confirmed understanding and ended the chat.\n\nNow this customer had ended the chat but left the window open with the survey uncompleted so whilst waiting for a response from other customers (this meant the chat stayed in my queue) I checked their window and page history, I could see that after I'd gotten them settled they had once again clicked Log Out and had repeated the same process of logging in, reading the tiny message at the top of their screen and logging out again. They finally stopped 30 minutes later and left me a scathing review because I hadn't fixed the \"broken\" account.",

        "text": "I wrote briefly about this call in another thread, but I think it's worth going into more detail here. \n\nI got a call from a man who sure as hell sounded drunk. I've talked to people with brain damage before and I know one can masquerade as the other, but it wouldn't have changed anything anyway because I am never disrespectful to my customers. \n\n\nAnyway, he was very upset at the amount of his bill. He kept asking me repeatedly why it was so high. I looked into it and he got charged for something, probably usage, and another rep had scheduled a rerate in a few days, having allowed time for the bill to generate. I told him this. He then started going off on why are we sending him text messages, which took a bit of deciphering to figure out... He was pissed because he got a text message with a shutoff notice. Why he couldn't just tell me that it was a shutoff notice, I don't know. Drunk. \n\n\nDuring all of this so far, he was ranting about his bill and repeatedly asking me why it was so high, and I answered him repeatedly with the same info - usage charges that are going to be credited in x number of days since a rerate is scheduled. Now he keeps up with this, but starts throwing in complaints about getting the text message. Repeatedly. \n\n\nI thought I got him calmed down, since the fix for this is so simple - call financial services and they click a button so he doesn't get shut off since there's a dispute/rerate. He didn't want to get put on hold and was belligerent saying \"shut me off then!\" etc. \nThen he goes into inappropriate land, asking me to meet him behind the 7-11 or whatever to \"mess around\" to which I declined. I said I was married. He says \"no wonder you're so bitter.\" lovely! I think he might have called me a bitch too. Whatever.\n\n\n I don't remember exactly what he was saying, but he wasn't hanging up and wasn't letting me put him on hold to call financial. I ended up repeating to him the question \"you have a choice. We can say goodbye and let your account be shut off, or I can put you on hold, call financial, and fix the problem. Which would you prefer?\" I think I said it maybe 5 times before he finally let me put him on hold. Got the problem fixed and after something like 30 to 40 minutes finally ended a call which should have taken 5.\n\n\nTo clarify why I didn't just give up - besides not being allowed to hang up on a customer, we get surveys from our customers. I don't like failing surveys. I did everything I possibly could to help this guy because 1. It's my work ethic and 2. If he did fail me on a survey, under the circumstances, there was a possibility of it being overturned. Also my tolerance for rudeness is extremely high because I just don't care. I was totally calm during this whole conversation. I am really, really good at dealing with angry and difficult people. Somehow the emotional part of my brain figured out that it just doesn't matter. I actually felt a little bad for him - I go home to my husband, my house, my pets - we have a good life, and this dude is drunk and belligerent and quite possibly an alcoholic. I heard kids in the background.   It's sad. ",

My stomach fucks me up each day from that day on from pure stress.\n\nOne day, the toilet on our floor starts to leak a little. This shouldn't be a problem if not for the floor feud... You see, my dear readers, the ladies on floor 1 still hate my guts for leaving them wifi-less for at least 3 weeks. And guess what's on floor 1...\n\nWe put a call in their desk about the leaking toilet... One week passes... Two weeks pass... I walk down and ask and they tell me \n&gt; \"Just have patience, the intern will do it.\" \n\nwith a cutesy pukesy fucking smile. They're most definitely doing it on purpose. \n\nSo I decide to solve the issue myself...\n\nI start eating unhealthy shit for weeks, fucking my system up even more than it already was and primarily use their toilet. I won't say more or give any details, I think it's pretty clear what the result was. Within a couple of DAYS of this... Our floor's toilet was fixed. I went by one morning and said \n&gt; \"Can you say thanks to the intern for fixing the toilet?\" \n\nwith a cutesy pukesy fucking smile... \n\nGive or take a couple of days and I start getting an odd amount of requests from that department. Mouses broken or missing, screens flickering, all that... Very odd shit that was fixed every time I got there, but they did have a little talk with me every time I was there. Asked me if I wanted to have a cup of coffee and stuff, asking me what IT was like, all that.\n\nI think the biohazard I left in their toilet stall those days might've fucked up their brains...\n\nYou'd think that this is the end of the war of the floors, but it's only just beginning...\n\nStay tuned for Part III",

        "text": "Hey guys! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here.\n\nI wanted to share something that happened today that made my job (member service in a credit union call center) feel worth it.\n\nSo, I got a call today from a member who initially just asked me to \"check on her account\". Normally when I get these calls, it's either due to the member wanting to see if X transaction/check cleared, if Y deposit came in, or to just check a balance. Sometimes, it involves a possible overdraft or unauthorized activity.\n\nI verify her, pull up the account, and take a look. I notice that her checking was overdrawn by ~$100.00. I don't mention it, instead saying, \"Thanks for answering all of my questions, now what can I help you with on your account?\"\n\n\"I was wanting to see if [student loan provider]'s payment was taken out.\"\n\nPull up the checking and, sure enough, SLP was the overdraw. However, we do have overdraft protection by default at my credit union (up to a small, reasonable amount), at the cost of a ~$30.00 fee. \n\n\"Ah, yes. I do see that [SLP] went through on [Y date] for [X].\"\n\n\"Oh... okay.\" She pauses before asking, \"Is it going to try again? I know we're short, my husband doesn't get paid until Friday...\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it was paid,\" I explain. \"We have overdraft protection up to [X amount], so it didn't reject. It won't keep trying to draft the account or anything, we covered it.\"\n\nShe doesn't reply for a moment, before I add, \"Let me check something on this account really quick...\"\n\nNow, I should state that I have some leeway with my credit union's policy on fees. Anything due to fraud/theft/credit union error is always waived. Most things can be waived as a one-time courtesy. Sometimes things can be waived beyond that if it's right for the member. Some reps are more strict with this than I am. I gauge it by a variety of factors, but the first thing I look for is account history.\n\nI go through her account, seeing that she has never previously overdrawn the checking. I also note that the joint account has gone from two direct deposits to one in recent months.\n\n\"Okay,\" I say after a few moments, breaking the short silence, \"I'll go ahead and reverse the fee for you as a one-time courtesy. It looks like you haven't overdrawn this account before, and we haven't had any other fees assessed, so I'm willing to take care of this for you today. It'll take a few minutes, so if you're looking online, you'll need to log out and back in after five or ten...\"\n\nI say this above spiel almost verbatim during nearly every fee refund. Almost always, I get a simple, \"Thank you,\" and that ends the call, unless there's something else (usually small) the member needs.\n\nWhat I don't usually get... is a choked-up voice, tears running through its words, saying, \"Thank you, thank you so much.\"\n\n*Fuck.* \"You're welcome. I hope you have a good day. Have a good holiday, too.\"\n\n\"Y-you too...\"\n\nI took a little break after that.\n\nToday was Monday, but I hated it a little less than usual.",

But here's the kicker: I worked for a call center and didn't know until I was let go that we had some temp workers from Randstad and thought it was silly due to the turnover and the job fairs we held.

        "text": "Oh boy, do I have a fuck ton of stories about my internship where I'm currently still running...\n\nThis is Part one of a series of horrible experiences I've had during work here. I still have a month and a half to go, so much of this is still ongoing.\n\nThis'll mostly be about my colleague, whom we will call...\n\nJoe Donothing. That's a nice name for him, yeah. He's sitting two desks away from me as I write this, so I'd like to keep this discrete. So starting my days, things went pretty alright until Joe Donothing came into my life. By god did he do fuck all all day... \n\nMy days with him started putting up aeronets/access points. The idea was that with two ladders and two drills, we could both work to get shit done. Drill a hole in one place, drill a hole in the other where the wire would go. Easy, right? All we had to do with drill two holes, lift the ceiling tiles, toss it from one hole to the other. I make my rounds, 'cause Joe came in on Monday and Thursday, only from 10 AM 'til 12:30 PM. He would take care of it.\n\nNow for those of you who don't know, Aeronets are wifi hotspots. These are essential for your company if you have a big building. The wifi would be down in some parts and bad in others for the few days that the IT place would take care of them.\n\nJoe came in for two weeks, did nothing, then walked around the building, then left. This went on for some time. Me and my bosses thought that he was doing his job. Some days later, I get a pissed off call...\n\n\"God damnit, you fucking IT assholes promised us it would only be a couple of days and this jackass comes by and tells us to sit tight and wait for at least three weeks now!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, miss, calm down. I'm not sure what you mean.\"\n\n\"He told me the intern would take care of everything and STILL nothing's happened!\"\n\nSome shouting later I've sorted it out. I end up going around the whole place and on the day that we sit around the table to discuss this weeks trouble, my boss turns to me and asks me to explain why I didn't do as I promised right away. Yes, Joe had blamed it all on me... And they believed him 'cause he was a worker and I was an intern. Almost lost my job that day.\n\nTo date, I still get nasty looks from the second floor ladies and they STILL call me all kinds of shit behind my back.\n\nEvery time I get calls from them, I can feel the tension and anger in their voice. I still do NOT understand why, as it honestly wasn't that big of a deal, let alone that it was my fault.\n\nAnd that's just part one. Very little to do with my work on the callcenter duty, but trust me, this'll come into play more at part II: Revenge of the Bitch.",

        "text": "Some backstory if anyone is interested.\n\nAlright so I worked quite a few shifts at my last job as a rep. I worked 8-5pm, 4-1pm. Even in the end when I put in my notice and felt pressured into working part time I worked 5-10pm. Truly enjoyed working the early shift... no calls came in for 4 hours so it was rather smooth, but boring. Of course this has nothing to do with my favorite shift.... I have a story for staying late during my 8-5 shift. \n\nNow the company I work for has if they are lucky 10 reps at a time, and about 4 support staffs. Now that is only during the big 8-5 hours during weekdays. Weekends and early/overnight shifts had maybe two people at a time. I put in a notice to my supervisor stating that I need to leave early one day for my dentist appointment. She decides to give me the whole day off for whatever reason, so I email my manager to see if I can still get in 40 hours. She lets me work 8-7pm for that week. \n\nStory time.\n\n2 maybe 3 reps on the phone and one support. A customer calls in stating his system is beeping. I pull up the account and hear the beeping myself. Of course the beeping I hear is not the one from his system, so I ask if he has any inhouse smokes. He has one, but is adamant that it's his system. Tell him to power it down. This is when it gets kind of frustrating for me, and him. He can't open the box for whatever reason. I myself know that the boxes do sometimes require a bit of force to be opened. Something similar to a super tight cap on a litre of soda. Not a lot of pressure is required at all. \n\nSo I go ahead and tell him to apply some pressure. Obviously what happened next was not going through my mind. I don't know if doesn't understand the concept of some pressure, or when to stop but he rips the box off the wall. Complaining now that it didn't stop the beeping and his hand is bleeding and he is on blood thinners (Honestly that info was not needed, but whatever). I call my support and she tells me to advise him charges may apply as the troubleshooting on our side shows that it's not his system (we can see troubles on the system, and there would be a lot of errors popping up if he removed the main box off the wall). I tell him and he gets ecstatic. Call support again and she tells me to just schedule him and to call back to have it approved (was still in my training period, to be honest I never really got them approved as I knew what I was doing, and was also approving other peoples schedules... idk how that works but w/e). Scheduled for Tuesday since he called on Friday. He wants to speak to a supervisor, so I transfer.\n\nIn the end nothing was wrong with the system, nor his hand so we charged him the service fee.  \n\nTL;DR Customer ripped the box when asked to apply some pressure\n\nWish I didn't have to hold the customer's hand in the most simple of concepts.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5e1hp4/how_i_left_my_crappy_call_center_jobs_behind/",
        "text": "From ages 21-25, I worked in various call centers in tech support. I'm 28 now and have lived the last 3 years without fear of metrics, SLA's, or fucking mandatory overtime. I love my current job and am planning to accept an offer in a couple weeks for something even better. I don't have a college degree and I have zero certifications. But I am approaching 6 figures and will reach that goal by age 30, if this momentum continues. I felt inspired to offer up some unsolicited advice in hopes that anyone who reads this will be helped in some way. :)\n\n1. Update your resume with every single worthwhile skill gained at the call center. You've got to update your resume and document your skills in order to leverage any career skills you've gained at the call center. \n\n2. Refresh your contact information on Monster and other career sites. Doing this refreshes your profile to the top of the search queues for recruiters. Even if you're just going into your contact information and deleting the phone number and adding the same one right back, your activity on the website increases chances for recruitment calls.\n\n3. Get competitive about your call stats. You really have to think of your co-workers as your competition. I'm not suggesting you start drama or be a jerk to anyone. I'm saying that the people running your call center are counting on you making friends and getting cozy. It saves them money on training your replacement (seriously). Don't get complacent. Focus less on happy hour and more on getting your stats higher. If you don't immediately get yourself into a better gig, you might at least land an easier role within the call center. For me, better stats got me on the chat/email support team so I could listen to podcasts/music all day. It also increased my ability to dig through career sites to apply for more jobs. \n\n4. Don't burn any bridges. Other people are trying to leave your call center too. They might be helpful contacts so try not to indulge in petty revenge or bragging as you make your exit. Nothing feels better than putting in your two week notice when you have a better gig lined up. But being a jerk about it could alienate you from people that you may end up working with again some day. Resist the urge!\n\n5. Keep yourself healthy. If you've gained weight at the call center, get in the gym or out in the sun as much as possible. It's better for your mental sanity and your appearance during interviews. Even something as simple as dropping a few pounds can show management that you're able to set goals and take steps toward accomplishing them. This again can increase your chances of landing a cushier role within your current organization.\n\n6. Learn something during your off hours. Certifications are great but you don't have to spend a ton of money to get skills or proof of your abilities. For example, I started messing around with PowerShell and SQL programming in my spare time. I built a few helpful scripts for my tech support gig and put them on Github.com (website for managing/sharing revisions of your code). I added my git hub page address to my resume and used the amount of forks/views as proof of my ability to learn code. \n\n7. Aim high. Be realistic but don't sell yourself short for the simple purpose of leaving the call center. Given enough time, the right door will open and you won't have to make a lateral move or even worse; take a pay-cut. Eventually you will get a 'Yes' and your paycheck should always increase, never decrease.\n\n8. Request recommendation letters from clients/customers. If you're bold enough, find a way to solicit good feedback from your user base. If you can get recommendation letters, save them and consider ways to include them with your resume for in-person interviews. \n\n9. Be discrete. Sometimes it's just best for management and co-workers to not know you're planning to leave. Worst case scenario is your boss finding out and  you being escorted out of the building. Don't let that scare you though, just be  sensible and don't browse LinkedIn when supervisors are nearby. \n\n10. Find out what actually interests you. For lots of tech support or customer service centers, the quickest way to become a 'lifer' is to never figure out what you really want to do with your career. Falling into a job as a manager or team lead at a call center can be a good career for some folks. But if you're not sure what path to take and definitely want to avoid call centers, it might be a good idea to check out a career fair or take some fun classes at a community college. It's very hard to chase something if you don't know what you're after. Be focused and intentional so that the reward for your efforts is something you can actually enjoy. ",

There are like 15 agents in my station only and god knows how many in the other stations in Canada....

A price plan at a really low price but a lot of GBs. Then another company and my company decided to jump on the band wagon and lower as well. The only difference (at least for us) is that the customer has to say one of the two companies to be eligible. -_- It blew up! Apparently we hit radio stations and news networks so there were too many people who heard about it compared to actual workers for the chat department. \n\nUpdate: 1:05 AM and 880 customers left. It's mostly disconnects but we still have to wait for 30 secs before we can close the chat -_-. I had one customer and they wanted to confirm their plan.... and waited over 5hours to know this.... WHY! XD\n\n2nd Update: 2:40AM and WE ARE FREE!!! Sort of.... I'm on my last chat but our security system for the building kicked in so we are stuck inside, lol. While I finish this one up I have to wait 20mins for our secuiryt guy to come save us.",

        "text": "This story is from a bit over 10 years ago. Just as the bottom was dropping out of the specific call center industry in which I was employed at the time. I was actually fairly new to the game by comparison to many of those around me.\n\nI was hired by one of two partners that were in the middle of going separate ways, but weren't as open about it as they wanted to be.\n\nThe partner that hired me really wanted to keep his call center Straight and Long Term. Build it up, make happy clients. He found ways to get paid on virtually every leg of the deal. Not a lot on all legs, but no holes so he'd have great cash flow and never have to worry about a bottleneck one day choking his revenue stream.\n\nHis partner, on the other hand, just wanted to make as much cash as possible as soon as possible since having a lot of cash solves *all* problems, right? Plus, he had no problem at all with lying to make a sale.\n\nSo we had a fairly small call center set up and running stable. The partner decides that this is a great model and he wants to improve upon it to seriously increase the cash flow. Since it was working, my boss approved the expansion, expecting we'd hire some more operators and expand slowly using our already proven technique and scripts.\n\nBut no: The other partner just cuts a deal with another call center. Of course, there was a reason this other call center was available to cut said deal. Crooks. LOL\n\nWithin a couple days, we have three times the seats running. Sales are through the roof. Other partner is beside himself with glee since we're not spending much extra (no new overhead, just sales reps). But he did his best to keep me out of the room, and kept my boss in the executive area. Then I got behind one of the new sales reps and heard the pitch. Lies, crazy stuff. Faked verifications. Of course I reported this, making the other partner a sworn enemy. Now the two partners are battling. The client to whom they are selling is very happy, cuz *sales*.\n\nThen it began. Chargebacks.\n\nMy boss took me aside during a free moment and asked my opinion. He knew I was fairly new to the business, but not that new. And I could still see interactions that management couldn't (because I could be in the room and still be ignored, since I was also a technician and blended in nicely).\n\nI told him that the Client would be getting these chargebacks from our room, more so than other places. The \"coolness\" of the sales would then wear off. And that he would likely be called in for a meeting at the client location very soon. And from that meeting, he'd be told that the credit card machine (we had to hand key all charges back then) would be getting recalled. They would likely want to send someone over to get it, or drive him over personally to pick it up. Of course, they wouldn't say \"and bring it with you\", because then we would have control of the device *after* knowing we were losing it.\n\nHe wasn't sure what I meant ... so I clarified my \"two point strategy\" to maintain independence.\n\n1) Get a new merchant account of your own Right Freakin' Now and hope it's Live before the client kills this deal.\n\n2) When you get that call *and you will* be sure you notify *me* that you have a meeting, and where. If you don't text \"false alarm\" within 10 minutes of the meeting starting, I'll have the bookkeeper process refunds for *everyone* in the queue.\n\nHe said \"but we'll go negative ... they said never to do that\".\n\nI said \"right, never do that ... or we'll cancel this contract.\" Which, of course, is what they are going to do. The goal is to get out of it owing the general public as little as possible. After all, they are undoubtedly going to hold your payment, even if you're owed a huge amount, and then discuss you becoming an employee (again) instead of an independent contractor. And if they have all your money *and* you owe a bunch of refunds you can't pay, how could you possibly refuse?\n\nSo he applied for two merchant accounts, and two licenses, and opened two corporations. The first merchant account went live in just a few days (not a great deal, but functional, and the second one that went live a week later was much better).\n\nAnd then I got that call. LOL. I told the bookkeeper to process every refund she could get her hands on. Even ones that hadn't been fully finished paperwork-wise. Just process all of them Right Freakin' Now. If you see the boss walk in the door with some suits, Batch Out!! and then walk away and smile at the boss.\n\nShe got a bit lazy, and stopped about $10k short of finish. And it seriously pissed off the client. But they have deep pockets and had made so much money from the sales in the first place that it was mostly the fact that they got played, and lost their hand against the boss that pissed them off. They really wanted him \"in-house\".\n\nThen the partner who still hated me had no choice but to take the deal, though. Since he was the one who promised to pay 2/3 of the work force (all the new ones) and had Zero money. The boss, on the other hand, merely had to give back the company car and walk away. We were selling on the new merchant account the same day they came for the CC machine, and the flow had resumed.\n\nAnd he never let anyone mess with the scripts, or take chances with chargebacks after that (no lies!).\n\nUnfortunately, the bottom dropped out of the market a couple years later and he lost the whole thing.\n\nIt's cool when Suits are predictable, though.",

The client wasn't particularly loud or aggressive, however he was pretty angry/frustrated over a claim we didn't pay and asked for more information on. I politely explained to him that since we are his second plan, we need a statement from his first one to coordinate the payments, and suggested that if he indeed had maxed out his benefits under the other plan, he have them send a letter confirming it, which we could then add on his file and solve the problem once and for all. He eventually agreed, thanked me and hung up.   \n\nFast forward a couple of hours, I get an e-mail from a CCR titled \"[client name] apology\". It turns out the client called his other insurer and found out that he hadn't actually maxed out his benefits so he would just re-submit his claim to them, and he then called back wanting to apologize for being angry earlier and to admit that he (the CCR quoted him) \"ate a slice of humble pie\".   \n\nI printed out that e-mail and hung it at my desk, as a reminder that not all angry customers are assholes 100% of the time and there might just be some hope.

We were working in a call center of what is normally a costume warehouse but did other holiday campaigns on the side. We were working a Valentine's day campaign selling Flowers for [online flower retailer]. Mostly it was taking orders leading up to Valentines day, and then promptly refunding all of those customers after the holiday when they said they got the flowers and they sucked.\n\nAnyway during lunch one day my co-worker was telling us that she was speaking with a guy who was placing 2 orders for flowers: 1 for his wife, and the other for you guessed it... his mistress. Now customers had the option of including a message with their flowers. We could only place the order, we did not process the handling of flowers or typing of messages. This genius decided he wanted messages for both wifey and mistress. This (paraphrased) conversation follows:\n\n   &gt; CSR: Ok so that is going to be reviews order with messages\n\n   &gt; Customer: Yeah. Please don't get those mixed up. I don't want to sort out that mess. It wouldn't be good\n\n   &gt; CSR: We will try our hardest, sir, but we don't actually process your order here, we just send your order out to our retailers.\n\n  &gt; Customer: nervous sigh ok, go ahead and submit it\n\n  &gt; CSR: Have a nice day sir.\n\nWe all laughed when she told us. Like come on, dude. Either don't cheat on your wife or if that's too hard for you, don't order flowers from the same place and hope that the orders aren't mixed up.\n\nEDIT: Formatting\n",

        "text": "This happened to me about 2 years ago, not long after I started working for my employer.\n\nI work for an insurance provider that deals both with agencies but also with customers directly. At the time I was a customer service representative selling insurance and managing policies. Working in a call center environment can be stressful enough as it is but when you have to deal with a customer like the one I'm about to tell of, it makes you want to rip your hair out.\n\nAnyway, we tend to not be that busy between September and March. Steady business but not slammed like we are in the summer months. Sometime in October is when the following interaction takes place. Keep in mind this lady had 2 policies with us, one in Hawaii and one in Oregon. According to her she spent 6 months in Hawaii in the Winter and 6 months in Oregon for the spring/summer.\n\nSide note: it is not uncommon for us to have customers with policies in more than one state, especially if they have vacation homes.\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for calling Company Name This is me how can I help you?\n\n&gt;C: I DIDN'T GET MY POLICY\n\n&gt;me: I'm sorry?\n\n&gt;C: I DIDN'T GET MY POLICY. SEND ME MY POLICY.\n\n&gt;me: Ok, do you have your policy number?\n\n&gt;C: NO, I never have it on me, you people ask me this every time I call.\n\nAs if this is an unreasonable request.\n\n&gt;me: ...Ok, well what's your name, I can just look you up that way\n\n&gt;C: It's *name* -- big sigh\n\n&gt;me: Ok, I've found you. Which policy were you calling in about?\n\n&gt;C: another big sigh THE HAWAII ONE!\n\n&gt;me: Ok. Could you please verify your name and phone number for security purposes?\n\n&gt;C: YOU PEOPLE ASK THIS EVERY TIME, I'M IN A HURRY\n\n&gt;me: well, again this is for your security\n\n&gt;C: I DON'T CARE JUST SEND ME MY POLICY\n\nNow even though she had 2 different policies, she had both policies set up to receive mail at her Oregon address. My supervisor at the time advised me that it was ok to send her the policy as she was being super difficult.\n\n&gt;me: Ok, so I should be sending it to this address? lists address on file\n\n&gt;C: NO!! WHY WOULD YOU SEND IT THERE? THIS UNIT IS CLEARLY KEPT IN HAWAII, NOT OREGON\n\n&gt;me: well, ma'am the last time you called you set both policies to mail to Oregon. Would you like me to update the policy for you?\n\n&gt;C: oh jesus. NO! JUST MAIL IT TO *address*\n\n&gt;me: Ok ma'am. I'll send it out. You should receive it in about 3-5 business days.\n\n&gt;C: yeah thats what you people always say and then it's never here on time. Whatever, bye.\n\nphone disconnects.\n\n&gt;me: gives a big finger to the phone well have a nice day to you too, psycho.\n\nAfter that I'm pretty sure I went to my supervisor and asked if she had anything I could spike my coffee with to get through the rest of the day. She just laughed and said no. I went back to my desk. Life went on.\n\nThat lady ended up calling in a couple more times to different reps, all pretty much with the same outcomes.\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

The one in my city is pretty famous for being...hard to get fired from I guess.  I racked up 16 absences and 2 no-call no shows in three months.  So they reset the entire policy on not showing up for me to not fire me.  We had a guy who came in, clocked in, went to sleep, went home.  For months.  He was merely reprimanded.\n\nI got to see some interesting things.  One person chucked a chair at security once.  Fun times.  I did CSR work for prepaid cell phones.  The cubicles across from me were TSR for a cable company.  \n\nSo one day, a guy over there puts his phone into after-call.  They had to do this a lot since they would reset the EMT and have to call you back on your cell.  But he doesn't call the customer back.  He calls a sex hotline.\n\nApparently he'd been talking to them for about an hour before the person beside him began paying attention to what he was saying.  She looked over to find him.....helping himself through the day with a single-handed determination and began screaming.\n\nSecurity got called, cops got called, he just kept going until they finally hauled him away.  \n\nSo if people ever wonder if call centers really are that stressful, yes they are.",

One year of NOT having to take phone calls? No brainer, so of course I jumped at the chance. They put the 2 of us in what was essentially an office the size of a closet and there were only 3 or so other people on the entire floor. Quickly, we realized that people had even forgotten we were down there. For the special project we were reporting to a sup in another state and the freedom was so great. \n\n\nThen one day we were working away in our little closet office and the door came flying open. There were 2 firemen in full gear. One of the firemen yelled, “Why did you not evacuate?!?” Coworker and I looked at each other like WTF? Turns out, the fire alarm had gone off on the call center floor due to an actual (small) fire in the kitchen. The fire alarms on every other floor in the building went off except the floor we were on. The call center supervisor had come down to our floor and told the few other employees to evacuate, but they had completely forgotten to tell us. That was definitely an Office Space moment for me. ",

        "text": "My very first full time job ever was taking calls for cell phone support for a major provider here in the US. Being intelligent, competent and unfortunate enough to actually give a shit about my job, I got moved around to a few different departments before settling in overnight Tech Support, which looking back was a dream. The pay was alright, the calls were extremely easy (majority of them being credit denials) and being overnight we got access to the floor wifi. All in all, pretty sweet.\n\nIf there was one downside, it was the fact that the upper management at our center didn't really give a shit about their overnight employees. We were usually the last to find out about important info, like when overtime would be mandatory or when major changes would come through our systems that would keep us down and unable to process calls for hours on end.\n\nWhile overnight I had a co-worker that we'll call A for our story. \"A\" was an older lady, not always the most technically inclined but always had an easy time connecting with customers and making the tech support process easier for them. Being older she had several health issues, not that that ever stopped her from coming in when she was needed.\n\nSo one night, I walk through my regular entrance, nod to the security guard on post, badge the door and walk in. Immediately I'm hit by two things: the complete lack of other people on the floor (even late at night there were usually a few teams around other than the overnight crew) and an extremely heavy chemical smell.\n\nA few seconds after walking in, I run into another team mate who had stopped in to grab something from his desk. Turns out, the floor was being fumigated for bed bugs that night, and we were taking calls on another floor. \n\nI was stunned, since the door to our production floor didn't even have a sign up warning anyone what was going on. Talking to others later, it turned out not even the overnight supervisors were warned of when this was gonna happen, just that there would be a fumigation \"soon\" and no followup on it. \n\nThe fumigation had caused some problems for some, namely with A. A had weak lungs, and when she walked onto the floor her lungs almost immediately started seizing up. Amazingly, she managed to stay on the phones for 4 hours (whether out of dedication or spite, I'll never be sure) before having to leave due to her reaction. (and one of the sups still had the gall to tell her that she might get written up for leaving early unapproved.)\n\nNaturally both A and our immediate supervisor are pissed due to the situation, and email the operation managers of the site explaining what happened to A and asking why there had been no warning to the fumigation start day. From my understanding, their response was essentially \"Oops\" and they proceeded to not respond to further emails, like they didn't want to admit they had fucked up royally and were waiting for it to blow over.\n\nIt took several calls to our HR department and A almost having to threaten a lawsuit for the operation managers to have a meeting with her, where they finally ate crow and apologized for the incident. Why A decided to continue working there for another year was a mystery to me.\n\nNeedless to say that when our call center was eventually shut down due to the many other issues it had had over the two years I was there, I didn't quite shed a tear when the news came down. More like elation, really.",

        "text": "Nearly five years ago I started working at a baby Bell-level DSL ISP in the residential internet repair. In college, I briefly worked in call center in a different company's telephone billing department. I lasted three months and swore off call centers for life.\n\nI started as a tier 1 contractor with no benefits. The only reason I even started was because I put in my application via a career site, received a call, interview and job offer all in less than 48hrs. My first day of training coincidentally was my birthday. There were 14 people in the training class.\n\nThree weeks of training on all of the different systems, and it was time to throw us on the phones. We were given identical starting schedules and our desks clustered together and for the first two weeks, we had a coach/trainer alongside ready to help us. Those first three months were grueling with lots of mandatory overtime. I had daytime schedules, finishing up at about 4pm. The calls were back to back from about 8am through 2pm. Days were long.\n\nFour months later, I was hired on full time. My pay went up over 10%, I got benefits and more than 15 days PTO per year. As long as you hit your metrics, you had a lot of leeway in how you solved the customer's problems. Other than the opening and closing lines, there were no scripts. There were some very good troubleshooting guides on the intranet wiki and I took pride in knowing them very well.\n\nNot long after getting hired on (~5th month), I was moved to chat support, getting me off the phones. Other than a meh schedule, it was a dream. I could assume people's internet was working -- no crawling behind desks rebooting modems -- and it was slow; generally 20+ minutes between calls. I wrote lots of phrases I could copy and paste for common issues like password resets. I was happy.\n\nBy the holidays (~8th month), management told me I was being put back on the phones. BUT I would also be moved to \"tier 2\" with a pay increase (a whole 23c/hr). The tier 2 training was great and we possibly had the greatest techs assembled at the time. Spoiler: all of them who stuck around made it to tier 4/coach. We got access to the elements (aggregators, dslams) and could use additional tools to troubleshoot. Plus, as long as tier 1 didn't have a queue, we only got tier 2 transfers from them.\n\nAt this time I was also moved to another manager, possibly the best manager I've ever had. He'd been with the company for over a decade and started on the phones himself. He knew we dealt with more difficult issues and we were good techs. If we needed additional time between calls to properly document what we did, he allowed it without question, trusting our judgement. His team generally had some of the best metrics in the entire department. Especially the critical \"net promoter scores\". Heck, I won an award that first year for the number of perfect scores I recieved.\n\nI was in tier 2 for about a year before being offered a position in tier 3. Their job was to act as fill-in coaches as well as work on the more complex connections we sold. Like that one random apartment complex that uses nonstandard equipment, tier 3's job was to support that. From my original training class 4 people remained. Two of them were in the same tier 3 class as me, the other two were in the next one.\n\nTier 3 was pretty good at first. Most calls were from other agents to the \"questions\" line, with only the occasional customer call. Then we were trained on the television product. Officially this was so we could answer questions and act as \"superivsors\" for the television repair t1's.\n\nThe documentation for the television product was terrible. After about 6 months in tier 3, my supervisor asked me to help another supervisor replace the documentation and bring it under repair's control so it could be updated. At first, I was off the phones 50% of the time, and before long 100% offline to build out the new help site.\n\nWhen the new help site rolled out, it immediately decreased handle times for the tier 1 agents by 10%, allowing them an ENTIRE EXTRA CALL PER DAY. This, I'm sure made a lot of people very happy. All I saw of it was a 5% pay increase after my performance review. While in tier 3, I was trained as a fill-in tier 4. Mostly so I would stop calling them.\n\nThis new help/documentation intranet site which I ended up leading the development of was a HUGE success. By design, we could update it with new processes or for new equipment quickly. Generally an update took a week to go into production, including a full review. Emergency fixes could be done within minutes, plus version tracking so we could roll back if needed. The old site took nearly a month for every minor update. At some point I was officially promoted to \"tier 4\".\n\nThe intranet site grew in scope and back-end logic was added (mostly by me, or the team of informal developers I was now leading) ensuring agents only got the information applicable to their call -- further shortening handle times. All of my time was off the phones, some in meetings. My manager, the tier 1 managers, and even their manager was very happy with the work I was doing.\n\nThen, a bean counter somewhere up the management chain saw there were \"highly\" paid techs not taking phone calls. People like me. People like those who research and post outages quickly. And they passed down a decree that we get on the phones at least 25% of the time. I grudgingly accepted. All of the calls I took were supervisor escalations. Nearly evenly split between \"my tech didn't show up\" and \"offshore tech sucks\". At least I had a daytime schedule, my manager made sure his team worked m-f daytimes so we could be working when he was.\n\nNot even 3 months later, the 25% phones became 50%, and didn't include breaks. In reality it was 60% of the day, leaving just three hours to keep the intranet site and other projects updated. Now I don't know if you've written software, but if its complex enough it easily takes 2-3 hours of review just to catch up to where you were the day before. Projects that used to take 1-2 days were now taking weeks.\n\nThe final straw: being put into the tier 1 television troubleshooting queue. AND the queue being given higher priority to my ear than the questions from agents or even superivsor escalations. Television customers were the only ones who would get angrier when you fixed their issue. I would've accepted taking the tv tier 1 calls if we only took tv overflow calls when they were in queue, but no. Regular in queue as if tier 1. Management decided my time was literally more worth helping people program their tv remote than making sure the tier 1 agents had documentation on the new tv remote we were sending to customer.\n\nI lasted only a couple more months. Almost exactly 4 years from when I started as a contractor, I gave my manager my two weeks notice. I had 6 months of savings in my account and was ready to do something without a headset. I also didn't take another call after giving my notice. I spent that time documenting all of the code I had written so that it could continue to be maintained. I liked my manager and my coworkers. I keep in touch with many of them to this day.\n\nOn my last day, I sent [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjWe31S_0g) to a few select friends. (NSFW-language)\n\nI start my new job Monday. Its full time, salaried, with a 35% pay increase. Plus a flexible schedule with weekends and paid holidays off. Edit: and no headset unless I want to listen to music. ",

        "text": "I work for a large insurance company in the customer service department. We are open 24/7 to assist customers outside of business hours or to handle simple billing questions or things of that nature. I'm not licensed, so I can't really handle state-specific questions or give any legal advise or information. \nSo this woman called in on Friday around 8:00 PM, clearly after business hours, and yelled at me for like 20 minutes, bitching about things that I cannot do anything about. Every time I tried to intervene, she'd start talking over me, so I just sat there in silence and waiting for her to finish her tantrum. As soon as there was a moment of silence, I said, \"Ma'am, I understand your concerns. However, this is not something I am able to assist you with. Your agent is the best resource for these concerns. I will send him a detailed message regarding your questions and have him call you on Monday.\" I was annoyed, but I was still being friendly because my calls are actually monitored and they grade them very strictly. This woman was livid and started screaming, \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?\" \nMe: No, ma'am. I am not kidding. \nHer: What's the point of your job? If you can't do anything, why do you even work here? Do you even know what you're doing? They shouldn't have ever hired a stupid bitch like you because you can't do anything right. Fuck you! \nMe: I'm sorry you disagree with my employment status at (insurance company), but you'll still need to speak to your agent on Monday. I'll have him call you then. Is the phone number on your account, 123-456-7890, the best number to reach you? \nHer: What's your last name? \nMe: I cannot provide you with that information. \nHer: Let me speak to your manager. \n\nSo I called my supervisor, told her the whole situation and what the woman originally needed. She responded, \"Oh, so you were just doing your job? Nice. Put her on the line.\" The woman ended up filing a formal complaint, so on my file at work, they have captured the quote, \"I'm sorry you disagree with my employment status,\" to document my \"offensive language.\" My supervisor brought me a donut and coffee before leaving for the day.

I used to work at one of the call centers for a store where you can buy things in bulk and you need a membership to shop there. \n\nI worked in the online returns department but that day someone didn't understand the number tree and decided to file a complaint about the store with me instead of someone in the appropriate department. \n\nI will be Me and the caller will be MB = Mr. Bigot:\n\nMe: Thank you for shopping at our store, how can I help you?\n\nMB: I have a complaint about the specific store I shop in. \n\n*Not my department. Not my problem. Waste of my time. This guy is already dead to me.*\n\nMe: This is the department that deals with online returns. I can transfer you to someone who can better assist you if you like...\n\nMB: No, just send an email to your boss for me. You can do that right?\n\nMe: Yes, I can. *Opens up a program I haven't had to use since training.* Ok, what seems to be the issue?\n\nMB: Every time I come into this store there are too many Mexicans! \n\nMe: O_O^wuuuut \n\nMB: Hello?\n\nMe: *Ahem*, I'm still here. Too... many...Mexicans... \n\nMB: Yes ma'am, they're always a bunch of them here every time I come into the store and I'd like to complain!\n\n*At this point I'm supposed to finish out the email, get a callback number or something, send it out and take the next call. But quality only listened to 1 out of 4 calls, and I liked them odds. I don't remember if I was in a bad mood or what but this is what happened next:*\n\nMe: Alright sir, just for my own curiosity, how would you like the store to assist with this problem?\n\nMB: Stop letting so many of them in here!\n\nMe: But if they're there that means they have memberships, which they have to apply and be approved to have. \n\nMB: Do they have to give them to so many Mexicans??\n\nMe: Yes sir, they do. It would be against the law if they didn't. \n\nMB: Well I don't think that's right. Is there a time I can come in and not have to deal with all of them?\n\nMe: Early in the morning or late at night? That's when most stores are usually empty. Have you spoken with the manager of your store? They might be able to tell you the best time to come in, to avoid the Mexicans, of course (trying so damn hard not to crack up. I deserve an Oscar). \n\nMB: Is this not the store? \n\nMe: No sir, this is the online returns department. I issue refunds and return labels for when someone buys something online and decides they don't want it. \n\nMB: Oh. Can they not return it at the store? \n\nMe: They can, it's just sometimes furniture or things they can't fit in their car.\n\nMB: Oh, that's good to know. Well, I'm here at the store right now, I can just find the manager myself. Do you know his name? \n\nMe: (Praying to all of the gods that he's Mexican) No sir, I just have the phone number and address. \n\nMB: Well, nevermind about that email then. I'll find him and talk to him myself. Thank you for all of your help.\n\nMe: Glad to be of service. Thank you for shopping at our store and have a great day. \n\nAnd that's how a call like that ended up with a halfway decent resolution. Quality didn't hear it, and I never heard anything about it ever again. The end.",

        "text": "I'm a senior rep in my call center, meaning that despite not technically being a supervisor, I get to take escalated calls where people demand to speak with a manager (yes, even when there are three supervisors and a manager above me).\n\nI got such a call sent to me today. I work at a medical device company (we make equipment, not drugs), and one of our distributors placed an order last week, and their order still hadn't arrived. The customer was screaming for a supervisor.\n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, medical devices are incredibly expensive, and this was a distributor so it was a large order, over $30,000. We have a rule in place that says if an order is placed over the phone for more than $25,000, we must put the order on hold, and ask the customer to send us a hard copy PO via email, and hand it off to our accounts receivable department for approval. It acts as one part fraud protection (we can compare it to other POs we have from them and prove it is them placing the large order), and one part contract. The contract part is where this situation gets sticky.\n\nThe CSR requested a PO from the customer, and received it. However, when they sent it over to AR, they were told that we needed a revised PO. The payment terms listed on the customer's PO wasn't correct (they put \"none\" where it should have been Net 30), and since we treat a PO as a contract, we couldn't accept it as it didn't match exactly what we had. The CSR contacted the customer by email on Thursday last week, and then never heard back.\n\nToday, she attempted to contact the customer again so that she could release the hold. Customer immediately starts screaming and requesting a supervisor. That's where I come in.\n\nI introduce myself, and she just goes *off* on me. \"These are medical devices, not toys or candy! We can't not have stock! Why is my order on hold? I demand you release the hold and let the stock shop on Monday!\" I could barely get a word in edgewise. I try to explain the situation to her, and she refuses to let me speak. I took the headset off and let her rant for a while before trying to speak. \n\nWhile she was ranting, the CSR was showing me exactly what she'd done. You know what I love and hate about email? Timestamps. It can save your ass, or it can bury you when you made a mistake. I explained to the customer that our AR department was requiring a revised PO, and that there was nothing we could do in customer service. \n\nMe: \"[CSR] sent you an email on November 3rd outlining what we need, and including the contact info for the AR person who handles your account. You can contact them to have the hold released.\"\n\nCustomer: \"I never got that email!\"\n\nMe: \"OK, in that case I'm going to have [CSR] send it to you again. Maybe we spelled your email wrong, let me check. Is it [email]?\"\n\nCustomer: \"Oh, here it is. So I just need to send it to [AR]?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, they'll take care of you.\"\n\nShe hung up, and contacted AR. 10 minutes later, I got an IM from a different CSR. *She'd called back to place another order*. Another order over $25,000. I hope she remembered to send over the PO with the correct terms listed on it.",

You don't know what you're talking about. You're stupid; I can tell.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: *[a beat of silence]*\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: *[immediately drops chipper tone]* \"Well I'll get you over to finances. It'll be a brief hold.\"\n\nSo I put her on hold and transferred her. Thing is, finances has a hella long phone tree that you can just skip by hitting 2 five times. But she was a bitch so I patiently waited for the automated voice to finish every. Single. Prompt (it's about 2 mins). Then when I got over to finances, I warned the agent that the lady was looking for a fight and transferred her with a polite, \"Alrighty Ass-Tampon, I have *agent's name* from finances on the line and she'll be able to help you out from here. Thank you!\" and I hung up real quick. I was tempted to say \"I have someone who isn't stupid on the line here who will be able to give you just as much information as I did. She most likely won't be able to solve your crippling self-important aggression that makes you think everyone cares enough to be out to get you, but we can transfer you to a therapist who can.\"\n\n**TL;DR-- lady says I'm stupid because I said that her unemployed son who can't make calls for himself miiight need financial aid for college**\n\nI was actually really upset afterwards (I was new-ish to the job) but my coworker said something nice. He was like \"You work in a **help** center. She was calling you for help. If you're stupid, what does that make her?\" \n\nSuper bonus note! I actually start working full-time for finances next month! (I'm currently a student worker) I'm excited to deal with happy flowers like her!\n\n*I work at a University and 90% of our callers are helicopter parents inquiring for their kids ranging in age anywhere from 18-27 and it really annoys me.",

        "text": "I work at support for a web hosting company. It is not unusual for customers to get upset to the point of yelling or cursing. When this happens, we will respectfully remind the customer that we are trying to be professional with them and ask that he/she to do the same with us as it will better help us help them. This usually calms them down and we will end up resolving their issue, and sometimes we will get a sincere apology afterwords. We will tolerate cursing/yelling to a certain extent as we understand how frustrating their problems can be.\n\nThis customer abused our customer service and support staff several times and harassed us for the past month to the point where we had to terminate his account for violation of terms of service (abuse of staff), who was abusive even after warning him of this. This is the termination email that was sent to him. I feel like this email represents the feelings of most call center reps when dealing with these types of customers.\n\n&gt;Hello [ex-customer],\n\n&gt;At this time our management team has determined we are unable to continue to host your websites. We require all of our agents to remain professional and treat each customer with respect. Our agents are expected to refrain from using profane or slang language, using derogatory comments, using a curt or disrespectful tone, and they are to provide each customer with accurate information. We also ask that our customers remain respectful to our agents and refrain from the use of profane language, derogatory, slanderous comments, and disrespectful tones. Yelling or using all caps in a chat with an agent is also considered disrespectful. We understand that when it comes to money and business, tempers and emotions can become inflamed and a person can become passionate about the situation. We just ask that customers understand our agents are working to the best of their ability to assist you, even if the outcome is not aligned with your expectations.\n\n&gt;This has not been the case with our interactions with you. We have been unable to assist with a resolution to your situation due to the abusive and hostile nature you have exhibited with our agents. At this time we will be terminating your account. Our Systems team will be packaging your files and sending you a link in a separate email in which you can download these files. We are very sorry that we can no longer continue a business relationship with you. We wish you well and much success in all your endeavors.\n\n&gt;Best Regards,",

And a manager from our sister site (none of our managers were in) said he should have consulted our policy and precedure site before calling. \n\nAnyone else think this is ridiculous?

Just get me the appointment. \n\nColleague: ma'am I need to confirm your information to make sure we have everything correct. \n\nOld lady: look, I have cancer, I will probably die before I even get to the appointment at the apartment. Get me the damn appointment I am living in a hotel. I don't care what the place looks like, what it offers or what's available. Give me the first available. \n\nColleague *sighs*\n\n\nI wasn't able to pay attention to the rest of the call because of my trainer until the end. \n\nOld lady: okay well you've been very helpful, you've got my address.

It can, but it usually doesn't since I always start early at 6 am. Usually if they just let me off early if anything instead of putting me on later. So I stupidly didn't double check my schedule and assumed I worked at 6am and got up and clocked in and everything. I work from home so all I had to was start my computer and programs on time. An hour into working, I wanted to check when my break was for so I finally logged in and I saw I was scheduled for 6:30 so I clocked in 30 mins EARLY by accident. So instead of working 6 hours like I usually get scheduled for, I was set for 5.5 hrs. \n\nAnd as a result only had one 15 minute break instead of two 15 mins that would come with a 6hr shift. So I asked my Supervisor about it and he wasn't in his office yet and I had to speak with a \"real time coordinator\" who basically just oversees the people working and things like that, so I spoke with them and they said no because I am only working 5.5 hours but I am working 6 hours bc I clocked in early and it's not like I can just clock out. I've already been working. Guys I pleaded and begged for just another 15 minute and they said no, and they basically blamed it on me and that I am out of compliance. \n\nOK WELL THEN FUCK YOU THEN. fuck guys, I'm so done this job is not worth this unhappiness and I'm taking my 15 minute, since I'm already out of compliance. I want to quit so badly and I'm honestly thinking about it. I'm tired of getting treated like a robot by customers and getting yelled at and now by the company I've worked here for nearly 3 years now and I've only gotten one 5 cent raise for taking Spanish calls and it just really shows how little they care about their workers.

I get his information and put together his order pretty smoothly... Then, when I give him his total, he asks me to hang on for a moment while he goes to get his wallet. So I wait... and wait... and wait. It's taking kind of a long time, but a lot of our customers who call in are elderly and it can take a while for them to get around. Besides, I have work that I can do while waiting for him to come back.\n\nFinally, after about 3 minutes, he comes back, but he's pretty irritated.\n\n&gt; Him: Hello? Is anyone still there?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Yes, I'm here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Him: Well, what were you waiting for? You haven't said anything!\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: (confused) Well, you asked me to hold while you got your credit card, so I was waiting for you to come back....\n&gt; \n&gt; Him: Oh... well, I'm back now.\n\nHe calms down a little, realizing his mistake, but proceeds to give me his payment information with just the tiniest hint of attitude... for doing what he asked. At least he couldn't see me rolling my eyes....",

He kept saying \"US representative\" like a frickin' parrot. The account number he gave me was nonsense, so I asked for a phone number. He lost it and demanded my supervisor. I tried to reassure I could help him, and he replied \"I'm done with you\" This is 30 seconds into the call. Then he went on to claim that I am a \"Chinese devil\" trying to deceive him. I went to get my super and in the 20 seconds it took to do so, he had hung up. I suppose some people are just looking to be angry.",

Acct shows she's on a bundle for tv/Internet, so she gets a discount on both. I inform her of the bundle and that sets her off.\n\n'No! The person said I would get TV for free for two years!'\n\nI'm looking thru the notes and I come across when she added the TV.  Of course it's an interaction from field sales. FFS.\n\nNow everyone has got that one other department that they hate. Mine is field sales. They promise potential cx's the world plus a bit more to bring them over from our competitors. They promise exact services for exact prices and when the cx doesn't get those (and they never do), I have to deal with that. Fuck. Field. Sales. \n\nSo this agent has promised the cx two years free of TV, but has just put them on our shittiest bundle. It's this goddamn department that makes the whole company look bad.\n\nAnd the thing that makes me angry the most is the notes from their interaction:\n\n 'added tv'\n\nNothing else, nothing about adding the promo, nothing about giving the TV for free, nothing. So I tell the cx that there is nothing I can do as they have left no notes.\n\nCx then says that she has the agent's direct number, so she will them a call and see what is going on. I encourage her to do so, but I know that she won't get thru to the agent. No one ever does. \n\nAll I could do was hope that she calls back to cancel the TV before she had it for 120 days, because if she does, then the sales agent would lose their commission. She was only about 30 days in, so I'm sure she would have gotten in under that time.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck field sales",

Was averaging 1 to 2 per week before I gave up about 3 weeks ago. Always it was the same: \"we went with someone whose experience more closely matches the job description.\"\n\nI'm... not as crushed as I expected to be. Maybe it's just the last bits of my soul dying, but I have found a resilience I didn't know I had. I actually hit all my metrics for last month with flying colors. The fact of the matter is, at this point, maybe having a job that makes me feel like running away will help keep me pushing for my goal of getting location independent and going on an extended RV trip by the time I'm 34. It's only about 2 years to save up and plan and such.\n\nAlso, if I get a new job right now, I won't have paid time off for my birthday trip in January. Better suck it up at least until then. I'm really concerned, among other things, about my health. The sedentary nature of the job has taken a very noticeable toll on my body. I've gained about 50 pounds that I am having trouble with losing. I was so physically active before I started working, and my entire working life has been in call centers. I just don't know how to mitigate it. \n\nI fell off the Couch to 5 K a week and 2 days ago. Still early enough to get back on that wagon, either after I get home or tomorrow morning. But it's... not helping much. I'm really discouragingly slow. 2 miles in half an hour??\n\nAnd, I stress eat. I'm on break right now, looking at the queue stats on the big TV across the room, and there are 32 calls holding. I'm trapped here in this seat with not even a window. There's nothing else to do to break the boredom and monotony. I *want* to be a permanent RVer and go hiking in scenic lands and shit. By the time I get of here, someone's going to have to roll me around like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So basically I'm kicking ass at work, making decent money, but... I just don't have anything but a sigh of defeat and fatigue.",

I say to the man, \"Sir, hang on here with me for a second while I look at the rate a bit closer.\" \n\nI guess he thought I had put him on hold when a few seconds later I hear him yell, \"ROSE! I just shat my pants again, bring me some new ones!\" \n\nI was laughing so hard I could barely breathe and tears were streaming down my face. But I did not want to put him on hold because then he would start hearing the hold music and realize I heard the whole thing. Once I re-gained a bit of composure I was able to finish out the call. That call definitely got passed around the office and was entertainment for days. ",

Their word is law.\n\nI had a lady call last night asking for more time, mind you the last bill she paid was in August. So at this point I'd probably be only put her on our Installment plan to get her caught up. \n\nExcept! She went above our heads to the commission. \n\nMe: I am sorry ma'am but I'm unable to grant you any additional extensions as you agreed to the arrangement with the Commission. If you still cannot satisfy that agreement you can appeal back to the commission or once your arrangement is not satisfied you can always give us a call back to do the Installment plan. But as long as you have the arrangement we cannot assist you further.\n\nHer: but I need more time.\n\nMe: *repeats stuff*\n\nHer: oh... Okay can I part of it today and the rest next month?\n\n(Note this is a 500+ bill)\n\nMe: you can make a partial payment but your arrangement will not be satisfied. I cannot make any arrangements at this time while your request with the Commission is still on file. Once it has expired we can certainly see what arrangements can be made.\n\nWe cannot refer people to the commission normally unless they already went. It's a fireable offense much like med D plans calling in to Medicare. They don't like it.\n\nBut we'll see how today goes. ",

        "text": "I got a call yesterday from a woman who had just gotten a text message threatening to stop her phone and broadband over a missed payment. I called up the account and it's pretty standard stuff. The missing payment was the very first one, which is always higher than normal due to setup fees. As sometimes happens, when the direct debit failed to go through, our system stopped it altogether. I deal with this exact situation several times a day, so I took a payment and offered to restore the direct debit.\n\nThis is when things got unusual. The direct debit was paid out of her daughter's bank account, which is fine, but the daughter wasn't there. I advised that I would need to get her daughter's permission to set up a direct debit over the phone, so she should call back when the daughter is present. The caller then suggested she could get her daughter on the phone, to which I agreed because hey, might as well save my FCR. So the lady called her daughter on another mobile and pressed the two together so I could get the daughter's permission. Pretty easy all told.\n\nSo then I went to actually set up the direct debit and asked for the bank sort code. Turns out the caller doesn't know this, only the daughter does, so she had to call back and once again press the phones together so I could get the bank details. Everything worked out in the end.\n\nI just get a smile out of the idea that someone actually pulled off the trick Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon did in [this famous clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgCkmUS1IYI) from the 60s *Batman* series.",

Haha no.)\n\nSo today i had the absolute funniest call i've had since the guy that lived in arse crack street.\n\nIt was quite simple. Dealing with a customer's renewal of her car insurance. Wife + husband in their mid thirties, and one vehicle on the policy. It's a bread and butter call, dead simple. \n\nSo we're reviewing a few options, the caller asks a question, and i say \"I don't know, let me check\"\n\nSo i go silent for a few moments as i dig through this lady's policy, and i hear her talking to someone else for a few moments.\n\nI'm not paying attention until she says \"Stop waving your willy at me\" \n\nI can't hold it in, and just let out a little huff of a giggle.\n\nTo which her immediate response is \"Oh god, I thought i was on hold!\"\n\nI had to take a moment to giggle as she shooed her husband out of the room. When we'd both taken a moment to calm down, she came back to the phone and said \"My husband does that all the bleeding time! He's a menace!\"\n\n(willy is a particularly childish word for penis)",

        "text": "I manage a call center at a bank.  I get the calls that the staff cannot handle and the \"I want to speak to your supervisor NOW!\" type of people.  A little about me: I grew up in a yelling argumentative household and  I take a little pleasure in good arguments and displaying the upper hand when someone is clearly in the wrong. \n\nOne day a staff member asked me to pull a call recording of a recent call.  She was helping someone and the customer called her a fucking bitch before hanging up.  They are not expected to take abuse like that and have my permission to give a warning and hanging up.  This customer was in her mid 20's\n\nI called the customer and said that we would no longer be helping her over the phone. If she needed help go to a branch (nearest one was 25 minutes from her house).  It's that or apologize to the staff member. She laughed at me and hung up... Fine, notes were placed on her account that we will not give her service and if there are issues send directly to me.\n\nShe tried to call dozens of times over the next few months.  Each time she was read the notes on the account. I’d listen to the recordings and enjoy them immensely.  When asked to transfer she would always hang up before the call got to me.  Now if she would have stayed on the line and discussed this with me I would have helped her or at least let her know that her behavior was unacceptable and if she could speak with respect, then Id lift the ban.  \n\nAs time went on she got bolder and would tell the staff that “I spoke to him and the ban should be lifted!”  Just make up some bullshit each time she called.  Finally after 9 months of this I decided to call her back and see if we could work something out.  I explained why the ban was there and how her behavior was unacceptable.  \n\nShe says *\"I'm recording this call and will send it to my lawyer.\"* \nMe: *Ma’am, in my experience when someone has to say they have a lawyer, they don’t have one. What exactly would you tell your lawyer?*  \n\nWe argue a little back and forth, she threatens to let us come pick up the truck she has a loan on.  Eventually I get her to apologize (not a sincere bone in her body), and lift it.  If you cannot speak properly to them, I will make this ban permanent do you understand?  She agrees.  \n\nThat was that.  I lifted the ban.  I’d like to exact more revenge and consequences for being a total garbage human being  but at the end of the day my job is to keep things smooth and not be childish.  It is just a matter of time before she abuses again, she is just one of those people that wasn’t raised to respect others.  \n",
