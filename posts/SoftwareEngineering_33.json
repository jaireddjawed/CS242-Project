What makes a \"Good\" engineer?\nThis is how I see things, please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\n- Algorithms &amp; data structure: Very adept at simplifying logics and algorithms and making things run faster. \n- Architecture: Knows and practices all the big names in architecture and understands the classic books. \n- Frameworks: Understands the latest and greatest names in the IT world and has a finished sample project in each of these frameworks, whether they are for making apps (i.e. any big and new JS framework) or ones that makes developing a project simple (i.e. Boost or Rx libraries). \n- Multi-disciplined: Has a decent understanding in frontend -&gt; backend -&gt; mobile -&gt; gaming -&gt; databases -&gt; scripting languages and frameworks and can easily learn a new language in those realms. \n- open-source: Has many open-source contributions and is actively involved in projects. \n- Degrees: Has a master's in CS\n\nWhich of these things to pursue?\n\nLike, I know that to make a \"Good\" sysadmin, you'd need to have a bunch of certifications under your belt. If you wanna be a \"Good\" networking specialist, you gotta have come Comptia+ and OWASP certifications as well. For game developers, they gotta know the top game engines. There is a clear line to follow.\nI have no idea what to follow when it comes to being a \"Good\" software engineer. Should one focus on all of the above or follow one of them or what exactly?\nI know this question is a bit too broad, but I would truly appreciate the time and effort it would take to answer.",

They are both ok and straight forward, they describes how the states are changing in the machine or what follows after an event has occurred.\n\n\nBut, a ListIterator is an interface, the actions it will take are based on how the user implements them, and we do not know how they will be implemented.\n\n\nThe functionalities that need to be included in the model are getting an item from list, removing an item from list, and iterating over the list.\n\n\nCan anyone give me an example of what a Behavioral model for an interface or even a class looks like?\n\n\nI am lost, since the professor's examples are not based on what they are asking us to do.....\n\nThank you.",

I finished my project and my colleagues finished theirs. But my colleagues have moved on to work on some different modules and i am only getting my defects and also their defects to work on. How to deal with this. Is this normal or am i being sidetracked?",

I've also some work on the Travelling Salesman Problem, creating my own algorithm and comparing it to currently existing solutions... \n\nNot sure what I should do, any help would be appreciated.",

        "text": "I have certain events I'm logging. In some cases they are simply that an event took place (for example, a RabbitMQ/AMQP notification or that a function was invoked). In other cases, they measure how long some event took to complete (for example, a blocking RabbitMQ call, an REST API call, a function/loop iteration, a DB read/write).\n\n\nFor example, I might have the logs:\n\n    (time = 12:00)\n    RPC_func1: elapsed = 4 seconds\n    DB_read_data: elapsed = 1 sec\n    FN_delete event\n    FN_delete event\n    RPC_func1: elapsed = 3 sec\n    DB_read_data: elapsed = 2 sec\n    FN_delete event\n    RPC_func1: 5 sec\n    DB_read_data: 5 sec\n    (time = 12:09:59)\n\n\nI was originally planning on using logster (developed by etsy), a log tailing utility that aggregates data from log files into time series data, aggregating stats from last time it was invoked: https://github.com/etsy/logster\n\nThis might run as a cronjob every 10 min, I have 3 metrics: RPC_func1, DB_read_data, and FN_delete. For the first 2, I can compute the mean/median/percentiles . For FN_delete I can just record that it occured 3 times.\n\n**I already have this working**. I'm using Logster's stdout to re-direct to another logfile, and have it run as a cronjob every 10 min. For example, here's a snippet for how long a VM took to spawn, with timestamp:\n\n    cat &lt;otherlogfile where we redirect stdout from logster&gt;:\n    1503603001 spawn.num_count 1\n    1503603001 spawn.mean 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.median 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.90th_percentile 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.95th_percentile 14.36\n    1503603602 spawn.num_count 6\n    1503603602 spawn.mean 24.78\n    1503603602 spawn.median 20.035\n    1503603602 spawn.90th_percentile 37.025\n    1503603602 spawn.95th_percentile 42.5975\n\n\n\nBut that's not very useful. SO I was thinking of using Graphite to store and visualize the metrics: https://graphiteapp.org/\n\nI was first thinking of using logster's Graphite plugin to just send that data over directly to Graphite.\n\nBut thn I've been hearing a lot about things like Prometheus, statsd, etc... in the enterprise world. Is my approach the best way? Or are there better tools to achieve what I'm doing. Apparently statsd was ALSO developed by the folks at etsy, and i've been hearing more about it, and this also can send data to a Graphite backend. Then I've been hearing a lot about Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/) which is another time series database that also does alerting - not sure if alerting and monitoring can be done by Graphite too - but this might be useful in addition to visualization\n\n\n",
