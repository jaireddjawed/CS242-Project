There are literally dozens of creative mnemonics that makes memorizing kanji a bliss.\n\nHopefully WK implements a resource like Koohii, because as a paid resource, it's no more than a glorified SRS system with different radicals.\n\nEdit: Being a bit more objective, WK at least tries to help you memorize the readings, and sometimes it works.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm subscribed to the official YouTube channels for a few Japanese news outlets, and I find that, for every 10 depressing stories and 10 kinda boring ones, there‚Äôs one or 2 really cute ones, whether it‚Äôs a wholesome thing with animals (I love cats so cat videos are the best), or something like, really innocuous, like a story about a strawberry farm and how all these different products are being made from the special berries harvested from there (I just watched one about that so I‚Äôm using it as an example lol). I saw this other great one about a day where meat was on sale and there were massive lines around the block to get into delis (sales seem so popular in Japan from the news stories I‚Äôve seen! So many people in line to get a good deal on eggs it‚Äôs crazy!).\n\nI can always tell immediately what kind of story it‚Äôll be (is it about food / culture / cute animals, or is it about war and pestilence) based on the tone of the announcer. Even a relatively ‚Äúboring‚Äù story is entertaining to me if the announcer‚Äôs voice is super relaxing to listen to or a super over the top ridiculous tone, etc. My YouTube subscription feed is like 90% Japanese news stories (even though I only end up watching such a small portion) so even if it‚Äôs a playlist that‚Äôs not currently being updated, and just has, idk, 50+ mundane / cute / cool new gadget etc news stories, even ones from years ago, that works plenty fine for me, it doesn‚Äôt have to be *NEW* news; I saw a great one the other day of a cat jumping out of a window like 20 stories up on a building and sticking the landing unharmed, and that was news from 6 months ago I think. If there isn‚Äôt a playlist like that I guess I‚Äôll have to make one lol.\n\n*TLDR: looking for a YouTube playlist with clips from Japanese news outlets that are cute, interesting or funny with a light tone so that I can practice my listening. The news stories don‚Äôt have to be recent, I just want to listen to natural (as natural as someone can sound reading a script or from a teleprompter, but natural enough) Japanese speech with something wholesome to look at.*\n\nI appreciate the help &lt;3",

I need someone to explain how to use this in a sentence please. Teach me it as if I'm a 5 year old child. I need the most basic dumbed down version you can give because it's just not clicking with me.\n\nI understand that it's essentially the \"ness\" form in English. Cold - coldness, sweet - sweetness, hot - heat etc. I also know I drop the „ÅÑ and add „Åï. But in terms of sentence I'm not getting it at all.",

        "text": "So I've been using flashcards for like 1.5 years now which isn't a lot but it definitely always felt like a great method for studying pretty much anything that you are capable of simplifying into a small double sided card but especially recently I noticed that I began to get worse with remembering the cards and I didn't know what I was doing wrong and just assumed I'm getting tired from studying daily but I don't study a lot and it worked very fine in the past so I wasn't satisfied with the answer. I then came up with a theory that you could describe as followed:  \n\n\nThe volume of studying or the amount of time you have to spend to study an amount of flashcards depends on 2 factors:  \n1. The quantity of (the same) flashcards you review in a certain amount of time and  \n2. The quality of actually recalling the content of the card   \nThe quality would be trying hard to actually recall the cards content before looking at it's solution.  \nYou could maybe write that as Volume = Quantity \\* Quality\n\n  \nNow what I apparently recently fell into is a trend in which I focussed on the quantity of reviewing a certain amount of cards in a shorter amount of time because I thought the mere increase in exposure to many cards would help me to remember things more quickly and not waste time trying to recall that one card for like 10-20 seconds. Now that I noticed that this might be the problem I tried to reverse that tendency by only focussing on trying as hard as possible to remember the cards as soon as I see them.   \nTo make this more clear compare this: You study new flashcards and after seeing a new card once, the next time you see the card you will take your time to try to recall that card instead of giving up after 5 seconds instead of thinking \"nah I don't know anymore\" and looking at the answer. Each time you now see a card you will take as much time as you need (that doesn't exceed like 30 seconds or so since after that time you probably can't recall the card yet) to remember the card. Then you just repeat every card until you can recall it in about under 5 seconds or less.  \n\n\nDoing that first of all made me remember a new card after seeing it on average twice or thrice instead of an average of 8 times when skipping more quickly and not properly trying to remember things as well as keeping the then newly learned words for a lot longer than if I were to do it the other way around.  \n\n\nI don't know if this is helpful to anyone but I thought since it was helpful to me right now I might as well share the experience",

If the number of (English) loanwords continues to grow then someday the language will just be half Japanese and half English with added vowels. People won't know where these words came from. They just memorize the words and have no chance to discover the roots. For example: „Ç®„É¨„Éô„Éº„Çø„Éº. In English you can guess the meaning of \"elevator\" by the verb \"to elevate\". Since the English skills of Japanese people are poor they won't get this connection. I'm kinda sad about it and using those loan words feels off for me because I want to use the \"correct\" pronouciation but can't because they won't understand me otherwise. I know that every language goes through change but 20 percent is a lot. Korean has about 4 percent btw.",

I haven't been able to locate any place where I could purchase those, or any obvious place to find mp3s of the content.\n\nAny thoughts or leads? I find it covers enough ground for me to get by when I travel for leisure, just have never had the audio to go with and thought it would be nice to have. I'll pay if its available for sale..",
