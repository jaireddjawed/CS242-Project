        "text": "I mean think about it. The government can seize property with a legally-valid reason. Like if you get arrested, you aren't allowed to have a cell phone in prison. But there's no way they'd be able to separate you by force from a part of your body. Right now, this isn't a problem for the government, because nothing the government would ever have any need to take away from someone would exist as a part of their body. In other words, they're benefiting from a person's inability to have as a body part something that they'd have an interest in confiscating.\n\nOf course, if people *did* have the ability to have something like that as a body part, like a cell phone or a knife, they'd have a right to do so, as it's their body. The government can't say it's illegal to have a body that doesn't fit their standards. Well, maybe they can say it, but that would certainly not go over well with the people.\n\nPerhaps a distinction could be made between implanted devices and natural ones. After all, an implant can be safely removed, and the removal certainly wouldn't be irreversible because otherwise they wouldn't have been able to get it implanted in the first place. But then, what if people start getting implants that are designed to be impossible to safely remove, specifically to prevent law enforcement from removing it against their will? And what if genetic engineering reaches the point where anyone can modify their DNA to grow pretty much anything they want (as long as it's simple enough) as a body part? If the government can forcibly remove that body part, then when you get down to it, that really isn't any different from forcibly removing something like one of your hands, which obviously wouldn't be okay.\n\nSome people may find this to be a problem. I sincerely hope this doesn't get in the way of research. Personally I have extremely-liberal views when it comes to freedom of the individual, so the way I see it, if the government doesn't want people having that level of control over their bodies, that's their problem, and I hope the scientific community doesn't take any steps to make that easier for them at the expense of individual people.\n\nHas anyone else wondered about things like this?",

My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my life and the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others.\n\nWhen I believed [that personal identity is what matters], I also cared more about my inevitable death. After my death, there will be no one living who will be me. I can now redescribe this fact. Though there will later be many experiences, none of these experiences will be connected to my present experiences by chains of such direct connections as those involved in experience-memory, or in the carrying out of an earlier intention. Some of these future experiences may be related to my present experiences in less direct ways. There will later be some memories about my life. And there may later be thoughts that are influenced by mine, or things done as the result of my advice. My death will break the more direct relations between my present experiences and future experiences, but it will not break various other relations. This is all there is to the fact that there will be no one living who will be me. Now that I have seen this, my death seems to me less bad.\" -  **Derek Parfit, 1942-2017**",
