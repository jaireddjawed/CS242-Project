Although two of our outcomes might best be thought of as ordinal categorical variables (i.e., math and science coursework), for simplicity, we specify all outcomes as continuous.

I want to check if ya'll if my statements are correct. Thanks!\n\nAtmospheric nitrogen enters the soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (only present in anaerobic conditions) convert nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrifying bacteria (only present in aerobic conditions) convert the ammonia into nitrites and nitrates, which contain oxygen and nitrogen. The nitrites and nitrates either gets consumed by plants via roots, or gets converted back to atmospheric nitrogen by denitrifying bacteria, thus repeating the cycle (only present in anaeronic conditions). The nitrogen gets consumed by plants, and the plant waste produces ammonia which allows the cycle to repeat itself.\n\nIs all of this true? I also have some questions:\n\n1. Are nitrites and nitrates considered plant nutrients?\n2. How does algae affect the bacteria mentioned? Algae oxygenates water (water enters soil) and thus algae causes the soil to become aerobic right?\n\nThank you for reading!",

        "text": "For background, I am brainstorming ideas for a one chip digital camera sensor that has all around better image quality. The improvements will be in color resolution and fidelity, spatial resolution, SNR in low light, lower chroma and luma noise, less read noise (or lower corrupting effects of it), and higher dynamic range and exposure latitude (they are not the same thing technically).\n\nYesterday, I posted about my idea of using a micro splitter in each photosite that separates the colors and sends them to their diodes. After careful consideration, I ruled out my idea because it was not worth the new problems it would create.\n\nI started searching for ideas and research papers. I found a paper on the transverse field detector. An article on Petapixel and a different research paper made comparisons to Foveon. I know that photographers only need 3 color channels (some also want IR and UV). People claim that Foveon has higher color fidelity and color resolution. The same people complain that it has high noise levels at high ISO levels like 800. Bayer has less noise at ISO 800 for a comparable recording area.\n\nWould the transverse field detector have less noise of three types: chroma, luma, and banding noise? What new problems should be factored in? With only three color channels needed, is it a good idea to use binning to combine the electrical charges from different colors to make the three channels? What new problems should be factored in for this?\n\nFor improving quality of shadows, midtones, and dynamic range; I thought about logarithmic A/D conversion. My idea for going around the linear nature of the ADC is to have the amplifier adjust the analog gain by amplifying the weaker signals more than the strong ones. The idea is so the dark regions are elevated to higher ground to get away from the read noise at the bottom. Shadow and midtone quality is more important then the highlights; they will be compressed more. On a side note, some photographers intentional overexpose negatives because degraded highlights within reason are more pleasing than suddenly cutting off. My objection to linear curves is that one stop before highlight clipping takes the upper half of the ADC range. What new problems should be factored in?\n\nWhat advice and subreddits for discussion do you have in mind? Thanks in advance.",

The question is a little on the outer edge of credibility so I'm guessing there will never be an answer, but here goes (treat all givens as if you're solving a proof):\n\nIf a planet about the size of Mars was flung out of its system hard enough to exit the gravitational pull of its parent star, in such a way that it survived the destructive forces in such a change of velocity, and that the new trajectory was a canted orbit of the galactic center of a spiral galaxy, how long would it take to get to a place where the galactic center would be a significant light source? Not necessarily bright enough provide sustenance for life, but rather something more like the brightness of a lantern, all across that hemisphere. Knowing that there's a minimum speed for such a trajectory to succeed, please consider the weakest source of gravity or force necessary. No values have to be exact; I'm looking at a timeline in which just this thing occurs: the amount of time between the heretofore undefined outside force acting upon the planet to fling it, however achieved, into the aforementioned orbit of the galactic center, and the cluster of stars being far enough away to shed a low but easily visible patina of light on the surface of said planet.\n\nGood luck, and thanks for playing. Anyone who answers with a decent answer can have a copy of my story when it's finished. I know it isn't much of an incentive, but it's all I have. Consider, if you will, reading this story later in life, and really enjoying every part except where the author got the math abhorrently wrong. I know; detestable.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the help, it's clear to me now that my idea just isn't feasible in reality as we know it. Next idea/option is a white dwarf.

The idea was to deliver high quality and avoid the limits of the helicoid design.\nI know the next challenge for making curved camera sensors is the zoom. What I observed with traditional zoom lenses is the geometric distortion varies by focal length. Would eliminating the helicoid design and replacing it with something better help with maintaining precise distortion throughout the zoom range? This is so the elements correcting the distortion can eliminate the distortion. This is for curved camera sensors. Would it also be possible to make it compatible with the autofocus of an interchangeable lens camera?\nThe articles with the lens are below:\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/articles/6896135379/a-forgotten-solution-why-this-strange-1975-zoom-lens-is-so-sharp\nhttps://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/09/the-minolta-40-80mm-f2-8-gearbox-zoom-the-clockwork-lens/",

        "text": "Recently, I thought about an idea for a new TV display technology. It works by using ultra thin laser diodes connected to microlenses. In every pixel, there is a laser for red, green, and blue. The light from the three lasers get blended with a microlens.\n\nIf feasible, the microlenses for the display can also blend groups of pixels to enable more then one native resolution. For example, let's say the maximum resolution is 3840x2160 and you want to play material at 1920x1080. The pixels will get in groups of 4 and the microlenses will blend them together to prevent the blocking effect caused by nearest neighbor interpolation. If possible, it will also be applied to 1080i (interlaced) material by blending odd and even lines that refresh. It may eliminate the deinterlacing requirement.\n\nIf feasible, the microlenses may also be used for stereoscopic imaging display (known as 3D). Ideally, I want to eliminate the need for special glasses.\n\nThe idea of lasers is when combined with a refresh rate of 600 Hz, it will enable higher quality video. The 600 Hz rate will use no interpolation, just repeat the frames in a group of refreshes. The lasers will enable extreme gaps between the bright and dark point in the same frame. It enables ultra dark pure black and ultra bright highlights because all pixels are locally controlled.\n\nThe technology must be ultra thin for use on small devices like phones and flat screen TVs alike.\n\nWhat are some ways this technology can be developed? What new problems should be factored in? Are these ideas technically feasible? Why or why not?\n\nWhat are some good subreddits for this discussion? What is your advice in general?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "The point of my idea is to eliminate a tradeoff between 3CDD and the Bayer pattern.\n\nThe 3CDD system uses one prism to separate red, green, and blue. There are three chips, one for each primary color. While fewer photons are lost, is inefficient with precious materials because three chips are used.\n\nThe Bayer pattern is easier to implement. It uses only one chip. The downside is a major portion of photons are filtered out. The Bayer interpolation forces more computing power. Because only one of the three colors are recorded, it makes it difficult to compress RAW digital cinema footage.\n\nMy solution is called the Single Chip Micro Splitter. It combines the high photon collection of 3CDD with the simplicity of the Bayer pattern. It works in which at every photosite, there is the microlens, a prism like splitter, and three photo diodes. The splitter splits the light into the three colors and directs each color to its diode. The wiring will be behind the diode to improve efficiency by reducing photons that bounce outward. Because no demosaicing is needed, RAW images will be easier to compress and downsampling while in RAW is feasible. Lossy RAW compression methods can be used. They can interframe with GOP or intra only.\n\nOther ideas for a better camera sensor includes logarithmic A/D conversion. This brings the shadows and midtones higher to reduce the effects of read noise and improves shadow quality. The highlights are more compressed as a result. This will enable very high dynamic range in only 12 bits per channel.\n\nAnother improvement what I call XDR (extended dynamic range). It works in which if a region is collecting photons at an extremely rapid pace, the photon collection stops early and everywhere else stops on time. Let's say the exposure time is 1 second and XDR setting is 3 stops. The region collecting photons at a rapid pace will stop at 1/8 of a second while everywhere around the region will stop at 1 second. This is good for flame lit scenes with the actual flame in the frame.\n\nWhat are some new problems I should factor in with these ideas? What is your advice on how to work around them? What workarounds do you have in mind?\n\nWhat are some good subreddits for this discussion? What is your advice in general?\n\nThanks in advance.",

However, my Terrarium design makes it difficult to control water levels and sometimes, the substrate becomes waterlogged and thus causing problems like root-rot. I am looking into algae (in the water that the plants receive) as a solution to this.\n\nMain statement: Algae in water is good for plants when in controlled amounts.\n\nAlgae oxygenates water.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://aquaplant.tamu.edu/faq/dissolved-oxygen/](https://aquaplant.tamu.edu/faq/dissolved-oxygen/)\n\n\\[[http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/manage/overview-of-florida-waters/water-quality/dissolved-oxygen/\\\\\\](http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/manage/overview-of-florida-waters/water-quality/dissolved-oxygen/)](http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/manage/overview-of-florida-waters/water-quality/dissolved-oxygen/](http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/manage/overview-of-florida-waters/water-quality/dissolved-oxygen/))\n\n[http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/earth-science/water-quality/oxygen-and-carbon-dioxide/](http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/earth-science/water-quality/oxygen-and-carbon-dioxide/)\n\nPlant roots require oxygen, which comes from air pockets in the substrate. When plants are in boggy conditions where there are few air pockets in the substrate, the plants suffer from root rot. Algae prevents this as algae oxygenates water, and the oxygenated water can then be absorbed by the plant's roots. In fact, oxyenated water can allows beneficial microorganisms in the substrate to thrive! Thus, algae in water benefits plants.\n\nSources:\n\n[http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/generaltopics/Tree\\_Growth\\_Structure/Photosynthesis\\_Respiration/](http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/generaltopics/Tree_Growth_Structure/Photosynthesis_Respiration/)\n\n[http://aces.nmsu.edu/ces/yard/2006/092306.html](http://aces.nmsu.edu/ces/yard/2006/092306.html)\n\n[http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=730](http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=730)\n\n[https://www.maximumyield.com/dissolved-oxygen-the-hidden-necessity/2/970](https://www.maximumyield.com/dissolved-oxygen-the-hidden-necessity/2/970)\n\nIn fact, water that is poorly-oxygenated will take away oxygen from plants as well as deplete the oxygen in the substrate!

Plants respire and absorb oxygen all the time, but only photosynthesize only when there is sunlight available. This becomes a problem when there is excessive amounts of algae in the water as during a cloudy day/period of time where the algae doesn't receive sunlight, the algae will still respire and absorb oxygen. The massive amounts of algae will rapidly deplete the supply of dissolved oxygen supply in the water, which lowers the oxygen levels in the water.

Algae on the surface of the substrate can be unsightly. Thus, too much algae in water negatively affects the appearance of the substrate.\n\nEDIT: I have one question - what elements are released when algae decomposes?",

And this made me curious about what the actual damage would be.\n\nLet's ignore obvious plotholes like how a person's muscles aren't strong or durable enough to accelerate objects to relativistic speeds, or that objects might teleport rather than accelerate to high velocity if moved when time is stopped, or that a pair of pants would disintegrate before the entire mass could hit a significant portion of lightspeed. \n\nLet's instead assume the mass of a pair of pants were successfully accelerated to near lightspeed, and was moving in the direction of the ground. How much energy would be unleashed on impact, and what would the likely extent of the damage be to the planet?",

So not in a gastric and bile acid-resistant capsule shell.\n\nWould there still be a correspondingly effective amount of bacteria in the small and large intestine arrive?\n\nAdditionally: Many people eating processed food with preserving agents which could kill many lactobacillales. And they taking antibiotics like chewing gums and often wrong. They eating fast food or something similiar and barely no fermented food like 70 years ago. Few years ago in Netherlands they searched for fecal donors and the researchers tested the samples always and found that almost every donor had barely lactobacillales but harmful bacteria.",
