Is Flatpak the lesser evil? Is it a second edition of the LBS agreements? Will containers or virtualisation eventually turn this problem obsolete?

Other stuff updates normally and works for me. However, on the web people recommend to switch to the long-term-support version of the kernel in such a situation.\n\nI'm wondering what does LTS mean in this context exactly. Since the Kernel version is much older than non-LTS version, how exactly is it \"supported\"? Does it get some incremental security updates outside of official version releases? Or does it mean some additional software compatibility?\n\nWhat is the advantage of using an LTS kernel vs the newest Kernel that works for me, that is not as new as the newest version, but isn't as old as the LTS version either?",
