If this phrase is true, then what is the point of doing anything in the first place if everything cancels out. For instance, if you go through suffering in order to feel better afterwards such as taking a cold shower, wouldn’t the suffering experienced in the cold shower equate to the pleasure received after getting out of the shower? Thus, the net gain would be zero which means there is no point in doing it. I would really appreciate any insight on this as this theory that I created in my mind has been bothering me and I need answers.",

I'm curious if one is preferred or if anyone knows of any work talking about this distinction from a historical perspective or whether both are equally valid and separate senses.\n\nThe first, more technical definition I see is that we take the *opposite* of a given premise, then deriving an absurd or incorrect conclusion from not-A. \n\nThe second, seemingly more intuitive but also seemingly less common definition I see is that *reductio ad absurdum* simply refers to any time we develop or infer absurd or contradictory consequences or conclusions from a given premise via any form of dialectic, discussion or inference. In other words just clearly 'reducing something to the absurd' by demonstrating unacceptable consequences of a given premise. \n\nAny light shed on this is appreciated. Thanks!",

While absurdism surely looks like my way out, im still kinda confused on why i should do anything. Like what activities should i fill my life with? Except for spending time with loved ones, i dont see any other reason to do anything. Before i became a nihilist i had dreams and ambitions, and i constantly pursued them.

Having read chapter 4 and a bit of 5 from Being &amp; Time I think I'm starting to get most of what he's saying although I'm having a hard time grasping the meaning of Da-sein. I believe my confusion stems from the difference between being as a verb and a noun. Is he talking about being as a mode of existence or an existing object. Sometimes he seems to do both maybe in my opinion. \n\nBut I was listening to Philosophize This and while he didn't say it was Dasein and was still talking about Husserl he was mentioning Descartes' Wax question. What makes a piece of Wax, Wax. What aspect of it, if changed, changes the being of it. And I believe the guy said that only if Wax was made out of water would it be something else because it wouldn't be Wax but water. \n\nIn analogy to this, if you change Wax to human existence would Da-sein be the answer to it? The fundamental element or aspect about a human being that makes it exist and fundamentally a human being. And it would be the way that a human is?\n\nIf I'm wrong would anyone have a similar analogy or example with something different that would help me understand Da-sein better? Thanks in advance",

To define and therefore understand something infinite, it is therefore necessary to place a limit on it - making it finite - which is contradictory.\n\nFor example, If one hypothetically had infinite land, it would be impossible (i.e. a contradiction) to put a fence or boundary around it to define it. Doing so limits and therefore contradicts its infinite nature.\n\nAlso, defining the land (or a term with the quality of being infinite), also implies there is something else outside of it (e.g. A and non-A) which would also be contradictory... since it is infinite.\n\nSince our minds need finite definitions for understanding - including of that which is infinite -  how is this problem dealt with?",

I'm not particularly well educated but I try to stick to logical arguments as best I can. However I'm getting the sense that my cousin doesn't like arguing in good faith.\n\nRecently I've noticed he will make a generic claim that results in an easy true or false conclusion in order to \"win\" an argument but never follows up with an implication to the claim. For example a question from a recent conversation.\n\n\"True or False. Even if you falsely take a man's freedom away, he will still in fact have other freedoms\".\n\nI believe his point is that you can't truly take the man's freedom because he is free to do other things. We were being extremely literal at this point and I thought to myself that, sure, the man could still be free to see and breathe but that doesn't mean you didn't take his freedom away. I asked him to finish his claim but he insisted his question was all his argument needed, to which I disagreed.\n\nMy expectation is that a true argument would require a conclusion, such as...\n\n\"Even if you falsely take a man's freedom away he will still have other freedoms, \\*therefor\\* taking his freedom is...\" (good, bad, fair, unfair, etc). But he refuses to make any definitive statement other than the first descriptive claim. My take is he wants to avoid the chance of being wrong as much as possible, but I may completely be off myself. Does this have a name or is it a fallacy of some type? Or am I the one that's backwards here?\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOD CREATED THIS WORLD FOR ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nWe shall not criticize God for creating the world for His entertainment. He has not created this world for getting any entertainment from the suffering of souls like a sadist. The reason is that we are responsible for our suffering.\n\n*If the entertainment of somebody goes on without any injustice, such entertainment can’t be criticized.* A rich person, starting a college to pass on his time in good path, started an institution. He maintained the institution with utmost justice and lack of trace of injustice. A few students failed because of their negligence to studies. These students criticized the rich man for starting the institution, in absence of which, such critical situation would not have come to them! The entertainment of God is not as cheap as playing chess etc., as observed in souls. *His entertainment is very pious and in very high level.* His entertainment is only to experience the devotion of top level devotees in the creation.\n\nAn ordinary man is entertained by several useless and cheap items. The entertainment of God is not for such cheap items just to kill the time. God is beyond time and need not kill it. *If you observe this creation carefully, every soul is giving highest value for the concept of love.* The enjoyment of pure love proved by various tests is the climax of entertainment and nothing is equal to this. Every soul obtains the maximum climax of happiness only in love. When such love is real as proved by severe tests, the happiness of the soul reaches its climax and this is called as a specific bliss. \n\nHence, the sole purpose of this creation is to enjoy this specific bliss. God has already this variety of bliss. But, when this type of bliss comes in a scene showing devotees proving their real love to God, the bliss is really enjoyable. For such scene, God alone is not sufficient. Something and somebody other than God also must exist. God is not entertained because of not having such bliss expressed in a scene containing multiplicity of items like various entities of creation and various souls. A soul like Radha is required to prove such real and extraordinary love to God. Such proof comes only when other souls opposing Radha also exist as the required components of the scene. In such multiple creation only, the proof of the real love can be expressed causing the unique bliss. \n\nBliss without creation exists in God before this creation. Same bliss in the light of the scene of creation looks as a different bliss. It is another variety of bliss. Hence, we can say that God was fond of this specific variety of bliss for entertainment. Such bliss is not possible if God is alone. Apart from souls, inert materials are also required. For example, Gopikas are the several souls and the inert materials are milk, curd and butter. Both inert and non-inert items are required for this entire drama. Therefore, God wished for a second thing, which at once is materialized (*sa dvitiyamaichchat...* Veda). This second item is the cosmic energy that took various forms like matter, awareness etc., resulting in various inert materials and living beings. This second item itself is multiplied into various forms. Hence, second item means the cosmic energy that transformed into multiple items only, which form this creation. \n\nAwareness also is a specific work form of the inert cosmic energy only. All this stage with various materials like drama dress, various actors were arranged only to express the unique and top most concept of love. *Entertainment with such highest concept should not be taken as cheap entertainment.* A scientist gets entertainment in his research work. A philosopher gets entertainment with the study of various theories in the spiritual knowledge. A devotee is entertained with the most pious worship. All these are not cheap entertainments, though they are basically entertainments. Entertainment by playing cards, drinking wine etc., can be treated as cheap and bad entertainments.\n\n*Entertainment is like eating food.* Eating precious food can’t be equated with eating some bad food. Even though, eating is common in both, the process of eating becomes good in the case of good food and becomes bad in the case of bad food. *Mere process of eating should not be always linked to bad food only.* It is not the point of entertainment, but, it is the point of the way in which one is entertained. When some soul loves you above everything, everybody and even above self-prestige and at last even above the self-life, can you imagine the intensity of bliss you get? It is for this bliss of enjoying the purest and highest love from a blessed soul, God created this world and also enters it in a role called as human incarnation (*Tadevaanupraavishat—* Veda, *Maanushim tanumaashritam—* Gita).\n\nLord Krishna was so much pleased with Gopikas, who have sacrificed everything and everybody for His sake that He created Goloka above His abode (Brahma loka) and the pacification of His love by that is beyond words. All this is not possible if Krishna alone exists without creation. This does not mean that Krishna was not pleased and was unhappy before the creation. He was perfectly happy since there is nothing that was not attained by Him or remains to be attained by Him. *There is no point of lack of satisfaction resulting in unhappiness even before creation.* We can say that though He was fully happy, He wanted enjoy this variety of happiness. \n\nSame point is explained in the Brahma Sutra (*Lokavattu lilaakaivalyam*). *The entire world acts like filling material only and the real spark is that single blessed divine soul only.* If you understand the value of this variety of bliss, you will not misunderstand God and the purpose of His creation. You can analyze this topic from your side also. If creation is not done by God, can you enjoy such bliss from another soul? Why don’t you think the importance of this creation from your side also? When suffering comes, you say that you have to suffer in this creation, which was created by God for His entertainment. You say “Shall I suffer for the sake of the entertainment of God?”\n\nSuffering in the punishment is certainly horrible, but, you are responsible for such situation. There are several other souls, who are happy without doing sins. Hence, in this type of suffering you cannot and should not blame God. But, the *suffering in the path of love is very very sweet* and one really enjoys it as seen in the case of the suffering of soul for the sake of happiness of his family.\n\nIf it is the divine path, apart from such enjoyment in the path, you are going to benefit in the end in infinite way. You enjoy the suffering for the sake of your family and at the end you realize your illusion when the soul is leaving this body. There is no place for such repentance in the case of God.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nGo to the following website and read the divine knowledge from there,\n\n\\-By Shri Datta Swami\n\nwww.universal-spirituality\\[.\\]org\n\nhttps://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/banner480\\_b3o.jpg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hxwPeghu3cM\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oynwqG5tmDA\n\nhttps://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/universe41.jpg\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace",

But this story is pretty simplistic. I'm less likely, I think, to construct a narrative that involves something that I ate last Tuesday, that set off a chain reaction of events that led me to being grumpy today, even if that is the true cause of my grumpiness. And I think I have a sense that a lot of stories I tell myself about how I'm feeling are far too narrow to be accurate, but I'm not sure if that's true.\n\nI guess this is partially a question about causation, because in some sense I guess I could say I'm grumpy today because of the starting conditions of the universe, or something, and that seems obviously unhelpful. I guess what I'm interested in the question of whether I can ever reliably know the causes of my inner states. Sometimes it seems very obvious — like if I'm on a rollercoaster feeling excited — and other times it feels a lot less obvious — like if I just have some nagging feeling that something isn't right during a normal day.",

What I would like to know is how said concept relates to the mind body problem and how we could attempt to find a solution within transcendental idealism.\n\nI have an intuition that I will lay out shortly, but I've found myself unsure about whether I'm applying Kant's terminology consistently and whether my still rudimentary understanding of the CPR might lead to misapplication.\n\nNote also that my native language is German, because of which I'm reading Kant in German as well. I hope I can translate the terminology into English without hangups regardless! \n\nSo, my intuition is that, similarly to the idea of transcendental idealism, we have to look for the answer in the relationship and dependence between mind and body. \n\nI think Kant would propose a type of dualism in which the body, like the whole material world exists independently of our experience/empirical conception of the world as a thing in itself and is categorized by the mind in terms of space/time and Kant's 12 categories. \n\nIn essence I would assume a Noumenon/Phenomenon relationship between body and mind.\n\nBut it does feel  like this interpretation is too basic, like there's something fundamental I'm lacking.\n\nWell, I hope my explanation was understandable, and thank you in advance for any help regarding this matter!\n\nCheers",

The modern Boolean standpoint, however, is that universal states do not have existential import, and therefore do not relate to reality (e.g. \"All plants are things that need water\" cannot be verified as true given the need to inspect all plants everywhere).\n\nThe first problem I have with the Boolean standpoint is that it seems self-contradictory. For example, in the form of a categorical proposition, the statement \"All universal statements are things that have no existential import\" is itself a universal statement and therefore cannot be valid. \n\nThe second problem is that the Boolean standpoint seems to be demonstrably false, or at least not universally true. For example, if I have a collection of all-red marbles, the universal statement (\"All marbles I possess are red in colour\" is verifiably true, as is subalternation to \"Some marbles I possess are red in colour\", which is invalid according to the modern square of opposition.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are there any thorough discussions on this topic? I ask as I have a personal interest in epistemology, and am currently studying logic (in my own time) as part of this.",

But if I have a preference for my pleasures to be rooted in reality, then preference utilitarianism maintains I ought not hook up to the machine because my preferences are not met. Is this a valid defense?\n\n2. Does preference utilitarianism address the organ harvesting hypothetical better than hedonic utilitarianism? If the dying people have the preference to not have a stranger's organs nonconsensually harvested to save their lives, then organ harvesting goes against the preferences of all agents involved. (I understand that if the dying people do want the stranger's organs harvested, preference utilitarianism does not offer better answers than hedonic utilitarianism.)\n3.

        "author": "CosmicFaust11",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10gdvkl/was_plato_influenced_by_hesiod/",
        "text": "One of the things people like to talk about when it comes to Plato and his influences from previous thinkers is how he was extremely critical of Homer and tried to subvert his influence over Greek culture, religion and society (literally wanting to ban poetry and art). I was therefore wondering whether Plato was influenced at all by Hesiod (contrasting them may also highlight the relationship and development of both mythology and philosophy). This is a contrast that I have virtually never seen discussed before. \n\nI also believe I have found one possible way that Plato was developing an idea previously promoted by Hesiod. In Hesiod’s Theogony one of the most popular ideas is something referred to as the ‘Ages of Man’. The Ages of Man are the historical stages of human existence according to Greek Mythology (and later Roman interpretation with Ovid). Hesiod offered an account of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, in which humans are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from Ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the human condition over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value (but increasing hardness). In Hesiod’s Account we have five ages in total and they include: the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age and the Iron Age. \n\nAn example Plato uses in one of his works stood out to me as ‘Hesidion’ in nature. This can be found in Book 3 in the Republic. It can be seen with Plato’s Defense of the ‘Myth of Metals’. In this work, Plato discussed this concept of the ideal city and he promotes three social classes in this society (the guardians, the auxiliaries, the producers). Plato (with Socrates as the main character in this dialogue) says that all the citizens should be told a “noble lie” (what we may call propaganda today) so as to promote allegiance to the State and enforce its three-tiered/triadic social order. According to this ‘myth of the metals’, every citizen is born out of the earth of the State and every other citizen is his brother or sister. Yet God (or the gods) has framed them differently, mixing different metals into their soul: gold for the rulers/guardians, silver for the auxiliaries, and brass or iron for the producers/craftsmen. Children are usually made of the same metal as their parents, but if this is not the case the child must either descend or ascend in the social order. If ever a child made of brass or iron was to become a guardian, the State would be destroyed. As guardians are made of divine gold and silver, they should have nothing to do with the earthly sorts which have been ‘the source of many unholy deeds’.\n\nNow, for me personally, this seems way to similar to the ideas being promoted by Hesiod to be a coincidence and Plato would of course have been aware of his work. \n\nSo, to close my remarks, what did Plato actually think of Hesiod? Was he in favour of him or was he opposed to him? Do you agree with me that Plato was responding to Hesiod as one of his intellectual antecedents when it comes to the similarity of Hesiod’s ‘Ages of Man’ and Plato’s ‘Myth of Metals’? To what degree is Plato relying on, developing, or contradicting Hesiod? Was Plato even potentially responding to other previous thinkers ideas (other than Hesiod) in Book 2-3 of the Republic (ones that I have not thought of)? Thanks.",

Like, a while loop is something where a program gets stuck with itself, and cannot escape, because the code used a while loop, but nothing was there to stop the loop.\n\nHow this can be applied to your brain and thinking: For example, you start to question why a feeling feels worse than another feeling, if the \"worse\" feeling is that bad, and not processable. Then you feel like that thinking hurts your mind, and start to think why that hurts, why that thinking feels that bad. Then you start to question why the previous thing feels bad, then you start to question again why that questioning feels bad.\n\nBasically, you get stuck in a thinking paradox, just like an infinite \"while loop\" where the program is stuck with itself. You try to break from that loop, but end up creating another loop by overthinking. Then you think about things related to what you think, and get stuck again.\n\nSo how was that experience? How did you escape that overthinking paradox? How much did you overthink about the overthinking problem, got stuck in overthinking again?",
