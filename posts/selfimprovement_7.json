I'm 19 soon to turn 20, I don't go to school or work, but back when I was in school I didn't have any friends except my brother and one guy that I was only friends with thanks to my brother who maintained the friendship and made all the plans etc. I have no idea how to make and/or maintain meaningful friendships and I'd love to learn how to do it from you guys. Do I just walk up to people and introduce myself and ask them if they want to be friends with me? I'm worried that people will think I'm a weirdo. :( Thank you all in advance for your help!",

        "text": "Sorry if this is not the best formatted or written post ever, I had a lot of writer's block trying to connect my thoughts into something sensible, I have class in an hour but needed to talk about my deep inter thoughts, a lot of this is mental rambling but I truly need to vent my issues.\n\nI hate myself. I hate how I am 21 years old but still look like a skinny middle schooler, I hate that I am socially behind all of my peers, I hate my voice, I hate my lisp, I look into the mirror, and I hate myself. \n\nI've been doing self-improvement since 2019, I've been going to the gym for one year its hobby that I love very much but despite all of this I don't feel good about myself.  I'm in university and I feel like I'm behind all of my peers, both socially and physically. I'm not short by any means, I'm around 6\"1-6\"2 but my proportions mixed with how skinny I am just makes me look weird, a lot of other guys my age look their age or older and bigger I have multiple people tell me that I don't look past the age of 17 and that I have a baby face.\n\nSocially everyone seems to be ahead of me by miles, yes, I do have a friend group it the same one I had since freshman year I even have some best friends from uni that I keep in contact with, but I see how everyone's just so much bigger and expansive compared to mines its nothing for some of my friends to just randomly bring up a house party that people in our age range is hosting, everyone lives in an off campus apartment while I'm still in the dorms, I usually spend time in my room by myself, I consider myself an introvert and I'm often alone even in a group I still feel alone but I have no issues holding a conversation and making friends maybe it's my ego but I'm not interested in hanging out with freshman. I'm stuck in a place where I want social experiences, but I don't want to make friends, this was the polar opposite of me my freshman year where I had great success socially after a terrible high school experience.\n\nDealing with women has always been difficult for me ever since I've started to date and it is probably the biggest issue I have, I have been through hundreds of rejections but I have had a decent amount of success, I have been on 2 dates and recently went on one with a girl on valentines day who was interest in me first, after the date I got rejected, then a couple of weeks later she wanted to go on another date after she rejected me, I couldn't go because I had something else to do, then I ask her out she agrees and then she ghosted me? After they reject me, I get into a mind state of wondering what they're doing and wondering if I wasn't enough even though I know some of these situations might not be my fault and there not interested it still bugs me. I understand \"move on you're going to find someone right for you\", and \"you're going to get rejected a lot before you find the right person\". But in all honesty dating might just not be right for me, im the type of person to fix situations if things go bad, but I find with a lot of girls that I talk to, they dip the second things do not meet their expectations and find someone else, I've seen this happen before to me where I was talking to a girl and she literally rejected me and got a bf the very next week. I've had more than one girl who were just verbally abusive to me, and one girl put false charges on my birthday when I was out of state and said on my birthday that I was stalking her after I told her I didn't want to be a side dude to the new guy she was seeing after me while we were talking, lucky I had text messages and location to disprove this.\n\nMy grades are also terrible and I'm so close to flunking out of school, I even considered dropping out, but I decided against it and am doing somewhat better now even though my mental isn't even there.\n\nI went to my school psychologist for a couple of months and described some of these with her, but I know I cannot deeply connect with her in fear of actually opening up to her, from the outside you would never assume that there is nothing wrong with me and I deceived her into thinking I was actually ok when im really not. I have my own issues outside of these but I usually brush them off because I know someone else in the world is going through something way harder and striving to do better, both of my parents are alive, I have a supportive family, and while financially it is a struggle, I never had to go hungry or if I had a house over my head or clothes on my back. because of this I usually brush off a lot of my mental issues. I had some suicidal thoughts but never went through with it because im too strong willed, and I know that the issues I have now arnt the ones that I will have in the future, also there's too much life to be lived so fuck that tbh.\n\nI feel like I have the potential to be great in life, but these obstacles make it difficult for me. I wake up every day hating myself and I want to change that.\n\nuhhh so thank you for coming to my ted talk hopefully you won't judge me too much, I'll be going to class now.",

I guess??) and before I get steamrolled for saying it let me explain. I F20 have Borderline personality disorder (diagnosed at 18). I grew up very isolated from the world, my mother was an alcoholic and my dad was physically abusive and not really emotionally there. I had not a lot of friends growing up due to being socially underdeveloped (and undiagnosed autistic at the time). I was always told up until my senior year of high school I didn’t respect others or their boundaries, not in the “fuck you, I don’t care” way but in the id punch my friends too hard playfully, or say jokes that made them upset without realizing, or not making them feel seen or heard. \n\nI never realized this was a problem until recently but one of my friends asked if I can understand other people having thoughts, and I’m like yeah ofc?? But upon really thinking about it I can’t put myself into another persons shoes. When I see people cry I feel awkward or nothing at all, and when I really care about them I jump to anger. but I can’t imagine other people having lives, complex brains, and personalities. The only time they really exist is right in front of me if that makes sense.\n\nAnyways, I’m 20 now, and it’s caused a lot of hurt because I apparently have tendencies to cut off, or hurt people during “manic” episodes because I genuinely cannot grasp what I’m doing is hurting them in the moment, and I still struggle to make others feel seen and heard. (Personally I feel it comes from always being forced to defend myself as a child). I always assume when someone is mad, or they need to talk to me it’s something I did, or am doing and always get angry and defensive as a trauma response, and it makes people feel really shitty.\n\nUpon reading this does anyone have any advice? It would be much appreciated, thank you!",

I often find myself brooding, overthinking my options and where I should go next, pondering, worrying about the consequences of my decisions.  In reality, I think the more we are uncomfortable, the more we suffer, the more we fail, the more we grow.  There a deep yearning inside of me that wants growth.  \n\nOver the pandemic, I had COVID19 multiple times.  I dropped out of college. All I did while I was sick was play my favorite video games while on unemployment and food stamps and other assistance.  I used the excuse\" Oh we are suffering through a global pandemic\" as an excuse.  While I did enjoy the first few months, I ended up feeling lonely, I realized how much I wasn't growing, how little interaction I was having with others, how much I wasn't experiencing.  The first thing I wanted to do was be an electrician.  I kept looking up videos.  I read a few chapters from a textbook Electricity 1-7.  I thought that was a great way for me to find a career.  I overthought it however.  They say its physically demanding, and dangerous.  I got scared away and discouraged by family and friends.  So I guess I wanted to find a job I enjoy which ended up being Trader Joes.  I really do enjoy this job for the most part.  I do not enjoy all of my co workers but it pays decent enough and its not stressful.  But lately, I have been realizing I do not feel fulfilled with this job.  I am not learning enough and I am not sure if I am happy here.  My first idea was a job at Apple.  But then, I thought to myself, \"what is a job at Apple even like?\" \"Will I actually enjoy this job\"? and its all just screwing me over.  Sometimes its a waste of time even thinking about it when I could be going to the gym or thinking about something more important.",

It's an average business university and I'll be graduating in June this year. I have no job lined up. I was doing an internship but it was unpaid and I felt unfulfilled, so I quit after 2 months. \n\nI often put off doing easy activities because I feel so unmotivated to do them. I lack all general enthusiasm. Although therapy is expensive and I don't have any money, I will think about going. My parents, who live in a normal Asian household, don't care about mental health and believe that the only way to solve any issue is to get up on time. Despite the fact that I am aware of this, I still desire advice from experts and professional assistance.\nI feel like I'll be left behind because my friends are succeeding in life, this makes me even more concerned about my own situation. I'm happy for them, though-- but honestly speaking, sometimes I feel a little jealous. \n\nBecause therapy is currently out of the question as I have no money of my own, I'd appreciate any advice you could give. How do I quit feeling unworthy and find the will to start anything? Should I delete my Spotify account, and just start working and finding internships that would help me boost my career. I do not want to end up like an aimless adult with no ambitions and no career. I want to do something in life, and make my parents and siblings and myself proud. \n\nThank you for reading.

You end up sitting there watching these videos for hours and hours without realizing. Most of the time you don't even feel anything, maybe a small laugh occasionally but the majority of it is mindless scrolling. Most videos are completely worthless as well and don't contribute to your life in any way other than to pass time. Yes, there are some actually worthwhile videos that can be very helpful, but the majority aren't like that. \n\nI cut down the amount of short videos I watch by a lot (most days I don't watch them at all, and on the days I do, the very most amount of time I spend is about 1h) and my free time feels a lot more productive. I have a lot more free time now which I use to do something actually productive, like learning how to play the guitar, or working out, or anything else that doesn't involve screens. I generally feel a lot better now that I've cut it down. \n\nAnd I am aware just completely removing it from your everyday lives is very difficult and it takes a lot of self control/discipline, but it's worth it. If anyone wants to do this, I recommend instead of going cold turkey, just limit the amount per day. See how much you time you usually spend watching short videos, then set a reasonable daily maximum, and keep that up for a bit. Then gradually bring down the daily maximum and continue going like that.",

So I'm devoting at least 30 minutes a day of improv practice while my roommate is around.\n\nThe moral of the story is this: if you suffer from anxiety, exposure therapy is a great way to combat the effects of it and almost get rid of them completely. I've been practicing exposure therapy for years especially for social anxiety. While I still sometimes get nervous if I'm talking to, say a girl I really like, or I'm speaking in front of a bunch of people, I'm so used to the feeling of anxiety that it actually gives me a boost of energy and works to propel me forward!\n\nHope you learned something from this, best of luck!",

Done. \n\nI want video games! Done. \n\nI don’t want to nap. That’s fine. \n\nI don’t want to go to school. Fine, we’ll homeschool. \n\nInitially this worked well, he was happy, I got to rest after a long day. \n\nThen one year passed, then another and before I knew it Jacob had turned 18. \n\n**Then I realized my folly, by kicking the proverbial can down the road so long, I had ruined both my sons future and my own.** \n\nMy son only ate what he wanted when he felt like it and had obesity on top of diabetes and beginning stages of renal failure from the blood clots he’d develop from playing video games for 12+hrs a day. \n\nThe man’s sleeping schedule was irregular so he had to take meds to sleep and it would still be poor further exacerbating his health issues. \n\nSince I withdrew him from school he had little to no education beyond basic elementary school. \n\nNow whenever I bump into my friends and ask about their children I’m filled with envy and shame. All I hear about is how they’re going off to college, about to get engaged, or succeeding in anything from sports to business but all I can say is, “oh Jacob’s doing fine, he’s just figuring things out right now. “\n\nIf I could go back I’d happily run myself ragged if it meant my son would life a healthy, productive, purposeful life. \n\nNow… if you know any of my work you’ll know Jacob isn’t my son. Jacob is an analogy for our future when we give into our cravings just because they put up a good fight. \n\n**When we delay the work to take the easy route, we feel pleasure in the moment, but when It comes time to show the results of our efforts, we’re left empty.** \n\nYou are Jacobs father, jacob is your future self. \n\nYou have to tell yourself:\n\nNo candy, go eat some fruit. (visualize a healthy vs unhealthy jacob) \n\nNo video games, go think about what you want in life. (Visualize a fulfilled vs aimless jacob)\n\nNo skipping school, go read about how to accomplish your goals. (visualize a successful vs unmotivated jacob)\n\nThen when you grow up, you’ll be the proud father, and happier for it.",

I'm just terrible at getting myself to stop when I'm doing something that goes against my self improvement goals.\n\nFor instance, yesterday I ate a whole family size bag of chips in one sitting. I really have no idea what was wrong with me, but I just kept eating and eating. Twice, it occurred to me that I should stop but for whatever reason I just couldn't. I know I sound like a total glutton, but it was like I lost the motivation to stop myself or something. I knew it was wrong, but I kept doing it anyway like I was on autopilot. \n\nI usually avoid this problem entirely by not buying junk food at all, and it usually works but the principle of not being able to control myself when there is junk food around really bothers me.\n\nAnother thing I really struggle with is stopping certain activities. Like if I'm surfing the internet or playing video games, I'll get into this mode where I don't want to stop. Even if I have work to do or chores to take care of, I'll just keep surfing the internet and wasting my time, again on sort of an autopilot function. \n\nI have ways around this as well, like turning off my computer, putting my phone in the other room, etc. but the principle of not being able to control myself when these things are around is a problem for me. \n\nI'm just wondering if anyone has some advice, books to read, content to check out regarding this? Would really appreciate the help because this is becoming a problem for me.",

        "text": "I have gone back and forth and how to process and feel about this.\n\nI got accepted into grad school almost 2 years ago in March 2021. It was joyous to me, as at the time, I was living with my mom and step dad, going nowhere in life socially or professionally. Finally I had something. My first year though, I had no car, and lived on a satellite campus with a shuttle that only went to main campus and back. Virtually no walkability and not much to do. I also have struggled socially with making friends and whatnot. When I started I enjoyed a honeymoon phase where I was high just off having my own place and having a sense of purpose in life again. It, however, didn't last.\n\nWhen the stress of school kicked in I turned to my lifelong habit of avoidance when it came to my problems. Neglecting school (always got most work done though), my living space (less of a pit now), and my health. I just resigned to getting high and not going to class, avoiding any chance to make friends with others and walking a solitary road. My dorm room became a symbol of where I was at my mom's, a room where I lived 80% of my life and sat in isolation. Remains that way still, though marginally less so.\n\nI spread myself too thin, leaving my advisor to join and work with other professors and labs hoping to research what I wanted. I didn't understand at the time that I not only lacked the skills for part of what the project I wanted required, but that just wasn't how grad school in general worked. I made friends, but alienated some of them with my behavior. One of which was seemingly permanent, the other has improved some.\n\nIn short, I was a mess, I was in denial about having second thoughts and lacking motivation, about my avoidance, my other personal issues I wasn't addressing, about my health (still a work in progress), and my habitual weed use. All of which held me back, caused my mom stress and created circumstances where she's had to financially support me, and denied me my true potential.\n\nI missed out on doing a thesis, possibly presenting at conferences, and maybe having a doctoral program or a nice job lined up after. Instead, I will graduate and move back home, moving back in with my mom and step dad, right where I started.\n\nI won't go as far as to say that this was a waste, it wasn't and I don't regret doing it. I am all fired up and more motivated to end the semester on a high note, and have some decent job prospects back home given I'll have a masters. As one doctoral student I work with pointed out, I am still kicking it. Even if I didn't garner the experimental research experience I wanted or needed, I didn't drop out like so many do. I have come to terms with my mistakes in trying not to compare myself to others, but this too is both new and difficult.\n\nWhile I am hopeful of how this semester will go, and may very well end on a high note, I feel disappointed in myself for not making the changes I should have sooner. For now not doing more to have given myself a better outcome. It didn't need to be this way, and the current trajectory suggests it won't stay that way for this semester at least.\n\nSo I don't really know how to feel. I have finally learned after so many painful lessons I failed to learn from earlier, and that is absoltely a positive. Still, I wish it came a year or so ago. I have shelved the PhD pursuit for now to work on myself and to get used to the flow of a job (hopefully one in research). In time I think where I wanted to be will come to fruition, and I am optimistic about this semester. Still, revelations about everything else leaves a lot to be desired in where I need to be.\n\nJust can't quite seem to come to a firm conclusion about what all this meant yet, aside from the issues that needed fixing.",

In fact, I believe that I have a lot of things going for me. I am a intelligent, decent looking and pretty ambitious. But that only makes the aforementioned feeling worse because I either feel that life fucked me over or that I wasted my potential depending on whether I am externalising or internalising. I know that these are not productive feelings but I can’t transcend them at the moment.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?",

Feelings are almost always on the board and seldom needs to be asked to speak up. The board can have members like \"rationale, experience, gut feeling/intuition, future me\" etc., and it's up to each of us to set our board based on what we are working on, and who we would like advice/perspective from.\n\nShe can see the idea and wants to try it out, but she finds it hard get started, since the emotion overwhelms her in these situations and blocks any access to clear/rational thought and \"asking the board\".\n\nAny sources – books/podcasts/articles – about looking at feelings as a perspective/lens more than \"being you\"?",

        "text": "\nThis is going to be rather lengthy. Ok, so this thing has been affecting me since like 2020. I am  a young girl in uni rn and sometimes I feel extremely jealous of my cousin who is the same age as me btw. I noticed it started in 2020 coz I had this aunt (my grandma's sister) come over and stay at our house. So she is the kind who makes favorites and gets obsessed with them. Obsessed in the sense that she is always talking about them and praising them etc. So her favorite was this cousin right. She would always talk about how nice my cousin is and how she is waiting for her to get married to her own grandson. This cousin had always been a really good friend of mine. We grew up together as best friends and now we live in diff countries. I noticed that this constant praise of hers by my aunt really made me insecure and jealous of her. I am not obvi blaming the aunt as I was already dealing with low self esteem issues in 2020 and this was just the icing on cake. Since this incident, any mention of my cousin or praise of her is triggering me so much that I still to this day overthink every moment where she got mentioned or praised since 2020. So she is like the perfect all rounder family favorite in our relative as well coz she goes to a good uni, is pretty, caring and everything. So she gets praised a lot in our relatives like my mom's sisters, cousins are always impressed by her.\n We also have like a family group (all aunt's, uncles, and cousins) and we post photos during birthdays and any festivals to share the celebration. Since I have become so obsessed, I have been noticing and comparing the amount of birthday wishes I get to the amount of wishes she gets. There had been times when we have all posted our family photos and she had been praised the most out of all and my family photos didn't. Also, times when she got more birthday wishes than me. Like before, I wouldn't care (the younger me) but now suddenly I have become extremely aware of these situations and overthink every little thing related to her. This has made me extremely anxious whenever my birthday or any festivals is approaching. All im thinking about is us posting pictures and her getting all the compliments and me not receiving any instead of actually enjoying these amazing moments in my life. Even if I did get compliments, I'd still prob compare the amount I'm getting to the amount she is getting. Mind you, I have a lot of cousins and I wouldn't mind if they got compliments but it only seems to trigger me when she gets it (maybe coz we're the same age)\n\nAnd my mum also loves her. She never compares me with her though coz she is a good mom and knows that comparison takes a toll on kids. But whenever she sees a beautiful actress on TV or a beautiful looking person, she always remembers my cousin and mentions that said beautiful person is looking like my cousin. Recently, she is been doing this a lot and for some reason, it's making me so triggered. I am not the kind of person to get jealous and act on it. I would never treat my cousin in a bad manner just coz of my jealousy. The only one that my jealousy affects is ME. It's only making me feel depressed and low and no one else. I just want y'all to know that I had always been positive minded and I completely understand these negative feelings and thoughts are illogical, but I just can't seem to fight with them. I sometimes cry as to what I ever did in my life to let these thoughts affect me so much to the point I think of it and her every single day of my life. I'm scared that I'm getting obsessed. I don't want to ruin my life with these thoughts. I've never told anyone about these feelings except my little sister who is in middle school. She is the best sister anyone could ever ask for as she has always been so supportive of these thoughts. I can't even afford a therapist as I don't make my own money. I will soon start a job in two years and maybe with my own money, I can afford a therapist. I've just talked to my dad about just getting a therapist in general but he says it's too expensive. I am writing this because im getting these feelings since 2020 and I am still not able to get over these thoughts. What could I possibly do to slowly recover from these thoughts? Talking to my sister has definitely helped because I would have freaking died by keeping all this shit to myself. But my sister is still young and is not the best at advices. That's why I'm turning to reddit and I genuinely want to learn how to rebuild my personality and thoughts such that these things don't affect me anymore. Btw it's not like I'm the unattractive cousin compared to her. I believe I'm also very attractive (maybe not as much as her) and sometimes the relative fav too. I guess maybe that's why in a way competition is creating these jealous feelings. Thanks for coming to my TED talk and I know reading through these things prob made you feel that I'm so immature. Maybe I am. I want to learn to be mature so that these things don't make me depressed. Mostly I want to be better mentally not just coz of myself but also because I love and care about this cousin as we have been best friends growing up and I don't want to have these toxic feelings about her. Thanks and I genuinely will be grateful for every single one of you who gives me advice on this as you helped me in one of my most difficult times:)",

I waited for about 10 seconds and honked at them. \n\nI know it may not sound like an accomplishment to everyone, but it is for me. \n\nOnce, I almost got into a car accident with this one lady. Factually speaking, she caused it. Yet she had the audacity to yell at me like it's my fault. And instead of standing up for myself, I started crying and apologized to her. \n\nI do this all the time. I trust others a lot more than myself. I believe that everything they say and do is \"right\" and I am always \"wrong.\" It could be anything. It's like I'm insecure about everything about myself. The way I talk, the way I think, breathe, eat, everything. There could literally be another person who is just like me in every possible way and I would still value them more. I am unbelievably hypercritical of myself and it makes me miserable. I'm working on it though. I try to trust myself and empathize with myself more. This was just one of the small wins I wanted to share :)",

The sexual predator. The religious idiot. I'm so much better than the billions of primitive warlike superstitious cavemen. I am better than flat Earth Q Anon Trump humpers. I am better, because the way I see it you only have two choices in life. You can have a high self-esteem, or a low one. High self-esteem is what you call narcissism. Low self-esteem is everything else. From my lofty perch in the sky, looking down on all you unwashed mongrels, I made the right decision.\nYou should ask yourself a simple question. Where did narcissism come from? Narcissism is a survival strategy given to us by mother nature and evolution. I have survived hellish experiences on earth and I will continue to overcome all adversity and obstacles and chaos, simply because I believe I am better than you. \nMaybe if the common man in society was not such a shitty creature, just a low energy, low intelligence, proto-human, maybe I would not be so determined to be better than anyone. But when I see the ugliness, and plutonium-dense stupidity of society, hell yes I'm better than all of you.\nThis fundamental belief forces me to behave better than you always. I read books. I workout. I make good money. If I did not do these things I could not say that I am better than you. This belief forces me to do better.

But if a task is too easy, you will get bored easily. A task can’t be too challenging or too easy, somewhere in the middle is where you can enter the flow state.\n2. **Have clear goals** \\- Having clear goals helps you understand what is needed to get done and when complete, you can know that.\n3. **Stop multi-tasking** \\- Despite what is said, multi-tasking does not allow you to be more productive. It does the opposite. When multi-tasking your not doing two things at once, you are forcing your brain to switch between tasks at rapid paste.",

        "text": "Hey everyone. I have noticed this problem throughout my whole life. since primary school and still effects my work life to this day. I have tried therapy for 5+ years, i have tried exposure therapy (experiencing it more) that has helped in a slight regard &amp; more out of anything, at least its not all the time now. medication. slowing things down. so much different stuff but i never seem to shake the problem.... I'm 21 now. everyone still basically says they don't know how to help. I have even tried stoicism and other self help routes \n\n**^(I'M WAY TOO SENSITIVE WHEN DEALING WITH PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WITH MANNERISMS AND TONE OF VOICE!)**\n\nI constantly read people wrong at work. (customer service) and get complaints because i freakout and handle it badly. my parents and random people, when they aren't talking in a obviously nice tone they sound so rude that i could legit run away and start going all silly, its so intense even if they aren't meaning anything wrong its unbearable. I get this adrenaline feeling and i start getting all tight.\n\nas a kid i was so bad, if someone said for a second anything negative or i was going to get in trouble i would start uncontrollably crying &amp; hyperventilating while most kids were chill or shrugged it off. this was when i was 12 btw.\n\nI'm so over being so over sensitive it brings me to the point that i feel like I'm a lost cause. my whole life i have felt like everyone is against me even though my realistic side of the brain knows that's not the case and its so self centred. not that I'm suicidal anymore it has brought me close to that in the past my sensitivity. not to mention the sigma that guys cannot show any emotion or anything showing that your struggling in that kind of way has rained havoc. I got fired from my \"dream\" apprenticeship at 18 because i felt like everyone was always bullying me and giving me a hard time. same as school i left early because i just wanted it to stop but im starting to realise the way i think things are subconsciously is not the case. it so confusing. I have only recently not found the mannerism \"BUDDY\" rude and upsetting as i used to think that was something said in a condescending way and would think everyone thought of me as a pile of dirt as i was working.\n\nI just wish I could not care what people thought of me and didn't let the tones or expression of peoples words get to me so much it literally is ruining my life. only if it was as simple as turning down a dial \n\nTL:DR - I'm way too sensitive when it comes to tone of voice and different mannerisms + negative stimuli, it is literally ruining my life. I constantly read people wrong and its leading to work, social issues. people always sound so negative and rude if it isn't in a okay sounding voice and not a obviously fake one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease any help is appreciated. I'm seriously lost",

Taking a moment to appreciate what's already in my life has quickly made a difference.  \n\n\nWhen I'm feeling stuck, I try to focus on what I'm grateful for. It shifts my mindset from scarcity to abundance, which makes me feel like I can take on the world. Plus, I think it helps me build better relationships with the people around me. When I show my appreciation for their support and help, it makes them feel good - and it just feels good to spread positivity.  \n\n\nSo if you're feeling like you need a productivity boost, try incorporating gratitude into your day. Take a few minutes each day to think about what you're thankful for, and share that gratitude with those around you. You might be surprised at how much it helps!",

I really try hard to grow, I go to therapy, I read all the right books, meditate, and truly have a very friendly personality. \n\nUntil I don’t. \n\nThe thing is, when someone treats me wrong, is mean to me, or disrespects me, I just shut down and become petty or passive aggressive. I feel like sometimes I just mirror the energy someone gives me, even if that means I act petty, immature, or straight up mean. If someone is passive aggressive or rude to me, I will be 1000x more to them. \n\nNow I’m all for standing up for myself, but I take it super personal and let it ruin my mood, even my day sometimes, or my entire relationship with them. \n\nMy therapist mom said it’s a lack of emotional maturity, and at least I’m now aware of it because I wanna change it. I really really want to learn to stop taking things so personal and to be the bigger person, or at least be less reactive. \n\nDoes anyone struggle with that too? and what’s something you’ve done to change that? \n\nTLDR: I let people ruin my mood easily and I turn passive aggressive and petty the second someone isn’t nice to me.",

We broke up and he dated one of my so-called best fiends for 7 months, they got together 2 months after we broke up. \n\nI really thought he was the one and of course now I know he isn’t, but I can’t seem to let it go.

I’m doing therapy, working out, focusing on myself, but it’s still hard. I have so many intrusive thoughts. I’ve been dreaming about him a lot. Not good dreams. Yesterday I dreamed that he wanted to date a 14 yo (he would NEVER) and I was the one in charge of stopping that from happening, but people in my dream just called me a crazy ex.   \n\nHow do I move on from this?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11nenny/my_view_the_bottom/",
        "text": "By: a nobody\n\nStarted on: 3/11/2020\n\nI end all my papers with the expression “I will see you at the top”. This is because reaching “the top” is my goal in life. I want to see everyone there someday. However, In this paper, I want to explain the bottom. The bottom is where I am now, and it is where I will always see myself.\n\nI see humanity in a hierarchy. One with the best of us at the top, and the worst of us at the bottom. This hierarchy is one of value, not of power. In this hierarchy a person’s value stems from kindness, morality, pureness of heart, the desire to do good for this world and having the courage to act on it. Things like money, power, and accomplishments have no value here. The only thing that matters is an individual's determination to be their best self. I view myself at the bottom of this hierarchy, at the bottom of humanity. I am lower than drug addicts. I am lower than killers. I am lower than rapists, terrorists, and dictators. I am the absolute least valuable person of all 7 billion people that live on this Earth. This is where I am meant to be, and this is where I will stay.\n\nI am surrounded by great people. Everyone around me is better than me. I know I am a bad talker, and if I talk the people around me will realize just how low my place is. They will realize how scared I am. They will realize I don’t belong, and they would be right. I do not deserve to be with these people. I am terrified of dragging them down. I am terrified of tainting their greatness. I work hard to stay out of the way, and always take a back seat. Any involvement from me would make everyone else worse. I do everything I can to get by unnoticed and to never be a detriment. I keep my head down, my mouth shut and go to work. I do this with the hopes of tricking the people around me into believing I am equal to them. I hide my weakness behind my work ethic while praying that they will keep me around just a day longer. This illusion of goodness may work on them, but it does not work on me. I know my place, and I will not step out of it.\n\nThis view of myself at the very bottom of humanity is why I know I will reach the top. As long as I choose to place myself at the bottom, I will never feel good enough for the people around me. This feeling of having things I do not deserve is what motivates me. This feeling is the reason I get out of bed every morning. Everyday I try to grow as a person. Everyday I try to get better at something, anything at all. Everyday I try to make myself useful to all the people above me. Everyday I try not to waste the air I breathe. I am alive to serve. I am alive to do the hard shit that no one else wants to do. I dream that someday I will be able to give everyone the life they deserve. I will do all the struggling, I will do all the work, and the good people of this Earth will finally have a chance to rest.\n\nI know that as long as I stay at the bottom, the fire inside of me will never go out. I will strive to get better every single day. I will strive to prove my worth. As long as I am getting better, I will in turn make everyone around me better. I am at the bottom so I can push people to the top with me. I know I will reach the top someday and I try to drag everyone around me up too. I know you can reach the top too. Our minds are the only things stopping us from joining greats. All we need is the courage to fail and stubbornness to fail again. With this we may someday find that we have grown.\n\nI will see you at the top :)\n\nIt is now 2023 and has been a few years since I last looked at this paper. It is crazy to see how times have changed. I know longer see myself in the light that I once used to. I still see myself as a servant, but I no longer feel below other people. I feel as though I have the right to choose who I serve, and that my service is valuable. At the same time I still do not believe I am better than anyone else. We are all one bad decision from becoming the scum of the Earth and one good idea away from becoming a legend. In this aspect we are all equal.\n\nAs far as the great people around me that I talk about in this essay, it now seems that we mutually look up to each other. They have helped me find strength I did not know I had and I have tried to do the same for them. We show each other that we care and always try to bring the best out of one another. I find it interesting that during this time I could recognize that I was surrounded by good people, but at the same time was afraid of their judgment as if they were evil.\n\nAlthough my views have changed I have tried to clarify, without altering, the original message throughout my proofreading and editing process. I think that my mindset at the time of this paper’s creation may be somewhat relatable or interesting to some people. I hope this is helpful, or at least thought provoking, for someone out there. Thank you for reading.\n\nLove you all &lt;3",

Binge eating is one of the few ways I can actually feel ok and all of my coping mechanisms are maladaptive. I feel like I’m nothing to anyone and I can’t stay motivated to fix myself. I feel so alone. Im going to be a lot better off once I go to college next year and am in a whole new environment where I can finally start talking to a therapist, finding friends and maybe a girlfriend. But right now I’m stuck in this toxic environment and I don’t know if it’s even possible for me to change right now.",

        "text": "Yo, listen up! If you're dealing with snoring, one of the main culprits could be your sleeping position. Experts say that snoozing on your back can cause your throat muscles to relax and lead to those dreaded snores. As you drift off, the soft tissues in your throat can collapse and narrow your airway, causing that annoying sound. Plus, if you're overweight, drink alcohol, or smoke, these factors can make snoring even worse, making it hard to catch some quality Z's.\n\nBut don't worry, there are ways to tackle this issue head-on. One straightforward solution is to switch up your sleeping position and try sleeping on your side to keep your airway open and reduce snoring. You could also use a specially designed pillow that helps keep your head and neck in alignment, making it easier to breathe throughout the night.\n\nIn the end, it's all about understanding how your sleeping position can affect your snoring and overall sleep quality. You could use a body pillow to maintain the right position or even sew/tape a tennis ball to the back of your PJs to stop you from rolling onto your back. By taking these steps you could finally ditch the snoring and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to crush the day!",

        "text": "Read a hard book that's going to actually make you feel something. \n\nDon't tackle a 'Book Challenge' where you are going to read a book a week.  But not going tonread anything written past the 8th grade reading level.  And especially don't do it for clout.  \n\nIt's OK to read easy books or 'popular' books you find on tik tok or Instagram (especially if you are getting back into reading) but please do yourself a favor and do the following. \n\n1.) Read a classic.  Bronte, Austen, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Twain, Steinbeck, Kafka, Kurt Vounnegut. They are classics fir a reason (currently reading The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and fucking love it)\n\n2.) Don't read to hit a goal.  Read to learn or get something out of it.  Books were written first to communicate history. Then it was to tell stories were the author framed the world around their personal ethics, values, virtues, and beliefs.  I think there is a lot.less.of that now then there was even 20 years ago.  Though some stuff still shines through. \n\n3.) Don't just read self help/ nonfiction books.  These are easy to read because there isn't a plot it's just a booknof information.  I read Deep Work by Cal Newport and How to Take Smart Notes in a weekend.  It's not difficult.  They are each like 200 something pages of just strategies on how to get stuff done.  Also how many books do you need to read to help yourself?  \n\n4.) Fiction makes you more empathic.  For all of you emotionally deprived people.  It could be because you didn't read enough as kids.  Not a big deal just start reading now.  You've probably got time and are able to read whatever book you want.  \n\n5.) Find your white whale.  Mine currently is 1Q84 by Murakami it's a 928 page brick of a book.  The next is the unconsoled by ishiguro, then the brothers kazmaraov by dostoyevsky. Find those books that you want to read but don't think you can and start chipping away at them.  Whether it be the entirety of the song and ice and fire series.  All of the lord of the rings books or War and Peqce.  Just find that brick that you are scared of and start chipping away at it.\n\n6.) Don't be afraid of genres that are not part of the gender norms.   Dudes read romantic Era novels and Shakespeare tragedies.  Ladies pick up that spy thriller or Sci fi book.  I know we are moving into a much more gender neutral state (for better and worse). And guess what. Dudes women like men who understand romances.  And chick's Dudes dig girls with nerdy passions. Also there are some classics on both sides.\n\nOverall pick up a book from your library, book store, second hand shop (recommend thriftbooks if you live in the states) or e reader platform and read just a bit more.",

I'll try again, but my grades are good enough only to scrape by; At work, one that I've held for 10 months, I keep making stupid mistakes, and I can't focus on it. I'm always forgetting to turn something on, which then leads to spoiled food, or getting overwhelmed by small amounts of orders. To make things worse, I feel like a genuine moron; I remember not being this ridiculously dumb, and I'm not sure when it was that my IQ took a nose dive. \n\nI don't smoke, I drink only occasionally and moderately, I've no vices of any sorts. It's such a shitty feeling to always mess things up, it makes me feel incompetent. Things that are obvious take me an unorderly amount of time to understand, when I know I could do better, or atleast, that's what I believed; With each passing day I lose trust and confidence in myself which only makes me mess up even more while overthinking even the most basic of actions. It feels like my mind is all over the place, while at the same time being completely static, thinking of nothing, only humming a tune once in a while. \n\nAll of this helps shape my perception of myself; I feel as if, even if I get into college, which is unlikely, I'll just flunk out and be forced to drop out do to my inadequacy. I was a completely average student in High School, good enough to pass every class, but not enough to get any good or even \"decent\" grades. Why would I even be able to survive college? I guess I'm writing this to ask advice from anyone who's willing to share it; I'm not in a situation where I can get much of it for free.",

I was overweight for a few years, drank a ton and spent 10 years in the military. But now I’ve stopped drinking, am in the best shape of my life, and am in college with a just little bit of spending money. \n\nSo my question is why do all my friends talk about their 30’s as like the aches and pains days? It’s almost all negative feedback about how everything hurts and it’s all downhill from here. Sure I get a little discomfort now and have to stretch a bit to stay flexible but nothing super bad. Am I just in denial? I’m definitely more physically capable now then I ever was in my 20’s and can see myself staying active as long as I take care of myself. Is 30’s really the “beginning of the end?”",
