        "text": "I recently discovered this puzzle game and found it to be very clever, but the box claims that there are 165,888 possible puzzles, and I just cannot make the math work out. I’m hoping someone else can assist. \n\nEssentially, the puzzle consists of a six-pointed star with 48 numbered triangular spaces, seven of which will be blocked for each game. This blocking is what makes each game different, and is determined by a dice roll. There are three 8-sided dice and four 6-sided dice, and each number 1-48 appears only once. \n\nTo my way of thinking, the number of dice combinations possible is 8 * 8 * 8 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6, which equals 663,552. Since this board is a six-pointed star, however, that means that there are six possible number combinations that will result in the same puzzle configuration if we disregard orientation. If we divide 663,552 by 6 we get 110,592.\n\nI can see a case being made that there are either 663,552 possible puzzles (the more impressive marketing-oriented number) or 110,592 possible puzzles (the more accurate number.) I can’t, however, see how they got to the claim of 165,888 on the box. \n\nWhat am I missing here? Anyone got ideas?",

Here at my university I was talking to someone in their 3rd year who was barely passing intro real analysis, meanwhile they have 1st years take it in Europe. \n\nFor a while I was thinking it might have been because of a stellar pre-college education, but then I remembered taking the oxford math admissions test for fun in 12th grade and finding it to be really easy. So I'm confused what the hell is happening to these undergraduates to make them so good at math.",

I have been a TA in math courses and also help my friends with math questions and really enjoy it. But the thing is I'm not perfect in math. Like I can do questions etc correctly \"by just yk following the method/formulas and using some concepts\" but I don't think I have strong understanding of \"why\" we do what we do. Which makes me think I'm horrible at math and shouldn't do MS in it. \n\nOn the other hand I have econ. Oh I forgot to mention I'm majoring in Economics and math. I love researching and would love to answer different questions/problems and maybe help others but again I'm not too good at econ either. For each course I understand stuff but forget everything once I move onto next semester. I would like to teach math more than teaching econ one day. But I'm afraid. What if I fail at teaching? \n\nI still dk if I should major in math or econ. I like math but what if I'm unable to do higher advanced math? Because I focus on the way we do math rather than why we do.\n\n\nAlso, I don't want to take a gap year/or join corporate world to think what I want to do. \n\n\nCould anyone please guide me? What should I do? I still have time to change my senior year project from econ to math. I don't want to regret ny decision later on. \n\nI'm extremely confused. Any guidance will be appreciated. Thank you. \n\nAlso, I have a gpa of around 3.7: 3.67ish in econ and 3.67ish math (cgpa in both econ and math are the same too. They don't help me decide either ;-;)",

        "text": "If the title is a little confusing, here’s what I mean. \n\nI’m currently taking Real Analysis, and of course we’ve covered a lot of axioms. This has made me wonder what exactly the nature of an axiom is.\n\nFor example, take the Completeness Axiom. My understanding is that mathematicians don’t just take this as an axiom because they’ve taken a bunch of examples or subset of the reals that have upper bounds and been like, “Yep! This one obeys the axiom too, so this is axiom is probably true”. \n\nRather the axiom is definitional. That is to say: The axiom is taken to be true because it is true, and we define it to be true explicitly by the way we define the real numbers. We specifically define real numbers in such a way to ensure that every subset which is bounded will have a supremum.\n\nIs my understanding off base here? I’d love anymore insight into my question.

Is the goal of 3 Coloring problem to demonstrate only one of the possible unique 3 Colorings of a particular graph in polynomial time or is the goal to find ALL possible solutions in polynomial time?\n\nBasically, is the goal to find one unique solution or ALL solutions in polynomial time.

Now, if you times this number by 81 you get 1,679,616. This number happens to have exactly 81 divisors and can be rooted down three times down to 6 (1,679,616 -&gt; 1296 -&gt; 36 -&gt; 6).\n\nBy the way, if you multiply 20,736 by 256 instead, you get 5,308,416, which can be rooted down twice to 48.\n\nI guess my question is multipart:\n\n1) Is this discovery already known? I think it's interesting, but maybe that's subjective.\n\n2) Does the fact that 1,679,616 has exactly 81 factors just a coincidence?\n\n3) Is this a unique quality? Could doing this with other successive seed square numbers (regardless of whether their totals equals a new square number) result in a divisor count shown above?\n\n4) Is there an algorithm or list that can find all the numbers that have *n* number of factors up until an arbitrary point? For example, I know there are 30 divors of 1,200, with 30 being one of them, so 30 x 40 would satisfy this. Interestingly, 30 x 40 is similar to the 3 x 4 from the original question. I'm curious to see how many numbers there are and if there are any patterns.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I guarantee that if you have worked as a casual at any university then you have had your time stolen. You've been a victim of wage theft. \n\n&gt; High rates of casualisation in tertiary education drive wage theft.\n\n&gt; Two thirds of all staff at Australian universities are employed insecurely through casual or fixed-term arrangements even though most of the work they perform is needed on an ongoing basis.\n\nI've personally experienced this both as a casual and when on a fixed-term contract.\n\nThe university of Melbourne is now completely revaluating its reliance on casual staff.\n\n&gt; A University of Melbourne spokesperson said the university was working to reduce its reliance on casual employment, to rethink its workforce model and to improve employment and management practices, including creating compliance-focused roles, designing a new scheduling model, working to identify practices that are inconsistent with its obligations and setting up a wage remediation program. (https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/staggering-victorian-universities-underpaid-workers-by-50m-in-three-years-report-says-20230217-p5clfn.html)\n\nThe cynic in me assumes that this is code for \"increase administrative load on academic staff so that we can say we're doing the right thing\"... but who knows maybe they'll actual start paying for the time they need.\n\nWhen I was employed as a casual tutor and had to do marking, I was allocated 2 minutes per assignment. Basically I only marked for obvious errors. Naturally students with difficult to read hand writing suffered. This wasn't / still isn't fair to students nor was it to students.\n\n&gt; This report exposes what we’ve known for some time - systemic wage theft has been baked into universities’ business models. The sheer scale of wage theft in higher education is staggering. It’s absolutely shameful that so many Australian university staff have had wages stolen - Dr Alison Barnes head of the National Tertiary Education Union (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/20/australia-news-live-wage-theft-education-economy-voice-robodebt-interest-rates-housing-health?page=with:block-63f2cc228f08bb2550a9b4de#block-63f2cc228f08bb2550a9b4de).\n\nHave you ever felt like the bureaucracy is using you like a disposable cog? Abusing your need for money and inability to work easily work elsewhere / \"passion for math\"? Yeah. Really sorry about that. The system chewed me up and spat me out - like so many others. \n\nMaths is on the edge of the fight in Australia. It's useful in application but as a subject in its own right its funded more like an art than a science. Uni's over here are cutting art programs. Not because they're not profitable - but because they are not profitable enough. The same thought process will eventually be applied to Math departments. Many departments here are trying to prevent themselves from being split as \"stats\" vs \"math\". The stats people make money... the maths people do not. ANU, the top uni in Australia, already operates like this.\n\nThis wage theft issue is a symptom of the same rot.",

        "text": "I found an interesting book recently called A Diary on Information Theory by Alfred Renyi. The first chapter is an introduction to information theory (which I don't have prior experience with, but found interesting), and is written from the perspective of a student taking a course in information theory, detailing that student's questions and discoveries along the way. I enjoyed reading it, and, embarrassingly, actually believed the author was a real student, at least for a while. It simulates the way an idealized student would slowly learn the topic, question the material, and come to realize the deeper content that the instructor was (temporarily) hiding in each lecture, to be revealed later. It also has some philosophizing on information and teaching.\n\nI was wondering what other interestingly written math papers or books there are. This is a broad topic, but I was particularly interested in material that is creatively written, while still containing theory.\n\nOther worthwhile mentions are:\n\n*The Part-Time Parliament by Leslie Lamport. Computer Science, rather than math, but I think it fits. Lamport pretends to write about a legislative process on a Greek island, while actually introducing a consensus protocol. According to Lamport, a lot of people didn't understand what the paper was about because they got confused by the narrative.\n*Who killed the Duke of Densmore? by Claude Berge. A Sherlock Holmes story where Holmes solves a murder using the theory of interval graphs. I can't find the original story, but I've seen versions of it online. The original is probably in French.\n*Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott. I'm sure many people here have heard of it, but it still bears mentioning. It's not exactly theory, but I do think you would learn about mathematics, or how to think about mathematics, by reading it.",

If one happens, so will the other.\n\nSurely the correct probabilities are P(SB is woken on Monday and Heads) = 1/2, P(SB is woken on Monday and Tails) = 1/2, P(SB is woken on Tuesday and Tails) = 1/2.",
