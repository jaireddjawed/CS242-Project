I'm talking the classics like The Wire, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc. But also plenty of recent examples: Succession, Severance, Andor, The Last of Us\n\nThe only term that is coming to my mind is \"Premier TV\", but if I search for that now I don't get any usage of it, and just another streaming platform.\n\nWhat term is it that's slipping my mind?\nThanks",

Yellowstone comes off like it was written by the most libertarian, bordering white nationalist, Facebook conspiracy obsessed piss-baby elder Gen X’er still clinging to the notion of American exceptionalism. Nuance? Not a trace. The ultra rich white antagonist is unilaterally in the right. Natives want their ancestral land back to make a casino and infuse money to their destitute community? Nope, old whitey needs to make sure he has THE biggest ranch in the US because he’s the most special American to ever own land. Their family unjustly seized land others were living on but when a business wants to seize their land, that’s cause for violent action. A smarter writer could actually play with that irony but this show’s writer seems like the type to believe in flat earth because he’s “never seen the curvature”. They pretty quickly transitioned to only white antagonists hopefully bc someone recognized the ignorant insanity of casting Natives as the bad guys in the 21st century. The incessant straw man attacks against “wokeness” that get hyper edited into Reels and YouTube shorts border on parody but you know they’re genuine because Taylor Sheridan looks like a cop that would turn his body cam off. When Ben Shapiro has a dedicated series reviewing each episode of your show, that’s your cue to explore some new themes.",

I know a lot of these clues would lead you to believe I'm talking about Grey's Anatomy. I reassure you I am not.\n\nThe show might have been an hour long drama. The only episode that stand's out to me is when the nurses/nursing students are gathered around talking to a male nurse, who explains he grew up in a home full of many sisters, and that he was gay. I keep thinking about the show because it feels like it might have been a strong influence on what became Grey's Anatomy.",

It was true however.\n\nApatow made a lot of films where the females were the boring shrews to the more entertaining makes. Think Superbad, Knocked Up and 40 year old Virgin as a few examples. He needed a way to prove he was not sexist. So he comes across Lena Dunham 's film. She is his neighbour from Brooklyn gentified and a family friend. Boom. He go OES to be HBO to who are also having problems due to the Sexual violence in Game of Thrones.\n\nGirls was Judd Apatow's chance to show a Hollywood he was not sexist without having to do the hard work.",

Shonda Rhimes betreated Isiah with kid gloves after what he did.\n\nShe had to fire him after TR came out on Ellen. Afterwards she punished TR and Katherine ruining both their characters through the writing. Even having them hook up. My guess that it was a passive aggressive way of hurting the actors. Heigl got upset and went out criticise the direction. Not smart but still understandable",

Manifest was supposed to be the ideal example of a network show that blew up on Netflix, and on top of that actually released a new seaeson on Netflix last year - and New Amsterdam is blowing its doors down (I'm sure Netflix really wishes they took over NA to release new seasons like Manifest).\n\nI think the low competition the first few months of the year had something to do with it, but still.",
