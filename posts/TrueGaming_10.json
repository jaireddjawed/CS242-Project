        "text": "The argument is that Rogue Likes (I'm going to call them Rogue Lite) is an umbrella term. Dead cells is a 2d action/platform game and in terms of gameplay closer to Castlevania than compared to Issac which is a bullet hell. Risk of Rain 2 is a shooter and FTL is just a strategy game.\nThey should focus more on their actual genre, like Everspace that became a linear game in its sequel. (Looting based game now). Risk of Rain 2 would have actual level design and a balanced enemy variety for example, if it were similar. With that argument, the Rogue Like genre is a handicap to those games. True enjoyment comes from its main gameplay  \n\nThe negatives of Rogue Lites are they're daunting to start with. Normally, it's difficult in the beginning, and you don't progress much. And Replay fatigue comes fast. This could be a negative for Rogue Lites that rely on exploration in late game(Noita).\nIn some games, you don't like the core gameplay enough thanks to perma death removing all your progress. And making the hours spent on the game much longer\n\n I think the actual popular Rogue Lites right now wouldn't benefit. Rogue Lite is a decision the devs made consciously, normally. The devs want to make a rogue like. And there are several reasons why Indie developers create them:\n-Diversity of weapons/ability\n-Player can make options that have impact on the game\n-Relying on skill and learning enemy behavior is the focus\n-The Generated Situations are Meaningfully Different (most of the time)\nSlay the spire wouldn't work as a linear game or would be over in very short time. Dead Cells would inherently be a totally different game since the base combat is not as deep as any 2d action game. Most of its complexity comes from its Rogue Like elements. \n\n\n\nReasons why some Rogue Lites would benefit from being linear exist too. Perma death is inherent no popular for the masses. Losing progress is a big fear many people have. You can create specific scenarios that every player going to replicate on each play through. It's easier to guide the player how they're going to enjoy the game. And story is far easier on a linear game. Hades is truly an exception. Contradicting to Dead cells, Bindaac of Issac who uses lore or Slay the spire that doesn't even have a story.\nI am going to say there exist some Rogue Lites where I don't like its random nature or its badly balanced. Mothergunship is an FPS Shooter that relies on Weapon upgrades that are randomized. And it has a huge issue for overbalancing those weapons. There is meter that limits on how much you can shoot at any given moment. Making broken builds like in Risk of Rain 2 impossible. Without getting powerful, there is little to no reason to play that game, since the charm comes from the weapon upgrading.\n\nNow to my opinion. A bad Rogue Lite that has a problem with its random nature or bad balance can be fixed in two ways. Making some game linear is absolutely possible. But if the devs aren't willing to change genre, we should focus on the actual inherent Problems of that game \nMothergunship could be a linear game. Would it fix everything? I do think that would be the case, since the balance philosophy would be different (and the enemies are bland). But the game can be made fun as a Rogue Lite again too. By removing that meter and make broken builds viable. \n\n\n\nAnd this is also difficult since people who inherently don't like the genre and people who like the genre have different opinions on it. \nI think bad Rogue Lites make more sense to discuss if they benefit from being a different genre. But discussing already popular games needing to change genre is like discussing that Final Fantasy 14 should be a Single-player offline experience instead. It has an established Fanbase and the Devs succeeded to share their vision with others. For me, Rogue Lites don't have an inherent flaw.\nIt's just how you implement the genre where my criticism may come",

Steam reviews are usually people who loved the game before and are like “strike the earth” with a play time of 2 hours on Steam.\n\n\nBut the Steam version of DF as of right now, is simply not as good as Rimworld in almost any way. \n\n\nTake a look at some of the things like; \n\n\nGraphics: while you might enjoy how DF looks, from a technical standpoint this isn’t even a contest. RW has graphics while DF is a slideshow.\n\n\nGameplay: DF is simply less intuitive. You spend time trying to figure out how to do simple things, which is not a good sign for gameplay. Logs and menus are still lackluster. Some logs disappear, like combat. \n\n\n\nCombat: DF relies on generating logs, instead of RW’s actual combat system. Those logs then disappear. Prisoner system way more fleshed out in RW. \n\n\nTaming animals: Way more animals and way more use for them.\n\n\n\nCrafting/building: Way less content in DF, handful of workshops and no technology. Less meaningful materials, what you make armor or furniture/construction out of doesn’t matter. Any wall will hold back lava, any armor will seemingly protect the same.\n\n\n\nMore could be said about most of them, but you get the idea. I find it interesting it is not mentioned much after putting in some time in DF.",

        "text": "I have looked at people making arguments about Half Life 2's impact on the industry but I personally don't see it as a game that broke new ground. My primary complaint is that the game never got the core FPS aspects right. An FPS has to first and foremost deliver the best shooter experience, which eventually boils down to generalized AI models and enemy variety, so that you get to experience dynamically branching scenarios with potentially infinte variety. Its the kind of challenge that I tend to appreciate because its supposed to be fair and theres an organic learning curve involved.\n\nCompared to games released in the same era like Halo or F.E.A.R., combat in HL2 is mediocre. I dont remember a single encounter in HL2 where combat was unscripted. Most scenarios followed a specific formula\n\n1) the player hits some invisible trigger  \n2) hostile NPC's are either spawned or telepathically alerted  \n3) NPC's always know the player's location even if they never saw them  \n4) no concept of target acquisition whatsoever, because the NPCs always know your location\n\nPossibly the dumbest AI framework for a game that was preceeded by Halo, Far Cry and closely followed by F.E.A.R. where you actually had a proper functioning AI, subjected symmetrically to the same set of rules, as applied to players. This led to encounters in HL2 being too tightly scripted and lacking any kind of replay value because it lacked the dynamism of other games. Since combat constitutes 80% of FPS' proposition, there's not much that can be done to elevate the game through excellence in other areas, but here too I don't find any breakthrough achievement that could afford ratings in range of 9-10/10.\n\nLet's look at physics, supposed to be another big draw. Yes they did some cool stuff with physics but they were'nt able to integrate all that coolness in gameplay. So they had to resort to specially scripted levels like Ravenholm, or some odd encounters where a combine team conveniently stands on an explosives laden bridge and cheap stuff like artifically constraining player choice. I had the pleasure of playing Silent Storm, another game released before HL2 that goes big on physics but was bang-on with its implementation as a core gameplay feature instead of a sideshow. Silent Storm however isn't an FPS but still an ideal case study on how to incorporate physics in gameplay. Physics was supposed to be just a gimmick in HL2, given that high energy projectiles could'nt penetrate through doors or thin metal signages thrust upon you in another one of those specifically scripted sniper levels.\n\nVehicles again, Far Cry (or even Halo) did a much better job and HL2 probably just thought about including vehicles because other FPS titles were also doing it. Hl2 is an enigma of sorts for me, because I am unable to explain away its ratings thorugh cold-blooded analysis, maybe it was just leveraging the HL brand or perhaps I overlooked other factors that cntribute towards it perfect score.

        "text": "In the past I've played every Souls game released, and enjoyed them all to various degrees. In general, I would've considered myself a big fan of the combat formula. Earlier this year, I picked up Elden Ring when it came out, and just found myself... exhausted. By the time you get to lategame in ER, the bosses kill you in 1-2 mistakes, they do strings that last for 12 seconds before giving you the mercy of a short window to get in one or two attacks yourself, just to repeat the process over again. They hold their weapon in the air for 5 seconds just begging you to mess up a single roll, they instantly move to your location if you even try to make distance, they have a frame-perfect reaction if you try a ranged attack or a heal far away. \n\nWhile I did finish the game and took on many of the side bosses, I couldn't help but feel FromSoftware was trying to live up to their reputation in the worst way possible- they focused more on making the boss take you at least 5-10 tries (if not many more) than they did make any part of it interesting. There's no creativity in taking on most of ER's bosses- they have such set windows to land damage on them that almost every boss comes down to learn the precise timing to i-frame through each attack, and almost nothing more. \n\nIt's not terribly surprising that we landed here- anyone that played DS3 and Sekiro could see this style of enemy design gestating. Elden Ring is just the natural outcome of where FromSoft's direction has been headed for a few games now. But, this style of combat has permeated the gaming world in general at this point, and it feels like there's no fully escaping it. \n\nI've been playing Tunic recently and really enjoying the puzzle-solving and exploration. I've heard the game took quite a while to develop and it shows, everything about it feels really tightly designed... except the combat. To be clear, the combat isn't *bad*- it just feels incredibly redundant at this point. I just finished fighting a lategame boss (&gt;!Scavenger Boss!&lt;), and I just groaned after fighting it the first time. I could tell, it would take me a few tries to learn the timing to i-frame through attacks, then I would have an attempt where I perfectly roll through nearly every attack and win, and that's exactly what happened. I feel like I've done it a thousand times at this point. \n\nThere are plenty of other examples- the i-frame dodge roll is nearly ubiquitous at this point- but Tunic just happened to be the most recent one on my mind. While I do think this style of combat is good (I specifically love Bloodborne's implementation, for a variety of reasons), it feels derivative and repetitive at this point, and attempts by FromSoft themselves to freshen the formula have only emphasized the worst parts, leaving me to question if there's still value to be had from continuing to rehash it over and over.",

        "text": "One of the most important aspects of a game to me is its soundtrack. No moment, no matter the medium, is the same if it does not have a song that matches the mood and atmosphere of whatever it is that it wants to transmit.   \n\n\nOld videogames were limited in what they could transmit to the player, be it in graphics or gameplay, due to technical limitations of the time so artists and developers compensated for it by setting the mood with a beautiful and well crafted soundtrack. Nowadays, this certain aspect of gaming has been lost since the focus has shifted to other things, mainly graphics.   \n\n\nI feel this has damaged the soul of videogames in general. We still have modern games with beautiful and amazing soundtracks, games like Hades, Elden Ring, The Witcher 3 (in my opinion the greatest OST in a videogame ever) but mostly it's just generic and bland soundtracks.  \n\n\nEvery moment in videogames that is vividly remembered by gamers had an amazing song playing in the background. Take an old school jRPG like Final Fantasy VII or Chrono Trigger, the soundtrack of both games highly elevates them to heights that they would not achieve otherwise. If you gave those games better graphics and / or better gameplay but worsening the OST, the game's quality and fondness that the players have torwards it would drop dramatically. I can give you one example, Final Fantasy VIII on PS1 vs PC. The PC version can look cleaner than the PS1 version, even at the time, but almost everyone universally agrees that the PS1 version is the best option of the 2 simply for the fact that when they ported the game to PC they butchered the soundtrack. Look up on youtube the difference between Balamb Garden on PC and on PS1.  \n\n\nFriends of mine don't agree with me on this but for every experience I've had in videogames, the games I remember most fondly are games that had amazing soundtracks. Sonic Adventure, Planescape Torment, Jet Set Radio, the Chrono games, the PS1 Final Fantasy games, Oblivion / Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Fallout 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 etc etc.   \n\n\nIs soundtrack this important to anyone else?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zq0j37/some_thoughts_on_the_design_shift_from_roguelike/",
        "text": "There's one thing I've been lamenting for a while now in the roguelites I've played. Which probably started all the way back with The Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy. It's the shift from immensely frontloaded content/complexity in favor of gradually increasing content via unlocks.  \nEven in my mid teens when I first found roguelikes as a genre at all. Years before either game. I was already sick of needing to grind or unlock content.  \n\nThere was a certain freshness and freedom to just having *everything* from the start. Every game just slapped you in the face with a dozen races and even more classes. Options galore to try something new every death. I think it's a shame the genre moved away from the everything including the kitchen sink mentality. And it's something I don't quite understand or agree with because of it.  \n\nWhether it's pity progression or achievment unlocks for more content. It feels tedious and frankly a bit boring to \"not be allowed the fun stuff\" until you've died a whole bunch of times. Not even considering games which add permanent progression and power in subsequent runs. The pure enjoyment of choice has been largely removed. Both in character creation and what you can do inside of a run without unlocking more gear.  \n\nIs this shift from I guess intrinsic to extrinsic rewards for playing the game something people in here have been thinking about as well? I've seen plenty of people having the exact opposite opinion from me. That losing a run and *not* progressing at all is a waste of time. Giving the player a shiny trinket means it wasn't all for naught. While I would rather have all the shiny trinkets and let myself decide if I want to be a warrior or mage, ghost or ogre right from the start. With all the gameplay implications of either choice as the anti-tedium mix up for the next run to feel fresh no matter what. \n\nI don't necessarily think the old style of frontloading is incompatible with some of the quality of life changes in roguelites either. The rather recent [Rift Wizard](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1271280/Rift_Wizard/) is a great example which combines both.  \nYour build is free form and every spell, skill and upgrade to them is allowed from the start. At the same time the gameplay incorporates anti rng features such as choosing from rooms similar to Hades. With the added benefit you get to see exactly what is in them. The layout, every enemy, item and buff shrine. Every room is its own self contained challenge you must kill and overcome as in most roguelites. This level of planning ahead does in no way make the game easy. Just less likely to be completely torn apart by a bad room roll. It feels much more like a classic roguelike, with a heavy coating of roguelite philosophy without compromising on what drew me into the genre in the first place. \n\nSo what are your thoughts? Do you prefer the game to reward you with items in game or is getting further ahead just fine? Does adding items and systems over time make the games that much easier to get into, or is it unnecessary carrot fluff etc?",

And it's not making any sense to spend all that money when it will be released to PC in 2-3 years.\n\nConsoles in general have been having less and less games and it's becoming that the only reason you should buy one is that you can't afford a desktop with somewhat similar performance.\n\nLike I no longer see the point of having a console. There is an argument to be made for the switch but the ps/xbox no longer make sense if you already have a capable PC. \n\nAm I right? Is there something I'm not seeing?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zp8fww/cyberpunk_2077_is_bad_cyberpunk_because_it_is/",
        "text": "I'm a long-time fan of CDPR games, and I'll be the first person to agree that their games are janky gameplay-wise. But I'll also say that as far as I'm concerned, you don't play CDPR games for the awesome gameplay in my opinion, but the stories - even if the Witcher games are a bad adaptation of the original, with their superficial Slavicization of Western fantasy and completely ignoring some of the core elements of Sapkowski's writing. To clarify, he absolutely hated copying Western fantasy tropes, only slapping on a couple Slavic names to make it seem genuinely Eastern. His series was deliberately post-apocalyptic, to allow for freely mixing modernity, futurism, and fantasy; it was not \"Battle of Agincourt, but with Magic\", but \"Fall Barbarossa, except Fantasy\".\n\nThis is not something noticeable to Western audiences, who typically won't be familiar with the saga. However, CDPR's loose adaptation of the Witcher is important to my point about CP2077.\n\nDisclaimer: I genuinely like the game. It's a power fantasy like most games in the genre, and in that it excels. However, there's a realization that I had when I first saw the previews, and later confirmed when playing the game.\n\nIt's simple: **Cyberpunk 2077 is a cyberpunk game from the 1980s.** \n\nBack then, alongside the likes of Blade Runner, Neuromancer, or the very first Cyberpunk 2013, it would have been a revolutionary story and setting. However, it is now 2022, forty years on, and what was fresh back then has grown exceedingly stale for a simple reason: Everything cyberpunk fiction tried to warn us about has come to pass.\n\nSeriously.\n\nEnvironmental collapse? We're literally living through the climate crisis, with historic rivers drying up and heat waves melting asphalt.\n\nWealth inequality? We experience it every day, and the spectacular rise in inequality since 1989, supercharged by the global spread of unrestrained capitalism, is exactly what cyberpunk predicted. \n\nOligarchs and their megacorps operating above the laws and rules of society? Take your pick: Bezos, Musk, Buffet, Putin, people so detached from the human experience common to billions it's impossible for them to even empathize with us.\n\nCorporate greed literally destroying the world and society? Anyone who wasn't in a coma for the past thirty years is bound to notice the constant shambling from financial crisis to financial crisis, environmental devastation, and unstable societies, complete with a resurgence of fascism, as always when capitalism is in crisis. \n\nConsumerism used to distract millions from the problems of their reality, in BNW fashion? We all have social media accounts pushing us to consume more and more. \n\nThe list goes on, but my point is: **Cyberpunk 2077 represents a failure of imagination.** \n\nIt's made by a Polish studio and predominantly Polish developers. As a Polish person living in Poland, I can honestly see how that works. It's exceedingly difficult to create something subversive and transgressive when you live in a country that's largely an ethnic, cultural, and religious monolith, and where right-wing politics are the default to the point you can have sitting members of Parliament argue for flogging gay people publicly and nobody really bats an eye - because we are so cynical and downtrodden, nobody really believes in either democracy or human values. \n\nThat said, it's ironically very accurate to the core rules:\n\n1. Style over substance: The game is a gorgeously-looking piece of work that honestly doesn't have much to say, as per the above. All of the points it raises have been raised by Cyberpunk 2013/2020 and reflect the anxieties of the 1980s - anxieties that were proven true. It tries to be political, but in doing so demonstrates an archaic worldview that would have been new to our parents, not us (speaking as a 1988 kid). \n\n2. Attitude is everything: Sex! Preem drugs! Violence! Nova swear words! All of these things are in, so we are an Adult Game!\n\n3. Always take it to the Edge: Or Edgy. The sex/drug/general-vice ads running ad nauseam everywhere are just grating. Not in a \"oh, woe is this hypersexualized society\" or \"this is so desensitizing\" fashion, but they just feel juvenile. Especially since 40 years on from the 80s, the predominant trends in marketing are towards respectability and aspiration, not base desires (another spot where CP2077 feels outdated).\n\n4. Break the rules: Or more specifically, the cardinal rule that sci-fi/cyberpunk reflect contemporary anxieties - contemporary to them, not the material they adapt. \n\nI suspect that a good chunk of it is because writers couldn't really put themselves in the shoes of the people they created. Johnny Silverhand is the posterboy here. He's supposed to be the modern-day Lenin waging uncompromising war against corps, and falls flat no matter how hard Keanu Reeves tries to make him work. Take his pitch, which for some reason he only makes once, and even calls attention to that. Why does he want to destroy Arasaka? He's waging a \"people's war against a system that spiraled out of control\". And before you assume he means capitalism and the social and political superstructure built on it, he clarifies it's the \"forces of entropy\". \n\nNot the economic system that makes their power possible in the first place, not the corrupt political system that favors the rich. He nuked the Arasaka HQ because corporations are \"stealing souls\" and represent the \"forces of entropy\". And with the Relic we can safely assume he means it in the literal sense, not the figurative one.\n\nThat's a bigger issue in my view: The setting isn't really trying to be relatable. Corporate enslavement is played off as a joke (haha, the corps are reducing the mandatory work week to just sixty hours!), rather than a horror, and in a fashion that is so over-the-top that it makes it feel like a bad comedy, rather than a game trying to make a serious point. Imagine that it would instead interrogate the \"capitalism with a human face\" angle our corps are playing right now (mindfulness booths at Amazon gulags come to mind, or slave-driving practices of Musk), or the way megacorps use the media to influence us and the struggle against that (come on, you literally have a Media class in the setting and the rise of influencers is validating the basic idea!), or even the tried-and-true corporate violence against the workers (we literally had Pinkertons infiltrating Amazon warehouses in Poland to union bust). \n\nBut no. It's all jokes and tropes we've seen before, things we are comfortable with because we already live in cyberpunk. \n\nNow, compare this with Shadowrun: Dragonfall. In my opinion, it's a far better cyberpunk game, even if I'm not fond of its mechanics or sometimes limited flexibility in playing through missions. In the setting, Berlin is host to megacorps as well but tries to explore the concept in a more serious fashion. My go-to example is the mention of Aztech \"efficiency apartments\" that ensure the commute from bed to desk takes less than ten minutes. It's something that causes horror even among your runners, and Dietrich specifically calls it out as not living but slowly dying.\n\nDo you know what I like about this example? It's relatable. It's understandable. \n\nIt's something we are all familiar with, either directly or by proxy: The drive to maximize profits by driving our humanity down the drain until we're all drones generating income for the powers that be. Worse yet, drones which automatically self-optimize to eliminate any inefficiencies, feeling guilt for not devoting our every waking moment to generating money.\n\nI think that the difference is that Dragonfall isn't fundamentally cynical. You have a lot of cynical characters and viewpoints presented, but these are just that, viewpoints, not absolute truths. \n\nCyberpunk 2077 is extremely cynical, perhaps as a result of its Eastern European pedigree, where cynicism is the cultural default and believing in something makes you a sucker at best, and a fanatic at worst. The most grating part is Johnny's useless ranting against democracy and politics. \n\nHis attitude (haha, all politicians are corrupt, and you're a loser for even thinking about participating) is neither revolutionary nor groundbreaking, it's just the sort of apathy that's incredibly common in Poland. The worst part is that its also a tacit endorsement of conformity and autocracy, the very things we get told Johnny fought against. So he's against corps, but at the same time he's not against the system that created them, he's against autocrats, but hates democracy, oh, and before you assume he's for grassroots democracy and self-organization, he hates those too. \n\nNote how little attention the game plays to the self-organization, to social structures that emerge in the void of governance - they're all lumped together as gangs. The closest you get to an exploration is with megabuilding dwellers asking a random Tyger to fix what the administration cannot/will not, but... That's really all there is to it.\n\nHonestly, 90 hours in and I can barely tell what the gangs stand for, how they function, how they fit into the social structure of the city. For example,  why would anyone join Maelstrom? Deus Ex Invisible War, for all its faults, provided an explanation and understandable motivation for the Omar, the hive-mind cyborgs. Here, Maelstrom is just a body-horror, mechafreak gang to shoot. Tyger Claws and 6th Street are barely better, being just Neon Japanese gangers and Team America: Nightcity Police. I'm probably forgetting some gang or two, but... They're that forgettable, largely due to a lack of redeeming qualities.\n\nHell, even the Nomads aren't given much of an explanation! Aldecaldos get some characterization thanks to Panam, but it stands out because the rest of the groups are so barebones. Look at Saul's plans: He has a reasonable point, many, even, but it's never really explored. Panam is the default option, without an explanation why (aside from vague references to losing your soul working for Biotechnica). \n\nHonestly, I'm not asking for a game version of Das Kapital or Conquest of Bread, but I would like something that's a little thought-provoking. Compared to the much lower budget Citizen Sleeper or Tonight We Riot, Cyberpunk is a story full of fury and thunder that ultimately signifies nothing. \n\nit'sOr worse, it betrays the very essence of cyberpunk with branded Sprite cans used for promoting the game.",

I'll probably make similar posts on other subreddits I'm part of, but I simply just want to try and spread some christmas cheer (if you don't celebrate this particular time of year, for whatever reason, or do so in your own way then I'm still wishing you well anyway). \n\nI've seen some wonderful discussions on here over time, people respecting the opinions of others whilst giving their own too. It lends for a healthier environment for all and it's fantastic to see, it also means you may come away with some new knowledge or an insight on something you didn't have before. \n\nIn regard to Christmas and games, I often find this time of year can have people discussing games that are in some way linked to Christmas (which are their favourite, what it means to them, etc) but also ones that aren't necessarily Christmas games per se, but ones they play at this time of year (a personal choice of mine is the Borderlands series). This has already taken place on the sub many times - though if you've not yet given your own two cents, by all means feel free to. \n\nWith that in mind, I'm not neccesarily trying to rehash previous posts, but I simply want to thank those who have discussions here and are civil about it too, whether about Christmas related things (simply because it's that time of year in which I'm posting this) or just games in general. It's heart-warming and, as I say, has often led to me looking at things with a different perspective. \n\nAnyhow, whatever your favourite Christmas game, or simply game to play at Christmas, enjoy it for whatever reason you do. \n\nAll the best, everyone.

        "text": "This has been a pet peeve of mine for a while, but my brief encounter with the recent Rick-and-Morty-em-up High on Life brought that issue once again in sharp focus. Might as well use it as an example. See, HoL has these semi-open, moderately sized locations, as well as a steady progression of metroidvania-esque traversal abilities. There are also loads of optional treasure chests that are often hidden behind some light platforming and/or environmental puzzles. It's good stuff, or it would be, if the \"treasure\" wasn't just a bit of cash. The same cash that falls out of enemies as you slaughter them by the zillions. And it's not like you can even buy much with that cash - there's an upgrade shop, but a good chunk of the available upgrades is incremental stuff like \"faster reload\" or \"slightly more health\".\n\nAnd you could say, sure, but that's a mediocre at best first-day-on-GamePass shooter, what exactly do you expect? Well, let me give you another example, an itty-bitty little exploration game called Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Yeah. We're going there. BotW is all about the lure of the unknown, climbing that mountain, diving into that ravine, reaching that alien-looking, ominously symmetrical maze island. Why is it there? What am I going to find? I can answer that one for you, kiddo. No matter how elaborate the environmental puzzle, how cool the location, how riveting the mini-boss fight, what you're gonna find, is a shrine. With the same cutscene at the end and a quarter of a heart container. That's it.\n\nOi, matey, I hear you say in an inexplicable Peaky Blinders accent, hands off Zelda. It's a storied franchise with its own, much beloved way of doing things. Okay, okay. Here's yet another example, again, from a very different game. Remedy's Control. A beautiful, haunting, exhilarating experience, not at all a rip-off of the SCP Foundation. No siree. And the best part is, you get to explore this impossible structure that exists outside space, time and sanity, The Oldest House, a place filled with all kinds of horrors and eldritch secrets. Now, what do I get if I utilize my levitation powers to their full potential, defy the semi-sentient geometry of this place and reach this or that secret little alcove? Oooh, a chest! I wonder, what juicy tidbit is in there. Oh. Oh. It's a fucking randomly generated upgrade that grants me 18 percent of extra damage when firing upside down under the pale moonlight on the 30th of February of every other year. That I can't even pick up because my inventory is overflowing with that junk already and there's no \"destroy useless shit in bulk\" option, because, if there was, it would probably delete half of the game.\n\nSigh. Okay. By now you probably just want to scream \"What do you want?!\" at me, like Ryan Gosling in The Notebook. Well, I can tell you exactly what I want. I want Fallout New Vegas. I want Planescape: Torment. I want Dishonored and Deus Ex, but I'll settle for Tomb Raider or even Assassin's Creed II. Remember the tombs with their unique gameplay? The rifts that housed an untold history of the world? What I want are easter eggs, interesting encounters, hidden stories. I'm not asking for much - a bit of history, an audio log, but something meaningful, not just another RNG upgrade of the same variety that every enemy vomits up when lightly prodded. And if we're doing treasure, either make it unique, or make it in a currency that's a) rare enough and b) contributes to unlocking actual meaningful upgades. You can do both. A secret stash in Dishonored is likely to yield you a rune or a trinket, a fragment of a diary and some environmental storytelling explaining why those items are there. Were they stolen by a rogue witch-hunter or is this ransacked apartment secretly a cultist's abode? Going off the beaten path in New Vegas would lead you to whole new locations, quests and stories, but not everyone can be New Vegas. But maybe at least someone could strive to.\n\nSo many games build these fantastic worlds but then can't properly incentivize exploration because the development process doesn't allow for the placing of unique little stories in secret locations, while the game systems don't allow for interesting or unique rewards. I mean, we still explore and still go \"Huh, neat\" when we reach an interesting spot. But those spots always have that annoying whiff of wasted opportunity.",

        "text": "Dear TrueGaming community,\n\nafter finishing [a video project](https://youtu.be/B6QG9IVufOk) in which I explore this question in relationship to Dungeon &amp; Dragons Online, I am eager to read your thoughts on the matter. Since I recently spent time considering the implications regarding DDO, it will serve as my example, yet other titles are of equal consideration.\n\nDDO is based on DnD 3.5 yet as a MMORPG possesses unique constraints entirely different than a tabletop experience. For example, DnD is asynchronous &amp; round-based. This provides time as a resource for players to spend regarding what to do next. Many actions are considered instead being instinctual -- more planned than reactive.\n\nDDO, however, uses a real-time system. This selects for more instinctive play with only minor consideration for planning or devising stratagems.\n\nBalance here is key: both systems can work well assuming the underlying math is suitable for the experience intended for the target audience. Yet what draws my attention here is that when I played DDO, the instinctive selection of combat caused me to feel as if I was not playing a DnD game -- much like the feeling when playing Neverwinter (not Neverwinter Nights although that comparison is equally interesting for other reasons).\n\nThis tension is the result of innovation -- a developer trying to translate a tradition into a newer form. Yet in my experience, the evolution provided a new experience at the cost of leaving the fun of the prior into oblivion.\n\nWhat other titles struggle against this phenomena? If you have played DDO/Neverwinter specifically, do you think the move to a real-time pseudo-round based system works well? Am I missing the forest for the trees?\n\nBest,",

        "text": "Hey everyone! First post here so I hope everything is in order.\n\nI'm guessing most people won't really give a damn about what I think of the game's plot but I did want to share my opinion somewhere so here goes nothing. First of all I want to make clear that I do think this game is good. Quite disappointing in my opinion but still good. BUT I have to admit I think the story really is a jumbled mess.\n\nMainly I think it comes down to the plot lacking any sense of focus or direction. I actually think the story is alright until you rescue Tyr (so pretty early into the game). I actually find the intro to be one of the best parts of the game. We get a setup on how Kratos and Atreus are currently living and have an incredibly hype first meeting with Odin and Thor so right off the bat we know the top Aesir are a force to be reckoned with. Most importantly after all of this we get a basic direction of where the story is going: turns out Tyr is alive and shows up in a bunch of Jotnar prophecies so we should go rescue him. Now that's totally cool, but logically you'd think rescuing Tyr would naturally lead into the next plot point. Except it doesn't, and after this the wider narrative of the game completely falls apart in my opinion.\n\nIt really feels like the game just throws random set pieces at you from this point onwards. Oh, now we're going to Groa's shrine, now Freya suddenly decides we have to go break her curse, now we have to find the Norns, now we need to kill a giant dog, etc. All these set pieces are incredibly well made on a technical level and are fun in isolation (except for Ironwood, that shit dragged to no end), but when it comes to stringing them together to make an overarching plot they just fail completely. Several times throughout the game after the end of a set piece you literally have to go back to your hub area at Sindri's house and think about what to do next because the individual plot segments just don't flow naturally into each other. It really feels like the game throws a bunch of events at you which aren't really all that connected until eventually Ragnarok starts and that's it. Something I liked about the 2018 game was it had a clear sense of direction. The plot always knew where it wanted to go. At all points of the game you knew you were working towards spreading Faye's ashes. Sure, there were detours, but you always felt like you were working towards a particular goal. In Ragnarok on the other hand, the game tries to tackle so many plot threads that it just feels like the story has no idea where it wants to go.\n\nHonestly I feel like the only sections of the game that I felt were actively moving the story forward were the Atreus sections in Asgard, since those actually forwarded Odin's plan and Ragnarok really only starts once Atreus' use to Odin has been expended. Some of the sections with Kratos felt outright filler-y at times.\n\nSome plot points I feel are introduced but are never given the necessary time to properly develop or are outright thrown out the window. The worst offender of this I believe is Odin's mask. A decent amount of time is spent on this mask, looking for its pieces and hearing Oding talk about it. Despite this, we never know what this mask or the rift actually are and the plot point gets thrown away at the very end of the game. It doesn't even serve to heighten the stakes since at no point does Odin even manage to have the full mask for more than like 10 seconds. I understand that maybe the reason for the mask was not so much to actually have a reveal as to what it does but instead give Odin some depth in that he was thinking about what lied beyond godhood. This doesn't sound bad on paper but if it was the case it really needed much more development. As it is now the whole mask thing is just frustrating. I won't go into as much detail on this, but the plot point about the giants sealing their souls into marbles and whatnot what also introduced to not really be touched upon again (not until the very end of the game at the very least). I really expected the Jotnar to have a more prominent role in the game's plot but they really just didn't.\n\nA quick note on Thor. I liked where they were going with his character, I'm fine with him being a \"destroyer\" due to his manipulative relationship with his father rather than it being an intrsinsic characteristic of his. Despite this, he really needed more development. Right when it seemed like we were getting some in the section with Atreus and Thor in Niflheim, their time together is cut short and Thor doesn't show up again until his boss fight in Ragnarok. They tried to make him somewhat sympathetic in the redeemable sense (or at least that's how I saw it) but he's simply not given enough depth and the strangely quick way in which he's killed off really doesn't help.\n\nAlso I have to mention, the actual event of Ragnarok was incredibly underwhelming. It's in the the game's title, you'd expect it to last longer than 30 minutes. But no, you get a bunch of bog standard Einherjar corridor fights, 2 boss fights and you're done. It feels incredibly rushed. The fight between Thor and Jormungandr is only shown in the background despite being teased since the 2018 game and the way we see the serpent being shot into the past is very underwhelming, he literally just gets booped out of existence. The 2 boss fights are okay, I found the Odin one to be a little uninspired but maybe that's just me. I thought the way they treated Odin's death was rather generic considering how much they had hyped up his cunning intellect. Frankly I didn't even expect a traditional boss fight for Odin, I thought some sort of mind game would have been a lot more fitting. But no, you just beat him up and the way his death plays out is morally just black and white (in contrast to Baldur's death in the 2018 game which I thought was very well executed). Surtr might as well have not been there since despite there being an entire set piece in Muspelheim to find him he barely does anything in Ragnarok and you don't really interact with him. They literally put a giant fire monster in the climax of the game only to not make him partake in any sort of epic scene. Honestly I thought Ragnarok would be a few hours long at the very least. I really couldn't believe it was actually over when it ended.\n\nAnd finally I found the ending to be quite rushed. Despite the scope of this story being a lot bigger than 2018's, I thought the ending to 2018 was a lot more grandiose, at least on an emotional level, than any part of Ragnarok's ending. The only thing I can really praise is the development of Kratos' and Atreus' relationship. I do think some of their scenes together are very well written, and in particular the scene in the tent right before Ragnarok made me tear up. You can see the pain in Kratos' face as he finally takes in the fact that he's sending his own son to war. Overall though despite having a lot more content than 2018, Ragnarok's story at the very end still manages to feel rushed, which kinda baffles me.\n\nThat's really it. I know the post ended up being kinda long so thank you to anyone that actually read the entire thing. I'd love to hear opinions from people on whether they agree or disagree with whatever I said. I'm more than happy to discuss this and see where other people who liked the plot more than I did might be coming from. Honestly I just wanted to share this since I've mostly been seeing a lot of praise for this game's story, while I think that even though the perfomances are great the plot is frankly mediocre.",

Can barely playe BL on NS due to the controlls, but i think i came out with a sollution...\nGamers and Gamettes i give you \"switchable-constantly moveing-motion controlls\". Let me explain, first MC (motion controls) suck, as you have to keep your controller in 1 position, unlike a mouse wich you can lift and move back to the center. So why not give us a bind key wich turns MC on and off. So you move your controller almost like a mouse then press a button to turn it off and center your controller. 2nd, instead of haveing to do a 360° turn with a controller to make the character spin 360°, why not have a calibration for what defines a center of the controller and the rings that move the crosshair in a certiant direction untill you put the controller into the \"calibrated\" area where it dosent move anymore. Basically if we say \"0\" is the center, and i move the controller \"0&gt;\" it will keep going \"&gt;\" untill i put the controller back into \"0\" (i know this is a verry poor/shitty explenation). I feel like this could make Motion Controll work far better and more like a mouse setup.",

        "text": "Me and a group had a long discussion about this the other day and I wanted to share my thoughts on the subject. Mainly concerning the bloat of games, specifically Call of Duty. This is not a new concept, ever since battle royales became a thing we have seen games completely change direction to get a piece of the pie. Call of Duty has been one of these games since the release of Modern Warfare (2019) and Warzone. They are also one of the games that has been the most up front about switching their entire core of their series to be a battle royale instead of their traditional multiplayer mode.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nModern Warfare 2 comes in this season with even more genre bloat, adding a \"Tarkov\" like mode and raids. These modes being the primary focus, the 60$ multiplayer mode has been pushed to the side. Receiving very little in terms of updates to fix the terrible state of play it is currently in. Worse, the developers recently released patches that broke the game further and nerfed another one of it's primary weapons out of existence. Even with all of these issues, the game is doing well with player numbers off the charts and the game is still selling. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe question to ask is, since the multiplayer mode of CoD is being neglected so much, is it time to see another game released to take it's place? Should a game like Titanfall or a clone of just the traditional CoD experience be released to compete? And would it do well with the current CoD having issues? Should it be F2P?",

        "text": "Upon its release I played and eventually dropped A Plague Tale: Requiem. There are myriad reasons I could give for why, but I think the best way to summarize it is that it was a checkbox game.\n\nGood visuals? Check.\nFull voice acting? Check.\nOrchestral soundtrack? Check.\nProgression tree/system? Check.\nExtensive story? Check.\n\nYou get my point.\n\nThe game hits all the boxes that people often are clamoring for. The elements that reviewers often go through one by one as if ticking off a grocery list. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these elements. The mistake is in thinking that the inclusion of these elements automatically make a game better. And APT:R makes that mistake.\n\nSure, there may be full voice acting, but 90% of the main characters' constant chatter is either useless and banal (from both a character and plot perspective) or actively detracts from the game by telling me what I need to do during puzzles/encounters and removing the need for me to think for myself. This is an issue that has again risen to wider attention in God of War: Ragnarok.\n\nOr take the visuals. They are easily some of the most impressive I've ever seen in a video game, which is all the more impressive given the size and budget of the team behind APT:R. But when all those visuals serve to do is gussy up an overlong scene of a boy following a bird through a field, it makes me feel like I've been duped into wasting my time. It's the equivalent of SpongeBob's fancily drawn \"The.\" It's a lot for a little. The game is obviously more than just that one scene, but when the core gameplay is already a light stealth-action-puzzle game, and when those elements are even further diluted by the aforementioned character chatter, the boy walking through the field and the rest of the game start to become a lot closer in difficulty and player engagement than they initially seem.\n\nIn sum, I would like to place a moratorium on games that feel as if they are mindlessly ticking off checkboxes. I know one Reddit post won't change anything. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask.",

Without objective markers, I spend more time trying to figure out where I'm supposed to go.  \"Duh, it's forcing you to engage with the level layout,\" you might say.  And while, yes, that's true.  It can deter exploration because if you lose track of where you are, you have to go through that effort all over again.  Whereas a marker acts as a point of reference so there's no worry about getting lost when you wonder off.\n\nAnd if you'll notice, the games where markers are the most prevalent are 3d games with open-ended level design.  Even games that don't always point out the objective themselves, like BotW and Elden Ring offer way more direction than their previous installments and even let the player place their own markers.",

        "text": "Now lets talk about what makes this game appealing. Visually it is spectacular, the death animations are ultra violent and well done, the creatures in the game are beautifully designed, and the overall atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect setting around a space horror game. As for the story it's nothing you've never heard of before, but still the acting is good enough despite it being a rather short game. \n\nIt only takes under ten total hours to defeat the game, and even if you want to be able to do all you can in the game that'll take you fourteen total hours. \n\nAs a person who always wants a challenge I tend to go on the harder difficulties, in TCP every difficulty is a death sentence. The main issue in this game is the difficulty I feel. This isn't a case of the ol \"Get gud.\" chirp either. A lot of times you're just going to get jumped and just die over and over again. You can upgrade your weapons as I have but even with upgraded weapons it still seems to take the same amount of hits to kill enemies as it did without the upgrades. \n\nThe healing mechanic is also atrocious in this game. I can almost guarantee you, you will die a few times because of it.  If you're in a fight or flight scenario, its better to just run away. If you cannot run away because it's a boss fight or something like that, just die dude because you have no time to heal. You can run as fast as you want, but even  at my heaviest (which was 300+ pounds)  I ran faster than Jacob does, and I was never being chased by mutated creatures. He basically is fast walking which leads to getting smacked in the back of the head. \n\n You slowly get on your knee, grab the healing gun, stare at it for three seconds then proceed to inject it into your neck. Again if you aren't far away from your enemies you're setting yourself up to die. I healed myself, was hit by the boss, stunned by another enemy freezing my character and by the time I was finally allowed to move my head was caved in. \n\nAnother issue I've noticed and seen others notice as well is the switching of the guns. A few times I try to switch the guns, and I do switch em just to fire on an enemy and get killed because it didn't switch the gun at all. This doesn't always happen, but when it does it can be insanely frustrating. \n\nLastly, for a horror game it really stinks that you can see 98% of jumpscares before they even happen. I don't think this is their fault entirely, as a horror movie fan I've seen enough cliches that I know where to expect a jump scare before they're even present. \n\nThis game I feel is a solid 6.3/10. Not great but also not horrible. I think it's fair to give Striking Distance a break considering this is their first game.",

        "text": " *Cards of Eternity* is a brand-new free-to-play collectible card game from Aether Games, creators of *Gates of Ethernity*. Similar in execution to *Hearthstone*, *Cards of Ethernity* adapts the characters and creatures from *Gates of Ethernity* into a competitive card battler. Players can collect cards via crafting or through the in-game store and use them to assemble decks and take on players across the globe.\n\nAfter a successful stint in closed beta, *Cards of Ethernity* is now entering open beta for everyone to participate. Available starting on December 13, 2022, players can download the official client of [*Cards of Ethernity’s* website](https://coe.gg/) for free and get to collect their cards. At launch, 150 cards will be available and will be split across six different creature types. These include dragons, trolls, fairies, beasts, demons, and elementals.\n\nEach deck in *Cards of Ethernity* consists of 30 cards with an in-game avatar functioning as your player character. These avatars, known as Adventurers, come with a unique pet that has an ability to turn the tide of a battle in your favor. While they may only be used once per game, they will become integral in the makeup of your decks.\n\nAnother unique feature in *Cards of Ethernity* is the ability to sacrifice specific cards to restore your Aether (which essentially acts as mana). With each deck allowing players to have two copies of a specific card, you can sacrifice repeats to power yourself up and gain access to stronger attacks earlier. While those cards will then be out of play, you just might make a Hail Mary that wrestles control away from your opponent.\n\nAt launch, *Cards of Ethernity* will feature 10 adventurers and a plethora of pets. As you do battle and increase your skill, your adventurer will level up and earn passive traits for each level. Currently, there are only 10 levels of mastery, but you are free to swap adventurers whenever you see fit. Mixed with pets, you can create decks that are strong on offensive, have more of a defensive focus, or a mixture of the two. The possibilities are seemingly endless.\n\nYou can get started in *Cards of Ethernity* today by downloading the launcher from [Aether Games’ website](https://coe.gg/). The game will be available on Windows PC with mobile versions coming in the future and is free-to-play. Cards may be purchased, but can also be crafted with in-game currency.\n\n 🐉 🐉 🐉 🐉 🐉",

        "text": "So looking at [these](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/?sort=chg) [figures](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=chg), it seems that there has been a growing trend of steam users using lower end hardware, such as GTX 1650 (which is less powerful than 1060, the former champion), dedicated graphics such as Intel Iris and Radeon Vega, and sub 3 Ghz CPUs. Sub 3GHz CPUs in fact remains the most popular. As energy prices and GPU prices are going up and inflation is happening in most of the world, I think people would prefer using lower end hardware. According to my quick estimation of the PC GPUs steam users utilise, out of the 90.21% of known graphic cards that steam recognise, at least 19.8% of them are still using very low end or low profile graphics hardware, which is approximately less powerful than an intel GT 1030. I don't know how soon these figures will change, but considering the prices and power consumption of newer GPUs, I think the GPU market share will at least be stagnant for quite some time. \n\nWhy aren't tapping this 20% market? The new and upcoming games don't even run great on 1030 and above, I think they're alienating a more significant number of PC players than they're probably estimating. The most popular competitive multiplayer games like Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite etc don't have the greatest graphics, is there any evidence that singleplayer games couldn't be successful with similar graphics? This year, Elden Ring and Sonic Frontiers sold quite well in spite of their less than stellar graphics. Sure, using those games to argue for my point is a double edged sword because they're selling well in spite of how poorly optimised they are, but couldn't they sell even better if they tapped into the potato gaming market too? \n\nI guess the true reason they're not doing this is AAA devs consider tapping the audience outside the comfort of their usual, high income upper middle class costumers to be a high risk.  These people preorder their $60 games and are making a team of 1000 devs financially feasible. The low end PC users on the other hand tend to wait years until the prices go down or simply pirate their games. They would also have to compete with the oversaturated AA and indie market probably. However, is there any evidence that by emphasizing on the low end market, they would alienate the high end market? If they cared about graphics so much, why are they playing Elden Ring, a game which is only comfortably playable on middle to high end hardware? Do graphics still sell a game? Isn't the oversaturation of highly demanding games desensitising people to photorealistic graphics anyway? \n\nWell it's just my own take on this not so unpopular topic of why large game companies are emphasising graphics rather than anything else, and I did provide some data which shows that the mid to low end gaming audience is probably growing. I ultimately don't know what would happen if an AAA company experimented with releasing a singleplayer game for low end hardware. I do think it's worth attempting though, they have the resource to do it. I'm not saying that they should be releasing indie tier games like what you'd find on the switch, but they could try something with Xbox 360 era graphics, something that would run at a steady 90+ fps on modern PCs with affordable dedicated graphics (eg Vega 8 and Intel UHD ) and 30 to 60 fps on older low end PC hardware, instead of ray traced ultra fidelity games.",

        "text": "My biggest issue with piracy is that it makes people that are gamers not giving a shot for indie devs, and worse giving traffic to websites that can be shady and full of malwares.\n\nThere are endless games on [itch.io](https://itch.io), google play made by indie devs wishing for someone to play their games so they can be a bit known. At most you pay 3 dollars, but there are enough games given for free indefinitely or the occasional giveaways. Not to mention the shitload of games made in game jams.\n\nOn [archive.org](https://archive.org) I can find many long forgotten games that are in public domain, and if I want I can go with flash games runners like the ones on newgrounds. And play to my heart desires games by passionate artists.\n\nYet the games people look to pirate are Hades, halo, monster hunter, pretty much any new off the shelf AAA games, that are still able to be found on occasion on free giveaways like epic and gog (thought only on random chance.) I basically have accumulated over 500 AAA games alone for free as a result. And that doesn't include bundles on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and humble.\n\nAnd every time I look at those pirated games it astonishes me the logical loopholes. Hate the AAA practices? play an [itch.io](https://itch.io) game jam. Go on opera.Gx play. Heck, I even got 9gag indie dev giving away free keys for their games.\n\nMy top priority is games made by old acquaintances in my country indie community. The reason why I don't play a lot of AAA is mainly because I prefer the games of friends making and casual lite weight games that are smaller than 1gb on the go. But having the AAA games on display for browsing and playing when a game becomes relevant on one of my gaming libraries. Is enjoyable.\n\nI don't have issue with piracy because it steals money from AAA companies. I have issue with piracy because it takes away recognition from indie devs, and games that otherwise people won't try.\n\nTL;DR There are way too many indie, opensource, and public domain games to justify pirating AAA games. Also want to mention this guy: [tk2236 (stormtrooper on 9gag)](https://9gag.com/u/tk2236)",

That at any moment, you can wander off and get lost in some side adventure.  And if you're not interested, you can just continue doing what you were doing.  You do what appeals to you.\n\nSkyrim's central narrative is relatively short.  Breath of the Wild's central narrative can theoretically reach its climax mere moments after exiting the tutorial.  They're not intended to be short games, they're just not very opinionated about which and how much content the player experiences.  And I'd wager that players find they tend to drag less.  With the bulk of the quests segmented off into their own self-contained stories, a lot more questing time is spent where plot is actually happening.\n\nAnd then you have games like Witcher 3, RDR2, and AC: Valhalla that have these behemoth campaigns that never end.  A lot of the time, the game can feel like it's stringing you along, delaying narrative payoff to the point of exhaustion.  Not to mention that if all the production budget and spectacle is concentrated into the main quest, the side stuff can feel less worth your time.\n\nIt's a very weird way to structure content.  Who is this designed for?  Who are these people who rush through the main campaign at the exclusion of everything else and then turn around and bemoan the shorter game length?",

X and Y is one of the easiest games out there with the champion memed as a joke.\n\nThen there is Sun and Moon where everyone won't shut up.\n\nand Sword and Shield is self explanatory. One of the worst games out there.\n\nNow there is Scarlet and Violet that which has bugs, glitches, and everything that would make it a Cyberpunk level disaster in most gaming eyes.\n\nThe weird thing is that Scarlet and Violet somehow, despite the gaming community rejecting Sword and Shield as a game, and everyone knowing about all of its problems somehow got 10 M in one month, one month. That is more than God of War Ragnarok, a game that everyone agrees is one of the best games of the year 2nd only to Elden Ring. Elden Ring probably didn't sell this well. This is absurd to me, but i have some theories.\n\n1: Pokemon and Nintendo Fans are exceptionally forgiving like Sonic Fans.They will put up with whatever nonsense Game Freak throws at them and consume it like as it was a steak. Meanwhile, if Scarlet and Violet were released by Sony? You'd bet that there would be a backlash and wide spread mocking. It certainly wouldn't reach those high sells.\n\n2: Parents dont' know any better and just mindlessly buy a Pokemon game for their kids. They don't check up on Youtube to see how broken the game is.\n\n3: Casuals being Casuals. They have no real standards whatso ever. That is why you always see bad games like Madden, Fifa, and all of those awful games continue to be released broken and yet still sell well.",

This, I believe, is because of the fact that GoW isn't really an open world game. Midgard acts as a hub world, and you use tyr's temple to get to other worlds. It really went a long way towards making me feel like I was playing a video game. The new game has removed this design philophy, and decided instead to make Midgard just another visitable area like Vanaheim or Nifleheim. I actually believe this detracts from the game experience. It made me feel completely disconnected from the game world, as opposed to the first game, which made me feel like a denizen of midgard traveling around. \n\nI don't know, I'm having a hard time putting my thoughts into words, but the change definetly changed the vibe of the game. What do you think? was this change a welcome one? or do you prefer the 2018 style of game design?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zks7c1/instatournaments_multiplayer_solitaire_as_a_way/",
        "text": " Celebrated among players at the time, but apparently largely unnoticed by game developers, *Zach Gage* invented a very special game mode for **Pocket-Run Pool** in 2018.\n\nThe so-called “Insta-Tournaments” build on the established concept of “Daily Challenges”, where all players of a single-player game are given one attempt a day to play the daily “seed” — a run featuring the same random generation for all players — to be able to compare their results. At the end of the day, the leaderboard for the previous day is saved and the next run is generated.\n\nSimilarly, in Pocket-Run Pool players try to clear the pool table after a random opening. But with his instant tournaments, Gage pushed the concept of seeds even further. Players didn’t just get one chance to compare their scores on a daily basis, but — depending on overall activity — basically whenever they wanted to. Every couple of minutes, a new tournament was generated for small groups of sometimes just a few players.\n\n## A Different Kind of Dynamic Difficulty\n\nOne might think that this conceptual twist would not only increase the frequency of [feedback](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FabianFischer/20161104/284769/Systemic_Feedback_in_Competitive_Games.php), but also open up new design possibilities.\n\nHowever, it took a year and a half for the idea to be picked up again by *Arnold Rauers* in **Maze Machina** and its “Challenge” mode. This time around, it’s not about generating billiard tables but a series of tactically demanding, tile-based roguelike levels, but the fundamental idea is the same.\n\nHowever, the mode introduces a ranking system on top and thereby opens up a meta layer above the tournaments themselves. For each tournament, players gain or lose ranking points depending on how well they did. Based on their overall rank, they are then placed on a global leaderboard. At first sight, this isn’t a terribly complex structure, but it hints are the potential of the concept.\n\nFor example, instant tournaments could be a valid alternative to [single-player matchmaking](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FabianFischer/20181030/326624/The_Reset_Problem_A_Case_for_Singleplayer_Matchmaking.php), which usually gets quite complicated in terms of design and the details of its implementation. Dividing players into tournament groups not only at certain time intervals but also based on their current meta rank, will challenge them according to their abilities and ensures that their skill level is accurately reflected in the tournament table.\n\n## Advantages: Accuracy &amp; Granularity\n\nA significant advantage of this approach: The level of difficulty not only adapts to a player’s rank, but also to the variance of the randomly generated setup. Generating an “outlier match” every now and then is perfectly fine, since the other tournament participants are facing the exact same situation. For example, if a particular run is very difficult, many players will not do too well and thus comparatively “weak” results will suffice to top the rankings.\n\nMatchmaking using a pure single-player Elo system has its weaknesses in this area in particular. Basically the game would have to recognize said difficulty fluctuations between the matches and move its goal posts accordingly. This is such a complex problem — especially for “just” a meta-game feature — that it’s usually not even being tried. Now, restricting the random generator to only ever create fair challenges is an option of course, but also results in less varied gameplay overall. Quite the balancing act.\n\nAnother advantage of instant tournaments lies in their granularity. Of course, they are somewhat dependent on an active player base. If one exists however, players can essentially be grouped together by any skill level, which means the game can account for the tiniest differences in skill. This results in much more exact levels of difficulty than those you would find on a rather rigid single-player ladder, where ranks do not only have to be accurately predicted, but also implemented manually.\n\n## A High-Potential Shortcut\n\nIn a way, “Insta-tournaments” can therefore be considered a design shortcut: single-player matchmaking based on multiplayer data. The unbeatable swarm intelligence of the player base provides the input to find the proper challenge for every single player. Clever!\n\nA possible downside, [once again](https://medium.com/@fischerdesign/the-philosophy-of-competitive-games-ed3873140f9), lies in the act of qualitatively sorting people into tables. Perhaps, one could add a layer of abstraction and disconnect the collected data from actual human players. For any individual player, things would then simply look like a “normal” solitaire game. On the other hand, a competition can hardly be framed more neutrally and indirectly than in the examples mentioned above. Fortunately, we’re far from the “megakill” here.\n\nIn any case, it would be nice if it didn’t take years every time for game designers to continue their experiments in this direction. There’s quite a bit of untapped potential here. Don't you think?",

Duke Nukem Forever took 14 years to finish, but that game went through bunch of development hell, including bankruptcy. This game, while the devs claim their laptops were \"stolen,\" they never really showed the evidence of it, did they? Plus, even if it is true, they don't have any excuse for not finishing the game this long.\n\nFrom I understand this game is quite popular among streaming community, and, as a result, a lot of kids also buy this game as \"minecraft, but with zombies!\" kind of mindset. But it still doesn't change the fact that the devs are avoiding criticism of massive bugs and problems in core mechanics by staying in \"early access\" forever. Plus, whenever they have a major update, they get to be on the front of a steam page, which drives sales. So guess it's a scummy win-win for them.\n\nPeople say the game has changed a lot, and yes, some of the mechanics in game did change, but it wasn't something that was in the original scope of the game. I've seen their patch notes, and what I've noticed is a quite disturbing pattern. Basically, what the devs are simply incorporating mods that someone else developed, patch some already known bugs from that mod, and claim that the game is constantly being updated. For example, the feature that is now fully incorporated in game, which is perishable and decomposing environment, was quite a popular mod back when I was playing this game back in 2013~2014, and the mechanics implemented in current build is almost the same.\n\nQuite a brilliant business model, I guess. Make someone else work for your project while basically writing an elongated essay about how they will \"incorporate\" features from the mods and highlight some other popular mods they will \"steal\" next.\n\nRant aside, my gripe is basically how they're given such a slack even after 11 years. They're shying away from actual criticisms of the game while actively policing the forum and steam community like crazy. When there's a steam discussion threat that criticize the state of the game, I can bet you my bottom dollar that devs and their personal army of kids will show up and bully you until you either delete the game or just simply quit and accept the fact that you just handed 15 dollars of your money that could've spent on better \"finished\" games on similar price range like Hades to scummy devs at Indiestone...",

Tier 4 undercovers only exist to start a cop chase because they're not marked on the mini-map. \nAnd at tier 5 you better hope you're in a S tier car. Tier 5 police chases bring 3 things:  \n\n* Heavy units which are basically tanks but they're about as fast as the interceptors  \n* Helicopters that will follow you everywhere unless you're in a tunnel or something similar (and there aren't a lot of\nhiding places)  \n* Every cop becomes super aggressive (Tier 3 interceptors, for example, let you draft until the finish line, \ntier 5 interceptors are basically HIMARS missiles)  \n\nOh, and you can't switch your car while free-roaming, so if you're coming out of a B tier race into a tier 5 cop chase: \nyou're fucked.  \n\nWait, you thought that the police was only annoying in races? No! Didn't you hear: Metal Gear Solid is kinda popular so \nwe gotta have stealth sections in this game. Ok, I'm only half kidding, besides turning your engine off there isn't any \nstealth in this game. And yet I found myself sneaking around quite a lot the first 10-ish hours. Being in a slow car with high heat \nmade me really anxious. There were a lot of instances of me just driving at pedestrian speeds behind a cop for minutes on end \nand it left a sour taste in my mouth. That feeling does go away with a better car and when you realize preemptive murder \nis the best way to deal with police.  \n\nSo yeah, for me the police are such a huge issue that I don't think they could be improved and I'd rather see them gone instead.  \n\n**The Progression**  \n\nIt's so bad I don't even know where to start. I think I'll go with the least offensive one first: The car tiers are named \nhorribly. You got B, A, A+, S, S+... why? I'm usually rather indifferent about the existence of an S tier above A, but the \nstructuring is just plain bad. Why not E, D, C, B, A? Now onto the good stuff: The career.  \n\nThe career is rather simple: You get 4 weeks, each week you race monday thru friday collecting as much money as possible, \nsaturday is event time. 3 qualifiers and \"The Grand\" at the end of week 4. The Grand is this special event for which you \nneed to have 4 pimped out cars, one in each tier (cept for B tier because....). I have to say I like the simplicity of the \ncareer even tho it's a little short (spoiler alert: The Grand is the end of the career, all in all it should take you about \n15-20 hours to reach the end game). You are also \"gifted\" cars occasionally (tho they'll have a hefty buy-in price) \nso you don't have to worry about not having enough \nmoney for new cars too much. But you will have to worry about money anyway.  \n\nMoney is properly _scarce_ in this game. To the point where I don't think I've bought more than 1 car outside of the Bugatti.  \nEach race awards you with anywhere from $2_000 to $50_000 and several heat levels. By the way, heat does not reset from day \nto night, only from night to day. There are few events that net more than $20_000 each half-day so I've found myself in \na rhythm of only racing 2-3 races max per half-day. By the end, when I was grinding for the Bugatti, I got around $75_000 on \naverage per half-day. To put that into perspective, high-end performance upgrades usually range around $20_000 to $50_000 \nper upgrade and there are 14 performance upgrade slots. You can also upgrade a car's engine (tho I don't think I ever did that) \nfor around $300_000 to $400_000 for a worthwhile upgrade.  \n\nSay, do you like doing maths in your head? Of course you do, so you'll love this nifty mechanic called **buy-in**.  \nEach race will award you with $Y but you'll have to pay $X upfront for the privilege of participating, and you gotta have \nthe X to appreciate the Y. In practice this means comparing race rewards while doing high-speed math. Do you take the \n_\"Big Money\"_ event with a $20_000 reward and $8_000 buy-in, or the random $40_000 event with $8_000 buy-in. No wait, there's \na race with a huge $64_000 reward but an equally huge $32_000 buy-in. Buy-ins should be removed as well in the next entry.  \n\nWhile buy-ins do prevent you from entering races if you don't have the cash, this is unlikely to happen much and not the big \nissue here. The issue is that the qualifiers and the Grand have buy-ins as well (The Grand is a whopping $200_000) and \nyou have to upgrade your garage to get high-end performance upgrades. Garage level 3 costs $50_000, level 4 costs $100_000. \nYou'll have to upgrade your garage to afford better performance upgrades and balance upgrading your cars with the buy-in \nfor the qualifier. If you can't afford the buy-in to a qualifier or the Grand it's game over, you'll have to repeat the \nprevious day and make better financial choices.  \n\nThe worst part for me? I stopped upgrading my car 1.5 weeks before the Grand. I had all my cars where I wanted them to be \nbut the buy-in system and the **EXTREMELY** low rewards for races discourage buying and pimping out cars just for fun.  \nAs I mentioned before I grinded the Bugatti after finishing the story. That took me about 8 hours or so to go from $1.2m \nafter the grand to the $3.6m required for the Bugatti. And it was really underwhelming. Yeah it was an instant win button \nfor all the races, but it doesn't really feel that great when the Mercedes 190 accelerates faster than my Bugatti at the start \nof the race.  \n\nAlso, did I mention that there are only like 5 different tracks if you always go for the most pay out? Grinding got real \nexhausting real fast.  \n\n**tl;dr**  \n\nProblems exist, but after 11 (15 if you don't count Shift) years of trash games, Unbound is a beacon of hope. Not worth $70 \nbut if you can get it for $20 or $30 it might be worth it for NFS fans to see where the Series is going. For everyone else: \nForza Horizon 5 exists. If you can wait 10 days the premium edition will cost about was much as Unbound does but with \nway more content and Hot Wheels.",
