        "text": "#[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/9bxyoa/were_rtheredditfilmproject_a_community_creating/)\n\n**r/TheRedditFilmProject** is a collective passion project made up of Redditor filmmakers from all over the world. Our mission: to create short films based on popular Reddit stories. Our long term goal is to compile these short films to form **The Reddit Anthology**.\n\nTo take on this monumental task, each production is divided into 5 phases: **CONCEPT, SCRIPT, PRE-PRODUCTION, PRODUCTION, and POST-PRODUCTION**.\n\nWe believe the **CONCEPT** and **SCRIPT** phases are of particular interest to the members of r/Scriptwriting, so we’ll spend more time explaining these.\n\nIn the CONCEPT phase, Redditors pitch in concepts based on Reddit posts, comments and threads. We often get fiction and some true stories, but the source material can wildly vary. We have a couple of concepts based on pictures, and even one based on an entire subreddit!\n\nWe are somewhat flexible with what to accept: if the pitch offers an interesting treatment, or if the source itself is evidently compelling, we’ll add it to our queue. We believe the only real criteria are that the story has a connection with Reddit, and that it is not created solely for The Reddit Film Project. \n\nOnce we accept a pitch, we contact the OP to ask for permission. It’s a bit of a hit-or-miss: some OPs are inactive or throwaway accounts, others are just not interested. But more often than not, many of the OPs are gracious enough to give their blessing to us.\n\nOver the course of the project we have garnered some notable OP relationships: for example, prolific Redditor u/RamsesThePigeon has given as an unprecedented blanket permission for all his works. Also, sci-fi novelist Andy Weir (u/sephalon) has given us his blessing to adapt his short fiction. Our adaptation of Weir’s The Egg is finishing the SCRIPT phase soon.\n\nSpeaking of, once we get OP’s blessing, the story moves from CONCEPT to the SCRIPT phase. In these phase, writers get to choose from the list of approved concepts, and adapt it into a short film script. A script can be written by a single member, or as a collaboration. When a writer claims a concept, it is theirs for the entire SCRIPT phase. \n\nUsually, we gun for a running time between 5 to 10 minutes. Also, we often involve another writer to act as a script consultant, who takes on a draft and helps strengthen the story further. Once we finish a script, we forward it to the PRE-PRODUCTION phase.\n\nThe other three phases, PRE-PRODUCTION, PRODUCTION, and POST-PRODUCTION, follows the more traditional process of film production, slightly modified for Reddit. By the time a story elevates to PRE-PRODUCTION, we select a Director via an open call, and this Director will oversee the process until completion. The Director is free to decide on how to proceed: they can bring their own team, or post additional open calls to get other sub members involved.\n\nAll of these are chronicled on our Trello board we nicknamed [**THE HIVE**](https://trello.com/b/O2yg4QAN/the-reddit-anthology-hive). You can visit it now and see the current status of our stories. We already have some 30+ approved concepts that need writers. 4 are currently in the SCRIPT phase, 2 are in PRE-PRODUCTION, and one ready for PRODUCTION.\n\nOnce we have accumulated enough films, we intend to compile them into The Reddit Anthology, a feature-length film. This will be our end goal. \n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to invite you guys to take part in this historic task of adapting Reddit into film. You can visit our sub, or join us in [**our Discord server**](https://discord.gg/Jc2gk6y). A more comprehensive description of our processes is available in our Reddit sidebar.\n\nFor now, if there’s anything about the project you need clarified, please, ask us anything! Mods u/yahuga and u/KRBrooks will represent The Reddit Film Project in this AMA. u/yahuga is a Filipino film editor and writer, and u/KRBrooks is a Chicago-based cinematographer. Helping them in the background are fellow mods u/tensouder54 and u/yuvi64.\n\n[TRFP logo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387419848206057472/471817699861987368/RFP_Banner_v2.png)\n\nProof: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/9GgWLFk\n\nhttps://imgur.com/q77Ag5K",

        "text": "#[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9blyx8/im_mary_robinette_kowal_author_of_the_lady/)\n\nHi there! I'm Mary Robinette Kowal and I have three unrelated careers. I'm an author, a professional puppeteer, and an audiobook narrator.\n\nMy short fiction is sort of all over the speculative fiction map. My novels are science-fiction or fantasy. (So far.) The first series, The Glamourist Histories, is sort of like Jane Austen with magic. Then I did Ghost Talkers, which is set in WWI with ghosts and mediums and spycraft and stuff like that. But you're probably interested in the Calculating Stars, which is book one of the Lady Astronaut duology. Oh! And if you want to read free stories, I have some on my site. I’m also a member of the Hugo-award winning podcast Writing Excuses.\n\nSo there's also the puppetry. In high school, I was doing puppetry as a hobby, but I went after an art degree, minoring in theater and speech. While performing as Audrey II in a performance of Little Shop of Horrors, a professional puppeteer came to the show and I was like... \"Wait. People actually pay you? To do this?\" And pretty much changed career paths on the dime. I went on to intern at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA. With over twenty years of experience, I have performed for LazyTown (CBS), the Center for Puppetry Arts, Jim Henson Pictures and Sesame Street. You got questions about puppets? I got answers.\n\nFor the audiobook stuff, I'm a member of SAG/AFTRA. As the voice behind several audio books and short stories, I've recorded fiction for authors such as Neal Stephenson, Cory Doctorow and Seanan McGuire. And my own books, too. It's sorta like puppetry, without the pain.\n\nI live in Chicago with my husband Robert and, at current count, nineteen manual typewriters.\n\nAnd now random stuff -- I lived in Iceland for year and a half, working on the show Lazytown. Two cats. I'm obligated to mention the cats, right? I include a Doctor Who cameo in every novel.\n\nWhen I say that you can ask me anything, I really mean it. I’ll talk about everything from hand-sewing period costumes, to shoving my hand up things, to writing, to depression.\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/MaryRobinette/status/1034969392386371584",

I’m based on Florida’s Treasure Coast in Stuart, Fla., “Sailfish Capital of the World” where I have been telling fish stories and writing fish obits for about 25 years. We catch an awful lot of fish down here in the Sunshine State.

This summer we all learned it’s hard to sight cast to a trophy tarpon or snook when it’s floating dead on the surface of a bay.\nLet’s talk about how this happened, what needs to happen to change it, and how Florida’s political situation factors into the creation and solutions of this environmental and economic crisis.  \nHere are some of my recent bylines:\n\n[Florida’s toxic algae crisis: Are gulf and freshwater seafood safe to eat?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/florida/2018/08/10/florida-seafood-safe-eat-red-tide-blue-green-algae-cyanobacteria-crabs-fish-healthy/960483002/)\n\n[Toxic water suffocates Stuart fisherman’s commercial fishing business](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/08/02/toxic-water-suffocates-stuart-fishermans-commercial-fishing-business/873675002/)\n\n[Algae is in the news again, and it’s not good for any of us](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/08/02/toxic-water-suffocates-stuart-fishermans-commercial-fishing-business/873675002/)\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/n7sosi45aoi11.jpg",

I cover the environment too.\n\nLast week, Quartz and the Texas Observer published a nine-part series on the complexities of border water in a hotter, drier world. You can read the stories in the [Texas Observer, here](https://www.texasobserver.org/shallow-waters/), or in [Quartz, here](https://qz.com/se/shallow-waters/).\n\nOur report focused on the Texas-Mexico border, which is actually a river—the Rio Grande—and one that is running out. The Rio Grande Valley is one of the fastest-growing and fastest-warming places in the country. And climate change is making the region hotter and more arid. The Rio Grande is the main source of water to 6 million people and 2 million acres of farmland on both sides of the border. \n\nThe cracks are already beginning to show. Farmers and cities in the Valley are in a [tug of war](https://www.texasobserver.org/bordering-on-empty/) to control the river’s dwindling supplies. As those run out, some predict a [run on groundwater](https://qz.com/1353839/theres-a-time-bomb-for-us-mexico-relations-ticking-underground/)—a diplomatic situation neither side is prepared to face. Meanwhile, the intended border wall could threaten both sides with [floods](https://www.texasobserver.org/the-texas-mexico-border-wall-comes-with-a-dangerous-costly-side-effect-flooding/).\n\nBut we found examples of cooperation, too. [El Paso has worked with Ciudad Juarez](https://qz.com/1353825/a-major-us-city-will-start-drinking-its-own-sewage-others-need-to-follow/) to conserve water and the U.S. and Mexico are in talks to improve protections for the river.

        "text": "Thirteen years ago today, Hurricane Katrina rendered 100% of the homes in New Orleans’ historic Lower Ninth Ward uninhabitable after storm surge caused a major levee breach along the Army Corps of Engineers’ man-dredged Industrial Canal. Since then, homeowners in this community have faced multiple barriers to recovery, perhaps the most serious of which was Louisiana’s ill-fated Road Home - a disaster recovery program eventually found to be discriminatory in federal court. Pre-Katrina population of the Lower Ninth Ward was 98.1% African-American, and over 60% lived below the national AMI (average mean income), yet the Lower Ninth Ward enjoyed one of the highest rates of black home ownership in the nation, as it was home to many of the city’s first free people of color. True population return of these at-risk residents is estimated at only 36.7% - significantly lower than the citywide average. Thirteen years after the storm, thousands of homes sit in blighted and unlivable condition, and thousands of lots where houses once stood remain empty. A great number of these lots now belong to the government, and no effort has been made to return them to their original owners.\n\nlowernine.org’s mission is simple - to return pre-Katrina residents of the Lower Ninth Ward to safe and affordable housing, and to mitigate blight in the community. lowernine.org uses volunteer labor under skilled staff supervision to rebuild flood-damaged properties and to build new homes, bringing construction costs down to approximately 30% of open market rate. Since 2007, we have worked with volunteers from 37 different countries, providing over $9 million in volunteer labor in the completion of 87 full home builds and over 300 smaller repairs and renovations for our clients.\n\nUnfortunately, with the passage of time, many have forgotten Katrina and the levee breaches, and don’t know that recovery efforts are very much ongoing. For over a decade, we have been repeatedly reminded that while disasters don’t discriminate, recoveries do. As the memory of the devastating events of 2005 begins to fade, it is vital that we increase our efforts and continue working until this community is fully rebuilt.  As the Executive Director for lowernine.org, I make sure this message is clear, and that work continues.

When I was 19, I read a line from the Navy’s recruiting campaign that spoke to me: “If someone wrote a book about your life, would anyone want to read it?”\n\nI realized I wanted to make a difference in the world, so I enlisted as an Equipment Operator ([Seabee](https://www.navy.com/careers/construction?cid=sm_rd_p0818r&amp;activity=1234580)) and left ten days later. In my career, I’ve built ballistic fish tanks in Iraq, forward operating bases in Afghanistan, and hospital waiting areas in Jamaica. My job is basically to keep people safe and make sure my fellow Sailors get home to their families.\n\nJoining the Navy [transformed my life](https://www.navy.com/faces-fleet-ep-05-dirt-sailor?cid=sm_rd_p0818s&amp;activity=1234580) into a story worth telling.

Some of those questions were tough, some of them made me smile, more than a few made me chuckle out loud.  I want to personally thank every single one of you that participated in this AMA and I hope that I was able to answer a few questions in turn.  If there are any others that I failed to get to, you can always find me over on r/Navy or occasionally on r/DadJokes (and also not using an official Navy handle).  I want to close with a thought that you can take for what it is worth to you...\n\nEvery day of our lives we are afforded opportunities to be a force for good in the lives of others.  We can enrich each other.  We can raise each other up.  We can help.  We can heal.  We can teach.  We can learn...  or we can do nothing.  There is nothing wrong with living on a sweet potato farm in the middle of nowhere if that is what makes you happy and completes you as a person, but for me I needed something more.  The Navy gave me that chance and my only regret thus far is that I did not dive onto that opportunity sooner.  It is my personal belief that each of us is guilty of all the good we have never done.  The Navy simply allowed me to do more.",
