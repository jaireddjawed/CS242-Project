Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values.\n\nI'd love to learn more about how he dealt with these issues and what his thoughts about them are. Specifically dealing with an upbringing at odds with your nature and the sexual issues he struggled with.\n\nWhat is the best place to start reading his work? He seems to have produced quite a lot. I was thinking of starting with either \"If it die\" or an abridged version of his journals however I wonder whether it's easier to start with some fiction.\n\nThanks very help for any thoughts you may have, I appreciate you time helping me.",

For example, Modernism would be associated with writers like Joyce, Kafka, Proust, Woolf etc etc. Specifically in the case of modernism, these writers (along with other famous modernists) came very early into the modernist movement, so early that I assume they were the creators of the movement.\n\nBut I'm sure you can give me an answer saying that Joyce and Proust etc did not start modernism, but other lesser known writers did and they just built on what came before. \n\nIs this correct? \n\np.s.

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm wondering if any theoretical work has been done on reading personal correspondence/diaries as literary scholars. For example, reading an author's correspondence NOT in order to illuminate his/her fictional writing, but as a text in itself, perhaps as an independent genre. \n\nMany historians believe that they do not have the tools to adequately analyze personal writing, since it is not strictly speaking an example of a historical document. The emotion, biases, and rhetorical aim of the writer is something that belongs to literary studies...\n\nOn the other hand, I rarely see any literary scholar engaging directly with \"epistolarity.\" The notable exception being, of course, epistolary novels.\n\nIt's almost as if no one wants to analyze them! \n\nOne of the problems I can see is that letters were not often intended to be published. Reading these would therefore constitute a misplacement of investigative appropriateness, sort of like analyzing a gum wrapper as if it were a work of art hung in a museum. But, even if letters weren't meant to be published, they still participate in a certain generic category that its writer and its recipient necessarily agreed upon. It's still a conscious act of writing that relies on a certain author/reader contract. \n\nAny bibliographic help would be much appreciated here! \n\nThanks\n\n",

It’s too portable, she feels, as if the whole establishment could be folded up in a minute and transported and unfolded almost anywhere else”, 250; “To touch his hand, which is there in plain view, […], would be to put herself at risk again, and she is already at risk. Once she delighted in being at risk; but once she did everything too much.”, 255; “Yvonne avoids shaking hands with him. It occurs to her that he is the last man she will ever have the energy to love. It’s so much work.”, 256)\n\n- **Psychotic episodes, hallucinations?** *(Probably the most important indicator – my prof thinks this is a perfect description of depression – which I doubt?)* (“When everything has been smooth and without painful incident for some time, when the tide has gone out too far, when Yvonne has been wandering along the street, looking with curiosity but no great interest at the lighting fixtures, the coral-encrusted bottles and the bridesmaid’s dresses, […], when she’s gone into the Donut Centre and sat down at the counter and seen the doughnuts under glass beneath her elbows, their tentacles drawn in, breathing lightly, every grain of sugar distinct, she knows that up on the hills, in the large suburban yards, the snakes and moles are coming out of their burrows and the earth is trembling imperceptibly beneath the feet of the old men in cardigans and tweed caps raking their lawns. She gets up and goes out, no faster than usual and not forgetting to leave a tip. She’s considerate of waitresses because she never wants to be one again. \nShe heads for home, trying not to hurry. Behind her, visible over her shoulder if she would only turn her head, and approaching with horrifying but silent speed, is a towering wall of black water. It catches the light of the sun, there are glints of movement, of life caught up in it and doomed, near its translucent crest.\nYvonne climbs the staris to her apartement, almost running, the two cats bounding up behind her, and hits the bed just as the blackness breaks over her head with a force that tears the pillow out of her her hands and blinds and deafens her. Confusion sweeps over and around her, but underneath the surface terror she is not too frightened. She’s done this before, she has some trust in the water, she knows that all she has to do is draw her knees up and close everything, ears, eyes, mouth, hands. All she has to do is hold on. Some would advocate that she let go instead, ride with the current, but she’s tried it. Collision with other floating objects does her no good. The cats jump on her head, walk on her, purr in her ear; she can hear them in a distance, like flute music on a hillside, up on the shore.\nYvonne can think of no reason for these episodes. There’s no trigger for them, no early warning. They’re just something that happens to her, like a sneeze. She thinks of them as chemical.”,  252f)\n\n-\t**Unable to deal with “situations”** (“She stopped [sleeping with this man] because of the impossibility of the situation.

She knew what she would say ahead of time to fend off those who might otherwise come looking for her, where she would go, which doors she would lock, where and in what position she would lie down; even, and not least importantly, what she would wear. She wanted her body to look well and not be too troublesome to those who would eventually have to deal with it. Clothed corpses are so much less disturbing than naked ones.\nBut lately she’s been forgetting much of this arcane knowledge. She should throw the pills out: they’ve become obsolete. She’s replaced them with something much simpler, more direct, faster, more failure-proof, and she’s been told, less painful. A bathtub full of warm water, her own bathtub in her bathroom she uses every day, and an ordinary razor blade, for which no prescriptions are necessary. The recommendation is that the lights be turned out, to avoid panic: if you can’t see the spreading red, you hardly know it’s there. A stinging in the wrists, like a minor insect. She pictures herself wearing a flannel night-gown, printed with small pink flowers, that buttons up to the neck. She has not yet bought this.”, 259f\n\n- **Rational thoughts against suicide** (“Yvonne hardly thinks about this razor blade and what it’s really doing in her paintbox. She is not obsessed with death, her own or anybody else’s. She doesn’t approve of suicide; she finds it morally distasteful.”, 260)\n\n- **otherwise a careful person** (“She keens a razor blade in her paintbox; it could be for slicing paper. In fact she does slice paper with it, and when it gets dull she replaces it. One side of the blade is taped, since she has no desire to cut her fingers by accident.”, 260; She takes care crossing the street, watches what she puts into her mouth, saves her money”, 260)\n\n- **In need of control** (“the razor blade is there all the time, underneath everything. Yvonne needs it there. What it means is that she can control her death; […] Perhaps the razor blade is only a kind of memento mori, after all.”, 260\n\n- **History of drug abuse** (“She’s no stranger to addiction, having once passed far too many chemical travelogues through her body, and she knows its dangers. As far as she’s concerned love is just another form of it.”, 254)\n-\t**Unstable relationships** (“her affairs with such men don’t last long.”, 254)\n\n_____\n\n**Learnt coping mechanisms** (“Yvonne has had to learn how to take care of herself; she didn’t always know.

She would like to write down instructions for herself and hand them over to someone else to be carried out, but despite several attempts on her part this hasn’t proved to be possible”, 247)\n\n-\t**Social contact** (“She doles out these lunches to herself like pills, at intervals, when she thinks she needs them. People living alone, she believes, get squirrelly if they go too long without human contact.”, 247)\n\n-\t**Ritual – watching the sunrise** (“In the summers, she takes to having afternoon naps, to make up for the sleep she loses to these dawn rituals. She hasn’t missed the sunrise for years; she depends on it. It’s almost as if she believes that if she isn’t there to see it there will be no sunrise at all. […] Yvonne […] holds on to the wooden railing to keep from lifting her arms as the sun floats up above the horizon, like a shimmering white blimp, an enormous kite whose string she almost holds in her hand. Light, chilly and thin but light, reaches her from it. She breathes it in.”, 261 (ending of the story))\n\n________\n\n**Mentions of madness**\n\n-\t“She really is a professional artist. She is not mad.”, 242 (explaining to models)\n\n-\t“Yvonne would very much like to draw him, but he’s far too crazy. She has a well-developed sense of self-protection, which must be why she hasn’t landed in serious trouble with any of the men she picks up. This man alarms her, not because she thinks he’s dangerous, but because he’s a little too much like what she could become.”, 244 (about a homeless man who talks to himself and looks like Beethoven)\n\n-\t“she sometimes worries that she’ll be one of those old women found dead in a pile of empty cat-food cans with a million dollars stashed in her sock.”, 246\n\n-\tMadwoman in the attic - Woolf recerence?

        "text": "In another sub I was talking about the first half of McEwan's Atonement.  Much of the narrative there is about the characters' memories.  However, McEwan keeps the focus on the \"now\" of the story - he doesn't present memories as scenes, he doesn't give sharp moment-by-moment detail of recollections.  The memories tend to be stated as summaries.  It's noticeable because for much of the time, there's nothing much going on - a character is taking a bath, or lying in bed.  Since the memories don't engage the reader as if they're something happening at the time of the novel, you're very aware you're reading about a small bit of time with characters not doing anything remarkable.  \n\nIs there any common terminology used in literary theory that distinguishes different \"flavors\" of narration?  Adjectives like \"immersive\", \"dramatized\", \"movie-like\" are all related to what I'm getting at - vs. \"summary\"\n\nEDIT: I'm not looking for the genre of Atonement.  I'm asking, is there terminology for the type of narrative - something more specific than \"close third person\" or similar.   I know John Gardner talked about the \"vivid and continuous dream\" as a laudable goal.  In Atonement - and also, for example, Moll Flanders - the author doesn't shoot for that - the narrative is of cognition and accomplished event, not of sensual perception or the details of events unfolding.  In Atonement, although lots events are revealed in the characters memories, they're \"told\", not \"shown\" - and I'm wondering if there is a widely used term that distinguishes the extremes of that spectrum.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/39pmns/does_this_example_fall_into_the_definition_of_a/",
        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just had some kind of argument about the nature of a pun. As you probably know, the phrase \"no pun intended\" is very common in Internet discussions to mark accidental puns in writing.\n\nNow to make a joke of this phrase, you can substitute this phrase by \"no pun indented\". Now the question that has arisen and led to an unexpectedly heated discussion was: Is this specifically a pun or just a word play? If it's only a word play, then which kind?\n\nFor me, the basic idea of a pun is that you have an apparent sentence that carries the primary meaning \"in plain sight\", but due to an ambiguity in either phonetics, spelling or idiomatics, it has a secondary meaning that carries humor or wit and is clearly overshadowed by the primary meaning. If the second meaning wasn't overshadowed by the primary one, then it would be a double entendre. Also, \"pun\" is not equivalent to \"word play\", but rather a subset.\n\nYou can also have a pun if the words are homophonic or very close, like this Wikipedia example: \"Question: Why do we still have troops in Germany? Answer: To keep the Russians in Czech\". In this example, the primary meaning depends on whether it is read or heared. If you read this sentence, then you have the primary meaning right before your eyes, then you also \"hear\" it when you read it in your head, so the secondary meaning becomes crystal clear, but is still secondary because of the chosen spelling. If you hear this sentence spoken, you would probably either not get the pun or even if you did, you would not assume that it was intended as a pun. Or you have additional context from the rest of the conversation to force the interpretation as \"Czech\" to be the primary meaning.\n\nNow the sentence \"No pun indented\" by itself is kind of idiosyncratic, and does not carry any fitting primary meaning. If you use \"no pun indented\" just in place of \"no pun intended\", I would not call this a pun, because the primary meaning is the one that is hidden and only accessible by playing with the language. At first I argued that his example would be a malapropism, but as far as I know (and from what I read on Wikipedia), characteristic for a malapropism is that the substitution of words is done non-intentionally.  \nBut if you construct a situation where \"no pun indented\" would be appropriate, then it should indeed be a pun, right?\n\nWhen I read up on the Wikipedia page on puns, I am not sure whether my casual not really rigorous \"definition\" that I carried non-explicitly in my head and that I tried to explain above is correct at all.\n\nSo to close, again my question in its essence: *Is \"no pun indented\" a pun or not?* If so, how would you distinguish between word play and puns because this distinction is not really clear for me after I read the definition on Wikipedia.\n\nThank you!",

Harold Bloom's taste is quite close to my taste, and his way of speaking about texts is always interesting to me, so I'm curious what school of thought he falls into.

Are there other scholars like Bloom who don't take a political/\"theory\" approach—someone like James Wood? Are there particular codes to look out for? I realize that Bloom is considered out-of-step with the gender/race/sexuality/Marxist style of scholarship currently in favor, but ideally I'd like to study Melville, Henry James, Frank O'Hara, Updike, Roth, James Merrill, Emerson, Whitman, Hardy, etc., and many French novelists (although, are French authors taught in English classes or in French-language classes?).",

I've always heard Shakespeare billed as the greatest writer of all time, the greatest English writer, etc.\n\nBut having specifically read\n\n&gt; The beauty of Shakespeare lies in the lines themselves. This is why I never advocate using something that paraphrases Shakespeare's works - paraphrase completely loses the genius by providing only one take on the lines. There are so many motifs that can be traced, so many clever double entendres (another mark of his genius is working under the constraints of a highly restrictive government and yet managing to win high favor of them as well as of the people), and so much raw emotion that rest in lines that may read completely ambiguously. There is never only one thing being said at any given line, and that's the importance of interpretation. I think one of the best talents the man had was his ability to write thousands of lines that provide millions of different stories depending on how they are presented on stage - that's why the conversation is still relevant: he wrote not only for his age but for our age by providing us with questions rather than answers.\n\nI started to wonder if scholars believe that a novelist such as this exists. Who would it be? Joyce? Tolstoy? Or is it all conjecture based on preference?\n\n",

Oe quite brilliantly manages to put his book in dialogue with western Authors such as Ernest Hemmingway, William Blake, Jean Paul Sartre, and Franz Kafka. Every reference I've looked into seems to parallel Bird's journey and his own problems. \n\n\nThe problem I'm having with the reference to Kafka is that I can't seem to find the quote he mentions. In A Personal Matter the main character, Bird, is sent to bring in Mr. Delchef, a diplomat from the Balkans, who has run off with a Japanese girl. Bird can't persuade him to return and in talking about how Bird is waiting for his baby to die Mr. Delchef responds with, \"Kafka, you know, wrote in a letter to his father, the only thing a parent can do for a child is welcome it when it arrives.\"\n\n\nI assumed this quote would have came from Kafka's famous Letter to his Father, but I've read the whole thing and it doesn't even appear to be a paraphrase from that letter. I can't find any other letters from Kafka to his father either, but the parallels between the letter I found and A Personal Matter seem to be pretty striking. Oe constantly seems to imply that Bird's desires have been influenced strongly by other people, cultures, and countries, to the point where they are no longer his own, and he can't quite tell where they came from anymore. Kafka's whole letter is about how all his thoughts and desires were practically thrusted upon him by his dad to the point where they aren't his anymore. \n\n\nIt really appears to me as if Oe meant to draw the reader to the letter. If so then why would the quote not be there? Every other scene and quote I looked up was easy enough to find (Hemmingway and Blake for instance). Does anyone else have any ideas, whether the quote is from? Another book, a diary, a letter of Kafkas? Or did Oe make the quote up, and if so why?\nI'd appreciate any help, I'm a little obsessed with tracking down these references, and this one has been bothering me for a while",

In short, I was looking to do a structural analysis, but ended up focusing more on a close reading. During my close reading I realized that Hegel's master-slave dialectic perfectly describes the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation, and I'm also looking to invoke it in order to explain Draculas move to London.\n\nMy question is basically as follows:\n\nDoes this make any sense? Does it make any sense to use this today? Is Hegel still used, does it have any flaws I should be aware of? Am I blind to use it simply as a model of thought?\n\nBest regards\nHansgreger",

Thank you.  If anyone has any further ideas, the more or less maximally specific description of what I'm hoping to find is someone who is piggybacking on a bunch of talk about justice to impress upon a bunch of people with what a good person he is.  I have in mind a sort of literary analogue of that facebook friend everyone has who takes every opportunity to post about, i.e. how outraged he is by a recent injustice, but is pretty transparently just taking advantage of the occasion to engage in some cheap talk that he hopes will make people think well of him.  He may be a hypocrite, or insincere, but not necessarily.  The feature I'm most interested in is using moral talk for personal publicity.",
