        "text": "I, 25F, identify as a bi woman, but in stereotypical bi fashion I almost exclusively only have experience with dating men. I don’t live in a location that lends itself handy to pursuing queer individuals, and I really want a partner, so I’m taking what I can get. It fluctuates in intensity, but I definitely identify as a misandrist. Sometimes it’s just “haha men can be silly sometimes but not all men I guess” and others it’s like I don’t understand why they exist and don’t want to associate with any of them. I’m currently in a spot that’s closer to the latter. I’ve been seeing a guy from a dating app for a little bit now. I want to break it off and I find a major reason is because I don’t want to keep seeing a man right now. I don’t want to ghost him, but I don’t know how to not sound like a complete asshole saying I don’t want to see him because he’s a man. I don’t really know how to handle it and any advice would be greatly appreciated\n\ntldr: how to dump a man because he’s a man",
