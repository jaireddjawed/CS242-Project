Except this time there is no sound at all. It is now a silent film. \n\nIt is a bold edit choice but is incredibly moving as it showed how much richer our films are through its absence.\n\nAll around it was a masterclass of an end. Even the titles felt bold in the silence.\n\nTurns out 10minutes before the end of the film my speakers died.\n\nDidn‚Äôt realise till the next day when I tried to watch something. Low and behold Babylon has a raucous sound design to the very last beat. It was not better for it. \n\nI absolutely loved the first film I saw and have been thinking about this weird small gift serendipity gave me.\n\nTLDR: I didn‚Äôt realise my speakers died in a movie about silent films and it made the film so much better.",

I don't tend to be as confident and outgoing when I'm just in a dialogue as I can't jump the conversation as well when managing it between 3 or 4 friends.

However, the scale on which I've been feeling it is insane, and a tiny bit frightening. \n\nIt's not just that a week passes and I'll say \"Oh, that went by fast\"; rather, I'll realize that it's March and that I'm no longer a young kid that doesn't have to worry about college applications and test scores (üôÑ). Seriously, I can almost pinpoint where I was six months ago, think about the elapsed time, and verbally exclaim in shock. \n\nAnd it's not just on a large scale--if anything, it's been more impactful on a smaller scale as well. Saying I have a free 30 minutes isn't the same as it was two years ago. It used to feel like I could fit an entire adventure in those 30 minutes--nowadays, it feels like I can untie my shoes and retie them, with very little time to spare. \n\nIt really does scare me quite a bit. I fear that if I close my eyes too long, I'll be graduated and working  a job, wondering where all the time went. Does this sound a bit like a mid-life crisis at the age of fifteen? I hope not.\n\nAnyways, just something that's been on my mind. Have any of you ever experienced this?",

Like the thought of putting pressure on them when chewing and it pushing up into my gums gives me anxiety. I know that sounds pretty ridiculous. I think it's because I know my real teeth don't act that way and feel like they have an actual base to them that goes up way further, where as I'm scared that pressure on these temporary crowns is just jamming them into my gums and I don't know how high they even have room to go up there. I don't know if I'm scared it's gonna hurt or just the idea of them pressing into my gums with any kind of force is what's scaring me.\n\nMy gums are still a bit sore from getting the temp crowns so I've been mostly eating food you don't have to chew much. I want to move onto more solid foods though (nothing super hard like chips or anything). Does anyone have any advice about this? I can't chew on the other side of my mouth so I'd really like to get over this fear if I can.",

        "text": "I broke up with my ex-girlfriend about 7 months ago. It wasn't something we wanted, but we were really long distance (14 hours apart). Things were getting busier at work, and we both had our fair share of problems. It got to the point where the relationship was making us more unhappy than happy. As many of you may know, sometimes, you don't break up because you want to but rather because you have to. We talked through it at the time and both agreed that that was the right choice for us and haven't talked since then (I apologize, but I won't get into details as to why. I hope you understand).\n\nOver time, the emotions settled, and I was able to get back to how my life was before I'd met my girlfriend. But, recently, my YouTube feed fed me a song we used to always listen to together. Man, music was something that helped us to feel like we were close, despite being halfway across the world from each other. They made us feel warm and the lyrics and melodies made our thoughts of each other almost tangible. That said, last night, I did something really stupid. I fell down the hole of listening to our songs, one after the other, and, man... I don't think I've ever felt this sad. I feel so vulnerable, and I'm honestly at a loss. God, I miss her so much.\n\nShe gave me a reason to want to work harder than ever before. I'd always wake up to her texts and go to sleep to the sound of her voice. We made so many exciting plans together. My days were so black and white before she came in and added color. Now, that's all gone, almost like a dream. This whole day, I've been asking myself why I'd even let myself fall for her. God, I regret it all so much, but, at the same time, they're such precious memories, and I don't want to let go of them. I'm sorry for getting all poetic on you. I'm going through a tornado of complicated emotions and don't know what to do with them. I'd appreciate any advice from anyone who can empathize. Even if you don't, if you read to this point, it means a lot. Thank you.",

We made some more small talk , and then she asked me how old I am. I told her I‚Äôm 23 and asked her to be honest and tell me  how old she thought I was . She said she thought I was 26, and I told her thats not bad , most people think I‚Äôm 30 or older because of my shaved hair. She said I can see how they would think that because the beard and the shaved her made me look older, then she asked me why I dont grow out my hair. I said I have a shitty hairline and I dont like the way my hair looks. She said ‚Äú noo , you look cute.‚Äù I said ‚Äúdo I ? ‚Äú . She said yes and smiled and then just kind of walked away.

I see way more younger white American, Canadian, European, and Australian \"influencers\", for example, show pictures of Indian festivals, trips to India, or Indian foods, for example, then they do for countries such as Japan, Korea, Thailand, Morocco, Egypt, Mexico, or Peru. For China, even if it is also less visited by them, they still seem to take a strong interest in Chinese culture, as shown by their frequent pictures from local Chinatowns and Chinese restaurants.\n\nWondering if there are any teen and 20-something Westerners who hold India and Indian culture with roughly equal regard/interest as other countries are held. If not, is it because Indian culture is considered less \"cool\" by young people than Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Middle Eastern, or Latino cultures? Or is is simply less familiarity with Indian culture? Does expressing interest in visiting India evoke strong disapproval and red flags among young people that many other countries do not? Are there ANY positives about India from the perspective of young people today?",

So for the animated version of it this time I decided to use My own ideas of the fight scene this time and I did. But it still kinda feels to similar to the fight scene I copied in the show I've watched. Like I didn't trance over the art this time, I used different character movements (like attacks for example) this time, and a completely different dialogue too this time. But for example, if the fight in the show I've watched has a few seconds of fighting then there is a pause for character dialgue then back to the fight then the fight ends, my animation is the same way like that. So again I didn't copy or trace the art, It has completely different lines, and different angles and movement. But still feels the same in the way I explained. If your confused and need more of an example let me know. \nBut what do you guys think, is it still a copy or is it fine the way it is?",

        "text": "My fianc√© and I have been together for nearly 9 years, and I just took in I have been a horrible partner to him. We met when we were 20 years old in university and he has been a rock for me throughout the past 9 years. He has been raising several issues the past two months that I only came to understand now given it is the last straw. I haven't been listening and fulfilling his needs and he has said I haven't done much for him in the past few years. He quit his corporate job and founded a start up and I didn't really understand what that meant till it happened. I was constantly nagging him about our future and in turn had a negative effect on him. To add to all this I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 10 years and in my head I thought that if I work on myself it will be better for our relationship. We have tried couples therapy and I have gone to therapy as well but it doesn't seem to work.\n\nHe has been there for me through it all and has always been a shoulder to lean on, whereas I can't say the same for him. I have poor listening skills cause I feel like I am constantly anxious and so I don't process things he is saying and in turn am not fulfilling what he needs in me. For people who have depression and anxiety what are some strategies you have done to be a better partner?",

Its going very very slowly, 2 of my friends have stopped contributing and I think I've pissed off the last one because we need to develop the story still and all the power is on me to do so.\n\nThen I worked on music for it and an older friend said it's 'trying to sound real but it's shit fake'. A guy this morning was angry and telling me i should research the basics of programming when reviewing my code. Then in general people have just been mean and it just takes my day away from me.\n\nI'm going to bed now, i dont feel happy and idk if i feel sad but I have work. I'll see you tomorrow.",

It felt authentic and real and personable. Nowadays they are pretty much TV shows at this point.\n\nAnd I feel like the nature of the vlog just feels weird when you realize at all times, there are like 3 cameramen just silently recording them while these youtubers pretend that they don't exist lmao.",
