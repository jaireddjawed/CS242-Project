        "text": "Shirkers has been with Sandi Tan for over twenty years. Well, let’s take a step back—that’s not entirely true. For many years it was held captive from its creator. This is the story about an idealistic, punk filmmaker from Singapore reclaiming their art from the man who stole their dreams.\n\nShirkers is a fun sell, a documentary where the premise delivers the goods. You’re going to get to see Sandi’s long-missing project intercut with the story about what happened. What happened is her mentor Georges took away with the film she wrote when it was nearing completion, leaving everyone involved with nothing to show for their years of work. Throughout the years, Sandi would find echoes of her project in fragments of pop culture, like Ghost World, and would believe her ideas were still alive, out there somewhere seeping into other media.\n\nThe essence of the film would be that Sandi would create a kind of reverse slasher flick where a woman goes about and brings men home before killing them off with her weapon of choice—finger guns. The leftover footage is cute and bright, clearly from the mind of an adolescent, but it charms and reflects a filmic background. She thought it would be nice to have a giant dog, so an oversized wolf of a dog was put in. The choices are filled with a remarkable glee and inner fascination with what was interesting to shoot.\n\nWe must understand where Sandi’s coming from. In Singapore, there wasn’t anything so much like another slasher film being made. These influences came from the author’s great background of our Western cult classics, brought into the imagery of her perspective.\n\nThere are still Sandi’s fingerprints all over not only the original work but this documentary. Any time an animal roams on set, it’s sure to be included. A cat scares one interviewee mid-sentence, and you can feel the sureness that it would be included here. Sandi’s eclectic mind never left her aims of delivering fun, provocative cinema. She has just matured into a stylish documentarian of her unique perspective. We genuinely can’t help but fall a bit in love with Shirkers, when we see how devoted she is to her punk ideals.\n\nIt’s somewhat of a sad, weird story too. The film was pretty much complete, and Georges dropped off the map completely. Some of the film is spent following his tracks but to varying degrees of success. We find a trail of other people he’s screwed over but not before having them buy into his visions. He’d propose seemingly new concepts—like a setpiece for Shirkers which Sandi would later find out is copied right out of Paris, Texas’ sidewalk scene. He’d tell everyone who’d listen that he’s the inspiration for James Spader’s character in Sex, Lies and Videotape. It was one of his close associates who was actually involved on the set. He’d take jealousy and entitlement and divert it onto the creations of others, believing something so wonderful and inventive should be his own. Like his make-believe Soderberghian counterpart, Georges wasn’t interested in women for sex, but made advances on these young women anyway. My greatest frustration with Shirkers is we never find any conclusions about the man or especially what ever motivated any of this.\n\nThe revelation of Shirkers is that found footage is now an authentic genre. This Netflix produced documentary is an absolute treat for festivals, fitting in naturally with the North Bend Festival’s status quo of rebellious outsider creations. There is little as rebellious as this fantastic woman reclaiming her art from this man who stole her dreams and repackaging the story for our entertainment. Sandi Tan should be acclaimed as a folk punk hero.\n\n*Shown as a centerpiece for the North Bend Film Festival, coming to Netflix in late October*\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/28/north-bend-film-festival-shirkers/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/28/north-bend-film-festival-shirkers/)",

        "text": "It sounds counter-intuitive, I know...but I can't help but feel that way. This is my opinion- \n\nBoth films have differences, undeniably so. You have a distinct style for both films...because mike leigh and scorsese are auteurs of this field...but that's not the point...I'm strictly talking from a subjective point of view...that despite these differences  the films for me evoke some kind of sameness...I want to understand what this sameness constitutes of ....\n\nIn terms of taxi driver, the disdain is clear...he has returned from war; clearly he has seen things and it has had an effect on him so much so he can't sleep at night. What does he do? He drives taxi around at night...and tries to have a romantic stable relationship to trickle back to the idea of a stable social life. The latter does not work; and things escalate and he forms this radical views about the wretchedness of the society; the society for which he almost gave his life in the war. Add to that viewpoint his sense of loneliness, lack of sleep and the carefully blended influence of his night life...and so begins his descent towards lack of mental stability...\n\nIn terms of Naked however, things are dark from the very get go...the film begins with protagonist raping a girl in an alley...but he gets away with it (from which you get an idea of the world immediately)...he manages to convince his ex gf (and fuck her brutally later) to let him stay at her place even though the ex-gf is clearly not that well-off either...gradually the film delves into its main themes, as we see the protagonist delve into an existential rant that would make kierkegaard weep tears of a proud mentor...The guy is clearly an intellectual...he talks enough about homer and clearly conscious enough to look down upon inferior beings...which suggests that he should be somewhere higher in the society- at least not a bum, who has to hitchhike through homes...anyway, that's the character we get and the film develops then by portraying this character against his conflicts with society ...which is to say along the same lines of taxi driver.\n\nI think this is the point where the two films become similar...difference being in taxi driver the aggression is more direct..the character travis wants direct results because he believes his actions will have result...in clear contrast to this, the character in naked, johny is clearly uninterested in all of that...so uninterested he doesn't even do anything (which might also suggest other things such as the lack of institution within society)....in naked, this aggression ends up being passive aggressive...And i know, his problems are existential, but the source of his existentialism clearly rooted in the conflict against the societal values (very similar to taxi driver)...Naked in that sense is the result of a more postmodernist approach as there is no resolve...the film ends in a dangling fashion with IMO one of the best and most haunting endings ever...but take the postmodernist approach of naked away, and you get a british version of taxi driver with the unique film making style of mike leigh...",

        "text": "Video version of this post:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvI-jVMJioc\n\n\nThe beginning of Sexy Beast sees Gal, Deedee, Aitch and Jackie living out their retirement in sunny Spain, having left behind their criminal lives back in England. Their peace is about to be shattered however, by the arrival of the volatile sociopathic Don Logan, an old crime associate who is part of a team preparing for a heist, and is intent on recruiting the reluctant Gal. They wait for the inevitable arrival of the man no-one wants around them.\n\nIn a classic case of art imitating life, Ray Winstone and co. actually had to wait for Ben Kingsley to turn up to set, as a movie he was working on ran over-schedule and the actor arrived late. Winstone was apprehensive at Kingsley’s casting as the terrifying role of Logan, and he mentioned in interviews think Ghandi’s going to turn up. When Kingsley did turn arrive however, he did so in character, and genuinely terrified his cast mates.\n\nThe Oscar nominated performance of Kingsley needs no additional praise, as many consider it to be his finest performance. The entire film relies on him delivering a knockout, and critics called him “riveting”, “brilliant”, “astonishing”, “exceptional”, “a tour de force”, and “show-stopping.” After watching the movie for the first time, it takes a great deal of effort after being blown away by his performance to remember that Sexy Beast is an all-round great film, with a fantastic script and exceptional acting from the entire cast.  \n\nIt’s not just that Kingsley formed such an unhinged and frightening character, but he added layers to Don Logan that are apparent without the need for exposition or even any dialogue whatsoever. Even before he arrives the apprehensiveness of the characters is telling. Right off the bat, seeing him walk down the airport with that shiny bald head, you know this guy is going to make a difference to the film one way or another. Immediately upon getting out of the car, he is as forward and offensive in conversation as he is in life.\n\nWith a lot of these kind of people, their rude behaviour is nothing more than a showcase that they are quite simply sociopaths. They have no shame, no guilt and see no fault in their actions. Don does many ill-mannered for no reason, like pissing on the floor, but also, if anything, Don’s violent personality, his invasive attitude towards others is a coating, a masking of his inner insecurities. His temperament and ferociousness is how he gets what he wants. He uses this to get Gal to join the heist, but funnily enough, he fails. Don examines Gal’s lifestyle, and he’s disgusted, sees it as a betrayal of whatever misguided sense of honour he follows – he can’t even look when seeing that Gal has a Spanish boy help him with chores around the house. Nevertheless he continues, but Gal stands his ground throughout the film. Despite being almost driven to tears, Gal technically has the upper hand as along as he does not give Logan what he wants, or at least he does until Don actually loses the plot. Don attempts to intimidate Gal from the off but after he is met with refusal, he has no plan B. There is no follow up, he doesn’t know any other way, no other method of persuasion, so all he does is what he can do – up the tempo. Be even more intimidating. And with Gal refusing every time the question comes up, all Don can do, like a child, is shout even louder.\n\nDon seems the juvenile type that seems to fancy himself as some kind of military captain. Certain expressions he comes out with, and the humorous way he punches Gal in mid conversation and then stands back calmly, hands behind his back, standing straight and firm like an officer, as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. You get a lot of these sort of people hanging around the pubs of the UK, who feed their own idealistic images of themselves in their heads with actions which are, to everyone else around them, reprehensible and immature. They are the heroes in their stories, and everyone else is a villain. He’s unable to even perform introspection without resorting to violence and a tirade of profanity. He talks to himself in the mirror like an old uncle, giving the worst possible advice and feeding the already-manifesting problematic thoughts Don is having, the kind of uncle that’s done the rounds in prison and never amount to anything, one that your parents have always told you to stay away from. He claims that the characters are all taking the piss out of him, when only seconds before he sees that they are all sleeping blissfully.\n\nDon’s rage, driven by his insecurities, are most-likely amplified by the fact that he himself exposed them in the first place. In a rare moment of sincerity, Don tells Gal he had feelings for Jackie, who’s now with Aitch. He also lets slip some intimate information about their previous bedroom life, information that suggests Don could or could not enjoy having his behind stimulated. Naturally, this infuriates him even further.\n\nThese slips become more apparent as the film progresses. When Don unleashes yet another tirade, this time in the kitchen against Gal, Gal says he’s had enough with the old life, that he’s happy here. Don screams, almost in tears himself by the look of it “I won’t let you be happy, why should I?” After this brief unmasking, he immediately diverts attention back to the heist, delivering arguably his loudest rant of the film.\n\nThe line “I won’t let you be happy, why should I?” is one I always felt Don wasn’t supposed to say to Gal. He had no intention of letting Gal know that one of the reasons for coming to Spain was so that he could see Jackie again. Don can see that the four friends are happy, that they are set, and he knows he can’t have that, that he’s missed his train, he’s missed Jackie. He sees Gal’s happy, and he resents him for it. And when Gal exposes Don mere minutes later, saying this is not all about the job but also Jackie, Don is so distraught by this exposure he literally books a taxi and leaves the country. Or at least tries to.\n\nAnother slip is during his final rage. Here he’s really losing it, having been unable to convince Gal, and just being all round embarrassed that he’s failed to achieve any of his goals, including those regarding Jackie, and in his mind the four must be laughing at him while he takes off back to England. He aims shots at everyone, including and especially Jackie, who he must have acknowledged by now is completely beyond his grasp. And when Aitch asks whether there was something wrong with the plane, Don lays it all bare. Since he is now with Jackie, as Don puts it “You’re the problem. You’re the fucking problem.”\n\nThe plane scene was quite interesting, because it shows what Don is like away from the characters he is used to. It’s all good and all being a despicable creature in and among your social associates but in public, Don makes no effort to adjust himself, threatening passengers and being offensive to the staff. I wonder if this is Don in his normal state, whether he was still furious over the events at Gal’s house, or whether he never even intended to leave Spain. I don’t think Don is the type to make a plan to leave and then return as some kind of “Surprise!” revenge plot, he just really had nowhere else to go after being kicked off of the flight, and could now direct all his hate and rage to the people who he was choosing to blame for all his problems.\n\nAs the movie shows us though, in the grand scheme of things, Don is nothing. When we are introduced to Ian McShane’s Teddy, whose calm, delicate persona is akin to a horror movie villain, the devil himself, Don Logan seems like nothing more than he actually is, or is considered by those around him – a mad dog, one who was let off his leash in Spain and never came back. And no-one misses him.\n\nI remember seeing an interview with Ben Kingsley when he says Logan was abused as a child, and the line “I won’t let you be happy, why should I?” is a reflection of him being abused as a child, having never been healed, and now going onto abuse others. Whether you accept that stance or not is up to you, but either way, there’s clearly more to Don than meets the shiny bald head.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9axi22/slender_man_could_be_one_of_the_worst/",
        "text": "Let me preface by saying they got nothing in Slender Man right. The whole film is dark and desaturated for no reason, and they even went as far as reducing natural light in daytime scenes so the film looks consistently dark, and making sure to go out of their own way to make night-time sequences really hard to watch because you can't see anything. Most of the framing makes no sense; you have odd close-up shots where characters having a conversation will be missing parts of their face, even if it's them talking. On top of that, characters literally keep disappearing which makes the film hard to follow. Both the main girls \"disappear\" and are never heard of again after the ten minutes of mentioning they get, shit, an entire love interest character disappears. Before I go on, I'm going to outline some things and from this point on, it's just spoilers.\n\nSlender Man is about how four teenage friends watch a cursed video online, clearly inspiring such classic films as Ringu, which leads to the summoning of Slender Man. For whatever reason, the red-headed girl Katie disappears and the girls decide to take part in a ritual to bring her back... This involves a completely different summoning ritual for whatever reason, whereby they have to give up something they love. The three girls blindfold themselves and because Claire, the token black friend, takes her blindfold off out of fear, her friends decide to do this as well even though they were told earlier doing this exposes them to Slender Man, and drives them insane. This is essentially the plot of the film.\n\nSo, Claire actually has a death scene in the trailer but she's never mentioned again after some characters keep saying shit like \"she's ill\", or \"she has a cold\" and making all kinds of other excuses for whatever reason. Katie no longer has anything to do with the plot. The film ends up revolving around main characters being picked off, even if it makes no sense for this to happen to them. Hallie, another one of the main girls, sees her sister being driven mad by Slender Man, even though this makes no sense. She didn't watch the video, nor did she partake in any ritual, so why is she afflicted? In case most of this sounds random, it's worth mentioning the film doesn't even have a story, it's a sequence of nonsense. Even in the worst films I have ever seen, films like The Room, or Uninvited, or Surf Nazis Must Die, or Samurai Cop, there's fleshed-out characters, a real plot and story and meaningful things going on. Slender Man neglects all of this because apparently meme-name-value already makes the film great.\n\nThe film has some of the worst production I've ever seen. Slender Man as a CG creation looks terrible, like he was made in Source Filmmaker. Even the surreal horror sequences look really, really fake. It's impossibly funny watching a girl I forgot the name of turn into a tree at the end of the film because not only is this not established but it looks really cheap and shitty. The colour correction is some of the worst I have ever seen in a film, the film looks genuinely hideous and not in a good way. Disgusting-looking horror films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have artistic reasons to look gritty and grungy like they do but Slender Man looks like they turned the contrast down on a Disney Channel original movie. I'll also add that nothing in the film is remotely scary. The sound design is so bad and the editing is so appalling that even the jump scare cues are clearly way, way off. There's no good timing in the whole film and because of it, the film lacks any horror. Nothing scares you and you won't even be jolted by loud noises. I could just play Slender: The Eight Pages because that actually manages to do the horror thing properly.\n\nIt's not as offensive as The Book of Henry, not as wacky as The Space Between Us, not as boring as All Eyez On Me, not as batshit crazy as Jupiter Ascending, so as far as I'm concerned, Slender Man doesn't even have entertainment value. Truth or Dare came out earlier this year and even though that film isn't nearly as bad as this, it's so much funnier. There's no fucking way anybody in the right mind would be able to recommend Slender Man, I don't even understand why so many people on IMDB defend it, it's such an awful film. ",

In particular, the infinite/ portal scene. The imagery on this size screen made you feel like Dave going through that experience.\nMaybe this belongs in r/fixingmovies but I thought I would ask here first. In the portrayal of images it starts as lines of color and gives you the perspective of flying towards one point. It then transitions to mostly images of color lines against black, appearing to get distorted. Some look like the inside of a lava lamp. They all give me the idea of the farthest reaches of space and things unknown. With the music, I honestly feel this is one of the most horrifying scenes in cinema.\nThen, it ends. That amazing feeling of dread and unknown is cut short because the next images we see are that of earth. Just earth with color filters. Going from distorted images that induced genuine fear, to earth which is comforting after seeing everything else.\nSo the question is, was there a specific reason to show images of earth during this scene?\nIf not I personally believe these should be cut and replaced with more fantastical and horrifying images.

The “feminine gaze” is quite obvious at times with its admiration of the perfectly toned male body but honestly it’s quite refreshing and done very tastefully. Even the undertones of homosexuality, that is the catalyst to the plot by disturbing the all-important order, seemed natural and not forced. More like the inevitable effect of keeping testosterone filled, beautiful men together for long periods of time and the jealousy that comes from such strict heirarchical systems. Was not expecting anything like this because I didn’t know anything like this existed, mainly because I always saw this kind of regimented life as life-killing.\n\nThe narration is obviously very existential and as a civilian, the main character regrets his time as a legionnaire but I think that the movie is trying to say that while he was a legionnaire he had purpose and that now he no longer has that discipline in his life he is lost. A unique take on the transition from military life to civilian life. Nothing to do with  the usual treatment of the subject which is almost exclusively focused on PTSD.",

I understand that it was a commercial failure, but that hasn’t stopped many other films from being appreciated after the fact, so why is this movie viewed so negatively?",

        "text": "Video Form: [https://youtu.be/aF7OhXMXNbc](https://youtu.be/aF7OhXMXNbc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2001: A Space Symphony\n\nPerhaps no other film continues to be as enigmatic as Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ultimate science fiction film. Undeniably epic in scope and riddled with mystic symbolism, 2001 operates on a level much closer to abstract art than a traditional film, without the reliance on words, as the film contains no dialogue for roughly the first and last 20 minutes. The language of Kubrick’s masterpiece is an elegant dance of music and images, of complex concepts and abstractions. Together, they build a beautiful bridge connecting experimental and traditional plot driven films, an experience unlike any other in cinema.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKubrick originally hired Alex North, a celebrated Hollywood composer, to write an original score for the film. It wasn’t until the New York screening of the film that he found out that Kubrick decided to reject his original score in favor of already existing classical music. This must have been incredibly frustrating for the composer, but Kubrick definitely made the right choice. North’s score is very reminiscent of the big historical films of the 50’s and 60’s; some of which were actually scored by North himself, including Kubrick’s Spartacus. It evokes classic Hollywood music and feels dated as of today. On the other hand, opting for classical music makes 2001 unique and isn’t reminiscent of any particular Hollywood era. In other words, it makes the film timeless. Another good reason for opting out of using North’s score was that like all traditional movie soundtracks, it tries to give emotional cues. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this approach to movie scoring, most great films have done it. However, Kubrick wanted to transcend traditional techniques of narrative cinema and provoke the audience to self-reflect about the meaning behind it all: Our place in the universe and our relationship with technology. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe film opens in complete blackness with Ligeti’s Atmospheres, an overture to set the mood. There’s something dark, yet beautifully epic about this piece. It fulfills its purpose, which is to prepare us for the experience that is about to take place. Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the famous piece of orchestral music sets up a cyclical structure within the film. The symphonic poem is played three times in the movie: The first time it is heard comes during the alignment of the Moon, Earth and Sun - a phenomenon representing a new stage in human evolution: The Dawn of Man. The second time it’s played comes when early man learns how to use tools, an event symbolizing the achievement of human consciousness. During the final scene of the film, as David Bowman becomes the Star-Child, the tone poem is heard one last time. These three occasions constitute the completion of a full cycle, as each represent a new stage of human evolution, a sign of a new beginning. There’s a philosophical connection between the film and the music: Friedrich Nietzsche’s novel, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which Strauss used for inspiration to compose the music, speaks of an Ubermensch, a superman. For Nietzsche, this concept was the evolution of a human being into a superior being that would achieve his full potential. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe appearance of the monolith is always accompanied by Ligeti’s Requiem. A strange piece of music scored for soprano, mezzo-soprano, mixed chorus and orchestra. The piece borderlines between musicality and unusual noises, which presents the monolith as a higher order of intelligence beyond our ability to comprehend. Just like a foreign language would sound like babbling to us, the monolith also represents technology far beyond our current capabilities. After an ape uses a bone to kill another ape, he throws it in the air; the film then cuts to an orbiting satellite. The famous match cut draws a connection between the two objects as contrasting primitive and advanced tools, to demonstrate humanity’s technological progress. Another notable piece of music is introduced: The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss. In an attempt for Kubrick to get as far away from cliched science fiction themes, the waltz flows smoothly and the motion of spaceship and station synchronize elegantly with the pace of the music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe’ve already established that music is the language of 2001: A Space Odyssey, so it’s only natural that it would give the film a certain structure. Taken individually, the pieces of music would have little meaning, but in the larger context of the film they each represent an important part of the movie’s composition. In a very unusual movie, David Bowman is the character who most closely resembles a typical main character in a film. His passage through the Stargate and Beyond the Infinite is the closest thing we get to a hero’s journey, but since conventional narration isn’t a part of 2001, his path can’t be confined to specific events. Instead, his journey is represented by the psychedelic experience that is the Stargate. Just like Ligeti’s Requiem which plays along the sequence, the images presented to Bowman and to the viewer are beautiful, yet strangely disturbing and indecipherable: They hold no meaning for unenlightened eyes. The combination of music, bizarre colors and patterns play perfectly together to represent uncharted territory, beyond our comprehension. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey is the rare movie that transcends its genre, generation and even cinema itself. Just as a beautiful painting or an enchanting piece of music without explanation from the author, 2001 is a movie that will be forever analyzed, but never fully understood. It’s a film that’s meant to be experienced, rather than seen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"A film is – or should be – more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.\" - Stanley Kubrick\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo Form: [https://youtu.be/aF7OhXMXNbc](https://youtu.be/aF7OhXMXNbc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "For those who are unaware, Alice Guy Blaché is the first female director and she was there at the birth of cinema. I want to write a series of posts in dedication to her. This first post will be a summary of her life to provide some background on her. After this, I want to work my way through some of her extensive filmography and discuss both technical aspects and the films themselves. I'll try to only discuss films that are accessible on YouTube so people who are unfamiliar with her works can watch and discuss. I'll mostly be using films that are available in Flicker Alley's Early Women Filmmakers box set, but might select some other films that are important. I hope to further my film analytical skills, expose people to her works who do not know her, and to hopefully have some in depth film discussions. \n\nA little background on me for those curious, I am a college student who is a Film Studies Minor and a been a fan of film for a long time. This subject is something that I've independently studied on my own, so if there are any inaccuracies or anything you feel should be added, please point it out! Also if you guys have any critiques of my writing, I'd love to hear it. I'm a Psychology student so I'm used to writing and reading scientific papers so a lot of this is (relatively) new to me.\n\n-\n\n**Alice Guy Blaché**\n-\n\nAlice Guy Blaché was not only the first female director, but she was also most likely the only female director from 1896 to 1906. Along with helping to pave the way for succeeding women filmmakers, she also was at the head of the curve and pioneered many technical advances in filmmaking and she explored and brought several feminist ideas to the silver screen as well. She was incredibly progressive for her time and had a huge part in cinematic history; despite being largely ignored by film historians for being a woman.\n\nAlice Guy Blaché was born in 1873 in Saint-Mandré, France as Alice Ida Antoinette Guy. Following her father’s death, she learned to be a typist and a stenographer in order to support her and her mother. In 1894, she began working as a typist at a company called 'Comptoir général de la photographie', which was a camera manufacturing and supply company. Shortly after, the company was taken over by a handful of men, one of them being Léon Gaumont. Guy and Gaurmont ended up attending the first ever film screening in 1895, where the Lumière brothers publically debut their projector in 1895. Guy was fascinated with the invention, but felt like it could be used for more than just for scientific or educational purposes. Instead, she thought that one could weave a fiction narrative into the film and she asked Gaurmont to allow her to do just that.\n\nIn 1896, she released her first film, which is now unfortunately lost, called Le Fée aux Choux. This film is arguably the first narrative film ever. I was interested in this claim, so I googled “what was the first narrative film?” and the first, and most common answer, was Edwin S. Porter’s 1903 film The Great Train Robbery. This film came out 5 years after Guy released Le Fée aux Choux and she received no credit. In the search there was a link to an article titled “The Great Train Robbery Was Not the First Narrative Film” for a website called Medium in 2017. This article points out that Guy’s film and the Lumière film The Waterer Watered. According to the author, The Waterer Watered allegedly came out in 1895, but there is no evidence of such. It’s great to see that she is slowly starting to get the recognition she deserves for her contributions.\n\nFollowing this, she went on to make close to 600 silent films ranging from one minute to thirty minutes, most being single reel films. From 1896-1907, Guy was head of Gaumont’s film production in Paris. She married Hebert Blaché, another Gaurmont employee, and the Blaché’s ended up moving to the United States to start a Gaumont Chronophone franchise, which was a method of adding synchronized sound to film. This soon failed and they moved to New York where Hebert was put in charge of a studio in Flushing, Queens. Guy took this opportunity to start up her own company, which she named Solax in 1910. She then started working on a large number of films and was so financially successful that the Blaché’s moved into a large house together.\n\nSoon things began to fall apart when Gaurmont pulled out of the United States in 1914 as a result of the war and the Blachés ended up opening their own company together called Blaché Features. The Blachés took turns directing feature length films, as short films had fallen out of style by this time. However in 1920, the Blachés got a divorce and Guy decided to move back to France. For the next thirty years, she lectured on film, wrote magazine fiction and wrote novelizations of film scripts. Even later in life, Guy remained fascinated with narratives. She never ended up remarrying and unfortunately never made another film, until she died in 1968 at the age of 94. Truly, she was an amazing woman and was there, quite literally, at the birth of cinema and she helped form it to be what it is today with her interest in film narratives.",

        "text": "French film from the 1960's to the 1990's was so incredibly different and ahead of it's time; so innovative and introspective that the world couldn't go without noticing. There were dozens and dozens of extremely renowned filmmakers from that period all doing incredibly new and interesting things. I don't even think I need to elaborate on here how influential French New Wave cinema was but that same momentum extended even past that period into the 70's, 80's, and even early - mid 90's. \n\nHowever, I feel like French film has gone flat (with a few expections of course) within the last decade or so. So many more modern films I've seen use very similar cinematography, rehash the same themes and overall just don't stand out in the same ways or even come close. Two of the most heavily praised, award-winning films such as *The Intouchables* and *The Class* literally just retold stories that had already been told in film so many times before. *Un Couteau Dans La Coeur* in competition at Cannes this year was shallow and poorly received overall. Even just looking at lists of Best 21st Century French Films in IMDb I find the names I recognize (even those towards the top of the list) to be entirely forgettable and so many films that didn't really amount to much. \n\nAm I generalizing too much or does anyone else feel this way? I feel that French films from the second half of the 20th century were very open into diving into political and philosophical themes (pretty much every Cahiers du Cinema director), experimenting with different cinematography techniques and fantastical sets (all the way from Tati to Jeunet), exploring feminist themes in a completely new way (Chantal Ackerman and Agnes Varda), just to name a few. These filmmakers had such distinct styles and voices despite being clumped together into the sme movements. French cinema in the last decade or two seems to have become much more commercial and strays away from experimentation (again, don't get me wrong, there are a few standout movies which this doesnt apply to). What is causing this shift, or is there even a shift happening?\n\nWould love to open this up to discussion and hear what you all think. ",

Aside from his fun stories, his characters often get caught up in time loops, and explore landscapes that seem to exist in a nightmare. Are there any films similar to _Inland Empire_, _TPFWWM_, or even Adrian Lyne's _Jacob's Ladder_ that depict a paranoid dreamscape, and have left an impact on you in their portrayal?",

Well, that is* *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl.*\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ruixc5uhtii11.jpg\n\n**E**arlier this week I got to experience the limited nationwide run of *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl* in a sold-out theatre. It brings me great pleasure to say it was one of my favorite watches of the year and will definitely be a film I talk about for FilmEra’s best of the year articles. That being said, this film is so over the top that it blows my mind it is able to maintain a coherent story. Like the film, this review may bounce all over the place, but by the end it should all come to together. I truly wish I could go into detail about all the events in this film and how they made me feel but this is one of those films that you want to avoid as many spoilers as possible. The trailer does a great job at only showing you the first part of the film before it kicks it up a notch.\n\nI went completely blind into *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl—*directed by Masaaki Yuasa and based on the novel of the same name written by Tomihko Morimo. I have only experienced one of the director’s work, which left me completely messed up for a few days: [**Devilman: Crybaby**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/01/25/devilman-crybaby/). As you can tell I was expecting another crazy adventure from Yuasa and did he deliver. *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl* is at heart a romantic comedy between an upper-class university student (Senior) and his underclassman (Junior) whom he has a massive crush on. Throughout one night that feels like a year, we experience the Junior’s adventure as she takes on adulthood, and the Senior’s mission to claim her heart no matter what.\n\n The film wastes no time jumping into crazy shenanigans, but of course it is to be expected given the central characters. For example, there is a character introduced within the first fifteen minutes who refuses to change his underwear until he meets the love of his life (I am not joking).  That is only a small portion because as soon as the characters leave the wedding reception, the night truly begins. We soon learn as our heroine enters a bar that she has a large obsession with drinking, till the point she goes on a long monologue about how much she can drink. \n\n \n\nJust when you think this film is about hardcore drinking and bar hopping, it changes gears. For you see, *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl* captures all four seasons of a year in one night, and with each season comes a completely new dilemma. When I tell you this is a pure delight of a film, take my word for it, as I couldn’t stop smiling as the crazy antics these characters got involved in. There is one part of the film that stands out as my favorite: the scene is basically a ten minute long musical chalked full with crazy revelations that made my sold out theatre erupt in laughter.\n\nWhat makes it such an wonderful watch is how all the characters intertwine with each other and end up forming this amazing bond that lasts one night. Complete strangers come together to share their life stories, happiness, and fears. Just when you think you have them figured out, they reveal a secret about themselves that you didn’t expect. There is an older character who is worried he didn’t leave an impact on anyone in his life, but our heroine breaks down, indicating he has affected everyone within the city without even realizing it. This struck a chord with me because sometimes we forget in life how much of an impact we have on others, no matter how short of a time we are in their lives.\n\n \n\nI have to applaud Yuasa and everyone involved, because this film delivers some of the craziest animation I have seen in a film. I think I say at this point I am sold on the director and look forward to whatever he decides to work on next.\n\n *Night Is Short, Walk On Girl* is the perfect film to close out this summer. You never know whom you will encounter or bond with over one crazy night in the city. It is rare I resonate with a film so much, but this is exactly what I needed in my life as a young man and writer. Embrace the night and find your inner youth!\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/26/night-is-short-walk-on-girl/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/26/night-is-short-walk-on-girl/) if you like my thoughts please check out the full review for the attached images, gifs, and score. your thoughts and views means everything &lt;3\n\n ",

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am a Dutch film student based in Amsterdam, currently doing my thesis about the works of Studio Ghibli. In my opinion, Studio Ghibi films feel very different from a lot of other films I’ve seen. It's „film language” (this is a word in Dutch, not sure if it also works in English) is distinct and unique. In my thesis I am researching what this distinct film language is, and why it feels so different. \n\nTo give you an example, by „unique film language” I mean:\n\n1. Studio Ghibli films give a lot of attention to tranquility. I think Miyazaki once referred to this himself as \"Ma\", meaning peace, or calmness. There are many scenes in a Ghibli film that don’t have anything to do with the plot, but are rather a moment of silence within the film, allowing the audience to just look. The train scene in [Spirited Away](https://imgur.com/j8jWuc7) is the most famous example, but I am also talking about small moments, like in [Whisper Of The Heart](https://imgur.com/6KDP4Ky) where the father greets his neighbor in the hallway, or in [Arrietty](https://imgur.com/gjayENi) where she is just sitting down petting a sow bug, or in [My Neighbour Totoro](https://imgur.com/1N0fbhK) where the girls quietly wait for their father to return from work.\nIf you compare this to a Disney or Pixar film, in those films there is not a single moment of silence. Everything is rushed towards the next moment of action or drama.\n\n2. Characters are not bad or good, they’re both. Unlike in Disney films where there’s a clear villain and hero, the films of Studio Ghibli don’t have black or white characters. In Princess Mononoke, Lady Eboshi is destroying the forest and  could be seen as the antagonist, but she is only protecting her people and even helping the ill. In Howl’s Moving Castle, Howl is sort of the hero, but he is very lazy and scared individual, thus not making him a traditional hero.\n\n3. Nothing is ever explained in a Ghibli film, stuff just happens. In Porco Rosso, it is never really explained why our  main character is a pig, and the rest of the world doesn’t really seem to care about this either. In Ponyo, when the  world is going crazy, none of the people seem to question what is going on and overall, there is never really panic amongst the citizens. \n\nI have a couple of more examples, but I think these are the clearest. Now, I did some research on Miyazaki’s working method and discovered that he usually doesn’t work with a script. He draws the storyboard and lets the story develop itself. This might be an explanation to some of these unique aspects of a Studio Ghibli film, but I think it might have more to do with Shinto.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with Shinto, it is the ancient religion of Japan. It mainly revolves around Kami, which are nature spirits, and getting in touch with them (very roughly said). Shinto is not very present nowadays, but is deeply rooted in the way Japanese people think. For example, according to [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Japan), the majority of Japanese population considers themselves followers of Shinto religion (or \"non religious\"; the wikipedia article also explains why this is the same thing).\n\nI won't go into great detail here about Shinto itself, but I've been doing a lot of research on it lately and I can't help but notice the similarities between the religion and the \"film language\" of a Studio Ghibli film. One of the main thoughts in Shinto is that there is no good or evil, this is all in balance (ying and yang). This might have something to do with why the characters in Studio Ghibli films are so nuanced. If you think about the dominating religion in a lot of Western countries (which is Christianity),\nthe moralistic values are based on the Bible: good and bad, God and Satan. This might be why we have villains and heros in our Pixar movies. In Shinto, there is no such thing as good or evil, these things are in balance. \n\nThe influence of Shinto could also have something to do with the „tranquility” or „moments of peace” I talked about earlier. Given that Shinto is all about respecting nature and the world around you, these moments are all about taking the time as an audience to chill and reflect on everything you’ve seen.\n\nI recently came across an article about Shinto that stated that Shinto is in the core a difference between Eastern thinking and Western thinking. The article said that it is very common in Eastern countries to approach life as something that \"just happens to you\"; you can't avoid the earthquake, but you can survive it. To me this sounded very familiar, 'cause this is how I feel about Studio Ghibli films (like I stated earlier): in the film stuff just happens, and the characters just deal with it instead of questioning it. \n\nI hope this „film language” thing I am talking about is not too vague or far stretched. It is generally difficult to explain to people, since I am not talking about Shinto themes in Studio Ghibli work (environmentalism for example), but traces of Shinto in the way the films are made and feel („film language”).\n\n\n\nI could really use some thoughts, opinions or advice. What do you think? Do you think I am overthinking this? Do you maybe have some tips for me how to continue my research? Is there something I am not seeing? Are you from Japan and do not agree with any of the statements I've made? Do you happen to know an interview with Miyazaki in which he talks about Ma, or some of the other topics I've stated? I would be happy with anything. Thank you so much for reading.",

        "text": "I love *Contact*, but I've always found its approach to religion to be curious, certainly for a film written by an atheist (I understand Sagan didn't write the screenplay, but I'm told that the treatment of religion in the film is not different in any significant way to in the book).  Carl Sagan didn't describe himself as an atheist, but instead as an agnostic, however he reduced the concept of a God he couldn't deny the possibility of to a distant, non-interventionist God - a weak Deism - and his son said that Sagan thought of nature itself as being God with no will or agency.  To my mind, this makes him an atheist agnostic - someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God, but who concedes that it is an impossible position to prove.  It's curious to me that the man who wrote *The Demon Haunted World* - a book about how reason overcomes superstition, and how beliefs don't last in the face of logic and rationalism - would have also written a story in which religion is validated in the way it is in *Contact*.\n\nAt the heart of the film are two characters - Dr. Ellie Arroway, an atheist astronomer, and Palmer Joss, a preacher.  They meet several times, and each time they discuss the idea of religion and science being in opposition to each other and Joss refutes some of Arroway's arguments (or, at least, presents arguments that she has no answer to, which isn't necessarily the same thing), but she never refutes any of his.  One example:\n\n&gt; ELLIE: You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more\tthan anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this...means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?\n\n&gt; JOSS: Do you love your parents?\n\n&gt; ELLIE: I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.\n\n&gt; JOSS: Did you love him?\n\n&gt; ELLIE: Yes.  Very much.\n\n&gt; JOSS: Prove it.\n\nTo this, she has no answer.\n\nAnd, in fact, the confession that she *wants* to believe in God is not the only religious influence in her life.  She's shown at the beginning wanting to use a radio to talk to her dead mother (in the original script, she asks if it can talk to God), and it's shown that she loses her faith due to the death of her father, rather than because of any process of reasoning or self-examination she goes through.\n\nWhen she makes contact with aliens, she's given a highly personal visit with her father and denied proof to bring back to others, a deliberate echo of Joss' account of the religious experience he had which made him become a preacher.  She explicitly is shown saying that she's taking the truth of her experience as a matter of faith, and Joss is shown as being supportive by believing her without evidence.  The only concession to it being anything other than a matter of faith that the film makes is that the amount of blank footage proves that the capsule she was in was elsewhere for several hours, although Arroway is unaware of this.\n\nSo the central theme of the film is of an acceptance of faith, and the main character arc shows the non-religious person embracing religious thinking, while the character that represents religious thinking remains unchallenged and is vindicated.  I think it's an interesting story, but it's an odd one for the man who wrote *The Demon Haunted World* to tell, as it's the opposite of what he says in that book.\n\nThe second thing I wanted to say about the film's approach to religion is that I think that one valid reading of the text is that we actually meet God in the film.  I don't mean the alien who takes the form of Arroway's father, but Haddon.\n\nI have 5 reasons for thinking this.\n\n* He is a recurring deus ex machina.  Every time Arroway comes to a dead end or faces too much adversity, Haddon pops up and solves her problems for her with a wave of his hand.\n* One of the central themes of the film is that scientific progress is killing God and, indeed, as the film progresses Haddon slowly dies.\n* Haddon is shown progressively getting further and further from Earth, Arroway first meeting him in person by being brought aboard his plane and being told \"he hardly lands for anyone\".  This, to my mind, is symbolic of God becoming more distant from humankind and interacting with humans less as time goes on.\n* He's shown as an omniscient, omnipotent figure.  He knows everything about Arroway, he has full access to all classified information, he can control things remotely, and any time any solution is needed - no matter how large or impractical - he's shown to have it.\n* Finally, his catchphrase is \"once upon a time, I was a hell of an engineer\", which is definitely something that could be said of someone who created a world in 7 days.\n\nGiven the themes of the film, I don't think these parallels are likely to be unintentional.",

        "text": "I've always admired the early work of Peter Jackson. Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead are all incredibly fun films to watch but today I'll be focusing on Meet The Feebles specifically. I watched it early in the summer and I was absolutely floored. I went in expecting nothing more than a fun, dark, raunchy puppet comedy (although it certainly delivers on that front), but let me assure you it is so much more than that. \n\nThe film is unflinching in its approach to the seedier side of show business. From Heidi The Hippo's downward spiral into depression to Trevor The Rat's lecherous advances on an actress, this is a film that doesn't shy away from shining a spotlight onto real issues that still haunt the entertainment industry to this day. The musical numbers are also superb, \"Garden Of Love\" being my favorite, the music is beautifully performed, and delightfully memorable. There's also quite a large number of characters and all of them are characterized well. There's also a surprisingly wholesome love story amidst all of the sleazy elements. Overall I'd go as far as to say that it's up there with Boogie Nights when it comes to showbiz dramas (albeit more darkly comedic and a bit over the top). \n\nWhat did you personally think of the film? Let's discuss.\n\nEDIT: I apologize in advance if this is too short or isn't in depth enough, I've been lurking for some time but this is my first actual post here.\n\nEDIT: added some more details",

        "text": "I just watched this tonight as I'm working my way through the 1001 Movies You Must See list, and I just don't know what to think of it. On one hand, The interiors, natural settings, sound design, and music are all incredibly charming, and the film is beautifully lit and colored, which gives the whole production a sort of dreamy other-worldliness.  on the other hand, the dialog is about as schmaltzy as it gets, Joan Crawford is about 10 years too old to convincingly be the center of her love triangle; Her makeup, hair, constant costume changes, and bugged out expression are all absolutely comical. Sterling Hayden has all the charisma of a potato, and I have a hard time believing that it's just part of his too cool character. He just seems to sleepwalk from scene to scene. The Dancin Kid (from New York!) has to be one of the dumbest names ever bestowed on a Wild West outlaw. The outlaw's hangout was cleverly hid, but pretty pristine for a bunch of drunkin silver miners in their 20s.\n\nThe entire premise is bare bones simple, it's colorful, and over the top, so I can see why it might have been a bigger hit in Europe at the time than in America. Even if you don't speak the language, it still visually translates well, but I can't help wonder if Ray was intentionally parodying the classic Hollywood Western, or if it only just seems that way.\n\nI've read raving reviews for the film that suggest the subtext has to do with witch-hunt McCarthyism, radical feminism, and/or daring lesbianism, and I wonder how much of that is true, and how much is all just critical post-rationalism. I can't help feel that the truth is that it was simply a vehicle for an aging actress (who bought the novel's rights, who was having an affair with the director, and who handpicked some of the  actors) to remain relevant in her own way. \n\nI don't know if I disliked the film, per se, but I found it frustrating. When great filmmaker/critics like Truffaut and Scorsese call it one of the greatest Westerns, or greatest films of all time, I feel like I'm missing the punchline.",

Even America’s first significant feminist superhero felt the hit. *Wonder Woman* comics took a turn for the worse. They lost their feminist message, became primarily romantic, and didn’t bounce back until decades later. The 50s brought with it an era of extreme sexism that lingered until the 70s, when the women’s liberation movement that emerged in the previous decade started really gaining traction.\n\nThe impact of television, now *the* format, had never in a fictional context been more important. Enter Lynda Carter as Diana Prince in 1975, *Charlie’s Angels* and more. Enter women leading stories in a way that had never happened before. As the world began to change and people started to demand equality—in not just the context of gender but in all areas of life—we were set to begin a new era. Here come the 80s.\n\n \n\nThe 80s are known for a lot of things: pop music, perms, glow sticks (can you tell I wasn’t actually there?). But what a lot of people don’t know is the time was home to the birth of a new type of action star. Cinema was booming with machine guns, aliens, and macho men. It also had other plans.\n\nYou could easily credit Ellen Ripley as the first to initiate the western cinematic concept of an action heroine who presents in a typically masculine way. She might not technically be the first, but it’s her significance that matters here. Her body was toned, she was the informed character in a leadership role, and she was the saviour. Strong both physically and mentally, with a presence a lot of young people hadn’t seen back then. Ripley of course appeared in the original *Alien* film, which came out in 1979.\n\nBut *Aliens* changed her tune. Watching James Cameron’s action/horror for the first time was breath-taking and empowering in a unique way: it was different from the great first film. Even I—who am lucky enough to see a fair amount of women in science-fiction compared to those days—was struck by Ripley making the decision to rescue Newt against all odds. You also had presumably gay marine Vasquez, just as amazing. But the wonder here was in the fact Sigourney Weaver was the star and still allowed to be all these things. Maternal, but lethal. For once in a genre usually dominated by muscles and subliminal sexism, it was a woman in the dirty tank top, sweating and preparing for a fight—rescuing the vulnerable girl in her arms.\n\n Propelled forward by the likes of Weaver’s kick ass protagonist, more of these characters started to appear. *Terminator 2: Judgement Day* starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the world’s biggest action stars and a hyper-masculine god. Huge muscles, easy on the eyes, the very definition of a studio’s dreamboat. It’s the 90s now. All awesome of course, but nothing we’ve not seen before. But eyes widened as we reconnected with Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor. We open on her doing pull ups on her holding cell’s bed frame, covered in sweat and clearly jacked despite the actresses’ small frame. This time she got to hold the big machine guns, she got to dive away from explosions. Sarah Connor represented a new brand of heroism in the same way Ripley did. One I think young women of the time sorely needed. \n\n Another staple of the rise in powerful female characters was *Thelma &amp; Louise*. They might not have been action stars, but boy did they take action. They didn’t have any special powers, they weren’t in a war (not a physical one anyway) and there weren’t any Xenomorphs in sight either. Their battle was a different one entirely. But it was one of English-speaking cinema’s biggest status-quo changers. Ridley Scott’s 90s gem came off the back of a revolution in the way we saw women on-screen. It made use of a different type of strength, but it had the same mentality and fight that made the likes of Sarah Connor so impactful and goosebump-raising for the young girls who let their imaginations run wild. Whether it be in the pages of a comic book nobody reads anymore (seriously, nobody was reading *Wonder Woman*) or on a screen. \n\n Going forward, the call for female heroes only grew—and in the early 90s, after a *Wonder Woman* run of depowered, Steve Trevor-based arcs finally ceased, feminist communities such as [**riot grrrl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_grrrl) used Wonder Woman as an image they could claim for their own cause—the connection between on-screen power and real life change began to grow rapidly.  What once inspired behind closed doors was a new medium of rebellion. \n\n \n\nWe now live in a time of Captain Marvels and live action Diana Princes. And although the topic of representation is far from untouched, for me it was interesting to take a look back. To see where it came from, when it took a hit and when it bounced back in a way nobody could smother. And hey, people are reading *Wonder Woman* again. While it might seem strange to equate how far we have come in gender politics to made up bad-asses from Amazon mythology, it is undeniable the effect they had not just on the people who watched them but on the media landscape we are still working on today.\n\nEmpowerment can be a rallying call for anyone to fight injustice, no matter who you are. Things are far from perfect. The number of LGBT, trans and non-white starring roles in action and fantasy are still [**dismal**](https://variety.com/2017/film/news/hollywood-diversity-little-rise-study-1202510809/). But we subverted expectations once before, we can do it again. There was a time *Wonder Woman* comics were dying out and the ever lessening group of fans were beginning to lose hope of a movie ever surfacing. That was less than a decade ago.\n\n This article was inspired by *Wonder Women: The Untold Story of American Superheroines*. It was also inspired by the Buffy Summers, the Dana Scullys and the Princess Shuris of the world. Remember the hairs on your arm standing up during the No Man’s Land scene in 2017’s *Wonder Woman*? Me too. Now imagine the electricity in the air when Ripley blow torched the Xenomorph queen on opening night. The 80’s was a time of reinvention for the way women were integrated into the action genre, thank god for that. \n\nBy Trudie Graham [https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/25/heroine-history-the-revolutionary-action-stars-of-the-80s/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/25/heroine-history-the-revolutionary-action-stars-of-the-80s/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Visit link for full review, pictures, and videos. Film is available to watch via Filmstruck.\n\n&gt;***What do you know about women?”***\n\n**T**hat was the profound question asked of Martin Scorsese before he was hired to direct *Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore*.  “Nothing,” Scorsese wisely answered.  “But I’m willing to learn.”  Released in 1974, between *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, the film is sometimes overshadowed by Scorsese’s more masculine-centric work.  This is a shame, because *Alice* is a beautiful, hilarious, painful song of an ordinary woman and her glorious awakening.\n\n Born in Monterey, California, Alice grew up idolizing great singers and movie stars.  She was determined to be a singer herself until she met and married an antagonistic truck driver named Donald (Billy Green Bush). “No wife of mine is gonna’ sing in a saloon,” he says. Alice moves to his hometown of Socorro, New Mexico where she divides her time laughing with neighbor friend Bea (Lelia Goldoni) and keeping the peace between Donald and their rebellious son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter). Her marriage lacks the Hollywood passion she learned to expect as a little girl. Donald is dismissive and distant.  Alice is lost, too. It appears they have stepped into a tragic societal trap. “I sure couldn’t live without some kinda’ man around the house and neither could you,” says Bea. Alice tries to disagree but is interrupted by a dreadful phone call. Donald has died in an accident on the job, leaving Alice to raise Tommy alone.  Seeking a fresh start, they sell the house and a majority of their belongings and hit the road home to Monterey.  This time around, Alice plans to walk a different path. \n\n Burstyn, who holds an unclaimed producer credit on this film, enchants as Alice in a wistful performance that earned her Oscar gold for Best Actress. After generating undeniable momentum in *The Last Picture Show*, *The King of Marvin Gardens,* and *The Exorcist*, Burstyn was offered the chance to direct and star in *Alice*.  She refused in favor of Scorsese following a close viewing of *Mean Streets* and an endorsement from Francis Ford Coppola. Her previous roles were often secondary to male-driven narratives, offering limited opportunities to develop complex female characters.  In *Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore*, Scorsese and Burstyn craft the complete point of view of an everyday woman, something rarely explored in that era of Hollywood cinema.  Burstyn’s immense natural ability allows her ample time to disappear into the role.  She is hypnotic as Alice Hyatt, a courageous woman with an unstoppable American dream. \n\n Alice faces new adversity on her odyssey toward Monterey.  When interviewing for a singing job, a sleazy club owner says, “Turn around so I can get a better look at you.”  “Why,” she asks. “I don’t sing with my ass.”  She finds small victories in her survival, but Alice is far from perfect.  The stress of pressing on as a single parent leaves strains of vulnerability for a predator named Ben to patiently exploit.  Played to filthy perfection by Scorsese regular Harvey Keitel, Ben reveals himself as an abusive, womanizing psychopath when Alice finally lets her guard down.  After beating his wife Rita in front her, Ben tackily compares himself to a scorpion and threatens to kill Alice if she ever crosses him.  Tommy watches through a crack in the bathroom door and hurriedly helps his mother cram her suitcase shut when Ben is finally gone.  They escape to the road in their station wagon, hoping for better luck next time. \n\n When Alice and Tommy hit Tucson, the singing gigs fail to transpire, so she strikes a job waitressing in a busy diner.  Genuinely good people begin to sew their way into her life.  Diner owner Mel (Vic Tayback) is a loud father figure who snarls and barks with subdued affection.  He clashes with his senior waitress, the big-mouthed, equally abrasive Flo (Diane Ladd), who sometimes seems exaggerated as she cultivates a friendship with Alice.  She also meets a scruffy divorcee named David (Kris Kristofferson), and the two of them fall in love but not without caution.  This time is different for Alice.  She isn’t willing to compromise her dreams or independence for someone who doesn’t understand.  As she tells Flo in a tender, comical encounter, “It’s my life, it’s not some man’s life I’m helping him out with.” \n\n Brilliant script blesses this film with vibrant, authentic life.  Some of the most realistic dialogue to ever grace the screen emerges through continuing banter with Alice and twelve-year-old Tommy.  He annoys his mother with constant chatter and a ruthless intent to explain a childish punchline.  “Shoot the dog, shoot the dog,” he hollers. Alice doesn’t get the joke.  Neither does David as he and Tommy get better acquainted. Their fondness for one another adds some rich humor and provides a touching parallel to the central romance of the story.  When teaching him to milk a cow, David tells Tommy, “Watch the fingernails.” He replies, “Well Christ, she’s got tits the size of cucumbers. What do you expect?” \n\n The intricate, dedicated performances pulse with creative energy.  These characters behave in ways we know real people to be.  Kristofferson and Lutter are terrific throughout the entirety of the film, but shine best of all during a brief confrontation (David is all country and Tommy is rock and roll).  Keitel is a menace in Ben’s knife-wielding meltdown.  Burstyn is mesmerizing as Alice roaring at Tommy in their motel room.  Low on cash and anxiously unsure if her new clothes will help in finding a job, Alice is finally shoved beyond her limit by Tommy’s restlessness and negativity.  Her voice trembles with a vast range of emotions as she berates him—fear, anger, guilt, sadness, frustration—leaving Alice exhausted like a beast of burden.  She apologizes to Tommy and treks into town, an unwavering pioneer, blistering her feet in search of a break. \n\n In his cinematic portrayal of real life, Scorsese drew inspiration from John Cassavetes, Howard Hawks, and John Ford.  The result dances between harsh reality and mythic romance, boasting expert uses of music by legendary artists like Elton John, Dolly Parton, and Mott the Hoople.  This film captivates from the first frame to the final credits and links gorgeous moments of realistic human interaction with a commanding female perspective.  Best of all, the film introduces us to Alice, a dreamer like you and me, drifting through an unforgiving world, hoping to find her way back home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I had only seen 2 Wong Kar Wai films (Fallen Angels and then Chungking Express), and I guess I was expecting a more vibrant and full of energy piece. Instead, it is a sad, subtle and slow paced drama, although it had many of the traits I liked in the other two movies I'd seen from him.\n\nAfter a few months, I rewatched it, knowing what to expect, and was able to pay more attention to the details and how WKW managed to communicate with his visuals and get the most out of his actors. After another rewatch, it became one of my favorite movies of all time, although I like Chungking Express and Fallen Angels more. 2046 is also great.\n\nIt can also be because I was a bit younger at the time, but I think I already had a good grasp of why I liked a movie. It's not one of those \"I was only getting into movies at that time and I view cinema differently than when I began\" situations.\n\nEyes Wide Shut was one that I kinda liked it in the first watch, but became my favorite Kubrick on rewatches. This also happened to me with Nausicaa, The Skin I Live In, Still Walking and Tokyo.sora.\n\nSo, give me your stories of films that rose up in your favorites list, and why.",

        "text": "My Own Private Idaho is a celebration of River Phoenix. This was an actor, an artist, creating at his peak before going out too young. The best thing you can say about an actor is when they’re doing the work perfectly, you can’t even notice they’re acting. That’s Phoenix’s story, where he emerges with Gus Van Sant as joint auteurs empowering one another to make beautiful, ugly art.\n\nPlaying at the North Bend Film Festival this weekend, My Own Private Idaho is a certain kind of Northwest film. It’s a film about a certain kind of displacement that is functionally a Pacific Northwest attitude. Our story concerns Phoenix as a male prostitute with narcolepsy—who falls asleep at all the wrong times, including on the job. We’re graced with a complimentary performance by Keanu Reeves as a fellow prostitute, caretaker, and friend. The two men search for meaning in the empty nothingness of their lives—prowling the streets of Seattle, Portland, Idaho, and Italy for love and comfort and not finding it. It doesn’t matter where they go; everyplace is their Own Private Idaho.\n\nThis is a film with a non-explicit Shakespearean bent. It’ll flow from documentary filmmaking about the lives of an actual prostitute to a stage play of Henry IV. While it may show the gross juxtaposition of our art and our artist’s habits, it unfolds like many different movies packaged together at once. It was heralded originally as New Wave Queer cinema, and it still sits at the upper-echelon of that category. It contains multitudes of striking scenes. Barns falling from the sky and demolishing with the rise of a sexual climax. An inventive take of our leads talking to each other while existing within the covers of gay porn magazines. A campfire scene that reminds us of the great love and compassion cinema contains, apparently created on-the-fly by Phoenix, if you ever doubt this is his work of staggering genius.\n\nMy Own Private Idaho consolidates the relationship between the actor and his source material. We understand Phoenix within the context of a hypnotic road movie about a lost soul. It is a totem to his own life and that of many who get lost in the upper-left corners of America. It’s a special kind of hallucinatory exploration, where time and place don’t matter, and we’re likely to sleep through the tremendous moments of change in-between.\n\nThis film came at an interesting time for Van Sant, bridging the period between the phenomenal Drugstore Cowboy and Good Will Hunting, those films he made for an audience. With that, we understand the interpersonal importance of My Own Private Idaho. This is a movie that matters to its author. I can’t give anything a greater recommendation than that. This is something like auteur theory running at its greatest capacity. And at the North Bend Film Festival, it continues to shine as a resounding work of the Pacific Northwest, an instructive example of what our cinema could be.\n\nhttps://thefilmera.com/2018/08/23/north-bend-film-festival-my-own-private-idaho/",

        "text": "I just saw this film. To say that I didn't feel extremely uncomfortable and disgusted by the whole thing would be a downright lie. In fact, it is one of those films which, whilst I found it to be not too bad whilst watching, the more I think about it the more I feel like I want to vomit. But I'm not disgusted at the film itself, I think it is important for films to show life as it is, warts and all, and so we may humanise a very real and prevalent evil in society, that of child prostitution.\n\nIt is completely tragic that such a sweet, lively, beautiful child could be manipulated into being abused even though she has no real understanding of the dynamics at play. It perfectly demonstrates why a child 'cannot' consent to a sexual act, because even if she appears to on the surface to be enthusiastic, she has no concept of how she is being mistreated. Children subjected to this kind of environment, where they grow up too early, means they will be damaged for the rest of their lives and will never be able to enjoy sex like an ordinary person. It is also completely hideous to see an half developed body engaged in sexual acts. It is absolutely tragic but real, and I don't believe that ANY real life topic should be off limits, however painful and despicable.\n\nIt is even more disturbing seen in the context of Brooke Shield's actual life story. Sexualisation when she was premature led her to have major problems when it came to sex in her adult life, often suffering from extreme depression. Perhaps her performance is so effective, because she is method acting, the character of Violet is so close, if a more extreme, version of Brooke's own life.\n\nI think this film is a masterpiece. Unpleasant and shocking, yes. But should it be banned for being child pornography? Absolutely not. If you view this film as porn, and get off to it, you are not only completely sick, but you have missed the point of the film entirely, and partaking in the exact kind of culture this film is AGAINST.\n\nHave you seen this film? What are your thoughts?",

But I'm going to be studying at film at college next year and I really want to make sure I am well informed as I possibly can be.\n\nI've seen a lot of films, but my tastes aren't exactly mainstream. I tend to like niche, semi independent films which are mostly serious, and also older films (generally pre-1977). I haven't seen lots big blockbusters I should have, but that is because they don't appeal to me. Titanic doesn't interest me, Avatar doesn't interest me,  Gone with the Wind doesn't interest me. Frozen drove me so insane with its exposure I do not want to see it out of defiance. Part of me thinks I should feel bad about this, that I need to see these to gain a proper understanding of the medium. But another part thinks life's too short to watch things you don't want to, or you feel you ought to just because loads of other people have seen them. I've probably seen loads of obscure films people will generally be unfamiliar with, and you know what, I really enjoy a lot of them. I feel as though I can escape into a different world, a different time period, a different culture, etcetra. I love this as I am extremely fascinated by History and Politics\n\nSome of my favorite films are Citizen Kane, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Rebel Without a Cause, Psycho, Vertigo, Ex Machina, the Grapes of Wrath, Battleship Potemkin, Metropolis, and Blade Runner. I have many that I want to see in the future, but my list is so long that I reckon I'll probably be on my deathbed and still not seen everything I want to.\n\n​My tastes are unorthodox, but part of me thinks so what? Many films that have been considered the best I've seen and thought were utterly rubbish. Still, there is a balance between forcing yourself to watch stuff you don't want and being completely culturally ignorant. I don't want to fall into the latter category. So do you think my attitude is correct? Or should I try to be more mainstream?",

I'd been curious to watch it (for some reason branding, logo and trailer really stuck in my memory) but also reluctant based on my one prior experience of a Terry Gilliam film, *Brazil* (1985). I had seen *Brazil* late on television one night and found it, in no particular order: bizarre, confusing, subversive, and challenging.\n\n*Twelve Monkeys* (to my eye) tones down the bizzarro-ness of *Brazil* but continues with Gilliam's signature wonky camera angles, from-below close-ups and general other-worldness - a visual style which I can now say with confidence I'm not a fan of. The plot, on the other hand, and performances (which I'll come back to) are outstanding.\n\nThe looping story revelations, made possible with a time-travelling mechanism, are sketched out brilliantly, up to the final reveal that Cole (Bruce Willis) has indeed experienced this climatic airport scene before. The film taps into the 'unreliable narrator' trope both implicitly and explicitly (Willis wonders about whether or not he is insane). Willis is fantastic as lead throughout, this coming after *Pulp Fiction (1994)* and before *The Fifth Element* (which itself surely takes inspiration from *12 Monkeys*) and long before his decline to jaded revisits of John McLane-types. Brad Pitt is fun with version of an unhinged eco-anarchist although he maybe over-eggs it a couple of times.\n\nWhat's very interesting is the shift in tone and audience of Gilliam's films as his career has progressed. Both *12 Monkeys* and *Fear and Loathing* are very much adult movies (*Fear and Loathing* was rated 18 in UK and Ireland) but since then Gilliam has moved toward younger  films with *The Brothers Grimm* (2005), *The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus* (2009). This may be a function of studio and/or commercial demands, which is less interesting to consider.\n\nAre there any big fans of Gilliam in this sub? Can he be described as an auteur (genuine question - I don't quite understand the strict definition). I feel Gilliam and *12 Monkeys* in particular have faded from memory in discussion of 20th century cinema - I'm not sure I've ever seen his work mentioned on r/truefilm.   \n\n  \n\nEDIT: I've just learned that a 4-series TV of 12 Monkeys exists, so maybe it hasn't been forgotten about as I suggested.",

        "author": "CineRanter-YTchannel",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/99llo0/film_analysis_video_essayists_what_is_your/",
        "text": "This is a bit of an add-on post from this: \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/992qcc/what_do_you_think_is_missing_from_most_film/\n\nThere was a lot of discussion in the thread about what people think is missing from the vast majority of film video essays. For reference, this was my answer:\n\n&gt; I can't help but feel, with a lot of video essays I see, that they are often always about the same directors and films, and often after I watch them I think to myself \"Yes, but what was the point you were trying to make?\" I often hear things like \"[Director] uses the cinematography here to create this kind of mood\" Yes, that's one of the many uses of cinematography, but tell me how it's done.\n\n&gt; Gotta say, with many video essays I feel there isn't really much being said. I get the sense that a lot of guys are driven by \"I need to make a video on Nolan or Fincher next\" as opposed to actually having something specific to say or want to tell audiences and then making a video on that. Whenever I make a video, it's always because I had something to say about something and wanted to talk about it.\n\nOn the second paragraph, what I meant was that I sometimes feel with a lot of creators that they don't actually have a point to make, that the video they created didn't start with an idea, an epiphany they had about a film that they wanted to share. Or even, watching a film, studying aspects of it, researching relevant pieces and delivering an educational video, which is why I always kinda assumed video essays were made.\n\nIt's probably cynical and some might find it rude, but I've seen a  lot of video essays which make me feel the creator hasn't actually got a point to make (at least not one that isn't common knowlegde anyway or hasn't been said 100s of times before) and is motivated though something else. Either he/she thinks he will sound clever to audiences, when making a video on how \"Fincher uses dark lighting to create a downbeat mood\" or \"Nolan's incredible use of sound\" (which goes onto talk mainly about Hans Zimmer's bombastic scores). Perhaps the creator feels they have to showcase that they know about certain directors, to 'prove themselves' to the internet or something, jumping from director to director like ticking off a checklist. And of course, with the bigger dudes out there whose primary source of income is YouTube, a major motivation is clicks and revenue.\n\nThere must be a lot of video essay makers on this sub. I wanted to ask then, how exactly do you go about making videos? Not the tools (video editor, microphone etc) but where does the idea come from, what drives you to make an essay in the first place? \n\nThe reason I ask is because this is where I feel a major flaw of a lot of them is, in that they have no point to make in the first place. There isn't a particular thing they want to say about a film, or the film evoked a certain emotion response from them but they're unable to explain how it achieved this, they just seem to make videos because...well, I don't really know why, that's why I'm asking. \n\nI make videos on film. Not 'video essays' per se, but ones that talk about different movie-related stuff. The *inception* of these videos has always been, something along the lines of:\n\n1) I watch a movie/wait for an upcoming one, and notice something about it. Something I think is worth discussion. \n\nE.g. watching Sexy Beast, everybody raves about Ben Kingsley's scary and ferocious performance. But few mention that (IMO of course) much of his actions stem from resentment and jealously of Gal and his friends, and the damage from the loss of a woman he loved (Jackie). There are quite a few examples of this, in particular the outburst \"I won't let you be happy, why should I?\", suggesting his visit is not only for the job, but an opportunity to berate Gal as some kind of misguided 'revenge' or something.  \n\n2) Cultivate my thoughts, and do further research. Am I talking out of my arse? Am I stretching? Is there anything that can backup my claims?\n\nE.g. found an interview with Ben Kingsley where he says in his interpretation of the character, Don Logan was abused as a child and never healed, and now goes onto abuse others. He also noted the line \"I won't let you be happy, why should I?\" being the main indicator.  So even though our interpretation is different, we're on a similar train of thought.\n\n3) Has this already been done? This one is so important I feel, as there are so many video essays that regurgitate what others have already said. If there are numerous other examples, then what is your video essay really going to add? If I see that it's been done to death, I usually drop the idea. \n\nPretty much every video I make is done like this. The Irishman is using CGI to digitally de-age actors. I want to talk about this. I follow the above steps. Hmm, Yoda's self exile was quite sudden. Could it have been handled better? I follow the above steps. \n\nAnd pretty much my making of videos really only stems from the fact that they shut down the IMDb film discussion boards, which I loved, and I had no-one to talk to abut movies. So there's that motivation too. \n\nI'm not trying to toot my own horn here nor call out any video esayists, but the point I'm making is that I make videos because I have something to say, which I don't think all video essayists do. \n\nSo I'm asking the question. How is a video essay formed in your head, where does it come from? \n\nOn a semi-related note, I do wonder if film essayists choice of videos would be drastically different if all YouTube videos made no money, and all gained you the same amount of views and subscribers. I.e. these motivations were removed from the equation. \n\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

        "text": "https://youtu.be/7q2KP4NORgY\n*The Obligatory Intro, Skip to paragraph two if your just here for Gary Oldman talk*\n\nI've been in the YouTube game for almost 2 years now. I have done everything from reaction videos to kids potato chip challenges...gotta get those sweet clicks! However after going through supreme undiagnosed depression and trying to rip off every Chris Stuckman and Mike Stoklasa out there. I have settled on two movie video podcasts. The one I'm talking about today is Reel Actors. The episode I'm speaking about is Gary Oldman. \n\nA little history! My sisters and I who are my co-hosts (hostesses?) Have not always been the closest. Disagreements involving spouses, hurt feelings, and physical distances have played a major roll in keeping us from being the closest. Not to mention we were all born a decade apart and all have different fathers. The one thing we had in common? Our crazy Madre. To quote Harry Potter: \"If there is something wrong with the bitch than there is something wrong with the pup(s).\" Things we do have in common? Music. Film. So even though this is a movie review series where we pick one performer and try and talk about as many films that we can each squeeze into our biweekly show. It really is kinda the Trojan Horse to let those all so pesky emotions and feels back into each others lives.\n\nStill here? Ok so Gary Oldman is one of the most underated charecter actors working in film today...BAM! came out swinging huh? It's true though in prep for this episode I rewatched and first viewed about 10 films. Hard to do with 4 children, 1 wife, 1 fulltime job and 1 nightly drinking habit. Before this, when I thought about Oldman I think villain. He plays a bastard better than most. From Zorg to Drexl, from Carnegie and whatever the name of his forgettable role in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He pulls of the mustache twirler.\n\nBut then watching him play Jim Gordon and Sirius Black, and of course his Oscar winning performance in Darkest Hour. There is a kindness and genuinely heart warming subtletie that you don't really think possible from a G. Old performance. \n\nSPOILER ALERT! I was not the biggest fan of Darkest Hour. Do I think he should have won an Oscar in his career? Absolutely. Do I think it should have been for him mumbling and stumbling as the UK's favorite cigar poisoned politican...not entirely. \n\nThe thing with Gary Oldman is his career runs parallels with another one of my favorites Benicio Del Toro. Both aren't always the cinematic focal point of the film. But both are the secret sauce, the pop that makes every project richer. Oldman as Drexl in True Romance is a truly transformative experience. That's saying allot up against Walken, Hopper, &amp; Gandolfini. Oldman truly does disappear in charecters. Need a drugged out crooked cop? (Leon: The Professional) Oldman is your guy. Need an actor that is willing to pull off sexy aristocrat, demon, old man with tit hair and won't complain about sitting in a makeup chair for 8 hours plus? (Bram Stoker's Dracula) Oldman is the actor for the job.\n\nTo round this out I couldn't be happier that I get to spend 1-2 hours with my sisters drinking adult beverages and talking about film. We are all a little mad but can tear up the airwaves with a focused film conversation.\n\n-Thanks",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/99ijph/a_quiet_place_and_hereditary_horror_as_an/",
        "text": "I tried posting this to /r/movies but it didn't get much traction. I figured I'd try it here.\n\nThere's been a trend in horror lately to capitalize on the problems families face. I feel like these movies were more common in the 70s and 80s with movies The Shining, The Exorcist, etc. Now that the torture porn and slasher genres are waning, a lot of new horror movies are becoming more and more like family dramas. I believe movies like The Witch, Insidious, and The Babadook really ushered in this new age of horror.\n\nWhile A Quiet Place and Hereditary are deep movies that explore a lot of themes and ideas, one subtle theme that comes across is how the US healthcare system has failed working and middle class families (moreso the case in A Quiet Place).\n\nA Quiet Place is an allegory for the voices of working families disenfranchised by a healthcare system that threatens their ability to survive. While the literal events of them film are people trying to survive alien attacks, a lot of the imagery evokes a family that cannot afford conventional health care. Stealing pills from the store, no access to functioning hearing aides, makeshift bandages for foot wounds, giving birth in a bath tub (we can probably assume little access to birth control too), death of a young child, and a few others. While very few families will relate to the experience of having their child killed by an alien monster, many can relate to the death of a child for lack of ability to afford adequate healthcare. The fact that the family in the movie are farmers with an overabundance of unsold crop implies that the family works very hard, but the system they live with in exists purely to \"silence\" them. They are even complicit in the system when the father and son encounter the old man grieving his wife. The dad doesn't do anything to try to console the old man. Instead he tells him to stay quiet, essentially internalizing and propagating the disenfranchisement both men are subject to. In the end the father is violently gored and the only way he can rescue his children is to make his voice heard, even if that amounts to suicide. This somewhat reflects the political climate around the healthcare discussion.\n\nHereditary is much more subtle in its messaging around healthcare and the middle class. Regardless of how you interpret that movie, one thing that's hard to deny is that Annie (the mother) inherited some kind of mental illness from parents. The opening shot of the film, which appears to be a first person perspective from Annie looking at the window then turning to work on one of her models, creates some ambiguity as to whether any of the events of the movie are real. One motif preset throughout the film is the sense of isolation and lack of communication around Annie's mental illness. It's not up for discussion among the family and, while we see both parents take medication, we don't see anyone actually speak to a psychologist. The closest Annie gets to actually communicating her grief is a peer support group full of people that cannot begin to relate to her situation. I believe part of the subtext in this film is a cautionary tale about how we perceive and treat the mentally ill in this country. We look at them with thinly veiled disgust and confusion so as to remain politically correct. We medicate them in hopes to make the problem go away, but we don't actually provide them with the treatment they need. In a lot of cases, schizophrenia especially, the medications we give them just make their overall situation worse.\n\nNow I don't believe that these movie are only about the healthcare system. I don't necessarily believe that any of these ideas were intentionally put into the film to create a political message. However, I do think that these new films mix horror with true life family drama and in doing so depict environments and circumstances that real world audiences ultimately relate to.\n\nWhat're your thoughts?",

There are lots of fun B-movies out there that surpass expectations, but today I want to discuss and present my review for [Upgrade (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hTLGlgZ4Z8). \n\nI legit believe that it might be the great B-movie I've ever seen, mostly on the merit that it's better than it deserves to be in every single way. \n\n----\n\n*Upgrade – The Epitome of B-Movie Exquisiteness*\n\n**HYPE:**\n\n\nSometimes you walk out of a movie nodding your head thinking “yah, that was about what I expected”. Sometimes you hang your head in disappointment, having let your imagination steer your hopes into a direction the movie never touches. And sometimes, rarely, you walk out of a movie SO hyped that you can barely contain yourself. \n\n\nThat’s how I felt skipping out of Upgrade. \n\n\n\nI knew I was gonna like this movie due to the awesome and well paced, choregraphed, and viscerally goopy red band trailer. Sci-fi action, grisly violence, and the promise of RPG-esque upgrade qualities brought to film? Ok ok, yah yah, I’m into this.  \nThere’s quite a lot of qualities in this film, even on paper, that I knew that I would be pretty hyped about. I’m very into sci-fi flicks, and especially love the buddy-comedy pairing of a naïve human learning about newfound skills with his AI companion (shoutout BT-7274). I love the action-choreography in the trailer alone. There’s incredible editing, framing, and movement that the camera makes with our character. It’s almost as if the camera is our AI companion, moving autonomously with our character to provide us most immersive brutal action on display. \n\n\nThen we got the incredibly lush, punchy, and 80’s-esque synthwave beats of the music. \nThen we get an actual meal, and not just a taste, of the comedic talents of Logan Marshall-Green. Even in the trailer, he looks at home blending surprise, combat, and confusion into a satisfying display. \nAll in all, even the trailer is a fucking blast. And the movie is EVEN BETTER. \n\n\nI jumped with joy during many of these scenes, and I honestly think this might just be the single best B movie I’ve ever seen. \n\n\n**Break it Down, Baby Boi: **\n\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, I do an audio journal review immediately after watching any theater flick. My voice paints a very enthusiastic picture about this film. I basically liked every single thing about this film. \n\n\n**First, Tears:**  Incredibly, this is LEGIT the first time I cried tears of sorrow and empathy in this film. I don’t think I’ve ever done that… in any movie. EVER. I have for sure let loose tears of happiness, cascading down my cheeks during Wall-E or a handful of other touching moments, but never from sadness. Be it the combined relatability of a paralyzed man (close to my own neck injury and spinal fusion) coming to terms with his new way of life, the parental love received in the scene in question, and the somewhat subtle but impactful acting from Green…. Shit. I did not expect tears of any kind coming from this. That experience alone is wildly impactful for me. This movie had a small romance in it, and while it could have been cookie-cutter, the chemistry between our lead and his wife was surprisingly charming. So much so that it allowed the sorrow to really blossom once shit hits the fan. \nNow, is this the first movie to make me feel empathy exploring disability and struggle? Hell no. But it might be the most surprising, unexpected, and otherwise blindsiding scene of emotional impact I’ve seen in a movie that simply didn’t prepare me for such emotions. Kudos to you, Upgrade. \n\n\n**Secondly Comedy:** The comedy was way funnier, more campy, and even darker than I expected it to be. The movie doesn’t take itself too seriously, but it’s written with an eye for balancing visceral violence with the off-kilter reactions to it. It could have skated by on providing supreme gore and a disjointed story, but instead of wrote in hilarious comedic moments balanced well on camp/genuineness, and then wrote a unexpected, hard-to-predict ending. Comedy-wise, the build-up of him learning his powers is a pure joy to watch, and this becomes a bit amplified in the middle as our hero sleuths his way into a seedy bar for detective work. And then we have LMG impressive robot-mimicry with his movement. Dude must have worked hard on his animation game, because his movements were incredibly foreign and rigid in all the best ways. \n\n\n**Thirdly, Themes:** we’re presented with the very-frequently explored sci-fi trope of “how much do we trust technology”, but it’s made enjoyable through a tight script and a focused story. This story isn’t ambitious. It doesn’t explore cybernetic enhancement too heavily. It focuses on the small-scale impact of a single hero, and we explore his tech-averse personality come to terms with his new, tech enhanced body. \n\n\n**Fourthly, Boisterous Editing and Subtle Slowness:** The editing in this movie is wild. The trailer depicts that alone, and it’s better in the movie in every way. The choreography is exquisite and I hope to see more movies tackle this style of editing action and gore. There’s also a surprising amount of slower moments that build the character tension of our hero, his choices, and his personality. There are moments of world building that I wouldn’t expect, with every single bar patron decked out with futuristic body mods and punky future-cloth. Attention to detail that I’d expect in a blockbuster, but completely surprise and delight here. \n\n\n**Fifth, Style and Concept Adherence:** This movie sets its tone right out of the gate. I’ve never seen a movie that reads aloud the production credits, but instead of a visual cue, we get an Alexa-like AI reading our distribution credits (Blumhouse, etc) aloud. Immediately, the movie is in its own lane just based on this alone. I’ve never seen a single movie attempt this, and it immediately puts us in the shoes our character will be in shortly after. Small attention to detail and stylistic choices like this continue throughout the film, but as far as an impact out of the gate, the movie starts strong. \n\n\n**Sixth, Gotchya Gotchyas:** I can’t really discuss the gotchyas that got me in this movie, but there were 3 legit surprises in the story that had me on my toes. Ready to re-evaluate the film. Unlike the rather unsavory “gotchya” from the recent Tully, the gotchyas in this film actually surprise, though act more as diversions that full on twists. \n\n\n**Seventh, Surprise:** When walking into a movie, there are certain expectations that are set. I knew this would be an action gore-fest based on the trailer. I came here for that, and it delivered. I did not expect a semblance of a romance I actually gave a shit about, I didn’t expect solid comedy, I didn’t expect a gut-wrenching struggle with disability, and I didn’t expect it all to be so well paced and tight-knit that it blossomed beyond the sum of its parts. Yet here we are, and that’s why I am so hyped. \nThis movie is better than it deserves to be in every way. \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\nWalked into a sci-fi action romper with intense action-gore and combat… and walked away very impressed by our leads performance, the emotional impact of a tightly written script, blown away by a wildly fresh blend of action editing and choreography, and appreciative of the holistic craftsmenship completely unexpected for such a low budget B-movie. I almost just wish it had more action combat. \n\n\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n\n**Recommended for fans of this genre?** Yes. If you like action-violence, sci-fi settings, or an exploration around cybernetic enhancements, you should peep this. If you like gore and violence, you should peep this. If you like a picture that comes with a lot more variety packed into its relatively meager runtime, you should peep this. \n\n\n**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** Yes. A cohesive whole, with each part shining bright, makes this a pretty recommendable film to anyone. The lead is charismatic enough to carry the whole thing on his shoulders, the action is punchy and inventive, and the story is intriguing enough that it could plausibly surprise a whole host of folks.  \n\n\nSemi-arbitrary Score: 9.3/10 \n\n\n*As a side note, this movie is the perfect place to discuss semi-arbitrary scores. It’s exceedingly challenging to maintain review scores that hold consistency. What a movie sets out to achieve is often interwoven into how I feel about a film, the budgetary considerations, and even how ambitious the movie is. For a small-scale, low-budget movie with relatively tight ambitions, this movie’s impact was wildly large for me. It hit notes in a variety of categories that larger blockbusters or deeper dramas failed to hit. That makes this movie a phenom, for me. \ne-vaughn\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Today's news of Barbara Harris's passing had me re-watching [Nashville's final scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BYyDusJYJo) again, in which Harris's character is finally given the microphone after the (presumed) assassination of Barbara Jean just moments earlier. \n\nI often rank Nashville as one of my favorite films of all time, mainly because of its grand scale, the complexity of its characters and the way it plays with our assumptions about them. Haven Hamilton, seeming like a self-obsessed, power hungry country star, shows his true colors in the face of the film's final tragedy. Earlier in the film we may have balked at his plan to run for Governor, but in the end we feel as though maybe he has more leadership qualities than the faceless Hal Phillip Walker ever did. Glenn Kelly, a character that post-vietnam war audiences were meant to feel increasingly wary of (especially in the ramp-up to the final scene) remains a kind, devoted fan to Barbara Jean right to the end. It is through this humanist lens that I've always seen the film. Yes, it satires many aspects of American pop culture and celebrity worship, but even with the death of Barbara Jean, it still seemed to me to end on a message of hope and resilience. The way the crowd sings along to \"It Don't Worry Me\" is less of a statement that they're uncaring about the assassination and ready to worship another celebrity, and more a sign that they'll forge ahead in the face of violence and adversity. It's a scene that, to me, shows the making of a star, not through any shallow means, but by someone literally picking up the microphone in the wake of a horrible act and trying to heal the crowd through music. She heroically answers Hamilton's call of \"Won't somebody sing!\" \n\nOthers I've met take almost the exact opposite approach to the ending. It's about our short national attention span. How we're ready to avert our gaze to whatever young starlet is put in front of us, no matter what we may have just witnessed. It's about our unwillingness to face and accept acts of tragedy and violence, preferring to shrug our shoulders and proclaim that \"it don't worry me.\" \n\nI don't think there's any correct answer to whether this ending is a cynical one or not. I personally don't think it falls into Altman's oeuvre to be as cynical about the state of America as some are claiming this ending is, but I also recognize that this movie's release coincided with Watergate, which may have inspired more cynicism than any other moment in American history. There's also something to be said about the ambiguity of the ending's function being a part of the point.\n\nWhat do you all think? \n",

        "text": "So, I will just explain my question quickly. Remember when in 1977, two particular movies came out in one week? One, Sorcerer, directed by William Friedkin, was a dark survival tale about four men in South America. The other was a silly space movie indebted to Western and Asian cinema named Star Wars. We all know the story, Sorcerer was one of the reasons the New Hollywood ended, economic flop, while Star Wars and it's merchandising opened a new era etc etc.\n\nWhat I want to get at, is that Lucas understood (or was rather lucky to point at) the mood of the public in those times. During the late 60s to the early 70s, dramas like The Godfather, Friedkin's own The French Connection and The Exorcist, where solid, auteur driven movies which also made tons of money. Friedkin himself refused to produce Star Wars, deciding to make Sorcerer. Without talking about the mere quality of this two movies, it can be said that Friedkin didn't catch what Lucas did, which is the spirit of the time, the mood of the public who wanted something different, less ambigous and more easily defined.\n\nWhat would be the mood of our current times?\n\nI think that in the last few years, superhero movies responded to part of the public's request (enterteinment filled with special effects, big blockbusters that cause distraction, recognizable intellectual property, nostalgia, and only in the last few years we have seen a bit of diverse cinecomics, although arguably everything this genre could have said has already been done so by Raimi's Spidermans), generating a big fatigue. Arguably, Get Out by Peele is a movie that definitely caught some of it, especially in the US. What else could the public nowadays be  asking for?",
