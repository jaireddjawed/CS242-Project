My Thinkpad T430 (i5, 4 GB) have been handling the load OK but once I started using IDEs it's been slowing down on those tasks (this probably could be fixed by more ram and/or an ssd) so I thought why not get a desktop (the one I have now is a Dell optiplex 745 SFF, core 2 duo, 8GB DDR2) since I was planning to get one in the future for that and emulation. So I was looking for a prebuilt or to build one where I could do both VGA and HDMI (for the two monitors I have) and has an upgrade path overhead where I can add dedicated graphics and more ram later. That being said, was this the best I could have done with what's out there? A Dell Vostro 470 (OS identifies it as Precision T1700), i5-3450, 8GB DDR3 (2 x 4GB, 2 slots left, max 32GB), 1 TB of storage (2 x 500GB drives) for 169 USD.\nThanks everyone and have a good rest of your lives!\n\nTL;DR: Need system under 200 USD and lasts as long as possible doing COMPSCI.",

Is JAS even a thing? Is IJVM and JAS code something found in JVM?. \n\nIf something is not clear, please let me know and I will try to provide more details.\n\nThank you.",

I'm in my first year of university for software engineering, and recently, the parent of someone I tutor wanted to hire me to run a 5-week long program to teach/introduce programming to kids (age around 12-14) in the afternoons as part of this educational summer camp thing that he owns. \n\nThis person has given me free reign of how I want to structure my summer program, and I still have about 2 months to plan it. **I'm afraid of accidentally making the camp too lecture-like** and bore these kids (who are probably only getting exposed to programming for the first time) to death or ruin programming for them...\n\nFor the camp, they'll have access to chromebooks for sure, and are asked to bring their own laptops if possible. So I guess, what I'm really asking is, **how do I teach/introduce programming to middle schoolers in an interesting way?** I'm probably really unqualified to teach, but it'd be nice to get them interested in programming or something. Any advice/plan of action is appreciated!\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr** first year soft-eng student, asked to design/plan/run a 5-week long programming educational summer camp (afternoons only, kids age 12-14), don't really know where to start and probably unqualified to teach. Suggestions really appreciated, thank you!!",

Long story short, I recently had a dramatic goal change and am planning to apply to (computational) neuroscience PhD programs. The PIs from Stanford and Caltech I've reached out to suggested that a strong quantitative background and programming skills are essential to the admission decision. However, the current quantitative background I have is: rusty single and multivariable calculus (took in high school), okay linear algebra (just took it online), very rudimentary familiarity with python and Matlab, and basic statistics from psych. I have a lot to catch up, but I also don't have much time since I'm planning to apply during this coming fall. \n\nI want to become a competitive applicant through learning from online courses, and I would really appreciate some guidance from those of you who are in the fields related to computational neuroscience: 1. what are some essential Math/CS topics, concepts, skills, or courses I should master before applying? So far I know that linear algebra, machine learning, stats &amp; probability, python/R/Matlab are great. \n\nMy current plan is to take Harvard's CS50, UCSD's micromaster in Data Science, Stanford's machine learning, UW's Computational Neuroscience, Princeton's algorithms, MIT's differential equations, and perhaps an AI course on Edx and Coursera in the next year. I hope the courses I'm going to take can cover as many essential topics as possible without significant overlap or non-essential/sidetrack materials. Suggestions to my question #1 will really help me adjusting my plan and building the best curriculum, and if you have any direct recommendations on online courses that would be wonderful too. 2. Is there any other courses you recommend or is there any course in the list that is not a good idea? I'm especially not sure how essential the micromaster in Data Science would be.\n\nThank you so much in advance everyone!",

I want to take courses over the next 2-3 years to prepare myself to apply for a masters degree in computer science.  Given that I will continue working full time as a pharmacist, online classes would be ideal.\n\nBoth [Stanford](http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=1240861) and [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/recommended-coursework) have recommended courses for people interested in applying to their MS in CS programs.

I'm interested to find out if there are additional reputable programs that do the same thing.\n\nIf anyone has experience shifting from a non-compsci undergraduate degree to a masters degree in compsci--it would be awesome to hear from you!

        "text": "This post is inspired by WannaCry, but I've been wondering about this for a bit now.\n\nHow are exploits like WannaCry or Heartbleed, etc, discovered? Alternately, what about things like jailbreak/rooting exploits on phone OSes? Obviously in some cases the code is available, and so someone with enough know-how and time can come up with a way to make it misbehave, but the code is unavailable in plenty of other cases.\n\nFor example, [this Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo) talks about how a buffer overflow exploit would work. However, this is in a very simple program, which the exploiter wrote to demonstrate that exploit, has knowledge of how the code is structured, and the program itself ran as root, all of which significantly simplify the process. If a binary were just handed to someone with the instructions to \"find out if you can exploit this\", I don't think they'd be nearly as successful. I'd imagine this gets massively more complicated for even a moderately complex program with some attempts to prevent this kind of thing, never mind a whole OS.\n\nIs it simply a matter of a million monkeys on a million keyboards eventually making something that breaks the code? Or is there a methodology to finding exploitable weaknesses in code? How do you even know where to start looking, even within a single program which you think is likely to have something you can use? I imagine that there's a lot of crashes that happen before something usable is found, but I also feel like it must be more precise than a random guess.",

I currently have 66 credits but I'm not sure how many will actually transfer (NC vs. SC)\n\nShockingly enough I got accepted into an ABET accredited CS program at Coastal Carolina University for Fall. My question is, how should I spend my summer (aside from saving money at my current job) to best prepare? I've worked through the very basics of Swift in Treehouse but otherwise I have no coding experience.\n\nI've read a few suggestions, FCC, Google's Summer of Code, Treehouse, and CS50, but what would you recommend? I think it would really benefit me to get a small jumpstart and begin falling into the right mindset. I also really want to apply for the school sponsored internships after my first year which requires submitting a competitive resume to the department chair.\n\nThanks everybody-\nAlso, I realize I'm going to have more than enough work once it starts and one option would be to just relax, but I feel like I could really benefit by going ahead and building a strong study regimen and routine before starting.
