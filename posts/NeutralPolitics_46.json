After reading the Politico article it sounds like the deal was more of a political effort to be able to say \"something\" was done without much regard for what it took to get it done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther than these articles I can only find two types of analysis:\n\n*Ranting from right leaning/wing sites\n\n*Silence from all other sites\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[Politico Source](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/24/obama-iran-nuclear-deal-prisoner-release-236966)\n\n[Vox article](http://www.vox.com/world/2017/4/24/15407078/obama-iran-prison-swap)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs this just dirt exposing tactics used to get the deal done or is it indicative of a core weakness in the deal itself?  If this does expose a weakness in the deal, what is it?\n\n\n&gt;*If fully substantiated, the report would underscore that the White House was willing to go to extraordinary lengths in order to keep Iran on board with the nuclear deal — so far, in fact, that it was willing to undermine its own efforts to track and crack down on Iranian weapons programs. It would also mean the White House was willing to mislead the American public in order to do so.*\n\n\n&gt;*But Obama, the senior official and other administration representatives weren’t telling the whole story on Jan. 17, 2016, in their highly choreographed rollout of the prisoner swap and simultaneous implementation of the six-party nuclear deal, according to a POLITICO investigation.*\n\n&gt;*In his Sunday morning address to the American people, Obama portrayed the seven men he freed as “civilians.” The senior official described them as businessmen convicted of or awaiting trial for mere “sanctions-related offenses, violations of the trade embargo.”*\n\n&gt;*In reality, some of them were accused by Obama’s own Justice Department of posing threats to national security. Three allegedly were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics with applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles like the kind Tehran test-fired recently, prompting a still-escalating exchange of threats with the Trump administration. Another was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware. As part of the deal, U.S. officials even dropped their demand for $10 million that a jury said the aerospace engineer illegally received from Tehran.*\n\n&gt;*And in a series of unpublicized court filings, the Justice Department dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of them fugitives. The administration didn’t disclose their names or what they were accused of doing, noting only in an unattributed, 152-word statement about the swap that the U.S. “also removed any Interpol red notices and dismissed any charges against 14 Iranians for whom it was assessed that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.”*\n",

This is because Canada has claimed full sovereignty over the waters of her archipelago, a claim which has gone mostly unchallenged outside of [an incident in 1987](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2865&amp;amp;context=facpubs) where a US Coast Guard icebreaker entered the NW Passage without the permission of the Canadian Government. \n\nThe result of this dispute was the agreement, in 1988, that the American Government would seek Canadian consent before sending icebreakers through the passage in the future. However, a report to congress has [\"raised the spectre\"](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/report-to-congress-raises-spectre-of-american-ships-challenging-canadian-arctic-claims) of future challenges by American ships, seeking to \"preserve the global mobility of U.S. military and civilian vessels and aircraft throughout the Arctic.\"\n\nAt the same time, China has begun developing [plans to utilize the passage for their ships](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/china-reveals-plans-to-ship-cargo-across-canadas-northwest-passage/article29691054/), which would decrease shipping time to the American East Coast, and would give them reason to challenge Canada's Arctic sovereignty, seeing the Northwest Passage formally classified as \"international waters.\"\n\nCanada's claim to the region, according to the Wendover video, is based on the necessity of a Canadian escort through the region, as search-and-rescue capabilities are greatly reduced. And so charging a passage fee could offset the cost to the Canadian Government, which must provide these services.\n\nThere seem to be two arguments, the first which relies on the precedent of the Bosphorus and Danish Straits, both fully contained within a country, but considered international due to their usefulness (especially re: landlocked countries); the second would see the passage treated as like the Suez or Panama Canals, where the Canadian Government oversees all trade that moves through their waters, with the right to allow or deny shipping at their own discretion.\n\n-----\n\n^1. ^video ^transcript",

I would like to consider the results of his policies in a neutral, factual light and I'm hoping you all can help!\n\nThe Washington Times reports that [the economy has added 227,000 jobs](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/3/donald-trump-economy-227000-jobs-added-first-repor/) since Trump took office. How does this stack up against expectations? Do Trump's leadership or policies have anything to do with this?\n\nThe Washington Post reports that [immigration arrests have risen over 32% from last year.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration-arrests-of-noncriminals-double-under-trump/2017/04/16/98a2f1e2-2096-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html?utm_term=.412118fb9c1f) What are the effects of increased immigration arrests, in terms of economic costs as well as social (vacant/abandoned communities, families split up, other undesirable measurements)?\n\nTrump has signed numerous executive orders regarding energy and the environment, [including an order that requires federal agencies to review regulations regarding energy production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/28/presidential-executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-and-economi-1) and eliminate burdensome regulation. Has the energy industry reacted to the results of these orders? What (if any so far) impacts have Trump's policies had on the environment?\n\nWhat other measurable impacts of Trump's presidency are there?\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your contributions to the discussion so far. I've picked up some good info and gotten some additional perspective. Based on the responses so far, it seems that it is nearly impossible to measure Trump's impact since taking office. This indicates to me that discussion regarding Trump's performance (both in favor and against) is mostly speculation and rhetoric thus far.",

The Dems need big money to keep it going — otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought,”](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/856150719656755200) Trump tweeted. \n\nHe later followed: [“The Democrats don’t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.”](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/856171332521820165)\n\n\nIs this a fact based claim? \n\n\nIs metrics like \"% uninsured\" a good metric for analyzing a healthcare system? [Under Obamacare, uninsured percentage fell from approx. 18% to around 11% in quick timing.](http://obamacarefacts.com/sign-ups/obamacare-enrollment-numbers/)\n\nThen, in the [CDC's 2016 report (in pdf form)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201609.pdf)  noted that the percentage  of uninsured children and young adults fell as well. Once again, seemingly overly positive review of the ACA and its ability to get people insured.\n\n If not, what is a good metric for health of a healthcare system?\n\nWhat are some of the current pitfalls of Obamacare and how can these be addressed?\n\nIn the paper titled \"Hospitals Struggle With ACA Challenges\" by Stephen Barlas, he notes that [Interestingly, no one seems too concerned that 90% of marketplace participants are receiving federal subsidies for their premiums and that those premiums average 75%. Maybe those federal costs are less than what taxpayers were paying for the portion of the eight million who were previously costing hospitals money in the form of uncompensated care. However, a report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) inspector general in July said that at the end of 2013, the federal marketplace (13 states have their own marketplaces) had 2.9 million inconsistencies relating to an applicant’s income status and Social Security number.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4159055/)\n\nThough, hospitals weren't doing that well before the ACA. At the time of this article, 2014, the impact of Obamacare had speculative at best. \"This scurrying by hospitals to capitalize on the new ACA programs has had an uneven financial impact on them. A June Modern Healthcare analysis of earnings reports for about 200 hospitals and health systems, both not-for-profit and investor-owned, found that hospital margins narrowed significantly last year despite an improving economy\" (Barlas, S., 2014).",

And has the balance of arguments for and against these conflicts, or the manner of their execution, changed given that the regions involved play a diminishing role in providing the resources needed to keep the lights on in the USA?  \n\nIs there a case to be made that, even were America to become entirely energy self-sufficient, that American interests are still well-served by prosecuting wars in the Middle East and Africa in order to provide an environment of security in which the region's energy resources can be exploited and put to the service of the broader global economy?  And to what extent should \"the principal consumers of these exports—China, the EU, India, Japan, and Korea—[..] assume or even share the burden of assuring their own energy security\"?\n\nOr is energy security actually a fairly minor part of the geopolitical equation for foreign interests in the Middle East?  Freeman mentions other historical policy objectives in the region, which he suggests have been \"effectively abandoned\":\n\n&gt; [E]fforts to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians, to democratize Middle Eastern societies, and to exclude Russian power from a role in the region’s affairs\n\nAre these more important than energy?

This can be seen especially clear within the success of political satire, and comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and John Oliver.\n\n- After leaving The Daily Show, earning massive success on the Colbert Report, and taking over The Late Show, [host Stephen Colbert now averages 3.2 million viewers per night.]( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-stephen-colberts-winning-streak-hits-7-weeks-987663)\n\n- [The January 11th episode on TBS of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, about a week before Trumps inauguration, aired to an audience of 2.11 million viewers.]( http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee-ratings-bump-trump-1201991397/)\n\nThese comedians are almost overwhelming left leaning, I understand that, but I’m very interested in seeing how both left, right, and middle respond to my questions. It also begs the question: [**Why is there no conservative Jon Stewart?**]( https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/why-theres-no-conservative-jon-stewart/385480/)\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Are there any measurable impacts of modern political satire?\n\n2. Is satire hurting or helping the current political discourse considering [how divided we are as a nation?](http://www.gallup.com/poll/197828/record-high-americans-perceive-nation-divided.aspx)\n\n3. What is the right's equivalent of this satire trend and what are it's broader impacts?\n\n4. How do you personally approach the consumption of political satire and what is your advice to others?\n\n##I’ve been thinking about this topic for a while now, but here are a couple articles that really inspired this question and research.
