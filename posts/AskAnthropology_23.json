Obviously it was useful in some way, or it wouldn't have caught on. So how was it useful? \n\nEarly humans had a lot of animal worship. They also had to deal with the dangers of wildlife. So, say a forest tribe has a bear problem. Big ole' mean bear comes and eats people while they're walking in the woods. It's unpredictable, and thus hard to avoid, and hard to combat as tribal groups were smaller back in the day and had less defenses. \n\nSo, what I'm getting at here is, could early human sacrifice have been a way of \"taming the beast\", per se, giving regular offerings to these dangerous animals to control their hunger, and thus their rate of attack, and also their territories? You sacrifice a tribe-member or whatever, now you know that the big ole' mean bear is fed, and thus not as mean, so you can walk around the forest in peace. \n\nOr am I just talking out of my ass here?",

While I'm definitely not asking somebody to do the assignment for me, I figured asking in this subreddit might be the best route to find good debates regarding this topic.\nI'm tempted to pursue the discovery of Homo naledi due to its mix of primitive and relatively modern features and how its dating may lead it to be a direct ancestor of Homo sapiens, or just another extinct line of hominin, as well as discussing how early cultural rituals could have emerged, but I don't think there's any harm in asking for outside advice.\nThe topic given above is just a general theme in which I need to investigate deeper with specific examples and a solid journal article to base my essay on. \nDo you have any ideas of recent issues within the anthropological community about species definition? \n(We also have an alternative theme regarding what \"anatomically modern Homo sapiens\" means and how that concept has been used recently and variably in fossil finds, and what is at stake due to this. If you have ideas that may help with this one instead, I'm all ears!)",

But then, even after modern hygenic practices leave no reason to suspect one hand of being dirtier than the other, the rituals and traditions persist. \n\nDoes this process or occurrence have a name?",

        "text": "I know this is going to be a very long question , I would like the following themes addressed . To give a context of who I am , I am from a sexually conservative society. I am curious about sexuality in liberal societies.\n\n* I would like arguments for or against sexually liberal society (non discouragement for pre-marital sex -teenage sex - swinger culture) vs moderately conservative society( discouragement of pre-marital sex , mated for life , strong belief in marriage institution) which would have best outcome for common good ?\n\n\n\n\n* How does the mating competition favour both genders? does it tip the scale of balance towards one gender ? [A believe the balance has shifted toward females with rise medical advancement like contraceptive because earlier a women had to choose her mate carefully as unlike male once she is pregnant she could not reproduce for an year which means a female has to be choosy where as a male has to reproduce with as much female to increase the chances of passing on his linage , however with the contraceptives this disadvantage for women is removed. since a women's biological directives seek her to find best of the male who probably represent small percentage of male population , which means there would always be a pie of males who would never get laid as likely as females [alpha males having multiple female partners over the course of his lifetime] in  it encourage rise of alpha male societies , with a large bunch of beta-males most likely virgins ending up with non-virgin partners .The above stated ones are merely my own hypothesis I welcome people to dismantle or support it so I can recalibrate my opinions  ]\n\n\n\n* Does the concept of serial monogamy exist ? ( constant divorces and remarriages)\n\n\n\n* does broken marriages result in broken families with bad developmental outcomes for kids ? ( step-dad molesting , child poverty etc.) I had mentioned broken marriages because divorce seem to be more common in western societies. The society I am from believe in marriage for life at-least that's what the society encourages or coherces them to do .\n\n\n* I have also read that a phenomenon called cuckold ( a father forced to raise his non-biological offspring without himself knowing about it ) seems to have higher occurrences in western liberal societies ? Does this phenomenon even exist ? if it exist doesn't it encourage alpha male behaviour ? \n\n\n* What does the act of sex means for people of liberal societies ? is it simple like a kiss , handshake or something complex and emotionally connecting that has to be shown to only people whom they would believe to have relationship for life?\n\n\n\nPS- I know the lot of above question seems like an accusation against sexually liberal societies , But that's not my intend I genuinely like to learn about the merits and demerits of the sexually liberal society . I been raised in a conservative family so I might have some misconception that may reflect in above question , if that's the case please correct me. I am strong believer in individual rights , but I also believe set of rules has to be set in place for society to function without chaos. However when I think about sexuality as both of these philosophy that I hold dear collides it creates a paradox that I cant make sense. So I believe by listening to your answers I can come to the right conclusion about sexually liberal societies myself.",

        "text": "Hello.\n\nSo I’m searching for first of all a general summary of cybernetics use of and involvement in anthropology after the Cold War. \n\n\nThe only book I’ve found that directly deals with both cybernetics and anthropology is “Cannibal Metaphysics”. \n\n\nThe first question I’m seeking to answer is this: anthropologies role in the discovery and development of both 1a. The “extended mind” thesis and 1b. Embodied Cognition.\n\n\nSecond question: it seems from my non-academically trained observations that one of the key differences between “modern” culture and traditional culture is the exclusive viability of myth. \n\n\nWithin this viable myth realm (I know I’m generalizing a bit) is the almost ubiquitous use of a sort of doppelgänger or “avatar” body that is “projected into space” in mythology. \n\n\n2. Anthropomorphization. This “avatar”’or “doppelgänger” is my Second question. \n\n\n\nThe projecting of an avatar seems to be standard fare for most mythologies-anthropomorphization- but Actually the classic Greek myths show this very well.\n\n\nIt seems prior to “sufficiently complex” (phonetic) standardized representation/writing, the dominant form of “cognition” *by necessity*, had no choice but orbit around the “projected body”.\n\n\nSo here I’ve mentioned both a “projected body” and “avatar” and Ive linked them to a form of let’s call it “analogous” cognition that is just as much “sensed” as it is “reasoned”.\n\n\nSo in the first part I’m interested in how early first and second order cybernetics might have further developed the notion of Embodied cognition via anthropology. \n\n\n*i repeat, These are not well researched areas*. \n\n\n\nDavid Prices “Cold War anthropology” is ok but it has the wrong pivot as he is trying to basically say that government involvement and foundation involvements in anthropology are “bad” and I’m not interested in value judgements so much as I am interested in the developments that came from these new sciences coming into contact with each other.\n\n\nThe second question is specifically about the concept of a body “projected into space” as a form of not merely narrative and myth, but that of archetypal exploration itself.\n\n\nThis projected body we can call it the archetypal  “avatar”, is of course an anthropomorphization of natural and cosmic laws (gravity, death, electricity, erotic attraction, war, Oedipal complex and so on) as well as a form of exploring both foreign  environments that the culture is found embedded in *as well as* the exploration of conceptual taxonomies. This is obviously supremely sufficient.\n\n\nPrior to standardized writing, memory was entirely biological and thus getting things to stick in memory was a primary concern.\n\n\nWhile things like “ring composition” (google Plato’s republic and ring composition), memory palaces, clustering, analogy, metonymy, rhyme and recitation of lineage were common biological memory tropes, it seems to me also that an intuitive way of binding memory to the biological would be to anthropomorphize forces, concepts, totems, laws of nature and so on. \n\n\nThis leads me to believe that since anthropomorphization is such a somewhat ubiquitous mechanism in mythology and narrative that it must have some cognitive basis. So in other words we actually, each one of us, carry an inborn “avatar” which is the notion of a body in space and it’s reaction to environment and so on. \n\n\nThis ideal hypothetical body, much like predication is based on platonic ideals or forms, is some kind of evolutionary plateau or discrete compression point where the inherent inborn avatar is achieved species wide as a “totalizing” cognitive convenience and that we use this representational avatar/doppelgänger form to model and explore  orientation towards outside space, potential threats, potential advantageous items/resources in the environment as well as experiments of general haptic/proprioceptive actions prior to undertaking them to minimize harm to the body and maximize strategy. \n\n\nIn other words the “anthropomorphic” avatar of myth isn’t simply some abusive human-privileging “mistake” it is itself a an evolutionary achievement that the more “rational” faculties build upon and without which, rational faculties pf complex modeling via language cannot proceed. So “myth” in a broad sense represents the unseen part of the iceberg of “philosophy” and so on. \n\n\nNow maybe I’m stupid or just haven’t used the right search queries but I can’t find anything on what I’m talking about. Can someone please help me??!!! This isn’t even my main research focus but until I get some decent sources for this, I can’t proceed.\n\nThank you!",

I'm looking for some good solid work on storytelling practices and institutions from anthropologists. Does anyone know of any work that has a strong focus on this area? It's proving a bit difficult to search for, because I assume a lot of the time it's probably referred to as part of a broader ethnography of a cultural group, rather than a specific focus.\n\nI'm mostly interested in the nature of a culture's storytelling practices, the norms and institutions that mediate transmission and delivery of stories, and very interested in how children are encouraged developmentally to engage with and navigate them.  Works that analyse the texts themselves are useful, but a bit easier to find - so I thought I'd try here and see if anyone has any good examples of stuff that looks more explicitly at the practices and cultural institutions related to storytelling.\n\nAny suggestions along those lines? Thanks :)",

I'm sure there's an academic term for this, but I don't know it because I'm just a layman. Forgive me.\n\nSince that might be vague, let me provide a more recent (medieval) example. The Vampyr, Blutsauger, and Nachtzehrer are all regional variations on a theme - a reanimated corpse, usually involved in sacrilege in life or in burial, comes back to feast on the living. Of course, this is limited to a few areas in the German speaking lands, and has a distinctly Christian flavor. I'm looking for tropes that are much older, and more widespread, like the strix/strigae, or the **lem-*, a reconstructed term for nocturnal spirits that would evolve into the Latin *lemures* and (probably-maybe) form the etymological basis for Lamia.\n\nIf knowing my purpose helps: I'm doing this for a personal writing project. I want to construct a setting that feels authentically Indo-European. Doing that demands an understanding of what the common elements of Indo-European mythology are. [This paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00437956.1993.11435902) has helped, but it focused only on the highest level stuff for Indo-European religion (good read, would recommend). I'm looking for the middling ground of spirits and supernatural that actually fill the world.\n\nThank you very much for your time",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI ask this question on AskHistorians, but they removed my post and redirected me here. So, here goes:\n\nOne topic I see feminists and MRAs debate over is the historical treatment of women.\n\nFeminists say that women were treated like property until very recently, that women had no rights, that society saw no difference between women and animals. They cite the Patriarchy as the cornerstone of social structure. I consider this the \"mainstream\" view, which is what I was taught in school, so I won't bother explaining it much, since most people are already aware of it.\n\nMRAs, on the other hand, reject the theory of Patriarchy and instead offer the so-called theory of Gynocentrism. They claim that societies have always revolved around the needs of women. Men would hunt or die in combat to protect the women. They claim that the idea of \"women and children first\" shows that the reproductive ability of women was viewed as superior, not inferior, while men were and still are considered disposable. From what I understand, they cite social evolution for this. As in, tribes that offered women the most privileges would be the most popular for women. More women means more offspring, and less gynocentric tribes died out. As evidence of Gynocentrism today, they cite the incredibly high male suicide rates (which range from double to quadruple that of women), the disproportionate amount of research funding of breast cancer as opposed to prostate cancer, the disproportionate percentage of men at high risk jobs, the disproportionate incarceration rate of men, among other things.\n\nI've recently stumbled upon MRM literature, and some of their arguments seem quite compelling to me, even though many publications consider MRAs as a hate group. At the same time, some of the feminst claims seem a little too surreal. For example, feminists claim that martial rape was the norm until the 20th century, which, if true, is truly a horrible thing, but I genuinely find it hard to believe. I mean, I'm married myself, and I love my wife. I hate to see her sad or crying or in pain. Why would I ever want to harm her? I know domestic violence exists, but the notion that the majority of my ancestors would casually rape their own wives seems horrifying to me. Were they not human beings like me? Didn't they experience love like I do? If I was born 200 years ago, would I be happily raping my wife too?\n\nAlso, I find it hard to believe that men would see their daughters as property, selling them off to the highest bidder. I don't have children, but it seems like an incredibly inhumane thing to do. And I find it hard to believe that functioning societies didn't have laws against this sort of thing. I mean, if women were seen as animals, then it would be considered okay to just kill them or even eat them, like we do with animals. This seems insane to me. Did people really ever live like this?\n\nSo, my general question is, how scientifically correct is each side? What was the social standing of women throughout the ages? I know this is a very general question to ask, so feel free to answer in any way you want.\n\nAlso, let me say that I don't have any political agenda in my questions. I am asking these questions honestly and sincerely. I have called myself a feminist all my life, and it wasn't until recently that I started thinking about this stuff, and I'm genuinely troubled. These are things I've believed without thinking all my life, and now that I'm examining them, they don't seem that believable.",

J. 2016. *Stone Tools in Human Evolution.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press**\n\nAnother go-to textbook. Many lithic textbooks (and lithic technologists) don't do a great job of placing their work within an anthropological context, but this book does just that. A great book for those with experience in biological anthropology or other evolutionary studies.\n\n3.) **Inizan, M.-L., Roche, H., &amp; Tixier, J. 1992. *Technology and Terminology of Knapped Stone.* Meudon: CREP**\n\nThis offers a good introduction to the French *Chaîne Opératoire* approach towards lithic analysis.\n\n4.) **Tostevin, G. B. 2013. *Seeing Lithics: A Middle-Range Theory for Testing for Cultural Transmission in the Pleistocene.* Oxbow Books.**\n\nA more advanced book that proposes a methodology for testing culturally similarity among stone tool assemblages. Excellent manual for those interested in the *Reduction Sequence*/*Attribute Analysis* approach towards describing lithic assemblages.\n\n5.) **Tostevin, G. B. 2011. *Introduction to Special Issue: Reduction Sequence, Chaîne Opératoire, and Other Methods: The Epistemologies of Different Approaches to Lithic Analysis.* *PaleoAnthropology.* 2011:293-296**\n\nThis journal article is widely available online, and does a great job explaining some of the differences (and similarities) between the Chaîne Opératoire approach and the Reduction Sequence approach. \n\nThese sources should provide a good background for anyone interested in lithic analysis. If anyone has specific questions about lithic analysis/particular approaches, please let me know in the comments and I'll do my best to answer!\n\nEdit: GRAMMAR",

        "text": "This is a hypothetical based on my younger self.  There was a lot less interdisciplinary work around then, and I’m guessing there’s a bit more of a pathway now. This would be with only arts and humanities A-levels, but reasonable understanding of certain narrow areas of interest due to scientists in the family and frequent journal reading. The training would be with a view to applying things like climate history, genetics, isotope analysis and epidemiology to history topics first hand rather than always having to rely on others’ papers for the archaeological science side - and also opening the door for a potential shift to, or at least gaining paper qualification in, prehistory.     \n\nWould a student wanting to do that have to do a whole new set of A-levels and first degree, or would there be some kind of conversion programme they could do in perhaps two years? The fees would be terrifying these days either way.    \n",

In a way use it as a hobby or maybe a new degree. But I do not know where to start. \n\nI live in Northern Europe now and I am an expat (or immigrant, whichever works) here. I plan to stay here for the next couple of years, so if I somehow would want to create a new hobby it might have to be something that either can be done from distance or on short term trips.\n\nI have checked several distance learning bachelor programs, but I do not know if it is anyhow beneficial to do a degree again. \n\nIs it possible to volunteer to help people on their field work, even without appropriate background or participate in similar activities? What other options could I have for this idea of mine?\n\nI am in my mid 20s. Working in IT and currently trying to finish my master's.\n\nWould appreciate any directions given and apologies if this is not relevant for this subreddit.\n\nThanks!",
