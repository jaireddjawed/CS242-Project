I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\nHe said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”\n\n\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off, grinning and going “huh? huh? huh?” and snapping his fingers in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him mumble \"facts don't care about your feelings\" as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by asking her about Palestine.",

        "text": "A Bernie-endorsed progressive who won because he actually did the work in connecting with voters and campaigning in every county, while the establishment choices split the vote on the way to facing a Trump-endorsed racist, that shit writes itself. There's a reason so many people are both excited and nervous about this cause having even a liberal like Gillum who knows he's gotta play to the progressive base (a la Gillibrand but with a more liberal background) as governor of the largest swing state is gonna be gigantic come 2020.\n\nThe callback is we have a young, energetic Obama-style Democrat in Andrew Gillum running as a progressive but taking three billionaires' money cause, and he said this himself, he doesn't think he can win without the money. But unlike Obama, Gillum does have a history of activism, where he protected anti-George Zimmerman protesters as a local lawmaker and gave them water, food, and other essentials.\n\nWhy are leftists criticizing him lately? He's made a ton of unnecessary own-goals that sadly only we care about: accidentally supporting regime change in Nicaragua (the fuck?), endorsing Clinton over Sanders, opposing the BDS movement (while nonetheless criticizing Israel for killing civilians on a podcast), not arguing enough in support of Medicare For All after the primary (but still keeping it on his site), and taking too much money from liberal billionaires.\n\nAs a leftist, I'd rather have someone who only takes small donors, because that removes a lot of the shady, sleezy, quid pro quo politics that dominates our country in modern times. It's why I'm not mad at Beto O'Rourke likely being less progressive than he says; he takes small donors so whenever he shows what he actually believes, it's not tainted by money, it's who he is, for good or ill. But I'm less angry at him than other leftists because I see him as a more left wing Obama. I can't overstate, as a Miami native, just how much better his environmental policy, in the age of climate change, is than Ron DeFuckingSantis.\n\nRick Scott cut water management funding by 700 million dollars, banned the words climate change and global warming from being said by government officials, and allowed toxic algae to poison parts of our drinking water. He's worse than Rick Snyder when it comes to water protection, and DeSantis would be just as bad at least. Gillum reversing that and emphasizing a ban on oil/gas drilling plus his gun control policies (hello Sean Shaw, please win as you run for Attorney General) are undeniable benefits to a state, my home state, that has been Republican for the last 20 fucking years.\n\nTLDR: Florida has been so fucked, a Clinton delegate is our best shot at actually changing this state for the better, but leftist movements who rose post-Occupy and post-Bernie are so influential, they're forcing liberals and moderates (a la Gwen Graham and Phil Levine) to not only speak like progressives, but work with progressives to craft policy (like Stacy Abrams in Georgia). This is a net good for us because it's much easier to fight Andrew Gillum and force him to our table than it is to fight DeSantis.",

        "text": "I've tried to write this down many times already, but it's incredibly hard to put into words everything that's been happening.\n\nWhen I made my post ~5 months ago we were talking about \"at least 2 deaths\", that number has now become 322 according to the [IACHR](https://twitter.com/PauloAbrao/status/1033041592704094208), and if we take local human rights groups figures, that number goes up to 450+.\n\nThis was meant to be a sorts of timeline, but cramping five months into a long-ass post would be impractical, so I will try to make the argument that Ortega's government (since the 2000s) has not been socialist, not even \"progressive\" and a bit of a rebuttal to the common accusation that these is a US-sponsored coup for a \"right-wing\" take-over of the country.\n\nIn 2006, Ortega was elected as president with 38% of the vote. Winning the presidency with less that 45% of the vote was previously not possible but Ortega made a [pact](https://nacla.org/article/strange-bedfellows-aleman-ortega-pact) in the late 90s with Arnoldo Aleman of the far-right party PLC (Contra supporters, and neo-somocistas) to be able to circumpass these limits. In 2005, the Sandinistas alongside the PLC voted in favor of the [criminalization of abortion](http://upsidedownworld.org/archives/nicaragua/abortion-outlawed-in-nicaragua-ten-days-before-controversial-elections/) in all cases, this was a move to get the Catholic Church's blessing for their candidacy. Arnoldo Alemán was convicted of several corruption charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison, but his charges were later overturned by the Sandinistas when in government. For this term he also chose Jaime Morales Carazo as his running mate, a former *Contra* leader and Aleman's godfather. Ortega's step-daughter accused him in [1998](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ortega-faces-sex-abuse-case-from-his-stepdaughter-1156496.html) of having continously raped her for years since she was 11 years old. If you would like to read her entire (harrowing) testimony you can find it [here](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/nicaragua/zoilamerica-testimonio.htm).\n\nSince 2007 the FSLN introduced a series of welfare-oriented programs, such as Hambre Cero (Zero Hunger), Usura Cero (Zero Usury) and others with the help of Venezuelan funding. A lot of these programs were done through ALBANISA a private company set up by the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan government. Due to their private nature, there are no public records on exactly how these funds have been spent. No proper studies have been done to quantify their impact on poverty, and those that have been [done](https://i.imgur.com/obvEU6o.jpg) (using simulations) found their effects to amount to practically nothing. \n\nThese and other redistributive measures are usually pointed at when talking about their \"socialist cred\". Another common topic is Nicaragua's sustainable economic growth, and how the US is \"attacking a country with distributive policies while also achieving a high economic growth\", the growth is certainly true, but the redistribution is not, this is a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/Cf8bnp6.jpg) that shows wealth inequality in 2014 is practically the same as it was in 1998. Between 2008 and 2014 inequallity has *actually* [increased](https://i.imgur.com/P6fyHUY.png), in contrast with all the other Pink Tide governments and against the regional tendency. There is no data for 2016.\n\nPoverty reduction is another common topic, but this is a trend that all of Latin America has followed as seen in this [graph](https://i.imgur.com/RbKZnlp.jpg). Ortega has also implemented all the [IMF](https://truthout.org/articles/neoliberalism-creeps-in-nicaragua-s-slow-departure-from-sandinista-ideals/) recommendations on austerity, to the point that the *fucking IMF* have asked him to apply more redistributive policies. [\"The IMF informed the Nicaraguan government its recommendations for the next year: eliminating tax exemptions and taxing enterprises established in free market zones. An international financial institution tasked with signaling the neoliberal route accuses a government -one considered to be socialist!- of lacking boldness when it comes to taxing\"](https://i.imgur.com/bIkKG2I.jpg). The World Bank [congratulated](http://www.cadtm.org/A-Brief-History-of-the-Relations-between-the-World-Bank-the-IMF-the-US#nb2-6) Ortega's government as late as April of this year. Nicaragua's GDP per capita has also stayed the [same](https://i.imgur.com/xKbHcpG.jpg) when you account for inflation and purchasing power.\n\nIn 2013, the Nicaraguan government without parlamentary debate approved a law that gave a 50-year concession to construct an inter-oceanic canal to Wang Jing, a Chinese billionaire, and his company HKND, this in turn gave away a large portion of the country's land, land where peasants, indigenous people, and protected species live. The projected route also went/goes through a major protected natural reserve. A very active peasant movement against its construction formed, one of its leaders, Francisca Ramírez is probably the one person in this entire crisis that has the support of everyone that has risen against the government. \n\nFrom the start, this project was mired with anomalies: there was no bid set up for the project, Wang Jing has never embarked in a project of this scale (not even many large-scale projects), no viability studies where done before deciding on its construction, environmental impact studies mention the destruction of habitats of endangered species and the Nicaraguan Lake, one of the largests bodies of water in Latin America. \n\nA common talking point is that the US is trying to stage a coup against Ortega's government because of the canal's construction \"they don't want to lose their control on trans-atlantic trade\" but no real actions have been taken to start construction on the Canal. 2015 was a [\"decisive year\"](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:37212-2015-un-ano-decisivo-para-el-gran-canal-interoceanico-de-nicaragua), 2016, [\"everything ready for the Canal's construction\"](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:46148-gran-canal-interoceanico-de-nicaragua-casi-todo-listo-para-iniciar-construccion-de-puerto-en-brito), late 2016 [\"the canal moves forward\"](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:50434-canal-interoceanico-avanza-en-nicaragua), but no actual construction work has ever happened. By 2016, Wang Jing had lost about 50 percent of his [fortune](https://www.forbes.com/profile/wang-jing/#d51f7b358ae6), by April of this year his company, HKND, [closed its headquarters in China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/nicaragua-canal-builder-abandons-office-in-prime-hong-kong-tower), and didn't leave information on their new address.\n\nSomething that must be remarked is that repression as a response to social mobilization is not something new, the proportion of these months repression is of course new, but any form of protest was always met with a horde of police forces. [Women's](https://rotativo.com.mx/mujer/668838-policia-bloquea-marcha-de-mujeres-en-nicaragua/) [marches](https://www.dw.com/es/nicaragua-polic%C3%ADa-interrumpe-marcha-en-honor-a-berta-c%C3%A1ceres/a-19103004), [peasant](https://www.efe.com/efe/america/sociedad/campesinos-de-nicaragua-denuncian-presion-policial-por-marcha-contra-el-canal/20000013-3111600) [demonstrations](http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/02/the-peasant-farmer-who-has-stood-up-to-the-president-of-nicaragua/), even solidarity [protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/24/nicaragua-protests-interoceanic-canal-rivas) against their possible evictions. [Protests by workers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/-sp-nicaragua-kidney-disease-killing-sugar-cane-workers) affected with [chronic kidney failure](https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/qkxv7v/the-silent-epidemic-behind-nicaraguas-rum) by their time working in Pellas's (the richest man in Nicaragua) [sugar refinery](https://images.vice.com/munchies/wp_upload/Protest-Julio-Lopez-2.jpg?resize=1050:*) were not the exception. \n\nOther protests include an entire town fighting against a minery that was given an extraction concession. Even [this](https://www.shareprophets.com/views/29832/condor-gold-nicaragua-court-no-show-as-it-bullies-peasants-opposing-la-india-mine) \"capitalist through and through\" calls their actions wrong, but the government responded by [sending riot police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nh1NakMyVg). This isn't just a one-town thing, [here's](http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/4678) another story, about B2Gold a canadian mining company and Santo Domingo.\n\nWhat gave rise to the protests was a series of austerity measures to the social security system which made employees, retirees and employers contribute 5% more to the system (done as a way to recover the social security system from mismanagement, its funds used to finance a luxury housing complex). [Retirees](https://twitter.com/ProtestaNica/status/986645700673966080) went out to protest and they were met with physical [aggressions](https://twitter.com/eliz_romero/status/986788207793668096) from Sandinista youth members. This caused widespread protests in different college campuses that led to months-long occupations of some of them. While these campuses remained occupied, the police force and paramilitary pro-government gangs attacked them constantly using live ammunition, those occupying them defended themselves using artisanal non-lethal weapons. People were hurt and killed by these attacks, and improvised medical centers were set up at/or near the occupied universities because Red Cross ambulances were denied access and a lot of public hospitals denied treatment to those hurt in the protests. (This was the case of a [15 year-old kid](https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2018/07/27/nicaragua-good-guys-turned-bad) who was shot while handing out water to student protesters), The measures were later overturned, but there were already dozens of dead people, so the protest cry was about justice, and as the number of deaths increased due to the violent crackdown, it became about Ortega leaving power.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous post, Ortega has followed a \"consensus model\" as a form of government, where they held private meetings with COSEP (Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada, _the capitalists_) to decide on economic policies. All those IMF-approved policies I mentioned before have been decided this way. When a dialogue process was set-up in mid-May everyone thought COSEP representatives would be just another poster child for the government and they weren't (and still aren't) trusted. Organized social movements have called for them to support national strikes (they have only supported three 1-day strikes) and to call for generalized tax evasion so the government runs out of money to fund the police and their paramilitary gangs but they haven't done so.  \n\nThe protests became a general uprising against the government's deadly repression, and this uprising was met with.. deadly repression. At one point, road-blocks and [barricades](https://nacla.org/news/2018/07/09/nicaragua-barricades) were set up [all over the country](https://twitter.com/MonicaLopezBalt/status/1004379214710214662). The dialog process reached a deadlock after the government refused to order a cease of the repression, they went on and on about the roadblocks. Through the dialog, a comission was created to gradually remove the roadblocks by verifying the security conditions at the different sites they were set up, but Ortega chose to \"clean\" them with coordinated attacks by the police and paramilitary using military grade firearms, while protestors use [artisanal weapons](https://twitter.com/M_Autoconvocado/status/1019348139864621056). This is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_Boo5KgTU) (by RT) that shows how that looked like in Jinotepe, a small city. This was the situation of towns and cities all over the country. Jinotepe was later attacked in what became the deadliest day so far, [\"thirty-one anti-government and three pro-government protesters were among those killed. Four police officers also died in the clashes.\"](https://thinkprogress.org/nicaragua-death-toll-protests-4ebd79eb64e1/). [Masaya](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-masaya), a (previously) Sandinista stronghold, was one of the most belligerent cities with barricades set-up all over the city, and at some point declaring themselves in [self-government](http://www.news4europe.eu/6350_world/5461035_cradle-of-nicaragua-s-sandinista-revolution-prepares-for-self-government.html). Days after they did this, they were viciously [attacked](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/nicaragua-pro-ortega-forces-opposition-stronghold-monimbo-180718054338186.html) by pro-government forces. [This](https://elfaro.net/es/201806/centroamerica/21979/Masaya-se-atrinchera-contra-Ortega.htm) is a great article on [Masaya](https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1536106478512-009.jpeg), it's written in Spanish but Google does a great job at translating it. \n\nFor Mother's day a national march was called by \"Madres de Abril\" an organization that consists of mothers who have had their children killed. This was one of the [largest](https://twitter.com/elnuevodiario/status/1001953609649664000) demonstrations so far, as it was coming to an end it [was](https://twitter.com/JorgeaHurtado/status/1002003643221073922) [attacked](https://twitter.com/patriaescapista/status/1005684749090934784) by the [police](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DefqD2oX0AA5dQW.jpg) and [paramilitary forces](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DefqLb7XkAAFJ46.jpg), at least [15 people](https://www.dw.com/en/nicaragua-death-toll-rises-after-mothers-day-protests/a-44028455) ended up dead that day. A few days earlier there was an attempt by students to occupy UNI (Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería) which was met with another [violent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KdEOvelaY&amp;feature=youtu.be) [crackdown](https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/465752-violencia-nicaragua-protestas-univesitarios/) and several people injured/arrested.\n\nThe largest public university, UNAN, was [occupied](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/nicaragua-university-protest-daniel-ortega-occupation) by students for about two months, they were sporadically attacked, generally late at night and sometimes for hours, by the police or pro-government paramilitary forces. On the 13th of July, they were attacked for more than 16 hours non-stop, the police broke into the university and students took refuge in a nearby [church](https://twitter.com/LudwingMoncadaB/status/1017926257928036352), this didn't stop the attack, [this](https://twitter.com/LudwingMoncadaB/status/1018131435511795715) is how the church [looked](https://i.imgur.com/hyWjkB3.png) like the next morning. Two people were killed, and several more were injured. \n\nAs is evident, university students have had a key role in the protests, as the crisis went on, student movements emerged. Five of them were part of the (now virtually dead) National Dialogue: Movimiento Estudiantil 19 de Abril (ME19A), Movimiento Universitario 19 de Abril (MU19A), Alianza Universitaria Nicaragüense (AUN), Coordinadora Universitaria por la Democracia y la Justicia (CUDJ) and the UNA's (Universidad Nacional Agraria) movement. The student movement is a really long topic and it would easily make for its own post but I will try to get at the key things here. Most of them have a crisis of legitimacy because they were formed as the situation developed and there was no time (or the safety conditions) to held assemblies or formal elections. Some of them are also just the capitalists student wing, these are generally loathed because the COSEP is largely seen as the cause the government has stayed on power for so long. Members of MU19A and AUN held a meeting with Marco Rubio and Ileana Ros, this was met with a mixed reaction. They were some of the very first international figures to condemn what was happening, but an American intervention is (obviously) seen as a bad thing. The AUN member that met with them was booted from the movement because of this specific meeting, and MU19A is seen as the worst student movement because they asked for financial contributions they haven't accounted for. Most of their public figures are exiled in Costa Rica so they have no real grassroots to speak of. \n\nI find the CUDJ to be the best \"movement\", they have tried their best to hold public student assemblies, and have an actual connection to social movements and the different efforts made inside universities. Their international efforts have also been exclusively directed to progressive or leftist politicians/movements. 20 of their members were [captured](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1033433158140743681) by the police, and later [released](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1033513246895099905). In later detentions, 9 of them have been [captured](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1039334721409429504), they all remain in prison, some have even been charged with murder. One of them, [Victoria](http://www.managuafuriosa.com/victoria-activista-transgenero-priosionera-politica/), is a trans woman and LGBTQ+ activist, she was kept in the men's cells, and was [not](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1038064115162513408) transferred to the women's prison system. The CUDJ has also persistently highlighted the contradictions between the COSEP's rethoric and their lack of action.\n\nThere's always talk of the opposition, but conventional political parties are almost universally rejected, they're seem as corrupt and fraudulent. When a National Dialogue was called for by the government to be mediated by the Episcopal Conference, no \"opposition\" politicians where part of it, instead, figures with national recognition, diverse personal backgrounds and ample participation in social struggles (these being represented by them) where included. The presidents of the major private sector groups were also included, an economic crisis was already looming, and they were the goverment's second arm for eleven years, so any \"National\" dialogue without their participation would have been moot. Union representatives and government officials where the remaining participants of the dialogue.\n\nBefore the dialogue began, an opposition alliance of some of its participants was formed \"The Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy\" make up of: \n\n\nOne member of each of the 5 student movements I mentioned previously\n\nAzahalea Solís, a feminist activist and part of the MAM (Autonomous Movement of Women) \n\nSandra Ramos, a feminist activist and union leader, part of the MMEC (Movement of Working and Unemployed Women \"María Elena Cuadra\"), she was \nalso a member of AMLNAE (the Sandinista Women's association) in the 80s.\n\nCarlos Tünnerman, lawyer, writer, Minister of Education in the 80s when the Literacy Campaign was launched, he was also a Sandinista congressman in the late eighties.\n\nJosé Idiaquez, University rector, of UCA (Central American University)\n\nErnesto Medina, University rector, UAM (American University), political secretary of the FSLN in Leon in the 80s and vice-rector of UNAN-Leon during that time.\n\nMaría Luisa Acosta, Lawyer and Coordinator of the CALPI (Legal Assistance Center for the Indigenous Peoples), very active in the fight against the Construction of the Interoceanic Canal.\n\nDaisy George West, Sociologist, masters in Social Anthropology, human rights defender of indigenous peoples and afrodescendants.\n\nMedardo Mairena and Pedro Mena, members of the Peasant Movement, they're both currently [jailed](https://twitter.com/elnuevodiario/status/1042511988272902145).\n\nPrivate Sector:\nJosé Adan Aguerri (COSEP, Supreme Council of Private Enterprise)\n\n\nMaría Nelly Rivas (AmCham, an (((NGO))), American Chamber of Commerce)\n\nJuan Sebastián Chamorro (Funides, a neoliberal thinktank)\n\nMichael Healy (Upanic, a group of large to medium sized agribusiness companies)\n\nÁlvaro Vargas (Faganic, a group of large to medium sized livestock farming companies)\n\n**Other important figures/movements (that were not part of the dialogue) include:**\n\nFrancisca Ramírez, [peasant movement](http://endimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ckeditor/2018/05/15/carabanas-de-campesinos-49.JPG leader, [barred from being part of the dialogue](https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/464229-francisca-ramirez-exluida-dialogo-nicaragua/)\n\nFélix Maradiaga, president of the IEEPP (a think-tank that \"promotes\" \"economic social responsibility\"), he's being groomed by the US to be a presidential candidate (more on that later)\n\nVilma Núñez, president of CENIDH, the largest human rights organization in the country, she was a student organizer against Somoza in the 60s, defense lawyer of political prisoners during Somoza's dictactorship and Vice-president of the Justice Supreme Court during the Sandinista Revolution.

Pro-governments unions have always been in line with the FSLN's current antics, ProSalario was a medical union fighting for better wages during Alemán's and Bolaños' government, FETSALUD the FSLN's medical union didn't support their strikes because the FSLN had a arrangement with the current government and basically served as scabs, only until the later stages (when it became a national crisis), did FETSALUD join in. ProSalario was later [gutted](https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/15871-prosalarios-denuncian-que-quieren-barrerlos/) when the FSLN took power.\n\n***\n\nMy Twitter timeline for the last 5 months has been filled with cities and universities being attacked, videos/images of dead or hurt people, and increasingly images of jailed/missing people, these have been some of the worst months of my life. As a Nicaraguan, you grow up listening to stories about Somoza: the missing people, the deaths, the National Guard. You grow up with the certainty that you will never experience that, but now that's exactly what's happening. You can hear the older people say \"It's Somoza once again, it might even be _worse_ we were armed back then, now its just a massacre.\"\n\n***\n\nAnother thing I want to make clear is that this is not an anti-Sandinista movement, as it can be seen there's plenty of dissident Sandinista figures that are part of the \"opposition\", as well as being of those being [jailed](https://www.dw.com/es/detenciones-entre-figuras-hist%C3%B3ricas-del-sandinismo-en-nicaragua/a-45263263).

As I've shown there's so many internal contradictions to explain why this is a legitimate struggle against an autocratic government that has worked for its own enrichment and those of its friends and the old bourgeoisie. Ortega's government is rooted in neoliberalism, extractivism, [social conservativism](https://i.imgur.com/07KWvAo.png) and alliances with the most reactionary segments of the country. This is not to say the US government has not tried to exploit the current crisis, as I mentioned, they've been grooming Felix Maradiaga to be a presidential candidate. He's been given a suspicious amount of opportunities to denounce what's been happening, at the UN, the OAS, to US gov. officials, international media and others. He's not an actual policitian, but he would be a bit of a novelty in Nicaraguan politics, being socially liberal, and (probably) fiscally conservative. (he deadnamed Victoria, the trans activist I mentioned before, but later apologized) He also has a terribly pro-US rethoric. All in all he would be a pretty shitty candidate. He got more attention (when he didn't have as much of an audience nationally) after he was accused of terrorism and funding of weapons of mass destruction (lol).  He doesn't have as strong of a connection to the grassroots movements organizing against Ortega so I don't think they will succeed on imposing him.\n\nThe US Congress has been debating a law sponsored by Ileana Ros and Marco Rubio which is a series of economic sanctions against the entire country and individual sanctions to those who have been responsible for the repression/killings/corruption. The economic sanctions to the country will do nothing but exacerbate the financial crisis we're soon to get into, they will help no-one. The US should focus its efforts on humanitarian funding for those who have ran away to Costa Rica since the crisis began. \n\nI finish my post by quoting from Cortázar's 1983 _Nicaragua, So Violently Sweet_ \"The situation in Nicaragua is dire. Understanding it is already something, trying to lend a hand would be even better.\" On last weekend's march a [16 year old teen](https://twitter.com/elnuevodiario/status/1044216194868432897) was killed by the police/paramilitary forces. Here's a [video](https://twitter.com/vandalica88/status/1043934062375817216) of the police shooting at the march. \"Don't shoot at the People, aren't you the People too?\" Cop: \"I don't give a fuck\". This is a [list](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1044059288140959744) of kidnappings by the police that happened on that same weekend. Yesterday, the jailed student activists from the Coordinadora were [presented](https://twitter.com/CudjNicaragua/status/1044637670176116737) for their first day of trial.\n\nThanks for reading if you've gotten this far, sorry for actually making a long-ass post. \n\nFurther recommended reading:\n\n[Nicaragua: A View from the Left | NACLA](https://nacla.org/news/2018/07/25/nicaragua-view-left)\n\n[Deciphering the Nicaraguan Student Uprising | NACLA](https://nacla.org/news/2018/07/03/deciphering-nicaraguan-student-uprising-descifrando-el-levantamiento-estudiantil)\n\n[Nicaragua at the Barricades | NACLA](https://nacla.org/news/2018/07/09/nicaragua-barricades)\n\n[The Battle For Nicaragua's Streets | Socialist Worker](https://socialistworker.org/2018/06/21/the-battle-for-nicaraguas-streets)\n\n[The Rise of a New Resistance in Nicaragua | Socialist Worker](https://socialistworker.org/2018/05/03/the-rise-of-a-new-resistance-in-nicaragua)\n\n[A Massacre, Not a Coup: A Response to Misinformation on Nicaragua | Mary Ellsberg](https://pulsemedia.org/2018/08/03/a-massacre-not-a-coup-a-response-to-misinformation-on-nicaragua/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) (Daughter of Daniel Ellsberg)\n\n[Capitalist Development in Nicaragua and the Mirage of the Left | Verso Books](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3835-capitalist-development-in-nicaragua-and-the-mirage-of-the-left)\n\n[Behind the barricades of Nicaragua's anti-government protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/barricades-nicaragua-anti-government-protests-180628075225822.html) (Photo-Journalism)\n\n[Nicaragua: Memories of a bygone revolution](https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2018/08/nicaragua-memories-bygone-revolution-180801191705953.html)\n\n[What mutations have turned the FSLN into what it is today? | Mónica Baltodano](http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/4804)\n\n[“I’m certain we’ll bring down this dictatorship” | Julio López](http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/5512)\n\n[From socialist liberators to ‘institutional dictators’ | New Internationalist](https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2018/07/27/nicaragua-good-guys-turned-bad)\n\n[Open veins of Nicaragua | Boaventura de Sousa Santos](http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/5514)\n\n[Nicaragua: The evolution of the regime of President Daniel Ortega since 2007](http://www.cadtm.org/Nicaragua-The-evolution-of-the-regime-of-President-Daniel-Ortega-since-2007)\n\n[Imperialism wants to impose an Orteguismo without Ortega | Alejandro Bendaña](https://medium.com/la-tiza/el-imperialismo-quiere-imponer-un-orteguismo-sin-ortega-6fe900d865bb) (Spanish)\n\n**[What Went Wrong?
