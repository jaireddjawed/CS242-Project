How did satellites send data that said, \"yeah so it turned either this way or this way,\" to give 2 specific routes? Unless the map was more of a theory thing, but as far as I saw and from how the guy in the show presented it, it seemed more like they were saying the satellite data showed one of those 2 routes were the definite route.

Sure, the corporate world loses an hour and employees gain the benefit (for once) and people are less likely to get into sleep deprived accidents. This is especially worse on a Sunday into Monday situation.\n\nThoughts? I suggest we spring ahead, lose the hour after 12 noon, and in the fall we keep the overnight extra hour of sleep.",
