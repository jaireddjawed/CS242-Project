        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11p2s35/examples_of_films_that_are_either_surprisingly/",
        "text": "An example of an underrated film that is more nuanced than I expected is The Ringer (2005). The initial plot is about a regular guy (played by Johnny Knoxville) who pretends to be disabled to enter the special olympics. With that kind of plot synopsis, one would easily expect a cookie-cutter comedy about a regular guy with prejudiced beliefs realizing he misjudged this group of people, and then having a whole liar revealed and big arc at the end of being a better person. But the movie actually takes a different direction, with the disabled/neurodivergent athletes figuring out his scheme early but still working with him, which leads to some great comedy that doesn't end up coming off as offensive (and this came out in 2005). As such, the film takes a different turn and really subverts expectations. If I had criticism it honestly could've been even more nuanced and touched on some really interesting topics. The goal of the disabled athletes is to take down this one athlete who's become arrogant ever since he became a star and was sponsored by corporations. The film just sorta paints this guy as a cocky asshole but if it touched on the corporations part more, it could've honestly made him a more nuanced villain and even touched on issues of how corporations use diverse groups of people to their own benefit. And do keep in mind this is for a Farrelly-brothers produced comedy from 2005 with a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is just insane to me.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also films that are just bad but more infuriating once you realize how interesting they could've been with different people behind the camera. One such film is Adam Sandler's That's My Boy, which I honestly consider to be one of his absolute worst films. The plot revolves around Sandler being a teenage dad after having sex with his teacher and then visiting his son years later once he's about to be married. Hot take; the plot itself isn't super problematic but moreso in the way the film paints Sandler's relationship with his teacher as a positive thing, with him becoming a celebrity over it in his youth but losing popularity as he grows up. But honestly, I actually wouldn't mind it if the film framed it differently. What if, yeah he was a celebrity for fucking his teacher? But the reason he loses popularity is that times change and people start to realize how fucked up that is, and through the journey with his son, Sandler's character ends up going on an arc realizing that he was in a troubled relationship where he was abused and learns to accept that. You'd be taking a dumb Adam Sandler comedy and making it a more nuanced film touching on themes of abuse and power dynamics. But no, instead we get this whole film trying to frame Sandler's relationship as a positive thing, as well as unfunny, painful jokes of Andy Samberg being treated like shit or a weird incest plotline. I honestly think this is worse than something like Jack and Jill, since at least that was unfunny but this is just ugly and incredibly disgusting. It's the definition of Sandler having no filter and just taking the dirtiest shit and assuming it's gonna be funny (which is ironic since this is one of his rare R rated comedies).",

After reading last months appreciation thread, I finally sat down and watched it. \n\nThe movie was an incredible snapshot of Tarantino’s youth, of 90s culture, of so many seminal performances. \n\nBut goddamn. The music was horrible. Hans Zimmer’s weird ass xylophone theme was such a terrible mismatch for the tone of this film. It was whimsical, not young and brash. It was cute, not cool.\n\nI then watched Tarantino’s commentary track and he said that his script had specific song choices. Tony Scott, as was his right as director, supposedly only took a single of Quintins suggestions.\n\nI would absolutely love to see this film with Tarantino’s song choices. He is such a master of tone and picking perfect needle drops. Anybody with me?",

The kills were great, the shrine was cool, and the opening scene...awesome! The cast wasn't anything to brag about, except for Courteney Cox. One actress in particular that annoys the shit out of me is Jenna Ortega! Like, can we seriously stop putting her in every fucking movie?! She's overrated as hell and isn't all that good of an actress. The one who plays her older sister annoyed me also, and the strange unnecessary love interests that took up majority of the film. The killers' motives were stupid and had me shaking my head in the theater. Hell, Courteney Cox barely had any screen time it seemed like, maybe 20 mins at the most?! That's why Scream 6 is the lowest on my list, but I guess other people say otherwise.",

This is a charity to minorities. The minorities don't need charity but an equal opportunity for education, development and fair competition.\n\nI bring this up because a Japanese game about the European Middle Ages was recently criticized by western for having no black characters.\n\nIn case misunderstand, let me explain that the East Asian like white skin since thousands of years ago, before we knew there were Caucasian and Negros in this world. And I admit that there has been some racial discrimination in East Asian since 1840, when Europeans began to colonize East Asia.",

Personally, I want a great mystery to solve (The Others), killer production design (Crimson Peak, Beetlejuice), and/or excellent tension building. And I’m also partial to sillier productions like Casper (which actually, let’s be real, also has some incredible production design). I even watched High Spirits recently and it’s a pretty fun haunted house ride. \n\nWith We Have a Ghost and Haunted Mansion coming out it feels like ghosts are moving back into the storytelling zeitgeist, especially in comedic form.",

And the cinematography while better than the first just doesn't suit it as well, I adored the musky beat down cinematography of the first I found it fitting for the movie, as rama slowly traverses his way to the top floor it never let me go, the combat was also just as good maybe a little worse than raid 2 was so exhilarating, there's barely any flaws within this movie rather than the lack of character development but that didn't really matter to me as the raid has always been a stone cold martial arts movie to me and its just so much better than 2, 2 was underwhelming for me, I know it's unpopular, 2 is generally regarded to the same standard as raid 1, but personally I don't see it",

However, even though the film is quite easily understandable on the whole, there is one weird thing that puzzles me. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\nAt the end of the film, Joe (Death) gives the coffee shop guy’s life back so that Susan could live a life with a person she could love, because Death cannot stay by her side himself. The coffee shop guy’s name is not revealed to us at any point, if I remember correctly (please correct me if I’m wrong). So what would happen, if Susan called the guy Joe? Like it is quite unlikely that the guy’s actual name would concidentally be Joe.\n\nCould it be that Susan knew that Joe was Death, and the resurrected coffee shop guy is a different person. Did Susan accept that Joe is now gone, but now she can find love with the coffee shop guy she took interest in at the beggining of the film?\n\nThank you!",
