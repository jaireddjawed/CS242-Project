        "text": "This happened to the friend of a friend a loooooong time ago. \n\nThe main characters in this story are a man, let's call him Mike, and his father. Their family had a very distinct surname- let's say something like Signorello. I don't remember the exact name, but it was something along those lines.\n\nAnyway, Mike's family was planning a birthday party for a relative who was turning 80 and they asked Mike to take charge of ordering the cake from a local supermarket bakery. Mike was an awkward, shy man and hated the idea of having to deal with the task, but did it anyway to avoid an argument with his family.\n\nHe went to the bakery, placed the order and it was to be picked up in 3 days time for the party, under the name Signorello.\n\nThe day it was supposed to be picked up, Mike got stuck at work and had his father call the bakery to ask if the cake was ready and what time they closed so someone could arrange to have the cake picked up.\n\nThe market was in an area where a lot of folks do not speak English, which means a lot of retail employees in the area did not speak English.\n\nMike's father called Mike back later that day to say he had the most frustrating experience with the supermarket and that no one should ever order from them again. Below is the exchange he had:\n\nMF= Mike's Father   SE= Supermarket Employee \n\nBE= Bakery Employee\n\n&gt;MF: (calling market) Hi there, can you transfer me to the bakery please?\n\n&gt;SE: Sure! One moment, please.\n\n&gt;BE: Hallo? (thick accent)\n\n&gt;MF: Hi, I'm calling about a cake order my son put in a few days ago, under the name Signorello. We need to pick it up today and I wanted to know what time you close?\n\n&gt;Be:.....um....one moment, please.\n\n&gt;SE: Hello?\n\n&gt;MF: Yes?\n\n&gt;SE: How may I help you?\n\n&gt;MF: I was calling about a cake order for pick up. What time does your bakery close?\n\n&gt;SE: Um, sorry, you were transferred to Deli for some reason. Let me send you to the bakery. Please hold.\n\n&gt;BE: Hallo?\n\n&gt;MF: Yes, I was holding regarding the cake order for Signorello? What time do you close?\n\n&gt;BE: ..erm....please hold.\n\n&gt;SE: Hello, this is SE speaking in Grocery, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;MF: Is there something wrong with your bakery employee?\n\n&gt;SE: Excuse me?\n\n&gt;MF: I have been trying to speak to someone in the bakery about a cake order and they keep transferring me to someone else. \n\n&gt;SE: Sorry, it must have been in error. Let me transfer you.\n\n&gt;BE: Yeess?\n\n&gt;MF: What time do you close? I need to pick up my cake order.\n\n&gt;BE: Was you name, sir?\n\n&gt;MF: Signorello\n\n&gt;BE: ..ehmm....please hold....\n\n&gt;MF: No! No more holds or transfers! I just want some simple information! What is the problem?\n\n&gt;BE: Erm, I sorry. We no have no Cinderella cake!\n\nCLICK\n\nMike's father was furious. He left work early, got in his car and drove to the market and demanded to speak to a manager. They went over to the bakery and requested the employee who had hung up on him and he recognized the woman's voice instantly because of her accent. When the manager asked her why she had hung up, she said that she had informed the customer that they did not make \"Disney Princess cake.\"\n\n&gt;MF: I never said 'Cinderella cake,' I gave you my last name! Signorello! \n\n&gt;BE: .....(blank stare)\n\n&gt;Manager: I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding, sir.\n\n&gt;MF: I don't mean to be rude, but if your employee doesn't speak English well enough to assist with even basic information, perhaps she shouldn't be the one answering the phone.\n\n&gt;Manager: You're absolutely right. I will see to it that she receives some additional training.\n\nMike's dad got his cake and left.\n\nI still crack up every time I remember this story.",

I know what it’s like to be treated like less than trash so consequently, I’m always extra friendly to any servicepeople I interact with, even though my husband insists I’m going to end up with a stalker.\n\nOnce, I was at an antique store making a purchase, and the cashier asked if I wanted to run my card as debit or credit. I said debit and completed my purchase.\n\nSuddenly, I kid you not, he goes absolutely pale and looks at me in a panic.\n\nC: “Oh no... I... I ran your card as credit, I’m so sorry-“\n\nMe: “Oh it’s ok! No big-“\n\nC: “I can run a refund if you like, I’m really sorry, that was my fault, you asked for debit-“\n\nAt this point, I place my hand on the counter, lean forward, and smile, and say “Hey. I work in customer service too. I know what it’s like behind the counter. It’s ok.”\n\nThe poor kid finally relaxed. It just breaks my hears when people react like this because you know they’ve been verbally abused and treated like shit for even less. It’s like watching an abused dog cower in fear when someone slams a car door. \n\nI have a couple other stories like this too, but just wanted to share this one today :)",

        "text": "So this happened yesterday when I was too lazy to cook and decided to use this new delivery app I downloaded a while back. \n\nIt's not a general shop delivery app like another one I have, it's specific to a pizza chain. I put in my order, which in itself was shit because it froze often, it would just lose my order (which would seem to only happen if I *didn't* tap the \"meal\" option that gives me a drink and a side with the pizza) and for some reason it wouldn't accept my completely valid card, so I had to scratch around for cash in my flat. But all of this was worth it when I realised I could ask them to write/draw something on the box. I asked for a picture\n\nFinally I complete the order. Now what? There's no tracking option, no approximate indication of how long it'll take, no receipt or anything. Okay fine, maybe they just haven't set that up yet. \n\nThe guy gets there hour and a half later and right off the bat starts telling me about how little his job pays. Maybe he had a bad day and needed to vent, and he seems like a decent dude. As it gets time to hand over the cash I give him about a 7 or 8% tip. Not much, but its all I had on me. \n\nHe looks at me as if he expects me to start looking for more money or say anything about the tip. Then he tells me how he has to pay for his own airtime and how badly the managers treat him, but this time I can hear that he's begging. But at \"You gave me small tip(sic), but I still don't have enough for tomorrow.\" I kinda lost my patience (he's been going for around 10 minutes at this point) and told him to have a nice day, closed the security gate and turned around. I heard him slowly turn around and mumble on his way back to his car. \n\nNah bruv, I can understand your job is shit, but I already gave you a tip, so don't beg for more. I could *maybe* and that's a very negative maybe understood if I didn't tip at all, but fuck you. \n\nAnd fuck the tipping system. My life would be so much easier if I didn't have to worry about that.",

        "text": "So, about a year or so ago my now fiancee and I went to a local pub in the town I live in. (We live in England, up in the North East). It was part of a chain of pubs, and I'd been there a few times since we moved to that town when I was 9. I'd been with my mother and younger sister quite a few times and it was close by, so I figured it would be a nice place to go for our third date.\n\nWe get in and it's around 12pm, it's not very busy in there at all. I think there was one other customer who seemed to be a regular there since the staff were chatting to him. My fiancee and I decided to wait and decide what drinks to get (I was 19 at the time, and my fiancee was 21). Even though the only customers there are us and the elderly regular, we had to wait about 10 minutes to get served. While my fiancee and I are stood there deciding, I notice that one of the servers behind the bar is... staring at me. Well, less staring and more giving me the most shifty look I've ever received. I try to shake it off and I go up with my fiancee to order. We decide to get a cider each, and she's now glaring at both of us. She snaps at my fiancee and wants his ID, which is no problem, he has a provisional drivers license. She almost seemed annoyed with the fact that he was of legal age. Then she demanded to see mine, which didn't bother me. We're young, and she's doing her job, I'd be more concerned if she wasn't checking us for ID. I explained I don't have one, and she told me rather rudely I can't get a cider. That's no problem, so I decide to get a lemonade. My fiancee and I sat down at a table near the bar, and I felt my anxiety rising. (Little note, I hadn't really left my home in about 6 years, I'm terrified of people and if not for my fiancee I'd never leave the house. Another note, the legal age to buy alcohol in a pub or at a store is 18). I keep feeling anxious and I can't bring myself to drink, before looking up and noticing... the lady who served us is staring at me. She's stood with her arms folded and glaring at me. She's only about a meter away from us and I start to panic, wondering what I've done wrong for her to look at us like that. Since she's in earshot, and my fiancee is playing on his phone, I take out my phone and text him.\n\nMe: Mike? (Not his real name) Can you look to your right please? She's making me anxious.\n\nHe looks confused and looks over, noticing the woman walking away. \n\nMike: What's wrong?\n\nMe: She's been glaring at us since we came in.\n\nMike looks a bit concerned and talks to me to try and calm me down. Since she's gone, I continue drinking my lemonade and he starts to finish his cider. We then look up and notice the lady who served us, and another co-worker, stood nearby and frowning at us and talking quietly to each other. I can't take much more of the anxiety so I ask Mike if we can leave. He says sure and asks If I want to finish off the small amount of cider he has left... the womans co-worker gave him the biggest death glare I've ever seen and said, \"If she has no ID, she can't have alcohol.\" \nWell, that's wrong for starters, I just can't purchase alcohol without ID. You can have alcohol with a meal if you're at a minimum of 16, and we had bought some chips to eat. (Potato chips, not crisps) \n\nIn the end, we both got up and left with the server seeming to follow us as we went to the door. As we left I could hear her tutting to a co-worker.\n\nMa'am, if you ever read this (I doubt you will), you made that day awful for me to experience and I'm not sure why you were watching us the whole time. I understand you have to check ID, that's not a problem which is why I got some lemonade instead. But we had been polite and I really do mean that. We waited for 10 minutes in an empty pub to talk to a server, because we didn't want to interrupt you talking to the elderly gentleman or your co-workers. \n\nTLDR: Went out with boyfriend, got glared at by staff the whole time.",

        "text": "Sorry for the formatting I'm on my phone blah blah blah.\n\nSo a few weeks ago my dad and I went to our local grocery store. I have to say that it is the only grocery store in town and its usually very busy. My dad has Mondays off so we decided to go on a Monday morning. We thought maybe it would be less busy in the morning and on a weekday. We were wrong.\n\nBut anyways, we had a lot of groceries that we needed to get. We live with two other people and we were shopping for everyone. By the end of the shopping trip, our cart was literally full to the max. Like there wasn't even room for 1 more item. We get into line and I start placing all the items on the counter for the lady to ring up. As I'm doing this, my dad's talking to the cashier while helping bag things up. I was extremely busy because we had so many items and there was a line forming behind me. I even have to give props to the cashier because she was quicker at scanning than I was at placing the items on the counter. She was almost done ringing everything up when my dad asked me to get money out of my purse for the payment. I was still adding items to the counter so it took me a second to get the cash. I gave my dad $80  (that's all I could pitch) and he took it and proceeded to pay. While he was paying I finally finished adding every item to the counter. The cashier finished ringing up and the payment went through. \n\nWe were on our way home with a ton of groceries in the back. We put them all away and then started to relax a little. A short while later, my dad was looking at the receipt when he noticed something weird. Our total had come to about $340 yet he only payed $140 on his card plus the $80 that I gave him. So we should have still owed them $120. \n\nWe realized that the cashier accidently rang my $80 as $200. We felt pretty bad. I had an appointment but my dad went back to the store to let them know. I guess he first went to customer service where the worker was extremely confused to what he was trying to say. He had to talk to a few other workers before someone understood what he was saying. They had the cashier who rang us up come up front and they figured out how to fix the situation. The cashier was so greatful to my dad she kept saying \"thank you\" and \"you saved me so much trouble\". I guess she thought we handed her 4 $50's instead of 4 $20's.",

        "text": "A few days ago my wife and I stopped at a restaurant we rarely visit.  We go there so seldom because the service is always v - e - r - y   s - l - o - w.  It’s a national chain (3 words, 2 of which rhyme), and every one I’ve been to has had the same lackadaisical approach to seating and waiting on customers.\n\nWell, on this Sunday afternoon the place was a little more than half full.  We stood by the “Please wait to be seated” sign and we waited.  And waited.  Finally, the young guy who was working the grill gestured toward the counter seats (There were only four, all empty.) and said, “If you want to sit here, I can take care of you.”  We said, “Thanks,” and sat down.\n\nHe took our orders, punched them into the computer, and continued working the grill.  He was really cranking stuff out, by the way.  About five minutes later, a waitress came up and asked if our orders had been taken.  Of course, we said they had.  She left, and we heard some agitated conversation in the back of the house.  It quickly became clear that the waitress was raising a stink about the guy taking our order.  Mind you, by the time she had acknowledged our existence, we had been in the place for ten minutes, our burgers (make that our s---kburgers) were on the grill, and our orders were half-ready.\n\nThis kvetching went on for quite a while.  An older male employee came up to the young guy and started explaining to him that it was important for the waitresses to be able to get their tips.  (As if someone working in a restaurant wouldn’t be aware of that.)\n\nAll of this went on within our hearing and that of many of the other customers in the place.  Anyway, we told the young guy repeatedly that we appreciated him taking care of us.  We left him a good tip after making sure that he would be the one to get it.  And on the way out I repeated to him the old line, “No good deed goes unpunished,” in a voice that I hoped was just loud enough to reach the waitress station.\n\nI would complain about this to the corporate office, but I’m honestly afraid that if I identify the location, the grill guy might get in trouble.  The corporate culture seems to place no value whatsoever on prompt service, and this who-cares approach might really be SOP.  How else to explain not only the lousy service, but the public embarrassment of an employee who actually goes out of his way to provide *good* service?\n\nSo I wanted to vent, and now I have.",

Twelve minutes and there's no one else in line, with most people just getting their drinks and leaving within a few minutes. Fifteen and the employee recognizes I'm standing in front of him looking at the various drinks to see if any were mine, there were maybe 7 drinks and 3 food items (keep in mind, there are maybe 4-5 people in the store including me). \n\n\nHe asks me if I'm looking for anything, I tell him I ordered tea. He stares at me for a minute before checking each of the drinks and politely giving me my tea. I then proceed to ask about the cookie I ordered (the third item) and he just stares at me, mouth agape. I'm not sure if he was gonna say something or what but for what felt like a good minute his mouth was just open, not saying anything. I, politely, asked him again if there was a cookie coming out of the oven. He says \"what?\" and continues to stare at me. I wasn't given a receipt, so I can't prove anything.\n\n\nStressed out from classes and having a deadline in an hour I just told him it wasn't a big deal and walked out without my full order. There were now 9 drinks on the table, and 3 customers in the shop, including me.\n\n\n",

        "text": "I got married a few years ago and had a pretty big wedding with obviously some large costs. We had found a DJ service that also provided a photobooth as well as limo service, bundled together was significantly less than booking with separate services so we were totally cool with that. Their online reviews had been excellent and our DJ (who also was the one that did our booking and covered the details and whatnot of the contract) was awesome and I felt very confident that we would have a great night.\n\nThe night went great of course, my husband and I were happy newlyweds and had a fantastic night with our family and friends. But there were a few little details I noticed throughout the night that bothered me a little - but being that it was my wedding night I didn't really want to get into it. The limo wasn't exactly as promised. It was big enough for us and the wedding party - but there was no sound system, no way to listen to any music except the radio. Not a big deal - church isn't too far. The photobooth attendant was a teenage girl - which was totally fine - but she kept walking away from the booth and my guests would have trouble with the machine and she wasn't there to help, and our photobooth album was also our \"guest book\" so we really wanted everyone to sign it. It's okay- most people did and the pics turned out fun! I had given my DJ a list of \"Must\" and \"Must not\" play songs - the first song he played was on my \"must not\" list and I was annoyed but whatever I went on and talked to guests and danced and ate. Of course the night goes on and I realize I hadn't heard a majority of my \"must\" songs. There is about 15 minutes left of the reception and I tell him we need to play this song, and he tells me he can't - the groom's Mom wanted to hear this other song (a country song - I hate country music, I specified country music as a general no for the night). Okay whatever - I'm just enjoying the night and my new hubby and I are smitten.\n\nA few weeks later I get my reminder email to \"not forget to review us!\" So I did. And I was very honest in my review, it was mostly positive and just pointed out the few things that bothered me. I think I gave 3.5/5 stars. \n\nNot 24 hours later I get a call from them, saying \"hey I thought we had a great time! Why the bad review?\" and I explained the things again. He ended the conversation by asking me \"well, it would be nice if you could take down the review, we don't want any future customers to be discouraged and not book with us.\"\n\nUmmm...wtf? Isn't that the point of a review? For customers to share experiences with potential customers? \n\nThe next day I get a follow up email from them, again saying \"per our conversation yesterday, you said you would take down the review and we would appreciate if you did.\" I ignored it and certainly did not take it down.\n\nTwo weeks later- the DJ calls my HUSBAND. Talks to my husband about the review, how I am not remembering the night correctly because I was so drunk, they did all the things that we asked, blah blah (I actually don't drink at all - I can't handled my booze no matter how little - and I didn't want to be sick on my wedding day). \"Can you ask her to take it down?\" My husband - knowing me very well - told them \"Well, AprilsMay is pretty stubborn, once she is set on something she isn't changing her mind. Also I don't appreciate you calling her a drunk - she didn't have a sip of alcohol all night.\" And the DJ asked him - \"Hey you're a pretty cool dude, can't you maybe find her password and change it?\" Of course at this point my husband said to just F*** off.\n\nI was livid after hearing this. I never changed the review, but I did add to it after this experience. I told some friends of mine about this experience as well, one engaged friend of mine had booked with them and cancelled after hearing this. I also contacted the wedding review website - because they pride themselves on verified reviews. I'm not sure how many of the reviews they actually have are real at this point or if they bullied anyone less than 5 stars and they actually removed it. I like to think I had something to do with it, but this was over 5 years ago and the company is now out of business.\n\nIf you have more than a hundred 5 star reviews - is it really worth fighting down the one 3.5 star that is there? \n\n\nEdit:\nWOW this got a lot more attention that I thought! \nJust wanted to add: while I did list several of things that were a bother to me that night, the remaining 3.5 stars were because the service did provide some extra assistance to use that night. The limo driver took us home (they were waiting to help the DJ tear down equipment and dropped us off since we were on the way), he also had to re-route us to the wedding due to an accident on the regular route and we still made it on time, the DJ was also great at getting people up on the dance floor and providing a good time for my guests. \n\nI'm a very passive person and generally don't like to get into conflict - and on my wedding day I didn't want to be that Bridezilla that caused a scene about her music! Although in hindsight I should have stopped my MIL from her song - at the time I was still trying to be a good DIL, that has changed since then!\n\nI did add to the review about my harassment experience but was unable to change the actual star rating myself unless I wanted to delete it totally. With contacting the wedding website I think they might have exploited the problem of the DJ getting negative reviews removed, or also very likely - creating fake 5 star reviews of himself. Either way - it's gone and done now, and they are no longer in business. This was almost 5 years ago now!",

Cross posted to r/talesfromretail because I thought it was appropriate, but since I was the customer/witness I am also putting it here. 2 years later I still shake my head about this encounter.\n\nI was at Staples getting my dad’s old diving certifications re-laminated (for a keepsake). There was one girl at the Service station working on something, and one girl who came to help me. This Staples also had a “Self Serve” area with computers and printers for people to use. Crazy Lady (CL) was in the self serve area with a guy and trying to use a computer. She came up to the side counter and stood there, but didn’t say a word.\n\nCustomer Service Girl (CSG) did my laminating job, which took all of 10 minutes. Meanwhile CL is getting visibly agitated. Finally, as I am finishing paying, CL starts screaming at poor CSG things like “well are you going to come and help me? I’ve been waiting!”\n\nCSG tells CL that she didn’t realize CL needed help, as she was *in the self serve area*. And also didn’t ask for any help. So of course CL goes off, yelling about how she clearly needed assistance (I agreed, but probably not the kind of assistance CSG could give her) and how CSG was ignoring her and being a rude c&amp;nt. Literally called this nice girl a c&amp;nt. For not psychically knowing she needed help. In the self serve area.\n\nA manager hears Crazy Lady yelling and comes over to investigate. He tells CL to calm down, which she doesn’t, and listens to both sides. He then tells CL she has to leave because he won’t tolerate abuse of his employees. The guy CL was there with basically had to drag her out of the building, all the while she is muttering under her breath about rude people ignoring her on purpose (I overheard as she stomped past me).\n\nPost Script - manager tells CSG to go on a break because she was visibly upset and shaken. He stays there, and the other girl who was doing the other task was there, so she leaves to the employee area in the back. I made sure to call over the manager when I could get his attention and let him know that CSG did a wonderful job helping me and that CL was just... crazy.\n\nEdit - used ** to censor and forgot they would create italics 🤦‍♀️",

        "text": "My story begins last week.  My husband was on a work trip and had been gone for about three weeks.  I was doing fine juggling my two jobs and two children until Saturday when my seven year old son suddenly became ill.  He was sick until Sunday night and I chose to keep him home Monday just in case.  Then Tuesday I dropped him off at school only to receive a call that he was now running a high temperature.  I left work and picked him up and took him home.  With some medicine his fever went away and he seemed fine.  I decided to keep him home Wednesday just to be safe and made an appointment with his doctor for Thursday to have him tested for the flu.  \n\nHowever, at 4 am Wednesday morning I woke up to both my kids screaming in a panic.  After a mini heart attack I discovered my 7 year old son on the floor next to his bed and the right side of his face was swollen.  He seriously looked like the hunchback of Norte dame.  He was sobbing because he climbed out of bed to use the bathroom and his legs hurt so much he couldn't stand.  I immediately put him in the car and took him to the emergency room.  If I had known what was about to happen I would have never gone.  \n\nI carried him in and the nurses asked what was wrong.  I explained that he woke up with a swollen face and his legs hurt so much he couldn't stand.  The nurse checked us in and we waited in the empty waiting room for about ten minutes. Finally a nurse came and took us in back.  As I was walking to the room we passed the nurses station and one of the nurses said \"WOW that's a big shiner he has!\"  Once in the room the nurse asked how he fell.  What?  There was no fall he woke up this way and he has been sick something is wrong.  \n\nShe looks at me and rolls her eyes and says the doctor will be in soon.  She leaves and about five minutes later another nurse comes in and asks how he hurt his face.  I once again say \"He woke up this way he's sick\".  She leaves then a security officer comes in and asks how he hurt his face.  I'm livid at this point and demand to see the doctor.  Finally the doctor comes in and starts asking how he fell and hit his face.  I looked at her and told her that there was NO fall he didn't hit his face.  She then asks him how he hurt his face and my son tells her his face doesn't hurt but his legs do.  She then finally looked at him and sent out for a couple of tests.  He came back positive for flu and a bacterial infection in his face. \n\nMy son has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis which means that he can have severe reactions to certain medications.  For example he's allergic to Benadryl.  So the doctor tells me she's putting him on an antibiotic and sending us home. I told her no. First antibiotics will make him sick and his legs are already hurting so he needs steroids with his antibiotics because that is what his doctor always does. She tells me I don't know what I'm talking about and he will be fine.  I still refuse.  That is when she says his infection is serious and if I don't allow her to treat it she will call the officer back. I'm adamant I don't want him to have the antibiotics.  I finally caved when she assured me that they would watch him for an hour and if he had no problems she would send him home.  I agreed.  An hour later he was still fine so we left.  Three hours later he was running a 102 temperature, covered in hives and screaming in pain.  I took him immediately to the critical care and not to the ER.  \n\nThe doctor looked at him and informed me he was having a massive arthritis flare up because of the antibiotics. She gave him steroids and within an hour he was walking and had no fever and the hives started going away.  The next morning we saw his regular doctor when we walked in the nurse looks at his chart and says I see he had a fall yesterday.  The ER hadn't even changed the reason for his visit. The doctor apologized and said he would put it in his chart to always have steroids with antibiotics or no antibiotics at all.  \n\nThen yesterday the hospital called me to ask about my experience.  I started telling the lady on the phone and she cut me off and said \"I'll let my supervisor know\". And hung up on me.   \n\nTl:dr Son became very ill and hospital bullies me thinking I beat him and then gives him medicine against my advice and doesn't listen causing extreme pain and worse sickness.

I've worked for this company before and know for a fact the hashbrowns take 1 minute and 30 seconds to cook in the oven.\n\nSo we're at the drive thru, girl is pleasant and asks for our order and we tell her 2 orders of hash browns. We hear in the background another female employee yelling \"are you fucking kidding me?! Tell them the ovens are off! I don't feel like making them!\" You can hear everything over those headsets. The girl taking the order maintains her composure and tells us \"no problem! Please pull forward\"\n\nWe do and we see her other coworker throwing a fit, flinging her arm in our direction looking pissed off. The window opens as the nice employee approaches it and we can hear the other one saying \"...and I TOLD you to tell them no! You need to fucking listen.\" And stomps off. The nice employee looks embarrassed. I think maybe she was new.\n\nThe jerk comes up with our order and flings the bag at the new girl. She hands it to us and at this point I'm so ticked off by the behavior. I say, \"thank you so much for being so friendly. Your coworker however is an ASSHOLE.\" I say it loud enough so the other girl hears me and she just stares with her mouth open. The nice girl kind of chuckles and we head on our way. Not my proudest moment but hey. If the shoe fits.\n\nAs I said before, I worked for this company before and policy is anyone can order hot food up to 10 minutes til closing so there's time to wipe down and sanitize the ovens. We ordered a half hour beforehand. I think maybe they broke policy and cleaned up everything to leave early and she got pissed when we made it so they had to be cleaned again. Or maybe she really was that lazy . Oh well.\n\nI emailed the store manager that night and haven't been back to that store since.\n",

As soon as he got there Liar told them that they could not do the procedure at that location, and they told us the the ONLY place that it could be done was over 2 hours away. The procedure needed to be done, so they did the drive and got the procedure done. On their way home his wound started bleeding, everywhere. So, my parents figured he best move was to go back to Liar and have him cauterize the wound. They go back, and Liar does is give them a gauze pad and tell them he can’t do anything, so they quickly drive to the nearest ER and in less than 5 minutes the ER has the wound cauterized and wrapped and they are on their way. Later on, we figured out that there in fact is a dermatologist that could have done the original surgery, who was less than 10 minutes away! Liar told us the nearest one was 2 hours away to keep our business within the same company! So my step dad starts going to the closer dermatologist instead, and he informs them that the original dermatologist could have cauterized the wound on, and we have no idea why he didn’t! \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago, my brother hears this story for the first time, and he is understandably pissed over this, and he figures out my parents didn’t leave a review, so he just decides that he is going to leave a 1 Star review to inform people that we had a terrible experience, he forgets about this review and moves on. My brother works in real estate, and he was just doing his job about a week ago, and his boss asks if he can talk to him. my brother agrees and heads into his office to talk. During this talk, my brother figures out that Liar and his workers stalked my brother on Social media, and that they threatened to stop all business with my brothers company if the review wasn’t taken down! So they put my brothers job on the line, all over a very accurate 1 Star review!\n\nEdit: apparently, this sort of thing happens a lot with this company! Lots of reviews talk about how this company stalked them on social media and tried to make them take the review down. ",

Get this phone and get this deal, get this most expensive phone because everyone loves doing this with it and we’re sure you will too!\n\n2 was the fact that the whole process of transferring was confusing and I still don’t understand it. So company a is still gonna charge me and I’ll be paying company b bill as well? I thought company b pays off company a and there is no more company a bill. \n\n3 the person we talked to for 1 1/2 hours then passed us off to another employee, not explaining to us why and then employee b was having a very hard time transferring us because I guess company a is an ass. \n\nSo after 2 1/2 hours, all is done and we go home. My fiancé explains how upset he is and I of course scream at him. I’ve been holding in all of my anger and I asked him ten times if he was sure that he wanted to switch to Android and ten times he told me yes. \n\nSo two or three days later, he writes a scathing review to them. And we get a call from the manager. And my lovely fiancé never calls back. Now let’s be honest, he was upset because I was in the hospital and that’s why he didn’t call the manager back. \n\nWhen I’m finally well, after a week, we go back to the store to trade in for our good old friend Apple. \n\nAnother 1 1/2 later, we have our apples back. But here’s what transpired and I wonder if this is correct to do. \n\n\nSame employee a did the transfer with same employee b this day. Employee a immediately brings up fiancés bad review. Calls fiancé out on not calling manager back. Then explains that he passed us off because he can’t sell us the phone because he’s a manager. Okay, I hear ya, I get it. So now my fiancé who suffers from his own mental things is having a panic attack because he feels ambushed. And now I’m getting pissed because he put my fiancé in this state. I say “well depending on how this goes, I can just give you a good review”. He says, “no you can’t, damage is done.” \n\nSo we have spent 4 hours with someone who made us feel like assholes. And I understand, but where I come from, if I did that to a customer, I would be screamed at by my boss. I would be fired. Then that’s all my fiancé and I talked about the rest of the night, because how he calms down is rehashing everything until it makes sense. So I had to listen to it all night because I’m supportive. And now I don’t even want to give a review to these people. \n\nThanks for the rant. ",

So she asks what size would he want and he said-\"I'll choose thank you\" then she says again what size does he want and he says again-\"I'll choose it myself thank you for your help\" so I thought who doesn't get embarrassed by thing like that especially if the employee is a women. So she said that he wouldn't be able to find his size cause there were a lot of models there so finally he says he wants the Jockey's Elance and she hands over the S size. So he says that's not my size and she says-\"Don't worry it'll fit\" and then he says-\"Can you pls bring an L in this?\" And she begins to say -\"Oh but that won't fit you. Why don't you buy an S?\" So he gets angry and says-\"Look! I know my size so can you hand over what I'm saying?\" She then without saying anything goes and grabs a box and gives it to her and he says-\"This is an M! I said I want an L!\" So she says the L wouldn't fit him and this was perfect. Now he gets really annoyed and says-\"You hear the words coming out of my mouth! I said an EhhhhLLLLL!\" She says it's not in the store and he clearly knows she's lying so he looks around for a bit and finds it and asks her what is this? And she says -\"Im just doing the good thing for ya. You wouldn't want that falling off ya tiny waist all the time would ya\" This teenager then says in a nearly crying voice-\"Whats your fucking problem! I'm 16 I know what I'm doing. How dare you fucking assume my size and tell me what I need when you clearly don't have any idea!\" So then a guy besides me decides to join in their conversation and say-\"Hey buddy chill out. She's probably handing you her husband's size\" at which point I and the guy burst out laughing. The employee just walks off from there. So then he says-\"I have to deal with this shit because 165\" I don't just get this batshit the lady was trying to pull off. I know the customers aren't always right but jeez. ",

My mom and I go to Martwall and pick up a cheap pair of shoes. I tried on the one size that didn't fit quite well, so it was clear that we needed to get the next size up. Thinking it was cut and dry, we pick up the box, without trying them on, pay, and leave. This particular year I was to spend two weeks at the camp. I had everything packed, including the unopened box of shoes, and went on my merry way for childhood summer fun. \n\nNow, I want to say that the shoes did indeed fit. But what perplexed the young me was that the box had two left shoes. I ended up wearing them for the whole week. It wasn't the most comfortable but you make due with what you've got. I told my mom who then went back to the store to get the same shoes, same size, but another box. She comes to see me at the end of the first week, we exchange boxes, everything was fine. Right?\n\nWell, you'll never believe it, but the new box of shoes ended up being two right feet, which I ended up wearing for the rest of my time there. And I ended up with a good tale to tell.\n\nMoral of the story? Always make sure you check what you are buying before you leave the store. \n",

I decided that she would probably be able to handle a juice box, though.\n\nI pull up to the speaker and order a large Diet Coke for myself, a medium Sprite for my oldest daughter, and a juice box. The person taking my order could not understand what a juice box is. I kept saying, ”It is like a drink you can get with a happy meal. It is juice.”\n\n“You want a happy meal toy?”\n\n”No, I want a juice box. I think the brand is Honest?” I would have specified apple juice, but I couldn’t remember if they did apple or some kind of fruit punch version.\n\nFinally, I gave up in exasperation. I just ordered the two drinks for myself and my eldest daughter, and, as I waited to get the payment window, I pulled open my app to look at the menu.Right there, under drinks, was the juice box.\n\nI asked the young guy at the payment window, who was not the person that took my order, if they indeed had these juice boxes, and I showed him the picture from my app. He said yes and seemed surprised that the other employee had no idea what I was talking about. He added it to my order, I made it to the second window, and got my stuff.\n\nIt wasn’t a big deal in the grander scheme of things, but it is frustrating when you know that a restaurant carries something, and an employee argues with you that they do not.",

This was me thinking hey lets get a warranty from the seller on top of the parts warranty and have a \"professional\" build the computer instead of myself building it. \n\nI first decided to go all out on the computer and the only thing that was not the top of the line item was the processor and that's because i saw little in the difference from the top tier processor to the second tier processor. Grabbing all the bells and whistles that would fit a computer of this magnitude. 1080ti sound card new monitor mechanical keyboard new mouse you name it i bought it and added. (thank you for being single and living at your parents) \n\nI had to wait about three weeks for this beast to arrive. Upon arrival the first sheet i see states to carefully open the computer case and remove the giant foam piece that is in the computer and ensure all connections and components are secure in the computer. \n\nTHIS is when it gets good i found a cable that looks like it was superglued together. in addition the cable management (that i paid extra for) looked like absolute crap and a third grader could have made a better showing of it. I immediately called the customer service help desk to determine the course of action that should be taken as this is extremely poor workmanship. The customer service Rep told me that the melted plug MUST have happened when i powered the computer on. As i have yet to power the computer on i immediately say that no that is not possible because i have yet to power the computer on. Customer Service Rep believes this is impossible (most end users lie about this) I reply to the rep hey why not just check the logs on the computer compared to the metadata on the picture i sent you. Usually when you can start speaking in Jargon it freaks the reps out and you move on from there extremely fast. \n\nIt is at this point that i also point out i can't access two of the display ports on the graphics card as well. Customer service believes this as well. The Rep bumps me up to manager without having to ask me as they realize i have them in a vice and are tightening it ever more the longer the rep does not help me out. \n\nThe manager at least realize that oh shit this person realizes we screwed up and hard. We will pay for shipping, and have the computer back to you with in the week. \n\nUnlucky for me i had to leave for work at this point (figures right) and was unable to play it at all while i was working, at least when i went to inspect it when i returned home the computer had beautiful cable management, an extra rbg strip, and even had the other component that was left free hanging corrected.",

        "text": "I get a job at a gas station. My thrid day in they have me working alone during the rush hours on a register I barely knew how to work because they were understaffed. That was stressful. And doubly so because they never got around to showing me any of the training videos for dealing with emergencies and that's all I could think about. After rush hour my coworker showed up on schedule while I was in the back stocking the fridge with more beer and soda. I come out and say hi. She was in her 50's with a tough and heavy North Eastern accent and attitude. She's immediately cold to me and I didn't know why so I just turned up the friendly charm. I needed more training and I was determined to get it from anyone and everyone that worked there. \"You're fast on that cash register, would you give me a few pointers on it? I'm slow as molasses with it so far.\"  \"No. Go do something else.\" is all I get from her. The thing was, I didn't know how to do anything other than blunder through the register menus and empty and clean the coffee pots and stock the freezer. So I go in the back and wash some of the coffee pots I found sitting in the sink. When I'm done I come back out and add more creamer cups to those trays for customers. \n\n\"Did you just clean those coffee pots?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I ALREADY DID THOSE! What is my work not good enough?\" I'm confused at this point so I give her all of my attention.\n\n\"I don't know. They were in the sink so I thought they were there to get cleaned.\" I didn't add that they were dirty enough that I couldn't tell they were just cleaned.\n\n\"What, is my work not good enough? Are you checking on my work now? Are you trying to steal my job, is that it? They want to replace me, huh?\"\n\n\"What? No. I'm just looking for things to do.\" I go back to filling creamer cup trays hoping she'll let it go. \n\n\"Don't come around here acting like a big shot! I've been here for years and I do good work. Don't get comfortable and think you're gonna replace me.\" Already being stressed out after the rush hour alone I couldn't keep hearing this for the rest of my shift. \n\n\"Listen, I don't care about those damn coffee pots. I'm not here to steal your job. I have no clue what I'm doing because I've barely been trained and one of the only things I know how to do is clean those pots. So I cleaned them. Lay off. If you want me to do something other then coffee pots, teach me but I'm not gonna be yelled at and accused for doing my job.\"\n\nWe didn't talk much the rest of the shift but the next day, she was cool. Neither of us held a grudge and we just clicked and never had an issue after that. She said I reminded her of her boys, which is funny because I guess they argue back like I did to her when she gets too pushy lol. But she really loved her boys and talked about them often so I was honored at that compliment. She quickly became the one person I always looked forward to being on shift with. She didn't take shit from anyone and worked harder than anyone there even on her bad joints. I wish I had gotten her number and stayed in contact because she's someone I think would have made a great friend for life. ",

        "text": "Hey guys! I don’t usually drink much coffee at all, but last night I had to use the wifi at my local Starcoffeplace to set up my new phone. I decided to go ahead and order a tall DECAF caramel macchiato , as they sadly no longer had pumpkin spice syrup. I have a severe sensitivity to caffeine. I’m not sure I would call it an allergy, but I cannot tolerate caffeine at all. I cannot drink soda, I most certainly cannot drink energy drinks, but I do occasionally enjoy a decaf Coffee. If I drink caffeine, even just a small amount,  I start to shake, sweat, my heart beats fast, and my vision starts to change. I start feeling very strange. It’s almost akin to an out of body experience. I feel like I’m just not 100% there. On top of that, it causes me extreme gastrointestinal distress. I am also breastfeeding and shouldn’t be having caffeine regardless. \n\nAnyway when I ordered the coffee, I made sure to mention very clearly that I needed for it to be decaf. I sat down and started working on my phone. Within 15 minutes, the symptoms of caffeine ingestion started creeping up on me. Mind you, those symptoms occur if I drink a quarter cup of caffeinated coffee, and I had killed the whole thing. Long story short, I was miserable all night, and seriously felt like I was half way to my grave. \n\nI know what you’re thinking....why go to a coffee place if you have this bad of an intolerance? Well, because I have never had an issue before. I have ordered decaf form this place dozens of times, and have never, ever had a problem. I am always fine just drinking decaf. \n\nNow, I’m scared to go back to this coffee place. It’s in the grocery store I shop at literally every day, and I honestly don’t know if I should say something about it. I know at least if I do go back, I’m going to double and triple check that they understand the decaf thing. There’s nothing they can do to change what happened, but at the same time I feel like they should be made aware that a mistake like this can have severe consequences for people. I myself am a server at a restaurant, and I always take allergies and even preferences seriously. It bums me out a little bit that this happened to me. I know it was an accident and I do not expect to be compensated in any way, but I feel like they should probably know that it’s really not an OK mistake to make. Has anyone else had anything similar to this happen to them? ",

Someone else can help you, IF they can”.

        "text": "BACKGROUND:So this happened like an hour ago. Our Hotel has a few Direct Bills with companies in the area that stay with us all the time. And before they are allowed to be used we have to know what the charges are for specifically because if the company were to put \"Room and tax only.\" then we have to separate the incidental charges so that the person staying has to pay for anything in our sweet shop or any damages made to the property. \n\nSo this woman comes in from one of the local businesses from around here and for whatever reason she doesn't like to give us her CC whenever she comes in for incidentals. We've told her on multiple occasions that her card only has a 25 dollar hold during the stay and it drops off shortly after and that it is something we have to have to check her into the room because her Direct Bill only covers her room and tax.\n\nShe does not believe this fact for some reason \n\nShe fights with us saying \"I never get incidentals so why do you need my card.\" We tell her \"Just in case of any property damages it's just one of our safety precautions. She usually gives up after complaining about how that isn't fair but today she comes in spitting nonsense about how her job told her not to give us her CC for the incidentals. I instantly know this is bull crap because her direct bill leaves a note in our system that it is only for Room and Tax. \n\nMy coworker explains what we've told this woman literally 3 or 4 times from her previous stays but she isn't having it. She keeps saying that her company has a direct bill and that she doesn't ever get anything and she shouldn't have to  give us a CC for incidentals. \n\nI jump in with my co-worker and tell her \"Ma'am we need a card for Incidentals even if you don't get anything that's just policy otherwise we aren't allowed to check you in.\" She looks at me as if I've killed a dog.\n\nShe again rants about how her direct bill should cover everything and I told her \"Ma'am unless your company specified on the direct bill form that it was for all charges then you still need to give us a CC for your incidentals, unfortunately that is our policy and we need the CC to check you in.\" \n\nShe eventually huffs it over to my co-worker but complains about how we shouldn't be allowed to do this. I don't care what she has to complain about I know I'm doing my job right and if her boss calls asking why she still has to give her CC we can always fax them the form that they signed showing where they only marked ROOM AND TAX. I hate it when people fight me about things they know nothing about. ",

It was midnight and that was his last delivery, he called the restaurant and I could hear the manager on the line say \"He already paid, it's all Fanta, what is he complaining about. Tell him the place is closed and come back\".\n\nFor a moment I was ready to kill the delivery man cause I was angry at the entire restaurant, even tho I realized it's probably not the poor delivery man fault. The place was probably really closing and he was eager to go home.\n\nThat's when he said that he was very sorry but the place was closed, but before I could shout all the bad words I know, he said \"I'll go to the gas station a few blocks away and I'll buy your Fanta if that's ok for you. I'm sorry for the rest of the order, I wish I could do something about it\"\n\nI tried to offer him the money to buy it but he said that since I already paid he couldn't accept my money for his restaurants mistakes.\n\nIn the end, he got me the orange soda out of his pocket and apologized. I gave him a nice tip and said \"Don't worry about it\" and he probably won't remember me after today but that guy deserves the Delivery Guy award.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

We ordered 4 entrees because there are 4 of us, chips &amp; guacamole, &amp; two drinks. We are told to pick up the food in 45 minutes.\n\n45 minutes later I take myself &amp; little sister to the restaurant. Once there we see they are crazy busy so I expect a little wait. I’m patient as I have been a waitress &amp; ran to go kiosks. The host tells me it will be about 10 minutes for our food. \n\nWell that 10 minutes turned into 20 minutes. I politely ask about the order and she assured me another 10 minutes. 25 or so minutes later I ask again knowing full well at this point they didn’t even start cooking the food when we called in the order. I get that it’s busy, but come on.\n\nI’m told ANOTHER 10 minutes. But that promise actually sticks. She brings the order out in one bag. Not a big bag, a grocery bag. They stuffed 8 tins (for some reason they put the sides of the entrees in their own tins). And a styrofoam box with chips in that tiny bag. I can see the sauces from the entrees leaking in the bag because they squished them to high heaven.\n\nIt gets worse from here. I know this story is long but it must be told.\n\nNaturally I check the order before leaving. After untying the double knotted bag I find there is no guacamole. I ask the hostess about it showing her the receipt. She gets shitty with me instantly, she sighs and turns around into the kitchen. She came back with a to go ramekin with about 1 tablespoon of guacamole. No lid. \n\nI tell her that’s not worth the 4 dollars I paid for guacamole. I’m done being nice at this point. She goes back into the kitchen and brings out a much better helping of guacamole, except it’s not in a to go container. It’s in a salsa bowl they would serve on a table with chips.\n\nI tell her I want it in a to go container with a lid, and that I want my two drinks as well at this point. She finally at least does the last two things I asked of her, we can finally leave.\n\nWe haven’t been back since. It’s been 2 years now.",

The staff wasn't exactly the friendliest when we first went but we thought maybe they had just had a bad day and gave the place another try. At the time that we went the restaurant was empty other than one other group of diners who came in slightly after us. We sat in our booth for around 45 minutes waiting for the waiter to come by and take our order. My parents were trying their best not to get pissed off saying \"maybe they are just busy.\" even though the restaurant was basically empty. After our order was taken it took around an hour for us to get our food, they gave my mother the wrong order, and a lot of our food was cold and under cooked. My father once again tried to be civil calling over the waiter to tell him about what was wrong but the waiter honestly wasn't very sympathetic and just rudely took care of the problem. All while this was happening it seemed the waiters were only really focusing on this one other group that was slightly larger than ours and honestly I think this is what pissed my dad off the most. He's always lived by the rule of treating people who serve and help you with the most respect that you can because he remembers when he used to work in restaurants and getting yelled at for stuff sucked. When the waiter came back to ask about our check my dad explained that he wasn't satisfied with the service, he once again explained our problems and honestly the waiter still got my moms order wrong after we told him the issues with it, so my dad asked if they had a refund policy at all. The waiter said yes but seemed irritated giving it to us for whatever reason. Before we left my dad told him that he honestly had a terrible time and that he usually would leave a tip for the man but he was just so baffled by how terrible the service was there. We never went back to that restaurant and I'm pretty sure that before we moved from that town it had closed down for some reason or another. ",

She just stood there staring at me and when I moved to another aisle, she followed me. Finally, frustrated, I turned to ask her what her deal was but she beat me to it. \n\n\"Are you going to buy anything?\"\n\n\"I was but...\"\n\n\"If you're not going to buy anything then you should probably leave.\"\n\nI stood there, shocked, and placed the basket I was carrying with a few toiletries I had picked up on a nearby shelf. I know that this store had a high rate of shoplifting, but to treat every customer like a thief boggles my mind. \n\nI made sure to get her name off of the tag on her shirt and when I got to the parking lot I called the manager.

It's about 2 in the morning on a Saturday in a certain fast food joint known to serve a children's meal of a happy nature in a busy area (so you can imagine this place is a little crowded). Tl;Dr at the bottom.\n\nSo in walks a hungry me and a few friends, I've been holding in my pee for a decent half hour so I make a bee line straight for the little boys room making my way through a small crowd of obviously drunk people but as I open the door I accidentally interrupt a group of middle aged men shooting up in front of the bathroom door. I decide that I can probably hold it a little bit longer and go order instead. Now I'm a simple dude that orders the same thing every time, a chicken burger with bacon and cheese so it's pretty specific. After a long wait watching five people who ordered after me I finally get my burger and we head for the car... BUT WAIT! My burger is missing the two specific things that I paid extra for so I head back in explain what's happened to the cashier, he takes my burger and explains that I will have to pay for the extras again since they didn't show up on my receipt for some reason. At this point I cant be assed arguing so I cough up the extra $1.60. Ten minutes later I finally get my burger and head for the car. BUT WAIT AGAIN! Where's the bacon? At this point I'm already angry because some asshole blocked us in at the exit to talk to his friends and I just wanna go home and pee. So I yell out of the window and we head off. \n\nTL;DR: A bunch of dudes getting high on injectables in the bathroom and me getting the wrong order twice.",

We're about 6 hours into a 12 hour car ride, with a 2 year old. Thankfully, we left late in the day so that he'd sleep most of the way. Its about midnight, or a little after, and I'm getting worn out. We swing into a 24-hr restaurant that does generally breakfast type meals, and is always AWESOME. I was specifically looking for this place because its usually so good. And, its midnight, not too many options.\n\nW:waitress F:friends of waitress Me:me\n\nWe park, wake the boy up, and walk through a few guys outside. Long black coats, smoking, whatever. Im hungry, tired, you want to do meth on the corner, cool, i want pancakes and an omelette. W follows us inside and gets us a table. As we walk through the restaurant, we're the only one there. But, when i say \"get us a table\" she literally had to \"clean a table\" for us to sit. She just moved everything off a table, put it on the table behind us, and swept off the crumbs. There are over... 60 tables? and not a single one is clean. My best guess is she is the only one here beside the cook, again, no judging, im hungry. Bring me good food, i could eat surrounded by a fortress of dirty plates and i wouldnt care.\n\nI already know what i want and by the time she gets my order, everyone else is ready. She doesnt have to come back or anything. I'm trying to make life easy for all of us. She goes back, grabs drinks, coffee, and puts the food order in. Then... we dont see her again. We drink everything pretty fast, and i start walking around the restaurant looking for either her, or a place to fill my drink. I find the drink stand and fill it up with water. Im not interested in taking what i havent ordered/paid for. I come back, then refill my wife and son's drink. Chef comes out with the food, plop it down, grunts at us, and leaves.\n\nWe dig in. Omg, amazing food. Just heavenly... was what i was expecting. Its not bad, but i've definitely had better. By this point, im just getting frustrated. I have to get up and refill everyone's drinks, again, etc. we're literally 30 minutes into this meal and i still have zero idea where our waitress is. I've gone everywhere, including the vestibule, and she is nowhere. We finish up, and i'm about to go grab the chef so we can pay and leave. We grab our stuff, wife and son head to the front, and lo and behold, W sticks her head in through the front door and says she'll ring us up in a second. I'm like, sure, whatever, i'm full, coffee woke me up, im irritated, which will help me stay awake, cool. She comes in, followed by 4, 5 of the guys. Maybe they want an omelette too! She inputs my info, and says \"how much are you going to tip me? 20% is about $7.\" Our meal was $35 for all of us, so she isnt wrong. The guys move in closer behind us and i realize that im being intimidated into tipping this chick.\n\nI'm 6'8\", 250 lbs, and dont intimidate well. But im not about to get in a fight over $7. Then, i think of a great way to get out of the situation. See, W seated us near the rear of the restaurant. I said i left a tenner for her on the table. She perks up, i crack a joke about stresses of a servers' life and hope it gets better/shift ends soon. Ha ha ha, we exit. Fast. She makes a beeline for our table. As we pull through the parking lot (we didnt even worry about buckling in our son as my wife, and i to an extent, were pretty worried), i see her looking on the table, under the table, around the table, and nothing. She stands up, and i see her giving me the double middle finger as we pull out of the parking lot.\n\nSeriously though, why in the world would you think we'd pay anything extra. We kept the copy of the receipt for a few weeks, never saw any additional charge over what the meal cost, and we buckled our son in pretty much as soon as we felt we'd gotten a safe distance from the restaurant. I generally tip the $7-$10 range for a $35-40 meal, but have an unclean atmosphere, no service, and sub par food? Nah. No tip for you. I'm 99% sure thats the only time i've never tipped something when eating out.\n",

I had gone to a nail salon for an appointment and afterward decided to stop into a small upscale liquor store for a couple bottles of wine to take to a dinner party that night.\n\nThe shop was small, well-organized, clean and very nicely decorated in a rustic farmhouse theme. It was a pleasant little shop and there were quite a few people shopping there this particular Saturday afternoon.\n\nWhile I browsed their selection, I noticed a small boy of about 7 or 8 years of age trailing me up and down the aisles. He just kept to himself, looking at all the bottles and label art. He didn't touch anything.\n\nAt some point, I made my selection, grabbed two bottles and headed to the checkout. I suddenly heard a crash, yelling and crying. As I came out of the aisle I was in, I saw the small boy crying, a man yelling at him and three broken wine bottles on the floor with a large purple puddle spreading along the floor.\n\nAn employee grabbed a mop and bucket and went to work. The child stood there crying and looking around, presumably for his parent.\n\nAs I walked up to checkout, the man working the register looked at me and loudly said, \"You need to keep a better eye on your kid! I should make you pay for all the bottles he just broke!\"\n\nThe store went deathly quiet and I turned to see who he was speaking to, thinking they were behind me. Lo and behold, he was speaking to me.\n\n&gt;Me: Are you speaking to me?\n\n&gt;Man: I'm looking at you, aren't I?\n\n&gt;Me: He's not my child, sir. Why did you assume he was?\n\nAt that very moment, a flustered man walked in, saw his son crying, shouted \"There you are!\", grabbed him and ushered him out of the store. Everyone just stood there in shock, watching.\n\nThe man at the register locked eyes with me and instantly turned red.\n\n&gt;Me: Who's in charge here?\n\n&gt;Man: I'm the owner.\n\n&gt;Me: I suggest you make sure you have the correct information the next time you decide to run your mouth and lecture someone.\n\nI walked up to the counter and placed the bottles in front of him.\n\n&gt;Me: I won't be needing these.\n\nI turned and walked out without looking back.\n\nLater that day, I left a scathing review of his shop on a review site and the next day, he replied to it, apologizing and asking me to come into the store so he could make things right.\n\nI have never set foot in his store again. He tried to have the review taken down, but was unsuccessful.\n\nEDIT: A few are commenting saying that I’m the bad guy here for leaving a poor review. You were not there. The man was yelling. He yelled at me in front of a store full of people without any clear evidence that I was the child’s parent. I was also the only young woman in the store. The other patrons were much older and mostly male.  Plus, after I got home and looked up reviews for the shop, other people had left negative reviews as well citing rudeness from the owner and-surprise surprise- most of the negative reviews were posted by women.

        "text": "Sit back friends, and let me regale you with the story about the weirdest interaction I've ever had while trying to make a purchase.\n\nBefore I got married, I wanted to ask a couple lovely women to be in my wedding party. Following the trend of \"bridesmaid proposals\" that were becoming more popular at the time, I decided to ask these women to be a part of my special day by presenting them with cake, as it is a well known fact that it's harder for someone to say no to a polite request if you bribe them with cake. I should add that I affectionately call my best friend \"Cookie\", so I decided to \"propose\" with one of those giant cookie cakes from a popular cookie company.\n\nAt the mall nearby there were two of these cookie locations - one was in the heart of the mall and was swamped all the time. The other was tucked away in a corner, was a lot smaller, and normally required less waiting. I figured that I'd have better luck at the smaller, quieter location. Mistake one.\n\nMistake two was calling in my order instead of going to the store directly. I spoke with a very helpful representative who helped me choose a cookie size, icing colour, and we arranged a pick-up date for three days later. The cake was to read \"Be My Bridesmaid?\" and I was certain it was going to be a hit.\n\nI showed up at the location three days later (at the agreed upon time), told them my name, and asked for my cake. The deer-in-the-headlights look I received is one I will never forget. She told me she didn't have any cakes in the back for pick-up, or any orders that were still pending. After some insisting, she went to the decorating table and, lo-and-behold, found my order slip.\n\nI give her credit - she was DETERMINED to make things right once she realized their error. BUT, they didn't have the size I ordered, or the icing colour I wanted. She offered to give me the next size up, free of charge, and I told her I would wait while she decorated it because I was on a timeline (my friend was arriving from out of town that afternoon). I stationed myself on a bench with a clear view of the storefront and waited, watching her go about the business of decorating my cookie cake while still helping the few customers that stopped by.\n\nWhen she beckoned for me to approach the counter, I was hopeful that the cookie cake chaos was coming to a close. Alas, she had only managed to get the border iced. She wanted to confirm, without any doubt, what I wanted the cake to say. \n\nIt told her that it should say \"Be My Bridesmaid\" with a question mark after the word bridesmaid.\n\nShe looked at the cookie for a few seconds and inquired if I wanted the words written across three lines (with each word piled on top of one another). I suggested that it would look more aesthetically pleasing if if she wrote \"Be My\" on one line, followed by \"Bridesmaid?\" on the second, in the middle of the cookie.\n\nShe looked at me, paused for a really long time and then said, and I quote...\n\n\"That doesn't really work for me.\"\n\nWhat else could I respond with other than, \"Well...you're the decorator.\"\n\nIt's been four years, and I still laugh every time I think about it.\n\nThe good news is that the cookie was a hit, my bridesmaid said yes, and I got a pretty amusing anecdote out of it.",

One night for dinner we go out to a chain restaurant that had a slogan at the time that was, \"No rules, just right!\" I remember it was printed on the front of their menus.\n\nOn occasion we would order their kid's menu ice cream sundae . The adult version had nuts in the brownie the sundaes were served with  (which we hated) and these kid sundaes were *huge*. We'd always order three of these suckers to split between the five of us because one was too much for a single person to eat.\n\nOur waitress comes over and smiles and asks us if we're thinking about getting dessert tonight. My dad says, \"We sure are! You guys always have the best ice cream sundaes! We'll take three of the kids ones.\"\n\nThe waitress smiled and said, \"Sir, those are for children only.\"\n\nMy dad smiled back and said, \"I have three kids!\" \n\n\"12 years old or younger? Because that's who the children's menus is for.\"\n\nMy dad, honest to God, reached over and grabbed a menu off the end of the table. He held it up and pointed to the slogan and read it out loud to the waitress, \"No rules, just right!\"\n\nOur waitress turned heel and walked away. We never saw her again. About twenty minutes later the manager came over, threw the ice cream sundae bowls down on the table along with the bill and walked away without saying a word.\n\nEver since then we've always hesitated to order the sundaes. But no one else has ever had a problem with it. We've told our servers the story and they've always been appalled. \n\nI hope that waitress was successful in removing the stick out of her ass.\n\nEDIT: Some of ya'll are Kids Menu Justice Warriors I see. Love it. Don't stop being you Reddit.\n\nEDIT: Kids Menu Justice Warriors /s because sarcasm is as obvious as nuts in a brownie.",

We pile into the car united in the vision of getting some food Right Now.  Do Not Go To Hotel.  Do Not Change Clothes.  FOOOOD!\n\nI pull out my GPS unit (again, a few years ago) and it says that there's a restaurant just around the corner.  Cool!\n\nWe pull up to the restaurant and hand the valet our keys.\n\nWe walk inside.\n\nThe first thing we notice is that the place is packed.  The second thing we notice is that we're the only white guys in the place.  No worries.  We appreciate good food! \n\nThe hostess takes one look at us and very loudly asks, \"And just what in the hell do you boys think you're gonna get here?\"\n\nI just stood there like a deer in the headlights.  My hearing isn't the greatest so I figured I may have misheard.  Surely she didn't say what I thought said, did she?  I looked over John; he was just standing there with a blank expression on his face.  I looked the other way to Ben.  He also looked shocked, but he recovered faster than the rest of us and simply stated, \"Nothing, I guess.\"\n\nMind you, it wasn't like we were four rednecks with Confederate Flag tattoos on our foreheads looking for trouble or something.  We were four middle aged white shlubs in business suits just looking for some grub.\n\nIn any event, at this point we just turned and walked out.\n\nThe kicker was that when we got back outside the valet was waiting for us.  The car hadn't moved.  They hadn't even tried to park it.  They were obviously waiting for us to come back out.  When the door closed behind us the valet gave an exaggerated smile and wordlessly threw the keys to me.\n\nStill one of the biggest WTF moments I've ever experienced.\n",

The store had a little concession area near the front, so I asked my mom if we could get a soda. Mom relented after only a few \"please\"s and gave me a few dollars and told me to find her in the clothing section.\n\nSo I walk up to the counter and the guy behind the till looks a little off to me. I'm a shy kid so I nervously make my request.\n\nMe: Um. Can I um, get a drink?  \nGuy (totally serious): Sorry, I can't sell alcohol to a minor.\n\nAn awkward silence followed. I don't really remember my thought process, but I think it was something like: _Why can't I buy a soda? Wait, alcohol? Oh no, I must have asked for alcohol by mistake! I should have specified a soft drink, and medium. Can he even sell alcohol here?_\n\nMe: Um, can I get a medium soda? Like from the soda fountain. (_point towards the self-serve fountain_)\n\nThe guy didn't speak, or change expressions. He kind of awkwardly grabbed a medium cup, pressed a few buttons on the till and took my money. I got my soda and rushed off to find mom.\n\nIt wasn't until after the fact that I started to really question what happened. Sure phrasing was kind of awkward, but \"drink\" didn't mean alcohol. Plus I was a child and he only sold soda and popcorn. So why did he think I wanted alcohol? In retrospect he looked kind of out of it. Maybe on something, or maybe he was up late working a bar and just got his wires crossed. Either way, I hope he went home and told his friends about the little kid who tried to buy alcohol from him.",

        "text": "This happened about a year ago now, I was living over in the UK for university and tried to get a beer up north and was refused service for the most ridiculous reason. For story telling purposes, it is important to note that I am (by nationality) British. Although, I do sound very American because I've lived overseas for a very long time, this occasionally confuses people when they hear traces of my British accent. \n\n Flash forward to the start of this tale, there was a break from our studies at university; and my housemate knew that I had no plans, so he invited me up to Sheffield to stay with his family. It was all going really well, and I was having a wonderful time. Until late one night, we decided to go into one of the local pubs which he had raved about as having really good ale... I was about to have a masterclass in bar tending disappointment.\n\nI walk in, and I immediately get a very unfriendly weird vibe from this place. I tried my best to ignore it, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of being unwelcome. I try to turn my attention back to the conversation I was having with my housemate, we're both laughing and joking away, which seems to irritate the bartender for some bizarre reason. We order 2 beers and we hand over our ID's when asked, however on this particular night my american accent was quite strong... the bartender hears it and starts eyeing us up and then after a couple moments of silence he says that he believes my ID is fake.\n\nI'm gobsmacked. I've used the same ID all over the country, for years, and never had this problem. Never mind I thought, I'll just try another ID. Same result. At this point I'm getting quite frustrated, I have no idea why this guy doesn't want to serve me, I've done nothing wrong and the ID's I've given him are perfectly legit. Not only that, but he then denied service to my housemate as well despite him, also having valid ID. Our requests for further explanation are denied, and we leave in disgust and frustration. \n\n Immediately afterwards, we went to the next pub over where our ID's were checked, no alarms were raised, and we had a merry old night. I'm still unsure as to why the barkeep at the other insisted on losing business, but my sneaking suspicion is that he heard my accent and just had a grudge against me for it, and tared my friend with the same brush. In any event, definitely a very weird and off putting experience!",

Anyway, on to my short tale!\n\nI had just finished my shift at the department store I worked at and was picking up a few things. I admit that I don't have the healthiest diet but I also didn't make much money and I had student loans to pay back. Therefore, some of the groceries I was buying was instant ramen.\n\nThe cashier who rang me out knew I worked there so she was more laid back when making small talk with me. When she went to scan the ramen she stopped and said, \"You know this is really bad for you! It's so full of salt!\"\n\nYes, it is. It's also ~$0.40 apiece. Besides, I try not to judge others but she wasn't exactly a healthy eater herself and was actually bigger than I am so I definitely didn't want to hear any lectures from her. Not that I wanted a lecture with my purchases anyway...\n\nSince I was tired from the day and annoyed by how rude she was I simply replied, \"Yes. I know.\"\n\nShe then *stopped ringing me up and stood there reading the package*. She read out the sodium content and remarked, \"Wow!\"\n\nStill trying to be polite, I just said, \"I need to go catch the bus.\"\n\nAfter that she kept ringing me up, I paid and left.\n\nNo, I didn't say anything to management about it because at the time I was shocked but felt it wasn't a big deal. Only later did I realize how rude she'd been but I still didn't feel like complaining to management because I didn't feel it was *that* big of a deal. Now when I go in the store I make sure to avoid her lane, though.",

        "text": "SO and I were at the local Hot Pot place, having just ordered our first round of food, when a middle aged couple was seated at the table across the isle from us. For those who have never had Hot Pot before, you are given a pot of flavourful broth, which boils on a hot plate set into the stove, and you order various vegetables, meat, etc, that you cook in the broth then eat. Easy concept, and the waiters will even ask if you've tried hot pot before when you arrive so they can explain it to you if needed.\n\nThe couple seemed baffled by every step. The waiter came over to them twice to explain the difference in their broths and pots (normal or spicy, big pot or small...not that complicated). Then once they had finally picked their pot, they must have stared at the menu for a good 15-20 minutes. Every option was listed, and accompanied by a picture. You check off what you want and how much on a sheet.\n\nThey even stared over at us as we ate, watching us dip our food into the broth with wide and confused eyes, pointing back and forth between the menu and our various plates of food. They were whispering away to each other in fluent English the whole time, so it couldn't have been a language barrier.\n\nFinally they seemed to have made their choice, but even after handing off their paper to one waiter, they waved down our waiter, who had just dropped off our second round, to ask more questions about how the hot plate worked (it had 3 buttons - On/Off, temperature Up, temperature Down).\n\nWhile waiting for their food, they began to stare at us and our food again. Some foods like fish tofu and squid tentacles look a little unusual, yes, but this couple seemed baffled by things as simple as cabbage and corn, and kept watching us place and remove our food from the pot with a look of utter confusion. \n\nFinally their first round arrives. My SO and I watch as they struggle to use chopsticks to place beef slices and lettuce leaves in the pot (they had been offered, and refused, a fork). They stare at their food once it's removed before eating it with their faces two inches off the plate. They slowly, with difficulty, put some watercress and some tofu in the pot. Once again, they eat with their faces two inches off the plate. There is a hurried, whispered conference between them before the husband picks up the ordering paper, and heads towards the payment counter.\n\nThe wife, still at the table, sits there staring at the still-boiling pot on it's hot plate for almost the entire fifteen minutes the man is at the payment counter, arguing with the waiters. Just staring at the pot and nothing else. When the man returns, assumably having argued his way out of paying for the very few items they even touched, they grab their their coats and leave. I had to stop myself from grabbing their sleeve as they went by and asking just what baffled them so much about the easy process of Hot Pot.",

I'm not obese by any means, but I have some extra \"curves.\" While I love walking, hiking, swimming, etc. I do have a pretty strong sweet tooth. (Maybe you can see where this is going?)\n\nSo I'm at the checkout line in the groccery store with all my items on the belt--eggs, bread, cereal, the works. That day I'd picked out some ice cream as well because I'm an adult and I can do what I want. Behind me is this lady I didn't really get a good look at because I didn't think it would matter. All I can remember is that she was older than me, skinny and wearing one of those yoga headbands or something. Unbeknownst to me, she decided to place her things super close to mine without the little plastic divider.\n\nThe cashier is scanning my items when he gets confused about where my items end and the other lady's begin, so he asks the very casual question of \"Oh, is this ice cream yours?\"\n\nI could have very easily just said \"yes\" and it would have all been over and done with. But for some reason, the woman behind me feels the need to give her input: \"Oh yeah, it's definitely hers. I'D never touch that stuff--I only eat healthy.\" (At this point I notice what she's placed on the belt--kale, apples, cabbage, all kinds of fresh produce.) The lady adds; \"I mean, obviously it's hers, because...\" At that point she pretty much looks me over and I know what she's thinking. \n\nThe cashier looks incredibly uncomfortable and gives a sort of awkward laugh and changes the subject. I'm the type of person who can never come up with a good comeback in the moment--of course I muttered to myself all the way home with a list of things I wish I could've said to her skinny ass. I bet she has a plaque that says \"Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels\" on her pristine white condo wall where she drinks green smoothies that taste like grass. You can live whatever lifestyle you want, but don't try to push it on other people. Imma be happy with my ice cream and cartoons, thank you very much. ",

I cannot resale partially eaten food. \n\nWoman: Well, my son didn't know he wouldn't like it. How was he supposed to know that?\n\nManager points to the sign in front of her that states \"Ask us for a sample!\" and just stares at the woman.\n\nWoman:.... Well, what am I supposed to do with this ice cream?\n\nManager: I don't know.\n\nWoman storms out, yelling at her son about how he never gets to try a new flavor of ice cream again. \n\nAnd then we found $20. The end.\n\nTl:Dr- neither did the woman at the ice cream store.\n\nEdited to add clarification: In response to \"control [my] fucking children\" I'm adding clarification that my children did not actually wipe boogers on the glass. In my tired state of mind when I composed this as 1 am after a long day of work, I failed to humorously convey what I was imagining. \n\nI was trying to describe how excited children get in places such as ice cream shops and will press their faces against the glass and stare in awe at the deliciousness presented. I do not allow my children to wipe their boogers on the glass over the ice cream.\n\nWe save booger wiping for the cookies at buffets.",

A place gets staffed by too many hipsters and you’ll never get a drink, if your boyfriend is bald. Because he reminds them of their dad. I think.)\n\nThey have polaroids of the ‘za under lucite at the register. I wanted a slice of pepperoni. I asked for it. The counter person silently placed an “out” sticky note over said flavor.\n\nThis could mean “we’re out now that your ordered the last one.” Or, “we’re we’re out already but neglected to say so until you made it clear.”\n\nThere’s a pause while I wait for information. “So that’s a no, on my pepperoni?” Silence. Maybe a nod. \n\nWhatever. I choose another slice. I take out my pizza punch card, mildly proud to have actually remembered it.\n\n“Oh. Did you get the update?”\n\nWhat. I have no idea what that means. My phone and computer try to update all the time. \n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“We’re changing to digital punch cards. We’ll still take yours. For a while.”\n\nOk. Later my bald boyfriend tells me he overheard from someone else at the counter, who removed the sticky note, that they did have pepperoni.\n\nHopefully this person was newer and will get more user friendly... but on the other hand courtesy seems to by dying along with everything else.",

It was crazy busy due to a fundraiser, but they were doing good at bringing and keeping food on the buffet.\n\nCue grumpy old lady. She is old enough to have a walker with a seat, and is taking her time sizing up the offerings. She wasn’t in our section but it’s a central area where we line up and get our pizza spaghetti and other good stuff. \n\nCue grumpy old lady freaking out, the guy bringing out the pizzas was in the line of fire. She started yelling “What happened to MY cheese pizza?” He stands there for a second-I’m behind her patiently waiting to get delicious pizza. He said “Well it’s no longer on the buffet but we are bringing more out”. That was not good enough for grumpy old lady. She continues “That was MY cheese pizza why did you let THEM have it?” He said “It’s a buffet everyone shares it. We are making more it will be out soon.” After a couple more minutes of staring daggers at him she finally relented and went back to her section”. He hurried to the back or else I would’ve said I’m sorry. \n\nSo goes the tale of the grumpy old lady at the super busy pizza buffet! ",

One evening, we’re heading down to the dining room and my dad gets stopped by the hostess (UL for undeserving lady)\n\nUL: “Sir I’m sorry but you can’t wear your tank top to dinner, you must have a sleeved shirt”\n\nI’m already embarrassed and turn back to the elevators to go with him to get a new shirt when-\n\nD: “What the f***!?! I see women in there with spaghetti strap dresses and you won’t let me in in THIS?!?”\n\nNow I’m absolutely mortified and I’m trying to get him to leave as he continues to yell and make a scene and the hostess calls over what I could only equate to a manager (PM, patient manager).\n\nPM: “What’s the problem sir?”\n\nFather angrily explains, becomes absolutely livid when PM backs UL. As he begins to scream more, after many times threatened to be kicked out, I slap him to shut him up and walk him back to the elevators. Go up to the room, make him change, bring him down, apologize to the hostess. \n\nNot once did the manager or hostess yell or get agitated with him and he was quite literally going insane. How do they do it? I’d have long decked him by then.\n\nTl;dr: Dad goes belligerent on cruise ship employees for something that was his fault and they remain calm and respectful the whole time.",

        "text": "A bit of back story to add context: my friend and I go to a local art house cinema on a pretty regular basis. During the holidays they were offering certificates for six films at a discounted price (just under fifty percent off the price of six tickets) that you could buy and they would punch out the card for each film. We each bought a card because we figured we go so often it was worth it. This was just before the new year and we hadn’t been since until tonight. \n\nBetween the time we bought the cards and tonight, my friend’s wallet was stolen off a train and the card was among the things in it. We get to the cinema and explain what happened to the woman in the lobby (who was the same woman who sold the cards to us) \n\nEssentially, she said that she didn’t know if the card had been used before and we didn’t have a receipt (though she did pay with her card and could show the statement). The tone was very “my hands are tied” but it was rushed as well because there were other people buying tickets – though she did say she recognised us and remembered selling us the tickets. I used my card for the both of us, we went to the film (I, TONYA which is really excellent, btw), and we resolved to follow up afterwards when it wasn't busy. \n\nAfter the film there was someone different in the lobby but she called the other person who was in her office to come down. We were ready to explain how we both bought cards, mine hadn’t been used – and since we always come together, it would be reasonable to assume her card hadn’t been used previously either. \n\nWe didn't even have to say anything - the woman came down with six passes and said that they didn’t have any more of the cards but these were essentially the equivalent just in a different form. They didn’t have to do that but it’s really nice they did! Replacing the contents of a wallet is an expensive process and it’s great that they were able to make it a bit less awful. I think it also highlights how great locally owned, community based companies are – it made our night a lot better and I’m really happy to continue to go there and send all my friends there as well. :) \n",
