If I stay in a slight (250-500ish) caloric deficit and still get around 200g of protein daily, will my potential growth be impacted?\n\nThank you!",

I normally eat 2 eggs a day. I avoid fish as much as possible and only eat it when i \"have to\". \n\nI tried to read in this sub about it and came with the conclusion that egg and meat are the way to go, and beans, peas.\n\nWhile nuts and soy also contains protein, they have their downsides, such as high calories per protein and soy should not be an everyday item to eat. \n\nOat meal also seem to have a lot of calories per protein.\n\nWhat is your take on this?\n\nAlso, are there a guide in this reddit, or a writeup?",

        "text": "I recently tried Roar Organic’s Cucumber Watermelon drink which I find tastes great, has a variety of vitamins/electrolytes and only contains 2 grams of sugar. I was doing some research and found that Roar went through an entire rebrand, and per an article in ADWEEK, “This Beverage Brand's Aesthetic Is, Proudly, 'Yoga Pants on a Bottle.’ Roar Organic changed its entire brand, from the formula to its social handle.”\n\nWhat I don’t understand is they claim a total of 2g of sugar (1 added) per bottle (18oz) but yet the second ingredient is organic coconut water from concentrate and the forth ingredient organic cane sugar. \n\n“INGREDIENTS:\nFILTERED WATER, ORGANIC COCONUT WATER FROM CONCENTRATE (WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE, ORGANIC COCONUT WATER CONCENTRATE), ORGANIC ERYTHRITOL, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, ORGANIC NATURAL FLAVORS, OR - GANIC FRUIT &amp; VEGETABLE JUICE FOR COLOR, SEA SALT, L-MALIC ACID, ASCOR-BIC ACID (VITAMIN C), POTASSIUM CI-TRATE, CITRIC ACID, ORGANIC STEVIA LEAF EXTRACT, D-CALCIUM PANTOTHEN - ATE (VITAMIN B-5), D-ALPHA-TOCOPHER-YL ACETATE (VITAMIN E). RETINYL PALMITATE (VITAMIN AJ. PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN B-6), CYANOCOBALA-MIN (VITAMIN B-12).”\n\nI wasn’t able to find specific sugar details for coconut concentrate however pure coconut water contains between 10-13 grams per serving (Ex: Trader Joe’s Single Origin Organic Coconut Water has 11g sugar) and organic cane sugar is 4g of sugar per 1 tsp. \n\nMy question is, if coconut water has sugar and they are adding sugar cane, how is it possible that a 18oz drink only has only 2 grams of total sugar with 1g added? Is it such that coconut concentrate has 0g of sugar and they are putting a very very small amount of sugar cane?\n\nBTW: I also find it strange that there is no photo of the nutrition label on their website \n\n[Roar Organics](https://roarorganic.com/#electrolytes-section)",
