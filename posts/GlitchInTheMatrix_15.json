Not wanting to be in my mom's way as she puts them away, I set the egg down on the counter and waited at the table. I just browsed on my phone until my mom finished. As soon as I get up and turn around, I see the egg is not there. Now, I specifically remember putting it there because I didn't want it to roll away and fall. I ask my mom where it went and she looks at me confused. She had also seen the egg but insisted she hadn't moved it, which started a family wide search in my kitchen, simply because this did not make sense. Both my mom and brother confirmed seeing the egg and no one else had come in. We looked everywhere, even though an egg falling off the counter would have been pretty noticeable. It sounds silly but seriously, what the fuck? Is this some kind of \"glitch\"? \n\nTL;DR: I set an egg on my kitchen counter, looked away for a few minutes, and it was gone.",

I stumbled upon this subreddit and thought maybe there was a person out there who could relate or give some insight on what my Mom and I saw.... I have not stopped thinking about it because there is no logical explanation...\n\nI was driving my Mom up to Seattle for a tattoo appointment, we are cruising along in the HOV lane chatting about her school courses. Four to six cars ahead of us I see a Honda/Toyota Crossover SUV with British Columbia plates swerve into the median/ditch area. It does a couple of zig-zags and I see a bicycle tire fly into the air, a plume of dirt/dust is kicked up, the car comes to a stop. It does not hit the concrete median. As this is happening I am telling my Mom to call 9-1-1. While she is on the phone telling them what happened I pull over to the side, the crossover is behind us, I am watching it in the rearview mirror seeing if anyone gets out. My Mom and I decided to go check on the people in the car, maybe they are in shock and need someone to keep them calm. We run over to the car, I am on the passenger side seeing that a bicycle that was attached to the front of the car is mangled under the passenger side wheel (I assume this may be the cause of the accident, it maybe became unlocked/unhitched and fell off and under the car, causing the accident). My Mom is on the driver side. The car is still on. I see the keys are in the ignition. The backseat and trunk are filled with boxes/belongings. We peer into the car and see NO ONE. The windshield and all other windows are intact. We look in the backseat/the boxes area (all from outside the car, we got freaked out when we didn’t see anyone in the car and were afraid to open the door). The windows were not tinted so we could see everything clearly and there was no possible spot for someone to be there and us not see them.  We checked under the car, around the car, over the median, the road.... no one else was there. We called 9-1-1 again to let them know we did not see anyone in the car but that it was on, and they told us it was okay to leave. So we did. \n\nOn the drive back (3/4 hours later), we pass the same spot hoping to see the car or maybe something there to explain what happened. The car was gone but the mangled bicycle remained. We are both pretty confused and just want some sort of logical explanation for what happened. I witnessed the whole thing and my eyes never left the vehicle...\n\nCould anyone out there perhaps give some insight on what I may have experienced? Has anyone else experienced the same? ",

I could see the sky where the middle of the cloud was and 3 of the 4 corners of the giant cloud was replaced by small puffy clouds.

During the dinner, I had to go to the bathroom. I was taking a dump when all of a sudden the door bursts open and the son walks in and closes the door. I can’t talk, I’m talking but nothings coming out. The family that moved in are a family of aliens.

        "text": "A while ago, I read a post about driving as far as you can in a place that you have never been before, to test the boundaries of \"the matrix\" or whatever. The theory being, that you would eventually meet some sort of block that would prevent you from going any further. Well, I tried it today and it freaked me out quite a bit. (This happened about one hour ago so its pretty damn fresh in my mind btw)\n\n\nI had about an hour and a half off of for lunch today and I had nothing to do. At first I was just driving around for no reason looking for something to do, but then I saw a road that I had never gone down before. That reminded me of the post I saw, so i figured screw it, Ill try it out. The road was southbound and almost never turned. I drove down the road for about 15 minutes when I came across a closed road. The road lead back to where I came from, so immediately I was concerned, since that was one of the only roads that lead back. The road didn't even seem to have a reason to be closed either, It looked like a perfectly functional road. Nevertheless, I kept on the same road, I wasn't in any hurry. After about 5 more minutes, I noticed that the road was a lot smaller than I had been before. It looked more like a bigger neighborhood road, not a highway. Not 500 feet later, a cul de sac. Very confusing. no highway ends in a cul de sac. so i turned around and tried to follow the same way out. Then i came to a T in the road. That really fucking confused me. I hadn't turned once off of that road. I turned around, pulled over, and brought out google maps. I was in the opposite direction that I had started from. North. More shockingly, I knew the road that I was on. I take it everyday to work. So i just followed it back. No problem. When i got back, I pulled out google maps again and tried to retrace my steps. The road goes south. Nowhere is there a curve that heads north. I have no clue what the hell happened.\n\n\n",

        "text": "During my childhood (as I'm sure will be a commonality for most suburban American kids), there were always Pop Tarts around. Even if you didn't want one, you could be sure that opening up your cupboard or a friend's would usually turn up at least one if not more boxes.\n\nAnyway, this story pertains to a situation where one Pop Tart seemingly defied the laws of physics. \n\nThis was back in about 2006-07 (I was about 12 at the time). One day, a few friends and myself were walking around a local beach (one eating a Pop Tart, of course – I can’t remember the specific one but it was berry flavored and I’m pretty sure they have since discontinued them), when the friend eating the Pop Tart suddenly goes, “I don’t want the rest of this, I think I’m gonna go plant it!” And walks away next to some foliage, digs a small hole, buries it, and we were off on our merry way.\n\nWe spent a lot of time at that beach, so sometime in the few weeks after that we were walking near the same spot and I decided to go look by where the Pop Tart was buried just for shits and gigs. When I got there I saw what, to this day, is just about the only thing I’ve personally experienced that I cannot think of a logical explanation for. Sitting there, in the exact spot where my friend buried the Pop Tart, was a friggin blue and purple sapling sprouting. Of course, I excitedly called all my friends over to witness what might be a major botanical breakthrough, and they confirmed that the thing I was seeing was not a hallucination. Then, my brother – being an 11 year old kid – decided it would be hilarious to pee on it. So he did. \n\nA day later, the sapling was brown and dead. We never tried planting another one. To this day, I cannot figure out exactly what the hell was going on there. Maybe there was a plant coming up in that exact spot and the Pop Tart food dye affected the pigmentation of the sapling? That’s the only thing resembling an explanation I can think of. I still talk to the group of guys that were there for it (5 others) from time to time and they are all still just as bewildered. I wish that we had been just a bit older so that someone would have had a phone and some photo evidence, but alas all I have is a bizarre memory of a blue and purple sapling. \n",

She was wearing the same outfit, was riding the same horse, and was doing the same race as she was when I crashed. And what was even weirder was like she was stuck in a loop?? She just kept going and going and going. She would disappear and then reappear doing the same thing. My mind was blown. I mean, logically thinking, I guess it could be a glitch with the game, but most of the glitches have been patched over and no one I know of knows any kind of glitch like that. There's no way she was lag cheating either because lag cheating doesn't make you get stuck in a loop. ",

I have always brushed my teeth using the kitchen sink because back then everyone in my family slept at the same time, all the bathrooms would’ve been occupied by my sisters, brothers and parents, so I figured I could use the kitchen sink instead. Now back to the story. \nI was sitting at the dining table, brushing my teeth and browsing the internet when I felt a presence. Instinctively, I looked around and felt a little eery because it was dark and the only source of brightness came from the dim orange light in the hall. That’s when I found my sister in a crouching position, staring at me at the end of the stairs. The entrance to the kitchen and the staircase are directly opposite each other, only separated by a hall. Just picture two horizontal parallel lines, the space in between is the hallway. \nI only saw her silhouette, which could be explained by the lack of light. After staring at her confusedly for a while, I flipped a finger and went back to my phone. She ran up the stairs afterwards but the strange thing was I didn’t hear her get into her bedroom. Every door in my house makes a loud sound when closing or opening. I finished brushing and went to her room on the first floor to see that she was asleep. How could she be in bed, when I didn’t even hear her open or close the door after running up the stairs? I tried to shake her awake but it seemed she had been sound asleep for a while as she woke up grumbling and annoyed.\nThe next morning, I told her about the incident and at first she just kept jokingly said “Gotcha!”, but then she denied and was as shocked as I was.\nThe next night, it was also 1AM when I came down to the kitchen to brush my teeth. And the same thing happened again, but this time I was quick on my feet. When I saw her crouching there, I immediately rushed towards the stairs only to see her running back up. I chased after her but on the third floor I couldn’t see her anymore. I remained there looking into my room, the storage room and went even as far as the balconies on the fifth floor but saw nothing. I came back down the stairs, utterly perplexed and made one last check in my sister’s bedroom. She was there, sound asleep. I heard no door being opened or closed the whole time. \nI told my family the next day and they all laughed it off, to my expectation. It doesn’t happen anymore as now I’m always turning on the lights. \n",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster so sorry for wrong format (also doing on mobile)\nSo after discussing this experience with my best friend and her saying that it's \"post Worthy\" I have decided to share. \nThis literally happened not even an hour ago.\n\nBack story: my brother recently moved and is living with me. He moved from across the country and he does not have a car at the time so me and my husband take turns getting him to and from work. \n\nIncident in question; my husband got out of work and he called me after getting out of work to ask if my brother had called saying he was ready to be picked up yet. I said no I never got anything mind you my brother had also said lastnight that he might get out early today ( he usually gets out a 5 and this was around 4:30) After getting off the phone I made a quick look at my text messages just to be sure ( which I've been doing since I got out at 2) and I see that I did have a text message from my brother saying \"hey sis I'm ready\" I made a note that it said 4:15 so I immediately call my husband and say\n\"Hey, I actually did just get a message so go ahead and pick him up.\"\nI had been checking my text messages quite often so the fact that it said 4:15 was weird but I thought maybe my phone had lagged or something. \nSo I called my brother and I apologize \n\" hey sorry I didn't get your text message earlier but my husband's on the way\" \nThere is a slight silence and then he says \"I had actually just pulled up your name and was about to text you  because I'm almost ready to be picked up...but I haven't text you yet?\"\nI it's kind of thrown off so I responded with \"yeah you text me at 4:15 saying we're ready right?\" \n\"No!\" \nSo we hang up the phone and I immediately called my best friend and I'm telling her how weirded out and I remember the text message she's like are you sure it's from today? so I go back to my text messages to verify the date and the message is just gone.\nI know what I saw.",

        "text": "This strange occurrence has happened  to me a couple times already. So I am a teenage kid who normally has a lot of throat issues from time to time accept of one night about a month or two ago I was lying in my bed on my phone when I noticed my body greeting weaker and my throat feeling like it was so tight that I could barley breathe. I honestly thought I was dying and struggled to get air. When I wake up I am under a thin blanket in some kind of hospital like room in a restrained bed. Looking around the windows were extremely dark and there was a constant beeping sound. It gave off an eerie vibe. A lot of it is pretty vague but I remember this greenish thick smoke pour into the room and a person in some kind of gas mask and medical outfit. No communication whatsoever they just walked over to me, took a needle sample, pulled out another needle that had some kind of mark on it and injected it into my wrist. Next thing I knew the green gas was back and I was left alone in the room and slowly went unconscious. I woke up back in my bed with a weird feeling in my body.\n\n Now last night I was lying in bed on my phone when my throat started to feel real constricted and I went unconscious. This time I woke up in a room significantly smaller than the first and I was on a mattress layed out on the floor. Again the green gas flooded the room and the same person with the gas mask walked in looking a bit rugged and in a rush. Of course I started yelling where am I and who are you and other words but they just hastily walked over and reapeted  the needle thing. The gas came back on and they rushed out of the room. I could feel someone/something else was in the room but I didn't dare turn around because it was making some really weird sounds. I woke up back in my bed with an odd \"what just happened\" feeling coursing through my body.\n\n I thought all of of this was just my imagination or something but it all felt so real I could even feel the needle and the pain and it was nothing like a dream should be. I honesty felt like a test subject it some kind of experiment or something. \n\nAnyone have any similar experiences or ideas on what happened? I have extensive experience with sleep related hallucinations because I am narcoleptic and this felt just as real as me typing this post. Nothing like the sleep related hallucinations I’m used to. It got me thinking things like what if the reality I live in is actually some type of virtual reality and my body is being kept in preservation by some technological advanced humans who are attempting some type of experiment or preserving what is left of humanity and I’m actually in a stimulation at the peak of the quality of life of humans when in reality some type apocalypse is occurring outside of the stimulation. The monster I did not look at seemed very aggressive and bloodthirsty so what if they are now the top of the food change and the dude with the gas mask was attempting for the last time to save humans before he and the rest go extinct. I probably sound like a lunatic but if you saw what I saw everything seemed more real than anything ever has before. I mean if this were true I’d just be this to a site filled with AI but let’s see what you guys think about this.   ",

Im crossing to the other side of the street and a lady with a leashless dog crosses aswell, but she was on the other side and coming towards where i was crossing from. We pass eachother. I look back for some reason, almost as if i got a strange feeling of the two. Anyway, i can clearly see that she continues to go the same direction. 2 minutes later, im almost home. I see my house, but before i walk in, i look to my left and the woman with the dog was suddenly standing there. She was just casually walking from the parking lot. She passed me and went inside her home. Turns out we are neighbours! Ive never seen her before! But how could she get here first? I was totally baffled because there was no other way but the way i went, so surely if she walked passed me i would have noticed? I was walking at quite a fast pace aswell because it was cold and snowy outside. Was this a glitch, or is there a simpler explanation?",

Its 11:30 when we leave, we text our friends and let them know that we'll be there in 15 minutes. \n About 12 minutes later we're at a red light before our exit. I check the time, 12:45. I point out to him the radio time is wrong, he checks his phone. 12:45. I shrug it off and proceed to our friends house, who isn't home. I call him and he tells me they waited over an hour for us and decided to go somewhere else without us. \n I have absolutely no idea what happened. The highway is a straight run, speed limit is 55 but I always set cruise at 57-58 mph. It took an hour and 15 mins to travel 11 miles somehow. ",

I went about the night, and for the rest of the week, whenever I used my laptop I distinctly remember touching the bare sticky residue where my lost white cap used to be.

All of a sudden, a white cap falls off and I think great a second one this week. But, when I turn my laptop over there are three on, and I am holding the fourth white cap. I know that cap was long gone in my apartment, as I had cleaned this week. I guess the only explanation is that I just woke up in an alternate timeline. ",

        "text": "Okay so this is a story my Stepmom has told me about the experience she had with my dad who has since passed, god rest his soul. She has no idea how to explain anything that happened but our family likes to theorize.\n\nThe two of them are out celebrating my stepmoms birthday. My dad being a loving husband got my stepmom tickets to a concert she really wanted to go to. This was a big deal because the closest major metro was about 2 hours away from where they were living at the time. The plan was for them to drive into town, see the show and then drive back home the same night. My dad was a road trip expert, it was kind of his thing. I’ve personally witnessed him drive 16 hours in the same position along winding coastal highway on nothing but Pepsi, lay’s potato chips and 7/11 coffee. Plus the route is a super simple 2 hours of highway: one hour driving east, take a left and one hour of driving north (this will be important later). \n\nMoving on, they really enjoy the concert and are ready to head home, it’s about 11pm and very dark. They are on the highway for about 15 minutes and are just barely making it out of the metro when they get pulled over. My dad (who liked to pride himself on his ability to talk his way out of a ticket, but was really just a kiss ass) slows down, pulls off the highway and into a parking lot. He then asks my stepmom to hand him his information from the glovebox. As she’s fumbling with the books and he’s watching her neither of them are paying attention outside the car. When they both look up they realize that there are now dozens of police cars in the parking lot all with their lights and sirens on. The Sheriffs office, State Patrol and local patrol cars from all different agencies across the metro area. Both of them are terrified because being from a small town they have never seen so many police before, let alone pulling THEM over. In the middle of their panic (as my stepmom puts it) “almost as soon as they showed up, they all just vanished... and then we were the only ones in the middle of the parking lot.”....\n\nBoth of them are freaked out but there is more. They continue their journey home talking about what in the hell just happened to them. They finish the first hour stretch of highway and as they get closer to the exit where the head back west my stepmom notices that there is nobody on the highway. My dad begins taking the exit off the highway when instantly my dad, stepmom and their car find themselves in a field near the highway a couple miles before the exit ramp they had just took. Both of them vividly remember taking the exit and are extremely confused and just want to get home. My stepmom tries to call the police but there’s no reception. They return to the freeway, take the exit and are returned to the same place in the same field a couple miles from the exit. They take the exit one more time but there is no glitch this time and they turn onto the last hour stretch of highway. \n\nThis is when things get freaky. At this intersection of highway there is a gas station. My dad pulls off to get gas. As they pull into the parking lot they notice that all 4 or 5 of the cars are white but there is nobody pumping gas into any of them. My stepmom gets out of the car to go pay for gas when my dad grabs her arm and tells her she should stay in the car. He tells her (as stepmom tells it) “I have this feeling that you are calling out for me from really far away but I can’t reach you” and the both of them agree to go to a different gas station. They make the rest of their trip home without anything odd happening and people on the highways again. Once they get home they sleep it off and life is normal. A day or two later when my stepmom was reading the news paper she finds are article stating that the gas station my dad stoped her from going into was robbed that same night (her birthday). A guy killed the attendant and took a girl hostage who was in the store. He took her into the field behind the gas station to a tree where he killed her and then himself. \n\nMy stepmom thinks my dad and her were supposed to be the ones in the gas station but at the last second fate changed its mind. My dad didn’t like to talk about it.\n\n",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have a book that I think a lot of you would find very interesting and that might explain some of the Dimensional Glitches that occur within our world. \n\nThis book is intriguing as it talks about many similar things to what people in mystical states mention such as seeing into parallel dimensions and interacting with beings from other worlds etc.\n\nThis book is called Zhuan Falun and it is from the Buddha Law School of Cultivation however it is not Buddhism the religion or Daoism the religion, it's something more profound. It seems to me to be more of a spiritual science as many of the terms and concepts in the book are talked about in a scientific down to earth manner instead of flowery mystical prose which I found very refreshing.\n\nNow here is where it gets interesting, this book talks about the following things:\n\n● Other Dimensions - Levels Of Dimensions spanning into the microcosm and also outwards into the macrocosm\n\n● The Soul - It talks about people having a Master soul and a subordinate soul which is hidden from you but is at a more advanced level then you, it states some people have more then one Subordinate soul and some are of not of the same sex as you i.e males having a female subordinate soul etc.\n\n● Microcosmic worlds - This concept was very far out but it talks about there being worlds within you, countless worlds. Similar to our world with life , water, animals etc. An analogy is zooming an an atom within one of your cells and realizing at that level of magnification it is just like our solar system. Then zooming into a single particle in that world and finding out it too is a vast world, apparently the level it can go onwards like this is beyond imagination.\n\n● Supernatural Abilities - In the book they mention that everyone has them it is just that they have atrophied. It goes into depth about this topic. Some abilities that are mentioned are precognition, retrocognition and remote vision.\n\n● The 3rd Eye - Talks about how at the front part of our pineal gland there is a complete structure of an eye there. Modern science calls it a vestigial eye but in the cultivation world they say this eye just naturally exists like that and it can be activated allowing one to pierce through this dimension and see other dimensions. It talks about how there are many levels to this 3rd eye and it goes into great depth about it.\n\n● Thoughts - This part was amazing. It talks about how a human brain is just a processing plant. How the real you is actually your soul, it's like your whole body and brain is just a vehicle and that the true commands are issued by your master soul, but this master soul is very tiny and it can switch positions while inside you and it can also expand and shrink. It can move from your brain to your heart and to other parts of your body and it is 'he' who calls the shots. Your brain is just the factory which your master soul sends his cosmic commands to which then create the forms of expression and communication we use such as speech, gestures, etc.\n\nThese are just a few things that are covered but there are many many other things which blew my mind when I read it because of how it resonated with some of the mystical experiences people sometimes have, especially the multidimensional nature of reality and how all of them are hidden in our day to day perceptions of the world.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to anyone you can grab a copy of the book here:\n\nhttp://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf",

To save you all reading time, in essence, I met up with one of my best friends from high school that I had faded away from during college. Our hangout didn’t go as expected, so my dream-logic prompted me to write him a vicious letter and send it to him in the mail. Apparently, this letter sent my old friend over the edge who stormed out of the house to come kick my ass, but he ended up getting in a serious car wreck and sent into a coma. \n\nAlmost a week later, I had a dream that said friend had passed away. While standing in the hallway of my old high school, I saw his mom crying alone. I offered her my sympathy, but was met with pure vitriol and anger. “How could you write that letter to my son?” and, “You’re the  reason my son is dead,” were two of the remarks I remembered to write down. \n\nI’m no stranger to recurring dreams; I had one from a young age until I moved out of my house for college. This was something very different. I’m not saying this is prophecy or some kind of deja vu moment setting me up for future troubles. \n\nIn fact, I don’t know what to call it. What do you all think?

I live in a college town, and considering traffic can be bumper-to-bumper at random times, I decided to leave earlier than usual. \n\nAfter realizing that traffic wasn't going to be crappy, I took a detour through campus – mostly for nostalgia purposes. As usual I was jamming out to my music, drumming on my steering wheel, when I had to stop at a stoplight. I didn't catch it until a few seconds after I rolled to a stop, but every visible light was in sync with the beat of my music. At first I thought my eyes might be vibrating to my drumming, so I stopped – yet the lights continued. It wasn't just the set-of-three in front of me either, the other sets were also doing it. \n\nI don't know about you, but I've never seen six separate lights short out – especially not in perfect sync with music. Unfortunately, those were the only lights that I was stopped at so I couldn't test any other theories out. \n\nLooks like I'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to see again. \n\n\nUpdate: \n\nI didn’t notice any stoplights acting up on my way home, but the entire day after noticing the glitch I’ve heard a subtle ‘whirring’. The best way I can describe it is a laptop fan. Very, very strange, considering it’s been most noticeable nowhere near technology/buildings that would put off the same sound. \n\nI’ll keep you all updated with further information. ",

My friend didn’t, but i talked to my brother, who’s an electrician i should mention (so i feel sort of okay with him doing it), to check and and make sure there’s no unsafe measures of Carbon Monoxide in my home. \nI never thought that that’d even be the problem, but i wanted to make sure just in case. \n\nHe did the whole process, and said everything looked normal, so i’m ruling that as not the problem. \n\nNow, ever sense my last post, a few weird shit has happened. \n\nMy friend was standing outside yesterday morning, waiting for the bus to come. A car pulled into the neighborhood. She immediately noticed that the tires were almost flat. She thought it was crazy how he was even able to drive. The car slowed down in front of her driveway. Right in front of her. He just idled there for like three seconds then sped off. \n\nMy friends doesn’t know who he was or really what he looked like because it spooked her. \n\nLast night i got a phone call. Me and my friend have been getting No Caller ID Phone calls daily at this point. Every time we answer it’s just silent. But this phone call was different. It didn’t have a No Caller ID, or a number, it was just blank. I tried to screenshot it, but it when i did i clicked decline on accident. That could just be an error or something, but it freaked me out. \n\nThat’s really all that’s weird that’s happened worth noting. We’ve been trying to involve ourselves more at school to avoid the paranoia this is causing us. ",

It took place in the house I was living in at the time, and it was almost so clear that I could have sworn it happened. I was sitting on my porch with a friend when suddenly this unknown being, I'm going to call it an Alien, but had a trench coat of some sort on started making its way towards us. My friend booked it off the porch and its like the alien didn't notice him and proceeded towards me. So I ran in my house, the tv was on, cartoon network to be exact because I remember seeing the logo on the tv. The alien walked in behind me &amp; at this point I was so scared, screaming at that, then ran behind a couch and was like this has to be a dream. So I started banging my head on the back of the couch and telling myself to wake up until I did and when I did, I took a big gasp of air like I wasn't breathing the whole time. \n\nStill til this day, I'm 26 now, I think about it and could never come up with a reason on how I knew to wake myself up to get out of the nightmare.

One of my favorite shows.  It was some kind of tv special though, so it was highly anticipated. not just your regular “new” episode of a show. \nSo i started watching the damn show with my mom or sister or somebody nearby but i was surprised because it wasn’t a new episode? Well it was the new special but i honestly knew everything that was going to happen as it happened. I even called it out, but my mom or sister didnt seem to care since I was you g or whatever.  I always thought about this over the years, like how is it that i had seen that episode already? Maybe about a week before? But it was supposed to be premiering that day? I didnt even wanna watch because i was legit pissed it wasnt a new episode. ",

        "text": "Sitting here watching videos on YouTube about how redditors love a mystery. This got me thinking of an experience that happened to me as a child .\n\nSo for a bit of context, I’m 18 years old now, and I must have been 8 to 10 years old when this happened, so 2008 to 2010 ish. I had this old PC with windows 7 on it where I would play a few games I had. Particularly the original star wars battlefront. Now very important note, this computer and no capability to have internet on it. It had no WiFi capabilities and I don’t even think we where paying for internet at the time in our entire house. This obviously was done on purpose by my father. Also, this computer was very bare, we had wiped it completely of anything my father previously had on there and All we had on there where a couple of star wars games, in fact I could even name every program we had on there. And this is where the story begins.\n\n So one day I’m home alone with a friend and my little brother and we are sitting in my room playing this star wars battlefront game where my friend and I would take turns playing.  (I remember this so vividly I even can recall the map and character I was playing as) . When it came to my turn I put on the headphones we where using and started playing, and all of the sudden I hear a real human voice come from these headphones. It was defiantly NOT from the game. As far as I’m aware this game has 0 voice acting to begin with, and what the voice said and sounded like could not have come from this game. I still remember it was a adult male and it almost sounded like he was speaking from inside a cave with dripping water in the background. I distinctly remember it sounding like a cry for help, it said over and over “hello! Is anybody out there?” And other things to that effect.  I was completely perplexed and handed my headphones over to my friend to confirm I wasn’t going insane, and no shit he heard the same thing. To this day he can verify it happend to us and in fact so can my little brother. All three of us just took turns listing until eventually it just cut, and the noise from our video game resumed. This must have gone on for maybe a minute.  Now remember, I’m no expert, I don’t know a whole lot about computers and how the internet works, but I am 100 percent positive we had no internet accessible on this. So, any theories on what this might have been?\n\n",

        "text": "[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/7w0uhn/update_things_have_been_really_weird_lately_i/?st=JDDRNEPZ&amp;sh=52050dc0) \n\nSo before you start reading this, i’m aware that this could all just be looking too much into details or pure coincidences, but hear me out, i’m lost. These are all 100% true, and i could use any reasoning or explanation for why this stuff is happening. Thanks. \n\nSo, a few days ago me and my best friend were texting late at night, you know normal teen girl bullshit. I’d say it was around 11:10, and again, just normal texting. Well, we were talking for about another minute or so, and i shit you not the clock said 11:35. So obviously, i’m like hey, did time just speed by or am i going crazy? My friend told me i was right, because she went to the bathroom at like 11:09 and when i said it was 11:35 she just got out. No way she was in the bathroom for 20 minutes just taking a piss?? \n\nNow, that may just be because it was late and we zoned out or maybe just got caught up in a conversation, but ever sense that night, weird shit has been happening. \n\nAt first it was little things, us both getting pains in our bodies in the exact same places at the same time. \n\nEvery time we let our dogs inside they’d run into a safe place and act scared. \nBut it got worse. \n\nLast friday, i got home from school. My parents are divorced and my dad always picks me on some fridays. He’s usually there right at 4 for me. Sometimes even earlier. Today was different. I wasn’t mad at first because i had to finish my chores and get changed, but once it got around 4:30 i was kinda worried because my dad was never this late. I was gonna give him a call but i decided it was probably traffic because when school got out, we tended to clog up the roads. Then finally about 4:45 my dad texted me that he was pulling into my driveway and to gather my things and go outside. So, i grabbed my stuff and he wasn’t here. He didn’t show up for four more minutes. Then, eventually when he did i asked what took so long... \n \nHe told me that he texted me when he was like two streets away so i had time, but when he turned down one of the roads there was a guy standing in the middle of the road. He didn’t give too much detail, besides the fact that he was just standing there; looked like he’s never seen a car in his life. My dad called him a dumbass of course, and said he had to honk a few times, and he just walked away. \n \nHe just walked away. What? \nMy dad said he didn’t look homeless, if anything just like a normal guy. But that makes my gut hurt thinking about it. It makes no sense. \n\nWell, it doesn’t end there. I’d say that’s the creepiest thing, but there’s still more to what’s going on. This weekend me and my friend had a nightmare on the same night. Hers was more of a nightmare, as mine was just.. a noise. I don’t exactly remember what hers was about, and i’d go through the texts but we send about a thousand a day so i’d rather not. But mine was just plain weird. I heard a very loud, siren type noise. it was just like, fucking blasting. I’d say it lasted about ten seconds, then when i shot up from my bed it was just complete silence. It was around 4 am but i just went back to sleep. Still.. i’ve never had something like that happen. \n\nToday, things have been just as weird. My friends dog has been acting really nutty. Barking at shit outside when nothing’s there, and just acting off. My sister even told me that saturday morning our neighbors dog barked for two hour straight directly at our house... like what. \n\n\nNot to mention the text my friend received. We were texting like usual when she just said “. i got a text.” so of course i’m like ???? She sends me a photo of her apple watch notification that has my name on it and says “be there or be square”  i’ve never texted her that, and it doesn’t show up in our chat history at all. It was just a random text and we’ve honestly been on edge ever sense. \n\nNone of this makes sense to me. They’re all just little things that could be normal, but i’ve been getting a constant feeling of being watched. I can post updates as things happen, if any one is interested. I know this is sloppy, but it’s what’s happening. \n",

        "text": "Posted this on r/weird, but it definitely qualifies as a GlitchInTheMatrix\n\n\nOk, so I go to boarding school. And what I am about to tell you happened. So, a couple of my friends and I were planning to stay up all Saturday night and watch movies. So everything is fine. We are all drinking and eating and generally enjoying ourselves. However, at 2:00 AM some fucking crazy ass motherfucking shit happened. Like I can not ever explain this shit without breaking out in laughter, but this shit I am about to divulge actually occurred. So, the roommate of the friends whose room we were in (Lets call this aforementioned roommate, Person X), starts acting super weirdly all of a sudden. Like, before 2:00 AM he was fine, but then like outta nowhere his entire demeanor changed unprompted. He slammed his computer (I mean like SLAMMED) shut and started pounding the desk as if his fist was a hammer. He then proceeded to pound and kick the wall. HE did this with such force it started to shake. Person X than got up from his chair, and paced around the room for a little bit at which point he said (Albeit Slurred) that he was hallucinating (He also had a red swollen lump under his eye, if that makes a difference. Earlier in the day, the lump was smaller and progressively got bigger as the day went on. He said it was stinging as well.). After Person X paces around for a little while longer, he exits the room. He enters again, and sits down at his desk, resting his head on the desk. Soon, again, he paces around the room, proclaims once again that he is hallucinating, proceeds to assault the wall again, exits to an undisclosed location, returns. \n\n\n\n\nWe started to get concerned as his pupils where dilated and he was looking quite disheveled. His walking was more comparable with stumbling than with a normal, fluid walk. Then finally, we follow him to the bathroom to see what the hell is wrong with him. Person X stares at himself in the mirror, and mumbles some random unintelligible shit. Then, he goes into stall, a takes a nasty ass shit (Like it smelled worse than a New York City dumpster. You could hear interpolated farts as he was shitting, it was nasty). After 2 minutes of pure shitting (Yes he shat for 2 minutes), he pulled his pants up (There is no way one can shit like that and wipe in under 2 minutes. It is just not possible). Then, Person X goes to the sink. Only problem, HE DOES NOT EVERN USE SOAP!!!!!!!!! He just rinses his hands in cold water. As I then asked, why he used no soap, he just slowly turns his head in my direction super slowly (Like something you would see in the Shining), and mumbles some more unintelligible shit. However, I understood three words \"Hell, Anarchy, and Angel.\". He then flicks his hand in my direction, with all that nasty water.\n\n\n\n\n\n I exit the bathroom and make my way to the vending machine, but Person X sure enough follows me. He then stares at me from a good 15 minutes, after which he approaches me slowly. Then, with this murderous look in his eyes, he runs at me full speed (Luckily I sprint as fast as a motherfucker. My 100 meter dash time is 10.47 seconds.). I am, obviously, concerned and I make my way to campus security to report all the fuckery that just occurred. They sit him down, and ask my friend and I questions about the night. He didnt have any of our snacks and drinks. Also, when we were asked if Person X took any drugs or drank any alcohol, we said no (At lest Not that I know of. He is kinda secretive, so who knows what the hell this kid did.). Security chats with him a while longer, and they send him to his room. I go to talk to my friend about this, when I see that Person X is just fine (He still smelled though lmao). When I asked him what he remembered, he said he did not remember anything. I have no idea what happened, and the entire situation is just kinda freaking me out. Well, that was my Saturday night. I hope y'all get some laughs from this. tl;dr: Well this shit is so WTF, there is no way I can tl;dr this.\n\nUpdate:I am being threatened with legal action if I did not delete this post hahaha\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "There are a couple of instances that I can really remember this happening, but I have heard certain songs that upon first listen I am convinced I have not only already heard but have written! I get a really weird feeling over me on the very rare occasions that this happens. It is rarer now than it used to be.\n\nI can remember exact locations that I was standing when I had heard these songs and I remember the absolutely bizarre feeling that had occurred when it happened. The first instance I can still remember was while walking into a Meijer grocery store with my mom when I was probably about 10. The song was playing in the parking lot, and I specifically remember tugging on my mom's arm and telling her \"I feel like I wrote this song\". It has happened maybe every year or two since. \n\nThe first instance could maybe be written off, as I don't know how long the song had been out prior to my hearing it that day, and because of that maybe I had heard it in the past without realizing it.\n\nBut the issue came when I started keeping a dream journal. I am a songwriter and I decided to try and journal before bed and in the morning, hoping I could write some interesting songs about my dreams. One morning probably about 4 years ago when I was in high school I woke up and wrote down a line or two of lyrics that I absolutely know were part of a Katy Perry song, but the song didn't get released until just a year or two ago. I remember hearing the song for the first time a year or two ago, and I stopped dead in my tracks. I remember thinking that the people I was standing around with would NEVER understand, but I wanted to stop and say \"You guys... I think... I wrote this song.\" But it wasn't just the two lines of lyrics that matched up. By hearing her sing the two lines, I felt as though I had already heard the entire song even though it had JUST gotten released. I just had an all-encompassing feeling that I KNEW (as in, deeply understood and embraced a strange connection with) the song. I could hear the whole song in my head, I could anticipate how full the next part of the song would sound. The melody would occur and it just felt so RIGHT. Like I had known and loved that song and melody for a long time. But I had barely heard the song once on the day of its release, in fact I think I heard around 40 seconds of it.\n\nI don't discuss this feeling with almost anyone. My mom and my boyfriend know, and that's about it. I am not a huge believer in anything supernatural, or any kind of forces or anything specifically. I used to be such a skeptic about the world inter-connecting and global consciousness and all of that, but this weird occurrence that keeps happening in my life makes me wonder. It feels like it HAS to be more than Deja Vu. But I realize also that Deja Vu is almost the only likely explanation. \n\nI thought my boyfriend would laugh and write me off when I told him about this, but he has seen me talk so intensely passionately about this strange scenario that keeps happening to me, that he also has started to believe that there might be a little something more. Neither of us have any idea what it could be other than Deja Vu, though. It's not a huge deal, just a strange occurrence that happens every now and then, and when it does it feels like a shockwave of familiarity from a brand new source. \n\nIf anyone has a similar experience especially regarding Deja Vu or a glitch with music, I'd love to hear about it!\n\n\n\n\n",

I can think of maybe three days of my life where I very palpably got that sense, in one case acid was involved, and highly unusual things happened which included people going missing permanently. I don't really feel very comfortable talking about that in most spaces because it sounds either very crazy or very desperate for attention and so most of my life I just operate as if these things never occurred or I'm only receptive to conventional explanations for them, but inside part of my brain has always wanted more.
