I've been doing stand up for almost 2 years and have been writing jokes for 6. I got into comedy because I was drunk and thought that signing up for a stand up competition would be funny. My fear of confrontation got me to show up to the audition, then I got into the show. It spiraled out of control from there. \n\nThis summer, I wasn't able to get a job, so I went to New York City to do the stand up circuit and street perform. It was simultaneously the most dehumanizing and rewarding thing I have ever done. Despite all of the awkward silences and middle aged women calling security on me, my ego remained a solid 2 points above where it should be.\n\nI also have a book coming out in December called \"ha,\" which is all about the laws behind what makes things funny. I interviewed about 40 people in the comedy industry for it and read a bunch of psychology journals and put in a book for the general public and I expect everyone to read it.\n\nMy website is: [https://www.comedyjack.com](https://www.comedyjack.com)\n\nMy comedy reel is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npS8TlM03uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npS8TlM03uw)\n\nI am completely open to any sort of constructive criticism. It will make me feel bad, but I will get over it and use it to get better! Thank you guys so much!\n\nLove,\n\nJack \n\n\nPROOF IN BIO: https://www.instagram.com/comedianjack/",

I’m an anti-corruption activist and law professor whose book, *Corruption In America*, was cited in the dissent opinion in the Supreme Court case *Citizens United.*\n\nAs Attorney General, I’ll clean house on Albany corruption, lead the legal resistance against Trump’s assault on the law, battle financial fraud, and spearhead the moral argument against mass incarceration. **AMA!**\n\nCorruption is at the root of so many problems we face: underfunded schools, overpriced rents, high debt, income inequality, unaffordable health care, abuse of workers, environmental devastation. I’ve been an independent voice calling out the corruption in Albany, speaking and writing about the trials of Sheldon Silver, Joseph Percoco, and Dean Skelos.\n\nAnd Trump’s Presidency poses an existential threat to our democracy. We’ve got to fight it with every legal tool we have, including going after his business empire. Three days after Donald Trump took office, I was on the team of lawyers that filed Citizens for Responsibility in Ethics in Washington v. Trump (CREW) against Trump because of his violations of the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.\n\nWe’re running a truly grassroots effort, and to win, we need to turn out our supporters across the state. We’re running our campaign on volunteer energy and small-dollar donations -- we’re taking **no** corporate PAC or LLC money. You can [contribute to the campaign by clicking here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/zephyr-launch?refcode=reddit), and [sign up to volunteer here.](https://zephyrforny.com/volunteer/)\n\n**Leave your questions here, and I’ll be back at 1:30 PM Eastern to start answering them. See you then!**\n\nEDIT: THANK you all!!! I have to run--thanks for the great questions and ideas and I'm sorry I couldn't answer them all!! ",

Understanding the nuances between the American and Chinese cultures, I am now focused on my producer/writer/director career in Los Angeles. \n \nMy current projects include creating and starring in the upcoming series STEAMY KITCHEN, a new lifestyle cooking show which explores the experience of cooking as it intertwines with a woman’s career and creativity. The series is set to air in China later this year. Other projects I’ve worked on include THE AMAZING RACE: CHINA RUSH Season 2 which I was a producer and chief editor. I produced, wrote and directed THE LANE - A Dramedy TV show about five expats living together in an old lane house in the middle of the local townspeople. The show was the first of its kind in China and I am currently working on a US version of the show. I also wrote, produced and directed the short film BUTTERFLY REFLECTION which was showcased at Clermont-Ferrand Internat\n\nPROOF: https://imgur.com/a/bmuRGCy ",

        "text": "Hello Reddit!I’m Jukka Laakso, the Chief Eating Officer (or to be formal, CEO) of a Finnish based indie game dev for PC Rival Games.\n\nSix years ago, as I sat in the local Uni on a lecture about entrepreneurship, I decided I’ll never go down that route. Now, I’ve been running a company for over five years, shipped our own IP The Detail on Steam and iOS, and we’re just about to ship the season finale for an IP based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, Thief of Thieves on Steam. The last six years have been harsh sometimes, but also rewarding enough so that I wouldn’t change a single day.\n\nPowerPoints, finding funding for a game, learning from mistakes, hiring and firing people, underestimating scope and budget, keeping people motivated when there is hardly enough money to pay the rent, finding balance between work and life, and handling the stress of being responsible of the team and their well-being are the stuff I’ve been struggling with for the past couple of years.\n\nYou can check out the cool launch trailer here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn5B8PW3rnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn5B8PW3rnU)\n\nOr visit the Steam page here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/635390/Thief\\_of\\_Thieves\\_Season\\_One/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/635390/Thief_of_Thieves_Season_One/)\n\nAt Rival, I started doing a little bit of everything, but as the team grew, I gave others as much responsibility as possible. One of the first things I learned, never hire someone that isn’t more skilled on at least one of needed game dev skills (art, programming, etc.) than I am. Now as we are 17 strong, so the thing I mostly focus on is biz dev and finding new IP partnerships. Also, I’ve gotten married, had a daughter and even got a mortgage since the days at the Uni.\n\nI do know a thing or two about most of the different parts of game development. Except I suck at coding, even though I handle math and logic pretty well… Plus there are still a bunch of my fellow team mates here at the office, so I can have one of them pitch in with any of the more detailed questions regarding hands-on development, if needed.\n\nProof:  [https://twitter.com/tZZZuKKa/status/1023893380198264832](https://twitter.com/tZZZuKKa/status/1023893380198264832)\n\nJust ask me anything on making Games, working with big IPs, long days on PowerPoints, etc.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the questions. Due to time zones, I'll head to sleep. If there are still questions out there, feel free to post them and I'll take a last look on this in the morning.",

It takes place in a world where people have figured out a way to persuade everyday objects to disobey reality using naturally occurring runes or \"sigils\" - an art known as \"scriving.\" Write the sigil for \"stone\" on a piece of wood, and the wood will take on some properties of stone.  \n\nBut the city of Tevanne has figured out a new method of scriving, allowing them to drastically change reality, and invent powerful tools, devastating weapons, and build a brutal trade empire. Now Tevanne's four feuding merchant houses quietly vie to undercut one another, steal one another's trade secrets, and capture territory abroad.\n\nInto this world steps Sancia Grado, an escaped slave and unusually talented thief. Sancia doesn't know much about scriving, and she doesn't care to. She only cares about the job in front of her: robbing a very specific safe at a very specific warehouse at the waterfront. But unbeknownst to her, the safe holds a powerful artifact - a relic from an ancient civilization that was able to do much more amazing things with scriving. Now some very powerful people in Tevanne want her dead - and she'll have to unwind the secrets of the city's elites and make some unusual new allies to survive.\n\nThink of the Venetian empire of the early Renaissance, add in a magic system that functions a little like SQL, add a dash of the Thief games from the 90s, and you're about 70% of the way there.\nI am not the author of A Sexual Experience, but I did make a book trailer for it, and people seem to like it.\n\nAMA away!\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/crownpublishing/status/1023393652981354497\n\n#[Click here to go to the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/934tye/hi_reddit_im_fantasy_author_robert_jackson/)",

        "text": "Hi Reddit!  My name is David McNeill, and I have lived in the United States, China, Japan, and most recently, Germany. When I moved from San Francisco to Tokyo and then to Berlin, I saw firsthand how unhelpful information on the Internet is when it comes to finding a job and settling in a new country. There are surface-level articles discussing working abroad scattered across the web, but there is no single resource for people to turn to for genuine, actionable tips and advice before, during and after moving to a city halfway across the world.\n\nThis is where my new website [Expat Empire](https://expatempire.com) comes in. Expat Empire is singularly focused on providing the best quality content for new, experienced and soon-to-be expats around the world to make living and working abroad easier for everyone.\n\nExpat Empire's first product is an eBook entitled [Passport to Working in Japan](https://link.expatempire.com/japanAMA) that I have spent the last year researching, writing, and editing. The book focuses on my experience finding a job in Japan, moving to Tokyo, learning Japanese, adjusting to the Japanese work environment, and much more. It also includes advice from current expats and dozens of links to helpful resources to give readers the best chance to succeed in Japan.\n\nThe Expat Empire website and *Passport to Working in Japan* book are both launching today. **Passport to Working in Japan is 25% OFF for the next week only**, so don’t wait to pick up your copy! You can also subscribe to the Expat Empire newsletter to receive the first chapter for FREE!\n\nHere is some proof: r/[https://twitter.com/ExpatEmpire/status/1022415515862622210](https://twitter.com/ExpatEmpire/status/1022415515862622210). Ask me anything!\n\n===\n\n**Update:** Thank you so much to everyone who wrote in and asked a question!  I will be logging off for now but feel free to post here or message me and I will do my best to respond.

Feel free to shoot me an email through my website or ask on Twitter (@AlexGrace1008), and you can check out more of what I'm doing this field season on my [blog](https://alexandramcinturf.squarespace.com/new-index). For now, though, I have to head out to prep for my fieldwork this weekend. Thanks again! \n\nHey! My name is Alexandra (Alex) McInturf, and I’m a shark biologist, movement ecologist, and science communicator. As a PhD candidate affiliated with the University of California – Davis, Queen’s University, Belfast, and the Irish Basking Shark Study Group, I conduct my research primarily in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Here, I study the fine-scale movement patterns of basking sharks and the other elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) that inhabit this region (yes – there are sharks in Ireland!). I’m really interested in what movement can tell us about their behavior, and I use acoustic transmitters and biologgers to look at foraging, habitat choice, and social interaction. My work has recently been sponsored by National Geographic, and you can read more about it on my website. Some fun facts about me: I have degrees in both biology and English, I’m originally from the landlocked state of Ohio, and I’m part of a primate (not a shark) lab at UCD. AMA!\n\n* My website: [https://alexandramcinturf.squarespace.com/](https://alexandramcinturf.squarespace.com/)\n* For more information on the basking sharks in Ireland: [http://www.baskingshark.ie/](http://www.baskingshark.ie/)\n* To learn more about my field site (it’s at the top of the “Cool List” for 2017!): [http://www.natgeotraveller.co.uk/smart-travel/features/cool-list-17-2017/](http://www.natgeotraveller.co.uk/smart-travel/features/cool-list-17-2017/)\n\nJoin Nat Geo WILD for the final night of SharkFest, tonight at 8/7c!\n\nProof: [https://i.redd.it/1b56erl4y5c11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/1b56erl4y5c11.jpg) [https://twitter.com/NatGeo/status/1022618078289510400](https://twitter.com/NatGeo/status/1022618078289510400)",
