The issue is, I am not very good at it. I got through all of my classes with at least a 2.0, but it is not my passion and I do not see why someone would hire me over somebody who is genuinely interested in the subject. That said, I am graduating in the Spring and my degree is in computer science, so that is where I probably need to get a job. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of jobs in the comp sci field that someone with moderate knowledge and good people skills could do. I am willing to put in work but I think if I am at a job where the only thing I do is code all day I would not be good at it or very happy. I am thinking maybe project management or some sort of UX researcher but it has been difficult to find entry level jobs in these areas. Thank you in advance for any help!!",

        "text": "HI,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a question to ask but before that I want to give little bit of context about my self. I am an average guy. I have done my major in computer science. I didn't have passion for anything. I start coding in my clg. during that time I spend lot of time in internet and surf the internet all day long. I start understanding the things about computers.\n\nDuring those time I hoped on lot of things and try to learn my things but never completed one. For example I learn python, C, C++, spend some time with flutter and play little with android. Mean to say I try to introduced my self each and everything present out there. So you can say I have decent understanding about some things that are related to programming and stuff. \n\nI don't know its a quality or not but I consider it as a quality that I can look things and try to came up with a solution of the problems in front of me with knowledge and skill I am having. For instance, i recently joined as a technical support in a company. My daily job is to look the incidents and try to troubleshoot them, if they are not solvable by then pass to developers, sending report to the customer etc. Its more like a non-tech kind of role. So, I know basic python and bash script. So there is one report which we have to send every month to our customers. So what I did I wrote a script and which automatically send that report on 1st of every month to our customers.  This kind of small stuff I was talking about.\n\nParallelly I indulge my self in a training which teaches Linux, docker, k8S, etc. which is going good. I am referring and reading lot of books related to the domain.  Also write blog or small tutorial on the concepts which I am learning. So for learning wise i can say everything is going good.  \n\nBut as I reading and learning  stuff there are ideas start following in my mind for example like one time I was reading something about load balances. And I want to implement a small piece of idea which something like this \" suppose we have 3 server which are connected to a load balancer, now we send a request to those servers along with a dictionary of username corresponding to those three server for example {server-A:\"1234\", server-B: \"ewfa\", server-C:\"wehfiwh\"} . Now what I was thinking when load balance get this request and decide which server among servers A,B,C it will send the request then along with request that variable which came as null earlier got populated with corresponding server name\".  This is a small piece of idea and i don't worry if it is a relevant or not but I just want to \"CODE IT\". But I couldn't.\n\nI am here to ask a simple thing if it is possible what ever idea no matter how big or small it is but I am able to code it and implement that idea using code. I know somethings may be technology specific like if there is a small mobile app i want to make then I have to learn some specific tool but I am asking in general how and what should I learn to able implement with code what ever going in my head?",

They'll be 100% replaced. \n\nNow as for myself, I work in a factory, I have a degree in industrial maintenance technology. \n\nI do have a small programming background mostly in robotics (FANUC) to be specific. And PLCs. \n\nI've also written some stuff in python but I'm not a wizard with code or anything. \n\nRecently I began getting a degree in computer programming from my local community College, it transfers to pretty much every university in the state, and I always loved computers, I've built them studied for the A+ and started studying for network+. Am I going to actually take the cert tests? Idk. But I do study the curriculum just cause I love computers. \n\nAlso I'm into industrial controls and stuff, which a lot of PLCs are networked and stuff so this knowledge can be used for my current manufacturing job. \n\nWell I also just want to become a good computer programmer, I started doing the odin project and getting into building websites.

What if I'm just wasting my time? \n\nI've used chatgpt though and like, dude it got into an argument with me over how to calculate percentages. It kept giving me the wrong answer and I knew it was wrong. It eventually noticed its mistake and corrected itself. But something that can make a mistake calculating a percentage of a wage increase (that's literally what it was lol) should not be trusted with writing clean code. \n\nBut it's a beta, it'll eventually just replace every programmer on earth. \n\nThen I argued if it can do that, it could replace any job then. \n\nIdk, according to the bureau of labor statistics, web developers will be increasing by 23% in the next 10 years. That's faster than average and I've looked at tons of jobs. \n\nCyber security is seeing a big increase as well, tech jobs in general. \n\nBut idk, BLS could be wrong. Idk.

        "text": "Surprised I didn't think to ask here first. \n\nI'm a big fan of learning about operating systems internals, especially older, more obscure OSes. I'm currently taking a graduate level class in advanced OSes and we've been doing a lot of reading on microkernels, particularly Jochen Liedtke's [L4 microkernel family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family). One paper that's caught my eye is his [On µ-Kernel Construction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/224056.224075) where he tears down the myth that microkernels are inherently non-performant by going into detail on his approach in the L3 microkernel, as well as [Improved Address Space Switching on Pentium Processors by Transparently Multiplexing User Address Spaces](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=d0de4cc9625833af9aabe79c45dc2a5b2cd6517d). The original L3 and L4 microkernels were written in assembly, and it sounds like the optimizations were downright insane, so I'd love to actually dig into the source.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems the original x86 assembly sources to L3 and L4 have disappeared from the internet. \n\nIf you visit the website for [L4/x86](http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/l4down.html), there is a link to http://www-set.gmd.de/download/ that is broken. \n\nSome Googling turned up https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=17185, which has a link [claiming to have the original assembly sources for L3 and L4](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/white_papers/incoming/GMD/L4/) but it's dead too.\n\nI've also tried scouring the internet archive with little success. If anyone here either has a copy, or knows of any old software repositories that might be worth looking at I would be greatly appreciative. Alternately, if there's another subreddit that this question is better suited for, please let me know.\n\nThanks again for any help you might can provide!",

Also there is a memory cost based on the load factor. Is there a data structure that may fit my problem better? An efficient sorted traversal would be a nice extra, but I may also keep a sorted array of keys. Expected size of D should be a couple million entries and expected size of K should be a quarter of a million keys for queries and inserts/updates. Removes are most of the time done with fewer keys.",

        "text": "I'm currently writing a Chess AI which uses the negamax algorithm with a heuristic function. I have the heuristic function give a board rating between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates a winning position for white and -1 for black. My heuristic currently has 7 data points, where the pieces score (i.e. +3 if white is up material) comprises 70% of the overall score, etc.\n\nI'm currently exploring ways to optimize the ratios to find a more optimal set of ratios. For example, the heuristic might be better if that score above is only 60% and other data points have higher weights in return. I'd like to do some kind of genetic algorithm, tournament algorithm, or evolutionary algorithm to help optimize those values. The idea I'm exploring is to create an initial population with randomized heuristic data point weights, then have them compete against each other in games of chess and have the winners reproduce or move onto the next rounds.\n\nI think a normal genetic algorithm would not work in this case because the fitness function would depend upon another chromosome, and would therefore not be a universal/absolute standard in the value it returns, and it might make coupling with other chromosomes awkward. I'm also not sure how exactly I would merge the data point weights between two chromosomes.\n\nI also considered simply generating the entire population and having all of them perform in a large tournament. However, if I were to do so and I made each datapoint take a percentage between 0 and 100%, there would be roughly 80 trillion tournaments.\n\nI have a basic understanding of AI but this subject is outside of my area of knowledge, if someone can recommend some reading material or a particular kind of algorithm to look into, I'd appreciate it!",
