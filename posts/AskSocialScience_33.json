        "text": "So through the past, I've repeatedly had the impression that Jews often seem to be of high education or high socioeconomic statuts. Many famous people such as Franz Kafka or Sigmund Freud who had influence in pre-WW 2 Europe (and beyond) were of Jewish believe or ethnicity. \n\nNow that I've seen [this] (http://wp_media-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2015/09/24112730/Infographic_Design_Example_GOOD.jpeg) graph of contemporary America it kind of revived this impression. \n\nI know that in medieval Europe, Christians were forbidden to enter certain professions, and the other way round, Jews were probably prohibited and shunned from entering many areas of society and this might have had an influence on wealth of Jews beyond medieval times in later generations. It also seems that (maybe?) in WW2, especially rich or well-educated Jews would have been more likely to emigrate to the US, because they were able to recognize the danger earlier and had the ressources to go. \n\nSo my questions would be:\n\n* Was there an actual correlation between higher socioeconomic status and Jewish believe/ehtnicity in pre-WW2 europe?\n\n* If so, what historical and/or cultural, theologic, reasons are there for this? As in, does Jewish theology especially stress the importance of education?\n\n* Is the association of Judaism/Wealth caused by the same reasons for both pre-WW Europe and contemporary America?\n\n* Partly related question: How prevalent was Jewish believe in Europe before WW2?\n\nNote: I'm aware that I partially confuse Jewish believe and ethnicity/ancestry. This is partly because I am not sure of how much Christian and Jewish people would mix up family-wise and also because I feel that socio-economic differences between people of Jewish believe and -ancestry might overlap.\n\nThanks for your answers!",

No respect for the rule of law.\n* Wildly corrupt government, [officials do what they can to enrich themselves](http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/operation-car-wash/), no concerns for making taxpayers' lives better\n* Lots of littering\n* No safety precautions, driving without seatbelts, riding motorcycles without helmets...\n\nDo social scientists have a word, or a field of study, for this set of characteristics? Or am I conflating too many things together? \n\nPeople whose professions involve dealing with this cultural divide: What do you call it? How do you think about it? What causes it? Do you think there is any hope of those people becoming \"better\" citizens?\n\nIt seems to me that it's self-perpetuating: You grow up in a county where \"the system\" doesn't work (i.e. where the few people who are honest and wait their turn and do the right thing all end up just getting screwed, where people do bad things and never get caught) so you start doing these things too (in order to be on a level playing field with everyone else, rather than being a victim), thus bringing all this crap with you one generation further into the future.

I see myself as a mix of black and white (because I am) but people, when describing me to one of their friends say that I'm black and don't follow it with \"and white\" or \"mixed\". Is there a reason as to why someone wouldn't just say that I'm mixed? Is it because my skin color is any color but white, so they just define me as black? I see myself as mixed, so why don't others?\n\nEDIT: First off, thank you everyone for your responses as it has shed some light on why this happens so frequently. \n\nSecondly, I am familiar with the term \"mulatto\" because when I was younger (Elementary and Middle school) my mother would tell me to fill out those forms where they ask questions about gender and race (I forget what the proper name of the form was) and bubble in the \"Other\" answer and where it said clarify I would write Mulatto. \n\nThird, yes I do live in North America, more specifically, Arizona where African-Americans aren't everywhere so I guess when people meet me and find out that I'm half, they immediately jump to describing me as black due to the \"One Drop Rule\" which kind of makes sense. I can't tell if that's a form of racism though if you're judging simply based off \"one drop\", or in my case, many drops of black being in my blood. Am I wrong to see something that way, or am I justified in seeing it as very minuscule form of unintentional racism?",

Just came back from a lengthy and heated rant that I'm sure will be suuuuper poorly received in /r/Norway.\n\nI did my undergrad in sociology in Boston, where my focus was on contemporary race theory and Marxist sociology. The bad news about Norway is that the word \"race\" and therefore the study of race and racism is racist, because \"vi alle er jo bare norsk\" and \"rase has a pseudo-scientific biological meaning\" and \"ethnicity is a viable alternative\", try as you may to explain that language is not static and that references to \"race\" are purely Weberian. Double down on the discourse and you'll get shut down faster than you can say \"colorblind racism\".\n\nI was hoping someone here might be familiar with any work coming from Norwegian universities (programs, actual sociologists, even a paper or two written in English would be an excellent starting point). I've had trouble finding any with courses taught in English, and most seem to be oriented towards future careers in social services (read: NAV, you pick which end of it) and/or heavily focused on liberal sociology.",

In the latter instance, scientists come up with a technological advance that they or an employer seeks to commercialize.\n\nWhat happens when the possibilities created by a technology outpace society's ability to adjudicate those possibilities or their results?\n\nI am aware of Albert Hirschman's writings on conservative reaction to new ideas, and on early justifications for capitalism, but his is an ideological/intellectual history approach. I am looking for literature on and examples of how societal accommodation is reached. One could point to patents as one institutional response to problems created by innovation. One could argue that innovators litigate, or lobby legislators, as a tactic to help shape the field of contestation. But what occurs where an innovator cannot rely upon functioning institutions (such as an independent judiciary, etc)? The innovator believes that she has created something and wants to capture the value that flows from her creation. What I am looking for are hypotheses/examples of how arrangements have been designed to explain the possibilities of a new technology and to reach an accommodation with societal stakeholders, ideally one which creates value that the latter group can partake of.\n\nOne somewhat abstract article I ran across in this general vein is Carlota Perez, 2004, \"Technological Revolutions, Paradigm Shifts and Socioinstitutional Change.\" Am eager to learn of works that describe concrete examples that illustrate particular ways these issues have been managed.
