        "author": "epiphinehas",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zbu4z2/a_question_about_rortys_project_in_philosophy_and/",
        "text": "About halfway through reading Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, a passage turned me cold and unsympathetic to Rorty's work:\n\n\"Pigs rate much higher than koalas on intelligence tests, but pigs don't writhe in quite the right humanoid way, and the pig's face is the wrong shape for the facial expressions which go with ordinary conversation. So we send pigs to slaughter with equanimity, but form societies for the protection of koalas. This is not \"irrational,\" any more than it is irrational to extend or deny civil rights to the moronic (or fetuses, or aboriginal tribes, or Martians).\"\n\n*~ Part Two, Chapter IV*\n\nI understand that Rorty is attempting to show that Quine and Sellars' psychological nominalism is compatible with \"kindness to babies and animals\" and not to be thought of as some monstrous dehumanizing attack.\n\nHowever, the callous manner of Rorty's example seems to suggest exactly that, in addition to being a difficulty for the view he's proposing. His idea is supposed to be democratic: it's the community which decides what counts as knowledge, not the privileged \"raw feels\" of invdividual beings. However, as an \"aboriginal\" person myself, the way in which Rorty casually lumps the \"moronic\" and the alien in with Indigenous peoples, brings to my mind the relationship with which indiginous communites *actually* interact with majority white, colonized communities on which their fate largely depends: this sort of casual regard/indifference on the part of whites combined with an implicit assumption of the meaning-making power of the white majority culture. We know precisely what it is like to have \"raw feels\" and \"privileged representations\", not to mention civil rights, extended (or not extended) to us by a society in whose hands we are kept. Rorty imagines that this distinction (\"prying raw feels and justified true belief apart and depriving raw feels of their status as privileged representations\") isn't monstrous, but I would argue that Rorty's view is itself a privileged view.\n\nWhat it suggests is that for indiginous cultures, in order to be self-asserting and self-respecting, psychological nominalism must be rejected as a primarily majority-power oriented epistemology, meant to serve only those with privileged access to and identification with that society. The difficulty for Rorty's project here seems to be, therefore, that any kind of individual must be able to appeal to something beyond the dictates of any given culture. An indigenous person can find meaning that flows from his \"privileged respresentations\" independently of the power Rorty would ascribe to white-majority Western culture. If, one day, Western culture decides that indigenous peoples aren't sufficiently sympathy-generating and chooses with perfect \"equanimity\" to send them to slaughter, is it true that this choice would not be \"irrational,\" as Rorty suggests?\n\nOn this view, indigenous communites ought to feel nothing but gratitude for the benevolence of our colonial captors, who we realize can decide to do away with us and be totally justified and \"rational\".\n\nI'd been enjoying Rorty's dismissal of philosophy as a field supposedly incapable of grounding anything in the privileged representations, but now I'm skeptical of the foundations on which *his* project rests. Does anyone know of any powerful critiques of Rorty's (and by extension Quine's and Sellars') psychological nominalism and epistemological behaviorism? Rorty frames the philosopher's attachment to ideas about \"qualia\" and raw feels as a fear response to irrelevance; it's remarkable to me how consonant this is with the cynical, majority-culture view toward indigenous self-determination with respect to the supposed eminence of Western meaning-making power.",

        "text": "The pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and truth is the broadest definition for philosophy. Greek for \"love of wisdom,\" the term itself. Philosophical dilemmas include those pertaining to the nature of the cosmos and each of us, the boundaries of human knowledge, one's own values, and the purpose of existence. Philosophical thought has been practiced throughout history, in all cultures, and in all academic disciplines. Philosophy sets one field of study apart from all others in the academic world, including the arts and other social sciences. Philosophers typically consider issues that are a little bit more broad-based. For instance, while philosophers ponder the nature of justice and whether these causes were truly just, historians study historical figures who fought for justice. There are many subfields of philosophy. In today's subsection, we'll talk about consequentialism. \n\nAccording to the consequentialist viewpoint, the outcomes of an action are the only factors to be taken into account when making moral decisions. Consequentialists typically argue that we should always choose the course of action that will produce the best overall outcomes for all of the people it will affect. Since consequentialism is a complex theory, there have been many discussions about its specifics. Even so, whereas a individual can \"aspire\" his actions to bring about a specific result, the result is typically out of ones control.   Some consequentialists acknowledge that the morality of the act may depend in part on the agent's intention. The question then becomes: who has the right to decide whether or not the acting agent adequately took the intention into consideration? an unbiased and objective third party? a collection of guidelines? Attempting to claim that morality is solely based on the actual effect and that \"almost\" only makes a difference, \"actual\" consequentialists dismiss the entire discussion of the \"almost\" consequentialists.",

        "text": "  \n\nSo, I am still having trouble disentangling the flowing concepts:\n\n1) The harshness and cruelty of life\n\n2) The difficulty of making money\n\n3) The nature, acquisition and implications of knowledge and wisdom versus ignorance\n\n4) What I mean to be a person who is “valuable” i.e., a person whose time and abilities are worth significant money\n\nI entered into mental adolescence (I suffered from developmental delay) with the premise of “life is hard because of money. You have to suffer to make money. The amount you have to suffer is directly proportional to the amount of money you make. If you are poor, you suffer. But in order to make money you have to suffer too. You can never have enough money; you can never earn enough money. Therefore, you are in for a life of endless suffering just to survive. \n\nI thought about all of the suffering in the world was going to make me endure and I was so angry and bitter that I wanted revenge on the world and wanted to make others suffer as I surely would. And I did. But the ones I did it to were those who cared for me and tried to help me, although that was not really what I intended. \n\nI think of Mark Twain’s quote about a dog. “If you take in a staving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the main difference between a dog and a man”. Well, I am certainly a textbook example of that. It is something I am not proud of. \n\nSomething that I learned from the Buddhist course that I am listening to is the sentiment that suffering is caused by ignorance. I found that to be an intriguing concept. I remember that I had a Tai Kwan Doe sensei who said that ignorance was tantamount to and the cause of evil. It makes sense. And evil causes suffering. Interesting that we have to suffer to dispel our ignorance. Or if you consider ignorance the absence of something namely knowledge, experience and wisdom, the price of these things is pain. Both Mental and physical.\n\nPoverty is often the result of ignorance. But there is not only financial poverty. There is poverty of thought, poverty of knowledge and wisdom and experience. Poverty of social capital and status. Financial wealth and a wealth of these other things go together. In fact, if you initially have financial wealth but have a poverty of these other things, you will soon be in financial poverty too.\n\nSo, knowledge, wisdom and experience have value and these valuable aspects should bring one financial asset in turn.\n\nSo, can we conclude from all this that poverty is evil? Well poverty certainly causes suffering and suffering also caused by evil.\n\nSo, a question is how are the following related…. Evil, Poverty, ignorance and suffering?\n\nDo we have correlation? Causation? Both? And how much of each between all of the variables?\n\nThis seems to be an intractable problem for me. To come u with a unified theory would be such a generalization that I don’t think it could be logically applied to all scenarios",

        "text": "Watch this [short clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBXUBYYEHhk) of Chomsky on socialism. Till the 2:30 mark is enough for the purposes of this question.\n\nChomsky explains how the term 'socialism' was co-opted by the two superpowers (for their own particular political ends) to refer to a Marxist-Leninist one-party dictatorship as epitomized by the Soviet Union.\n\nHe then explains what socialism *really is*. This is the part that interests me. What determines what a word really means? I don't think you can appeal to the dictionary, since dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive. The real meaning is therefore explanatorily prior to what the dictionary says is the real meaning.\n\nIf we appeal to usage, then the question becomes - who's usage? Is it the general population? Well then I think it might end up being a very confused, poor definition with unfortunate consequences, such as if the masses are brainwashed into accepting a definition that serves the ends of nefarious organizations.\n\nMy guess right now is that the \"ownership\" of words changes according to some set of rules. If a word is technical, such as 'cardiac arrest', then the word's meaning is determined by how cardiologists use the term. If it's non-technical, then it'll be determined by the general population. But certain non-technical words are also said to be commonly misused, such as 'literally' and 'begs the question'. And I think technical terms in politics are unique in that they face \"interference\" unlike cardiac arrest. Say, what if experts are also influenced by powerful groups about the true definition of political terms?\n\nChomsky seems to appeal to how the word was used when socialism was first conceived (19th century working class press) as the 'true definition'. But the meaning of words evolve over time, so a when-first-conceived rule seems to fall short too. I do agree with him that this is what it \"should\" mean and for socialism in particular, I think it ought to be determined by the 19th century working class. But clearly that's not comprehensive because of the instability of meaning that I just alluded to.\n\nSo yeah I'm quite lost here. I'd really like an overview of what philosophers of language think with some relevant readings. (I hope this doesn't count as test-my-theory, I am just trying to explain my thought process here, not trying to defend a viewpoint).\n\nPinging /u/shitgenstein since he seems like he knows quite a bit about philosophy of language and adjacent areas.",

        "text": "Had this thought while browsing subreddits about Ukraine, as every day. I just can't wrap my head around war. The more I think about it, the more questions I have. I started thinking about war as about Nature - from the perspective of one human/animal. Is war natural, not regarding the possibility of it's occurence, but in the purest meaning of the word \"Nature\"? There are just so many similarities. \n\nIt's basically a man returing to savanna. And not even as an apex predator. Much lower on a food chain. As a soldier in war you're spending your days and nights in a place you're not totally familiar with, a place that is not safe. Your goals are reduced to eating and sleeping. Your strongest will is to survive, everything comes after that. You can't be ever sure you'll see the sun in the sky again. You are never sure if you'll eat that day, or be able to sleep well this night. Or to sleep at all. You're the hunter of energy, and always on the watch. You can die at any moment. You're looking for food, so you become strong and clever enough to keep yourself alive today. All the needs you used to have are gone. Watching TV, gaming, spending hourse on Reddit... are gone. Only the animalistic ones stay. \n\nI know what's missing - sex. I think that this is the only difference, where the reproduction of animals is being represented by the will to protect those who belong to you. War is therefore nature minus reproduction plus protection. I know that animals protect each other, especially when they belong to one pack/herd. In soldier's case I see more of an organized protection with premeditated actions to achieve it, that's why I differentiate between these two now. \n\nWhat scares me is the sudden change these soldiers must go through. From the world of men, where you have rights and you are safe, to a world where practically anything can happen, nothing is certain and death is present everywhere. You don't usually experience death around you, animals do.  \n\nJust my thoughts. Feel free to say/share anything, I'd be happy to see what you think of war, if you were able to grasp how terrifying and extremely strange it is. Or that you think/don't think the same. Cheers.

And what parts of philosophy are more in the category of literature that would never be re-discovered because it basically just amounts to \"here is some cool stuff this guy thought about\"?

The central questions is:\n\n&gt;**\"How should medical professionals approach situations where there is potential the patient is concealing self-destructive motivations for seeking medical attention?\"**\n\nOur current understanding of the way the mind works is  incomplete, and that incompleteness causes difficulty in determining the  clinical course of treatment for mental illness. Treatment of  personality disorders is a particularly good example of this. Although  current theories of mind and clinical models for treatment of mental  illnesses are effective to various degrees in the treatment of many  mental illnesses, some conditions, such as personality disorders and  catatonia, and poorly understood in terms of their causal mechanisms, as  well as the subjective effects of the condition from the patient's  perspective. For this reason, novel conceptual frameworks are needed to  formalize clinical courses for these types of patients.\n\nThis  thought experiment encourages viewing the mind from an  open-individuality or collective-individuality standpoint, with the goal  of developing novel frameworks for interpreting a patient's record of  their experience in order to determine the best clinical course of  treatment for that patient.\n\nFollowing the writeup of the thought experiment are 9 questions for analysis, on any one of which I would gladly welcome discussion or further questions.\n\nI'd appreciate this sub's participation in the thought experiment, and, if I may, request your kind attention and thoughtful discussion of the questions following the thought experiment.",

For trans people who identify as one gender but are in the closet and do not perform in ways which correspond with the gender they identify with, what would Butler say about their gender? Is butler's point that in our society they are seen as the gender they are performing, but that people can self determine their gender despite this? Or do they need to perform the gender they identify with to be that gender? \n\n2) Does Judith Butler consider how marginalized people may be disproportionally unable to “perform” gender expressions out of fear of violence? \n\nSorry if these are dumb questions.

        "text": "A common argument for moral realism is that, all other things being equal, it is usually justified to assume that one’s own intuitions represent truth. One of these intuitions related to morality, which people in western culture hold to very strongly, is that the Nazis were wrong to murder Jews just because they were Jews. However, it was equally intuitively obvious to the Nazis that murdering Jews just because they were Jews was the right thing to do. Given this, it seems we have no reason to assume there is a truth-value to the statement, “Murdering Jews just because they’re Jews is inherently morally wrong.”\n\nA common response to this type of argument is to say that there are differences of opinion about science as well, but while this shows that differences of opinion about morality are not in themselves strong evidence that morality exists, they are also not evidence in favor of the existence of morality. Furthermore, while it is possible to resolve differences of opinion about science with empirical data, it is not clear how we would resolve differences of opinion about morality without reference to our intuitions. One could perhaps say that one moral system is more consistent than another, but then why is consistency inherently good in moral systems?\n\nOne could respond to that by saying that on reflection, people usually prefer moral systems which are consistent, and that would give us a coherent definition of morality - one which resembles the ideal observer theory (although this particular version relies on the assumption that the ideal observer described by the theory is human or at least evolved). However, I am not sure this definition would be accepted by all or even most ethicists. \n\nFurthermore, when defined this way, the question, “Does morality exist?” becomes an empirical question, one we could theoretically test by, for example, giving humans from a variety of different cultures ten thousand years to reflect on their own moral intuitions, or perhaps by building a superintelligent AI and letting it do the thinking (reasoning about human values) for us. It’s not obvious to me that such a test would result in a single coherent moral system, and assuming that such an experiment would prove or disprove moral realism, a Science of Morality of the kind espoused by Sam Harris seems much more important than most ethicists seem to assume.",

It feels like as I go through a text I have some initial response in my mind for every point that's brought up, but trying to remember them all as a connected argument in the end is hard. While reading I have to have some way of tying all the information back together, and I find that my brain naturally does it visually so I want to find some method to make it work, or if not then try to improve my abstract memory.

        "text": "I've been looking for folks who try to advance Hegel's system in light of developments in the sciences and philosophy since his time. I can find a lot of good sources that explore Hegel's work, and a lot of individual papers in the sciences that try to apply Hegel's ideas, but I'd like to find someone who does this on a more systematic basis, rather than secondary sources that simply focus on Hegel's work or Hegelians who don't pay much attention to the sciences or ontology.\n\nFor instance, Hegel had a huge influence on Pierce, and Pierce has been a central figure in the emergence of biosemiotics and information theoretic approaches to biology (e.g. Terrance Deacon's work). The field of complexity studies and the fact that complexity only emerges at the borderlands between too much order and too much chaos seems like a perfect topic for Hegelian analysis. I've also seen Hegel's name come up in papers looking at pansemiosis in physics, new attempts to formalize the dialectical in mathematics, and some cognitive science papers. Information theoretic approaches to the sciences in particular seem like fertile ground for this type of work, e.g., some forms of \"It From Bit,\" seem like they would work well with Absolute Idealism. \n\nFor an example: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://engineering.lehigh.edu/sites/engineering.lehigh.edu/files/_DEPARTMENTS/ise/pdf/tech-papers/21/21T_004.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv6_nHm9v7AhUrjokEHRl7AXwQFnoECBMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ADs1mjjSyXaozdE2kmRX9 \n\nI've also seen some arguments for idealism that seem like they would fit quite well with Hegel's philosophy. For example, the cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman has a book, \"The Case Against Reality,\" that argues for idealism while using scientific models of reality as a starting point.\n\nI was hoping to find an author who had put all these threads together in one place. The articles I've found are great, but they're more a patchwork of ideas.",

Because to me, these two have always struck me at face value as being completely indistinguishable epistemically from each other. Unlike in the case of logical necessity, in which something is necessarily true/false purely by virtue of either the proposition’s structure or the stipulated meaning of terms leading to a contradiction or incoherent alternative, with metaphysical necessity there just doesn’t seem to be any non-circular reason to assume/support the claim of necessity.\n\nSo again, it seems like just brute contingency in disguise.",
