My question is according to this [Twitter reply thread to Schiff's comment](https://twitter.com/drawandstrike/status/874440840718028800) by a very conservative user it's not possible for congress to establish an independent counsel, and that the Attorney General has to do so.\n\nNot knowing enough about this myself I am inclined to believe Schiff knows what he is talking about, but would anyone be able to share some insight on where the argument (or semantics) are coming from here, and if this scenario is a possibility either way.",

Would this be effective fiscal policy? Could a country, such as Canada, implement a revenue neutral removal of corporate tax rate by shifting the burden to other forms of taxation?

        "text": "[This](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/bernie-sanders-chris-van-hollen-russell-vought/529614/) is an article on the confirmation hearing of Russel Vought for the position of Deputy Director of the Office of Budget and Management. [This](https://www.budget.senate.gov/nomination-hearing-for-deputy-director_of-white-house-budget-office) is a video of the hearing. The part in question begins at 44:20. Transcript found [here.](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448393/watch-bernie-sanders-unconstitutionally-impose-religious-test-public-office)\n [This](http://theresurgent.com/wheaton-college-and-the-preservation-of-theological-clarity/) is the \"The Resurgent\" article in which Mr. Vought's statement is found.\n\nThe statement to which Sen. Sanders is taking offense is a centrally orthodox view of all but a minority of Christians. The Trinity Foundation, which advocates an exclusivist view of Christianity, states that exclusivism has been the primary stance of Christians throughout history. They discuss the various positions (exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism) [here](http://www.trinityfoundation.org/journal.php?id=114).\nThat Christ is central to salvation and those who reject him stand condemned by God has been a key tenet of Christianity. \n\nSome, such as those mentioned in the *Atlantic* article suggest that Sen. Sanders challenge is a litmus test that would place Christians in a position in which they cannot hold public office. Others, such as the author of [this](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_593af9d0e4b014ae8c69e030) Huffington Post article, believe that Sen. Sanders was simply trying to see if Mr. Vought would discriminate against non-Christians in his official position.\n\nThanks!",

Final polls before today showed a lot of variation, [anywhere from an enormous Conservative lead to a small Labour lead.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2017)\n\nSo it will be interesting to see what transpires tonight.  There are 650 seats up for election, so one party must win 326 (or slightly fewer) for a majority government.  Otherwise, we would have a hung parliament.  In the event of a hung parliament, I suggest turning to [this cabinet manual document describing the formation of government.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60646/election-rules-chapter6-draft_0.pdf)  \n\nI will begin a tick-tock around 10 PM BST when polls close. \n\nFor those wanting to watch, I found [this stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60wDzZt8yg) of Sky News.  I have been looking for a stream of the BBC as well that works outside the UK but no luck so far.  For those in the UK here is the [iPlayer link.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcnews)\n\n[Found a live-stream of BBC news that shows their election coverage outside the UK.](http://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454)\n\n---\n\n**10:07 PM BST:**  Polls have now closed.  [Exit polls are indicating](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40208731) that the Conservatives will have the largest party in Parliament, but may wind up short of a majority.\n\n\n**10:11 PM BST** As this is looking hung-parliament-y I should correct my prior assertion that 326 is needed for a majority, as several MPs [may not vote for any government (the speaker)](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-39999096), or not be seated for refusal to swear loyalty to the Queen.  For this slight against the Right Honourable Speaker Mr. Bercow, here is a [video of him in full command of his House.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvIUa47x_Oc)\n\n**10:25 PM BST**  SNP MP says on BBC it would be \"hard to see in the current climate\" that he could support a Queen's speech (confidence vote) for the Conservatives.\n\n**10:48 PM BST**  Labour's Barry Gardner says if Labour wins a plurality they will try to govern as a minority without a coalition.\n\n**11:00 PM BST** Newcastle result is first one in.  Labour got 65% and held the seat, gaining 10% over their last result.  Conservatives were up 6%  UKIP down 11%. \n\n**11:06 PM BST**  Sunderland is in as well.  Labour holds.\n\n**Midnight BST; Lab: 4, Con: 1**  North Swindon in, Conservatives hold, but with a 3.7% swing to Labour (both gaining at the expense of UKIP).  \n\n**12:20 AM BST; Lab 6; Con 1** Still a long way from anything decisive.  In safe Labour seats they seem to have a Conservative swing, though that may not be representative.  So far mostly safe Labour seats have been in.\n\n**12:35 AM BST; Lab 6, Con 3**\n\nGoing to do an aside on how transitions of government in the UK work.  Sourced to the Cabinet doc linked above.  In the event of anything short of a Labour majority, May could remain on as Prime Minister and test her government in the Commons with a throne speech. If she failed to maintain confidence, or resigned in expectation of failure, then the Queen could try to invite Mr. Corbyn to form a government instead, or she might call a second election.  Traditionally a second election is strongly disfavored, but it would be a strange situation with a party that achieved a significantly behind second place result (if the exit poll shakes out) forming a coalition or minority government cobbled together like that.  \n\nFor fans of crazy politics it would be a very interesting time.  Doubly so with the [fixed 2 year deadline over exit from the EU looming.](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21719758-it-leaves-britain-little-time-get-through-bulging-contentious-agenda-two-year-countdown)\n\nIt is also worth noting that inasmuch as the Queen has the power to invite a leader to form government, or to call a second election, this is an area where she exercises actual political power as opposed to her normal role as a pure figurehead.\n\n**12:38 AM BST; Lab 6, Con 4**  Seems [YouGov is having a good night in regard to their projections.](https://twitter.com/MC_of_A/status/872949123892334592)  Might be therefore looking at their [pre-vote projection](https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2017/) (which was for hung parliament).\n\n**12:47 AM BST; Lab 8, Con 5**  [Nate Silver doing a little number crunching.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/872963087091027968) \n\nAverage gain/loss across 13 constituencies so far (per @britainelects)\nCon: +7.9\nLab: +9.0\nUKIP -13.6\nLibDem: -1.1\nGreen: -2.4\n\n**1:15 AM BST; Lab 15, Con 7** We have our first seat change of the night, SNP have lost Rutherglen and Hamilton West to Labour.\n\n**1:32 AM BST; Lab 22, Con 10, DUP 2, SNP 1**  [Huge swing in Tooting](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/872972728852152320) (Lab Hold)  Former seat of London Mayor Khan.\n\n**1:35 AM BST** Last result I typo'd and gave Labour 11 extra seats.  Fixed now.\n\n**1:36 AM BST Lab 22, Con 11, DUP 2, SNP 1** [Big swing towards conservatives](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/872975207828525058) in the one seat SNP have held so far.\n\n**1:40 AM BST Lab 24, Con 12, DUP 2, SNP 1**  Labour have won Vale of Clwyd away from Conservatives.\n\n**1:55 AM BST Lab 35, Con 23, SNP 4, DUP 2** Conservatives have made a beefy gain in Angus away from the SNP.\n\n**2:03 AM BST Lab 43, Con 26, SNP 5, DUP 2** Labour wins a gain in Battersea with a 10% swing away from the Conservatives.\n\n**2:22 AM BST Lab 62, Con 48, SNP 11, SUP 3** BBC has updated their forecast to be Conservatives at 322, *juuuust* short of a majority.\n\n**2:37 AM BST Lab 86, Con 66, SNP 13, DUP 4** Looks like the Conservatives may cling on due to some gains against the SNP offsetting losses to Labour in England.\n\n**2:43 AM BST Lab 97, Con 72, SNP 13, DUP 5, PC 2, LD 1** Lib Dems win their first seat taken from the SNP.  SNP are having a rough night.\n\n**2:46 AM BST Lab 101, Con 79, SNP 14, DUP 5, PC 2, LD 1**  Nick Clegg, former LibDem leader and deputy prime minister in the 2010-15 coalition has lost his seat.\n\n**3:03 AM BST Lab 131, Con 107, SNP 17, DUP 7 PC 3, LD 2, SF 2**  We are now almost halfway through getting seats in and we have Labour up 12 seats, Conservatives down 4, SNP down 8, and the DUP up 1.  If the DUP coalition with the Conservatives and current trends hold, the Conservatives may squeak through a throne speech on this result. \n\nPressure would certainly be on May to resign as PM given the catastrophic result as compared to her prior position and what she expected out of this election, however that could also be a dicey decision since then a new government would need to be formed and the advantages of incumbency in that prospect would be lost to the Conservatives.\n\n**3:08 AM BST Lab 136, Con 117, SNP 19, DUP 7, PC 3, LD 2, SF 2**  Corbyn has won his seat easily.\n\n**3:23 AM BST Lab 162, Con 149, SNP 25, DUP 9, LD 4, SF 4, PC 3**  May has been re-elected.  We are more than halfway done now.  Conservatives are so far down 3 seats, Labour up 15.  SNP down 12.\n\n**3:27 AM BST Lab 169, Con 154, SNP 25, DUP 9, LD 5, SF 4, PC 3** BBC is now projecting Conservatives at 318.  \n\n**3:49 AM BST Lab 196, Con 190, SNP 27, DUP 10, LD 9, SF 6, PC 3**  Betting markets are now predicting a substantial chance of PM Boris Johnson!  https://electionbettingodds.com/  Saying ~50% May, 23% Johnson, 18% Corbyn.\n\n**4:08 AM BST Lab 219, Con 215, SNP 29, LD 10, DUP 10, SF 6, PC 3**  The Northern Irish situation may come to May's aid in this.  BBC is reporting that Sinn Fein will not take their seats (as they usually do not) and that would subtract 7 seats from the Commons.  With 4 seats removed for the Speaker and deputies (of which 1 would need to come from the Conservatives), that would mean they need 320 seats.  The DUP has been floated as a likely coalition partner, or at least likely to support them on confidence and supply.  So that could mean they can form government on ~310 seats.  But this is very tight and every seat will count.\n\n**4:52 AM BST Con 285, Lab 245, SNP 33, LD 10, DUP 10, SF 7, PC 3, Ind 1**  BBC is forecasting the conservatives at at 316 now, with 56 seats yet to be called.  If they get the DUP on side that gets them to the 326 line without much more funny business.  Very precarious position though to be depending on another party for confidence and supply.\n\n**5:06 AM BST Con 290, Lab 249, SNP 34, LD 11, DUP 10, SF 7, PC 3, Ind 1**  I am going to end the tick tock here.  Currently BBC forecast is for Conservatives to get a plurality of 318, with Labour at 262.  Definitely a hung Parliament.  We shall see tomorrow how things shake out, and whether Ms. May continues to be PM under the new Parliament.\n\n**5:23 AM BST Con 297, Lab 252, SNP 34, LD 11, DUP 10, SF 7, PC 3, Ind 1** One last update because I couldn't resist.  North East Fife seems to have a [one vote margin.](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/873031212821913603)  In a hung parliament this closely divided, it seems there may be some people in North East Fife who had their vote *really* count.\n",

Arthur Laffer, the main architect of the supply side economics policies of the Reagan administration, was a [consultant for, and proponent of, the Kansas experiment.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2012/03/06/laffers-supplyside-economics-staging-a-comeback) \n\nYesterday, faced with perennial budget shortfalls, the Kansas Legislature (in which Republicans still hold a majority) [voted to override Gov.

The bill enacts a series of changes, phased in over the coming years, that will bring the tax structure roughly back to its pre-2012 form.\n\nSo, now that the experiment has ended, what did we learn? Can we extend the conclusions to other states, or was there something specific about the economic situation in Kansas that caused it to have the results it did? Are there states similar to Kansas that did not enact such policies that we can use as a control?
