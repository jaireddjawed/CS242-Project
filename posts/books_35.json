It includes almost all of the most iconic short stories that I can think of and some commentary from the author afterwards. \n\nI've begun to develop an appreciation for the short story medium especially as someone with attention issues. The stories I've been reading have been quite powerful and memorable despite having much less space than a novel to develop their narrative. They are also short bursts of good writing to read before I go to bed each night -- almost like reading a fairytale or a fable. \n\nMy only complaint would be the small-ish font size, which I'm not used to after months of reading on my Kindle.",

I‚Äôm just genuinely curious about reading comprehension and how to know if mine is better than that of my friends?

We try to pick difficult reads and go through them together to try and make it easier. Our current read is Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow. We‚Äôre about a third ways through (we read a set number of pages before each meeting.) So far, everyone else has complained about the book. They‚Äôve said it‚Äôs slow and hard to understand and often they‚Äôve talked about passages or entire parts and have said they completely missed what was happening because it was too hard to understand and boring. I‚Äôm loving the book. It‚Äôs genius in parts and while the writing is certainly difficult, I haven‚Äôt had too much trouble. It‚Äôs probably my favorite read so far of the book club and we‚Äôve been meeting for almost a year. I try to bring this up in the club but the others keep saying they don‚Äôt like the book and don‚Äôt understand it. Why is that? Is this a difference in reading comprehension or just taste? We‚Äôve read similarly difficult books so I‚Äôm a tad confused. They‚Äôre even talking about dropping the book and moving on, which is upsetting because I like talking about it. Does anyone have any insight into this? I think our tastes are just different perhaps.",

Illogical persons are despised.\" And I thought to myself, \"Now this is a logical man.\" So I decided to grab the book along with its sequel.\n\nAnd it really is nothing like I was expecting.  From what I heard, Lewis Carrol wrote, or at least came up with the whole story in one night after some kids asked him to create a story for them and he was like, \"Okay.\"  I really like how none of the characters don't necessarily treat Alice like an outsider and none of them feel the need to explain themselves when ever she interacts with them.  She comes across a smoking caterpillar and asks him to tell her who he is, to which all he can think of to say is.  \"Why?\" Also when she came across a door mouse when she was just small and started talking to it, without knowing if it could talk back at all, about her cat.  The mouse just looked up at her and responded.  \"Why would you assume that I like cats?\"  Carrol really made the story something unique, not only with the world and characters but with how he wrote it all out to be, it really is like nothing else.",

It had only been on a few syllables the first few times, but today it was much worse. I was talking to my husband and felt my tongue getting heavy in my mouth and started to tell him that I‚Äôve been have trouble with stuttering lately and I couldn‚Äôt get the word stutter out. I repeated the first syllable 5 or so times and was completely taken aback. I‚Äôve never experienced this before. \n\nI have always enjoyed reading and often find that my inner monologue will be influenced by what I am reading. It will adapt to the pacing and tone of my current book. I may used more antiquated or British phrases depending on what I am reading, (ex. my husband teased me for calling the kitchen cabinets the cupboard) However this is the first time it has actually effected my actual speech. \n\nI finished the audiobook today. So I‚Äôm hoping that this was solely influenced by the descriptive language of the book and will now stop. It was a lovely book and I truly did enjoy it.",

I used to be able to use Alexa with Overdrive, but that's being phased out and replaced by Libby, and Libby isn't compatible with Alexa.

I would be open to downloading Libby and Hoopla audiobooks to an MP3 player, if that's possible and legal, because although an MP3 technically has a screen it can't be used surf the web, which is the point. Are there other platforms than Libby and Hoopla for free audiobook listening that are compatible with Alexa?

In which the girl ends up in a correctional school or boarding school where there are paranormal creatures.I read the vampire academy and the zodiac but they were not to my taste. I want something like Crave by Tracy Wolf. \n\n-I would like to find a book that has this idea in it. The girl moves with her family to a small town that is full of supernatural creatures or similar .\n\n-I don't mind it being spicy. \n\nI'm looking for books based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã1 main female character \n\nSo if readers know and are willing to share please leave a comment.Any books with the specs or similar to what I said above are welcome.

I've been trying to find this book title for years after I gifted the book to my fiance but he lost it during his move back home from AIT. \n\nIs there a subreddit I can get help from or is it best to get advice on it from here???? \n\nOn the off chance that I can get help from here, I'll post what I remember. \n\nIt's the story of a girl falling in love with a native American boy after staying with her aunt for a little while bc The aunt is pregnant and asks for the help of the girl bc she thought she was a virgin (she wasn't) for a ritual to help her have a baby bc The aunt had so many miscarriages before (it's not evil, the girl just had to hold The aunt or something while they were in sacred water) The aunt has a miscarriage during the book and later dies and the girl's mom comes back and runs off the native American boy bc she doesn't trust him and is super over protective of the girl. And the girl is in like a shock state from both events happening. And a lot of time later, she goes to college and writes letters to the boy who doesn't live in that trailer anymore (the letters go the sister who owns the trailer with her kids and the sister calls her brother to tell him about them bc he has a job fishing in Alaska I think????) And she girl sends a final letter which has a feather inside and she says that she'll wait for him one last time outside of her college on Berkeley on a bench and if he doesn't show up then she'll finally move on. He shows up and his hair is long and bam they're still in love. \n\nI remember a lot more but I feel like it'll get too chaotic the more I try to explain.\n\nPlease any help will be appreciated üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",

I actually love them so much that I am an employee in a small local bookshop where I live. \nI‚Äôm largely in charge of ‚Äúbooks in English‚Äù (I‚Äôm from a non-native English speaking country) and therefore know a lot about popular books in that section.\n\nNow.. BookTok has become a huge thing and I can see it in our sales and sometimes order books only due to their popularity on TikTok. Our absolutely best selling author in that category is Colleen Hoover, which is all nice and well. She clearly has a wide appeal especially to younger women.\n\nHowever.. what I‚Äôve found increasingly worrying is the fact that an increasing amount of 13-14 year old girls come in to buy those books. Even sometimes girls as young as 11-12. I always encourage reading, especially at that age, but the books they are buying (by the recommendation of BookTok) sometimes contain very adult themes such as brutality against women, the r-word and other horrid crimes. I find it incredibly difficult to sell some of those books to girls that young. I hate to say it, but I somewhat blame BookTok, and the very enticing and aesthetic videos on there. Girls that young are easily influenced by aesthetic. Of course not every video is like that, and some do a great job of adding +18. But some don‚Äôt.\n\nSadly there really isn‚Äôt much I can do, and will in rare cases ‚Äúlightly warn‚Äù the parent of the book‚Äôs themes when they brought along. \n\nAm I in the wrong for being worried?\n\nI have also had several sad encounters with some of them when warning them.",
