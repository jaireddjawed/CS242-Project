        "text": "I’m… not sure how I should go about doing this. \n\nI mean, I know I’m supposed to tell my story, explain what happened, but… I don’t know. I guess it’s hard to find a good place to start. I told what I found so far to a friend online, and he recommended this website where you can share stories about weird or paranormal crap, so, here I am.\n\nI think it would be best to start with me moving. I had lived in the country for most of my earlier years, but once I got a job in the city, I had to move closer. That job was the only real reason that I stayed for so long, so when I finally got fired (apparently they found someone “better qualified for the position.” Honestly, I wasn’t that upset. I’d only ever really been a placeholder) I decided to move back into a more rural area. \n\nI ended up going with somewhere close, but still far from any real cities. It’s a decently sized house, two floors and a basement, on the outskirts of a town called Ash Lake. True to its name, there’s a lake nearby, but most of the town is surrounded by woodland. There’s a small market that sells almost everything, a bakery, and a library, but other than that it’s all just houses and moose.\n\nA lot of moose.\n\nThe whole town is in a place called Brimstone County, which itself is located in Manitoba, Canada. It has an ominous name, yeah, but the people seem friendly enough.\n\nNone of that is why I’m here though. The reason I’m here is because of something that is decidedly *not* friendly. That part started a few days after I moved in. Everything was going well up until one night, when I heard some kind of… weird screaming, coming from the woods.\n\nIt was far away, I could tell that much. They didn’t seem to be getting closer, and whatever was making them didn’t seem to be an active threat, so eventually I just… went back to sleep. They kept happening though. Every night after that, sometimes closer, sometimes farther, but still always… distant, somehow. I’ve never heard them during the day, and nobody in town mentions anything about screams from the woods, so I just accepted it eventually.\n\nNow, I know your first thought about that is going to be that it’s some kind of bobcat or something, but it was no animal I’ve ever heard of that made those sounds. I got a recording of them one night, and they did show up, so I know it’s not just in my head. I would share the recording here, but this forum doesn’t seem to allow audio attachments.\n\nI tried comparing the recording to all kinds of audio libraries and park service websites, and nothing came even *close* to what I had heard. It definitely wasn’t a human, either. At least, I hope it wasn’t. A human that can make those kinds of noises honestly scares me more than any animal, natural or not.\n\nSo… yeah. That’s all I have for now I guess. I’ll make more posts if I find anything else, or something new comes up. Other than that, do you guys have any idea what this could be?",

        "text": " \n\nThe idea of time travel has always fascinated me.  From watching movies such as “Back to the future” to creating my own time traveling machines during math class to avoid hearing my teachers boring lectures , time travel was always on my mind.\n\nI grew up in Vancity Canada , we were a relatively prosperous family and had a lot of time and money in our hands . My father was an engineer and an inventor but unfortunately none of his inventions ever saw the light of day and were constantly rejected by  those stupid corporate people. Despite all the backlash he gained over the years , he never seemed to give up and was always looking for new opportunities to make a name for himself and make something that would make me and my mother look up to him.\n\nAnd he did …\n\nOnce he caught onto my obsession with time travel he didn’t waste any time and went straight to work . He looked through all his contacts to find someone that would be willing to help him turn his fantasy into a reality ,but everyone thought he had gone mad and many of his “friends” and “family” quickly turned their backs on him…\n\nHe was truly never the same after coming face to face with the rejection of his loved ones and people he thought were his friends , and during the 5 years it took him to make the machine , things only grew worse . It started off with him being locked in his room for long periods of time . Once he finally started to come out , he was unrecognizable…\n\nHis eyes were completely red and his hands were constantly shaking whenever he ate with us or talked to either one of us . This eventually led him to use drugs in order to calm down his anxiety . It didn’t take long until the drugs finally got to him and he started to display violent and erratic behaviors against me and my mother . The only place he seemed to find peace of mind was down there in the void along with the machine …\n\nJanuary 13th 2003 - “STEVE COME DOWN!!! I FINISHED IT,  I FINISHED IT !” he screamed . I’ll admit that I was pretty paranoid considering his behavior in the past but it seemed like this meant a lot to him so I went along with it and made my way down there..\n\nI wish I hadn’t …\n\nIt was pitch black in there , I walked slowly feeling around for something to hold onto , until I finally came across a doorknob . I yanked the door open and my eyes were immediately hit by a bright red light . I could see my father standing there , leaning against his work table with a giant smile spread across his face as he contemplated his creation.  A giant metal capsule .\n\nHe felt accomplished for once in his life …\n\nI’ll admit that during that moment his excitement got to me and I decided to leave my skepticism aside and let him enjoy his moment. My father exclaimed “ BEHOLD THE VIATOR!!!!” . He then walked up to me and handed me a pamphlet titled “***10 steps across time***” which I assumed was the owner's manual . I held it in my hand and flipped through a couple pages trying to configure all the weird symbols it displayed and by the time I looked back up I could see that the VIATOR’S door was closed shut and my dad was waving me goodbye from the other side . After a couple moments it started rattling violently and the red light started flashing quickly along with a loud siren! I tried desperately to pry the door open but just as quickly as everything started it stopped and the VIATOR was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI wish I had stopped him when I had the chance …\n\nI stood there for a long time until suddenly a bright light shined into the room and the Viator came into view once again . I quickly rushed towards it , opened the door but he wasn’t there anymore . I went into it but the only thing I could find was a giant black spike along with a piece of cloth  and the year he traveled to , it was the year 2028 . I slammed the door shut and in tears rushed up the stairs , my mother was in the kitchen and when I caught sight of her I explained to her everything I had just witnessed moments earlier . She seemed confused at first so I grabbed her hand and led her down into the void . Once I opened the door I could see her eyes fill up with tears as she looked into the Viators eyes and processed the reality of the situation .\n\nShe yanked me by the arm , rushed me out of the room and banned me from ever returning . I was fine with her decision through my middle and high school years but once I left home and headed towards college the curiosity regarding my fathers disappearance started to consume me. All I could think of during the past 2 years was of entering the void and coming face to face with my fears once again . This time , determined to solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nAll this brings us to today , my mother is away from home on a cruise to the Bahamas with a couple friends and she told me to watch over our dog . I already fed Max and now I’m making my way down there…\n\nIt’s either now or never , I’ll keep everyone updated.",

        "text": "Many people ask me why I love Berlin so much. And they rarely understand my answer: It's the way the city is alive.\n\nFor one, Berlin is a pretty green city, you know? Even many of the big and busy streets are lined with trees, and pools of green parks sprawl out amidst the buildings. Sometimes the life seems ugly - like the rats teeming across subway tracks or pigeons shitting from a bus stop's roof. But I am in love with it when the foxes scream at night and the cats howl during their hunts and fights. It makes me smile when the starlings and sparrows hop around me as I sit down on a bench, eagerly beeping to beg for food, and I happily tug some bits off my sandwich to toss among them.\n\nBut I think my favorite may be the crows. Even as a child, I found it hypnotising when their murders swarmed across the skies. It always felt like I could almost, *almost* recognise something in the shapes or their flight. Something significant. Something magical.\n\nI own no pets, but I buy cat treats every day. The good ones, too. All so I can seize the opportunities when the crows land on the lamp posts around me, tilting their heads so that their eyes, little black pearls among their feathers, can get a better look at me.\n\nI like to step back a little then, get out the treat bags, and throw a few.\n\"Treats!\" I offer in a high pitched voice.\n\nAnd without fail, a few brave crows flutter down to peck at my little offerings. It's a delight, really! Watching them hop around, gathering the little morsels. They seem so thankful, and so am I!\n\n\"Good birdies~!\" I coo, squatting down as I toss more and more food to them. It almost hurts my heart when the bags are empty and I have to announce it with a sad \"All gone! All gone!\" to my feathery friends.\n\nAt first, that was when they took off again. No doubt to bring any surplus to their families and stashes for later. It always left me feeling a bit sad and empty to be abandoned so soon.\n\nBut now, this doesn't deter them anymore. They often still hop after me a little, cawing and fluttering at me. It makes me laugh and I always answer them like it's a conversation. I like the idea that they are telling me about their day.\n\nMy favorite are a pair I like to call Huginn and Muninn. Yes, yes, those are actually ravens - so sue me.\n\nHuginn and Muninn are the bravest among their murder. They happily come so close that I could touch them if I really wanted to. I never do though - I don't know if they'd be fine with it and you know, wild animals are still wild animals. The crows and I, we appreciate each other. But I am aware that there is an invisible border between me, a human, and the wildlife of Berlin. The crows are not pets, they are not for petting.\n\nI cross the border to bring them food. And they welcome me on their side as a respectful guest. But eventually, I have a duty to leave again and return to my apartment, to the domestic world within the buildings.\n\nAnd that's okay. My love is not arrogant. I don't feel entitled to the hearts of crows.\n\nIt makes me all the more excited and happy when those two come so close, sometimes even ignoring the treats to gently caw at me. Their brethren are grey like the cloudy, misty days of autumn, safe for their black heads and wings. But Huginn and Muninn are black like the light-polluted sky at night.\n\nFor all the love I have for my surroundings, I don't have much for myself. My body, at times, feels unfitting like a suit in the wrong size. But many of my insecurities melt away when the crows look at me and I realize that in their eyes, I am no more or less unsightly than any other human. It's nice.\n\nI think the reason many people don't understand this is because to them, I'm not even remotely as social and open as I am towards the animals and plants. That's okay though. They don't need to understand as long as they are nice to me, which most of them are. I don't really have many friends, but I am treated cordially by my co-workers at the grocery store, and even by most of the customers. That's all I need. They even let me take the late shifts I prefer!\n\nMy workplace tends to be open until 11pm, which means that we typically wrap up all end-of-day stuff around midnight. So I have a whole hour of counting and tidying to get excited for my evening routine! And then I grab the treats I bought on my break and get to wander home through the nightly streets, while the city is dozing. Sometimes I take the night bus, but construction sites have a habit of popping up along my route like mushrooms. And I'm not always in the mood for the long detours or additional stops to switch busses. Especially when walking through the nightly city is so wonderful.\n\nIt never fully falls asleep, but on work nights it can get quiet enough for the cats and foxes to come out. I beam whenever I see one of them dart across a silent street in front of me, and sometimes they even stop and look at me! It's strange how in those late hours, when the world is streetlightorange and nightblack, the city feels the most alive to me. I sometimes almost think I can feel it breathe beneath my feet, its chest rising and falling ever so slowly as it dreams of faraway ambulance sirens and the occasional laughter from a dark window.\n\nSo when I walk home one autumn night and hear nothing, it gives me pause. My steps slow until I stand still, cocking my head to listen.\n\nThere is no distant rumble of cars and trains tonight. No fox screams, no cat hisses. As I raise my eyes and look around, all windows are dark, the only light around coming from the street lamps. They do not buzz as they usually do, and no moths dance around them.\n\nI shudder and pull my hoodie closer around me. But there is no wind. The trees and shrubs of my street are still, each leaf perfectly motionless. I can't help but imagine them holding their breath to escape the notice of something.\n\nWhen I hear the murder caw, it makes me wince at first. But I feel relief spreading through my chest when I see the crows flutter down onto the branches and streetlamps around me. They are familiar faces, and the suffocating isolation I felt a moment ago is easily broken by the flutter of their wings. I don't even think about the unusual time for their outing as I excitedly dig in my messenger bag and produce the little strips of meat I bought for them today.\n\n\"Treats!\" I offer, happily ripping open the bag. The rustle of the plastic feels strangely loud in the night, as does my voice. But I am too happy still - I pull out some meat bits and toss them onto the sidewalk for my friends.\n\nFor some reason, it seems to unsettle the crows. Some of them caw at me, strangely muted tonight. Huginn and Muninn flutter down to the roof of a parked car and motion at me with their wings and head. I am deeply confused that they ignore the food so completely.\n\n\"What's wrong? Treats!\" I say, throwing some more strips of meat their way. At first I smile when one of them flies off the car - but then I notice with horror that he doesn't aim for the treats on the pavement, but for me.\n\nI yelp as Muninn swishes past me so closely that I can feel his claws cut the air above my head. And I stumble back a few steps, dropping the bag and trembling as my brain tries to process the profound betrayal. I thought we were… well, not friends, maybe. Friends are a domestic thing.\n\nBut I thought I was a welcome guest. And now, instead, each caw and flutter makes me feel like I am unwanted here.\n\nI don't have much time to dwell on this, because the noise around me abruptly ceases and all bird heads turn so their beaks point at the same point somewhere above us. A discordant scratching sound is all that remains, and I feel as if someone is slowly trickling ice water down my nape as I, too, turn to face the noise.\n\nA black, needle-like limb slowly creeps around the corner of a building, on the height of the third floor just about. As it somehow finds purchase on the vertical surface, it is followed by a white face slowly emerging from behind the wall. Hair like black, tattered spiderwebbing drifts on a nonexistant breeze, long and sheer. The face looks serene, asleep, with closed eyes and a slight smile.\n\nI am frozen in place at the sight, and the gears of my mind slowly tick into position to grant me some understanding.\n\nI am at home in the domestic world. I am a welcome guest in the wild world.\n\n*This creature belongs to neither.*\n\nAbruptly, the Thing scuttles towards us. Faster than a thought, its five other limbs join the first one - all of them spindly, ending in points sharp enough to split the bricks of the building as it darts over. I can't gasp as fast as it is in front of me, and bigger than it should be. It was barely as tall as a window up on the building, but in its swift motion, perspective seemed to crack and bend, and it grew taller faster than it grew closer somehow. As the murder dissolves around me, the crows taking flight with alarmed cries, the creature stops short about two meters from me and tilts its head.\n\nFor a moment I consider running, but my instincts root me to the ground. They understand faster than the rest of me that I can't outrun something this quick - and more importantly, that running is a very prey thing to do. So I keep my breathing quiet and shallow as I slowly move my hands to my messenger bag, gripping it tightly in case I need a shield of sorts.\n\nThe creature seems to regard me through its closed eyes, its face slowly creeping closer. My brain tries and struggles to perceive its body - I can discern the spidery legs and the webbish hair, but the rest is difficult to ascertain. It's all so black that I can see it as little more than a silhouette in the night, no highlights and shadows carve out the volume for me to grasp. There is the notion that there is a neck, as it slowly elongates to bring the face closer to mine, and there is the notion that there is a body, because there must be to connect it all. But that is all I can even say with certainty, and my eyes are soon too focused on the creature's face to even pay much attention to the rest.\n\nThe face seems like a mask, perfectly expressionless except for the slightly upturned corners of the mouth. It seems made in the image of a beautiful woman at first, with full lips and a dainty nose. But as it stops so close that its nose almost touches my own, I register with horror that I am staring at my own features, without being able to pinpoint when the change took place.\n\nWe stand like this while some seconds flow by as slowly as molasses. My heart hurts as it pumps my blood so hard that the rushing in my veins rings in my ears like static, even nearly drowning out the calls of the crows above. And then my humanity emerges from the deepest depths of me, and my brain short circuits from all the stress, picking out the most mundane and unimportant thing it could possibly wonder about to suppress the fear I feel.\n\nOne of my hands slowly rises, almost without my consent, to answer the question that suddenly occupies my mind. A few trembling fingertips touch the mask in front of me, brushing against it lightly.\n\nHuh. Yeah. It's made of porcelain.\n\nThe hard china shifts in an instant from the soft smile to a wide grin and the creature's eyes snap open. Cold blue doll eyes roll around in the mask's sockets before they settle on me, and the grin widens and widens until it by all means should split the face - my face - in two.\n\nI pull back my hand and stare wide-eyed as the creature tilts its face up, up, up, never breaking eye contact with me. And then I hear a tearing, moist and horrid, and I finally look down to see that the neck is *not* moving. The mask is tearing away from it, the chin splitting and ripping open along the seams of the jaw, behind which yawns an abyss much too bottomless for even this being. I stumble back a step as it bares its teeth, which are needles and serrated blades and barbs, and a glistening rope snakes past them to split into dripping tendrils before me.\n\nSomehow I manage to hold the messenger bag up and slip out of the carrying strap just as the tentacles shoot forth and grab it, tearing it away from me and into the nightmare. A high pitched whimper squeezes from my throat when I hear a hissing sound and watch as the bountiful saliva of the monster dissolves the bag and its contents even while it gets shredded by the many teeth.\n\nIt reminds me that I have one last tool to use for such situations.\n\n\"HELP!!\" I scream. And then I remember how you're supposed to do it.\n\n\"F-FIRE! FIRE! HELP!\" I can't completely recall why, but I vaguely remember the recommendation. The fact that calling out about fire at least makes people look. Often even call 112, the firefighters and ambulance. And from the corner of my eye, I register motion in one of the dark windows around me.\n\nI allow myself to tear my gaze away from the creature long enough to see who heard me, and my eyes just meet another smiling porcelain face behind one of the window panes. My blood freezes in my veins as from the darkness behind the glass, more white faces emerge - one behind each window, un-staring at me and their ilk. I can't help but turn my head entirely to it as the first window opens and another one of the creatures crawls out, an ethereal cackle filling the air and gaining layers as more windows open up.\n\nI feel utterly hopeless and slowly turn back to the first monster. It shakes with a cackle of its own, eyes rolling in different directions. As it makes another lunge at me though, it is hit by something from above and the cackle becomes a brief, shrill shriek.\n\nMy eyes snap up to the crows. They are cawing their little souls out, but by now, that isn't all they do anymore. I see them dive down to pick up anything their claws can grasp - rocks, empty cans, sometimes even just grass or soil - and they let their burdens rain down on the monster in front of me. Some of them swoop at the other creatures, sharp beaks razing off bits of the tattered veils around their faces. My heart overflows with gratitude and fondness for them until it wells up in my eyes and streaks down my cheeks.\n\nPerhaps I can run. Perhaps I can hide. Perhaps I can return to my domestic world after all!\n\nI try to turn to make a run for my building, but before I have even finished the full spin, a searing pain shoots through me. It radiates up from my foot as I hit the ground hard. I look down to see that the creature was not too distracted to notice my attempt - it pierced my foot with one of its limbs, pinning me against the ground. I cry out as it pulls me closer even while it fends off the crows and their improvised projectiles. Around me, the limbs of other creatures scratch down the walls. I look up into the flying murder, regretting that I still don't understand what I can almost, *almost* read in the shape of their flight.\n\nAnd then, behind the creature above me… the moon blinks.\n\nI fall silent once more as something shifts. The scream of a fox tears through the night and the feet of rats skitter past us somewhere. I watch as a moth whirls through my vision and I feel the city take a deep, shuddering breath.\n\nThe moon shifts, and it is an eye, and the night turns to look at us. As it lowers its head, I can discern the shape of short, squareish ears and a broad head upon which sits a crown of red bricks. At its top, trees sprout from the wall, their leaves rustling in a wind that suddenly picked up.\n\nBerlin looks at us, fixing the creatures with her eyes, one the moon and one a pool of street- and headlights, ever shifting. I feel a rumble shaking the earth as the giant bear above us growls and the creatures turn their pale faces to it. The night parts lips of orange clouds and a fiery red tongue lolls out of the titanic maw, steel teeth bared around it. She roars, and it's the screams of foxes and the howl of car horns and the noises of catfights and the scream of train wheels against their tracks as they brake. Lost children cry in her throat, and drunk men laugh, and the teeth of creatures with glowing eyes are dipped in the same scarlet as the knives of shadowy figures.\n\nThe monsters turn to flee, but the City tears an asphalt paw out of the road and swipes at them almost lazily. Red claws the length of street blocks pierce and collect several of the spindly beings - including the one in front of me - and throw them into the gaping maw of Berlin. They shriek pathetically as she bites down and their bodies crunch, and I can't help but think they're lucky. I know that in those depths they're headed for, there are worse things than teeth and claws. I glimpsed them when the mouth was open, saw, for a moment, the things in the deep. There was the cold of the winter streets and the fear of blue lights, the hostility of benches engineered to steal your sleep, the hopelessness of letters denying your basic necessities. The helplessness of neglectful guardians, the dehumanization of a stranger screaming at you. There were the shock of driving a train when someone steps on the tracks and looking out an office window as a body drops past, followed by a chilling wet thud soon after. Horrors surely as alien to these creatures as their ropey tendrils were to me.\n\nThe murder descends onto me, still cawing madly as they land all around and on my body. Huginn and Muninn sit on my chest, staring at my face and blinking. Huginn acts as if he pecks at me first and then Muninn and the others follow suit.\n\nI weirdly understand and close my eyes, going limp and playing dead. The crows make a big show of seemingly pecking at me, tugging at my clothing here and there and spreading their wings to block the City's view of me. I feel it shift as it leans in for a sniff that lifts me off the asphalt for a heartstopping moment with its strength. But the crows immediately flutter up with a courage I will forever aspire to, offendedly cawing at the titan bear. Berlin huffs, blowing my limp body several meters down the road with the force and moves to instead pursue the creatures to which I was as easy a snack as they are to the City.\n\nI crack my eyes open a little to watch as it passes overhead, glittering with the lights of streetlamps and windows at night. The laughter and music of faraway parties brushes past me, the rustling of leaves in the night and drunk singing and meows of graveyard cats. The suffocating heat of urban summers and the chill of winter nights take turns with the mild air of springs. I hear the Spree gurgle and feel immersed in its waters, fish flitting past me, and then I feel the calm of public transport after midnight on a weekend, with tired people smiling as they head home. I smell smog and dust and excrements and blood and fresh bread rolls and flowers and wet paint and dogs.\n\nAnd then the Goddess has moved on and we are alone, the crows and I, my mind reeling from having seen and felt all my home is.\n\nIt takes Muninn actually pecking at my cheek for me to come back from my trance and I give him a bleary blink. His beak opens, but this time not to caw.\n\n\"Good birdies!\" He coos in a voice close to mine. Huginn joins in.\n\"Good birdies! Good birdies! Treats?\" They hop off my chest and their brethren get off me as well, fluttering and cawing with the occasional praise for themselves thrown in.\n\nA laugh bubbles up from deep within me, and as I throw back my head and it spills from my lips, I could swear that I can also hear the hum of cars and the rustle of leaves in it somewhere.\n\n\"Good birdies!\" I affirm and get up. It will probably be best for me to get home and sleep it off. My foot hurts, but that worldly sensation is so distant right now, while the exhaustion is so present and overwhelming.\n\nAs I limp towards my building, drawing keys from my pocket, I have to dodge wires growing up from the ground around the piece of road which Berlin's claws raked deep rifts into. I pause to watch as the broken street scabs over with a construction site. I know from the depths of my stomach that tomorrow, construction workers will show up and do their job here just as casually and naturally as everywhere else in the city. As I turn away from it, I smile about the insight I feel enlightened with.\n\nI am hurting. I am bleeding. I am freezing. I am tired.\n\nBut I am alive.\n\nJust like the city.",

        "text": "  \n\nI used to work for a trucking company. I was a dockworker, loading and unloading trailers. It wasn’t a bad job. It paid well but the shift was horrible. I mostly moved stretch-wrapped pallets, so there wasn’t too much manual labor. I had a lot of friends there and a lot of acquaintances; no one there I really didn’t get along with, except for Larry.\n\nLarry was obnoxious. He wore cowboy boots with silver tips. Just the silliest kind of footwear you could wear on the dock. He never did a damn thing and when he got called out on it, he would pout like he was being treated unfairly. I couldn’t stand the guy. The worse thing he did though was to constantly lie. It wasn’t just that he lied. It was how outrageous the lies were. He told us that he was hiking one time and found a human leg in the middle of the trail, but he didn’t bother to call the police. He said that he was a professional boxer. Everyone would ask him when his next bout was so that they could go watch him, but it always seemed to get canceled. He was the boxer that never boxed. There were many more. I thought that maybe I should start writing these whoppers down. Seemed like that there were some good plot lines and stories buried in with the insanity. \n\nWe were in the breakroom one day when I just came up with the nickname Mr. Bullshit. I didn’t even mean it. It wasn’t like I put much thought into it. I just got tired of hearing it and then I just said it. After that Larry’s life on the dock was hell. Before my christening him with his new nickname most people just went along with it. They never called him out on any of his lies, but now they not only called him out, they routinely made fun of him for all kinds of stuff, even the things not related to his lying. Them boots became a sore spot for him, a constant source of ridicule. Over time he kept to himself. He stopped talking to anyone, and then one day as we were working in a trailer together, he confronted me. \n\n“You did this to me. Everyone hates me because of you.”\n\nI responded, “What in the hell are you talking about?”\n\n“Mr. Bullshit. You started it. You said it. You made me look like an idiot and it just gets worse.”\n\n“That was a joke man. Calm down. Just messing around. You do it all the time, making fun of everyone, but when the table’s turned you can’t handle it.”\n\nHe didn’t say anything else. Shook his head and walked away. \n\nI felt bad for the guy. Dockworkers and truck drivers aren’t the most sensitive people in the world. They don’t know when to stop. They’ll push you to the limit and the more you react the more they like it. The key is just to remain calm. Of course, Larry didn’t understand that. I started helping him as much as I could. I would help him build load boxes, strap in pallets, recoup overturned skids, just whatever he needed. He never said thanks or anything, but his demeanor did change, and he was less corrosive than before. And then it happened. \n\nIt was a Wednesday, and the shift was almost over. Jason, a supervisor, handed me a bill of ten pallets. He told me to load those and go home. I was worn out, but I was ready to get out of there, so I hustled and grabbed a forklift. I was loading from one trailer to another trailer across the dock. The pallets were too tall to see around. In those cases, you’re supposed to drive backwards so you can see what’s in front of you. I didn’t do that though. There weren’t too many dockworkers around. Most of them were working in another area, getting trailers ready to go deliver in the city. I was driving forward to save time. I couldn’t see anything, but I knew I was going in the right direction, and I had looked beforehand to make sure no one was in the trailer. There were two pallets on the floor, one with some sort of tractor attachment that had a protruding sharp bar. Above those was an empty deck. A deck is just three beams and two boards. It’s like a shelf. It allows you to load more freight above the freight on the floor of the trailer. I loaded the first pallet on the left side and then went and got the second pallet. I was going to load the next one right behind the tractor attachment. I should’ve put a board up to protect the boxes on the pallet, but I was in a hurry. I hammered down on the accelerator and crashed into the trailer without any hesitation. I felt some resistance and then heard a grunt. Someone started wailing and crying for help. \n\n“Back up! You’re crushing me. Please! Please! Back the fuck up!”\n\nI panicked. My heart started pounding. What had I done. I didn’t move at all. I felt a hand grab my shirt and yank me off of the forklift. Jason had sprinted over after he heard the commotion. He backed up the forklift, put it in park, and ran into the trailer. \n\n“Holy shit. Oh my god. Hang in there man. Oh my god.” \n\nI was laying on the dock, not able to see what was happening or who I had just crushed. I got up and slowly walked around the back of the forklift and into the trailer. There in the trailer was Larry with a sharp bar thrusting through his lower abdomen. There was blood all over the trailer floor and his head was crammed up under the first bar of the deck. He looked like a marionette with its head slumped over only able to stare at his feet. The worse part was the whimpering. It was grating on my soul. He was in tremendous pain and there was no way to stop it. No one knew what to do. They didn’t know whether to move him or not, in fear that he may bleed to death. I couldn’t stand it. I walked to the break room and sat down, waiting for it all to be over, hoping that he would survive. \n\nLarry didn’t survive. He died with no friends, but I hear everyone from work went to the wake or the funeral. He had a big turnout. For once, he was the star of the show. It wasn’t the boxing match we were hoping for but at least he finally got a sympathetic audience.\n\nI quit that job. I couldn’t be on that dock again. It made me sick just driving past the place. I never could relax or stop the memory from playing in my head. It popped in my head at the most unexpected times and frequently- all the damn time. The only way I could stop it was to drink and drink heavily. I got to where I was drunk more often than I was sober. \n\nI started to see Larry. I would catch a glimpse of him out of the corner of my eye. I would turn and look quick in that direction, but no one would be there. One night I had drunk more than usual. I had binged all day. My head was swimming so I thought I would just go to bed early. I struggled to sleep but eventually my head stopped pounding enough for me to relax and dose off. At some point in the night, I felt my bed shaking. I looked up and there at the edge of the bed was a dark figure with one leg on my bed. It was tapping its foot on the mattress. There was a streetlight right outside my window. A low dull orange hue was enveloping the room and I noticed that the stranger was wearing silver tipped boots. \n\n“You’re dreaming. It’s a one-hundred and eighty proof hallucination,” I told myself. \n\nI closed my eyes and said a Hail Mary and a few Our Fathers. The shaking stopped. I opened my eyes, and nothing was there. \n\n“I’m sorry Larry. I’m so sorry. It was an accident.” I said it out loud. I hoped he heard it and accepted my apology, but I’m all too certain now that Larry did not accept my apology. He torments me to this day. He bangs around my house causing all kinds of racket. When I fall asleep, he whispers in my ear. I never remember what he says because he doesn’t enunciate well, with the gurgling of the blood and the constant choking he can’t seem to stop. He slams doors, flushes toilets, and every now and then I hear him whimper in another room. I come to blame everything on Larry. If my car breaks down, I attribute it to Larry. If I lose my keys or bang my head or stub my toe, it’s Larry. Other people say they have nothing but bad luck. I say, “here comes Mr. Bullshit again.”",

        "text": "\n\n“They put something in the water, you know.”\n\nThe man’s voice, soft and yet still shrill in my ear, had woken me from a gentle, rocking slumber.  Opening my eyes, I tried to get my bearings even as they started to water and my gorge began to rise.  Oh *God*.  What was that *taste*?  Thick and smoky and bitter, I gagged a little as I took in enough to realize I was on a city bus.  How did I get here?  And what was this man saying? \n\nI looked over at him and saw right away he was insane.  A thrill of confused fear ran through me.  He clearly expected a response, and I thought it best to play along.\n\n“The water?”\n\nHe furrowed his brow in frustration as he dug a knuckle into his left nostril with a disdainful sniff.  “Yes, *yes*, the water.  Put drugs in it to make us docile.”  He gestured at the bus passengers.  Some were asleep as I’d been, while others were staring dully out the window or into their phones, eyes searching the glass for other wheres than here.\n\nI wanted to change seats, but didn’t quite dare.  “You don’t say.”\n\nHis nostrils went red as they flared.  “I *do* say.  I *do* say.  They don’t want us thinking.  Realizing what this place is.  They just want us to blindly breathe and fuck and give in.  Eat the shit they feed us.”\n\nI was so drawn in by his strange passion that I didn’t realize the bus had come to a stop until the man jumped up into the center aisle.  Glancing around uncertainly, I realized I was actually nervous about him leaving me alone.  Leaning forward with a flush in my cheeks, I whispered to him, “Where are we?”\n\nThe man let out a shriek of laughter.  “Where are we?”  Stomping to the front of the bus, he ran down the steps and out to the sidewalk before running around the bus and up to my window.  “Where are we?”  He glanced to his right, grin widening as he rolled his eyes back to me.  “We’re in Hell.”\n\nThe truck didn’t even slow down when it hit him.  I heard the wet thudding scrape of him being drug between the wheels for a few yards before he tumbled out in a wet pile on up the road.  A few people murmured or exclaimed, but there were no real screams at first.  It was only when they saw each other that the rest of the passengers all started squawking like startled birds.  I had the thought that no one really cared.  There was no real fear or sadness, just performance for the sake of being seen or heard, or some insane impulse like a tuning fork that has been struck and now must hum along until enough time has passed to draw stillness back to it again.\n\nI didn’t scream.  I hated the sound of it all, and besides, I was distracted by what I had noticed in the seat next to me.  What my brief companion had left behind.  It was a notepad filled with tight lines of cursive that were very legible despite their small stature.  It started with:\n\n*Fourth set of notes for article*\n\n*I say fourth, though I can’t say for sure.  These fuckers keep swiping them when they can.  They want me to forget who I am and why I’m here.  Make me think I’m like these poor people they’ve got trapped here.  But I won’t. I can’t.  People have to know that this place exists.*\n\n*I think they’re pumping the stuff out in mists now.  I smell medicine smells coming through the sewer grates.  Fucking with my hed.  Got to keep it together.  I’m Peter Maywing.  I’m a freelance investigative journalist that has covered two wars, a dozen corporate cover-ups, and stood down the fucking government when they came asking for my people.  My sources.  Shit.  I need to get out of here soon.  Why hasn’t anyone gotten us out of here yet?*\n\n**** \n\n\n*I think months have passed.  Just found this notebook again.  I’d put the date or time, but I don’t know when it is.  There aren’t any clocks or calendars here, and if you ask anyone about them, they just laugh.  The only reason I remembered who I was is because Clint remembered who *he* was and came and found me.  We have to escape.*\n**** \n\nHeart pounding, I glanced around to see if anyone was looking at me.  They weren’t.  Most had sat back down, though a few were still yipping like coyotes settling down for the night.  Shuddering, I stuffed the notebook under my jacket and got off the bus.\n\nNothing looked familiar here.  Not the places or the people, or even the air, which had an odd, minty smell when the wind blew right.  Pulling my scarf up to my face, I walked along for a few minutes before finding a small diner to duck into.  I had no money in my pockets, but I did have a white card, and when I pulled it out questioningly, the waitress took it with a nod and brought it and a cup of coffee back to the table.  Once I was sure no one was paying attention, I pulled out the notebook and kept reading.\n\n*The Buddy System.  That was always our idea.  Me and Clint would go in separately, but we’d watch each other’s backs and make sure we both got out, or if shit went sideways, that at least one of us did.  But they caught on to our plan, or they always knew.  Now they just reset us periodically, like we’re computers that are acting up.  Not exactly wiping the hard drive, but it’s harder to get back the important stuff every time I wake up somewhere not knowing who or where I am.  I need to hide this somewhere safe.*\n\n**** \n\n\n*I think I’ve been reset at least twice since I last wrote in this thing.  The real me, my life and memories, why I’m here?  It’s all like I’m remembering the memory of a dream.  There are so many layers between me and the truth that everything is fuzzy.  Clint has been reset almost as much as me, but he takes it better.  He’s always been more resilient I think.  I’m really scared, and I think if they wipe me again I won’t get myself back.*\n\n*So I need to write it down right now.  Maybe for me, but probably for you, Clint.  If I see I’m not going to make it, if I can see it coming early enough, I’ll try to find you.  On a bus or at your house, or somewhere.  And I’ll leave this for you before I go.  Because I have to go, buddy.  I can’t take it in here any more.  I have to get out, one way or another.*\n\n**** \n\n\n*I am Peter Maywing.  You are Clint Thurman.  We are both writers and journalists.  You got a tip about a secret place where numerous forces around the world were shipping off their lunatics and their undesireables to live.  Not a prison or an institution, but an entire city.  A sealed world away from everything where the hidden remain so.*\n\n*They drug our food and water.  Keep us confused and docile while doing a cruel mimicry of a real human life.  It works well most of the time, but there are always episodes.  People break down and start screaming or crying.  Or hurting each other.  Or stripping off naked.  Or going on killing sprees.  But everyone is so numb that no one really pays attention to what’s wrong around them for very long.  These journals have been my intermittent lifeline, but I feel my grip slipping.  You need to get out with or without me.  Get out and tell what this place is.  It’s Hell.*\n\n**** \n\n\n*I think I’ll start drinking my piss.  I know that sounds crazy.  But I think if I drink my own fluid I’ll be more me?  Because I don’t know who Me is anymore.*\n\n**** \n\n*Piss and shit.  Shit and piss.  I only like one and the other I’d miss.*\n\n**** \n\n*I just read what I writed.  I can’t wait any longer.  I have to find you.  Give you a chance before I go bye.  Stay me long enough to warn you.*\n\n**** \n\n*I see you.  They’re loading you and four other people onto the bus.  I got you.  The Buddy System, remember?  Pissing shitters.  Taking our air.*\n\n**** \n\nThat was the last entry.  I reread it all three more times, and every time I remembered a bit more.  He was right, wasn’t he?  We were journalists.  This was an investigation.  We were going to help people and get this all shut down.  But first I had to escape.\n\nI was terrified, but maybe because of the drugs they gave us, it was all in a very detached way.  Swishing around the last of my coffee to get rid of the foulness on my tongue, I stuffed the notebook into my jacket and headed out onto the street.\n\nThe card was some kind of debit card I guessed.  I was able to take taxis all over the city that afternoon.  I didn’t know who was a patient and who was a guard, so I had to give vague directions, but my real intention was to see the edges of the city.  How far did it go and what was the security like there?  If it was made by humans it was flawed, and I could find some mistake to exploit if I was smart and patient.\n\nOr so I thought.  But everywhere I went, there were just roads that ended in walls, not of stone or concrete, but of glass.  Black, featureless glass that went up as high as I could see.  How was that even possible?  How could you build something like that and have it not blow over or collapse under its own weight?\n\nMy stomach was churning as I hailed my fourth taxi.  Evening was creeping in now and the light would be gone soon, but I still had South left.  Maybe that’s where everything came and went.  It took me a few minutes to realize that instead of taking me that way, the driver was headed to the heart of the City.\n\n“Um, I think you’re turned around.  I said I wanted to go to the southern edge of the City.”\n\nThe man behind the glass chuckled.  “Oh, I heard you.  But the radio man said take you to the Station, so to the Station you go.”\n\nHeart pounding, I leaned forward.  “What?  Who’s the radio man?”\n\nAnother chuckle.  “The man on the radio, of course.”\n\nI slammed a fist into the thick pane between us.  “Goddamn it.  What’s the Station then?”\n\nHis eyes were yellowed and cruel when he found mine in the mirror.  “It’s where they correct you.”\n\n**** \n\nThey pulled me from the taxi easily, using just enough force to get me to comply, no more or less.  I’d been driven to an underground garage beneath a huge monolithic building I couldn’t recall in my spotty memory.  Had it always been there, or had it raised up like a dragon’s head when it caught my scent?\n\nWhat the fuck was wrong with me.  I needed to stay sane and find a way out of this.\n\nThey drug me through several floors and twisting corridors before strapping me down to a chair in a black chamber lined with tapestries of some kind.  Looking closer, I started to retch.  They weren’t tapestries.  They were the skins of people—whole skins, flayed from their bodies, stretched and dried before being hung on display.  Trembling, I felt my bowels loosen slightly as a woman walked in from the far end of the room and made her way to me.\n\n“Hello, Tony.”\n\nI swallowed.  “My name…My name isn’t Tony.  It’s Clint.  I-I’m Clinton Thurman.  I know who I am.”\n\nPulling up a chair from outside of my vision, she clucked her tongue as she studied me with a concerned look on her face.  “Oh, Tony.  Not this again.”  She shook her head and let out a small sigh.  “I don’t blame you.  I don’t.  I honestly want to blame Peter, but he wasn’t well either was he?  And my mother always said you don’t speak ill of the dead.”  Leaning forward, she put a cool hand on my forehead.  “But he is the one that always inflamed your delusions, wasn’t he?  What was it this time?  You were spies?  On a t.v. show?  What?”\n\nI blinked, feeling tears in the corners of my eyes.  “We…we’re reporters.”\n\nShe lifted her eyebrows.  “Ah, that one.  So you’re reporters.  What’re you reporting on?  The weather?”\n\nFrowning at her, I shook my head.  “I’m not telling you anything.”\n\nThe woman smiled at me.  “That’s fine, Tony.  I don’t need you to.  I’ll tell *you*.  According to Peter, you’re both investigative journalists, right?  Here to expose the City as some cruel prison where the dark forces of the world hide their unmentionables? Is that about right?”\n\nI felt a tear sliding down my cheek as I stared at her.  “I am not crazy.”\n\nHer smile fell away, replaced by a look of sadness.  “Honey, yes you are.  I know some people don’t like using that word, but of *course* you are.  You have delusions and hallucinations.  We’ve been in this very room so many times and you’ve said it looked like a spaceship, the inside of a tree, and those are just the pleasant ones.  Your insanity lends itself to very macabre and paranoid flights of fancy.”\n\nIt felt hard to breathe now, and it took a couple of tries before I got my next question out.  “So this place isn’t a city of crazy people?”\n\nShe patted my knee.  “It is, but not in a bad way.  This is a very exclusive, very expensive institution for those that have families that can afford to have their loved ones treated and kept in an environment that is minimally restrictive while giving them the treatment they need.  They can live full lives without feeling isolated or stigmatized, and in some cases they can even be reintegrated into society down the line if they make enough progress.”  She clucked her tongue again.  “Progress that you seemed to be making before Peter got his hooks into you again.  Shame on him.”  The woman waggled her fingers in the air.  “I mean it, I know he’s dead, but shame on him.”\n\nMy head was swimming, but I tried to focus on one thing she’d said.  “I…I can get out?”\n\nPursing her lips, she gave a small nod.  “Maybe.  Some day.  I hope so.  But I won’t lie to you.  This latest episode has set you back considerably.  We need to do a reset again, which I really hate because we just did one.”\n\n“A reset?”\n\nStanding up, she pushed the chair back as she nodded again.  “Yes, I don’t like doing them in quick succession, but I feel like getting this all out of the way now is better than letting it fester.  Give you a clean start on the right track.  How does that sound?”\n\nI was sobbing now, terrified and grateful and ashamed.  I sucked in a deep breath, the mint burning my lungs as it went down.  “Yes, yes.  Anything you say.”\n\nHer smile was back now.  “Very good.”  Clapping her hands, she stepped further to the side as the two men who had brought me there carried in a thick plastic tarp and unrolled it on the floor before my chair.  Once it was attached to hooks and firmly in place, she told them to “Bring him in.”  They left quickly, heading behind me, and several minutes passed in silence as we waited.  I wanted to ask a million questions, but I was so confused now and I worried that if I made problems I would only make things worse for myself.  So I stayed quiet until some door opened behind us and I gave a startled coyote yelp.\n\nI could smell it before I saw it.  A ponderous pale mound of flesh three times the size of a normal man, rolls of fat dry and white and flaking on top and oozing clear and crimson lines from whatever raw rot lay underneath those folds.  It had a head, but I only glimpsed its shape briefly as it was wheeled around and positioned so its stirruped legs were over the clear plastic tarp.  Fighting back the urge to vomit, I looked over at the woman questioningly and whispered.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nShe hit a button on the wall and all my straps unlocked and pulled away.  I would have stood up then, but her angry gaze had me pinned to the spot.\n\n“He is our god.  And you will kneel to him.  Now.”\n\nShaking uncontrollably, I pitched myself forward onto the tarp.  How could any of this be real?  It had to be more delusions.  Was I really this far g…\n\nDark matter began to curl out of the shadowy, fetid place between his legs, plopping wetly to the tarp with an explosion of new corrupted scents that made my eyes burn.  A second piece, and then a third, a fourth, and then no more.  All the time, I was frozen on my knees, too afraid and disgusted to move or speak.\n\nI heard the woman step closer now as she put a cold hand on my neck.  “This is the reset process.  One of the many gifts he gives us.  This will put you back on the right path.  Get rid of these delusions once and for all.”\n\n“I…oh God…ah…what do I have to do?”\n\nShe snorted lightly.  “Isn’t it obvious?”  When I didn’t respond, she pushed my head forward gently.  “Eat it.  All of it.  Eat it all right up.”\n\n****  \n\n“Can I get some water please?  My mouth tastes bad.”\n\nThe lady smiled at me.  “You can when you get finished writing it all down.   Everything you remember.”\n\nI held up the laptop like a child who had finished an unsavory meal.  “I did already.”\n\nHer smile fell away.  “Don’t be pert.  You didn’t write this part did you?  Keep going.”\n\n“Oh.  Sorry.  Okay.”  I paused, and then, “Why are you having me write all this?  You told me it didn’t really happen.”\n\n“No, I said that it didn’t matter that it happened.  That no one will believe it.  Especially if we tell it to them like its real.  People are mistrustful of the truth when they want a lie.”\n\nI nodded as though I understood, though I didn’t at all.  “So what will you do with what I’m writing?”\n\nShe shrugged.  “Leak it onto the internet maybe.  I might post it on a forum.  Nosleep maybe.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\nShe licked her thumb and rubbed something thick and gummy off my cheek before popping it back in her mouth.  Sucking on it, she closed her eyes with a contented sigh.  “I think that’s enough, Clint.”\n\n“You said my name was Tony.”\n\n“Did I?  Well I told you there was a world outside of here too, didn’t I?”\n\nI felt fear welling up in me again.  “You did.”\n\n[She giggled, her eyes hard as little chips of glass.  “I can’t believe you believed me.”](https://redd.it/10ra0bz)",

        "text": " I dreamt a dream of the world ending in late November, 1878, in a hidden town nestled in the Colorado mountains, called Oatsin Sparrow. \n\nI dreamt of the man who unknowingly made it happen. I lived his life; saw into his dark heart of longing and grit and despair. \n\nIt's all too real, and for days now, not a single bit of it has left me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a crazy thought, but it's almost as if this really happened in another *when*,  somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is his story.  This is my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Faceless Indian\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe killer’s dark eyes burned through the campfire at the apparition. \n\nThe silhouette of its-*his* war bonnet, feathers lining his back that waivered in slight fashion from the cool October breeze as his phantasmal silhouette glistened in the moonlight near the river’s edge. The stallion he sat upon was motionless as was the Indian, Never giving any outward indication it noticed Orin’s presence, other than its refusal to leave his line of sight at any moment.\n\nSometimes it was as far out as the horizon line, barely visible in the naked, burning sun. Sometimes he would wake and it stood just feet from him, facing a seemingly random direction—always on his enormous horse. Always motionless. \n\nThe first time he saw it was the morning after a particularly bloody raid earlier that August in Southwestern Montana. He’d woken up to piss before dawn and almost bumped into the broadside of its horse as soon as he walked outside of his tent at Fort Shaw. He fell to his feet and let out a startled “Argh,” but the soldiers on watch didn’t hear him. He’d thought the Nez Perce had come to exact their revenge. The closest weapon within arm’s reach of the inside flap of the tent was his homemade bowie knife — a brutal and painful-looking piece of tempered steel he’d named Mammon— and he’d drawn it as he scrambled to his feet to make some clumsy attempt to defend himself. He slashed at its thigh and it blinked away without making a sound. He looked around, eyes bulging and confused. Then he saw it; it had moved about thirty feet away near out in the open pasture, and just stood there in the dawn light. \n\nThat was when he noticed it had no face. \n\nSix hundred or so miles later, there they were; along Green River in eastern Utah territory. The Indian had never left him since. Not after he deserted the other men to catch what he believed at the time to be his fleeting sanity. Not after passing through all those towns filled with loose women and whiskey and severed arteries. Not after cutting the lives of two spirited boys to an abrupt end, for no other reason than having the misfortune of prodding a rattlesnake posing as a man. So, there he sat. Sharpening his crude weapon with which he’d inflicted so much pain throughout the years, and oiling his guns, for who knew what danger awaited around the corner for Orin Black to take part in. It always seemed to find him, and he always welcomed it. \n\nHe finished his dehydrated meat and drank from his canteen, eyes never leaving the enigma. \n\nAfter a long pause with no sound but the burbling river and the cracking fire, he spoke out to the Faceless Indian, “We’re getting closer, aren’t we...”\n\n*Silence*\n\n“Yeah, we are... I can feel it.” and he could. He couldn’t place how or why he knew it, but he could sense they were drawing nearer to wherever it was taking him. In the beginning, it took six days to figure out whether he was following it, or it was following him, but it always had a gentle push Southeast, and now cutting hard East towards Colorado according to his map.\n\nThis *pilgrimage* he was on was leading him to something sinister, of that he was certain. That was okay though. Ever since he gunned down that first lone Nez Perce man on the way to Big Hole .. on that fateful night, his dark shepherd took the lead to his destiny and he was along for the journey. He remembered watching the man’s death rattle in the reeds and the bulging eyes that looked right into his as he stared down at the man from his mount. Although that wasn’t the first time he’d killed. No, there had been seven others up until then. But that man, that man somehow felt like he was an omen of senseless slaughter to come,  the type that attached itself to his soul and never lets go, and he had been right so far. Wherever he was going, he was fascinated, horrified, and utterly obsessed with the thing The Ghost of the Plains he liked to call him to himself. \n\nOrin ate the last bits of dried fruit he’d bought from Salt Lake a while back, and went to sleep under the stars. \n\nWhen he awoke, it was brustled up beside Pepper, his dapple grey mare. She sniffed the emaciated stallion the Indian sat upon, and the otherworldly horse gave the slightest of nods toward her. Pepper didn’t rear or buck or do any of the other hierarchical things horses do when they came into contact with one another.\n\nOrin got up and stomped what was left of the smoldering embers, placed his tinder box in his bedroll and rolled it, and put them in his mare’s saddlebags. He hopped up on her and presented an outstretched arm to the Indian— the universal gesture to *lead the way,* but specters didn’t abide by the behest of mortals. He commanded Pepper forward and she shouldered into them— a lazy attempt to get it \\*blink\\* along whatever path it was leading him. It didn’t work. The black steed just kept its balance, staggering its legs carelessly as he pushed into it. \n\nHe knew all he had to do was put his hand out to touch it, and it would move. The whole course of action was more out of boredom than anything else. He hopped off of Pepper, grabbed a rock about the size of a silver dollar, and threw it at the unnaturally thin faceless Indian. It made a dampened *Thud*, bounced off the smooth skin where his nose should have been, and tumbled to the ground. No reaction. Orin extended his index finger and moved it in slowly to the Indian horse’s hindquarter, and then it was gone from his immediate vicinity. he looked East, across the river and there it was 500 yards or so ahead of him. It seemed to move on its own more or after the first push. It just needed a little bit of a nudge at first light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd they went on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree more days of following ensued, until a tinged orange canyon and natural bridges made out of sedimentary jutted overhead in awe-inspiring arches. The silhouette of the Indian and his stallion stood atop one of the natural rock bridges against the setting sun. It *wanted* him here, as it had wanted him at all of those other stops along the way. \n\n*But why did he listen?* He’d been led to inescapable ultraviolence at every respite dingetown, and this place was sure to be no different. He could just as easily turn and head to a small haven where no one knew his name or what he’d done down in Mexico, away from all of the horrors he’d committed. But it would still be there, wouldn’t it? Taunting him. Reminding him that he was a violent man when it called for it, and the call often found him.\n\nAt least all of the bastards had it coming. \n\nHe and Pepper pressed on into the canyon, into the setting sun, and hitched up at the nearest saloon. He restocked on hard biscuits, dried meat, and beans at the local general goods store. He was due for a drink, a shave, and a hot bath. There were a few whores scurrying around and some gentlemen— if you can call them that—with a rather inebriated disposition, stumbling out of the swinging doors that poured life and sound into the dirt street as they opened. The Piano music played from inside and deep, and bellied laughter rumbled from someone that has had dulled all of their reserved notions about two hours ago. A washed-up whore walked right past the Faceless Indian— now tucked away in-between two buildings in the shadows— and didn’t give the most casual of glances at him. In fact, her hat blew off right near the stallion’s front hooves and she bent over near them to grab it, almost subconsciously not looking at them. and most definitely avoiding them. It was always this way when it was near others. The people seemed to do everything in their power not to look directly at it and didn’t even seem to notice its presence. Orin snapped back into focus and walked on.\n\nHe entered and ingested the place. Vagabonds, outlaws, and drunkards inhabited the dingy, warm piss smelling saloon. He understood why, too. It was completely cut away from the world— a perfect place for a tainted man to hide away. One of them was sure to give him some kind of shit, and he’d have to put a hole in him one way or another, but that wasn’t concerning him now. Now, he just wanted to drink. \n\nHe sat on the stool at the bar and an oddly prim and groomed bartender moved to him while cleaning a glass with a rag. His eyes deadened when as they scanned and took Orin in. Orin had a striking handsomeness about him; with high cheekbones, and a squared jaw. His hair was sandy blonde and long as was his beard, but his eyes were deep-set, dark, and wild; his face hard. A deep scar kissed the bridge of his nose and split his right eyebrow in two, trailing up the side of his head only added to his image. His rippled with sinew and his hands were veined and powerful, as was his neck. To some, he may have looked like a man who commanded respect; a man who you listened to when he told a tale of a battle in a distant savage land (although tale-telling wasn’t one of his strong suits), but to the bartender, he looked like a quarrelsome dead ringer for trouble. \n\nThe Drifter threw two bits on the counter, “Whiskey. And one of those cigars in that box over there,” he gave a faint nod at the cigar box behind the bartender. The bartender, straight-faced but amenable, poured first and then turned around to grab the cigar and the silver cigar cutter next to it. Orin Downed the whiskey in a quick \\*gulp\\* without grimacing. \n\n“What brings you to Moab, fella?” the bartender asked. “Passing through?”. Orin just nodded and then glanced out the window the faceless Indian had been peering intently inside since he stepped foot in the building. His gaze reverted after the sharp \\*snip\\* of the cutter clipping the cigar; the waiter handed it to him. \n\n“Quite the curious place— this little town full of men with suspicious dispositions. Never seen a place tucked away in the rocks quite like it.” \n\nThe bartender lit a match and held it to Orin’s cigar. “That it is. I suppose it’s off the beaten path enough. Not much calvary, bounty hunters nor Indians coming through here (or so he thought), and Sherif O’drury over yonder is playing cards with two men known to be wanted for stealing cattle,” The bartender said. \n\n“How do you know I’m not the calvary, or a bounty hunter or hell why not both?” Orin gave a faint and crooked smile without showing any teeth. \n\n“Bounty hunter— maybe” The oily bartender shrugged. “but I don’t believe you’d step out of this place without being greeted by the good Lord if you were so inclined to conduct business in here. The Coyote is off-limits in Moab. Besides, I don’t reckon you’re here for any of these fellas even if you were. Your eyes look the runnin’ type rather than the chasin’.” The bartender poured Orin another whiskey that he subsequently gulped down as though he was chasing away an unpleasant truth, and then signaled another. \n\nHe then turned back to the open window the Faceless Indian had been staring in from.\n\n“...maybe a bit of both,” he said softly.\n\nThe Indian was shifting in the wind— its form, along with the steed (although he believed them to be one and the same) both seemed to have lost their inner bones and mass, much like a rattlesnake’s shed skin that had been dropped in a pool of water. It folded itself in and began to squeeze its way through the window with ethereal grace. It flooded in in an elongated mass, past the Sherriff and the other poker players— they didn’t seem to notice. \n\nIt moved behind the bartender and hovered over him in an enormous, tangled mass. \n\nOrin had been staring at it. The bartender gave him an inquisitive look. “You okay, mister?” \n\nIt was a distant muffle to Orin. He knew what the entity’s hovering meant. This man had done something unspeakable. *Looks like there won’t be time for a bath and a shave here, after all,* he thought. The Steed’s head unfolded enough to form and look at the Bartender from behind him— its dead, white eyes staring down at the back of his head. Its mouth opened slowly and got close to the greasy strand of hair that he utilized his combover, and then exhaled through its nostrils. \n\nThe bartender felt the gust and jumped around, startled. “By Jesus!” He exclaimed. The tangled mess of entity retreated up above him out of his sight. The bartender looked around for anyone who may have been blowing in his ear. “What the fuck was that?!” \n\nOrin just stared at him. “So in this respite for low men, what brought you here...” Orin’s eyes were fixated on the man. The bartender, still puzzled about the matter of the phantom draft what little remained of the hair on the top of his head, gave an apathetic, “Don’t all men have things they’d rather leave behind...” The Bartender distracted himself with a thought that gave him shame, or sadness, or regret, or none of those things. Orin could read it on his face. “Some more than others.” He downed his last whiskey and then got stood up to leave. \n\nThe Drifter didn’t care what the oily bartender had done. Orin had a bag of scalps himself in a patch knotted to his belt. He simply wanted to wash, and sleep. The Faceless Indian brought him to violence; used him. That, he knew at this point. Every stop in town ended the same way. The Faceless Indian lead him to one of the *Darkened — as* he liked to think of them— men who’d done unspeakable things. Most town visits ended in bloodshed. And every time he lost a piece of himself. *But every now and then, he’d get to rest.* \n\nHe turned and began to walk toward the entrance, and he felt a gust whoosh the side of his head, and a subsequent Crash\\* of glass explode against the doorframe. \n\nThe man playing the parlor music stopped, and everyone froze silent. \n\nOrin let out a defeated sigh without turning around, lowered his head for a moment, and then turned around to confront the bartender. \n\nThe bartender’s eyes were pink, bulging, and wild. “What difference does it make to you what I done?!” His voice was quivering with rage. a voice from the poker table spoke out to the bartender \n\n“Pete, what’s gotten into yo—” \n\n“Shut your fucking mouth and sit back on that stool” Orin boomed at him, his eyes never leaving the man he now knew as \\*Pete\\*. The voice stilled, and he heard of the stool creak from a rear end re-acquainting itself with its pad. \n\n“I just wanted a night’s rest in a bed and a shave” Orin muttered to himself as he exhaled through his nostrils. The floating, whisping skin of the entity had fully disappeared now. It had made its mark on the man, filled him with the pink mist of rage, and he wasn’t going to walk out of here alive. \n\nDeep down Orin knew this but hadn’t quite let go of the notion of hot water on his skin.\n\n“Pete... I don’t care what you’ve done. I’m just passing through and wanted a night’s rest before I moved on.” Orin knew at this point the spell the entity placed on these low men. It was almost as if it sparked the madness and rage of a bull, and directed it at Orin, so he could cut them down. \n\n“These fine folks would understand if you just washed up and called it an evening, and got back to it in the morning. Why don’t you pour yourself some of your nicest brandy and go sit out under the stars for a while, Pete.” Orin’s voice was calm and smooth, but direct. His eyes wide and wild; his brain telling them to peel the lids away as far as possible to assess any threat in the form of another bottle, or even hot lead that might abruptly come his way. \n\nOrin was well aware that, being a bartender, he would likely have to cut down at least a couple of others if, and when \\*Pete got any notions about him.\n\nThe bartender groaned at him in delirious anguish, clawing the side of his head until blood began to trail down the side of his cheek. The other hand, heavily tremored, drew closer to the pistol on his hip until the tip of the index finger toughed the dark steel “aahee.. she was just a little nig-” \n\nCRAK!\n\nOrin had heard enough. Orin sent a colt .45 round right through his left cheek and it made a colorful display of red rain and chunks of pink all over the bottles of spirits behind him. Pete fell, and the rest of his blood began to flow out of him— pressure pulsing with his heart while mindless “eehhhhhhh”s thronged from his vocal cords as his lungs pumped frenzied air.\n\nThe Drifter another five rounds into three more men to his left as they dried to draw on him… the first three rounds piercing the first man and entering the second, the fourth round to blow the jaw off the third who was behind him. and the last to stop the screaming of the man Orin had shot behind the first. It was all in such a lightning blur, everyone else was stunned in silence. A moment later, a woman in the corner screamed. \n\nA massive, heavyset man that had been sitting at the poker table realized at some point that Orin had spent all of his rounds and grabbed him by the throat. He was at least four inches taller than The Drifter, and a good fifty pounds heavier. The man yanked Orin over to the wall and wrapped his sausage fingers tight around his throat. Orin clambered for a finger to break. With no luck, He took the heel of his boot and scraped it down the man’s shin with as much force as he could exert—which was considerable. the man reared his leg back but still maintained his grip. Another local got out of his chair to help subdue The Drifter, but as he ran up to their side, intestines fell to the floor. \n\nThe second man that had reached for Orin stammered back, hands to his stomach in shock. Orin had his awful-looking blade in his hand, the name Mammon cursive-engraved into the side of the blade and now dripping crimson. \n\nOrin then stuck the tip into the side of the big man’s temple. As he fell to the ground, he hammered it in deeper and deeper until the involuntary twitching started— the nervous system giving its last hurrah. \n\nOrin stood up using the still twitching body as something to prop himself with and began reloading his spent Colt 45 mindlessly as he breathed labored breaths. His hands still shook with adrenaline. \n\n“Don’t worry, the show’s over unless anyone else cares to partake,” he said. He peered over at the Sheriff, who looked down at the floor as Orin’s gaze met his, hands still up in the air. Orin marked him a coward and continued scanning the room for anyone else who might be a threat. None seemed to have remained.\n\nHe went behind the bar and grabbed a few bottles of rye, and some top-shelf bourbon and put them all into his nap sack, and left The Coyote. His work was done here. He walked outside of the Saloon and the Faceless Indian stood ahead on its steed toward the end of town, satisfied and ready to press onward. It looked at Orin with the face of his Son yet again, and they moved on.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo Be Continued...",

        "text": "My mother always made me play hide and seek with her. It was just her and me, and we played at nine. \n\nEach time, without failure, she told me to ignore her during the game. She told me that she would purposefully try to trick me, but, you know, if you really wanted to trick somebody, why tell them anything? \n\nWe played in the park. I thought this was normal. I knew other families didn't do this, but at the same time, I thought there was nothing wrong with us doing it. I liked the park afterall. During the night the air was so fresh, and it was silent, and the trees seemed larger than usual.\n\nShe counted down from one hundred, giving me ample time to run away. My general competetiveness, always made me run away and as far away as I could. I'd find some space behind many trees, and I'd lie down.\n\nThe park was large, but somehow my mother would always manage to walk past me at least three times in those twenty minutes. I'd always hear her speaking as she walked past me. *Come out Clara. Clara please come out. I'm sick of this stupid game Clara, it's cold and I just want to go home.* \n\nI ignored her. When we first started with the games, I'd been foolish enough to leave my hiding spot. My mother's face immediatelly turned into one of fury. She'd walk up and grab me tightly by the shoulder as she scolded me relentlessly. *I told you not to listen to me! Didn't I!* She would drag me back to the car, and ignore me until the next day, when we played.\n\nI didn't know why she did it. After I'd stopped listening to her during the twenty minutes of game time, it would no longer trick me. I knew she was lying, and it simply seemed like a waste of breath and energy to keep calling out for me. \n\nShe got angry when she found me to. The park was a huge place, and if she hid somewhere I would never find her, but somehow my mother was excellent at tracking me down. It was like she sniffed me, and hunted me down.\n\nInstead of getting angry at me, she got dessipointed. She'd sigh loudly, and her eyes would tear up, before she'd dejectedly walk to the car. That gave me the worst feeling ever, filling me with inadequacy. One time, she found me after only two minutes, and she broke down sobbing. I didn't get it.\n\nI felt a huge urge to win. I needed it, so I started to get creative. I hid myself in the bushes. I'd change my clothing to be more green and black and generrally more inconspicous. I got high up in trees, so it would be difficult to see me from the ground. I learned how to stay still, really, really, still.\n\nAnd when I won, my mother would give me a smile. It wasn't a smile of happiness, or a smile of pleasure. It was more a relieved smile, but I felt so proud when I saw it. We'd go home, and I'd have an easy time falling asleep. \n\nThen my father came. \n\nOne day, when I came back from school, I saw him talking to my mother. He was almost never home, actually, I'd seen him twice in my entire life, and my mother never really spoke about him. He was really just a stranger to me.\n\nI noticed the expression on my mother's face immediately. It was pale, white, shaking, eyes wide. I couldn't hear what he was saying, so I got closer in towards them. Of course, their conversation stopped just as I did it.\n\nWell my father stopped speaking, the expression on my mother stayed the same. He turned to me and smiled in a wolfish way. It made me recoil away with disgust. He sneered. *He fucking sneered.* I thought it was normal, that was how my classmates acted afterall. \n\nLater that same day, when my father was off in the toilet, my mother got close to me a whispered. \"Don't come out. Not even after twenty minutes\n\nMy father got really energetic right before bed time. I thought we'd skip the whole hide and seek thing. My mom looked really sick, and looking at the clock, she said, \"Let's take a trip to the park.\"\n\nI immediately noticed that she didn't mention hide and seek. \n\n\"Why?\" My father asked.\n\n\"Why not, get some fresh air maybe.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"I like em active anyway.\"\n\n*What the hell did he mean by that?* \n\nMom told me to change with a certain look, and I caught what she meant immediately. *Put on hiding clothes.* After doing it, we got into th car and we drove to the park. My mother was silent the entire way but my father hummed.\n\nWe walked together in the park for a while, my dad mumbling about work. I don't remember much of it. Honestly, it didn't sound like any job I'd ever heard. Then, suddenly my mother pointed at a tree in the distance. I noticed that it was the same tree she'd found me hiding behind the last time she'd caught me. \"These trees get so old. Then, they die. It's a shame they're stuck in place, unable to get away from the virus.\"\n\nShe was saying, *get away and hide.* \n\n\"Death is the way of all living things,\" dad said. \"No need to fear it.\"\n\n\"I think I saw a squirrel in that tree,\" I said. \"I'm going to go check it out.\"\n\nI dissapeared into the forest, I'd grown well aquainted to. I got behind a hill, before changing direction and moving away. I made sure to try to move on the spots that wouldn't leave a mark. I needed to get far away before they noticed something was up. \n\nI thought about climbing a tree and hiding there, or, about diving into a couple of bushes. Trees were only effective if people didn't check. Bushes worked great, but, you'd have a small, if no, view of your surroundings. I chose the bushes, jumping into them, and trying to control my breath.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, I heard my parents walking in the distance. \n\n\"Clara,\" Dad shouted. \"Where are you sweetheart? If you're hurt please say something and we'll help.\"\n\n\"Clara!\" Mother said. \"Clara can you hear me darling?\"\n\nMy heart beat faster. I knew for a fact that I shouldn't leave the bushes. That was the absolute worst thing that could happen. I kept me breathing under check as they moved further and further away from me.\n\nThen, they came back. \n\n\"Please Clara, *your dad isn't dangerous,* please come out.\"\n\n\"Clara, please, I need to get going soon, please come out.\"\n\n\"Clara,\" mom said. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Stop this silly nonsense,\" Dad said. \n\nTheir voices eventually faded out. I stayed there, in the same position, for nearly a whole hour. My body started to ache, and I could feel insect crawling around on the back of my leg. I really wanted to leave this position.\n\nI heard a stick snap in the distance. It came from behind me. I hadn't heard their voices at all, had they just stopped speaking. That terrified me, and I felt I needed to turn around and get a view, but I knew that would give me away.\n\n\"Clara stop with this *silly nonsense,* come out.\"\n\nI was entirely silent.\n\n\"Clara please come out.\"\n\nHer voice was turning more and more desperate. More guttural. Fortunatley, it was what semeed to be around seventy meters away from me. But she was appraoching.\n\n\"Clara,\" Mom said. \"I'm getting tired. I just want to go home *eat,* and sleep.\"\n\nI stayed silent as the voice grew louder. She was approaching me. \n\n\"I know you're in the area. It's only a moment of time before I find you. I will skin you, *haha*.\"\n\n\"I'll start with your forearms, peeling off your skin with a dull knife, just like peeling back cheese. I wager there'll be lots of blood coming out. And screaming. I won't be able to focus, but that's alright. I can always switch to your other arm.\" \n\nShe came closer.\n\n\"You won't like it. I certainly wouldn't, but I'm not as stupid and fucking disgusting as you are Clara. No. I'm glad I'm not a creature of filth like you. The only good you can serve is by being in my belly. By fueling me.\"\n\n\"I'll find you.\"\n\nThe voice was only twenty meters away.\n\n\"You'll regret not coming out.\"\n\nTen meters.\n\n\"You know, I don't eat the bones. They get stuck in my throat, but I can't leave them. I'll probably take take them home with me, and suck on them. They have a good taste you know. It'll be perfect.\"\n\nTwo meters.\n\nShe giggled. *Did she find me? Oh no.* I debated whether I should stay still and hope for the best or if I should look back. My fear was killing me, and it had to know, but I know looking would make noise. No. I had to stay still. \n\n\"I know where you are,\" she said.\n\n*Fuck.* \n\nBut then, she began walking away from my spot. \n\n\"I'll suck on your eyeballs before swallowing them. Their better whole, and they're always wet and squishy so they go down the throat easily. If not, there's always blood. Oh a mouth full of warm blood. Is there a better feeling?\"\n\nI stayed still for that entire night, even after I was certain that they'd gone away. It was only when the sun was above me, and I could hear other children, that I stood up. One child jumped back and shrieked. He must have gotten properly terrified.\n\nThen, I made my way back home. \n\nDad wasn't there, but mom was. She hugged me.",

        "text": "During the winter of 2019, I suffered from an intense bout of depression. This is on the whole nothing new for me, but the severity of this particular low season remains to this day the bleakest point in my entire life. I did nothing but work and drink. Long night shifts, from eight in the evening til eight in the morning, chased with cheap rot gut vodka. The kind that you could find for under ten dollars in a plastic bottle with cheap graphics of Russian towers adorning the front. I can say for certain though, that neither an overworked mind, nor an oversaturated liver caused me to dream up this particular evening. I can still recall the exact details with stark, harrowing clarity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time, I was living alone in a studio apartment in the pacific northwest. I had previously shared this apartment with my girlfriend Andrea. She knew about my tendency towards excess with drinking before we lived together, and had always disapproved when I would get too drunk. I made promises to clean up my act when we lived together. But I didn't. If anything, it just escalated. We were short-staffed at my job, and I wasn't handling all of the extra responsibilities well. I told myself I was working hard to rise up in the company and pay for a house for us. That this was just the price I had to pay now for domestic bliss later. We held out for about four months, but I had nested deeply into a hole where all I did was work, drink and fill my time with errands and walks in an attempt to stave off the growing discomfort in my mind. Truth be told, I think she was suspicious of me to some degree. That I was cheating or doing drugs or something. I had nothing to hide, but my erratic alcoholic behavior and tendency towards secrecy during times of poor mental health kept me at a distance from everyone, especially those I loved most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Andrea had enough one day, and after a particularily unpleasant exchange of words, I came home from a Wednesday night shift to find my apartment empty. Once full of her colorful art and furniture, it had been reduced to a functional, bare box that became a physical reflection of the sick den of seclusion that I had found myself mentally and spiritually confined to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this, I began to escalate my alcoholism in earnest. I would regularly drink a liter a night, at a pace that would put a more casual drinker in the hospital. At the time I latched onto this with some sort of twisted pride. I was a goddamn viking. If I had opened up my home and life to my family, their hearts would have broken at the sight. As it was however, they were 3000 miles away on the other side of the country. As long as I made regular update posts on facebook and called every now and then, they didn't question it too much, not even when Andrea left seemingly out of the blue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worked six out of seven nights a week, picking up hours where I could get them in an effort to keep myself occupied. I would have consecutive shifts unending, but I needed at least one night a week for my *real* binge. I would load up at the liquor store in the morning after work, drink myself into a stupor all day until I passed out and wake up in the evening. If it was early enough, I would head to the liquor store again, or the grocery store if that were closed. If it was too late in the evening for the sale of alcoholic beverages, I would still get restless and go down to one of the nearby gas stations. There were 3 within walking distance that were open 24/7. A smoke in the cool night air, a sandwich and some chips, and of course a few swigs from my flask were enough to breathe new life into my pounding head and trembling limbs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, I was a fucking wreck. I was burning through days, weeks, months and I didn't have a single plan, care or goal. I guess I was just trying in my own fucked up way, to survive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thursday night off, I woke up later than usual. I had hit it pretty hard that morning, and I was paying the toll with a parched throat and a heaving stomache. Downing the glass of water by my bedside, I looked through the stack of library rented DVD's on my night-stand. I figured I would go for a walk, have a smoke, get some pedialyte and a sandwich from the gas station and come home and watch *Demolition Man*. Reaching under my bed, I pulled out my vodka, took a large swallow and topped off my flask. I got up from the bed with an aching groan, grabbed my keys, phone and wallet and went out into the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a podcast playing through my headphones, a cigarette between my fingers, and the taste of one hundred proof vodka washing back the bile in my throat, I felt a certain sense of...not quite peace. I don't believe I had the ability to feel content during that period of my life. But my mind and my body began to approach a place of neutrality. A state of blankness. It was the closest I was going to get to zen. I didn't have to think about the mistakes I'd made, the regrets I had with Andrea, the poor life choices and stagnant pool of depression I willingly immersed myself in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind was off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy guard was down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy senses were dull.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven still, I noticed the man falling in step behind me. He turned onto the sidewalk from the doorway of an apartment. I didn't think much of it at the time, but looking back, it should have been stranger to me that he didn't come out from the building. He just hopped briskly onto the sidewalk, from the shadowy front stoop of the apartment he had been loitering outside. At one in the morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrying to pay the stranger no mind I just kept on with my own steady pace and walked ahead of him. I turned around the corner. So did he. I walked to the end of the street and cut across to the other side. So did he. I decided, to hell with all this, I was just going to pull out my phone, pretend I was changing my music, and let him pass me. So I stopped and waited for him to go on. A few steps more and he caught up with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stopped too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis stride had been quick and bouncy moments before, but the second his shoe was exactly parallel to mine, he stopped dead in his tracks. I turned to face him and saw that he was wearing jeans, and a black jacket over a gray hoodie, with the hood pulled up. He was standing right beside me, not moving. His head was pointed down at the ground a few feet ahead of him. At this point I was more than a little bit uncomfortable, so taking out my headphones I asked him \"hey, can I help you? everyting all good?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continued to stare at the ground, not acknowledging me in the slightest. I noticed he was trembling slightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Uhhhh...all right man, have a good night\" I said awkwardly, turning and beginning to walk away but not quite wanting to take my eyes off him. I took a few more steps backward and was moving to put my headphones back in and turn around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe mumbled something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What was that? I couldn't hear you man.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...check me out\" I could just barely hear him mutter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What?\" I replied again, tense and ready to make a move if this guy decided he was going to rob me or something. I wasn't exactly the strongest guy around, hell I had never even been in a real fight since middle school, but this guy also didn't look to be much more than one hundred and fifty pounds soaking wet. I felt like I could take him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis head snapped up to face mine. His eyes were wide, his mouth contorted into a huge manic grin. And when I say huge, I mean his mouth was huge. It looked completely out of proportion to the rest of his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"CHECK ME OUT!\" he screamed at the top of his lungs. \"LOOK AT ME GO!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that his jaw began to open wide and he put his entire hand inside. With a sickening wet crunch sound, he bit down. Clean through his hand. Frozen in terror, I watched as he spit the bloody, severed extremity into the street. Blood dripped from the end of his mangled arm onto the sidewalk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LOOK, LOOK\" he screamed with manic delight, \"LOOK AT ME!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe began running towards me and my flight or fight response managed to knock me out of my surreal daze and I sprinted away from him as fast as I could. I didn't pay any attention to the directions I was running in, I just ran, turning corner after corner. Feet pounding concrete, arms pumping as hard as they could. I heard frantic footsteps behind me, along with wild laughter. I turned another corner...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd collided with a garbage can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went sprawling with the can into the street. My face and hands hit the asphalt hard. I immediately tasted blood welling up inside my mouth. I began pushing up off the ground, when a hand grabbed me by the arm and violently yanked me up with shocking force. I was lifted a foot off the ground and spun a little in the air, landing me right on my ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man's grinning face was mere inches away from mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed and scampered backwards. Tears began to stream down the man's face, making a grotesque sight with his enlarged, bloody grin. He wasn't laughing, he was sobbing. \"Fella...\" he whispered. \"Why won't you just look at me?\" he asked in a begging, pleading voice. \"Let me show you, please...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stuck his remaining hand in his jaw. But this time, instead of biting down, he yanked at the bottom of his jaw as a popping, snapping sound echoed in the street. Working his hand with great effort, tears and blood marring his hideous strained face, he pulled and yanked his jaw loose until it hung about a foot lower than the rest of his head. It was limp and swaying, but still attatched. His skin had seemingly stretched with his jaw to create an enormous, dangling mouth. He had a look of sheer agony on his face, but he was still trying to work his distended mouth into a grin. Then, he sat down in the street.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJumping to my feet, I watched with horror as he began to grab his ankles, one at a time and insert his feet into his gaping maw. He crunched and chomped as blood flowed freely from his mouth into the street. He continued down the rest of his legs, using his hand to feed them along. He was still shouting and talking to me as I began to sprint away, but his words were difficult to make out in the gutteral mess of slobbering, grunting and cracking. Even so, I'm sure of what he was saying. When I think of his pleading gaze and unrestrained shaking, I am certain it could have been only one thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LOOK. AT. ME\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...........\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran in a frenzy. I began to recognize some of my surroundings, but my head wasn't clear enough for navigation. I kept running until I saw the light of a 24/7 diner. Bursting through the door, the startled staff eyed me nervously as I hurried into the bathroom. I couldn't blame them. My face was bloody and bruised where it had slammed into the street. I had a little bit on my jacket and hands as well. I washed up in the sink and then went to the corner booth. Still wary of me, the waitress took my order of coffee with a side of bacon. I took liberal sips of my flask, trying to be discreet. I don't think anyone cared enough to say anything. I sat in that booth, staring out the window, occasionally ordering a top off for my coffee or a biscuit, until it began to get light out. Around five in the morning, the streets were beginning to bustle with activity. I got up, left a sizeable tip for the waitresses trouble and began to walk home. I took a long, winding route far away from the neighborhoods where my encounter with the man took place. I kept my ear to the ground for information regarding an assault in the street, but I heard nothing. I had definitely expected a severed hand on the sidewalk to make the news. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called out of work for the evening. And then again the next day. I told them I was sick, but I think they thought I was on a binge. And they weren't wrong. As far as I was concerned, I had discovered one more reason to drink myself stupid...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI arrived home from the liquor store, 3 bottles in hand, and already falling down drunk. I threw my keys and wallet in the general direction of the counter and cracked open another bottle. The vodka burned my throat going down. Bottle in hand, I walked through my apartment into my bathroom and looked in the mirror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI froze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the bathroom counter was a severed hand, finger pointed at me. At the doorway. On the mirror, written in what looked like blood, I read three words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*LOOK. AT. ME.*\n\nBehind me, I heard a dragging noise, followed by a thump. \n\nAnd then a whimper.",

        "text": "I always saw Marilyn walking three huge dogs in the park. She was a little 5'1 woman walking these giant bernese mountain dogs and handling it with ease. I was in love even though I didn’t know a single thing about her. \n\nI worked up the courage to talk to her. She was nice but hesitant. She seemed like an exceptionally wary person. \n\nI was patient and earned her trust. I slowly discovered she was everything I had built her up to be in my head, and then some. \n\nWe dated for months without her ever inviting me to her place. She always said she lived at the edge of town and hated it, but it was odd, and unnerving. I spent a lot of my time wondering what the issue was? *Was she married or a hoarder?*\n\nWe were six months in and had too many drinks when I confronted her on never inviting me over. I wasn’t taking no for an answer, she had to bring me over, or I was breaking up with her. \n\nMarilyn brought me home. She wasn’t married. She wasn’t a hoarder. She did live on the other edge of town in a little house filled with her giant dogs. Nothing was out of the ordinary. \n\n*Things didn’t stay that way.* \n\nMarilyn’s dogs behaved strangely. They would start barking or growling at random spots and corners of the house - as if there was an intruder.\n\nThis also got worse in the middle of the night. The dogs constantly got up around 3 a.m. barking and going crazy and sniffing all around the room while we slept. \n\nI think I knew what scent they were picking up on. It was a male scent - musty cigarettes, sweat, and the sting of men’s deodorant trying to cover it all up. It was so strong I was getting ready to confront Marilyn on it. *Did she have a man who was staying there when I wasn’t there?* The power of the smell was undeniable, as was a strong presence of someone else in the house. \n\nI asked Marilyn about it. She was very matter of fact. She was haunted by a male spirit. It always lingered. She didn’t think it was dangerous, but it was scary, and it wasn’t the house, it was her, it had been with her for a couple years now, and different locations. \n\nShe asked if it was a deal breaker? \n\nNo. I was all in. I loved her. \n\nI could deal with ghosts. I could deal with feeling like I was always being watched. I could deal with never feeling alone. \n\nI wasn’t prepared to deal with what the actual reality was though. \n\nWe spent time at Marilyn’s place. Those supernatural oddities always lingered. She explained she got the three giant dogs to protect her from whatever it was. \n\nEverything had become kind of second nature to me until one day when we walked into the house and Marilyn peeped right back out the living room blinds. \n\n“I keep seeing the same middle-aged woman everywhere I go,” Marilyn whispered. \n\nI had no idea at the time that sentence was the opening line to a horror movie the two of us were about to live. \n\n“She’s plain, always wearing a hat, sunglasses, super small, and always driving a white car, a Honda,” Marilyn went on.\n\nI knew the car. I had seen it several times in the past few months. I also could picture a woman, hat, sunglasses, small. She always seemed to be around like an extra in a movie about my life. \n\nIt was my time to admit something to Marilyn. I had a stalker, and apparently she was back. \n\nI dated a girl named Savannah for nearly a year in my early-20s. She came off as just sweet at first. Obsessed with me in the right way, then it became the wrong way. I’ll spare too much detail but I at one point found out that she was secretly recording almost everything we did in her apartment and she collected random things of mine - loose hairs, keeping socks and underwear, even nail clippings. \n\nShe also seemed to be developing an inability to be away from me for any period of time. She was showing up at my office every day, making me go to long lunches, a couple times I was just running errands and I thought she was following me in her car. \n\nIt was too much. We had only been together for a few months. I broke it off.\n\nSavannah didn’t take it well. She kept calling and texting me non-stop. Kept showing up at my office, my house, she wouldn’t take no for an answer. \n\nI eventually threatened a restraining order and pressing charges. She was in medical school and wanted to become a doctor. She knew that kind of thing could really affect her career. She finally relented. \n\nI remained connected to Savannah on social media. It appeared she moved to another state, got a boyfriend, and eventually married. I mostly forgot about her. \n\nShe was definitely the middle-aged woman who was following us though. Her build. The way she moved. It was all her, I just had never thought it was possible. She was also clearly trying to make herself look older and more plain than she really was. \n\nA distant friend of mine I hadn’t talked to in years was still connected to her through his girlfriend. I hit him up to see if he knew what the deal was. \n\nMy friend provided anything but comforting information about Savannah. She hadn’t moved out of state. She wasn’t married. She didn’t have kids. As far as he knew, she still lived in the area with her parents, had dropped out of med school, and was a recluse. He also didn’t think she had social media. \n\nI did some investigating. The social media accounts of Savannah’s I was still connected to were flimsy - barely any friends or followers or content. I did some research of people I knew she was actually related to and it looked like the man in her life was actually her sister’s husband and the kids, her niece and nephew. She may have been maintaining them just to throw me off. \n\nIt also started to click with me. I had seen that white car a lot even before I was with Marilyn. I had also seen a plain, middle-aged woman, with long black hair that I now thought looked like a wig, always wearing a ton of clothes, even in the summer. I just never thought to think anything of it. \n\nI was sure Savannah had probably been stalking me all along. It probably never stopped. She was probably just turning up the heat since she saw me get serious with Marilyn. Feeling her grip slip away. \n\nI was going to follow through with the restraining order this time and pursue pushing Savannah away for the full extent of the law. Only problem was, I had to prove it was her and she was doing it. Restraining orders are a lot harder to set up than you might think. \n\nI was always on the lookout for Savannah with my hand in my pocket - ready to whip out my phone to take a photo or video. But it was like she knew. I never saw her or her white car again. \n\nThe only problem was the haunting and the agitation of Marilyn’s dogs in her house got more and more intense. It seemed to be all hours of the day now and more jarring - the dogs getting full on angry - the presence in her house slamming and locking doors. \n\nIt got so intense we started setting up cameras around the house to try and capture something. It didn’t work until one of them fell behind the couch and accidentally got aimed at the backyard for a day and night. \n\nThe first video alert hit me during the day while I was at work. A neighborhood kid walked through the yard, nothing sinister. It was so harmless I didn’t even remember to move the camera when I got home. \n\nThe next time I woke up to a Ring notification in the middle of the night. I checked the camera and saw the neighborhood kid again - in the backyard again, but this time moving towards the back door. \n\nI was no longer just writing this off as an innocent neighborhood, teenage boys will be boys moment. I shot out of bed, ran out of the bedroom and took to the living room flanked by all three dogs. \n\nI was startled by what waited for me inside the living room, not outside. A tall young man faced the doorway - the image of his broad back, cloaked in a t-shirt flashing before my eyes for a second before he was gone. \n\nThe dogs weren’t bothered by the flash of a presence of the man - they ran right for the door and kept erupting with barking. \n\nI checked the Ring app - I saw the kid walking out the backyard and disappearing into the darkness. I breathed a sigh of relief and tried to calm the dogs. \n\nThen I heard Marilyn scream from the bedroom. \n\nI rushed to the bedroom and found Marilyn standing next to the bed and looking over at the window in horror. It was the middle of summer and we were fighting the heat, sleeping with the windows open. \n\nI could visibly see the screen had been cut and the blinds in front of the window were swaying on a windless night. \n\n“Someone tried to grab me,” Marilyn whispered to me, staring at the darkness of the window. \n\nA thought came over me at that moment just before I started to comfort Marilyn - I wasn’t so sure it was a “neighborhood boy” who terrorized us that night. The size, the movements on the Ring camera - it all added up to Savannah, but dressed as a teenage boy.\n\n\\-\n\nI took the footage to the police and tried to get that restraining order on Savannah. They said it couldn’t be proved it was her in the videos. \n\nIt was a failure, but it didn’t matter, because it all stopped. The appearances of Savannah and the haunting. \n\nMarilyn and I, and the dogs, were finally able to rest easy. We settled into life at her house. \n\nWe made it a year with everything going perfectly. We fell full into love. \n\nI proposed. She said yes. I moved into her place. We slept with her giant dogs every night - safe and happy.\n\nThen the haunting started to pick up again. \n\nIt was intense. We would be lying in bed and hear someone walking out in the hallway or we would be in the bathroom and suddenly see a man standing behind us in the mirror. \n\nI had to learn to live with it though. I loved her and it just was what it was. I hoped it would get better. \n\nSomething else unfortunate started to happen after the haunting got bad for a while though. *Savannah was back.* \n\nIt took a while to see it because she was changing vehicles so much and changing her looks. She had gained a ton of weight and wore shoes which made her look taller.\n\nWe went back to the process of trying to capture her in photos and videos, but again, she seemed to know when we were onto her, and disappeared. \n\nThere was another calm for a few weeks. It didn’t feel the way the one did before though. It felt more like the eye of a storm. \n\nIt came at night again. *The haunting*. \n\nMarilyn and I were asleep in the middle of the night. All of the lights and electronics in our bedroom flashed on. We woke right up. \n\nI saw the split second image of the silhouette of the man by the bedroom door. It was such second nature to me at this point I didn’t even bat an eye. \n\nIt was different this time though. The image of the man lingered and I finally really got a look at him. He was young. Probably around 20 - dark hair, dark features, tall, thin, and a little rugged. \n\nI heard Marilyn whimper and looked over to her. She was crying as she looked at the young man. \n\nThen my attention was drawn to the door as it opened slowly. I held my breath and saw a shadow step just inside the room. \n\nI saw the sight of a gun emerge from around the corner. I froze like a deer in the headlights. \n\nWhoever was aiming that gun at Marilyn and I had a wide open shot. I could sense they were about to pull the trigger. \n\nI closed my eyes. In that little moment of darkness, I heard a scuffle break out. \n\nI opened my eyes and saw the male figure wrestling in the doorway with whoever had the gun - and the male figure was winning, forcing them out of the room. I don’t know what came over me, but I rushed in that direction, leaving Marilyn and the dogs, still frozen behind me. \n\nI was out in the hallway and watching the person with the gun get chased out of the house. I followed them into the living room where I saw a window broken out. \n\nFor another time, I was able to recognize who was terrorizing us. I could see her small, frail frame, trying to fight off this powerful spirit of a young man. There was no denying it was Savannah with the gun.\n\nI saw Savannah on the ground, trying to fight off the spirit and struggling. For a second, I kind of felt sorry for her, down there on the ground, tiny and hurt and insane. I doubt stalking us and getting pummeled by a ghost was what she had always wanted in life. She was simply sick. \n\nThose thoughts were running through my head when I watched Savannah slip away from the spirit and rush out the window. \n\n*I had a feeling I was never going to actually see her again this time.* \n\nI also had a feeling about that with the spirit of the young man as well. I looked at his back as I heard Savannah run away into the night out the broken window. \n\nThe spirit of the young man turned to me for a brief second. I saw a sense of relief on his face for a moment. \n\nI felt someone approach me from behind. I was startled at first and turned around to see Marilyn and the dogs walking into the living room. \n\nThe spirit of the young man finally turned around. I watched him meet Marilyn’s gaze. \n\nThe two of them held eyes for a very long time. Everyone silent. Tears gushed out of Marilyn’s eyes now. \n\nI watched the spirit of the young man nod to her. I watched and heard Marilyn start to break down. \n\nI looked over again and the spirit of the young man was gone. \n\nThen I went to comfort Marilyn.\n\n\\-\n\nI had connected some dots before Marilyn even started mapping them out to me. The spirit which had been hovering around us and haunting us was of her older brother, Casey. \n\nCasey died in a snowboarding accident years before, shattering Marilyn’s young life. Her brother had been her hero and protector and he was gone suddenly when she was in her vulnerable teenage years. \n\nCasey had always told Marilyn he would be there for her. She thought he was actually ramping up his presence and haunting when he knew Savannah was hovering and coming for us - Casey pushing himself back into our world to protect her. \n\nThe whole thing actually made Marilyn feel good. It gave her some comfort and resolution with Casey. \n\nWhat happened with Savannah was not comforting. We had a ton of video evidence of her and the police were finally okay with moving forward with several charges. \n\nOnly problem was the police couldn’t find Savannah. She had moved out of her parents’ house weeks before and no one had any contact with her. \n\nMarilyn and I weren’t as scared as we could have been though. \n\n*We had a feeling someone would protect us.* ",

        "text": "  \n\nI am a saturation diver in a pressurized structure at the ocean floor, 1000 feet below the surface of the water. At this depth the water pressure is 30 times more than at the surface and it takes a week of slow ascension to the surface in order for us not to get decompression sickness and die. We are down here working for 21 days and then we spend a week to ascend safely. Right now in our chamber we have 12 days left of the various gasses giving us life and we are expected at the surface in 7 days. This would all sound like a typical day for anyone familiar with our line of work, but there are several problems. We have no way of getting back to the surface. Not now, not in 12 days when we begin to suffocate. That problem is caused by are largest problem, the thing outside that found us at the bottom of the ocean. \n\nThere were six of us that came down for the initial work cycle. There were only 4 beds, but we would sleep in a rotation anyway. 6 men is a lot for this type of work in this small space but it was a big job, paid an unbelievable amount of money. The living quarter was a 7 by 7 room, the bedroom 5 by 6. We lived in this miniature space for 28 days, we did our best to get along. Whenever you go the opportunity to work in the water, however, you took it. So on the day the creature found us, Steven and Bobby were delighted when it came their turn to go outside and get some work done on the oil rig. I was on equipment watch, making sure their gas levels were ok, watching vitals. John and Glenn were sleeping, Evan was watching the cameras and talking to the boys outside.\n\nWe were about 30 minutes from being done and pulling the boys in when Bobby came in over the radio. \n\n“Hey boys, did anybody hear that?”\n\n“Sounded like a whale. Awful close though, usually they aren’t this close to the floor.” \n\n“I didn’t hear anything in here, Bobby, sorry.”\n\n“Never heard a whale make that noise but oh well. It’ll see the lights on the rig and go the other way.”\n\nAfter about 10 more minutes we heard from Steve.\n\n“God damn that’s an unsettling sound. Must be a female giving birth or something. Hopefully it isn’t dying.”\n\n“We’re gonna switch the radio to the rig mics for a second see if we hear anything.” There are microphones at different sealed positions on the rig that were monitored by software at the surface base. This is there because often times you can hear something break a lot quicker than you can see it. Evan turned our radio to pick up the mic sounds. It took about 30 seconds but eventually we heard it too. It wasn’t a god damn whale. \n\nThe pitch was too low. Maybe not to the untrained ear, maybe not to some animals even, but I knew immediately that wasn’t a whale. It was a rumbling, filling cry with a small blare to the end of it, it sent a chill down my spine. \n\n“Hey boys I think maybe its time to pack it in, we should be able to finish everything on the next shift.”\n\n“I’m not gonna leave this pipe unfinished and give Johnny a reason to complain about me pulling my weight. Not a chance in hell.”\n\nI was torn. I didn’t know if letting the panic in my voice blead through the radio would make things better or worse. In between button pushed I was telling Evan to get the hatches ready and wake the others. He looked at me funny at first but when I turned back around and looked at him I guess he saw on my face that I as serious. \n\n“I hate to pull rank here boys but I need you inside now, that’s an order.”\n\n“Where the fuck do you think we are? This isn’t the navy. Just make sure our gas is good so I can finish.”\n\nThat’s the last thing Steven would ever say to me. Or to anyone. In an instant his coms went out, his vitals and his gas went through the roof and through the floor. A look at his head cam was just rushing water and imperceivable flashes of light and steel. Radio waves don’t travel the water, you have to be connected to your gas line to have communication. I stared at the silent images of what looked like traveling through hyper space underwater. The vital alarm was blaring, Steve’s heart rate was sky rocketing, his oxygen levels almost at zero.\n\n“What the fuck was that?! Get me inside, get me inside!” Bobby started to pull himself to the hatch by his gas line, it’s almost impossible to move quickly out there, but he was scooting.\n\n“What’s happening!” Johnny and Glenn woke up with all of the noise, they stared at the screens in terror, Glenn acted quickly he got to the hatch and started to open the outside door to flood the entry chamber. In the meantime Steve’s camera went black. No more rushes of light and structures, just blackness in front of him. The next thing I heard will stay with me as long as I live, which actually may not be very long. \n\n“What the fuck is that?! Dear God. Guys pull me in! Pull me in for fucks sake! It’s coming towards me!”\n\nBobby was still 30 yards from the hatch, the gas lines don’t just retract you have to pull them in. We were pulling as hard as we could but then Bobby screamed and his coms were gone. The thing didn’t drag him through the water though. Once it ripped him from his gas line it threw him to the ocean floor. As we looked up through Bobby’s camera we saw it descend upon him. A giant white creature with jet black eyes and a rounded snout like a turtle. It had claws attached to it’s massive torso and a tail fin double it’s size. It shouldn’t have moved very fast, it didn’t seem like it was built for any kind of speed. As it got closer I could make out scars on it’s body. Some of them the length of either claw. Whatever this thing was it wasn’t alone, there was something big enough out there to cause it harm. In that moment my body went void of hope or anything good. I was completely swallowed by fear and the realization I would suffocate in this metal box on the ocean floor. Eventually Bobby’s camera went black too, but not before we got a look at the inside of the thing’s mouth. \n\nBase said they were going to send a rescue crew but when they saw the footage from Bobby’s camera they said it was too risky. They asked to brave the ascension, get to the surface like were supposed to before, we started to get ready to ascend but when Glenn looked through the rig cameras he saw it out in the open water, waiting. It was fixated on our chamber, barely moved. Looked like it was asleep. \n\nThe last thing we decided was that risking the ascension was worth it, even with that thing out there. Even if it caught us and tore the ascension vessel apart it would be quicker and probably less painful than suffocating. We were all packed and ready to go when Glenn saw the wreckage of the ascension vessel fall to the sea floor in front of us. Personally I’m in favor of opening the hatch and getting this whole thing over with but Glenn and Johnny want to wait until base camp tells us there’s no chance we’re gonna make it but I know they aren’t coming. Would you get in the water if you knew that thing was around? I wouldn’t have.",

Not when so many people are in danger. Just… Just remember me, and my story. Please.\n\nOkay, so everything, this personal Hell of mine, it all started two months ago. I won’t say where I live, just in case it finds this post. I was working a shift at my job as a psychologist, and I’ve been seeing a few patients consistently for months at this point. All of them are a bit odd, but that’s to be expected. People are unique, and I’m not one to judge.\n\nI feel like I have a reason to be worried.\n\nThree of my patients (using fake names for their safety, not sure it matters now) were Elias, Thomas, and Marie. All three of them had been previously diagnosed with PTSD from being veterans, and often have flashbacks. I gave them my number so that they could call me if they were going to do anything… rash. I made them promise that they would call me.\n\nElias was found dead two months ago. The police ruled it a suicide, but I know that’s not true. When I went to his house, I noticed three things: the note was not his writing style, the noose was sloppily tied, and his medication was gone. I could excuse the last two and call him mentally unstable, but the note wasn’t how he writes at all. It broke me to see such a good man in such a state. I went to the coroner’s office and asked for the suicide note. I got permission from the police to keep the suicide note, and I checked for any invisible ink. Call it a hunch, but I’m certain that Elias would not say things like this. Nothing new showed up on the page.\n\nFor context, I know I didn’t mess it up. My granddad was an FBI agent and my great grandma was a codebreaker in World War 2, and my parents always raised me to ask questions, to look for answers until there are none left to find.\n\nAnyway, back to the note.\nThe note said that he was sorry, but he couldn’t go on, everything was too much.\n\nThe ink said differently.\n\nI spilled a bit of coffee on the note, and the ink was now red and the words were beyond unsettling. It said “IT IS COMING.” in bold, jagged letters. I thought my eyes much be playing ticks on me when I looked out my window and saw a figure on the street, but it disappeared when I blinked. The red ink was gone from the letter, too. Just poof, gone.\n\nI did not sleep that night. Marie died a week and a half later from a drug overdose, but I don’t believe that either. One death is a tragedy, and I never believed in coincidences. Marie overdosed on ziprasidone, a medication for hallucinations. I never gave her that, nor did any other doctors. Apparently, she had a psychotic break due to her hallucinations and overdosed, but I have never heard such bullshit. I demanded to see her body after the autopsy, and the police were very hesitant, but allowed me to see her body. I almost cried when I saw her. She was a good woman and I couldn’t imagine anyone doing this to her. Yes, I am fully convinced that she was murdered.\n\nOn her palm were the words “I SEE YOU” in the same jagged letters, but they were etched into her skin. I heard a thud, and turned around to see the same figure outside the door. Again, gone in the blink of an eye. And again, the words were gone, too.\n\nI went to the local library of my town and looked for any records of paranormal encounters the following morning. I don’t believe in ghosts, or monsters. At least, I didn’t back then. Now… I’m not so sure.\n\nThere was some record of a group of settlers disappearing in the 1850’s, but nothing too detailed. There was also an old news article about a few prospectors were found ripped to shreds in the desert, but nothing fit. Again, I won’t say where I live.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI hear it.\n\nIt’s scratching at the window.\n\nOh god.\n\n…\n\nIt’s stopped. I have to rush this out. I need to tell you what happened to Thomas. Poor… poor… Thomas…\n\nThomas went missing three days ago. He was getting more and more paranoid following the deaths of Marie and Elias, saying that something was after them. He kept on screaming names of monsters in our last session, saying that it was coming to take him. I… I’m ashamed to say I didn’t believe him. I’m sorry, Thomas.\n\nI found him two hours ago, and that’s why I have to post this: this is my last chance to set the record straight. There is something out here, and it killed Marie, Thomas and Elias.\n\nMarie’s body was taken out of the morgue to be transported for the funeral, and the truck was attacked. The metal was ripped to shreds, it was torn and blood was everywhere. It has been hidden from the public, but look into the accidents surrounding the Sedona area in December of last year. I was driving when I saw a bloodied truck, limbs and bones scattered, and no coffin, only a trail of blood in the Arizona sand. When I blinked, it was gone.\n\nElias’s body was cremated, but somebody stole his ashes. The next day, the morgue was set ablaze. Marie and Elias were in different morgues, but that is not a coincidence. His urn was never recovered, but when I drove by the burnt remains, I saw the black figure, but it was more… animalistic. It had horns, it was taller, and it was on all fours, but still seemed vaguely human. Blink, gone.\n\nWhen Thomas… When Thomas’s body was found two hours ago, the police wouldn’t let me see him, but I had to, I just had to. It was horrible. Nothing was left of him except for his left hand, his bones, and bits of blood and flesh, all scattered across the alleyway. His left hand had his engagement ring on it. He had finally found happiness, and it was taken away from both him and his fiancé.\n\nOn his ring was one phrase, and I knew it well. “Til death do us part.” His fiancé loved that phrase. I can’t tell him now, I can’t. I don’t have time. The engraved words were different. It said, in that same, damned font…\n\n“I AM STILL HUNGRY.”\n\nI blinked, and I saw the disgusting, rotting face of some skeleton of a creature, smiling back at me with a toothy grin. It whispered my name, and I wanted to cry. I blinked, and it was gone. I drove home and locked every door and window, and now I’m hiding in my attic.\n\nI can hear it coming for me now. In the shadows, through the walls. Devin, Thomas loved you. Anthony, take care of Muffin and Thumper for Marie. Rosemary, I’m sorry about Elias.\n\nIt’s coming.\n\nIt’s going to eat me.\n\nIt’s calling out to me.\n\nIt is still hungry. Maybe it will be quick. Maybe the thing isn’t real.\n\nBlink. It’s here. Blink. It’s smiling. Blink. It extends its freakishly long claws, caressing my face tenderly, leaving a little scratch along my cheek. Blink. It’s gone.\n\nI breathed out a breath of relief that it’s gone, but I pause, unable to think anything but this one phrase:\n\n**It’s still hungry.**",

        "text": "I am a personal chef who only works with private clients. My most important clients are the ones who hire me to cook for private feasts. But there are also clients for whom I do meal prep for a week or more depending on what they want. When I moved to France from the United States, I immersed myself in the world of French cuisine. To learn the fundamentals, I enrolled in classes at a reputable culinary school. I then worked in several restaurants and hotels in Bordeaux and Nice, gradually working my way up the ranks. After nearly a year as a junior chef in a well-known Lyon restaurant and nearly reaching the position of sous-chef, I quit. Don't get me wrong. My passion for food and cooking is undeniable. It's just the constant stress that makes things overwhelming for me. I was tired of the toxic environment and the restaurant's head chef's constant criticism. So, despite being one of the most talented graduates in my promotion, with a promising future as a female star chef, I chose self-employment over the highly competitive world of gastronomy. And that's how I ended up in Paris as a private chef.\n\nWhat I like best about my current job as a personal chef is that I work mostly from home, except for feasts, and it pays very well. I have regular clients most of the time, but I also get new ones on occasion. I should mention that, aside from my cooking skill sets, my clients' top request is discretion. Of course, as a safety rule, before accepting any deal, I always inquire about the nature of the party as well as the location of the event. During my 5 years as a personal chef in France, I had to cook meals for a wide variety of events, such as masked balls, bar mitzvahs, and birthday parties, but also orgies, BDSM \"private soirées,\" and even LSD special parties. Because of that, a lot of my clients ask me to sign an NDA with very specific terms. Usually, I don’t mind. Who am I to judge people and what they do with their lives?\n\nOf course, because I aspire to be one of Paris' most sought-after personal chefs, I am constantly on the lookout for distinguished clients who can help me to reach my goal. That's when I met with my last client, Monsieur Dugibier.\n\nMr. Dugibier is a descendant of a French aristocratic family. He commissioned me to prepare a feast for a three-day hunting party. The feast would be held in a château in the south of France, which is unusual for me. To be honest, I was thrilled with this opportunity. It gonna be a fantastic boost for my career as a female personal chef, and it could introduce me to France's very close circle of nobility. The opportunities for a lucrative career were endless. I couldn't have asked for a better chance, so I was determined to bring my A-game. My client and I agreed on the menu and made certain that all of the ingredients were ready for delivery to the château in time for the feast. He assured me that his kitchen staff would assist me throughout the preparation. Which I was grateful for.\n\nI rarely spend the night at the homes of my clients. But I made an exception on this particular occasion. My client suggested that I stay at the château because it would be more convenient than traveling back and forth to a hotel for three days. So far, everything seemed to be in order, and I was ready to leave Paris for the south of France in the last week of September.\n\nMr. Dugibier called me the day I was to leave, saying he was in Paris for work and offered to drive me to the château. I was reluctant because it would disrupt my plans, and I hate it when unexpected events occur. At the same time, the trip from Paris to the town where the château was would take me at least 7 exhausting hours. He told me that it would be difficult anyway to find the road to the château in that remote area and assured me there would be enough space in his SUV for any supplies and tools I wanted to bring with me. I was too embarrassed to decline the offer. I ended up saying yes. I told myself that, at the very least, I wouldn't be exhausted when I arrived. So Mr. Dugibier and his chauffeur picked me up from my apartment around midday and we headed to the Dugibier domain, where the hunt and feast would be held.\n\nI had only spoken with Monsieur Dugibier over the phone until the trip that day. So I got a good look at him during the ride. He was most likely in his late forties. He had salt and pepper hair and a clean shaved face. I could tell by his body posture and calloused hand when we shook hands that he was practicing sport. Most likely martial arts or maybe boxing. And, with his sun-kissed skin and green eyes, I couldn't deny that he was a very attractive man. His most striking feature, however, was his piercing, almost predator-like gaze, which would make even the most confident person uneasy. Being so close to him in the backseat of the car made me uncomfortable. I was genuinely intrigued by this man. It was obvious to me that there were likely interesting facts about him. Mr. Dugibier handed me my contract and the NDA to sign as soon as the chauffeur got on the road. He then informed me that his accountant would make an advance payment today. He made a quick phone call before turning toward me and giving me a pretty odd smile.\n\n\"So, Allie is not your real name, \" said Mr. Dugibier while I handed him the NDA’s signed copy.\"I've never heard of the name Aquetzalli before. Is it a Spanish name?\" He enquired with his piercing green eyes and almost perfect English.\n\n\"It's a Nahuatl name. It is an ancient Amazonian ethnic group living in Mexico and other countries in the area. It’s a difficult name to pronounce so I’ve always been called Allie.\" \n\n\"What exactly does it mean?\" Mr. Dugibier insisted. \n\n\"Feather or maybe precious thing… I'm not sure.\" I said absentmindedly. \n\n\"You don't look Mexican at all. I mean, your features are... unique.\" He had a point. In contrast to my mother and half-sisters, who have dark hair and eyes, I have hazel eyes and light brown, almost honey-colored hair. \n\n\"True.\" \n\n\" Were you born in Mexico or USA?\" \n\n\" I was born and raised in the US,\" I said without further details. I don’t like discussing my childhood and my family. So I didn’t say more. I think Mr. Dugibier got the hint so he just nodded. \n\n\"Did you always want to work in gastronomy?\" \n\n\"No no… it was rather a change of path I did in my late twenties.\" Mr. Dugibier gave me a curious look. \"I was working in another sector when I was living in the US, but then, when I visited France, I decided to become a Chef.\" \n\n\"Oh, okay…\". This seemed to surprise him, but he didn't ask any further questions. \"Do you work out… Aquetzalli?\" he asked after a moment, an unsettling grin on his face. This rather personal question took me off guard. \n\n\"Umm... just call me Allie… and yes. I mean I work out whenever I have time.\" \n\n\"Please forgive me for this personal question, Allie,\" apologized Mr. Dugibier with a smile. \"I simply appreciate those who work in gastronomy and make a point to take care of their health. And I can see that you are in very good shape! \"\n\nI returned the smile. If only he knew how many trophies I won in running contests in my college years. My trainer once told me that I have a wolf's heart and a hunter's endurance, the marathon-winning combo. The memory felt like this happened ages ago. \n\n\"Thanks.\" I didn't want to linger more on that, so I changed the topic. \"Do you go on the hunt every year, Mr. Dugibier?\"  \nMr. Dugibier did not immediately answer my question. He paused for a moment then said absently: \"No, not every year. But I'm hoping for a successful hunt as we’ll have international guests this year.\"\n\nThen, to my relief, he took a folder from his suitcase and said he had some work to do. And that was the end of the conversation. I took out my iPad to do the same. I checked my emails before adding some details to the menu for the upcoming feast. I checked my Apple Watch: six hours to go. I figured I could use this time to work on my cooking book project. So I went through my notes and did some editing. The rest of the trip was pleasant. I reviewed the map I had downloaded the day before. So far, we were following the same path that I had planned. We stopped twice for a quick rest and Mr. Dugibier offered me a coffee at the second stop. When we returned to the road, I tried to read a little bit but felt exhausted and sleepy. I eventually gave up and dozed off for the rest of the trip.\n\nIt was almost 7 p.m. when I awoke suddenly, a bit disoriented. We were driving inside a very dense forest. \n\n\"We are inside my family's domain.\" Explained Mr. Dugibier when he noticed me looking around in almost a stupor. \"This is one of the oldest forests in France and my family worked hard to protect it throughout the centuries, especially during World War I, when the armies needed wood.\" \n\n\"It's easy to get lost in here,\" I remarked while looking out the window. \n\n\"You've got no idea!\" Mr. Dugibier exclaimed, a strange smile on his face.\n\nWe drove for another half hour through the forest before arriving at the Château's gates. There were multiple cameras and an access control system. The gate was wrought iron, adorned with ivy and wild animals, and bore the Dugibier family coat of arms: a man holding a bow and an arrow, pointing at what appeared to be an animal running on... two legs. What ?! I squinted to double-check, but the gates had opened and the SUV had already entered the driveway, so I couldn't be sure. How odd…\n\nWe crossed a two-mile-long alley lined with chestnut trees on both sides. It was sunset and a beautiful sunlight was shining through the trees. In the distance, a looming French Château with stunning blue tiles, reminiscent of the castles we see in movies, emerges on an immaculate meadow. I was in awe. The château Dugibier was almost making a statement as if to demonstrate the strength of this family over time. As we approached the château, I noticed the two towers in the middle of the front, decorated with blue tiles and some sort of gargoyles.\n\n\"Do you have any kids?\" I jumped when Mr. Dugibier spoke. He must have noticed my frown and flashed one of his unsettling grins at me.\"I simply thought it would be lovely if you had brought your little family to enjoy this place while you were working.\" \n\n\"No, I don't have any children. I am not married.\" \n\n\"Ah...how unfortunate\" nodded Mr. Dugibier, a curious smile on his face that didn’t touch his piercing green eyes. As the car stopped he added: \"Thank you, Allie, for coming to Château Dugibier. I believe you'll find your time here... fascinating.\" \n\n\"I will, without a doubt, Mr. Dugibier.\" For some reason, I didn’t like this false innocent question that Mr. Dugibier asked. Why am I having this weird feeling?\n\nI heard dogs barking when we arrived at the front of the château. It must be the hounds they use for hunting. A tall man was waiting at the foot of the doors. He opened the car door and exchanged a few words in French with Mr. Dugibier before turning his attention to me and nodding. \"Simon will take you to your room and show you the kitchens later.\" Said Mr. Dugibier. He added while entering the château’s front door. \"If you need anything, please ask Simon. I'll see you tomorrow.\" I waited for Simon, a grim old man, to take my luggage from the car. Then I followed him through the main château entrance where Mr. Dugibier entered.\n\nThe entrance was a huge room with a big chandelier hanging in the center. The top floor's oakwood stairs at the back end were decorated with exquisite woodcarvings. The entry's tall ceilings, plastered in the traditional French château style, were embellished with paintings of dancing figures and various flora and flowers. Simon and I headed toward a corridor on the left side of the château. This place was filled with stunning works of art and furniture, some of which may have been centuries old. But despite the high level of artistic work and the great condition of the artifacts, everything here had this unsettling feeling about them, as if a terrible dark past had been written all over them. I don’t like this place. Not at all!\n\nWe took a very narrow winding staircase up the second floor. It was most likely personnel quarters. My room was literally at the end of the corridor. It was a built-in-bed room, quite simple and practical. A flowery wallpaper in yellow and green motifs gave the room a cheerful vibe. A high window was set in the middle of the chamber, while a vanity was on the right side. I couldn’t see any cabinet around when Simon opened a small wardrobe hidden on the opposite wall.\n\nI checked my phone for messages and emails while Simon was loading my luggage and opening the windows. There was no signal in this room. \"Um... Simon, I need to check my emails but I don't have any signal. Is there anywhere I can get a signal?\" \"We only have a landline phone, Miss Allie.\" \"Do you have an Internet-connected device?\" \"We don't have Internet access in the château, Miss. If you want to make a call, I can show you the phone in the office.\" \"No. It’s fine.\"Ugh... who nowadays lives without the Internet?\n\n\"There is only one bathroom on this floor, \"added Simon. Fortunately, since you're the only guest on this floor, you do not have to share it. I nodded. \"Would you like to rest for a moment before seeing the kitchen and having dinner?\" It was almost 8 p.m. and I was quite hungry. \"It's best to meet with the staff right away. I'll rest later.\"\n\nWe went back down the stairs and entered the kitchen on the main floor. It was a brand-new kitchen that was functional and outfitted with cutting-edge technology. I was greeted by the cook, an old, grim and quite sinister man, who led me to a table adjacent to the kitchen's aisle, where I was served dinner. After dinner, I had a quick meeting with the staff–the cook and two middle-aged clerks– to go over the agenda for the days to come. I gave Simon a selection of wines that I thought would complement the menu. He said he'd give it to Mr. Dugibier for approval later. Everything was fine so far, so I went to my room.\n\nThe Château was very quiet. Perhaps because the guests had not yet arrived. I took a quick shower and put on my PJs. As I lay in bed, I started to reflect on the events of the day. I don't like this place, was the first thing I can recall thinking when I walked inside the château. There was something disturbing about the château and... the staff. Everyone seemed to be on edge, waiting for something to happen. Mr. Dugibier, his chauffeur, Simon, and the others, everyone were grim and didn’t talk too much. Yes, there will be a hunt, guests, and a feast, but... whatever. As usual, I'm overthinking and stressing myself out for nothing. I have a job to do and that’s it. I was really tired so after just a few minutes I promptly fell asleep.\n\nI was sprinting through the dark woods as the barks behind me grew louder and louder. I know something or someone terrible is chasing me, but I'm too scared to turn around. “¡No estas solo ! ¡Estamos contigo !”My mother’s faint voice whispered in my ears. “Go away madre! Leave me alone!” The trees are too close together, and I keep tripping over branches and bushes. I'm completely exhausted and can hardly breathe, but I keep running as fast as I can. I trip over something on the ground and fall flat on my face. When I look over the thing, I realize it's a corps. My corps. I froze in terror. “¡Aquetzalli! Wake up! WAKE UP!”\n\nMy mother's scream jolted me awake. When I opened my eyes, my heart was racing like crazy. Everything was dark. It took me a moment to calm down and to remember that I was at the Dugibier’s château. It had all been a dream. I looked at my iWatch. It was 3:30 a.m. My mother’s scream was still ringing in my ears. The dream was so vivid and made me feel very weary. \"You are not alone,\" she said… My mother only called me Aquetzalli when she was about to tell me something very important. What does it mean? I got out of bed to drink some water and shake off that bad dream. I was annoyed just thinking about her. I hadn't been on good terms with my mother since I was in my twenties. After I moved to France, I never saw her again. My stepfather called me two years ago to tell me she had died. I no longer think about her but the dream troubled me. A moving flash of light appeared suddenly on the ceiling of my room, followed by the sound of wheels coming to a halt on the gravel. The hounds were barking somewhere outside, indicating that the guests had arrived. Mr. Dugibier informed me that the feast would be attended by 12 people. I heard voices talking outside for a moment then there was silence. I tried to sleep again but couldn't. All I could think about was the dream and... the uneasiness that began to overwhelm me. I can't wait for this feast to be over.\n\nI must have fallen asleep around dawn. My alarm went off at 7 a.m. I changed into my workout outfit and went outside. I asked Simon the night before if I could do my jogging in the area, and he said it was fine as long as I didn't go too deep into the forest. I went through the kitchen door where the cook was already preparing breakfast for the staff. As I stepped outside, I found myself on a lovely terrace overlooking the backside of the château. Rosebushes hung from the château's walls, adding a romantic and pleasant touch. This garden must require a lot of care to be this beautiful. While the main entrance to the château was dominant and formal, this side was intimate and almost welcoming.\n\nI walked around the château, past a separate building that had to be the garage, and then began running along the edge of the forest that surrounded the domain. After 45 minutes I stopped not far from the separate building to stretch. As I was contemplating whether to do another round in the forest, I heard muffled footsteps behind me. When I turned around, two enormous black dogs were sneaking up on me.\n\n\"Don't move! Don't look them in the eyes! \"Mr. Dugibier shouted somewhere near the garage.\n\nI stiffened as the dogs began to sniff and growl at me. From the corner of my eye, I could see Mr. Dugibier approaching me, almost casually. What the hell? He was intentionally taking his time, fully aware of how stressful the situation was. A quick whistle followed, and the dogs were gone in an instant. I couldn't help but throw a reproachful glare at him.\n\n\"I'm afraid you just met my trusted guard dogs.\" M. Digibier said, with a sly grin, as if we were simply having a casual conversation.\n\nI didn't realize I was holding my breath until that moment. I took a deep breath and gave him the coldest stare I could muster. \"Am I safe to walk now?\" He grinned at me as he patted the head of one of his dogs. \"Yes, you are. So long as you stay within the château's perimeter. My dogs dislike having strangers around.\"\n\nI was fuming inside. Is this a warning?\n\n\"That's good to know, Mr. Dugibier. I think I should return to the château. Please excuse me.\"\n\nI walked back to the chateau without giving him another glance. What an asshole!\n\nI went straight to my room, took a shower, and calmed down. I forced myself to push the incident out of my mind. It was time to start the work. I put on my apron and placed my iWatch on my ankle as I always do to protect it from the heat before heading to the kitchen. I was informed that the guest would take their breakfast very late. Good. I'll have enough time to plan ahead of time for lunch and dinner.\n\nAt 11 a.m. Simon came to the kitchen and told me that Mr. Dugibier wanted to see me in his study. What was it again? I hate being interrupted while cooking, especially when there is a lot of work to be done. I kept my apron and reluctantly followed Simon. We followed the same path we had taken the first time, but this time we turned to the left side of the château. We headed toward a long corridor with large windows facing the backyard. Simon came to a halt in front of the very last door and gently knocked. I could hear Mr. Dugibier talking on the phone. Simon flung open the door for me. When I walked in, he shut the door and left. The study resembled a small museum, with hundreds of pieces of art adorning the walls. It smelled of cigarettes and a strong smell of chemicals. Mr. Dugibier was sitting on his desk cleaning some sort of crossbow as he was talking in French on the phone. He motioned for me to sit. I walked over to the closest armchair but my gaze was drawn immediately to the tapestries hung on the walls. One of the tapestries depicted a mixed group of nobility relaxing in an outdoor garden, while being attended to by servants, with noticeable tanned skin. On the opposite wall, another tapestry showed a meeting of nobles, men and women, also served by colored-skin servants. The scene was set in a sort of wooden room decorated with hunting trophies. Interesting.\n\nWhen I reached the armchair, I came to a halt. Behind it was a showcase made of tainted glass containing various old medical tools and surgery items. Some of them were probably centuries old. I recognized surgical scissors, various shapes of forceps, numerous scalpels, abdominal forceps, bone forceps, bone levers, sharp hooks, and cupping vessels. Some of the tools were made of copper, while others were made of gold or bronze. As I approached the showcase, I noticed that they were in excellent condition, as if they were being used frequently…\n\n\"Ah! You noticed my favorite collection!\" I nearly jumped when I found Mr. Dugibier standing two feet behind me. He was grinning. He opened the showcase so I could get a better look.\n\n\"Those are very rare items,\" I remarked. \"Are they a heritage from doctors in your family?\"\n\n\"Not that I know.\"He grinned. \"You don’t need to be a doctor to like to possess such valuable tools.\"\n\n\"It must be worth millions, especially those two bronze-made 11th-century forceps. They were considered revolutionary at the time and had a significant impact on modern surgery.\"\n\n\"You seem to be very knowledgeable about medical stuff,\" inquired Mr. Dugibier.\n\n\" I used to be a surgeon before... umm… before moving to France.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\" When I looked at him, Mr. Dugibier was clearly stunned. \"We might have a lot in common, Allie.\" He quickly returned his attention to the showcase and cautiously closed it. He then moved to the opposite side of the study, to a small table.\n\n\"Coffee?\" he inquired, turning on a Nespresso machine.\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\nThe aroma of coffee pervaded the room. He handed me a cup and took one himself.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nAs I took a sip, I looked up at another tapestry depicting a forest scene with some very curious animals.\n\n\"I see you're a fan of arts as well.\"\n\nIs he making small talk with me right now?\n\n\"I'm sure everyone does.\"\n\nHe raised his eyes to the tapestry.\n\n\"Back in the day, artists never ventured outside of their villages. They had only heard of such exotic animals and plants from people who had traveled abroad. They never saw a jaguar, a lion, or an ostrich. They could only imagine them and create beautiful craft such these.\"\n\nMr. Dugibier remained silent for a moment, but I could see him looking at me out of the corner of my eye. \n\n\"I apologize for the fright this morning,\" he finally said. \n\n\"It's all right.\" I lied. \n\n\"Cane Corsos are fiercely protective dogs. They simply do not like strangers.\" \n\nI took a sip of my coffee. \n\n\"I understand. I'll be off in a few days anyway.\" \n\n\"In fact, I wanted to show you the château’s cellars.\" He put down his coffee cup and walked around his desk. \"I believe you gave Simon a list of wine recommendations, don't you?\" \n\n\"I did. But you don't have to show me the cellar, Mr. Dugibier. Any wine available will do.\" \n\nMr. Dugibier smiled and slightly tilted his head. \n\n\"I insist, Miss Allie, or... should I say, Doctor Allie?\" He gave me an unreadable look. It was an odd mix of admiration, sarcasm, and... something else. He then opened a drawer, took a set of old skeleton keys, and went to the door. He flipped it open and turned to me. \"Après vous, Miss Allie.\" \n\nI couldn't say no, again. So I went along with it.\n\nThe cellars were situated under the right tower of the château whereas under the other tower was the kitchen. We went in silence and took down the staircase. Mr. Dugibier opened a pair of old and heavy wooden doors and then turned the lights on. A dozen of big wooden tanks were displayed on both sides of the cellar. I had chills as we entered the cellar. It was very cold down here. The silence that filled the place was unnerving. We could hear our steps echoing inside. We headed to the end of the cellars where a huge wine display was covering the entire wall. \n\n\"Actually, we are in the ancient kitchen. It was built in the 13th century. It is the lowest and strongest part of the château. It was in the last century that we transformed it into the cellar.\" Why did he bring me here? Behind the tanks were low but strong vaults over stony walls. I spotted an old chimney that must be at least 5 meters high. There was also an old well. It was covered but I could see its old wooden notched pulley system. I was having goosebumps. This entire place was rough and raw, with a strong sense of ... secrecy.\n\nRather than going to the wine display, Mr. Dugibier walked around the table in the center of the room and then to the opposite wall. A tablecloth was draped over a large object. \"I want to show you my favorite item in the entire château,\" said Mr. Dugibier with a delighted air while uncovering a big wooden chopping block. What the hell?\n\n\"When we measured this block, it couldn’t fit either through the windows or the doors of the ancient kitchen. So it must have been here before they finished this part of the chateau. We believe it is the oldest piece in this entire château.\"He then looked at me and grinned. \"It seems petrified, but it’s not. It’s just the blood and the grease and grime from centuries of good service,\" added Mr. Dugibier as he ran his fingers lightly across the chopping block, and without taking his eyes off mine for a second.\n\nA terrifying chill run up my spine. In an instant, his entire demeanor shifted. He was starting to scare me. He moved slowly towards me, his gaze fixed on mine. He slowly caressed my right cheek with the same fingers in a swift and confident gesture. My heart was thumping against my ribcage. He got so close to me, I could see the dark patches on his green eyes. A cold and deep fear began to crip on my skin. The smell of coffee and cigarette filled my nostrils and I could feel his breath on my lips. He then took a step back, a sad smile on his lips. \"How unfortunate,\" he sighed. What?? It took a lot of effort for me to gather my wits and speak in a low voice. \"I should go back to the kitchen.\" I stepped aside and made my way to the cellar doors. It took all of my strength not to run on the staircase and then into the corridor. Back in the kitchen, I tried to remain calm so that the others wouldn't notice my trembling hands. All of the excitement and enthusiasm that had filled me up before this feast had vanished, leaving me with a sense of dread.\n\nBeing preoccupied with the cooking helped me to push back the terrifying thoughts that had been creeping into my mind since that strange interaction in the cellars with Mr. Dugibier. But as soon as the lunch was served and we paused before starting the dinner preparation, the anxious thoughts returned. What if Mr. Dugibier was some sort of pervert and was planning to do me harm? I am strong enough to defend myself for sure, but just the thought of it gave me cramps. If I had come in my car, I would have made whatever excuse I could and driven away. I felt trapped. Now that I am thinking about it, no one knew that I was here in château Dugibier. I got the contract on the way here and the advance is supposed to be sent to my bank account yesterday. Except that there is no way to verify my account without the internet. Come to think of it, I don't even have a network to call my bank or anyone. I was trapped. A sickening feeling of dread washed over me. How did I end up in this situation?\n\nAround 9 p.m. we could hear a helicopter landing in the château's backyard. It could be a late guest. After a few moments, Simon came over to the kitchen to tell me that the guests were very pleased with the menu served to them during lunch. Although the compliment should have made me feel proud, for some inexplicable reason, it had the opposite effect. All I wanted to do at this moment was finish this feast and go home.\n\n\"They want to meet you and congratulate you personally. Mr. Dugibier sent me to invite you to the grand salon.\" \"I'm afraid I can't, Simon. We're in the middle of preparation, and I've got some things in the oven.\" \"Mr. Dugibier insists. It wouldn’t take long.\" I know how much clients and guests enjoy talking to the chef during feasts like this one. It's almost like a ritual. I just can't seem to get away from it. So, after the beet brownies planned for dessert were done, I went with Simon.\n\nThe grand salon was on the first floor. I could hear women giggling from the room as we passed through the entryway. Simon opened the door for me, and I found myself in one of the most sumptuous French salons I'd ever seen. The walls were wallpapered in a luxurious red burgundy, adorned with golden motifs from the ceiling to the floor. While a soft light created a welcoming atmosphere, a strong smell of cigars filled the room. When I walked into the room, all the conversations came to a halt and everyone turned toward me.\n\n\"Ah! Here she is!\" Mr. Dugibier was beaming and cheering. His eyes were filled with a strange delight. \"Isn't that Miss Allie? Finally, we are overjoyed to meet with you.\"A tall bearded man with a British accent spoke up. \"Thank you, sir. It was my pleasure.\"I wasn't expecting such a warm welcome. \"Oh, my goodness, the lunch was delicious! That duck gizzard bruschetta with fig jam and goat cheese... mmm... delicious! And the unbelievable pistachio pesto and walnut purée. Absolutely divine!\" Said an elderly woman, sitting on an armchair and holding a golden cigarette holder in her veined hands. \"I hope you enjoyed the meal, Madame.\" The guests were still looking at me… smiling. I'm not sure why, but it made me feel very uneasy.\n\n\"Let us make a toast,\" Mr. Dugibier said to his guests. \" Simon, please bring a glass for Miss Allie.\" Simon went to the cabinet against the opposite wall and got a glass for Mr. Dugibier who poured Champagne into it and handed it to me. He then raised his glass in a toast while everyone stood up and raised theirs. \"Au gibier!\"exclamed Mr Dugibier. \"Au gibier!\" exclaimed everyone at once. I took a sip of Champagne. Why did they say *gibier* and not Dugibier? I'm not fluent in French, but it struck me as odd that they toasted the game rather than the host.\n\n\"I noticed you were very interested in art this morning,\" Mr. Dugibier said as he approached the fireplace. \"I'd like to show you an interesting tapestry.\"\n\nHe pulled a sliding red rope to open a pair of curtains above the fireplace. A magnificent tapestry was revealed. This one depicted a hunting scene in the woods with a man standing on a reddish hill and aiming a crossbow. I had to take a step back to see the entire tapestry. The hunter, dressed in an old-style attire, resembled the one I saw on the château gates yesterday. My gaze searched for the prey he was after. It was running through the woods on its hind legs. What? I had to pinch my eyes shut to make sure it was on two legs of prey. To my horror, it was not an animal. I gasped. It was a naked man with tanned skin like the ones in the other tapestries. My gaze then returned to the hunter. When I realized he wasn't standing on a hill, but on human corpses, I shuddered. Is this a hallucination? I returned my enquiring gaze to Mr. Dugibier, who was staring at me with an unsettled grin.\n\n\"The Dugibier family sigle,\" Mr. Dugibier said, holding the champagne in his hand and pointing to the tapestry. \"See Miss Allie, the Dugibier did not become wealthy by selling wood and coal. They are a very old lineage of hunters who emerged from the old continent. They organized hunting parties all over the world for Europe's nobles and aristocrats for centuries. However, it was during the conquest of the Americas that they did thrive. Why do you think wealthy Europeans wanted to relocate to an unknown land in the first place? For spices and beautiful landscapes?\"He chuckled.\n\n\"Wh... What does it all mean?\" I was horrified, shocked, and perplexed all at once. When I returned my gaze to the guests, I was surprised to see that they were all still standing and staring at me with the same unsettling grin. \n\nI've got to get out of here!\n\n\"It was for new prey.\"Mr. Dugibier's voice startled me. \"Our favorite prey were your ancestors, Aquetzalli.\" \n\n\"What… \" I began, but the terrifying realization slammed into me like a bucket of ice water. They were toasting to the *gibier*, to the prey, to… me. I started feeling numbness in my feet and hands. I stood there watching as the champagne glass slipped from my grasp and shattered on the floor. The last thing I saw was Mr. Dugibier sipping from his glass and grinning as he watched me fall.\n\nI woke up in a state of dizziness. Slowly, I opened my eyes halfway. Even though it was dark, I could see that I was lying on the ground. It was cold and smelled like pines. I could hear the sound of nocturnal insects. Where am I? A sudden owl hoot caused me to fully open my eyes and fall to my knees. I looked frantically around and realized I was in the middle of the woods. It was as if my mind was plunged into a fog. The last thing I could remember was someone grinning as I fell to the ground. It was a vicious triumphant grin. Mr. Dugibier! The tapestry… the hunter and the corpses piled on his feet! My stomach churned at the sudden memory. They drugged me and abandoned me in the middle of the woods. But why? A part of me was in denial and wanted all this to be just a bad dream. But in the back of my mind, I knew the answer. They didn't say anything in the grand salon, but it was obvious that this was a manhunt.\n\nI stood up in a hurry and examined my clothes. I was dressed in the same outfit I wore this morning, except for my cooking apron. I rummaged through my pockets looking for my phone. Shit! I had left my it in the kitchen before going to the grand salon. Wait… My Apple Watch! I bent down and patted my right ankle. It was still there. They didn't notice it. I quickly removed the watch and placed it on my wrist. It was 3 a.m.\n\nThere was no signal here. Shit shit shit! What am I to do?\n\nI took another look around. I was in a clearing that was lit by a half-moon. I held my breath for a few seconds so I could hear what was going on around me. All I could hear were owls hooting and muffled animal sounds. What if there are wolves or bears around? What if I was being watched?\n\nSuddenly it was so hard to breathe. My heart was pounding and my muscles tensed. I was beginning to panic. Terrifying scenarios were racing through my head. I need to focus.\n\nThink Allie! Think quickly!\n\nMy Workoutdoors app! It must have been synchronized with my iPhone when I downloaded the map to the château. It should work even offline. I run through the apps and found it. All I could see on the map were miles of forest and a mountain in the distance. But there are no roads or towns nearby. Shit Shit Shit!\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nShould I wait until day breaks or run for my life right now? The forest was dark and unsettling. I couldn’t see through the trees and it was dangerous to run in the dark. I could break my ankle or fall and get injured.\n\nCome on Allie, make a decision. Now!\n\nI looked down at my watch for a moment before beginning to write. I'm not sure if I'll make it, but everyone must know what happened to me at Château Dugibier.",

        "text": "He came with the property; like mould in the corner of a damp room or the fat little mouse in your kitchen cabinet. He was the most permanent sort of fixture; an uneasy assemblage of particles that was attached with atomic glue to the asphalt drive attached to my lovely two bed Victorian home. I don’t really know where to start, for the story of the man on my driveway is long and sprawling. I’m only an amateur writer so perhaps it is best to start at the beginning. \n\nI was a young professional, just graduated with a low-paid but aspirational role at an accountancy firm in Glasgow. I was newly single after my girlfriend of five years split up with me, and let me just say I was not ready to mingle. I wanted somewhere peaceful and in a nice neighbourhood to relax. When I saw it on Zoopla, I couldn’t believe my luck; a beautiful red brick Victorian, semi-detached, off street parking and a garage too, all packaged in a lovely, albeit gentrified, street in the East End for well within my limited budget. To say I nearly broke my leg leaping for the phone to call the real-estate agency would be an understatement. \n\nSo desperate I was for the property that I made a rookie error. I put in an offer without even stepping foot in the place. In my defence, the housing market is crazy and good deals don’t stick around forever. My offer was accepted and to my surprise there was no chain and the current owners were rather keen to move out quickly. Before I could even think to scope out the place I had the keys in my hand - beautiful big brass things that looked to be from a different era. \n\nI remember that first day at my property as clearly as I remember that drunken night where I lost control of my bowels in front of an entire nightclub - that is to say, I remember it with disturbing clarity. I arrived early in the morning with a suitcase and a rented truck driven by my rather bashful elder brother who had agreed to help me move in exchange for a bottle of expensive rum. \n\nI was confused at first when I saw the old and battered Volkswagen camper sprawled across my beautiful brick-layed drive. It wasn’t like the volkswagen campers you see on pinterest, beautifully restored and pastel, no this one was matte grey and the paint was peeling off in great big swathes. At the edges of the vehicle orange rust spread like mushroom spores. Cardboard was propped up against smashed windows and the tires looked flatter than a can of four day old pepsi.\n\n“Looks like they ain’t moved out yet Mike.” Harry leant out the truck window his cigarette hanging from his mouth, plumes of smoke rose to make little grey clouds above my head. I could see my neighbours peeping out of their windows and could almost hear the creaking of their blinds. I felt as though I was in a theatre performance. \n\nI slowly approached the Volkswagen with uncertainty and I heard a raspy cough. I crooked my head around to the driver’s seat half-expecting to find a set of apologetic home-owners with moving boxes in hand, instead I saw him, Alph. \n\n“Hi there.” He said casually in his gruff voice, as if he was speaking to customer service. I cocked an eyebrow. He was dishevelled, his beard so long he had tied it into a rough little knot that seemed to be matted solid. I could smell him even from five metres away; a putrid mix of cat litter tray and rotten cabbage. He had mysterious eyes, yet I could not quite decide then if they were kind or cruel. \n\n“Can I help you?” I asked.\n\n“I’d help you with the boxes but my knees give me some bother.” He shuffled awkwardly. The side door of the camper was slightly ajar and I could see inside, the sheets were brown and stained and rubbish and debris were piled up nearly up to the ceiling of the vehicle. “I live here by the way, the name’s Alph. You got a Mrs, any little ones?”\n\nI shook my head thinking the question was rather odd. “No, no wife or kids. I’m sorry sir but you-” \n\nA look of relief washed across his apprehensive face. It looked as though the weight of the world had been lifted from his shoulders. “Good, no kids, no wife, just perfect.” He interrupted. My ears were getting red and hot.  \n\n“You can’t live here - there has to be some sort of mistake - I just bought this property and this is my drive. You have to move your van right now.” I tried to sound as authoritative as I could but puberty hadn’t deepened my voice all that much, I imagined I sounded like a dissatisfied chipmunk. \n\n“No can do sir, no can do. I got squatter's rights and besides you don’t want me to leave.” He stood up on his wobbly knees and stumbled towards me. The putrid stench of him became so overwhelming that all my anger shrivelled up into disgust. He looked like he needed a walking stick to me, if not a wheelchair. “I got a job to do here sir, I won’t be a bother.” \n\nA job? I thought him a madman. The truth was anything but. \n\nHe was right about squatter’s rights. After I’d moved all my stuff into the house and plugged in my computer I set to work googling to find out my options whilst Harry shared a cigarette with my new uncomfortably close neighbour outside with a bemused grin on his devious face. As it turns out it would take some time to vanquish Alph from my drive, the police would have to issue an eviction notice first which could take at a minimum three months. It would have been easier if he had been illegally parked on the street. \n\n“Well you’re stuck with him for now. He’s not so bad, I mean the stench sure but… just been talking to him, he’s Celtic man so it could be worse, could be a Ranger’s fan.” Harry chuckled having reappeared in the kitchen stinking of tobacco. \n\n“Do you think I care what bloody football team he supports?” I hissed. “It’s going to take at least three months to rid myself of him. It's a hassle, but you're right. Could be worse.\"\n\nI told myself, just three months. When I thought about it harder and considered how cheap the property was, it suddenly felt like no time at all.\n\nAs well as calling the police I contacted my real estate agent. The mystery quickly deepened as according to my solicitor the sellers had never reported any trespass in spite of Alph’s claim that he had been there for years. This led me to a very confusing hypothesis that they had let him stay. Maybe they were Christians, you know the sort, the preachy ones that can't do anything remotely stern for fear of hellfire.\n\n“Howdy neighbour!” Alph accosted me one day when I was leaving for work. He was sat on the step of his camper with a pipe in his mouth. “The police served me an eviction notice this morning. Look I’m not angry with you lad, I know this setup is bizarre, but I come with this property, you’ll come to understand that before the three months is up.”\n\nOne night I heard some talking from out on my drive. It was Alph. I creaked open the windows and saw him burning something leafy around the perimeter of my house. He saw me looking and in the dead of that cold night we made slow untrusting eye contact. Sleep did not come easily after that.\n\nThings kept getting stranger. One of the nosey neighbours across the street grabbed me as I walked down the cul-de-sac with a bag of shopping. Her name was Mrs Holland, a little old lady who was as much a fixture on the street as Alph, her house had been passed down through numerous generations of her family.\n\n“How are you settling in deary? Alph isn’t giving you much bother is he?” She mused knowingly. She spoke with poorly concealed whimsy and didn’t give me time to respond. “The neighbourhood watch has been trying to get him out for years but they won’t. He’s a fixture. I hope he’s going easy on you.” \n\n“How long has he been here?” I asked her softly, slowing my pace to walk beside her.\n\n“Oh, fifty years. Give or take. I knew him when he lived in the house dear, he moved in after that archaeologist commited suicide.” She mused.\n\n“A murder - and Alph - He, he lived inside?” \n\n“Oh yes. With his wife, lovely thing. She used to make big muffins the size of loaves of bread. After she was gone, he lost everything, had to sell the house and ended up on the drive in that tatty old van. The house has been a revolving door since, though no one ever manages to get Alph to leave.” She explained with a casual tone. “Now if you don’t mind dear I’ve got a shepherd’s pie in the oven.” \n\nHe had lived inside the house with a wife once. The fates of time had conspired and he had ended up on the driveway watching on as other families claimed the house that had once been his. It didn't make any sense to me. When tragedy strikes you move away, you don't stay. \n\nExcept, sometimes you do. \n\nNot only that but there was the matter of the archaeologist who had killed himself in that very same home. The house that had been my dream was slowly becoming a nightmare.\n\n\"I heard you used to live inside the house.\" I paused to ask Alph one day. \n\n\"I did, Mrs Holland tell you I s'pose? What else she tell you? About my wife, my wife and child?\" His voice cracked when he mentioned his family. It struck me then, as misery wounded his face, that he must have had a wrinkle for ever year of life. \n\n\"Just your wife, I didn't know there was a child. Said she made muffins.\" I conversed.\n\n\"The best muffins. Never had any since.\" He grumbled. \"Both of them are buried at that cemetery up the road. Can't get down to see them much, what with these knees and the bloody engine in this rust trap is caput.\"\n\n\"I could take you.\" The words came before I could consider what I was offering, a kindness to the man who was making my life a big giant ball of stress. \"If you want that is.\"\n\n\"You would?\" His eyes lit up as though kindness was a foreign concept. \n\nHe dressed up for the occasion, ripped a flower out of my flowerbeds and slipped it into his suit pocket. I considered putting plastic wrap down on my seats to protect them from the stench, but I couldn't bring myself to. However Alph had wronged me; he was human and I didn't want to wound him with petty insults.\n\nTheir graves were under the shadow of a willow tree. Catherine and Alfred, aged twenty-four and 4 days. I watched Alph kneel from a few feet away, far enough to obscure his face, but close enough to hear him say. \"I'm keeping watch sweetheart. I'll never stop.\"\n\nHe placed the flower from my flowerbed and paused for a small moment, as if the weight of the world sat perched on his rounded shoulders. \n\n\"Thank you.\" He said to me. \n\nI woke up the next morning to a bottle of fancy beer on my doorstep. \n\nVery soon Alph became a fixture I said hello to on the way to work. The perpetual smell of stagnant water and tobacco ceased to bother me. The three months were nearly up when another problem arrived to replace the one I was very nearly free of. \n\nThere was mould in the loft. \n\nAwful thick black mould, I considered getting in a professional to fix it but the prices were eye watering. It was a strange mould, it was more like black moss and you had scrape it as opposed to wipe. It was only in the smallest bedroom, a rather beautiful room with a circular window with elegant brass tracery. In another time it might have been a nursery, I wondered if Alph's son had spent his four short days there.\n\nI took matters into my hands and bought industrial grade mould remover. Alph was cooking sausages on his camping stove when he saw me drag in the bucket of remover. \n\n\"The mould starting? In the little room with the nice window. You won't stop it with that you know. She's a stubborn wench.\" He grunted. \n\n\"Any advice?\"\n\n\"Pazuzu might help, if ya ask nicely.\" He shuffled his shoulders with a low laugh. I filed that away in the ever-growing part of my brain where I stored all the odd things that Alph said.\n\nHe was right about one thing. The mould spray did nothing, in fact it antagonised it. The mould grew further and further out of the wall, it's black tendrils reaching out towards the empty space in the centre of the room. I was about to call in the professionals after all, when I went through one day and saw that it had almost taken on the shape of a figure. \n\nIt had the proportions of a woman. A feign of light or an illusion, I convinced myself. In the quiet apprehension of horror I thought I saw it move.\n\n\"She'll get bigger you know, she'll be unhappy she's nothing to take.\" Alph said one day as I left for work. \"There's nightmares too, isn't there. Deserts, empires of ash?\"\n\nThere had been nightmares, and just as he had described, a desert with orange sands, a strange rotted carcass that resembled something only barely human and a man brushing the dust from the cracks in it's black tar bones. \n\n\"He brought her back. The man who was in there before me.\" Alph's voice was layered in cryptic mystery.\n\n\"Brought who back Alph?\" \n\n\"She'll get tired of you soon, like she did of him. She doesn't like to eat men.\"\n\nI thought he was going even more senile than he usually was. I ignored him for the last time. I returned with a mould removal servce. The gruff professional dragged his tools up the stairs and when he opened the door to the nursery room, his brows twisted in confusion.\n\n\"Where's the mould mate?\"\n\nThe mould, It was gone.\n\nThere's an animalistic side to all of us - one we don't realise we have until it's triggered. I felt it then, an overwhelming feeling of dread that built up to a crescendo where the very utterance of silence rang in my ears like alarm bells. I ought to have listened to it. \n\nI went to bed that night with that feeling still tugging at me. Sleep did not come easy, in fact it did not come at all. My eyes narrowed from exhaustion, my room almost pitch black save for the small amount of light from my phone screen. I thought it was the silhouette of a jacket at first. I stared hard at it, trying to discern any familiarity in it's shape.\n\nI stared for what felt like hours and I felt as though I was being watched, like I wasn't alone. Then it came. Just the smallest of twitches. My finger danced over the torch button on my phone, but there was a comfort in not seeing, in the dark haze there was still a chance that it was my jacket or an odd shadow. \n\nIt moved again, this time more decisively. And again, and again and always closer. I couldn't move. I was stuck still like someone had hit my pause button. \n\nI screamed.\n\nI know it's silly, I'm a grown man and rather than fight or flee my instinct had been to screech at the top of my lungs. But let me tell you I was lucky I did, for that seemed to scare the thing off. \n\nI didn't sleep that night, I blanketed the house in so much light, Alph must have saw. He came to my door with more of that fancy beer he must have stolen.\n\n\"The first night you see her is a tough one. This makes it better.\" Alph passed me the beer. \"I do my rituals, that keeps her at bay most of the time. If you send me away she'll get closer and closer. She shouldn't hurt you. She doesn't eat men usually, the archaeologist before me was an exception. Musta pissed her right off.\"\n\n\"You're crazy.\" I muttered.\n\n\"Then so are you.\" \n\nI called off the eviction, mainly for the peace of mind as I was still frightened from that night. I tried to sell. It was easier said than done. It turns out no one wants to buy a house with a mould problem and a mad man on the drive. \n\nI finally got a viewing, a lovely family of four so desperate for a property that they were willing to embrace the three month eviction process and the now quite extensive mould problem. \n\nI told Alph to be on his best behaviour for my viewers, he agreed until he saw them. The wife was pregnant again and had her one-year old on her hip. I saw his eyes go glassy and then, turn more determined. I sighed into my hands. \n\n\"Yaba Baba huba booooba. I curse you and your children!\" Alph yelled at the woman. He squatted on the drive, pulled down his trousers and to everyone's disgust and horror took a massive dump on the drive.\n\nNeedless to say the family left with no intent of buying.\n\n\"I'm sorry Mike. No women or kids. I'd rather you than them, no hard feelings.\" Alph shuffled back to his van. He was careful to avoid the fecal matter. \"I'll clean that later.\"\n\nI was angry, I followed him back to the van in a haze of fury. \n\n\"What happened to your family, why are you here? If I'm to be stuck here then I must know.\" I hissed at him. Alph seemed taken aback but had more composure than me, he patted the space next to him in the van. I ignored the scent of urine and sat next to him.\n\n\"The house was going cheap when I bought it. An archaeologist had it before me. Killed himself. Had to clean the bloodstains myself. Me and Cat moved in here with a dream - a lovely little family, a nice garden. You know, the usual. T'wasn't to be.\" Alph grumbled. \"Then the mould started but it wasn't your usual mould, it was alive, it was her. Lamashtu.\"\n\n\"L-Lamashtu?\"\n\n\"She who devours. The most ancient and foulest of demons. The archaeologist that was here before me, he was doing a dig in Iran, brought back loads of artefacts for the museum. I think he dug her up, released her, brought her back here.\" Alph's voice had the lilt of a madman. I thought back to that night, to the moving mould in the corner of my room and for a moment he sounded sane. \n\n\"But your family, what happened to them?\"\n\n\"Women and babies, that's who she likes to eat. It's all in here, everything that happened.\" Alph handed me a tatty leather bound book. \"I have to stay, keep her from getting out of the house. It was my promise to my Cat.\"\n\n\"You're crazy.\" I resisted.\n\n\"I wish I was, but Mike, one more thing.\" Alph chased after me as I stood to leave. \"There are gods and demons, that much I know to be true. You do to, what you saw that night. They're all around us and move silently, they watch and hear and eat. They're spores.\"",

At a very young age I understood that happiness and success are two different values, therefore being two different thing’s. But for some this can be a bit difficult to understand, let alone achieve.\n\nMy mother had always taught me when I was a young girl that I had to always work for what I had wanted. And that things took time to come together and work for me.\n\nMy mother used to always say;\n\n“After all sweetheart, before things work for you, you have to understand it, so you have to work for it.”\n\nI always took my mothers words at face value when I was a kid. But now being this version of me that has went through what I had went through..well, let’s just say those words stick with me, more now than ever before.\n\nCurrently, I am 22 years old. Yeah I know, I’m in my golden years of life. Normally, anyone else my age would be building themselves up. Maybe having a significant other or in college, hell they’re probably even starting a family. But not me, no not me.  I’m stuck going to therapy twice a week and having to stay inside because I’m too scared to leave the house anymore. Drowning myself in emotional pain, prescription drugs and regret. And the worst part of it is, is that I lie to myself. I lie to myself and I tell myself every single time.\n\nI always tell myself that I’m fine and that I will get better. And it’s not that I don’t want to either, it’s only due to the fact that I can’t.\nI can’t move past that point in my life.\nI can’t move past that decision that I made more than over two years ago.\n\nI try every single day to do so. But something is blocking me, as if wanting me to relive that feeling, wanting me to painstakingly relive that moment each waking day.\n\nMy therapist tells me that I should continue  documenting my thoughts out in my journal when I can or at the very least record them. I chose the ladder. I figured that speaking my mind and giving her some room to breathe and just get into my mind..it gives me a sense of ease is what I’m trying to say here. A sense of peace knowing that someone hears me.\n\nGrowing up I never had someone there to listen. My therapist has told me this is why I’m so depressed and antisocial. The idea of not being heard has subconsciously crawled out from the womb of my childhood, down the legs that are my ears and into the crevices of the mouth of irony that is my mind.\n\nWhat is the irony? Well, that’s simple. Despite not necessarily “wanting” to be heard. I’ve become fond of the idea of such. I guess at the end of the day we’re all human, isn’t that right? Yes, I-I think that’s the truth..\n\nI was only 19 years old when I went out to the lodges with my ex-girlfriend. Her name \nwas Fall. Oh, Such a lovely person she was.\nIt’s funny because I never believed in those superstitious love stories that people spoke so fondly of.\nThis was mostly due to the fact that I had never experienced love. At least not in a traditional sense, unfortunately.\n\nI was ignorant and afraid. Much like any child, and one night when dealing with my boyfriend and his overly aggressive pleasures at the time. Fall who was his girlfriend at the time, freed me from those emotions. And more importantly of his aggression.\nIt was swift and it was fast. It all happened in the blink of an eye. Like lightning striking down from the heavens. And before you have time to even process it it’s gone.\n\nIt was a few weeks before my birthday.\nFall had wanted to surprise me for the holiday season. But I knew that deep down she had wanted to free herself of burden. \nJust as much as I wanted to free myself of the knowledge and knowings of truth. Truth about what happened the weeks prior. We had to get away, we had to remove ourselves. It was a must.\n\nAnd if you ask me if I regret it. Well then to that I’d say. That I’d rather runaway from my issues in a sense of leaving the burden in the sea. Rather than facing them under the idea that they might drown me in the process.\n \nUpon our arrival to the lodge.\nI could feel the cool sting that was brewing in the air. Perfectly matched and mixed with the white coat layered gently across crusted surface.\nI remember seeing that lodge for the first time and upon baring witness to what had seemed like something truly beautiful and comforting. Somewhere were all of my problems and issues would seemingly go away at the clinch of the front door handle..I don’t know how to explain it, but despite the overwhelming sense of comfortability, something just seemed off.",

        "text": " \n\n467 B.C. - The sun was setting upon *“inkwi”*, an island once located near the Caribbean … \n\nI don’t remember the exact date as to when it all took place , but if I recall correctly I believe I was 7 years old and I was hunting with Araf , my father . We were out at sunrise hunting deer and small birds. My father was an expert in the art of hunting unlike me who ran aimlessly in hopes of catching a stupid bird . By the time dusk set in , we started to gather all our hunting equipment in order to return to our little cabin in the center of town . On our way back through the dense forest , filled with trees with orange and yellow leaves and small critters looking for their next meal , I looked straight up ,  and in the midst of all that orange ,  I could see black and purple dots scattered across the sky .\n\nThis went on for the next  5 years , each year the dots grew bigger in size  and unlike my first encounter with them where they all seemed so distant from one another , with each passing day they seemed to unite with each other , their presence becoming stronger and more threatening .\n\n468 B.C. - It wasn’t only the particles anymore , it was the soft heartbeat sounds that could be heard each time a particle grew larger in size or connected to another one. By this point , everyone was talking about the strange phenomenon that had invaded our little island and demanding answers from our town counselors such as my father . It didn’t take much longer until the fear and hatred started to consume my neighbors , as the particles had reached a point where parts of the sun were being completely blocked during parts of the day and there were still no answers .  Many of our neighbors started throwing rocks at our windows and many of the town kids would beat me up whenever they saw me leave the house . It got to a point where enough was enough and my father called everyone in for a town meeting in which he stated the reality we were all facing and how at this rate we should prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario : total darkness. \n\nAfter that day , we couldn’t manage to leave our house anymore , as the threat of our entire family being hanged or burned alive by our neighbors was always present.\n\n470 B.C. - No one was getting sleep anymore , the noises kept intensifying and our biggest fears were  starting to turn into a reality . The particles had now blocked nearly the entire \n\nSky and we could now clearly see the formation of a black hole surrounded in its entirety by a flashing purple glow. I was fascinated by the imposing behemoth and would spend hours just looking at it ,imagining all the possibilities as to what it may contain and why it came to visit our little town .\n\nLittle did I know that it wouldn’t take long until I found the answers to all my questions…\n\n472 B.C. - I was sitting on the front porch of our little cabin when it all went down …\n\nThe black hole started spinning at a speed never seen before ! During this stage , a gust of wind ferociously attacked our side of town , yanking the branches off nearby trees and carrying all sorts of sharp debris along with it. I covered my face with my hands , trying to grab something to hold onto and then suddenly , a loud explosion could be heard from the “eye” of the void ! I screamed in terror  and quickly jumped to my feet! \n\nI yanked the door open and screamed for everyone to abandon the house immediately , my parents grabbed our siblings by the arms and rushed them out of the cabin. I looked to my sides and could see dozens of my neighbors exiting their homes , some were running to the mountains and others were trying to find a place to hide , but we went straight for the woods…\n\nWe ran for a long time while constantly hearing a hoard of footsteps trailing behind us , they were catching up . I knew we could only keep this up for so long until they would finally find us but I didn’t care . My mind was so concentrated on escaping that I was startled when I heard my mothers scream in the distance. I took a glance behind me but I couldn’t see anything. The only thing I could hear was a loud explosion nearby ,followed by a dreadful moment of silence . I stopped dead in my tracks as the realization that my family was gone hit me . I fell to the ground , ripped my shirt apart and started to cry inconsolably. I layed in the dirt for a long time until I heard the sound of footsteps quickly approaching…\n\n I JOLTED STRAIGHT UP AND MADE A RUN FOR IT , DASHING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS THE TREES , JUMPING AND DUCKING ACROSS THEM .I NOTICED THAT THE VOID WAS ABDUCTING EVERYTHING IN IT WAY AND WAS COMING DIRECTLY FOR ME ! I RAN EVEN FASTER UNtiL mY LeGS fInAlly GaVE OuT AnD EVERything WEnt BLacK…\n\n***I had been abducted by them…***\n\nI don’t know how much time had passed until I woke up ,  but when I did , I realized I was far from home , somewhere foreign. The terrain was purplish and very rocky and an odd smell emanated from something nearby. Once I stood up I found where it was coming from.\n\nThey were completely black , had purple glowing eyes and a ton of spikes from the top of their head all the way to their tails , they are known as the “Eliotropi”. They grabbed me by the arms and led me down a long trail filled with sharp alien rocks and gross parasites and alien bird-like creatures that inhabited the area . After a long and painful walk we finally made it to our destination …\n\nA massive palace-like structure , black and purple were its colors . I looked to my sides and could see spaceships landing all around me . They opened their doors and I was shocked to see kids just like me, some looked younger, some looked older , but none of them were adults . The Eliotropi stopped me at the steps of the palace and I waited as the kids from the other spaceships arrived at the palace steps . When everyone had finally made it there , I took a glance behind me and I saw hundreds of kids piled up with one another , some were crying but most of them were in complete shock, not yet having processed the reality of their situation  . We climbed up the stairs until I came face to face with a giant red metal door. When it opened I was completely blinded by the darkness of the room . All I could hear were the words of the Eliotropi :\n\n———————————————————————————————————————\n\nEliotropi 1 : “ General X, the invasion on Earth was a success ! We have bought what you have demanded of us.”\n\nGeneral X \\*laughs\\* “How delightful… Don’t waste anymore time and proceed to give them all to the people!”\n\nEliotropi 2 “ Finally , I've been hungry for a while ! ”\n\nGeneral X “ Yes , Yes , calm down! Before you leave, do me a favor and separate a couple of them from the group and bring them to me . I think it's about time …”\n\n———————————————————————————————————————-\n\nSuddenly two groups were made , most of the kids were piled into one group but I was placed into a much smaller group of about 20 kids . I looked to my left and my right in fear  as I saw two doors emerge from the walls , they slowly opened , and we were taken in .\n\nWe walked down a long corridor until we came across another door . This one was completely golden and had purple cracks all around it . I went in and I was finally able to see him ! Sitting in the throne was General X , he wore a neo-samurai helmet and a tattered cape along his back . He got up from his throne and spoke : \n\n*The following is a dialogue between the Eliotropi and General X moments before the transformation:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\nEliotropi 1 , 2 &amp; 3  : “ These were the best we could find your honor!”\n\nGeneral X: “Perfect …  After centuries of studying humanity these seem to be the perfect test subjects for the treiglad trials !”\n\nEliotropi 2 : “ B- but it’s too dangerous !”\n\nEliotropi 3: “ He’s completely right ! If something goes wrong our entire species runs the risk of becoming extinct !”\n\nGeneral X “ Well there’s only one way of finding out.”\n\nEliotropi 2&amp;3 : “ BUT!!!”\n\nGeneral X “ Be quiet and get out!!!”\n\n————————————————————————————————————-\n\nMoments later , I along with 2 other kids were separated from the rest of the group. We were forced to retrace our path until we finally came across a shiny grey metal door that I hadn’t taken notice of before . The soldier pushed us aside , grabbed a key out of his pocket and opened it . We walked down the stairs until we made it into a room that contained 3 giant glass chambers. I STARTED TO PANIC AT THAT MOMENT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THESE SAVAGES , I SCREAMED IN PROTEST TRYING TO LET MYSElF FREE FROM THE CHAINS I HAD TIED TO ME , but it was useless…\n\nThat was the last thing I could remember from that day . When I finally woke up , I could see I  was still chained up and was floating in a sea of purple acid . I looked around me and that’s when I saw my reflection. I looked completely different , my skin was dark and its texture was rough , my eyes were glowing purple and spikes started to protrude from my arms , legs and back . \n\nMoments later , 5 Eliotropi showed up , they unlocked my chamber and removed the chains I had tied up to me. I looked to my sides and saw that one of the two remaining chambers was also being unlocked . I watched in awe as the creature emerged from the chamber . It was massive and was covered with messy dark-silver fur that ran from the top of its head all the way to the bottom of its feet , it also had massive dark gray feathers like that of a “Lammergeier”. The real horror came when it started to flap its wings aggressively at the Eliotropi and opened its mouth , to reveal thousands of squirming worms in the place where teeth should have been  , the Eliotropi acted quickly and injected it with a tranquilizer that made it fall to the ground , leaving it in a dormant state . Moments later I heard slow footsteps approaching the chamber , I looked behind me and caught sight of General X . He signaled me to follow him and I did , we exited the chamber and walked until we arrived at a spiral staircase leading into the palace’s balcony .\n\nOnce we had finally made it there ,  he made his way to the front of the balcony and addressed the Eliotropi :\n\n———————————————————————————————————\n\n***GX : “Welcome everyone !***\n\n***\\*The crowd cheers\\****\n\n***GX: Yes , Yes , I know all of you are very happy now that you have filled your stomachs after centuries of awaiting your next meal , BUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS REUNION IS NOT TO CELEBRATE OUR VICTORY , BUT RATHER, TO WELCOME A NEW MEMBER TO OUR FAMILY!!*** \n\nIt was at this moment where the Eliotropi holding me back , finally let me go , I walked to the front of the balcony and proceeded to look down below me. I was shocked to see thousands of Eliotropi all gathered at around the palace steps. GX then proceeded to hand me a cape along with a helmet just like his and continued with his speech.\n\n***GX: PLEASE WELCOME “UDUMEES”, COMMANDER IN CHIEF , THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL TEST  SUBJECT TO THE “TREIGLAD TRIALS***”!\n\n\\*Crowd cheers and applauds\\* \n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\nThat was 2495 years ago ,\n\nAfter that day , I learned many things about the “Newel” kingdom ,  but out of all the teachings one stood out to me the most and that was the one relating to the invasion on planet earth. Here is what it stated :\n\n“Every 2500 earth years , we serve the right and consider  it to be our responsibility to invade earth in order to preserve all the life and order present in “Newel ”. 5 years before our arrival a “Nimbus” will form in the sky , it will progressively get stronger as the years go on , once it reaches its final stage a portal will form in the sky which will allow us to enter earth with ease . During the invasion we will take with us as much of humanity deemed necesary in order to preserve our population alive . ANY DISRUPTIONS TO OUR ACTIVITY WILL RESULT IN FATAL CONSEQUENCES TO THE INDIVIDUALS AND TO THE COSMOS AS WE KNOW IT. ”.   You may choose to do what you wish with this information , regardless of your final decision just remember that time is running out and for that -\n\n“We are sorry”",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10n9yml/were_not_like_the_others/)\n\nWe took your advice. I wish we never did.\n\n...\n\nRyuk came by again today. Someone suggested we stop drinking whatever Ms. Devanna was feeding us in those bottles and we stopped.\n\nOn one hand, we did stop growing. On the other hand, both of us have been feeling sluggish, tired, and starved.\n\nI drank a small sip before pouring it down one crack in the floor. I noticed it aged me a little, but it satiated my hunger, too.\n\n\"We need to go back there. To figure out what's going on in that room. Whose those people are. And if they need our help.\" Ryuk suggested.\n\nI thought about it for a moment. I didn't really know if that was a good idea.\n\n\"Maybe we just let it go. I don't know if it will be safe. What if they catch us?\"\n\n\"Then we should escape.\"\n\nMy head fell to my chest, and I could feel the hunger burning in my stomach again. \"I don't know if we can survive without the food.\"\n\nHe threw his hands up, turning to the opposite wall. \"Then what are we supposed to do? We can't stay here. We don't know what they're going to do to us.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, I caught a slight movement in the corner of my eye. The curtain to the room moved back and forward, as if someone had just let it go.\n\nWhen I looked out into the hallway, no one was there.\n\n…\n\n\"Hey Nahom, how are you doing today?\" Ms. Devanna's voice calls from the doorway.\n\nWithout looking up from my book, I responded. \"I'm doing great. How are you doing?\"\n\n\"Good. I'm glad.\" She set the bottle down in front of me, but I kept my eyes focused on the book. \"Yeah, thank you. I'll finish this chapter and then I'll have some.\"\n\n\"I would like you to finish it now, actually. I just wanted to make sure that you've been eating. You seem like you've been tired. Please, drink it.\"\n\nI turned back to her, leaning into my seat. \"I'm not eating this. If you want me to eat it, you're going to have to force me.\"\n\nShe looked taken aback, and she stepped away towards the door. I stayed in my seat, watching her. She turned and ran out, not bothering to close the curtain.\n\nBefore leaving the room, I took a sip from the bottle. It filled my empty stomach a little before I pour the rest out.\n\nWhen I got to the door to the living room, it was locked. I quickly ducked below the window, pressing my ear up to the door. \n\nNormally it was hard to hear them, but the voices on the other side were yelling.\n\n\"What do you mean, they aren't eating it?\" A man's voice boomed, shaking the door.\n\n\"I mean, they haven't been eating it. They won't eat in front of me. And they stopped growing.\" I recognized Ms. Devanna's voice.\n\n\"Wait, what do you mean they stopped growing? They can't stop growing, right? How could they not be growing?\" This voice is a younger woman's, one whose voice I didn't recognize.\n\nI heard their voices come in my direction, and I quickly ran from the door. I couldn't make it to my room in time, so I quickly snuck into a different door. I pressed my back up against the door, trying to catch my breath.\n\n\"Nahom?\"\n\nI jumped.\n\n\"Ryuk? What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I told you. I'm trying to find out what's in that room. You said you didn't want to come so I decided to do it on my own. Why are you here? Changed your mind?\"\n\n\"Look, just hurry and try to get that lock open. They're looking for us. And they know we stopped drinking that drink.\"\n\nHe fumbled with the small paperclip in his hand before inserting it into the lock. After watching him for a few minutes, I heard a click.\n\nWe stared in horror as the door pushed open. Something that looked like an enormous spider, bigger than any human I've ever seen, suspended upside down in the center of the room. Each leg was strapped against the metal walls of the room. When it looked up, it saw us and screeched. I wanted to cover my ears, but I was shocked by its head. \n\nIt was the head of a woman.\n\n\"They're in here!\"\n\nA woman with red hair pulled the door open, grabbing Ryuk by the arm and pulling him back towards his room. He struggled against her, but he was took weak.\n\nMs. Devanna stood in the doorway, eyes looking into mine. She looked sad.\n\n\"I'm sorry Nahom, I didn't want you to see that.\"\n\n\"What is all of that? What is going on here? What are you doing to us?\"\n\nShe tilted her head back to the ceiling and she blinked a few times. Tears streamed down the sides of her face and she wiped them away on her wrist.\n\n\"It's a Shikari. It takes the DNA of the host bodies and creates perfect clones of them. The drink we've been feeding you is the food from the creature. Like mother's milk.\"\n\n\"Why is it chained up like that? What are you doing to it? Why are you making it do this?\"\n\nHer back slid down the wall, and she brought her arms up to her face. \"We needed to. To survive. We've been cloning them for years, ever since I was a child. We used the clones as meat. To feed our families that live here. My parents found the creature, and when they lost their jobs, they struggled to feed us and the creature. So they did all of this. To help feed their family and any other families that had fallen into desperate times.\"\n\nMy mouth fell open. But I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do. I didn't struggle as she led me back to my room.\n\n\"Do you want to drink it now?\"\n\n…\n\nWhen the others fell asleep, I could swipe the phone from my neighbor. But now I have no idea what to do, I don't understand what I am. \n\nWhat is going to happen if we do run? Can we survive outside on our own?\n\nAnd that spider creature... that thing. I couldn’t tell if it was trying to attack us or if it was trying to get us to help it.",

        "text": "Ever since I was very young, I've played this game with myself. I don't know where it came from, or why I continue to do it even though it's the furthest thing from \"fun\" that I can think of. But it's almost involuntary now. It's the only way I can get myself to fall asleep.\n\nEvery night, I wake up around midnight. The time varies, but it's almost always between 11:50 and 12:15. And it's probably a product of my over-reactive mind, but I always sense something.\n\nIt's hard to describe. It's not a sound, or a smell, or anything like that. It's just... a *presence*. I can feel it in my bones and in my brain. If you've ever had that horrible feeling that you're being followed or watched, the prickling on the back of your neck and the sudden heaviness in your gut, then you'll understand.\n\nBut I grew up in a dangerous neighborhood, and I've felt like that plenty of times. This is nothing like the rush of adrenaline and anxiety that comes from seeing a car slowly track you down several blocks before you hide inside your house. There is no safety for me anywhere, no house I could run to. Because I'm all alone... except for the Midnight Man.\n\n\\-\n\nIt starts like this: I wake up drenched in sweat, my mind foggy, and my eyes find the digital clock at my bedside with its bright, blocky orange numbers. I read the time, and I feel my heart sink.\n\nSimultaneously, he arrives.\n\nSuddenly, everything feels darker. The shadows deepen and widen until it feels like I'm swimming in a pool of dark matter. The room suddenly yawns wide, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole. And I feel him. The Midnight Man.\n\nHe walks through the house. I can't hear him, but I know he's there. I know what room he's in, and I know when he's close, when I have to arrange myself into a comfortable sleeping position, ignore the rapid pulsing of my heart, and close my eyes.\n\nI can't look. I can't look at him when he comes into the room, because if I do, something awful will happen. I don't know what. But it's going to be bad.\n\nI know the exact moment he appears in my room. I feel him there, standing in my doorway. His eyes fixed on me.\n\nHe doesn't move. He stays in the doorway, and he watches me sleep. I force myself to breathe evenly, my chest rising and falling. Underneath the sheets, my fists are clenched so tightly I worry that one day I'll break my fingers.\n\nTime seems slow. The air grows warmer, and disgustingly wet and viscous, like I'm surrounded by amniotic fluid. I can feel the room tilting, but of course that's impossible. This is all a game I play with myself every night. It's not real. It isn't *real*.\n\nFinally, he leaves. He makes his rounds through the rest of the house one more time, and then the pounding in my head and the senseless horror gripping me disappear. And I feel so tired. So tired.\n\nWhen I wake up, everything is normal.\n\n\\-\n\nI'm writing this now in my room. It's 11:44 PM, and I know he's going to show up soon. I'm praying to whatever deities are out there that he comes late today.\n\nLast night, he seemed to linger for much longer than usual. I could feel him walking around my room, rather than staying in the doorway. At one point, a tingling feeling ran through my entire body as if thousands of spiders were crawling over my skin, and I had to bite the inside of my cheek not to scream, to swallow down the bile rising in my throat.\n\nHe touched me. I know he did.\n\nOf course he didn't. I must be ill. My mind is working against me. It's just my stupid phobia getting to me.\n\nRight?\n\nHe left a sign today. I'm sure of it. I woke up and went to the bathroom to splash my sweaty neck with cold water, and in the sink I saw black mold flowering like some awful pustule, pushing its way through the drain. I leaned forward, disgusted, and it...it *changed*.\n\nDo you know the kaleidoscope-like feeling when you rub your eyes and thousands of tiny triangles dance behind your closed eyelids? That's exactly what it was like, but my eyes were open. It seemed to bloom, to open up, to deepen like a hole in the universe. It swirled with patterns, and suddenly I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.\n\nI lurched back and gripped my chest, but I had to lean over the toilet and vomit. It was hot, almost scorching as it passed my lips, and before I opened my eyes I was suddenly terrified that he was behind me. The Midnight Man.\n\nI started to tremble. I tasted coppery blood stinging my lips. I felt hot, then cold, wracked with shivers. Finally, I couldn't bear it and I had to whirl around.\n\nNothing.\n\nI hurried to the sink and peered inside. Gone. The mold was gone.\n\nHe was sending me a message, I'm sure of it. He's coming for me tonight.\n\n\\-\n\nI'm terrified. Even now I'm shaking and barely holding back sobs. I've never felt like this before; it's like a sickness. No one can help me, I have to deal with this alone. And this is why I'm writing it down, so if I disappear everyone knows where I've gone.\n\nI have to see him, just this once, even if it costs me my life. I can't live in fear anymore. I need to see him. I just need to—\n\n...\n\nHe's here. \n\nHe's coming for me.\n\nGod help me.",

        "text": "\r\n\r\nWinter in new York is a grey, wet, diesel reeking slog. 4 months of walking through snowstorms or cramming into packed subway cars that havn't figured out how to not smell like piss in 80 years. \r\n\r\nI chose the former, trying to pull my black suit jacket tighter to stave off the cold as I made my way to the squat, dilapidated VFW building. \r\n\r\nWe buried Eli earlier that day, small service, mostly old military friends, ( both literally and figuratively.) myself, and  the ancient Rabbi.\r\n\r\nBut this was where the real memorial was going to happen. \r\n\r\nI see some familiar faces, mostly folks I've crossed paths with during the course of my career or people that knew Eli long before me,. Back when he wasn't my best friend , but a top level medic patching up folks wounded on the type of special ops that the fate of the world hinges on. \r\n\r\nI see a familiar face, at one point in time the two of us were out for each other's heads. A rivalry that left me with half of my teeth as broken splinters, and her with a left pupil that never contracted, just to name the highlights.\r\n\r\nBut the only constant in life is change, over my 10 year career her, and her superiors have came to a strained kind of peace with Eli and myself. Out of all of the flamboyant psychos she works with, I actually respect her. \r\n\r\nShe's six and a half feet of bulk, built like a wrestler, her hair is short and black, sunglasses cover her eyes despite the grey gloom of the November afternoon. The long brown trench coat she wears flaps in the wind as she struggles to light a cigarette. \r\n\r\nShe notices me walk up, but not lift the pack of Marlboro Red's from her coat pocket, i take one, offering her her own cigarettes back with a smirk. \r\n\r\nShe curtly takes the pack, shaking her head, and in a moment of anger, throws her useless plastic lighter across the street. My zippo has less trouble, i light her cigarette, then mine as we stand there, silently. \r\n\r\nIt's not uncomfortable, just the easy interaction of two people who are closer than friends, or lovers. Two people who have had each other's lives in their hands, time and time again, and never decided to close their fist.\r\n\r\n\"He was a good man Mike, crazy, but a good guy.\" Sam says, taking a long drag snowflakes making the tobacco sizzle and pop. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\" I say, taking a shuddering breath. \r\n\r\nI've been crying in fits and starts all day, small, periodic breakdowns that never seem to put a dent in the tide of depression and rage that followed Eli's death. But i compose myself, stinging tears begining to well in my eyes. \r\n\r\n\"How are you taking it?\" She asks, her tone level, but her concern evident. \r\n\r\n\"You mean, personally, or professionally?\" I say, unintentionally sounding accusatory. \r\n\r\n\"Both, I guess. Not asking on the record, just asking.\" Sam lights another ciragette from the butt of the first before throwing it away. How she manages to wear a 200 pound suit of kevlar and strike plate in the field like it's cosplay gear, while puffing these coffin nails, i don't understand. \r\n\r\n\" I'm gutted, i jumped right the hell off the wagon, been on a 3 day bender, and I'm probably not going to stop until my puke is more blood than food. \r\n\r\nIf it wouldn't be spitting on what we were doing, I probably wouldn't be around any more to tell the truth. The guy survived the actual Nazis, all the crazy shit him and I did, not to mention everything in between, to be killed by what? A fucking blood clot. \" I shake my head, trying to stop the  free flowing tears,\" And as far as professionally? I should probably just pack it in. \r\n\r\nIt's been ten years, and I'm running on fumes, not just mentally either. If I listed you everything wrong with me, it'd sound like I was doing an old George Burns bit.\" \r\n\r\n\"But it's not like you go around immolating gang leaders and Jason Voorhees'ing violent Cults much anymore is it? That's why we like you, Mike, your reputation stops more violence than you committ. \r\n\r\nYou're sad, so am I, Eli was a legend, and you were closer to him than just about anyone. But life goes on, and you and I both know you are not going to move to Idaho and go back to being a birthday clown. \r\n\r\nFinish your bender, puke your blood, and get your shit together, please. \" her last sentence was spoken with more care and understanding than i could hope to convey with just words. She throws her second smoke away, walking into the building, i work up the courage to do the same a few minutes later, sitting at the back of the low ceilinged, wood-panelled meeting hall/bar as friends and fellow soldiers take it in turns to share old war stories, anecdotes and anything else they could think of relating to Eli. \r\n\r\nI stayed silent, after all, what could I add to the conversation? The things the old man and I got up to were not exactly meant to be shared with a crowd. \r\n\r\nThe speeches stop and the drinking starts, i feel more in my element as the booze starts to flow and those around me without a deep seated alcoholism start to get hammered. \r\n\r\nAs afternoon turns to evening the crowd thins, i try and leave, but just can't bring myself to do it. As stupid as it sounds, it feels like I'm walking away from Eli himself. \r\n\r\nSo I sit in the decades old folding chair, deep in my mind, my choices, both future and past….\r\n\r\n\"So here he is, the homo that's been taking advantage of my dad for ten years.\" the voice is like gravel, i know who it is only by description, Eli's son. The Cliff's Notes? The guy is a piece of shit, as evidenced by him showing up hours late to his own father's funeral. \r\n\r\nI don't want trouble, I stand, the little prick can't be more than 5'7, a full head shorter than myself, with faded meth scars and not so faded gin blossoms dotting his nose. \r\n\r\nNot that i have any right to judge the last part. \r\n\r\n\"I was just leaving Steve, but for the record, you are extremely wrong about me and your dad.\" I say, trying to get past the scrawny addict.\r\n\r\nOf course he isn't smart enough to just let me. \r\n\r\n\" I don't think I am actually, what other reason would a 30 something year old be spending all his time around some old guy? Always thought the old man was bent, so no surprise. \r\n\r\nBut the way I see things, is you got a lot of shit coming to you that is mine by right. I'm his son, not you, you Marlyn Manson looking, lurch shaped piece of shit. \" Steve smiles up at me, and i think of how easy it would be to snap his spine over the back of one of these chairs. \r\n\r\nI keep my voice low, and calm,\" Steve, what I 'get' is to clean out my dead best friends apartment, because you are his only family, and clearly are incapable of putting down the syringe long enough to move a box or pick up a broom. \r\n\r\nI don't care if this is guilt at being a hemmerhoid on society for your entire life, or just a cash grab, but I'm not playing. \" \r\n\r\nI try to walk forward, push by the scum bag, but i feel a small prick in my stomach. He's  holding an oversized folding knife, low and discreet, his black toothed smile spreading. \r\n\r\nQuicker than he can react I grab his right hand in my left, releasing the lock on the cheap gas station knife, my right clamps down on the blade, catching his fingers between it and the handle. \r\n\r\n\"Shhhh\" I whisper\" if you make a sound you lose the fingers\", i squeeze the blade until I feel bone, to underline my point. \r\n\r\nBlood pours down his hand all but invisible in our corner of the dimly lit room. \r\n\r\n\"I'm going to let go in a couple of seconds. Then, you're going to stick your had in your pocket, walk outside and take a cab to the hospital. \r\n\r\nIf you do anything else, if you so much as stop to sneeze, i'will have you out of this building before anyone notices, and I'll leave you bleeding to death in an alley. \" i keep my eye's locked to the bloodshot orbs of the addict, i take the knife, and for the briefest of seconds I see a flicker of defiance run through the man's eyes. \r\n\r\nBut he's smarter than he looks, and  follows my request to the letter. \r\n\r\nI left the wake a few minutes later, and find myself standing in Eli's apartment, half a buzz on, and the other half sitting on his tattered couch in the form of 6 40 oz bottles of Grey Snow malt liquor. \r\n\r\nAt first glance the place is a nightmarish horder's den. Boxes of erata stacked to the ceiling, every available surface holding some cup, knick knack or half repaired electronic, but all of this is just a facade, just something to throw off anyone that might want to start sniffing around, police, or otherwise. \r\n\r\nBut the place, really, is half armory half evidence locker. Organized via cypher, anything we felt we could use that we came across was here somewhere hidden among hundreds of warped records and fake dead cats.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, you've probably asked yourself what the hell is it that I actually do. Let me clear that up as best I can. \r\n\r\nIf I'm being unbiased, there are 2 answers to this question. \r\n\r\nThe first, is that I'm a lunatic who slapped together an absurd moral arguement to take out his worst desires on other people. Then weaved a web of delusion around himself involving secret government agencies, serial killers, and a war vet.  \r\n\r\nNow, the second answer, is the one I'd prefer you to believe. And the one I tell myself every day is the truth. \r\n\r\nI'm a guy who broke one day after seeing evidence of the worst type of crime. Who went to go out in a blaze of glory, ridding the world of one vile man, and ended up failing upwards, turning a handful of brutal, if deserved acts, into an urban legend who sits in the back of the minds of the worst people out there, making them question just how much of a reputation they can amass before coming face to face with me. \r\n\r\nThere's more to it than that, of course, but that's a whole other story. \r\n\r\nThe first part of the night goes quickly, getting rid of all the general crap Eli had amassed over the years. Just general old man junk, magazines from the 80's, expired canned food, medications he really should have been taking, nothing that required any thought to sort through. \r\n\r\nSo I drank, my mind wandering, my legs stumbling and my eyes crying as I dropped boxes of useless crap down the rusted garbage chute in the hallway. \r\n\r\nWhen the last faded playboy and ball of rubber bands had been thrown away I was left with the real task ahead of me. The decade worth of what police would likely call \"Evidence of serial murder.\". \r\n\r\nI'm dismantling a massive custom handgun using a cold welder and a hacksaw, when I'm hit with everything all at once. \r\n\r\nI remember us laughing at how useless the thing was, the man wielding it was a bloodthirsty leader of a half gang half cult, but this tacticool nightmare was so impractical he didn't land a shot within 5 feet of me as I calmly sauntered up to him, and and stove in his skull with a lead cored lucite walking stick. \r\n\r\nAnd that one brutal, stupid memory starts a flood of every negative emotion that has been brewing inside of me since I found his body, still in an armchair, taped re run of All in the Family still playing on the television. \r\n\r\nI feel disconnected, surreal, i rock and shake, swearing, crying and raging at nothing in particular besides the series of bad luck and decisions that lead to this point. \r\n\r\nWay in the back of my mind, I hear it, the voice, one of 2 actually. Whispering to me. \r\n\r\nMental health is at least as important as physical health when you spend your life doing shit that no decent person wants to do. That's why a handful of psych meds are as much a part of my equipment as any gun, knife, disguise or first aid item. \r\n\r\nBut ever since I gave up making people laugh and devoted my life to trying to make people safe there have been  2 little voices that no amount of abilify or Seroquel can touch. I call them Norman and the Boyscout. They don't talk to me, so much as I find my brain tuning into them from time to time. Personally, I think they are real people, out there somewhere, but I'm well aware that most scitzophrenics would say the same. \r\n\r\nNorman, he's a dark scary  piece of work. He knows how to stalk, lie, and feel like a million bucks while doing it. \r\n\r\nThe Boyscout, he might be crazier than I am. He talks like a golden age comics character meets a brain injury victim. But everything about combat i didn't learn from Eli, i learned from him. \r\n\r\nI drown out Norman with more of the vaguely skunky tasting beer, and force myself to keep plugging away at the apartment. \r\n\r\nEvery item brings up a new memory, but one stands out among the rest. It's simple, an old cracked blackberry phone. It belonged to Doctor Alfred Grochowski, a man who I made sure never made it into any top ten serial killer lists. The bastard had a body count more like a disease than a man. \r\n\r\nBut originally, it wasn't him I was after. \r\n\r\nThe media called him the \"Eighth Street Ogre.\", stupid name for an average sized guy with almost no discernable features. His M. O was to find an isolated 24/7 party store, kill the clerk, steal the person's uniform, then proceede to brutalize a handful of customers through the course of the night before disappearing. \r\n\r\nNo video, only the odd witness from across a street, or deep in an alley. The exact type of scenario Eli and I loved to get involved in. \r\n\r\nAfter weeks of dead ends and bad leads, either luck or skill lead to us finding the ogre, though not before he had decapitated the lone clerk in the comcally small bodega.And true to reports, he wasn't anyone obviously dangerous. \r\n\r\nShort, with a wavy mop of dark hair obscuring his eyes, the only feature that stood out was his waxy almost feverish skin. \r\n\r\nthe store had 3 customer's jammed into it, likely violating a handful of fire codes. The rusted bell rings as i bring that number to four. \r\n\r\nThe orgre notices me, I notice the mangled body behind the counter. \r\n\r\nRemember Sam talking about me being a birthday clown before? Well, she was being an asshole, but not totally off. Before all of this, I was a professional, registered, facepaint on an egg in Paris, clown. And to answer your question, yes the job prospects for that are exactly what you would assume, but it did leave me with a few skills. \r\n\r\nOne of which was the uniform I was wearing. A black and red tramps outfit, hanging off of my lanky form. It breaks every rule of the art of clowning, and is an eye straining disaster, just subtle enough to walk the streets in, just distracting enough to make someone wonder how much of a threat I could really be? \r\n\r\nI hold the walking stick, 5 pounds of giveless lucite, and point it at the dead eyed man. \r\n\r\n\" We need to go outside and have a little...\" i stop mid sentence, jaw just about hanging, the guy is half way across the tiny store before I register he moved. \r\n\r\nI havn't even taken a step before he tackles a 50 year old man into a glass fronteted beer fridge. In an instant the floor is flooded with razor sharp shards and foaming liquid. \r\n\r\nThe other two patrons, a tall rough looking guy who I would have assumed was the scary one in the store and a young, drunk looking woman stare at the scene, immobile. \r\n\r\nThe ogre bludgeons, tears and slams his victim, never once pausing to pick up a weapon, or Adress any of the massive, yet barely bleeding cuts on his own body. I've seen every kind of killer, professional, talented amateur, rage, and every other color of the worthless psycho rainbow. But never someone who can turn a person into a mangled lump of flesh In a matter of minutes, using nothing but his bare hands. \r\n\r\nThe killer is silent, turning on me, and i wish i had came in with more than a stick and a knife. Walking around armed is risky, and i thought i was going to be dealing with some guy with sedatives and a lead pipe not... Whatever the hell the demon in front of me is. \r\n\r\nThe ogre lunges, i swing with the cane, demolishing his jaw, splitting it into a flapping, almost insect like looking mandible. \r\n\r\nThis should have killed the man, and if by some miracle that didn't happen, it should have turned his lights out in an instant, Ir left him bleeding to death from his face. \r\n\r\nDrops of thick red blood slowly fall from the wound, but the dead eyed rage of the ogre doesn't skip a beat, he throws aside a cheap stell rack, stomping toward rough looking man. \r\n\r\nFinally the two sheep tune into their situation and start to scramble out of the store, i run at the ogre trying to grab him, take him to the ground, i'm met with the stiffest elbow I've ever experienced directly between my eyes. \r\n\r\nI'm on the ground dazed, and before I can shake the black spots from my vision he's on top of me. \r\n\r\nEvery blow feels like a cinder block, he wrenches my shoulder out of socket, i manage to draw my knife for all of about 2 seconds before he sends it flying across the store. \r\n\r\nSound goes dim, one of my eyes is swollen shut, and it's all I can do to put up one arm and try and gouge, tear and poke my way free of death. \r\n\r\nNone of this makes sense, the human body doesn't work like this, i see no technology, or even clever weapons on the guy. What i do see is no less than three wounds that should have killed him long before he started taking me apart. \r\n\r\nI hear 4 loud pops, and feel blood hot enough to sald splash across my face. The ogre's chest sports 4 ragged, quarter sized wounds. Bad grouping, cheap ammo by the sounds of it, not Eli. \r\n\r\nFinally the invincible bastard seems to notice a wound, getting to his feet, and stumbling almost drunkenly out of the store. The girl is gone, but i see the pig eyed, man standing, shaking, holding a pawn shop pistol and likely on the verge of a heart attack. \r\n\r\nEli copies and erases the security footage, the man wanted nothing to do with the cops, and i spend my time recuperating assuming that whoever the ogre was, he died a slow death after whatever the hell was on wore off. Bad grouping or not, four shots through the chest after everything else is three stooges leaves of body trauma. \r\n\r\nMy shoulder hadn't even stopped clicking before we began to see similar police reports and news segments. \r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, a few weeks later I found myself staring and the same short, waxen, man, crimson stained hands pretending to sort lottery tickets. \r\n\r\nThis time I was wearing nothing more attention grabbing than a pair of blue jeans and a large hooded parka. The night was clear and I was hidden well, watching this human pipe bomb get ready to do his thing. \r\n\r\nSorry if it seems cold to watch someone murder a handful of people in a knock off 7-11, but in the real world, there are things you can fix and things you leave the hell alone. This situation was rapidly approaching 'leave the hell alone status'. Usually when this kind of thing happens Sam gives us a call, and at least a bit of reasoning, and we leave it alone. But neither her, nor anyone she had favors to call in from knew anything about the ogre. \r\n\r\nWithout the distraction of me trying and  failing to put a stop to his rampage, the hunched, animalistic little man tore his victims apart at his leisure. \r\n\r\nLong after he stalked off into the night, i made my way into the store, the bent steel, shattered wood, limbs torn from bodies, my first thought would be some kind of explosive, but i watched, as this place was nearly leveled, blow by blow, scream by scream. \r\n\r\nSo, that night Eli and I had ' The Talk'. \r\n\r\nEli, at one point was the type of guy who, when something was 'need to know', needed to know. He'd read the X-Files, and kept going to Y and Z, if you get what I'm saying. \r\n\r\nBut this, was the moment we both knew could happen, even if all evidence pointed toward it being bulls hit. The moment we find something actually paranormal. \r\n\r\nSounds stupid, i know, but when the evidence is dripping from the walls, things get a little hard to ignore. \r\n\r\nSo instead of hooking up with some scary guys selling  scary guns, or maybe calling in a few friends in low places to even the odds I spent a month dealing with the most shit stuffed assholes on the face of the earth. \r\n\r\nPsychics, cryptozoologists, ghost hunters, occultists, every word out of their mouths made my brain revolt, and every penny I gave them for their time made my soul cry, I knew even if I found one that got me on the other right track the other hundred were still con artists and horrible human beings. \r\n\r\nI was convinced this had to be a vampire, nothing else really made sense, not that any option in the Woo Woo rainbow did, but this felt like the cleanest end of the turd to grab. \r\n\r\nEli was, ironically more of the mind this was a real urban legend, not some guy like me, using overactive imaginations to create a paper tiger, but some blight on the city, and spent his time trying to sort through creepypasta and psychotic ramblings. \r\n\r\nThe last time i was face to face with the ogre was in a massive, overnight grocery store, victims were plentiful, homeless folks looking for a warm place to be, shift workers getting frozen food, and all the other assorted misfits who frequent vendors in the wee hours of the morning. \r\n\r\nHe was pushing a mop, haphazardly across the canned food isle, but i watched him as he stared at his prey, his body twitching in anticipation of violence and bloodshed. \r\n\r\nI'm wearing a leather jacket thick enough to stop a bullet, and while I could be just another face in the crowd, every stitch of clothing I wear is reenforced, or holding one of the handful of occult 'weapons' I brought with me. \r\n\r\nI'm almost disapointed when he doesn't seem to recognise me, giving me no more of a look than any of the victims milling about the store. \r\n\r\nMy hand untwists the vial of the bottle of holy water, i stopper it with my thumb as I close the distance between us. I'm close enough to smeel an ammonia reek coming off of him, like urine and sweat in competing excess amounts, as I pull the bottle from my pocket, splashing it in the creatures face. \r\n\r\nHe recoils, stumbling backward, and i smile as I realise this fight is going to go a lot different than the first. \r\n\r\nI shouldn't have smiled. \r\n\r\nHe was shocked, and stumbled backward, wiping at his face, because, well, that's what anyone would do when someone splashes an unknown liquid in their eyes. \r\n\r\nNo smoke, no hissing, no half melted walking corpse, just a wet, angry man shaped thing holding a broken mop handle like a dagger. \r\n\r\nCan you guess what effect the silver bullets had? \r\n\r\nAnyone think garlic worked? \r\n\r\nAnd for extra credit, who can answer if a cross did anything to even slow the ogre? \r\n\r\nAnyone who the questions positively has not been paying attention. \r\n\r\nIt was the worst beating I had taken, and handed to me by a guy using nothing more dangerous than his own flesh bare hands. To add insult to injury, he casually extinguished life after life as he did it. \r\n\r\nThrown ten feet through a  plate glass window, saved only by the tattered remains of leather and steel from my outfit, i crawl through the parking lot. I roll onto my back, watching the oger walk through the window, heedless of the shards of glass tearing strip from his legs. \r\n\r\nI can't do anything but try and breathe as the creature walks over to me, pausing a moment to take in the broken man below him. \r\n\r\nI don't close my eyes, i want to see what fate this thing has in store for me. Eli has to be watching, maybe whatever it does  will give him some kind of clue as to how to take it out. \r\n\r\nI take what I assume is going to be my last breath as the Ogre falls upon me, but before I feel those steel fingers tearing into me half of the things head evaporates, I honestly expect the wound to repair itself, of the Ogre to keep going, heedless of the wound, but he drops, lifelessly as I'm sprayed with what used to be his grey matter. \r\n\r\nI look in the direction of the gunshot, and there stands Eli, holding the largest handgun I've seen to date. On the ground below him, is a tall man in his mid 50's who would be photogenic if not for the severe facial bruising somehow caused by my octogenarian partner. \r\n\r\nDr. Grochowski, not that I knew that at the time. \r\n\r\nHe fixes me with a cold stare that tells me that if there wasn't the barrel of an elephant pistol aimed at his head, he wouldn't be going quietly. \r\n\r\nHe should have taken the chance Eli was as blind as he looks. \r\n\r\nWe took him to a warehouse Eli rents, worst lot in the worst block in the city. But the soundproof room worked for times when we needed to ask questions people didn't want to answer. \r\n\r\nThe good doctor didn't start talking until a week in, long past the point of pulling fingernails and keeping him up for days. It wasn't until I started in on his hands that he finally opened his corpse like lips. \r\n\r\nIn a world that wasn't hell bent on being a tragic joke, Dr. G would have been the kind of guy to cure cancer, or invent an artificial heart. But instead this once in a century genius saw that as below him. \r\n\r\nThe good Doctor wanted to make monsters. \r\n\r\nBut after decades of trial and error, he found something medical science won't fully understand fot another 50 years or so. \r\n\r\nThe exact limits of the human body. \r\n\r\nThis depressed the lovecraft hero wannabe as he realised his dreams of an army of uber mensch were not, nor ever could be attained. Monsters don't exist and they certainly can't be made. \r\n\r\nSo he set his sites lower, if he couldn't create monsters, he wanted to create a legend. \r\n\r\nWhen we found the old farmhouse he had been using to store and mutilate his victims, that's when i stopped feeling bad for taking pieces of the man. Human beings, packed together, dead from starvation and exposure, treated with no more concern than a forgotten jar of tadpoles. \r\n\r\nI wasn't fighting a single bullet proof, steel muscled monster. \r\n\r\nEach ogre was a victim, made identical to the last by what may be the most skilled surgeon on earth, and pumped full of a cocktail of drugs that are a guarented death spent in a lobotomised haze, \r\n\r\nHe promised them freedom for a set amount of kills in the store, giving their slowly shutting down brain one goal to focus on till strokes, broken bones and incidental trauma left them as much a mangled corpse as their victims. \r\n\r\nHe seemed so proud to say he \"cracked the twenty minute mark\", in regards to survival time. I don't like to think of myself as someone who likes the violence I have to commit, but I took the man's eye for that remark. \r\n\r\nWe whittled that man down to a sightless torso to gain every bit of medical knowledge inside that twisted mind of his. I lost a bit of my soul doing what I did to him, but what we learned was a true torch in the darkness, showed us we didn't live in a world of monsters, the universe is ran by logic and reason, easy to understand once you know the rules. \r\n\r\nI box the last of the useful items, and turn the last grenade into unidentifiable scrap. I grab a box to go back to my apartment, files, and a few dubiously useful firearms and explosives. And think of how two grown men, well versed in just how surreal the world can be still went full medieval peasent the second their worldview was questioned. \r\n\r\nAnd questioning your worldview is where this story truly starts kids. \r\n\r\nWhat, you thought this was going to be a story about a group of cut rate superheroes bonding over tragedy and saving the world one last time? \r\n\r\nFuck no. \r\n\r\nFirst, as a story, that one has been told to death. \r\n\r\nSecond, as an event, it doesn't usually go that way. Tragedy, more often than not, is a wedge that gives people the excuse to part, versus the kind of relationship superglue media would have you believe. \r\n\r\nNo, I'm no hero, and I sure as hell am in no way super. \r\n\r\nThis story starts as that door closes behind me, and I notice I'm standing in a building that I've never seen, wearing clothes I've never owned, and holding not a box of of disturbing facts and violence, but a bag of groceries, and a set of keys. \r\n\r\nMy story starts in a city that calls itself New York, but bears little resemblance to the metropolis I've spent my life in. In a place that's two steps off of normal, streets with different names, landmarks with different histories, a place with plenty of dark corners containing things i couldn't dream of, a place of dangerous whispers and, Hollow Promises.",

        "text": "I recently bought a house in Florida I won't say the exact place to stay anonymous\nFor information I live alone and far from any friends or family.\nIt was my first night there it was about 11 pm I was getting ready to sleep while I suddenly heard banging noises coming from downstairs I jumped out of bed to check what it was but the moment I stood up the noises stopped I tried looking all over the house to see where it could've came from but I couldn't find anything about after 10 minutes of searching I gave up and assumed it was just from the neighbor next door I woke up again that night at about 4 am I started to hear the banging noises again I assumed it was just the neighbor again and I told my self I would call the previous owner of the house(Jim)tommorow and ask if it was common to hear these noises.\n\n\n\n\nI woke up the next day and called the previous owner we started talking a bit about how I liked the house etc...\nThe moment I started talking about the strange noises coming from downstairs the owner stopped talking he started mumbling and he sounded nervous I tried talking to him but he just stayed silent after a few seconds he hung up I tried to call him back afterwards but he didn't answer I was very confused but still didn't think much of it .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater that day I went to talk with the neighbor(Mike)next door to check if the noise could've came from him.\nI knocked on his door and he opened up with a smile and said \"you're the new guy who just moved here right?\" I answered yeah it's me he asked \"so do you like the area so far?\" I replied yes it's great here but I have a question to ask you he said \"what is it?\" It's about some noises I keep hearing, banging noises Mike's smile faded away instantly I knew something was wrong but didn't say anything ro not be rude, I asked is there a chance they're coming from your house Mike said \"no but I used to hear them too, when Jim moved to your house a couple years ago every night I would hear those noises at some point I confronted him about it but he acted like he didn't know anything I tried calling the police once but the they didn't do much just gave him a warning. sometimes these banging sounds would turn into screaming but it was only on rare occasions\" I was surprised to hear all of this I was even more scared than before I thanked Mike for telling Me this and I wished him Goodluck Mike said \"look before you leave I gotta tell you i don't know what Jim did there at night but I can tell you that whatever caused those noises is still there and Jim moved away because it started to be a too big of a problem for him to handle\"\nMike closed the door.\nI walked back home feeling scared for my life every thought about this house made me nervous it was already 8 pm and I knew these noises would come back soon I sat on the couch on my living room thinking what could I do to solve this after an hour of thinking I decided to follow the sound and check where it comes from.\n\n\nI was sitting in my bed when the time turned to 11 pm I was ready for the noises but nothing happened, I was laying confused on my bed, asking myself why didn't it start I told myself maybe it wouldn't happen today and I got to sleep,\nI was about to fall asleep when I suddenly heard screaming coming from downstairs it wasn't like any screaming I heard In my life it was too loud for a human to even make this noise I followed the sound downstairs into the basement door, the basement door was 2.5 meters in height and 2 meters in length the thickness was 6 inches it was made out of steel I never understood why would anyone need such a big door but the inhumane screaming made me think it should be like that I got close to the door the loudness was getting unbearable the moment I touched the door handle it stopped I tried opening the door but it was locked and there's no way I could open this thing by myself without the key, I just stood there feeling defeated when I started hearing laughter from the basement I couldn't handle it anymore I went outside the house and slept the night in my car.\n\n\n\nI woke up at 12 pm way more late from the times I usually wake up at, I was tired I guess I got out of the car to see the newspaper waiting outside my door I told myself I'll get my mind of this house by reading a bit I opened the newspaper to see a picture of Jim on the front, below it said \"local man killed himself for unknown reasons by shooting himself with a shotgun\" I was shocked but before I could react a police car parked outside my house a cop came out of the car and approached me he said \"did you here about what happent to Jim?\"\nYes I told him he said \"Jim left a note for you, he wrote to give it to you when they found him\"\nHe handed me the note and left.  I got into my house sat down and read the note what was written in there was probably the most disturbing thing I ever read in my entire life it said\n\"I'm sorry I left you with that thing\"\nIn the note was a key to the basement \nI was shaking out of fear I didn't know what to say I just wanted to dissappear from the world and forget about it but I knew I couldn't run away, curiosity got me I needed to know what was in there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI told myself tonight I will open the basement door and find out what's in there all day I was getting ready to do it and there it was the time hit 11 pm the screaming started I was scared but I knew I had to do it, I'm going downstairs to the basement as I'm writing this wish me luck I inserted the key and I opened the door there it was it's looking at me,waiting \nI will end the story here I won't describe it to not traumatize any of the readers I will say that I understand why Jim took his own life.",

        "text": " A daughter and her father were driving through a desolate wasteland. They were returning home after visiting the little girl's mother in the hospital. The girl was about to fall asleep slowly, listening to the sound of the pouring rain falling on the top of the car. \n\nSuddenly a loud noise was heard. The man couldn't control the steering wheel and the car skidded into a stone wall. Her father, who saw that his daughter was not injured, got out of the car to determine the damage. \n\nThere were large holes in both front wheels and the right bumper was warped by the impact of the wall. \"We must have run over something on the way. Whatever it was, it blew both of our tires off,\" the man told his daughter. “But you can fix it, right?” the girl asked. \n\n“No,” the father replied. \"There's only one spare in the trunk. I have to go back - back to town to find someone to tow the car. It's not far. Wait for me in the car until I get back.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" the girl said reluctantly. \"But come soon, okay?\n\nThe man could see that he was afraid of his daughter's eyes. \"Sit still. I'll be right back.\"\n\nIn the rearview mirror, her daughter watched her father drive away tiredly in the pouring rain.\n\nMore than an hour passed, but his father did not return. The girl was starting to get scared. His father should have been back by now.\n\nShe saw someone walking towards the car through the side mirror at that moment. At first she thought it was her father, but when she looked carefully, she saw that he was a strange man. He was wearing overalls, and his beard was quite thick. \n\nHe was carrying something large in his left hand, and it swung back and forth as he stepped forward. Something about him had bothered her. The girl was watching him through the back window of the car as the man got closer and closer. In the dim light she saw what the man was holding. \n\nThe man was holding a large and sharp butcher knife. Thinking quickly, the frightened girl locked the front doors of the car. Then she immediately locked the back doors as well. Looking back at the man, she realized that the man had stopped and was staring directly at him. \n\nSuddenly the man raised his arm and the girl began to scream. In his right hand the man held the head of the girl's father, which had been severed from his body. The girl was screaming nonstop. \n\nHis heart was beating so fast that he was having trouble breathing. The expression in his father's severed head was noticeably meaningless and terrifying. His mouth was open and his eyes were rolled back. \n\nWhen the man got to the car, he leaned his head against the window. He looked at her with angry, bloodshot eyes. His hair was messy. His face was covered with deep wounds. For a moment the man stood in the rain, grinning madly. \n\nThen he reached into his pocket and took out something. He slowly took out what he had taken out. What he pulled out were the girl's father's car keys.",

        "text": "I feel really weird writing this, but I have to talk about this so you know what is going on too. 25 years ago when I was 5 there was this thing called the ”boogeyman”. When I first heard about It I would not sleep until my Dad would check everywhere. Under the bed,The closet, Everywhere. When he checked everywhere I would feel safe and go to sleep, After 2 months it finally happened He showed up, The Boogeyman.\n\nOn the night he showed up I went to my room and played for a few minutes and went to sleep at 9:00. It was 10:00 when he showed up, I forgot to ask my dad to check everywhere. I heard the closet creak open, I shot up and looked around not taking a second to blink. When I looked into the dark and creepy closet it was nothing. I think I’m hallucinating i said in my head. As soon as I said that the door to my room flung open, and a big black flash flew across the doorway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT THE F\\*\\*\\* I said aloud. I quickly rushed through the door and  through the hallway and went in the my parents room. I flung the door open and quickly rushed to the bed. “Why are they under the covers?” I said. I pulled the sheets off and it was pillows underneath. I got scared, I kept thinking to myself where are they, did they get caught by him? As soon as I processed it I knew what that black flash and where my parents would be. I ran to the living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got to the living room I looked around twice.I looked at the couch and saw my dad watching tv.\n\nI said hey to him but he didn’t respond, so I walked around the couch and looked at his face. My mouth dropped when I saw it. His eyes were hollow his mouth was open and drooling, his neck was twisted and his fingers were broken like a hydralic press crushed them. I was horrified when I saw it. I broke down in tears and remembered where’s mom? I stopped crying and tried to find my mom, but no luck. I looked all over the house and still could not find her. I looked outside the car was gone. Did mom leave the house when she saw him? I saw lights flashing outside, they were blue and red. They looked cool and I went outside to see what was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw police cars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I saw our car and it crashed and went into a ditch. I went up there and saw mom her neck was broken. before I could see anymore the police men backed me away from the crash when I turned around I saw the boogeyman.\n\nhe was dark, very dark. He had a wide grin and was at least 6,8 and he pointed at me, and it sounded like he was right in my ear. He said “I’ll see you later“ I gulped when I heard that. And he walked away in the forest and faded away. I lived with foster parents until I was 18 and I got a job and a house. I got a kid named jacob who is now 8 and a wife named Samantha I’m living a good life right now.\n\nI still remember the exact words he said till this day.",

        "text": "Since a few years back I’ve been at random times forced into suffocating silence, but just because I can’t hear anything doesn’t mean it can’t hear me.\n\nDue to recent advents I now know other people are experiencing this strange world I call the further, named after that alternate universe in insidious.\n\nAt first I believed I was the only one who was able to enter the further but now I know that just most the people who can didn’t make it past their first visit,\n\nSo lucky for you guys you get to get a guide from me a 18 year old comic book guy, honestly if you have anyone to thank for this information it would be my brother his collection of fancy knives, they saved my butt on 3 seperate occasions.\n\nRule 1 never make a sound during one of these visits except to confirm you’re in the further, most people will try to get their families or friends attention eventually resorting to yelling.\n\nThis is suicide and also what I did the first time it happened, I was 16 at the time my brother and I where sitting on are phones ignoring each other until I suddenly couldn’t hear the sound from my phone.\n\nI first thought it was the bluetooth but when I realised it was connected and nothing else was making a noise I tapped my headphone which was still in my ear but to my surprise their wasn’t the familiar thud of the headphone going deeper into my ear.\n\nAt thirst I thought I was deaf but them I started talking and realised I could hear myself but nothing else, after some experimentation I learned I could only hear the noises I made and other people trapped in this world.\n\nAt the time I was confused and tried to get my brothers attention leading to one of grabbers as I call them to well grab me, these things are like skeleton arms with ears on their palm of their hands, these creatures can appear anywhere dark but are extremely sensitive to light.\n\nThat and their ears being damaged by ether a weapon in this case my brothers replica of the knife used in Rambo or a extremely loud sound, this is last resort thanks to rule 2.\n\n Rule 2 unless you want to be thrown out a window at luckiest or slowly have your vocal cords removed at worst then find somewhere to hide asap.\n\nDon’t worry if grabbers where in the hiding spot before once you hurt their ears with the noise they will go back to whatever hell they came from, my best places to hide from these things is under a bed or table, these things can’t bend down which is why it flipped me out the window because my throat was out of reach.\n\nI call these monsters Larrys because of their resemblance to the monster named Larry from a cheesy horror movie me and my friends watched.\n\nAfter the first incident happened a started keeping notes on things to test out if I end up there again and how to avoid any creatures that I encountered which eventually became this list.\n\nAfter a few weeks I thought my first one of these events was just a one time cosmic glitch in the matrix which it would’ve been if it hadn’t spotted me which bring us to rule 3 don’t piss off the mime.\n\nThis thing scares the ever loving shit out of me but seems to have no ill intent towards me and no way to get rid of it and it is the thing that keeps bringing me back here.\n\nIt seems to latch onto a person and bring them back again and again just to be around them, but creating these rips in the universe also has the side effect of bringing other people in which is what happened a few months ago.\n\nThe usual weird stuff happens when one of the events happen where everything went silent and the mine showed up and began sitting with me, by this point I had decided to use the further as way to get in some exercise because of the funny thing it does to time.\n\nSo while I was out jogging making sure to be quite with the mine walking along with me, when I heard something, it was a gasp. I darted around to see someone else who was somehow in the further, I turned around to see a girl a few years older then me a school teacher I recognised who had seen me first and came up when she saw me look at the mine.\n\nShe had intended to get me a way from the mine not knowing it wasn’t hostile, at least it wasn’t to me as soon as she grabbed me and started to run the mime completely changed his attitude the joyous grin replaced with anger.\n\nI hadn’t been this scared of the mime since I had first discovered it on my second trip, as I was being lead away by the teachers arm she screamed and her hand loosed it’s grip falling from my arm.\n\nHer severed hand hitting the floor with a wet thud I turned to the mime who was miming having a chainsaw, she then fell to the floor sobbing and whaling uncontrollably as a stood there like an idiot as the mime approach the woman who had risked her life to save me.\n\nThen the mime walked towards me and mimed their being a box around me which when I tried to run was their I was trapped forced to watch the woman’s vocal cords be ripped out by Larry before she bled out of the street.\n\nRule 4 don’t go into malls or clothes shops, this is a pretty simple one and requires little explanation of why it exist, as the clothes dummies are alive and will try to make you scream to get Larry to come and rip out your vocal cords so they can easily take out your inside parts and make them your outside parts while using your lifeless husk as a skin suit.\n\nI could tell you how I now this and it’s because if you go into a mall of clothes store not only will the dummies come to live but so will the shoppers being pulled into the further only to die and have their lives stolen.\n\nIt was a while before I could bring my self to go out again after that, but eventually I did and I learned another a horror that I was completely oblivious to, the dogs who meow.\n\n Rule 5 stay away from them don’t pet them don’t feed them don’t interact with them in anyway, If you do your acknowledge their existence it will be enough to bring them into the normal world, which is not something you want to happen but if it does scream it’ll be quicker that way, I only survived my encounter with them thanks to the mime.\n\nRule 6 don’t trust anyone you meet in the further, most of them aren’t people and only a few of the ones that are aren’t trying to sacrifice you to a god or something or are dumb and don’t know what their doing and unless you both want to be in a earlier grave I recommended you run from anyone you see.\n\nRule 7 if you see a watch or calendar that isn’t the time you entered the further walk back to where you were before it’s too late, for this reason is why I keep a watch on my person that shows both the date and time and check it frequently if anything moves on the watch I’ll usually head home and weight to get back.\n\nRule 8, don’t do any messed up crap like murder or anything like that because the people that die here don’t leave and will be waiting when you come back, and you will be coming back.\n\nFell free to do whatever else while you wait for the universe you know to let you back in, personality my favourite pass time has been trying all the different flavours of ice cream at McDonald’s, yes before you ask the machine works in the further.",

        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nThis isn't a story you have heard before, this one…this one is different. My name is Caroline, but I liked to go by Care.  I grew up in a very small town called Hallow Lane, Ohio. I have two best friends, Ty and Keisha. We have been friends ever since we were kids. I am a Junior in high school, so I have plenty of time, as my mama would say, to party and lollygag. My friend Keisha, who is in a sorority, at Hardaway University loves to try to get me out of my comfort zone and tells me I need to relax and have some fun. This weekend I finally gave in to one of her crazy stunts to get me out the house, which was perfect timing since my parents were out of town, and her sorority was throwing a big Halloween party. She says this is going to be the biggest one yet.\n\nKeshia told me I could bring one friend since they didn't want too many outsiders with me so I invited my best friend Ty. We're not big party people, but let me give you a quick run down about my two best friends. Keisha and I have been best friends since I was born. Her mother Tammy and my mama go way back, so we grew up together and we are practically sisters; she is only two years older than me and she loves to remind me that she is three days, one week, and fifteen seconds older than me, but it makes no difference to me. She aspires to be a lawyer like her mother. I've always admired her because she's so charismatic and outgoing. Now, Ty, I met him in third-grade when he was a transfer student from Alaska and we have always been thick as thieves. His face is like a sword, chiseled and sharp. He smiles so bright it's like looking at a flashlight: delicate but fierce, he sniffs with sharp and private focus through his long, pointed nose and has low curly hair that looks like beach waves. \n\nTy has a very athletic build, but he isn't involved in any school activities. \n\n“It’s for the people who want superficial friends who don't know the real meaning of life”, he says. Keisha came to see us for the first day of school. She's the mom of the group, “Come on you guys squeeze in together, or you're going to be late, get ready to take the picture,” says Keisha.\n\n“I'm nearly 17 and a half and you're still treating me like I'm a child.  I am a man now,” Ty said.  \n\n“Yeah, right you wish to keep dreaming,” Keisha replied jokes\n\nI just laughed.\n\nOur first encounter is something I will never forget. Ty doesn’t like bullies and when booger nose Kenny Osborne took my candy and wouldn’t give it back, Ty came along and chunked a rock right at Kenny’s fathead. Boy did he cry afterwards and since then, Ty and I have been inseparable.\n\nKeisha took our photograph outside, with Ty pretending to have a fake cigarette in his mouth and me self-consciously with my left wrist clasped in my right hand as if I was afraid my wrist was going to get away from me. Keisha used a professional camera, and kept lots of different films. As she chatted and switched cameras, Ty and I were ready to go to class. \n\n“Come on Keish, I didn't go all day. The ladies are calling.” \n\n“Okay, okay, last one, and I’m done,”\n\nKeisha talked about how high school is an experience we need to enjoy and make long-lasting memories and how time flies by and how we should enjoy the moments that we make every day.  \n\n\"You only live once so why not enjoy it while you can before you hit adulthood?”  \n\nAfter her parting words of wisdom, Keisha got in her car and said her goodbyes. While her skin glistened, her jet-black eyebrows arched up the sky, her serious amber eyes seemed more hollow than ever in the fluorescent light streaming through the slits of her bangs. She had wide eyes that were bright and a lot of hair that was not ‘groomed.' I loved her despite all her curly strands of hair that stick out above her head. I felt excited to know that I’m one step close to my milestone — after I graduate Hallow Ln High, I’m finally free. I got it all planned out on going to school in New York to be an artist. I always had a thing for drawing, how it speaks to you and makes you feel emotions all by looking at a picture. Soon, the day was almost over and the first day of school was complete.  \n\n“I made some new friends,” Ty said.  \n\nHe held up his hand to acknowledge Francis and Melissa. They’re twins, two of the most popular people at Barnesville High. Francis took a bottle of soda pop out of his book bag and opened it on the lunch table.  \n\n“Come and sit with us”, Francis said.\n\n“Yeah, I love to, but, I should try and get some of this homework done while the night’s still young.”\n\n“See ya,” Care bear. \n\nTy has never had a problem with making friends but me on the other hand, I'm more of an introvert. I really don't talk much to people. They must talk to me first because I always end up saying the wrong things, which makes the conversation really weird. My mama always tells me to “just breathe and take a breath and say one sentence at a time,” but that never works. I always screw it up.",

        "text": "By everyone, I mean everyone: from the youngest members, toddlers and babies still held by their mothers, to the oldest, those needing walkers and wheelchairs.\n\nThese games have been held for as long as I can remember, and probably have been much, much longer. It’s tradition, so to speak, an old one.\n\nOurs is a remote community. A small village, nestled between various forests and almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world. We rarely get visitors from outside, and whoever does never stays for long.\n\nI guess we’re seen as a peculiar kind of people, one that’s a bit backwards.\n\nWhen I was a child, I loved nothing more than these games of hide-and-seek. I would always look forward to this big event that everyone would play together.\n\nEven as a child, though, I wondered why certain people were there.\n\nMrs. Meier, our first grade teacher, was a ghastly old lady who didn’t seem to know the word ‘play’ existed. Yet there she was.\n\nI even remembered old eighty-seven-year-old Mrs. Ritter joining in on the fun after her accident. How she’d even be able to find a hiding place, wheelchair-bound as she was, was anyone’s guess. And it seemed, a year later, she’d realized she was a tad bit too old for it after all. For I never saw her at our annual game of hide-and-seek ever again.\n\nWhat was fun as a boy, however, grew boring, even annoying the older I got. As a teenager, I’d long since grown tired of it. Traditions be damned, I thought.\n\nYet dad made sure I was always there, even if he had to drag me out of bed. Even worse, he’d always mention mom and how she would’ve wanted nothing more than for me to take part in the annual game of hide-and-seek. I hated it, and I hated him for exploiting her death in this way.\n\nWhenever I complained about it, whenever I asked why we’d all have to do it, the only answer I ever got was that it was tradition. Yeah, a dumb, old, useless tradition. Why couldn’t we just enjoy the fair? Instead, we’d all have to go through this stupid ordeal on the morning of the second day...\n\nWhat made it even worse, the event was always the same.\n\nAt first, the rules of the game were explained. They, too, were the same every year. A seeker would be chosen by drawing lots.\n\nThe seeker was never a child, never a teenager, and never one of the old people. No, it was always an adult. Each year, all the kids would beg to be made the seeker, but of course, they were never allowed.\n\nThis seeker would then count down for one minute, and during that time, everyone would have to find a hiding place on the fairgrounds.\n\nAny place else was off-limits, and should you be caught having snuck off, you’d be in serious trouble. One of my friends once tried, and that alone landed him being grounded for the rest of the year. Why? I guess he went against that stupid tradition everyone was so obsessed with.\n\nThere was one difference compared to traditional games of hide-and-seek. The game always ended when the seeker had found a single person.\n\nToday was another glorious day of hide-and-seek, but today, things were different for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, I was a teenager now, and as a teenager, I learned that a village fair was about more than raffles and games. No, it was about dancing, and most of all, drinking.\n\nBeing the over-enthusiastic type I was, I got drunk, seriously drunk. So drunk, in fact, some of my friends had to escort me home. I knew fairly well what tradition would force me to do came morning, but I couldn’t have cared less. Or maybe I did care after all, and that’s why I got as drunk as I did. I don’t even remember.\n\nWhen dad woke me up at eight in the morning, I was hungover. My entire body felt like shit, and I was suffering from a splitting headache.\n\nLying in bed, I groaned and just stared at him for a few seconds.\n\n“Yeah, dad, sorry, but not this year. I feel like shit. Can’t you guys just do it without me for once?”\n\nOf course, that didn’t work. The moment he’d heard my words, his face grew dark.\n\n“Dammit, Daniel, you knew fair well what day today is, and you still... Just get the hell out of bed and get ready!”\n\nI was about to protest once more, but he cut me off before I could so much as usher a word.\n\n“Now, Daniel!”\n\nWith him still standing in the door, and under his stern eyes, I got dressed before I trudged after him.\n\nAs we made our way to the fair, I heard him mumble and curse to himself behind me. I didn’t understand what he was saying, but I knew it was about me. To be honest, I thought about skipping out more than once, and to just run home and go back to bed. But I knew that wouldn’t fly, not with him watching over me.\n\nAnd so, we finally arrived at the center of the fairgrounds. As every other year before, all the village’s inhabitants were already there.\n\nKids were racing around laughing, excited about the coming game of hide-and-seek. Many of my friends, other teenagers, looked as uninterested as I was. For a moment, I watched some of the older people. Their eyes were tired, their expressions worried. Why’d we all have to go through with this? God, it was so damn stupid.\n\nEven now, I still felt sick to my stomach, and after a while, I wasn’t even able to stand anymore. Instead, I set down on the ground, right there, in the grass. I couldn’t wait for this entire stupid ordeal to be over.\n\nThen I got another idea. Fuck it, I told myself, I’d stay right here. The damned game was always over as soon as a single person was found. So if I’d simply stay here, that was it. Game over. Then I could just go back home and catch some much needed rest.\n\nOnce again, the rules were reiterated before it came to decide who today’s seeker would be.\n\nAs every year before, all the adults stepped forward, and one by one, picked their lot. To my surprise, it was dad who’d be today’s seeker.\n\nWhen I saw his expression, I couldn’t help but laugh. He looked so lost, so confused, even frustrated.\n\nThen he noticed me just sitting there, relaxing on the grass, and hurried over to me.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing, Daniel? Get a freaking move on, for Christ’s sake!”\n\n“Why can’t I just stay here? Then I’ll be the first person you find and the game is-“\n\n“God dammit, Daniel!” he cut me off, snapping at me.\n\nThe moment he’d heard my words, all the color had drained from his face. His eyes were wide and his mouth was quivering. He opened it again as if to explain something to me, but then closed it and pulled me to my feet.\n\n“I dare you son, you find yourself a hiding place right now, or...”\n\nHe was out of it, desperate even. He wasn’t screaming at me. No, he was pleading with me. I’d never seen him like this before, never, not even after mom had died.\n\nI was confused, anxious even, and without knowing why, I nodded and set out.\n\nThen dad returned to his position in the center, closed his eyes and started counting.\n\nI listened to his voice. I watched as everyone, old and young, darted away. For the first time, I realized how surreal this entire situation was.\n\nI’d witnessed it so many times, but only now did I really think about it.\n\nWhy’d dad act like that? Why’d he freak out?\n\nThen, I wondered about something else. What happened when you were found?\n\nI didn’t know. Neither I nor any of my friends had ever been found. No, I couldn’t recall anyone who’d ever been found. Suddenly, a cold shower went down my spine.\n\nI stumbled on, hungover as I was, and realized that the minute was almost up. As the last seconds ticked by, my eyes darted around. On a whim, I rushed to a nearby stall, pushed myself behind a few old planks and tried my best to stay hidden.\n\nFrom where I was, I heard dad announce that time was up, and he was now coming. His voice was shrill, so different from his usual deep one.\n\nI saw him scanning the area nearby. Then he set out. With quick steps, he checked if someone was hiding between a few nearby trees before he swept through a couple of bushes. No one was there. Then he continued on, checking one of the nearby stalls, the one opposite me. I sat there, as quiet as I could, not daring to breathe.\n\nFor an entire minute, I watched as he desperately rummaged through the stall before he moved on to the next one. Why was he in such a hurry? Why was he taking this dumb thing so seriously?\n\nAt that moment, I saw someone else nearby. It was behind the stall dad was now approaching. Someone was hiding, or rather, sat slumped against its wall. It was Terrance Mueller, our very own resident drunk.\n\nUntil a year ago, Terrance had been a proud member of our community, a good worker. When his wife suddenly died, however, he’d taken to the bottle.\n\nAfter he’d lost his job, he’d spent the past months at the village’s small bar, drinking away what little money he’d saved up over the years.\n\nHungover like me, or more accurate, already drunk, he too, hadn’t been able to find a good hiding place. All he’d done was to slump down behind a stall, probably hoping that dad would just walk past him.\n\nI saw how he watched dad from behind the stall’s corner, trying his best to find out where he was going while staying hidden. A moment later, he lost his balance, stumbled from his hiding place, and crashed to the ground.\n\nDad noticed him instantly. A flood of emotions washed over his face. There was anger, frustration, and then nothing but sadness.\n\nTerrance let out a terrified shriek and tried his best to scramble away, and to find himself a new hiding place.\n\n“You know the rules, Terrance,” dad called after him.\n\nThe drunk stumbled on for a few more steps before he came to a halt. A moment later, dad reached him and put his hand on his shoulder.\n\nWhen it happened, Terrance pushed him back, slurring curses at him I didn’t understand.\n\n“God dammit Terrance, I don’t want to do this either, but it’s the only way!”\n\nWhat the hell was dad talking about? The only way for... what?\n\nBy now, tears were streaming down Terrance's cheeks. Once more, he pushed dad away, before all power seemed to leave him and he was about to fall to the ground once more. In a swift motion, dad held him up, steadied him before he whispered something into his ear.\n\nTerrance's eyes grew wide. He opened his mouth, most likely to spew another set of insults at dad, but then a dejected, hopeless look came over his face. Finally, he nodded.\n\nThen the two of them set out together. I watched as dad led him away, away from the fairgrounds.\n\nAfter sitting in my hiding place for a few more seconds, I pushed myself from the stall, and, trying my best to stay hidden, went after them. Eventually, they approached the edge of the nearby forest, and then ventured inside.\n\nI didn’t know what was going on, didn’t know what was about to happen, but all those strange thoughts from before returned to me.\n\nI’d barely made it past the first couple of trees when I saw them again. They were standing there, but I noticed something in Terrance's hand, something he must’ve hidden until now. I watched in stunned horror as he lifted a hammer he must’ve found at the stall he was hiding at.\n\n“Dad, watch out!” I called out.\n\nIn sheer and utter surprise, he jerked around, staring at me with wide, surprised eyes. It was this minute movement that saved his life. Terrance, drunk as he was, barely grazed dad’s head before he crashed to the ground, now cursing again.\n\n“No, not me, not after Sara, not after...” I finally understood him.\n\nDad just stared down at him, holding onto the now bleeding wound on his head. In an instant, he kicked the hammer Terrance had been holding away.\n\nBy now, however, Terrance's resistance was entirely broken. He just lay there on the ground, with tears streaming from his eyes.\n\n“That’s enough Terrance. You lost. What would Sara say if she saw you like that?”\n\nFor a second, the drunk’s eyes focused on dad.\n\n“You know nothing,” he brought out under tears. “That damned lot, when I found her, I...”\n\nAt that moment, I saw something.\n\nRight in front of dad and Terrance, something moved between the trees. At first, I thought it was nothing but shadows.\n\nThe longer I looked, however, the more I focused on it, the more I knew that wasn’t right. It was a strange, slithering thing, one that was way too big to be any sort of forest animal.\n\nI could do nothing but stare at whatever was out there in a mixture of stunned horror and overwhelming wonder. Branches broke, trunks were pushed aside before a multitude of bony arms pushed themselves from between the trees.\n\nIn an instant, dad was by my side. I was still staring at the mad spectacle in front of me, still couldn’t take my eyes from whatever it was I saw. Then dad slapped me across the face.\n\n“Get back! We have to hide! And don’t you dare look at it, don’t you dare!”\n\nWith that, he dragged me back, back to the fairgrounds, and pushed me behind the nearest stall. Hidden, and sitting next to dad, I opened my mouth.\n\n“What the-?” I started, but dad covered my mouth, shaking his head vehemently.\n\nFrom where we were, we could hear the sounds. Something crashing through the forest. Distant, otherworldly sounds that might have been laughter reached our ears. In between, I could’ve sworn I heard Terrance's voice.\n\nFor long minutes, dad and I just sat there. Finally, silence returned.\n\nWhen it was over, I felt dad squeezing my shoulder. He gave me a well-meaning nod before he got up and motioned for me to come along.\n\nIn a loud, booming voice, he announced that this year’s game of hide-and-seek had ended.\n\nFor a moment, I scanned the forest ahead, almost waiting for Terrance to return, but he didn’t. No, he was gone.\n\nSlowly, ever so slowly, everyone returned from their hiding places and gathered in the center of the fairgrounds. I heard the whispered conversations between the adults, between the older people, and a few times, I heard the name Terrance.\n\nEventually, everyone dispersed, and everyone returned to the fair’s merriment as if nothing had happened.\n\nChildren were laughing and complaining the game was already over, teenagers were joking about how dumb it all was, but here and there, I saw other expressions. Adults who couldn’t hide their emotions, their frustration at what had just happened.\n\nLike me now, they all knew this was not just a dumb old tradition.\n\nMy eyes darted around, searching for dad. When I saw him, he was alone, already waiting for me, for the outburst he knew to come.\n\n“What the hell was that... that thing? What’s going on? Why’s everyone just... Fuck!”\n\n“Let’s go for a walk, son. We shouldn’t talk here, not with everyone around.”\n\nI cursed once more, was about to lay into him, but the sad look on his face was enough to make me comply.\n\nFor a few minutes, we walked in silence as he led me to a bench far away from the bustle of the fair. Then, he started to explain.\n\nNo one knew what those things out there in the forest were. They arrived a long time ago, or they’d always been there, but one day, they came for the villagers.\n\nEventually, someone had made an arrangement with them. Once a year, they’d get what they wanted, if the rest of the village could live in peace.\n\n“Then Terrance, no, this entire game, it-“\n\n“It’s a selection, son. Whoever’s found first, is to become...”\n\nHis voice trailed off. He shook his head, and I saw tears coming to his eyes.\n\nSuddenly, things fell into place. Certain little details I’d never wondered about before. Old Mrs. Ritter, who’d never joined into the game again after appearing in her wheelchair one year. My friend’s uncle, who’d used the game to sneak away from his wife and leave the village behind. And mom, mom who’d died on...\n\n“Mom... that trip, that accident you told me about! It’s... no, don’t tell me...”\n\nDad, however, said nothing. He just sat there, his head in his hands, weeping. When he spoke again, his voice was as quiet as a whisper.\n\n“No one wants to go through with it, son, but there’s no other choice. People tried to hide, to stay home, but, whenever they do, they are just… gone. Others tried to run, but whoever enters the forests, whoever tries to get away, is never heard from again.”\n\nAnd so, I finally knew the truth. I knew what this stupid old tradition was about:\n\nIt was nothing but a selection, a selection to decide [this year’s sacrifice](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter).\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "I’m posting this because I can’t stop thinking about this woman and I feel like sharing this might help me get some closure.\n\nBack when I was about 24 in 2007, I was arrested after I was caught with weed while it was illegal in my state. \n\nI was sent to a women's prison somewhere in New York. You'd think the scariest thing I would have experienced was being around violent criminals of all walks of life or some crooked officers.\n\nNo. The scariest thing I ever had to deal with in that prison was who I swear was probably not human.\n\nIt all started one day when I was chatting with my cellmate named Roxanne. Roxanne was arrested for involuntary manslaughter after her ex-boyfriend broke into her house.\n\nA new prisoner was brought into the cell across from ours.\n\nThe woman didn't look like she belonged here. She was a petite, adorable looking woman with short, fluffy strawberry blonde hair and green eyes. She had a happy looking smile on her face, like she was happy to be arrested.\n\nMe and Roxanne looked at each other in confusion. \n\n\"I wonder what she got in here for?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know. She doesn't look like a criminal. Looks like a kindergarten teacher.\" \n\nRoxanne looked at the lady. \"Yo! Whatcha in for!\"\n\nThe woman tilted her head, still smiling. \"I'd rather not say.\"\n\nThe way the woman talked matched her expression. Excited but soft and airy.\n\nRoxanne looked a bit confused. She turned to me.\n\n\"Damn, I wonder what she did that she wants to keep secret.\" Roxanne said, scratching the back of her head.\n\nRoxanne faced the woman again. \"You got a name?\"\n\n\"Judith.\" Replied the woman, still smiling.\n\nI could see Roxanne become mildly unsettled by Judith's unusually chipper attitude.\n\n\"Uh, cool!\" Roxanne had an uncomfortable smile on her face.\n\nRoxanne started whispering to me. \"Not gonna lie Carrie, this bitch creeps me out.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I whispered back. \"No one should be this happy to be arrested.\"\n\nThe next morning, Roxanne and I woke up to hear a fellow inmate whimpering to the guard.\n\nIt was Judith's cellmate, she looked scared out of her mind like she had been tortured.\n\n\"Please get me out of here! Put me in solitary confinement! I don't care! Anywhere but with her!\" The inmate groveled.\n\nThe guard gave her a sympathetic shoulder rub and let her out.\n\nThe guard walked into the cell to talk to Judith.\n\nMe and Roxanne watched in anticipation to see what would happen.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the guard began screaming in pain. She ran out, holding her hand up to her eye. It was bleeding like crazy.\n\nJudith peeked out and showed up the eyeball of the guard like she was proud of what she did. Once again, she still had that happy go lucky smile on her grin.\n\nMe and Roxanne almost couldn't believe what we were seeing. We weren't even sure if Judith was capable of doing something like that. The guard was a 6 foot tall woman bulging with muscle and Judith looked like you could snap her over your knee.\n\nMe and Roxanne turned away to talk.\n\n\"Holy shit! D-did she do that!?\" I exclaim in shock.\n\n\"Yeah! How can a ten pound little lady like her do that?\" Roxanne added.\n\nAll the while, we would occasionally see Judith peeking at us with that same smile that now took on a more sinister undertone.\n\nShe was put in the hole for a week and charged with assault. But, we all now now that wouldn't work.\n\nOne day at lunch, me and Roxanne ate and chatted.\n\nI felt a sense of dread when I saw Judith walk to our table with a tray of food, still smiling that damn smile.\n\nAs she walked, she accidentally bumped into a taller inmate, knocking her food away.\n\n\"Watch it, bitch!\" The inmate snarled.\n\nJudith was barely fazed. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThis made her mad. The inmate grabbed Judith by her collar. \n\n\"You think you're better than me, smiley! How about I wipe that shit off your face-\"\n\nJudith grabbed a fork off of a nearby table. Without hesitation, she stabbed the inmate in her jugular. The inmate grabbed the area as it spurted blood like a fountain.\n\nA few guards came to take the inmate to the infirmary.\n\nJudith looked towards us, her smile appearing wider.\n\nMe and Roxanne took our trays and moved to a different table.\n\nIt only took a month for the entire prison to fear Judith. She went through every cellmate like toilet paper and no one dared cross her.\n\n Even the guards were petrified of her and would approach her cell like she was a dangerous animal. \n\nThey would wear protective gear when they needed to go in her cell to do routine checks to make sure she wasn’t sneaking in contraband. \n\nAt some point, they stopped punishing her because she would hurt people again no matter how long she was in the hole or how much they charge her.\n\nJudith always looked at me and Roxanne like she was a grizzly bear and we were two vulnerable rabbits. Strangely enough, we were always spared from her wrath. We weren’t sure if she liked us or she was waiting for any reason to horribly maim us.\n\nWe were out in the yard one day.\n\n Roxanne and I were playing basketball like we usually did. When we stopped to take a break, I saw Judith sitting on a bench looking out in the yard with that same fucking smile on her face.\n\nI shivered at the sight of her just sitting and smiling, like she was waiting to pounce on whoever her new prey.\n\nAnd then a new inmate came into the yard. A girl who we knew was also caught with drugs. Much like Judith, she was tiny; but unlike her, she was meek and scared of her own shadow.\n\nI hoped to god that Judith wouldn’t go for her. She would die if that bitch got her hands on her.\n\nThen I saw Judith beckon the inmate towards her like a siren. I felt my insides twist like snakes as I saw that poor girl walk towards her. I couldn’t just sit there and I ran towards her. I grabbed her wrist and drug her away.\n\nI told her all about Judith and to stay away from her at all costs. The inmate looked at me in disbelief until Roxanne verified my accounts. The inmate nodded and walked off to work out.\n\nI looked back at Judith and felt my blood run cold.\n\nFor the first time, Judith stopped smiling. Instead, she had a look of pure, hot, unadulterated rage on her face for getting in the way between her and her prey.\n\nI swallowed. I have never felt that scared in my life. And I have seen some scary shit.\n\nI turned to Roxanne and she looked like she was going to piss herself. “We’re fucked, Carrie. We’re gonna die.”\n\nLater that night, neither me or Roxanne could sleep. We would just hold each other and wait in anticipation for Judith to come in and either kill us or horribly injure us.\n\nI looked around to see if Judith was there or listening. I saw Judith asleep in her cell, on her side away from us.\n\n“Roxy, we gotta get out of here.” I whispered.\n\n“You crazy?!” Roxanne whispered back.\n\n“I know but I’d rather be on the lam than spend another night with that smiley bitch running around!”\n\nRoxanne gave it some thought. Then she gave an approving nod.\n\nWe both talked quietly, occasionally checking to see if anyone was listening. Once we had a plan, we were ready.\n\nI stood guard while Roxanne looked through the mattress. She pulled out a hairpin and picked the lock with it.\n\nWe both snuck around, avoiding guards and cameras. After hours of painstakingly dodging security, we found the exit.\n\n“We made it.” I sighed, “Now let's get out of here.” \n\nRoxanne gave a nod. \n\nI reached for the door.\n\nAnd then I heard Roxanne scream. \nI turned sharply and saw Roxanne with blood coming from the right side of her head and trying to stop the flow. I felt my heart drop as I saw Judith drenched in blood, hands behind her back, and with Roxanne’s ear in her mouth. Her smile was so wide I could see her gums.\n\n“You thought you were safe? I heard your plan and followed you. Shame I had to take out everyone who got in my way. At least I got what I wanted.” Judith said, her tone still as chipper and light as ever, like this was all normal to her.\n\nJudith pulled out the head of that tiny inmate from behind her back. She tossed it at my feet. I could tell by the way her neck was separated from her body, the inmate’s head was ripped off like an ingrown hair and not cut off.\n\n“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU!?!” I shrieked, asking a question I always wanted answered.\n\nJudith snickered. It wasn’t an evil laugh, but a normal sounding laugh. Like this was all one big joke to her. “You ask too many questions.”\n\nRoxanne pulled out the hairpin and jabbed Judith’s thigh as hard as she could. Judith yelped and grabbed her now bleeding leg. While she was occupied, we both made a run for it back in the prison for either another exit or an officer.\n\nAs we ran, we saw a trail of carnage. Prisoners, guards, staff, all of them horribly mutilated in various gruesome ways with body parts ripped off or disemboweled. How Judith could manage all of that alone was beyond me. \n\nAn officer with blonde hair, who turned the corner, saw us and made a hand signal for us to stop.\n\nRoxanne and I stopped. \n\n“What the hell happened!? It's a bloodbath!”\n\n“Judith did it.” Me and Roxanne said in unison.\n\nThe officer’s eyes widened. “I knew she was crazy, but I didn’t know she could do all of this.”\n\nThe officer saw Roxanne bleeding. She took us to the infirmary and had her patched up.\n\n“I don’t think she’s human. If she is, there is something wrong.” I mumbled, nervously swirling my cup of water.\n\nThe officer nodded as she handed Roxanne a bottle of soda.\n\nAs we sat around, we jumped as we heard banging on the door. The officer took out her gun and aimed it at the door. I stood near Roxanne and held her hand.\nThe door flew off its hinges and Judith stood there, still smiling and the blood now dried, making her look like a corpse.\n\n“Put your hands behind your head! I will shoot you!” The officer commanded.\n\nJudith stood still, seemingly compliant. The officer lowered her gun and was about to pull out her handcuffs.\n\nThen Judith lunged towards her and sliced her arm open with her nails. She turned her sights on me and jumped on me. She grabbed my leg and pulled my calf clean off like a chicken leg.\n\nI shrieked in pain like a banshee. I knew I wasn’t going to survive. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for death.\n\nThen I heard a gunshot and Judith gasping. I opened my eyes to see Judith with her eyes wide with pain. Then two more gunshots, Judith jolting with each one. She fell on her side and went limp.\n\nThe officer was panting with her gun out. She put it back in her holster and fell to her knees in exhaustion.\n\nI blacked out for several days, fading in and out of consciousness. I woke up to Roxanne, the officer, and a doctor with a clipboard.\n\n“Good, you’re awake, Ms King.”\n\nI was a bit out of it because I had just woken up from a coma. “Wha?”\n\n“Luckily we were able to get you here in time. Any longer or you would have died. But we sadly couldn’t reattach your leg.”\n\nI sighed. I looked at the officer. “Is she dead?”\n\nThe officer nodded.\n\nI have never felt happy to hear that someone died before. Thank god I never have to deal with Judith again.\n\nI was discharged and me and Roxanne were released once our sentences were up. \n\nWe later got married and started an organization for youth in the prison pipeline.\n\nEven though she’s dead, I still have night terrors of Judith. Sometimes I fear she is still out there somewhere.\n\nI have heard a rumor that after her autopsy, her body vanished from the mourge.\n\n And then later rumors of people in the area that they sometimes hear giggling and smell blood.",

        "text": "The calm that followed the earthquake was almost as chilling as the event itself. There was nothing soothing or peaceful about it—neither of us dared to move. I bit my lip, slowly turning to face my brother. The look on Casimir's face was completely disturbed, and I was sure mine was the same. Unable to keep his mouth shut for too long, he was the first to speak up again, breaking the silence.\n\n\"What the fuck.\"\n\n\"I… I need to see after the others,\" I choked out, turning towards the woods. \n\n\"I'll come with you,\" my little brother stated readily, and I took note of the gleam of the handgun tucked into his waistband in haste. Heading into the direction of the treeline, we found a familiar figure hovering beneath the snow-laden branches. Aleksei was in his human form, kneeling on the ground, slumped over and palming his face. His shoulders were trembling, and it was only when I got closer that I realized he was trying not to cry. He looked up at us, eyes big and startled like a deer in the headlights.\n\n\"You're here.\" His voice was a low, anguished growl.\n\n\"Of course I'm here.\" I dropped onto my knees in the snow in front of him. \"Why wouldn't I be?\"\n\n\"I felt the earth shake… and I saw the Evening Redness over the meadow. *Arek…*\" Suddenly, his eyes overflowed. He started wiping at them with a fury, turning his head away. \n\n\"Casimir, would you give us a moment?\" I asked with a sidelong glance at my brother. \n\n\"Sure. I'll check on the guards,\" Cas offered, taking off into the thicket and leaving me alone with Aleksei. \n\nI cautiously crawled up to him and placed a tentative hand on his shoulder. \"Uh, okay, big guy… I'm about to hug you. If you have any objections, let me kno—\"\n\nHe pressed himself against me before I could finish my sentence. The embrace lasted only for a second before he snapped out of it, quickly and forcibly disentangling himself. He awkwardly cleared his throat and rose to his feet. \"This… we won't speak of this again.\"\n\n\"Would you mind telling me what exactly just happened?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say exactly. I… it… there's something…\" He faltered, trailing off to take a deep breath. \"Beneath the red meadow. It sleeps. It has been sleeping for a long, long time, completely quiet, too. What in the world happened to make it stir?\"\n\n\"The only thing I can think of is… I did this clairvoyance ritual-thingy with the Bannik and I saw the memories of—\" I paused, holding his gaze as I spoke the name I knew meant so much to him. \"Arkadiusz.\"\n\n\"Arkadiusz,\" he repeated, his tone laced with reverence.\n\n\"M-hm. You, uh… You were very, very cute as a kid.\" I raised my index fingers to the sides of my head, indicating the nubby antlers I'd seen on his infant form. \"What with the little stickies in your hair and all. You were so tiny. Oh… wrong moment to bring that up?\"\n\nHe gave me an irritated snort. \"It never ceases to astound me how someone so well bred and elegant can be this snarky.\"\n\n\"I'm not being snarky, I just genuinely think you were adorable.\"\n\n\"So change snarky to irreverent and my point still stands.\" He was visibly trying to hide the smile that was tugging on the corner of his mouth. As much as he claimed to despise my impertinence, it rather seemed to amuse him. \n\n\"Could you tell me about Arkadiusz, then?\"\n\n\"What do you know so far?\"\n\n\"Well, my mom always used to say that some ancestor of ours immigrated here from a Western Slavic country. And that he built the house and the sauna and brought all the creatures with him. But I wanna hear it from you.\"\n\n\"Fine. Walk with me?\" He offered his arm and I shrugged, stepping closer and folding my hand around its crook. He had to temper the length of his strides for me to be able to keep up.\n\n\"It's been several hundred years since I last made an effort to remember Arkadiusz, so please excuse the hesitation. This isn't exactly easy for me. Arek… Arek liked mysteries. He was a bit of one himself—none of us ever found out much about him, who he used to be, where exactly he came from, why he did the things he did… He simply appeared to all those of us who needed him. I assume you bore witness to the state he found me in. I was small, young, alone and completely hopeless. I had no home, no land to call my own. If he hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have survived. \n\n\"Times were changing back then, you humans were losing their regard for us. When I say us, I'm referring to the collective of beings that I, too, am a part of. Not human, not sacred, not hellish. The church was discouraging you people from respecting us; worse, they were actively pitting them against our kind. They managed to get some of them as far as to try and hunt us down. The ones who had once sought our benevolence and protection now came after us with their pitchforks.\n\n\"Obviously, you little folk are no match for most of us, so the only beings they were strong enough to kill were the weak ones. Less powerful creatures, and… youths and children. Admittedly, most of us come into existence not by birth, but as the ghostly remains of humans, but take me for example—I am the result of the union between a Leshy and his wife. I would have spent my infancy sleeping and waiting, one with the forest, until the wood-demon that fathered me died. I would have. If it hadn't been for the saints taking torches to the trees that were my birthright.\" Aleksei fell silent as his steps slowed. His eyes were downcast, his mouth a stiff line.\n\nI was about to say something when he spoke up again. \"Don't pity me. I don't need your pity, wench.\"\n\n\"You have it anyway, *old man.*\"\n\nThe Leshy sucked in a deep breath. \"Forgive me, I meant no offense.\"\n\n\"It's okay. Go on.\"\n\n\"Well… Arek found me in my darkest hour, and he took me in without thinking twice. He had already gathered quite a group around him. They were nomads of sorts. A strange caravan; we were mistaken for the Wild Hunt several times. We never settled down, and Arek liked that. He led us into the north, then across the sea, then back, forming a good deal of alliances wherever he went. Innumerable creatures sought to follow him. He made enemies, too, of course—his way of living was not exactly safe. But Arek was a skilled fighter. Not just that, he also had all of us on his side. Everyone in our party would have gladly given their life to protect him. He was our… our warden. Our father, almost. Mine, at the very least.\"\n\nI slowly moved my other hand up to pet his arm. \"You really loved him, huh?\"\n\nAleksei laughed, quietly and bitterly. \"I allowed him to call me by a name. Of course I loved him. But I was always aware of his nature, I knew he would not be with me for long. You humans are mayflies. I've outlived Arek and every one of his heirs yet. I'm aging, yes, but I'm still nowhere near eternal sleep. I've never lost sight of that fact.\"\n\n\"So you're saying you didn't get too attached to him?\"\n\n\"I'm saying I tried.\"\n\nI pressed my mouth shut, suddenly feeling the grief he exuded. My hand continued to stroke his shoulder, like it was a separate entity entirely. It was a wonder he hadn't shaken it off yet. \n\n\"Like I said, Arek made quite a few enemies, too, and one of them stood out. It was an entity unlike any other. I believe I used to call it the Evening Redness when I was a boy. It appeared out of nowhere, attaching itself to the wanderer, and it kept turning up wherever we went, even though Arkadiusz never did anything to court its wrath. We tried to figure out what it wanted, but it was futile. We'd see it, and it would see us, but it never communicated any clear intent. But it wanted him. What for, I'll never know. It was toying with him, nearly driving him mad, appearing to us again and again, and every time, it seemed to come closer. Arek was terrified. We all were. Eventually, he packed us all up and we crossed the waters one last time together. He moved us here. We were happy enough to go along with it. It didn't matter to us *where* we went at the time; we'd gotten so used to being a community.\n\n\"Either way, we arrived and we found this place. A patch of land, unclaimed, uninhabited. It was ours. So he started building the house, the sauna for the Bannik, the enclosures for the livestock… He gave me the woods; said they were mine now, that I was going to be the one to uphold order.\" \n\nHe exhaled. \"I finally had a forest. My birthright. Mine and that of all those like me. We can't exist without one. So we were happy, and everything was peaceful, even though we scattered. The water spirits took over the lake, the huldufólk started carving out its hiding spots, I began to stake my claim. Everyone was right where they should be. But Arkadiusz' enemies had followed him, as well. The Kikimora would stomp around the house occasionally and had to be dispelled; the giantess Gryla showed up to try and get her hands on the little one Arkadiusz had fathered… and then the other being showed up. The persistent, ancient one.\"\n\nHe paused, and a strange look passed over his face. Then, he shivered. He actually shivered. \n\"Nobody knew what to do anymore. Nobody knew how to fight it. Fiona, that entity… it's not like me. Not like us. I don't even know if it's of this world. One night, it all came to a head. The being had been standing in the sky for *days*, lying in wait as Arkadiusz had locked himself up in his house. \n\n\"He was going crazy, muttering to himself, shutting himself off even from his son and the woman he'd gotten with child. His final moments must have been pure agony. I don't even know what he was thinking—all I can tell you for certain is that I was sitting in a tree, watching the house when Arek stormed out in nothing but a shirt with a knife in his hand. He went stumbling to the meadow, right where this entity was hovering, and he yelled into the sky like a frenzied animal. Then, all of a sudden, the Evening Redness… how to describe it? It went inside him. It entered his body, and Arkadiusz cried out, then slit his throat.\n\n\"I ran to him when he fell. His blood… his blood was everywhere. It turned all the little flowers red. They've been growing in that same color ever since.\" He paused, letting go of a long breath. “We laid him to rest knowing the Evening Redness was inside of his body. In the bones that are still rotting down below, or whatever is left of him at this point. I don’t know if the Redness has preserved him as a vessel, but it seems as though it’s still here. It seems to be sleeping, and I think you made it stir. What did you do?” The question was not reproachful. \n\n“I think I felt Arkadiusz inside me. He was there for just a moment after I viewed his memories, it was like this weird resonance…” I shook my head, chasing away the uncomfortable recollection. “Then the ground started shaking. My bad, I guess.” I tried to keep my voice light, nervously scratching the back of my head. \n\n“You’re not at fault. I suppose the Redness has become aware of you, then. It was preying on Arek all those years, it makes sense for it to perk up upon sensing his spirit’s presence. I can only make assumptions but it’s possible that it has an interest in your bloodline. Perhaps in its slumber, it has up until now been unaware of any descendants he’s had.”\n\n“But it laid right back down… Is there any chance it’s not going to cause any issues now that I’ve found it?”\n\n“I wish I could give you a definitive answer, my dear lady, but I truly couldn’t say. Who can tell why it followed us in the first place, or why it chose this as its resting place.\"\n\n\"I see. Thank you for telling me all this,\" I said, gently pulling away from him. \n\n\"Pleasure to help. If indeed that was of any help whatsoever.\" He bowed his head, taking a step back. \"I wish to be alone for some time now.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I replied steadily, watching him retreat into the thicket. I made my way back to the house with a heavy heart. I didn't know what to make of it all. I appeared to have located the being Nick was looking for, but I in no way meant to hand it over to him. I owed him, yes, and courting the Devil's wrath was likely not something anyone would ever want to risk. The death of the entity itself would be nothing to mourn. It would rather be like I was avenging the killing of Arkadiusz. But I didn't want to imagine the consequences of the Evening Redness being consumed by the Beast. I didn't want to find out how this would help him \"turn the tide\".\n\nI made my way back to the sauna where I briefly caught up the (understably confused) kindly old spirit. I thanked him for his efforts and stated that I would surely be back soon. Back home, I ran myself a bath. I just wanted to relax, just a little bit. By then, I should have really known that that'd be too much to ask. I undressed and slid into the tub, leaning back with a long sigh. I had left the window wide open, so the cool air was wafting in, grazing my cheeks as the rest of my body was enveloped in the pleasant heat. The soap I'd used had created soft mounds of glistening foam gliding on the warm water's surface, and I idly popped a few of the bubbles with the tip of my finger. Closing my eyes, I let myself sink in further until I was fully submerged. \n\nWhen your head is underwater, everything that's happening outside sounds so strange.\n\nI could hear the water drifting around me, a deep, low droning; outside of the tub, the heater was buzzing, sending the slightest of vibrations to my ears. I could even make out the howling of the wind.\n\nThe bathtub felt like a whole other dimension.\n\nI couldn't help but think of Arkadiusz. How strange that this whole dilemma should have started with wannabe cryptid hunters entering my property when my oldest ancestor, the one who first established said property, was *technically* something of a cryptid hunter himself. Feeling myself run out of breath, I moved to emerge from the depths again, only to find that I… couldn't.\n\nIt took me only two seconds to realize that a large hand was pressing down on the top of my head, preventing me from bobbing up. The panic set in almost immediately. I pushed back against it, struggling and beginning to thrash around. Memories of the Vodyanoy flooded my mind, images of my soaked wedding dress bearing me down as I flailed helplessly appeared before my inner eye. *No.* These weren't the Twin Lakes, I was in my own home, I was supposed to be safe. I reached out blindly, arms piercing the surface as I tried to grab onto whomever was trying to drown me. My fingers met with very, very warm skin, a lower arm which I grabbed onto and began to pull. The other person wasn't giving in, though.\n\nDown below, the sound of laughter reached my ears, abstracted by the water that was still in the way but nevertheless audible—cruel, genuinely amused, merciless.\n\nMy pulse was racing, the need to breathe growing into a sharp sting in my throat. I was growing desperate, nails digging into my assailant's skin to the point where I felt one of them bend and finally break. I screamed in pain, water entering my mouth. *This is it,* I kept thinking, *fuck, this is it—*\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, the pressure was gone and I emerged abruptly, sputtering and coughing before gasping for breath. My chest was tighter than ever, and I greedily gulped down as much cold air as I could. Furiously rubbing the water from my eyes, I blinked at the person standing over me. \n\nUnkempt brown hair. A scarred face. A wide smile.\n\n*Jeremy.*\n\nThe shock was enough to send me scrambling away, pressing my back against the faucet. I was too afraid to move, too afraid to scream—I was quite literally frozen in fear.\n\nThen, my little brother's features began to rearrange, his eyes darkening and his face morphing until I found none other than Old *fucking* Nick staring back at me, the grin very much the same. \n\n\"Hey, Miss Novak.\"\n\nI exhaled loud enough to make him giggle. \n\n\"Scared you there, did I?\" He sat down on the side of the tub, seemingly not minding his sweatpants getting wet. He was already drenched from the struggle, foam thinly running down his dark red skin. \"You really don't like Jeremy anymore, huh? I thought about doing Casimir instead, you know, just to get that extra kick out of you, but the art of shapeshifting is a subtle one and it is infinitely more difficult to imitate someone *that* handsome.\" He shrugged. \"I'm still very much satisfied with your reaction.\"\n\nI glowered at him, still panting.\n\n\"Anyways, I had a feeling you've been making progress, so I figured I'd come over and check up on things.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well. I found it,\" I admitted, chest heaving.\n\n\"Excellent!\" He leaned in, looking delighted. \"How very efficient you are.\"\n\n\"M-hm. You get a lot of things done if you don't waste time creeping into women's bedrooms or torturing your acolytes.\"\n\n\"Are you sassing me, Fiona?\" \n\n\"Appear to be, yes.\"\n\nHe narrowed his eyes at me, smirk unfaltering. \"Well, I'll be damned, she's getting cocky.\" He straightened up. \"Lucky for you, I'm the forgiving type. And it helps that you're not wearing anything.\"\n\nDespite the immediate need to cover up, I kept my eyes trained on him, not so much as flinching. I wasn't going to betray any kind of shame in front of this bastard.\n\n\"So?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"So what?\"\n\n\"You know exactly what I mean. Where is it?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, did I agree I'd tell you *right away*? Because you said you wouldn't stress me out.\"\n\nNick sighed. \"You don't wanna play that game with me, forest bride. I *invented* that game. Where is it?\"\n\nMy mouth was a thin, short line. I shrugged my shoulders.\n\n\"Fucking— okay. *Okay.* I do take care of mine, no one is gonna tell you otherwise.\"\n\n\"Reckon they wouldn't be alive to do so.\"\n\nNick tilted his head in consideration. \"Yeah, well. Either way. I'm feeling generous. I know you have some stuff that needs sorting out, so I'm actually going to be nice about this and wait until you're ready.\" He chuckled. \"It's funny—I always thought *I* had Daddy issues. Anyways, you take care of that, and I… I'll just be in touch. I *will* be. You can count on that. Meanwhile, I'm just going to have to prove my good will to you, won't I? No harm, no foul. Some folks just need convincing. And I think I've got your number.\" He tapped me on the shoulder, and then, one second to the next, he'd disappeared. \n\nI sat in silence for a beat before hearing Cas' voice call out to me. \"Fi! Are you in the bathroom? You might wanna come downstairs!\"\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe start\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was poor and had all but accepted the inevitability of my upcoming homelessness. I kept the restaurant open late one night in an attempt to get better business with the late-night drunks and punks. im sure you are expecting some klesha of a bright full moon or something, but no, it was a cloudy night, and I could not see the astral body. I looked it up later, though, waxing gibus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was almost midnight; sadly, the late shift left me with as few customers as the morning shift. But that changed when the old cowbell above my door rang. \" a customer, holy shit! And here I am sitting at the bar drinking Kentucky Delux out of the bottle like a homeless man, well not far off, im sure he will leave when he sees there is no one here.\" I thought this to myself, but my inner monologue was mistaken. Heavy boots stomped their way to my side, and the stranger plopped forcefully on the stool next to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this turn of events, I let out a breath and put on my best; how can I help you smile, then stood up, facing away from the patron. Before I could take my first step toward the other side of the bar to take their order, the \"person\" spoke. \"service, please,\" the voice was guttural and alien. It was like someone shoved broken glass and an old trumpet down their maw and then tried to hack up the words while coughing blood, rust, and glass shards!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned to face the customer only to feel my mouth morph from a shit-eating grin to a gaping jaw! It was horridness in the chair; it hunched over but still sat over 6 feet tall! The thing must have had to stoop down in order to get into the building! It had four limbs, but its hands only had three fingers, no thumbs. Its skin was gray and rubbery; it had short hair up top cut into a fade with a strange sigil cut into the side. That part looked cool not going to lie. The strangest thing was the tentacle-like protrusions atop its back, hanging down to the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gazed at the freakish thing for Cthulu knows how long before it turned and met my stair. Its eyes were rather pretty, all 5 of them. Light blue like ice sitting atop a winter lake. Before I could make a move, it did; it reached out one of its hand-like things and opened its finger-like things to show me! Three green bills, in particular, three, one hundred dollar bills.\n\n\"strawberry daiquiri, please.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npart 1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point during the night, my front door goes from a regular entrance for normal humans to a portal of sorts. For not-so-normal creatures, freaky, right? Anyway, these customers have started showing up more often than my human regulars, well, regular; shut up!\n\nIn particular, I should talk about my first repeat customer. He is one of my best and nicest patrons. He is a six-foot-tall sweetheart of a swamp monster named wegrar. I call him by the nickname Reggie; he seems to like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met Reggie on a slow rainy night around 2 am I was sitting behind the bar drinking a porter from Breckenridge, Colorado. he walked in covered in mud, dripping from head to toe. Before he could make it past the door, I let out a piercing \"oy\" This shrill sound seemed to startle him since he paused his motion and met my eyes. I silently pointed at one of the many signs near the door. The one that read, \"please wipe your feet.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe gentlemonster did as requested without protest, and He even tried to pad the water off his slippery green body. After this, he dragged his feet toward my par, pointed to my porter, and claimed in a higher-than-expected voice, \"that black thing your drinking looks good. How did you get a glass of my toilet water? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no choice but to let out a belly laugh before asking if they had porter beer where he is from; he informed me they did not.\n\nI asked if he would like to try one, assuring him it tasted at least twenty percent better than his toilet water. It was his turn to let out a chuckle before informing me he would love to try it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I didnt have the vanilla porter on tap, but I did have the coco jones by black raven in Washington state. Before I could even set the flight glass on the table, he had taken it out of my hands and thrown it back like a shot of cheap vodka! Reggie smacked his lips a few times before speaking inquisitively, \"reminds me of coconut\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this proclamation, I couldn't help but smile before asking if he would like a glass? He replied in the affirmative, requesting a tall. I pulled out a chilled 22-ounce glass and began doing what any good salesman would do; I asked if he would like a menu. He waved me off silently and commenced looking around the bar. \"How many beers do you have on tap,\" he questioned. We have 85 beers, 6 hard ciders, or just ciders if you are from somewhere other than the united states. And a few soft drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"If you have any more porters, id like to try them.\" he lay a small bag on the table; id looked at the contents and found it was filled with tiny yellow coins that shinned in the light. I gazed at them, almost forgetting his beer. It began to overfill, and if not for the cold frothy liquid dripping onto my hand, who knows how much id have wasted!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I snapped out of my stooper, cleaned the glass, and sat it with a salted coster in front of my guest without breaking eye contact with the bag. \"this could salve everything if it's real.\" I thought to myself. \"whatever, this is a problem for future eros. I have a customer who is already done with his 22-ounce.\" I looked up to see a long blue tongue lapping at the suds of an empty beer mug.",

        "text": "Okay so this is where we tell the stories, right? Because I’ve got one and no one who matters believes me and all my goddamn coworkers just keep telling me to shut up about it! But they don’t GET it! THEY don’t have to put up with the cold spots and everything!\n\nUgh, sorry. Let me start this from the top, I’m just really upset. I need someone to actually hear me, so I stop feeling like I’m going crazy.\n\nSo, I’m a guy, not gonna say my exact age but early 20s, and I work in this hotel. Her name’s Astoria. It. Its name’s Astoria. Everyone at work calls it a her, sorry. I do it there too, but it’s a goddamn IT, okay? She or her is way too human! It’s like that whole thing way back when, where people called all the fairy baby stealers the “Good People” because they were scared of insulting them.\n\nAnyways, I started working there like… maybe a year ago? And it’s always been weird. When my coworkers showed me around for the first time, I noticed they were all concerned about me. Which was kinda nice, not gonna lie. You get treated like crap at so many workplaces, especially as the newbie. But people at Astoria were really nice to me. Just sometimes babied me a bit much, and in really weird ways.\n\nFor example - right, I forgot to explain. I’m with the cleaning crew, right? Basically, I’m a male maid. Anyways, when I went out with the other maids for cleaning, you know how often in hotels it’s the norm to knock and announce yourself before you enter a room for cleaning, even if it’s supposed to be empty? So, being new, I forgot that once or twice. Always because the guests had already checked out, so I just didn’t consider that anyone could still be in there. And no one was, so - no big deal, right? A normal person would probably give me a reminder and keep it at that.\n\nYeah, my cleaning partners didn’t keep it at that. They’d freak out, drag me out of the room, then apologize to the empty rooms and close the door. Some would really yell at me. But never before waiting for something, all tensed up and everything. If I tried saying anything, even to apologize, they’d shush me really aggressively.\n\nThe first few times, I was too distracted to realize what they were waiting for. I think it was Yana who actually toned down the aggression enough to just put her finger on her lips and tap her ear when I tried to speak, letting me know that I needed to listen. So I shut up and listened. And it was real quiet. Like… It’s a hotel, right? There are quieter times, but usually there’s some hustle and bustle somewhere going on, and the building isn’t brand new either, so you can often hear it settling or some wind whistling through somewhere or pipes banging or gurgling. But in that moment, there was absolutely nothing. Like the place was on mute.\n\nThat was the first time I felt all the strange sensations Astoria makes you feel. I mean, I think it’s her. It. Like… it gets really cold. The kind that really creeps into your skin. Like when you had to work with cold water while the heating is down, and you just can’t really warm up after. And there was this feeling of someone glaring at me. With some real anger behind it, too.\n\nAnd then it suddenly stopped and all the sound was back, along with the normal temperature, and Yana took a deep breath of relief and gave me a small frown and a reminder to always, ALWAYS announce myself. No. Matter. What.\n\nSo yeah, that’s the kind of stuff that happened.\n\nI really tried to keep track of the small rules we had to adhere to. None of them were even too out there. There were some rooms that were off limits, some signs to know how some rooms were off limits for a day or some hours only, and naturally you had to use the right cleaning products for everything. I gotta say, I was always surprised by how little the maids there slacked off, and by how much the bosses paid attention to having enough of us there and giving us enough time for our work. We were always enough to go in pairs, which is just nicer and safer, and we always had the time and materials to really get stuff nice and clean. If it weren’t for the weird moments, I think I would prefer staying in that hotel myself over others. Nice and clean.\n\nBut like… sue me but I’m just not as anal about doing my best job all the time as the others were. First off, so what if I don’t do it perfectly today? If I skip a step today, someone else is gonna do it tomorrow. It’s not like it won’t get done or anything! And secondly, listen, I’m just not passionate about being the best bang for my bosses buck. If they wanted to have it done perfectly, they’d do it themselves.\n\nMy coworkers didn’t see it my way though. They always told me I was going to get them in trouble, even though no one ever supervised us (and I wouldn’t slack off under supervision either, I’m not an idiot!). Said we had to look out for each other. After a while, most of them just refused to work together with me, which really hurt. So that’s when I got picked up by Maria.\n\nMaria definitely had some migration background. Maybe something South American? Or Eastern European? Never managed to really untangle that accent of hers. But she was mad pretty for someone her age, like… in her 40s, maybe even approaching 50? Like yeah, her face had some wrinkles, but they all looked to be from smiling and laughing. She smiled and laughed a lot, in general. And hummed. She seemed really happy there at the hotel.\n\nI never really knew how to feel about her. I mean, on one hand, I kinda resented her a little bit. The others had really high standards about their work already, but Maria? She went above and beyond, like she was hoping to get a top grade in hotel cleaning! Not only did she really pay attention to every little detail, I even saw her bring in some of her own cleaning products! The ones provided to us weren’t good enough for her precious Astoria in her opinion! Imagine spending your own money on work material! Couldn’t be me.\n\nShe arrived early and stayed late, she never actually TOLD any of us that our work sucked, but got caught constantly fixing up stuff we hadn’t done to her standards… that’s just really annoying after a while, you know? No one likes that one ideal little worker bee.\n\nBut at the same time, she was just… nice. Again, when everyone else just wrote me off because they said I couldn’t even listen to the easiest instructions, Maria took me on as her partner all the time. And it’s not like she had no alternatives. Everyone loved working with Maria. Probably because she loved picking up anyone else’s slack, but they also always said that it was “safer”. Yana once told me: “Astoria tolerates us. But she loves Maria.”\n\nMaria loved Astoria more though, I’d reckon. I mean for one - that Thing can’t love. But Maria… Maria had a lot of love inside that big heart of hers. And yeah, a lot of that was spent on that hotel.\n\nWhen we worked together, she’d always point out small details to me and tell me about historical facts and anecdotes about Astoria. She could gush about this place for hours on end. And TO it, too. I heard her say stuff like “Oh no, look at what they did to your sheets!” or “And now your windows here are nice and clean again! Do you like it?” constantly. She didn’t even seem to care if I heard it too.\n\nBut alright, enough about Maria. I should get to the point. To the day I actually realized what a horrible situation I’m in.\n\nMaria and I were going through our rooms again, and that day we also had some that had patrons in it. This happened a lot to the pairs I was part of, because most of the maids were these little five foot nothing ladies. In empty rooms, that’s no issue. But if a guest happens to be somewhat unsavory for any reason, be it an angry Karen or a grabby drunkard, those little ladies seem like prime prey for them. Having a guy along helps, even if I’m pretty average all things considered.\n\nSo one of the rooms had the guest, some middle aged guy, walk in while I was cleaning the bathroom with the door only cracked a little and Maria tending to the bed. I was listening to music on my headphones, so I didn’t even notice him at first.\n\nI remember how I was turned away from the door, taking a little break to scroll through the playlist on my phone, when the music cut off with the worst burst of static I’ve ever heard in my life. I immediately pulled the headphones out, but I didn’t even get to cuss about it before I heard the voice’s in the adjacent room.\n\nSomething about the tones made the hairs stand up on my neck, and had me freeze for a moment before I quietly crept towards the door to peek out. I saw the guest standing in front of the bed, between Maria and the path to the door. Maria was completely tensed up, eyes constantly darting towards the door in an attempt to find a way past the guy. She was still smiling, but it was so deeply uncomfortable, and her hands were raised as if she hoped it would protect her from him.\n\n“Come on, sweetheart. You don’t need to be scared. I might even give you a nice little bonus to stock up your piddly little salary for the month! How about it? Twenty Euros? Fifty?” He cooed while trying to inch closer to her. Poor Maria was backed up against the bed frame, her hands trembling as she shook her head repeatedly.\n\n“Thank you, Sir. But no, Sir. I’m in a relationship, Sir.” She stammered out, notably struggling to string the words together. It was like the stress of the situation set back her language skills. I don’t blame her - I remember my own mind going blank too. Like… everything was suddenly so real. I couldn’t think straight.\n\nWhen her eyes met mine for a long moment, most of the gears in my brain started turning again. It was like she was begging me for help. I was behind the guy, so maybe she thought I could just burst out and tackle him down.\n\nBut like - what if he had a weapon? Hell, even if he didn’t, he could probably throw quite a punch. I was fucking terrified. Like, if someone has the guts to do this, they won’t hesitate to throw down, I’m sure!\n\nMy heart jumped into my neck when he half turned his head to see what she’d been looking at, but before he could find the crack in the bathroom door, the lights in it flickered and went out. I was so frozen that I’m pretty sure I didn’t even breathe when he looked in my direction. And I guess together with the darkness compared to the bright room he stood in, he couldn’t spot me at a quick glance.\n\nMaria, bless her heart, tried to seize the opportunity to dive past him. But he was faster. He had her wrist in a tight grip in an instant and tossed her on the bed. And then he was above her, a hand pressed to her mouth while she thrashed and cried.\n\n“Shhhhhh baby. I’ll make it worth your time!” He said, making me almost dry heave from the grease of it. Disgusting. If only someone did something!\n\nI had to press a clammy hand against the doorframe, feeling like the ground beneath me was tilting. It felt like I was going to tip over and fall out of the door any moment, and I think I could even hear the walls around me creak. I saw the guy’s free hand wander to his belt, and I saw my own breath in the cold air. Some things fell over, there were some chemical smells in my nose.\n\nAnd then the door slammed shut and the noise erupted from the other side.\n\nIt was absolutely deafening. Screams, cries, begs, all above a cacophony of creaking floors and walls, cracking concrete, and the wet noises of something firm being crunched into small pieces. I heard him gargle and weep, and then another, final wet crunch cut him off.\n\nAnd only Maria’s weeping remained.\n\nThe rest was quiet again. The kind of quiet from the days when I effed up.\n\nI was trembling so badly, my own teeth shattering should have overpowered the sobs next door. But it didn’t. Not even my attempts to call out for Maria or to knock on the door made any sound.\n\nI fell onto my four letters, utterly knocked off balance still, and realized that the floor was completely wet with something. I could only fish my phone out of the liquid with some soundless swears. For a moment I dreaded the stickiness of blood or something, but when I carefully sniffed my phone and the air, I noticed it was just cleaning agents.\n\nAnd then I realized that oh shit, it was different cleaning agents.\n\nThe scents in my nose were definitely some that were not supposed to be mixed like that. Maybe that was why I felt so weird. I definitely felt lightheaded and nauseous.\n\nNothing an open window can’t fix, I thought and reached for the door handle.\n\nThe door didn’t budge.\n\nLet me be clear. It wasn’t locked. I never locked it and you could only lock it from the inside. When I tried the lock, it was in the open position. The goddamn hotel just didn’t want me out.\n\nAnd it didn’t want Maria to hear me, either. I tried calling for her. I tried banging on the door. I threw myself against it with all my might, even though at this point, that wasn’t much. But none of that made any noise. My phone didn’t turn on right, the screen only ever briefly lighting up for a split second like someone pressed the off button the moment I tried to turn it on. I could only watch the battery drain a huge chunk each time until the damn thing died for good.\n\nFor a moment, I almost accepted my fate. I didn’t understand why this place wanted me dead all of a sudden, but honestly… part of me was just glad that I didn’t have to go the same way that scumbag did. I remember feeling really faint, some parts of my skin burning from, I guess, some chemical reactions against it, my back propped against the door as I hoped to just pass out soon.\n\nAnd then the door opened, letting me flop out of the room. I laid on my back, staring up into Maria’s tired face. She was still trying to sniffle back some snot from crying as hard as she had.\n\n“Go home.” She told me after a while. I tried to reach up, to comfort and thank her, but you should have seen how she recoiled from me. Like I was slimy and disgusting.\n\n\n“Please. Go home, NOW.” She reiterated, not even looking at me. Then she turned to leave.\n\nDespite still feeling woozy, I scrambled to my legs in record time to run past her out of the room. I didn’t want to be in that place for even a minute longer! Somehow, I made it all the way downstairs, out of the hotel and to my car, even home, without any issues.\n\nI wish I could just have quit on the spot, but, you know… gotta eat. I took sick leave for a week or so, but I had to go back eventually.\n\nMaria won’t look at me anymore, but bless her heart, she still works with me. She doesn’t leave my side at all at the hotel. No smile for me, and she keeps reminding me to find a new job, but she also doesn’t ever leave me alone in a room.\n\nI’m glad she doesn’t. Because whenever she absolutely has to, it gets cold again. And I can feel that glare, and the quiet.\n\nNo idea what that Thing’s problem with me is. But I’m pretty sure that back in that bathroom, the door wouldn’t have opened for anyone else. And I shudder to think what’ll happen if I have to rely on anyone else to keep me safe from this Thing now.\n\nI tried to tell my coworkers, but Yana is the only one who didn’t just shut me down and walk off. She just gave me this wide eyed look, like *I* did something wrong somehow. And she told me that I’m lucky Maria is too nice to agree with the hotel. And that I better get out soon. Great. Really helpful.\n\nAt least she told me I probably wouldn’t need to be afraid of whatever happened to that guest. Although my relief was short lived when Yana added something on to that.\n\n“She normally makes it look like an accident. Don’t let her run out of options again.”\n\nI hear McDonald’s is always hiring. Those need cleaning too, right?",

        "text": "[Part 1 (\"The Uncanny Valley Is A Real Place\")](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z4msuf/the_uncanny_valley_is_a_real_place/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI groaned as I struggled through the dense forest in the pouring rain. The sun had set a few hours ago, and I was now completely lost in the forest. Ever since the incident at the Uncanny Valley, I got into hiking to take my mind off things. \n\n*I should’ve listened to those hikers telling me to turn back.*\n\nSuddenly, a bright and beautiful star became apparent. It was incredibly close and impossibly bright, I didn’t know much about astronomy, but I assumed it just had to be the North Star. \n\n“Well, at least I have some sense of direction now..” I muttered to myself.\n\nI began to follow the direction of the star, but I started noticing it was exhibiting odd behaviors.  The star was moving around way too much, and it wasn’t twinkling. I grew suspicious, but stopped when I realized how crazy it was to be suspicious  of a star.  I ventured on, still following the star. \n\nI began to hear ragged breathing. The breathing sent me into an extremely familiar yet horrific panic response. \n\n*Why am I getting the uncanny valley response..? Oh please don't tell me..”*\n\nSuddenly, the star went completely dark. \n\n“What the hell..” I muttered to myself in a mix of fear and confusion.\n\nLightning struck the ground in front of me, illuminating the woman from the TSA line, holding a flashlight and calmly sitting atop a tree.  she looked different, though. Her eyes were red and crazed, her outfit was tattered and ragged, she looked beast-like. But although she looked different, the panicked uncanny valley response I received from her face felt no different than the one I was familiar with.\n\nI cursed and booked it through the forest, not caring about all the branches I was running through. \n\nLightning struck once more, illuminating the woman calmly laying down directly in front of me, as if to mock me. \n\nI swiftly turned around and ran. I heard the woman let out a horrific and uncanny roar,  and started to run behind me not long after. Adrenaline was surging through my veins, nothing could stop me from running, except for the woman of course. Suddenly, I was tackled down to the ground. I screamed in pain as the woman  began to gnaw at my shoulder and scrape her incredibly sharp tongue across the wound.\n\nI tried to fight back, but my legs and arms were completely pinned down.\n\nA roar echoed throughout the forest, and in an instant, the woman seemed scared, as if she’d been caught, and stopped torturing me.\n\n“*THIS IS OUR TERRITORY AFTER NIGHTFALL. I WILL LET YOU OFF WITH A WARNING, BUT NEVER COME BACK.”* The  woman stated in an incredibly uncanny and inhuman voice.\n\nThe  woman hopped off of me and i layed there in shock and fear as I heard her run off into the forest and let out a roar. \n\n*What the hell are the uncannies doing in this forest? And why are they beast-like now?*\n\nI scurried to my feet and looked around, trying to find some sort of clue of how to get out of this forest.\n\n“What the hell are you doing here?”\n\nI heard a familiar but panic inducing voice call out. I jumped and started to scan everywhere surrounding me, and eventually I locked eyes with the familiar face of the individual who had saved me from the Uncanny valley.  He looked inhuman and beastlike, but nowhere near as much as the woman. \n\n“Sapien? What are you doing here?” I asked, confusedly. \n\n“Wow, I never thought we would cross paths again!” he responded in an inhuman tone.\n\nThe panic response had not set in, but deep down I knew I could trust this Uncanny. \n\n“Anyways, shortly after you left a huge protest broke out. The uncannies were getting tired of living in that boring old place for millions of years.. We settled on venturing into the world, and naming our territories. This right here is the Uncanny Forest, which is the most populated territory by the Uncannies at the moment.  The uncanny valley is mostly empty now, but a few handful of them stayed there.” Sapien explained.\n\nPanic completely enveloped me, from both his voice and what he had explained. \n\n“So, they could be *anywhere?”* I asked him.\n\n“Yes, but you don’t have to worry. They can’t hurt you, remember, I granted you complete safety.” Sapien stated.\n\n“But, I was literally just attacked by the woman!” I stated frustratedly.\n\n“Yeah, who do you think stopped her?” He asked before pointing at himself.\n\n“But that still means that any of them could break the rules and torture me if they wanted?” I asked.\n\n“Well, unfortunately, yes, but very few would choose to do that considering the severe punishment they face.”  Sapien stated before sighing.\n\n“What’s the punishment?” I asked, eager to know the answer.\n\n“Well, our leaders will send them to their own personal hell. Most of the time that personal hell is them being tortured by humans for what feels like millions of years to them, but is really only a few seconds for everyone else. Only a few uncannies have received such punishment, but when they do, they are never the same.” Sapien explained.\n\n“You never mentioned anything about leaders.. Who leads the Uncannies?” I asked curiously. \n\n“Well, we have a government-like system in place, although it's very flawed.. We have had the same executive chief for 50,000 years now. I guess I just forgot to tell you about it last time, my bad.”\n\n“Oh, well alright then.. Do you know how to get out of here?” I asked. \n\n“The forest? Uhh, here.”\n\nhe touched my shoulder and suddenly my world began to morph and swim into red demonic colors, and just as suddenly I was right next to my car. I looked around, but Sapien wasn’t there. \n\n*Huh, didn’t know they could do that. Pretty cool.*\n\nI got in my car and drove home. I was now stressed about the possibility of running into another uncanny, but I felt some comfort from the fact that not most of them would choose to harm me.",

And in the wake of her death, she has begged me to leave her.\n\nShe told me through stiff lips that she didn’t want me to watch as her body broke down and rotted.\n\nAnd I told her I couldn’t leave and I won’t.\n\nIt’s my fault that she is dead, just like it’s my fault we couldn’t get away.\n\nI wish I could say she looks asleep, but that would be a lie.\n\nI wish I could bury her in the garden underneath the weeping tree, but she has always hated the thought of being put into the ground, and I don’t have the time or strength.\n\nThey’re so close now. I can hear them scratching at the door.\n\nHow is it possible that all that you’ve known can be erased in seconds?\n\nI watched as my neighbors died and listened to the wail of sirens, the explosions that lit the night.\n\nNadine sits up and cocks her head at me quizzically. Her face is smeared with vomit, and her eyes are cloudy and gray.\n\n“Why are you still here?” She whispers to me. “I’m gone, but you are not. Why are you here?”\n\nI want to tell her I’m sorry for everything I did and failed to do. But I can only look at her and hope my eyes tell her what my mouth refuses to say.\n\nI am sorry that I hurt you. You were my everything.\n\n If love had a name, it would be yours. \n\nI call these monsters my nightmares.\n\nThey look like an amalgamation of all the monsters that have haunted me since birth. In them, I see my past, my future, and the present. I created and fed them, but I wasn’t enough.\n\nI did everything they asked of me.\n\nI wrote about them and drew them in ink, graphite, and dust.\n\nI painted them in shades of black and splashes of red.\n\nI gave them life, and in return, they paid me with death, and the canvas I created paid me in blood.\n\nAfter I broke my leg, Nadine dragged me into the room, barricaded the door, and pushed pill after pill through my lips.\n\nThe last time I saw her alive, her dark eyes shimmered, and her tears left silver tracks on her face.\n\nI know she meant to kill me because she knew we were dead and rather it end this way than be ripped apart.\n\n“I wanted you to be with me,” Nadine sighs as she strokes my arm. “I want to wake up with you in another world.”\n\nI knew that, but I also knew that this was purposeful. They wanted to be what killed me because I birthed them.\n\nI can see the world from this room.\n\nI used to sit by the window and watch stars form constellations and sit weightless in the galaxy. I would trace the clouds and divine the figures that emerged from them.\n\n“Why did you create these things?” She had sobbed as it began. “Why didn’t you fight?”\n\nI hadn’t wanted to; I had screamed. But if I hadn’t, I would have become what they are. I would be the nightmare, and I would have painted the world with blood, and I wouldn’t have been able to stop.\n\n“Then you should have died. You should have sacrificed yourself.”\n\nAnd that’s when I slapped her, and, in return, she pushed me down the stairs. I heard the crack as my leg broke and was deluged by blinding white pain. \n\nShe apologized fervently, but I didn’t deserve it because she was right.\n\nEverything that has happened is my fault.\n\nThe city burns, and there is ash in my throat, and amongst the flames, the sun is rising.\n\nMy time is ending.\n\nMy nightmares recede as morning comes, and I know they feel its arrival because the door rattles, and the scratching has become furious. I will not make it another day, and that’s fine with me.\n\n“Why are you doing this?” Nadine whispers from the bed. “You need to try harder.”\n\nNo. There’s no point.\n\nAfter I woke up and found Nadine, I gathered my strength and found my sketchbooks, a lighter, and candles.\n\nI spread my sketches across the floor, on the bed, on me, and I held a red candle in my hand; I am a symbolic idiot to the very end.\n\nI’ve finally figured it out, and I’m sorry it took so long. I apologize to the town and its people; I tell Nadine I love her and do not blame her.\n\nAnd to you, I urge you to take this as a warning because if this doesn’t work, then that means they will come for you.\n\nYou can do whatever you want with this information if you wish.\n\nI am sorry for the destruction that I have brought, but at least you have this warning to prepare yourselves.\n\n“You should have left,” Nadine whispers over and over. “You should have left. You should have left. You should have died.”\n\nI know.\n\nThe candle has been lit, and I watch as the flame dances and the wax drips down my fingers like bloody tears.\n\nThey’re closer than they have ever been. They bang on the door so hard that the entire house shakes. Strong hands scrabble to remove the barricades.\n\nMy eyes are so heavy, and I can’t move. I entwine my fingers with Nadine’s, and I drop the candle.\n\nI watch as the fire engulfs the sun, and I hear the door burst open.\n\nNadine strokes my face with a long, frozen finger, and I close my eyes and remember what a beautiful life we had. How much joy she brought to me, and I hope I brought as much to her.\n\nI’ve learned that to love is to burn, and to die is to be consumed. And now that I have made my peace and sang my prayers, with the sun, I will sleep.\n\nI am so sorry.",

Someone does not appreciate that I am writing this down, sharing my experiences, letting you read the words published by Douglas Ray Cleavon and the brave individuals who helped him bring Grouse Springs to light. This will be my final word to you, dear reader, before I hide myself in some deep place where I may be safe. Take care.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Blast Radius: An investigation into the tragedy and coverup of Grouse Springs\n\nBy Douglas Ray Cleavon\n\nPublished August 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part One: an Interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10m0ybj/i_found_evidence_of_a_nuclear_accident_that_never/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part Two: the Autopsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10oyn4d/i_found_evidence_of_a_nuclear_accident_that_never/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part Three: a Letter**\n\nI received an envelope in my mailbox, the day after I spoke with Cole. It had no address, and when I asked my neighbors, nobody could recall seeing anyone near my home that day. Inside was a typed letter, along with a video cassette. The author of the letter included a note that I do not release this video publicly, so her identity is not revealed, but she has permitted me to include screencaps. I watched the video in its entirety and have no doubt of its veracity. The event as Grouse Springs was not a nuclear accident\n\nI will let the letter speak for itself.\n\nMr. Cleavon,\n\nProject SKIPJACK *was* a power plant, that much is true. The city of Grouse Springs did get its electricity from whatever they were doing down in the bowels of the building known to the public as the Grouse Springs Nuclear Power Plant. It wasn’t my job to understand how, though. I was just there to provide security. Keep people out, they told me. Keep people in too, if it came to that. \n\nI’d been on details like this before. They’d tell you just enough that you’d get a feel for what to do in an emergency. You learned early on not to ask too many questions. \n\nThings were bad before June 23rd, but the public didn’t know about it. Way back when the power plant first opened, in 2008, a kid went missing from a neighborhood close by. He was only four or five, the same age as my son at the time. Later, sometimes people would see flashing lights in the woods, or cigar-shaped objects hovering in the sky. The higher ups did a real good job of covering it all up. A scientist had been killed, too, in the laboratory. I didn’t have to work that cleanup, but my buddies who did came back up a bit shellshocked. One of them requested to transfer, after that, but it wasn’t allowed to happen. He didn’t survive the accident.\n\nIt started in the afternoon. We were told that’s when the technicians would rotate shifts, so we’d know to be extra alert. The main lights went off, and the emergency light system came on. The alarms didn’t start yet, though. They wanted to wait to see if it could get it back under control. \n\nThis was relayed to me and my partner, I’ll call him Delta, over radio by the head technician. No worry yet, they said. By time the fire started, the alarms still hadn’t gone off, so we radioed back. No word. \n\nSomeone I didn’t recognize came into the security building and told us it was code red out there, and the entire security team needed to be deployed to the plant, where the main power core was contained. We weren’t told what it was, just that we needed to help survivors put out the fire, and that under no circumstances could anyone found at the plant leave without checking their identification. Even in the middle of a meltdown. If they didn’t have ID, we were told to kill them.\n\nWe got suited up. Our core team was Delta, and other people on the detail I’ll call Gamma, Beta, ad Epsilon. I had body armor, a side arm, a knife, and a helmet. I was also tasked with keeping record of the accident, on behalf of the researchers, so my helmet had a camera. Our fire suppression team went out ahead of us. \\[[Image One](https://imgur.com/a/yITs548)\\] They *were* successful in putting the fire out, here, so I have no idea how it ended up spreading to the rest of the city.\n\nIt initially played out like a standard search-and-rescue. Many of the rooms were hollowed out by the fire, charred black. Smoky. It smelled strange, though, like someone had been spraying hair product. There was a lot of searching, but not a lot of rescuing. We cleared about three rooms before there was any sign of life.\n\nDown the hallway, there was a figure. \\[[Image Two](https://imgur.com/a/zoPro92)\\] It was small, and it looked like it was coated in dark grease, or oil, or something. I couldn’t tell if it was facing us or facing away because whatever was dripping off of it was so thick its head was completely obscured. Epsilon called out, “Hey! You there,” but whoever it was didn’t respond. They just ran off, feet slapping against the floor, down some random hallway. I wanted to pursue, but Delta got me back on track. \n\n“Remember,” he said over the earpiece, “We gotta get to the core.”\n\nI nodded, and we kept going. There was ambient noise, as we got closer, like a crowd of people talking and laughing at a party in a nearby room. Sometimes lights would go on and off in other rooms and we’d look and nothing would be there. \n\nAbout halfway down the staircase to the basement level, where the core was, one of the walls burst. A long, skinny arm reached through a hole and started groping around with an oversized hand. It was burnt to a crisp, but whatever it was, it was reaching excitedly like a kid getting the last Skittle out of the bag. Gamma and Epsilon fired at it, but they either didn’t hit it or it didn’t care, because it picked Gamma up and it *squeezed*, before anyone could help. \n\nThe thing played with his limp body through the hole in the wall, tapping Gamma’s feet against the floor and shaking him up and down so his arms were flopping around. And I swear to God, when that hand squeezed him to death, the only thing that came out of Gamma’s body was strawberry ice cream.\n\nWe ran before the rest of whatever the hell that thing was decided it wanted to grab anyone else, too, sprinting down the stairs. Dark splotches were smeared on the wall, sometimes there was an arm or a leg sticking out. At one point we passed a human face lodged in the wall, which just wept and wept. I don’t remember if it was Epsilon or if it was Delta that put a bullet in his head. \n\nThe last flight of stairs was too damaged to access, so we had to cross the first floor to find the alternate staircase on the other side of the building. I was hoping maybe we’d actually find someone we could help, here, but I was wrong. \n\nIt sounded like people were having a conversation all around us, but not one that made any sense; the voices were cackling, howling, whimpering. The sharp tangy smell from earlier was becoming overpowering. It felt like someone was touching the bottom of my boots. Epsilon turned to me to say something, but before he could his tongue fell out of his mouth and onto the ground. \n\nThen his fingers started falling off. His eyes dropped out of his head. He was thrashing and moaning; blood made the floor slick enough that he slipped and fell. I knew it was Delta that took the shot, this time. Epsilon didn’t die, though. He just kept falling apart all over the floor.\n\nDelta and I kept going, dutifully forward. Maybe we could stop whatever this was, if we just made it there. \n\nNoise from Epsilon’s collapse must have gotten attention, because back near the entrance to the first floor, a door creaked open. It was so loud that Delta and I turned around to look. It was a woman.\n\nShe peeked her eyes out from the now-open doorway. They were open manically wide, the whites visible even at a distance. She disappeared for a moment, and after a pause, slunk out of the doorway. She was grinning, or grimacing, maybe. It was hard to tell. Her expression wasn’t lining up with the sheer unhinged malice she seemed to exude. Shoulders slung low, head facing up, I could tell that if she got her hands on us, that would be it.\n\nIt was me. It couldn’t be me, but it was. She was nude, and every mole on my body, every crease in my skin, even my c-section scar, were all perfectly mirrored on hers. Slowly, she approached. Behind her, it seemed like she left a shadow, solid almost, a faint after-image doubled over where she had just been. \n\nShe waved, when she saw us staring. We were in shock. That’s the only way I could justify it to myself when Delta waved back.\n\nThe woman went into a sprint, running towards us at a speed I’ve never been capable of achieving. I fired my sidearm and saw that I had shot her straight through the forehead. She stopped for a moment, a line of after-images slinging back behind her, before they snapped together and she was left wholly unharmed. \n\nWe just had to beat her to the stairs. We just had to get to the core. Delta and I turned and started moving as fast as we could towards the stairs. She got closer and closer, and I could tell she was laughing through her clenched teeth. \n\nRight at the staircase, she was on us. \\[[Image Three](https://imgur.com/a/9DzZleP)\\] I looked and she was there and I could feel her hot breath on my neck. I didn’t realize I was doing it but my feet were still moving, taking me down towards the basement. She was tearing apart Delta with her teeth. He didn’t even scream, just looked at me like big eyes like he didn’t know what was going on as she pulled loop after loop of intestines out of his torso.\n\nThe basement was a slaughterhouse. \\[[Image Four](https://imgur.com/a/emcNQa3)\\] Carcasses swung on hooks from the ceiling. Some animal was alive, dragging itself on the ground while it bleated pathetically. I moved down from the catwalk to the floor, where the animal scooted past me before sinking into the floor, still bleating. Charcoal bodies hung suspended in the air like they were held by an invisible string. Some of them were reaching out, grasping for help even in death, and some were curled up, comforting themselves. \n\nTowards the middle of the room, sat four giant batteries, sticking out from the floor. There were four of them, all inscribed with some language I didn’t even recognize. Connected by cords, there was a seat between them all. It resembled an electric chair, with a helmet and restraint straps, but the restraints had clearly been snapped. \n\nI was taking this all in when I heard the woman come into the basement. There was nothing I could do. Whatever had done this, I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t even begin to comprehend it. I took a breath before running to hide. There were pipes everywhere, and I tried to find some that made a corner small. I contorted my body and compressed myself down into a fetal position. Tears streamed down my face, but I was silent. My son would wonder why Mommy didn’t come home. Or maybe she would come home and it would be whatever the fuck just killed Delta. \n\n“Found you,” she whispered. It felt like four hands were scratching me and digging into my skin, tearing through my clothes and ripping chunks out of my body. Then it felt like six hands. Twelve hands. Eight hands. \n\nI was kicking and screaming, too panicked to do anything other than try to protect my face. She was laughing and it sounded like a room full of people laughing. Maybe I started laughing. I don’t know. My eyes were screwed shut and I could tell I was bleeding and I just wanted it to be over.\n\nSomething made her stop. She pulled away from me and I felt a cold little hand on my face. It was filmy, and greasy, but I leaned into the relief the coolness provided and sobbed. \n\nIt pulled away. I heard wet footsteps walk away from me.\n\nAnd then I was standing at the entrance to the power plant. It was the next day. I was covered in blood, and some black substance that reeked like garbage. But I was alive. I collapsed on the ground and radioed for assistance. \n\nI was given a significant amount of cash and a medical retirement. The first thing I did with my newfound wealth was buy a house on the west coast and get the hell out of there. Whatever was in that power plant, whatever force killed all those people, it's still out there, as far as I know. Nobody stopped it that day. The incident at Grouse Springs only ended because *it wanted it to end,* do you understand?\n\n I told my employers that my camera broke- I’m not sure why they believed me, but they did. I kept the cassette. At the time I wasn’t sure why, but now I realize. \n\nI need people to know what happened.\n\n\\-Good Luck\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn the early 1940s, the U.S. State Department, along with the Army, deliberately infected prisoners in Illinois with malaria, in hopes of studying the effects on the human body. In 1943, the U.S. government conducted what is now known as the Philadelphia Experiment, using unified field theory in the effort to make a ship completely undetectable. This ended poorly, and many sailors aboard were left with PTSD as a result, and one man lost his hand. Following this, the U.S. government continued experimenting with magnetic fields in Project Montauk, using the underprivileged as test subjects. In 1950, the U.S. Navy sprayed an allegedly harmless bacteria over San Francisco in an event called Operation Sea-Spray. It turned out the disease caused pneumonia-like symptoms, and many people became ill. Between 1960 and 1971, the Department of Defense paid to irradiate cancer patients to record data on how high levels of radiation affect the human body.\n\nThese are just a handful of examples the United States government has experimented on its own citizens, which were only revealed through the Freedom of Information Act. It is likely that there have been countless more times the United States has subjected civilians to unethical scientific research well into the modern day. I believe that the alleged paraphysical force powering the city of Grouse Springs was one of these times, resulting in one of the most dangerous industrial accidents of all time. Information on Project SKIPJACK needs to be publicly released. The government needs to be held accountable for this tragedy- it is unacceptable to subject an entire town to understudied, highly lethal physical forces, and it is time for this matter held secret in the dark to come into the light. \n\nWe, the citizens of the United States of America, demand honesty. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*As a collector of newspapers, I have a vast collection of articles on missing persons. I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence that a young boy went missing here, in our world, in 2008, in the neighborhood located near the woods in which I found the bodies Cole describes as vanishing. I have been seeing lights, recently, near my home. In my dreams, I see her face, laughing at me. She is saying something, but I cannot understand.*\n\n*Douglas Ray Cleavon’s diligent research and commitment to the truth is commendable. However, in his analysis of the events at Grouse Springs, I believe he made a grave mistake. This could not be dismissed as an industrial accident. The Philadelphia Experiment, project Montauk, the testing on American civilians conducted in the past, these events weren’t about discovering new power sources-*\n\nTHEY WERE ABOUT DEVELOPING A WEAPON.",

        "text": "I somehow always knew I would eventually be adopted. Even as I got older, I found myself free from the crippling concern that plagued the other children in our orphanage—that we were somehow unfairly punished to a sentence in that imposing, lonely mansion tucked away in that clearing in the forest, and doomed to the inevitable uncertainties and struggles of independent life once we reached legal age. Granted, I wasn’t that old when my parents, after an impulsive but decisive choice, adopted me— I was seven and a half—but, for us, once you were past the endearing years of toddlerhood, everything was left to fate. There weren’t many prospective couples seeking to adopt in our area, made worse by an arduous and expensive process to claim a child as ones own. I would later on learn, as a young adult, that I was one of the lucky ones, having found a family when most of my peers would eventually age out of the system before having a life outside of that damned home. \n\nThough images of St. Hilda’s return to me in only hazy fragments as I attempt to recall my childhood, they are vividly clear in my nightmares. Long nights, long corridors, long waits for visiting couples. Worse, still—corporal punishment by nuns cloaked in black, the eery whispers of the wind against rusty window panes, and of course, the shadow in the forest. \n\nBoys and girls were separated into bedrooms of twelve, but because we weren’t many, most rooms in St. Hilda’s remained unoccupied. The orphans - a ragtag group of rebels, bookworms, and outsiders - were strictly put to bed every night at 7:30. Of course, we never listened, and once the sisters returned to their wing of the mansion, we had all the fun we weren’t permitted to have in St. Hilda’s. Ghost stories, stolen snacks, forbidden movies - those nights were our only reprieve from the monsters that cursed us from within that home. Of course, we were completely oblivious to the one that stalked us from outside. Until one day. \n\nAlfie, the youngest of our age group, pointed out unsurely as we ate away at some snickers bars, “There’s a man in the flowerbeds!” Of course, none of us believed him, mostly because the clearing in which St. Hilda’s was located was in an unusually secluded forest, but also because Alfie tended to have an equally unusual imagination. But as we peeked out the long windows of our second floor room, sure enough, there, lurked a shadow in the flowerbed. A swift hush fell over the room. It was a rare occasion for us to receive any visitors, and they certainly never came in the middle of the night. But as soon as the silhouette had appeared, it was suddenly gone. We wrote it off quickly as the shadow of a fox or a deer, and anyways, as children, our naïveté protected us from thoughts of burglars and thieves. \n\nBut the very next day, Lucie, the most timid of the girls, cried all through lunchtime, complaining that she couldn’t sleep with monsters stalking us in the clearing. The sisters swiftly took her away and Lucie never mentioned it again. Of course, with Lucie now having corroborated what we thought we might have seen, we dared not to look out the windows at night. We stopped playing outside during our breaks, and we certainly never went near the flowerbeds. Peter, the leader of the boys, occasionally took quick looks for us at night, and assured us that there was nothing outside. But he was always overprotective of us, and I couldn’t decide whether I believed him or not, so I took a look outside, and he was right. \n\nBut on another night, as he routinely looked out the window to assuage our fears, he stopped mid-sentence, frozen, not in fear, but in confusion. We all ran to his side and took a look for ourselves. On the flowerbeds stood the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She was about our age, but she definitely was not an orphan at St. Hilda’s, because there were only fourteen girls, and I knew each of them like a sister. \n\n“Want to play with me?” she shouted up at us, smile wide and eyes twinkling. \n\nNone of us replied. We didn’t know what to do or say, both awestruck and confused at the same time. Who was she? What was she doing there?\n\n“Maybe she needs our help,” Peter announced to our group as he opened the door to the long corridor. But just as he was about to step into it, he was stopped by the girls whose bedroom was right next to ours. \n\n“I know what you’re going to do, Peter” said Lina, the oldest of the girls. “She’s been looking at our window all night. We don’t know what to do, but don’t you find it a bit weird she’s just… standing there?”\n\n“What if she needs our help?” he replied back, worry aging his young face. \n\n“She’s been there all night. She’s asking us to play. If you wanna do something about it, go tell the sisters, but don’t go out on your own.” \n\nSuddenly, the wind outside stopped, and an eery silence fell over the mansion. \n\n“WHY WON’T YOU PLAY WITH ME! WHY WON’T YOU PLAY WITH ME! COME OUT!” shouted a much deeper voice, shaking the whole house and resonating through our bones. \n\nWe all scrambled to the girls room in fear, not daring to look down the windows, and remained huddled together for the rest of the night. When the sisters found us the next morning, we received a punishment I will choose not to speak of. But when we relayed what had happened the night before, I recognized a hint of uncertainty in Sister Agatha’s voice as she announced that “it was nothing but your imaginations.” Because the very next day, cracks had spread throughout the windows in all our rooms, many of them too high for us to reach in the long windows. \n\nNone of us brought it up the next day, or the day after, or for weeks to come. We were afraid that speaking of the creature outside would somehow help it materialize. And though we all silently knew what each other was thinking of, we dared not bring it up again. \n\nBut curiosity overtook me, and when no one was watching one night night, I stole a quick glance out the window. At the edge of the clearing lurked a shadow, but as I was about to alarm the other boys, a beautiful lady stepped out. Her bright smile was drawn with red lipstick, and a luminescent string of pearls hung around her neck. She wore the most lovely yellow dress, partially hidden by a small apron adorned with polka dots. She was humming— a lull so sweet it made me dream of a home I never had. And though, at that point, I had never truly knew what one was like, she was exactly what I had imagined a mother to look like. \n\n“She’s carrying a cake” cried Alfie, as the other boys joined me, “right on time for my birthday!” \n\nAnd right under arm, she was carrying gifts—of all sizes and colors, as though she had one personally for each of us. As though entranced by her lullaby, every boy ran down the stairs, asking excitedly questions no one had the answers to. Who was she? Where did she come from? What were in those gifts? Who were they for?\n\nAnd as we reached the bottom of the stairs, we watched her continue to walk towards us—stopping, however, abruptly right before the doorsteps. It is difficult for me to relay what happened in the moments next, but I believe it is finally time to tell the story covered up by the sisters of St. Hilda’s. I don’t know why I didn’t follow, but I have never been more grateful for my guts. \n\nThe beautiful lady—almost out of a 1950’s housewives magazine—laid down the cake and gifts, then held her hands out to us, beckoning us forward. The boys, excluding myself, ran out, leaving the premises of St. Hilda’s for the first time in a long time, and ran towards her. But as soon as they had all ran out, the main door slammed shut, trapping them outside. \n\nI will never forget the sounds of their screams, and at night, when I recall these memories, I try not to imagine what caused them. But I know. \n\nI can not recall the moments after, or how long I had just stood there or when I finally run to the sisters, but the echoes of their cries will remain with me forever. After that night, I became the only boy left in St. Hilda’s, and the mysterious disappearances of Peter, Alfie, and the rest was quickly covered up by both what I assume to be a great effort by the sisters of St. Hilda’s and the authorities’ disregard for a run-down orphanage. To this day, media coverage of the incident remains minimal, and the guilt that eats at me has been suppressed by attempts to repress my unhappy childhood. \n\nSo, if one day, you find shadows in your flowerbeds, the best advice I can part with you is to not go outside at night.",

        "text": "Please forgive me for how this is written.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've stayed awake as long as I can, my eyes are so heavy. I'm just...so...so...tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry mom. I should have listened to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom used to tell me about the thin places in this world. The places where the veil between here and *there* can slip, and show us flashes of what's beyond. Or sometimes, *things* can sneak through. I guess her grasp on *here,* wherever \"here\" is, got a bit too thin, because Dad committed her to psychiatric care when I was eight. I never blamed him. When she started scratching out photos of herself, covering mirrors and turning her eyes away from her shadow, it was pretty clear that she needed help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it was help that she never got. She died a week later. \"Natural causes\" was on the death certificate, but now I'm sure there was nothing natural about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't believe I got all the way to 21 before I thought any more about the thin places. Mom's warnings and stories had faded into hazy memories. I was attempting to furnish my apartment about a month ago, trying to stretch my budget to make it feel a little more like a home. I'd found the perfect piece to add some luxury - an enormous antique mirror. It was a little cloudy, but the swirling details in a dull coppery metal around the rim added a sense of old world glamour to my apartment that I couldn't normally afford. Mom would have hated it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hung it right next to my bed, wanting it to be somewhere I'd see it often. At first, it brought me so much joy. Until I heard the scratching. It didn't strike me as odd, at first. I live in an old apartment, and mice in the walls wouldn't be a huge surprise. But the traps I set didn't seem to help. The scratching just got worse and worse, until I was finding it hard to sleep. That's when some of mom's old stories started to trickle back into my mind. \"Be careful what memories of the world you bring into your life, old things can carry echoes of lives they once lived\". Ridiculous? Right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the scratching wouldn't stop and I couldn't get mom's warning out of my head. Most nights I'd end up staring aimlessly at the ceiling, praying for sleep to take me. Until one night, right as I was about to drift off - teetering between asleep and awake, something caught my eye and I was yanked back awake. I could have sworn I saw a shadow of movement in the mirror. Naturally, I did what any sane person would do - moved the mirror to the floor in the hallway until I could get rid of it and threw an old sheet over the top. At last, the scratching stopped. I can't tell you the relief of falling soundly asleep that night. But it wasn't over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next night, I saw *her*. Saw *me*. I woke in the darkness to hear the sheet slithering off the mirror and looked over. My reflection stood there, perfectly still, watching me. It wasn't possible, I was laying in bed bleary eyed, yet there *she* stood in the moonlit mirror, staring. I thought I was going to throw up from fear. I lay frozen and stared back. Eventually, I worked up the courage to launch a pillow at my bedroom door, slamming it shut, and waited petrified for morning light. As soon as the sun was up, it  felt like a bad dream - like it wasn't real. I took the mirror to the dump straight away, but I think in my heart I knew it was too late. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that the mirror's gone, I see *her* everywhere. My shadow takes a moment too long to follow, my photos follow me with their eyes. *My* eyes. I know *she's* there, watching and waiting. \n\nWaiting for what? I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should have listened mom, I'm sorry. I got too close to the thin place, and now I can't get out. I can feel that *she's* waiting for me to sleep, to slip between the world's of waking and slumber where the veil is thin. It's been a few days now, and each time my head begins to nod and my eyes droop, I see the shadows start to creep from the walls and slither towards me and know *she's* close. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't do it anymore, I don't know how to escape myself. I'm sorry mom, but I have to sleep,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She's* coming.",

I was inside a room and the heat was already causing me to sweat, my breathing was laboured from fear but I knew I had to use the door again to get away from the creature. As I went to put the key in the lock the door started opening meaning that thing was already coming through so I had to run. The other side of the room had another door but no keyhole so I ran through it and happened upon what looked to be a huge abandoned warehouse.\n\nI took a quick glance around but saw no doors, what I did notice though was a huge opening on the other side of the building. This led outside but I noticed a strong red tinge to the landscape but tried not to think about it yet as I knew I had to get away from that creature. I managed to run outside when the heat intensified so much that I found it hard to breath, it was then that I noticed the red colour I was seeing was because there were fires everywhere.\n\nBuildings, trees and even bodies I noticed were burning, the sight and smell almost caused me to pass out but my adrenaline kept me going. I walked for hours trying to find a door I could use to get out of this dimension but saw nothing as every possible place I could find a door was already burnt or still burning and to dangerous to enter. The only thing I could do was keep searching, it was after another few hours I finally saw some people in the distance and started making my way towards them. When I was in sight of them the only thing I could manage to say before passing out was “water!”\n\nI’m not sure how long I was out but when I awoke I came to find myself tied to a chair surrounded by these people in all black robes. I tried to understand what was happing and looked at one of them and asked what is happening and why am I tied up. The person I was looking at stepped closer to me and whispered “Child of god, what is it you believe?” I didn’t understand the question so repeated what I asked first but this time trying to sound a little more authoritative, which just came out shakily. The person then looked me directly in the eye and shouted “we the sons of lucifer demand your faith, you will no longer be a child of god. We are as one and will bring about the rise of our father once more!”\n\nI’ve never been religious and tried my best to sound sincere when I told them I would do whatever it is they asked but they just laughed and we’re all shouting “blasphemer!” They kept repeating this over and over for hours and hours all whilst the one who first started asking me questions was muttering under his breath in a different language, I believe it was Latin but honestly am not 100% sure as I only speak English. Whilst this was happing I was actively trying to get free not caring that they were staring at me I just knew that I had to get away. I ended up exerting so much energy I passed out again.\n\nSuddenly a huge crashing sound woke me up and I noticed the people were no longer Round me, in fact I couldn’t see them anywhere. I heard another huge ceasing sound but this time closer and another and another, each time it was come closer and making the floor shake. My mind was racing but I knew I had to get out and now so I started really pulling at the restraints trying to either break them or hoping they would loosen enough. The crashing sound stopped and I looked to my left and what I saw chilled me to my very soul, there standing as large as a house was a monster at least that’s the only explanation I could come up with for what I was seeing.\n\nIt was dark and humanoid with huge claws even bigger teeth but it’s eyes are what caused me to unashamedly admit I pissed myself in terror. The eyes were black and infinite like I was staring into nothing yet seeing everything. I couldn’t take my eyes off it and knew that this was the end so i stopped struggling and began pleading with this beast to let me go, I tried everything I could think of to convince it to just let me go when it raised its hand and with a swipe created 3 huge cuts on my abdomen. I screamed in agony as my blood started flowing onto my legs and down to the floor, the creature raised its hand again and I knew I wouldn’t survive another swing so bowed my head closed my eyes and succumbed to the inevitable.\n\nNothing happened so I open my eyes and to my horror I was back in the very room that creature took me to question me, I was still tied up but in utter defect as I panned my head across the room there it was the weird static faced suit wearing thing. I just started crying I think mainly due to the fact that I was just utterly and totally exhausted and knew that my fight had all but dissipated. My chest and stomach still hurting from the 3 larges gashes I just said to the creature “kill me, I’m done running and I don’t know fuck all about this key or where it came from so just FUCKING kill me!” This creature just stood there and looked at me or at least I think it was looking at me with its static face.\n\n“You are telling the truth aren’t you?” The creature said, “yes, I’m just done and want out of this nightmare so kill me and get it over with.” I didn’t even have the energy to shout this time and just waited for it to kill me, I waited for what felt like forever and at one point thought it would kill me by letting me bleed out from my wounds. It was after about 10 minutes of me just sitting there in anticipation that the creature said “what would you do to get out of this alive?” I turned my head to it in disbelief and obviously said “I would do anything to get out of this, I want to live I just thought that you wanted to kill me as that’s what you said last time” the creature pulled out a tool and held it near my wounds and with the press of a button my cuts closed and didn’t even leave a scar.\n\nIt then untied me and said “I want to show you something that will change your life forever and I will give you a choice and depending on what path you choose will decide the fate of so many universes” it opened a door that appeared on the wall and beckoned me to follow it. I got up and with nothing left to lose decided why not, as I followed beside it I asked “what are you, where do you come from, where is this…?”\n\n“I promise I will answer your questions very soon but I need you to follow me first” it interrupted. We came to a set of double door which it opened and on the other side were rows upon rows of cages. I couldn’t even guess the number if I tried it looked like it went in forever. I noticed each and ever cage had a person in it dressed in a jumpsuit and metal mask.\n\nThe creature suddenly said “you want to know what I am and what it is I want, well to answer your first question let me show you” it started pulling up on the static which was a mask this whole time and as it came off all I could muster up was “what the fuck” you see it was me I was staring at another me, I tried to compose myself and before I could say anything the other me said “as for what I want is well simple, I want you. I want every single version of us. The cages are filled with us from different dimensions and I want every last one” I stated in disbelief and simply asked “why?” Before the other me had chance to answer I remember he said he was going to give me a choice so I question him on what this choice was.\n\n“That is also simple. You see you will become a member of my collection but your choice is either you become a member today and you will be mine till the end of time or you help me gather other versions of us meaning you get to experience the closest you will get to freedom ever again” I felt a lump in my throat but knew the only thing I could choose was to help him so I said I will help to which he looked at me and smiled. “Let’s get started then, you will continue to use your key to travel and track down the other us’es and once located you will use this (he handed me a device with a button) to signal me and I will come and get the other one of us” I wanted to throw up but knew I had to do what he said. “One last thing. As you have already worked out I can track you anywhere and everywhere so do t run otherwise I will drop you off in a dimension that makes the last one look like heaven”\n\nHe showed me a door and said “now go and make us proud” I stepped through the door and ended up on your earth this is where I am currently, I have to do what he says but each earth I visit I will post this story on some form of website and tell you this. There is someone out there beyond your universe but with the ability to travel here whenever he wants you need to prepare yourself as I have a feeling if he is even the slightest bit like me then he is collecting every version of us for a reason and that reason I believe is to eradicate all lives but us. I’ve located the me from your universe so I need to press the button meaning I won’t be able to post anymore but please I beg of you to get ready and fight as every last one of you will die at our hands trust me.",

        "text": "Jasmine's husband had recently recovered from an illness that had left him bedridden for some time, so he’d gone back to work the day following his recuperation. Left with nothing to do – since she’d spent the entirety of his sickness by his side, playing cooperative video games and caring for him – she asked if I’d like to do something. I happily welcomed the invitation and suggested we go hiking, since I’d bought new boots and wanted to properly break them in. \n\nWe set out that morning, choosing for our trip a densely packed expanse of woods at the edge of town, though not far from their home. I figured it would prove to be a moderately challenging trek, given our shared inexperience with traversing terrain that hadn’t been carefully cultivated to suit suburban-dwelling citizens. Had I known just how challenging – how starkly terrifying – the trip would be, I would’ve stayed home….or burnt down the whole stretch of vegetation. \n\nA few minutes into the hike I heard a sound from somewhere to my right, off the barely defined path we'd been following. The noise had sounded almost human, like a call from someone deep within a cave; distant and low, a subterranean echo carried through tunnel after murky tunnel.\n\nWithout announcing my departure – the thought never even occurred to me – I veered off, trudging through thicket and bush, while Jasmine continued on, oblivious.\n\nFinally, I reached the spot from where the sound had seemed to originate, though there was only a small knoll, or massive boulder overgrown with dark leafage and moss. Strangely, I felt drawn to this seemingly natural object, as if it, somehow, was the source of the still-sounding call.\n\nJust then a breeze blew through the trees, momentarily clearing the umbrage of their boughs, allowing for a small ray of sunlight to shine upon the structure. As if somehow disturbed by the light, the rounded surface shifted, and a few of the curiously dark leaves fell away. I realized then that the structure was neither an elevation in the earth nor a boulder that had come to settle there, but something else entirely. It wasn’t a structure at all – it was a massive, vaguely anthropomorphic skull. \n\nTime-yellowed bone glimmered faintly in the sunlight, at least where it was not armored in moss. Eye sockets, vast and vacant, seemed to reject the sun’s illumination; twin portals of blackness that admitted no light into their depths. Most of the face was over-mossed and lichen, though I knew without a doubt that the visage hadn’t belonged to any race or remote cousin of Man. The physiognomy was too unwholesome, too suggestive of a bestial – if not monstrous - strain of life. The Thing was hideous right down to the bone. \n\nHalf of its jaw was buried in the earth, and nature had long ago staked its claim on the unguessably ancient relic. But it hadn’t done so without a certain degree of…corruption. The soil beneath the gargantuan skull was oddly colored, black in certain areas, a sickly green in others. The immediate atmosphere around the skull was inexplicably temperamental. Suitably chilly – given the time of year – one moment, and uncomfortably warm the next. But before I could even begin to guess at how such things could be, I heard my name called once more. \n\nThe call – the pull – was magnetic, as if I were being summoned by some higher being whose voice had come from a place far-flung in space, if not wholly extra-dimensional. It tugged at my skeleton, seeking to move the mechanisms of my body even as it sought to bend my mind to its will. I tried to fight it, felt the terror of the moment surge within me like hot bile. And yet the next moment I was walking -  quite casually – over to the abominable idol. \n\nUnable to even tremble in fear, I stopped just a few inches from the half-buried mouth, helplessly awaiting the next segment in this nightmarish episode. Though it had no eyes, I nonetheless felt as if I were being scrutinized by some inkling of intelligence, evaluated by an incredibly resilient remnant of a once great mind. \n\nThe stench hit me before the miasmal exhalation even appeared. The rancid funk was unlike anything I’d ever smelled before, and when it finally surged from that partially toothed grin, it almost knocked me back despite my immobility.. More potent in its putridity than a burning septic tank, the oral expulsion blasted away my thoughts even as it blew back the tiny hairs within my nostrils. Unable to control my legs, still anchored to the spot by that dead thing’s influence, I could only suffer the mind-unhinging foulness. \n\nUntil my suffering turned to elation.\n\nAs if a switch had been flicked in my brain, the stench suddenly ceased to be so, and from then became a more than agreeable scent. I couldn't have said what olfactory notes it carried in the moment; but looking back, I’m sure that the newly perceived smell was whisky, bourbon; something I hadn’t had for a while. \n\nI was no longer repulsed by the clouding vapor, and my fear of the undead skull had all but diminished. In its place was quickly arising a sense of awe, of dim-witted wonderment. Some vestigial sub-section of my mind knew that its neighboring parts were being tricked, that this ungodly relic of a corpse had all but commandeered my brain. But I was already transfixed, had in mere seconds succumbed to its outward necromancy. \n\nInhaling the noxious intoxicant, I found myself relishing the respiratory failure; I prostrated myself before the inimical spray, catching the fat, sallow droplets in my mouth, upon my tongue, as if they were snowflakes - malignant little treats.  The vapor stained my face, soaked my hair, seared my skin... and yet I welcomed the acrid erosion of my flesh, as a mountain's vegetation can do nothing but welcome the molten discharge of its volcanic core.\n\nWhen most of my nose was gone and my cheeks had all but sloughed away, I opened my eyes to receive the blinding anointing of my ghoulish, gaseous God, and be forever plunged into sightless sublimity.\n\nBut before my sight could be taken from me, there was a sudden tug on my collar, and I was pulled from the fulsome cloud.\n\n* I was dropped almost two meters from the still-sighing ghoul. Above me, my friend's face appeared, blotting out the sun. Her eyes were wide, and she was screaming something; but I could only hear that cadaverous voice beckoning, pleading for me to return. My God was crying for me to rejoin him.  Rot with me. \n\nA wave of black grief washed over me, with anger riding atop the onrushing tide. I thrashed on the ground, flinging wild blows at Jasmine. She stepped away, her face taut with horror. The God roared in my head. Before I could think to rise - or at least reorient myself and crawl - Jasmine picked up a large stone from the ground, marched over to the half-sentient corpse, and hurled the missile through the miasma. \n\nIt struck the eldritch Thing in its forehead, caving in its already fractured brow. I more than heard the subsequent roar of pain, I felt it. It pulsed through my bones. Sent quakes through the lobes of my brain. I'd been linked with that abhorrent mind through my ingestion of its corpse fumes, and its second death nearly brought on my first. \n\nAfter a few moments of undead agony, the whole thing collapsed upon itself. Bone dust and ashen motes of brain matter burst skyward, the charnel plumes dwarfing the nearby trees.\n\nJasmine returned to me and, not waiting for me to protest or fight back, hefted me over her shoulder. She carried me out of the woods, meanwhile I sobbed for the unceremonious end of my Lord, who had stoically persisted through untold cycles before our arrival. \n\nBut when we'd gone far enough away, my sorrow suddenly ceased, and I felt only a lingering sense of filthiness, of having been violated. A phantom malignancy seemed to remain within my body, even as some insidious element of cancer might linger during remission – mustering itself in feigned defeat, only to spring forth anew, later. \n\nJasmine let me fall from her shoulder as if I were a sack of laundry. We were in an open field, sunlit and freshly mowed. Despite the warmth of the day, I shivered, as one might shiver after emerging from a cryostatic slumber. I'd been under the spell of a forgotten horror, and had - in just a short time - grown accustomed to a state of chilly thralldom.\n\nShe told me to get up, her voice carrying tones of both terror and authority. I knew that she'd strike me down if I so much as stumbled toward her. Carefully, I rose to my feet and brushed myself off. I felt shaky, sick, replete with a kind of nausea I’d never experienced before. \n\nI told her that I was fine, at least compared to before. Understandably, she did not immediately believe me. I tried to assure her that the horror’s influence was gone, that we’d traveled far enough away from it. Risking a punch to the face, I took a slow step toward her. She cringed and backed away, and I then remembered that I’d had most of my face burned away.\n\n As if triggered by the remembrance, the agony of my wounds immediately arose, sending me to my knees. I shrieked madly, and Jasmine’s trepidation at my allegiance swiftly shot away. She rushed to me and wrapped her arms around my waist, and I was again thrown over her shoulder. (Thank the true Lord for our town’s gym). As I lost what little I’d regained of my sanity, Jasmine carried me back to her house. \n\nFrom there, she drove me to the hospital. My wounds were treated, the reason for them given as accidental exposure to a burst pipe on her property. Even as I drifted in and out of consciousness, I insisted that the issue was already being taken care of, and that they needn't send any city officials to investigate the dubious rupture. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm still in the hospital, masked in bandages and more than sufficiently doped up on meds. Jasmine is here with me, staying by my side as I heal. Though lately – as of the last few hours – she’s been staring out the window; vacantly, or with such utter focus that it appears that way. Occasionally, she'll cock her head to the side, as if hearing something from far off. \n\nI'm just now realizing that the window of my room faces the woods across town. But they're so far away. Even if it was alive, surely it couldn't be calling to us, to ….not from so far away….",

        "text": "I am writing this minutes after attempting suicide. Despite my hypoxia-addled mind, I believe that the events which have just transpired need to be detailed and shared with the masses. The world needs to know what I have just seen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went about it as I usually do. I committed a strangled genuflect– acting as my own personal papist and executioner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat’s when, through the ink-like darkness pooling into and obscuring my vision, I saw It. It reminded me of the hallucinations I saw when I tried killing myself with Robitussin. Like a biblically accurate angel if it was made out of kaleidoscopes (and if those kaleidoscopes were made out of stained glass portraits of a lion’s maw). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat’s not the scary part though. Crowded around it were overlapping apparitions writhing and sobbing on the ground. It was upon squinting that I realized these ghosts were familiar. My world began to spin as I came to understand that these ghosts were me, all of them in varying states of misery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd It was devouring them, carnivorous teeth spinning like windmills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so startled by this that I remained kneeling in frozen terror– poised like the executioner’s next kill– only capable of watching and witnessing the horror of the events transpiring in front of me. Hot tears dripped down the burst capillaries in my cheeks and soundlessly hit the ground. It felt like my entire life had been leading up to this one horrifying moment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA memory came to the forefront of my mind, of playing video games with my younger brother– one of the only times I can recall feeling no anxiety or despair. It was due to this recollection that I could no longer hold back the choking sobs inside my throat, and it was because of my tearful coughs that It, the specter, finally noticed me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt opened Its many mouths, and with a voice that smelled like petrichor and weather vanes it warbled, “Have You Decided To Stay?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEars burning, I wordlessly nodded my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Do You Promise?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” I said dumbly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Do You Promise To Stay?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at my gored corpses scattered across the floor like shattered Christmas ornaments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That’s The Vestiges Of Your Misery.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my mind’s eye, I remembered myself coming home from school on a rainy day, tracking mud into my house because I forgot to wipe my boots off on the mat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I Am Sustained By The Misery Of Your Species.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remembered a Wikipedia article I had read about the Hypostomus plecostomus, also known as suckermouth catfish. Highly demanded as bottom cleaners in the Aquarium Trade. It is named for its sucker-like mouth and feeds on algae, aquatic-plants, and small crustaceans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I Want You To Know That I Am Grateful For The Feasts You Have Granted Me In Your Life. Out Of Everyone I Have Attached Myself To, You Have Managed To Live The Longest, Even In The Wake Of Such Bountiful Despair.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think my terror hit a plateau at some point during this, and somehow this gave me enough confidence to cough out, “...what? Are you killing me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Its’ kaleidoscope maws, there erupted a sound like a thousand hummingbirds' wing beats. I assume this was as close a proximation as It could come to a laugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Would You Destroy Your Favorite Restaurant? It Is In My Best Interest To Eat, So It Is In My Best Interest To Keep You Alive. I Attached Myself To You Not Parasitically But Mutualistically. Creatures Like Myself, Misery Feeders, Have Subsumed Your Race Much Like How Plant Cells Absorbed And Became One With Photosynthetic Prokaryotes. You Have Evolved To Have A Capacity For Misery Beyond That Of Any Other Species On This Earth, And My Species Has Evolved To Subsist Off Of That Misery Solely.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Like coral and algae.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Exactly. How, I Ask You, Would Such Miserable Creatures As Yourselves Be Able To Persevere If There Were Not Some Outside Force Keeping You Alive?  How You Long For Self-destruction, How You Yearn To Vanish Yourselves.  Even Now, My People Are The Sole Force Standing Between Billions Of Lives Lost To Suicide. Every Week We Narrowly Stop A Government Official From Annihilating A Neighboring Country. \n\nEvery Month We Meet Here In This Room–\n\nAnd I Stand Between You And Death Every Time.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing this I began to feel like my blood had been carbonated. I passed out, but before completely losing consciousness, I thought I could feel a hand stroking my cheek. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat brings me to the end of my recollection. I think it is critical that we acknowledge these deities, and that we attempt to understand them before we are forced to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think really all I want is for other people to know what I do. So I’m not alone with this knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven now I think I can feel It feeding off my current despair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m sure if you try, you can feel it too.",

        "text": "A mine outside of Williamsville, Illinois. Known once as the Valentine Mine, now as the Viper Mine. The old Valentine Mine was very successful for many-a-year, but one “small” (as the company laid with corruption, through and through said) incident did the the company known as Jackson and Allison Mining Co. in. 14 miners and 1 police officer murdered brutally. The killer never found the investigation, long left cold. 1951 was the year - the mine in question had just opened for business. And the migration of people from Chicago had picked up whom ever was looking for a much more country life. The pay was great for the time, ‘twas a $1.00. The pay was good for a reason though…considering the mines were very dangerous and also there were some very trying requirements to be chosen.\n\n72 men were chosen to work there on the opening shift. Strong willed and physically tough men. All gathered at the soon to be entrance. It took little over 7 days to get down into coal levels. Eventually they got down deep enough, built the scaffolding and other mining necessities. So for about 5 or 6 weeks everything was running smooth. During the day they would work like a dog, get lunch break and regular break up on the surface considering the black lung isn’t too fun to obtain. Around week 7 things began feeling off… the energy and synergy between everyone was tense. There wasn’t as many jokes as there once was, frankly… there were just low suspicious whispers being spread about one another. It’s almost as the deep, dark mines and coal dust was slowly driving the long-worked men whom are hardened by many years for that matter, insane. There was another energy in the pit. A darkness not in the physical sense, no. But, but in the…the spiritual sense. Something that was just nagging at the sanity of the good men from the dark. Voices from the darkness flooded individuals minds with thoughts of murder and/or being murdered. Fear, suspicion and just utter suspense flooded the whole entire area. Those daily 12 hour shifts damn sure didn’t help…\n\nWithin the first year they had over 120 miners on the roster. Now, some of those from the original crew had long left. They, claimed that the mines held an influence that collided with any god-fearing man. As one quoted:\n\n“If you don’t fear or know the Lord above, God help you if you go down into that mine. You best have a lick of discipline…or you’ll either be murdered or the…the…th- murderer.” -Anonymous Miner, (just a specification for those curious).\n\n1952: Not a soul knew this would be this great mines last year. Nor would they know that this was the end of the owners of that mine. The events that happened were far too much for anyone, anywhere to handle. So, somewhere in the 9 o’clock hour of the morning. The sound of pickaxes and heavy machinery rang out. When the sound of a blood curdling scream rang out. Some men were afraid others were annoyed believing it to be a certain college that has done this at the random before. Although, after a minute they begin to realize that it might not be him because there was not an echo of his laughter from any corridors or anywhere. So the suspicion quickly grew into worry. 3 fellas stopped working and started searching for whom made that scream. Eventually they came upon a sight that soured all of the 3 guys stomachs. There on the ground lay the corpse of one of the newer workers. Head split open with a pickaxe…still hanging on to his skull. His helmet did almost nothing to block the impact. Who ever did it used a whole hell of a lot of force to burst through it. The 3 men who found the body immediately ran to their boss alerting him of the death. As they broke the news to him he immediately ordered all of the miners out of the cave since it was very dangerous for them to be in there as whatever cold blooded bastard did it is still out there.\n\nThe police were called on scene and scoured the entire site with the aid of one of the more experienced workers whom knew the mine inside and out. No-one was ever convicted. The mine stayed closed for the weeks the investigation went on and was eventually opened, with police and security now monitoring the site. After no deaths came up for about a month the police eventually left it in the hands of the hired security sanctioned by the company. Another week passed without incident, until… another 3 miners were discovered with their throats slit with what looked to have been a saw…considering the cuts were not clean and were more rough than anything. It also so happened that it was the 3 fellas who discovered the last dead body… it looked to be an almost revengeful murder.\n\nAgain all miners were ordered out for their own safety. All but 10 showed up… police searched in the mines and found many more gruesome murders. Such as one miner having his entrails ripped out of him by a pickaxe…another having his heart cut out with a sharp stone. The others well they were so gruesome that…that the police wouldn’t release what happened to them. Many of the other miners were under heavy investigation looking for clues. Such as, if they had anything against the other miners or whatever. Nothing was found. The police stayed out this time to see if they could find the culprit and hopefully catch him before anyone else was taken out.\n\nThe feeling of spiritual darkness creeped ever again, stronger this time. The feeling of some malevolent presence grew stronger than ever before. Many miners began to quit under the pressure of the ongoing murders and also that god-damned feeling that always creeped in the back of their necks.\n\nOne cold December night, the police began to scour the mines making sure everyone was okay. Two officers were present in the mine that day as opposed to the five that were normally there. The rest that could perhaps come from the department were caught up in a massive incident happening within the city that required a lot of help. Anyway, as one the officers rounded a corner leading to a long dusty corridor. A loud gunshot were heard off in the distance. The officer ran to go see what in gods heavenly earth had just happened. Praying it wasn’t what he thought it was. As he made his way into the bend that led to one of the main strips he saw what he hoped he wouldn’t see… there laid on the floor was his partner. Gunshot wound to the back of the head. He began to search for who did it gun drawn and eyes and ears wide open. He never found who did it. \n\nMatters are made worse knowing it was his gun that did it. Because a week prior he sat his old revolver down at one of the desks in the office of the mine to go use the can and when he came back it had vanished. They never found it…but he did. It was right there by the body of his fallen comrade.\n\nA month later the mine closed down and the company went bankrupt because of all of the fees and fines they had to pay. No one knows who did it…but one thing is certain…that mine held an energy that no man has ever known. Perhaps it wasn’t one man who killed all of those men. Maybe the darkness got to more than one man after-all.",

        "text": "**Solution for tension and anxiety**\n\n1.\tI have not made any serious plan to create this world. I created this world just as a play only. I am not touched by any fruit of any soul. I didn’t spend any energy for this creation since I am beyond the worldly logic.\n\n2.\tI have created this world, which can’t even touch Me since it is totally unreal and I am totally real as per My absolute plane. From Me, the soul shall learn that it must also do any work without attaching itself to the work or to its fruit, in which case, such soul is also not touched by any work or fruit. The anxiety possessed by the soul in doing the work for getting the fruit makes the soul very weak and tortures the soul with high stress and tension.\n\n3.\tThe soul is spending lot of energy in serious thinking before doing a work. The soul is also tortured very much by the attachment to fruit. If the soul does work without attaching itself to the fruit, the energy required for the work is very little and the soul will not become weak after the work. The energy supplied to a system is partly spent for the work and partly spent for the tension due to attachment to fruit. Lot of energy is spent in the excitement by the excessive attachment to the fruit and sometimes, no energy is available for the work. In such case, the work fails.\n\n4.\tSattvam means the essence of inert energy that is transformed into awareness. Expenditure of awareness in the process of anxiety and tension through attachment to the fruit is the highest loss since awareness is very precious energy than inert energy and inert matter. The soul must learn to do every work without anxiety and tension by detaching itself to the fruit. The soul shall stay always in the balanced state treating both gain and loss of fruit to be equal. The souls shall do the work thinking that the fruit belongs to somebody else and not to itself, in which case, the soul is not disturbed by any tension. Selfishness is the main reason of all tensions. If the soul develops selflessness, even while doing selfish works, the soul remains undisturbed.\n\n5.\tThe Veda says that the soul develops fear by which tension is created due to selfishness that draws limited boundaries of self and its family (Atha tasya bhayam bhavati ya etadudaramantaram kurute). Some people think that self is God for whom this entire world stands as family. For the sake of good spiritual progress, the concept of monism can be exploited about which God will never mind and in fact, gets pleased also. God becomes furious only when monism is exploited to do sins.\n\n6.\tThe physical works need little energy only. The effect of physical work is very much beneficial for the health. The mental work needs lot of energy. If the mental work is in the form of tension, very enormous amount of energy is spent. The soul need not worry about physical and mental work if tension is absent. Desire is the root source of attachment to fruit, which leads the soul to commit sins. Hence, God Buddha advised us to eradicate selfish desire, which is the root cause of all sins and subsequent miseries.\n\n7.\tYoga means several concepts. The first main concept is association with Satguru or human incarnation. Yoga comes from the root verb ‘yuj’, which means meeting. It also means the preservation of energy without wasting it so that the soul becomes highly energetic, which is the needed basis for all the three steps (knowledge, devotion and service with sacrifice).\n\n8.\tI am doing very huge works like creation, ruling and destruction of the world with full detachment and without any selfishness. I have infinite treasure of energy with Me just because I am detached from everything and selfless always. If this clue is followed, the soul becomes very efficient in doing responsibilities and also in doing spiritual efforts.\n\n9.\tYoga means association of the self with balanced state (Sthitaprajna) in which, there is no attachment to fruit so that its gain doesn’t make the soul to be excited or its loss doesn’t make the soul to get depressed. Maintaining this balanced state with continuous association with it is called as Yoga as said in the Gita (Samatvam yoga uchyate).\n\n10.\tIf this Yoga is used to succeed in worldly works to gain the fruits, which are enjoyed with selfishness only later on, in course of time, such yoga disappears because the selfishness still remains with the soul. Hence, the sacrifice of fruit to some extent at least in the beginning resists the soul from more attachment to selfishness. Even though attachment to fruit shall be destroyed for doing the work more effectively, if the fruit is not sacrificed at all, such Yoga will be destroyed soon. As the sacrifice of fruit increases, the selfishness decreases so that yoga is protected from total destruction.\n\n11.\tEven Patanjali, the founder of Yoga says that preservation of energy by controlling the mind from the desire to fruits and thereby avoiding tension is the Yoga. Sacrifice of work and fruit of work without selfishness makes the Yoga to become more and more powerful day-by-day. That yoga is exploited for the success of work and attaining the fruit. Without sacrifice of fruit, the selfishness gets more and more strong to destroy the yoga.\n\n12.\tHowever much, water may be pumped into the water tank, if the pipe line connected to the tank is leaking water through several holes, there is no use of pumping the water into tank. Similarly, if You don’t resist tensions, which are the leakage holes, there is no use of yoga, which is storage of energy and increase of pumping the energy into tank like soul. Unless You are energetic, You can neither win in this world nor can become fruitful in spiritual efforts.\n\n13.\tA person following the path of yoga doesn’t lose energy even on becoming emotional since the detachment exists in basic level. An ordinary human being looses lot of energy by becoming emotional since basically the attachment exists. The emotion spends very little energy due to basic detachment. The same emotion spends lot of energy due to the basic attachment. If You follow Yoga, You will succeed to attain the fruit and if You come back to the selfishness again in the enjoyment of fruit without any practical sacrifice, such yoga will disappear forever.\n\n14.\tIf You earn the fruit and save it, You have a chance of becoming fruitful in future since there is a possibility of sacrifice of the fruit in the future at least. If You waste the energy in unnecessary works, such chance in the future doesn’t exist in Your case. Don’t waste energy in any unnecessary activity, which is another form of heavenly dancer to spoil Your penance for God.\n\n15.\tIf the discussions are about Me, it is spiritual effort. Similarly, seeing the devotional cinemas. Similarly, reading devotional books. The direction is important and not the material of the path. Same lock and same key, but, if the key is in one direction the lock gets unlocked. If the key is in opposite direction, unlocked lock gets locked. Even if one is interested in discussions, cinemas and novels related to worldly issues, You can get the spiritual benefit if You are concentrating on the victory of justice and thereby victory of God, in which is no wastage of time and energy. You can convert a robber into Your watchman, if You can change the direction of his mentality!\n\n16.\tDetachment means detachment from work and its fruit and this is My state (Na Me Paarthaastikartavyam, Na maam karmaani..., Na Me karmaphale...). Detachment from fruit is proved by its sacrifice and not by selfish enjoyment, which is selfishness. People become selfless by getting detachment from fruit till the fruit is attained. Now, the attachment to fruit comes resulting in self-enjoyment of the fruit without sacrifice. Such detachment up to attainment of fruit and again attachment to fruit for selfish enjoyment is the exploitation of concept done for the success of work in attaining the fruit! This fails because once You are attached to fruit, in the next work, the attachment to fruit appears disturbing You with tension. Hence, You must put effort in sacrificing the excess fruit at least. By this, sin is also avoided, which always appears in earning excess fruit only.\n\n17.\tArjuna was always with tension throughout the war whereas Krishna was with smile throughout the war. You may say that the war is connected to Arjuna and not to Krishna since Arjuna is fighting for his property. This is not correct because even the army of Krishna involved in the war is destroyed. If You take the internal war of all the relatives of Krishna killing each other, in such case also, Krishna remained with smile even though His relatives and even His issues were killed!\n\n18.\tYoga means resisting the expenditure of energy to preserve it. This does not mean that the expenditure should be totally restricted. Money and energy shall be spent only in proper way and not in unnecessary ways. Greedy person stores money even without spending for necessary purpose and the stored money is finally stolen by thieves. Similarly, the stored energy without expenditure for proper purpose is stolen by death in the end. Proper purpose means the essential worldly responsibilities and spiritual activities.\n\n19.\tIf You are unable to resist the unnecessary ways, try to find Me in those unnecessary ways so that it becomes the spiritual activity. The direction towards Me makes such unnecessary activity also as useful spiritual activity. For example, if You are seeing a social picture, feel that while the hero in that picture is trying to oppose injustice and to support justice, he becomes successful due to My grace and My power only. In every scene, whenever injustice is defeated remember that it happened due to My will only. By doing so, You are turning the social picture into devotional picture by changing the direction everywhere towards Me.\n\n20.\tIf the soul is enjoying the social picture for just entertainment only, it has wasted its valuable time and energy. Such soul will go into the cycle of births of birds and animals, which simply enjoy the creation without thinking about Me at least in such enjoyment. The soul got that in which it is interested and hence, such cycles of births are not punishments since whatever is desired by the soul, it is given by its divine Father, who will never act in the line of revenge towards His issues.\n\n21.\tOne can worship Me at any time in any place through any method. His interest and love in Me are the most important factors, which alone attract Me towards him/ her. A person, who has no real love on Me, is particular of time, place and method. This is covering the lack of love of the soul on God and deceiving itself. Such person likes to save energy and time for worldly issues using this pretext! Yoga is for every soul irrespective of caste, gender and religion. Gayatri means praying the Lord through songs and not reciting a Vedic hymn, which is in a meter called as Gayatri.\n\n22.\tGod Shiva is having white Ganga river on the head, which means that one should have the white pure spiritual knowledge in the head. This Ganga river comes out from the foot of God Vishnu, which means that one should be filled with spiritual knowledge from top head to bottom feet indicating assimilation of knowledge becoming blood throughout the body. Some fools treat Shiva as low for keeping Ganga river born from the foot of great Vishnu on His head! They forget that such interpretation is impossible since the Veda says that Shiva and Vishnu are one and the same (Shivashcha Naaraayanah) and hence, the first interpretation is correct.\n\n23.\tThe inhaled (Puuraka) air rich in oxygen is retained (kumbhaka) for some time inside the body so that the purification of blood takes place fully by using all the available oxygen in one inhalation. Expelling the inhaled air (rechaka) is equally important because the air containing impure gases must be also expelled out. This is the mechanism created by God and giving much importance to one step only is foolishness.\n\n24.\tExpelling bad gasses generated by indigestion and hyper acidity etc., is as important as the other two steps. The generation of bad gasses must be controlled by taking proper care in the quality and quantity of food taken based on the knowledge of medical science. This bad gas is called as vaata, which is said to be the root of all diseases (vaatokhilarogamuulam). If the desire of the tongue is controlled, most of the diseases are controlled. Prevention of disease is far better than its cure by medicines.\n\n25.\tThere are three important factors in deciding the activities of soul in this world:- i) The influence of the thoughts of sub-conscious state on the soul, which is very powerful and this can be controlled or even totally avoided through true spiritual knowledge only. ii) The food taken by mouth and this can be controlled by spiritual knowledge only, which controls or even totally destroys the fascination of tongue and iii) the input of information into mind and this is also rectified by spiritual knowledge only through association with spiritual people.\n\n26.\tThe above said three factors are responsible for all the activities of the soul that decide its fate. Spiritual knowledge is the most important fundamental medicine that gives the right direction to the soul to reach the right goal in right path. The knowledge given by human incarnation is unadulterated medicine, which is very powerful. I don’t need any fruit or any favour from any soul since I am fully contented with My infinite wealth, which is this creation. There is nothing, which is not attained or to be attained by Me as said in the Gita. I aspire for the fruit from the souls only to test their real devotion to Me and this is the basis of Krishna stealing butter from the houses of Gopikas. It was done to test their reaction. Some felt very happy and gave butter even secretly to Krishna in the way while going to Madhura city! Some complained to His mother asking that why He should steal butter when plenty of butter is in His house. The former went to Goloka and the latter were robbed by robbers when they were taken by Arjuna to his city! This means that storage of fruit for self-enjoyment only without some sacrifice at least, will result in total loss only in the end. This truth was preached by Krishna through stealing.\n\n27.\tSome say that they are not attached by the worldly issues even though they are surrounded by such issues like the lotus flower in water as said in the Gita. This is possible only for God entering this world and any soul will be affected by the surrounding external atmosphere. Hence, sage Vashishta told while preaching Rama that staying far from the worldly issues as far as possible is always the safest way for any ordinary soul. For a soul, except the responsible duties, it is better to avoid the worldly issue and be in spiritual association. Minimisation of worldly association is always a better path for ordinary soul aspiring spiritual progress. Worldly issues other than basic responsibilities will be also proved as unnecessary, if verified by analysis.\n\n28.\tYou must realize internal meaning of the path of Yoga without being carried away by the external representations. The first five wheels (Chakras) represent the attractions to the five elements of world. The sixth wheel represents the initial state of awareness or mind placed between eye-brows, which is to be controlled by strong concentration of vision or observation. This is the meaning of concentration of both eyes in the centre of eye-brows .The seventh wheel on the top of the head represents intelligence or faculty of analysis with the help of which alone You can attain God. God is present in the centre of this wheel. Kundalini or serpent indicates the awareness or nervous energy travelling as waves. Scholars only can understand the concepts represented by this pictorial system. Fools are carried away by the external pictures.\n\n29.\tThe kundalini sleeps in the first wheel representing solidified ignorance or Tamas in the first wheel containing solid earth. The awakening of this awareness is spiritual realization that makes it to travel crossing all the six hurdles to reach the top most God. The curved journey of the awareness indicates that You can proceed towards God by handling the obstructions tactfully without hurting them. This tactful procedure is not a sin in Nivrutti and same becomes sin in Pravrutti. If You cheat the worldly bonds to go to God, it is not sin. If You cheat the worldly bonds to go to a prostitute, it is sin. If the awareness goes in straight way, the rotating wheels will cut it in to pieces and further journey is stopped.\n\n30.\tThe wheel representing mind contains a lotus flower with two petals representing name and form (Naama ruupa), which is this world attracting Your mind. This wheel is called as Ajnaa, which means the order of Your preacher expressed as spiritual preaching. You must concentrate Your vision on such order so that You can cross the attraction of this world. The Seventh wheel contains a lotus flower with thousand (many) petals indicating that You should analyze every concept in many directions to find out the ultimate truth that exists in its centre.\n\n31.\tIt is said that Idaa nerve or Moon (departed souls live on moon) is on the left side representing the path of departed ancestors associated with worldly fascinations. The right nerve is Pingalaa or Sun (from Sun heaven starts) representing the path of angels doing good deeds. The central nerve is Sushamnaa representing the divine path to reach God indicating that You should avoid both sides and be involved in the straight path of service to God only.\n\n32.\tThe left side cool moon represents sweet devotion. The right side sun represents intensive hot knowledge. With the help of these two, the central nerve represents practice involving service with sacrifice to God. Such soul goes through the central nerve to the abode of God called as Brahmaloka. This is the essence of Yoga preached by Me. Ignorant disciples can’t catch the central essence and are carried away by the superficial attractions of figures and get confused. One foolish devotee tore the body of his wife to see these wheels with lotus flowers! Wheels mean whirl-pools are attractions of worldly bonds in this world ocean and if the swimmer (spiritual aspirant) is caught by these on the way, he will be constantly rotating in those only. Lotus flowers are also the same attractions, which attract the black bee-soul (black indicating Tamas or ignorance) and bind it by the closer of petals.\n\n33.\tThe Gita mentions both theoretical detachment from the fruit (Tyaktvaa karmaphalaasangam...) and also the practical sacrifice of the fruit (phalam tyaktvaa maneeshinah). Some clever people, who are selfish in enjoying the final fruit without a trace of sacrifice, interpret that the practical sacrifice of the fruit also means the theoretical detachment from the fruit! This is the climax of their greediness and hats off to their intelligence for giving such misinterpretation to cover their greediness! Social service without God leads the soul to temporary heaven. Same social service based mainly on God leads the soul to the abode of God. Heaven is near to the abode of God. The path to heaven is success in Pravrutti, which is the only expectation of God from every soul in order to maintain the balance of this creation. Nivrutti is started only by some climax devotees because Nivrutti gives eternal fruit in which God takes all the responsibilities. In Pravrutti, the devotee is fully responsible for his journey to heaven or hell.\n\n34.\tKnowledge, devotion, service with sacrifice and preservation of time and energy (Yoga) are equally important in the spiritual journey. These four are the four dogs present near My feet. The main point is that You should leave all unnecessary worldly works other than basic responsibilities and You must concentrate Your rest time and energy in the work of God. Peace comes when all the unnecessary worldly works are leftover.\n\n35.\tSometimes, My illusory power drags You from the continuous spiritual effort to give You some gap for a fresh reapproach. Gap is essential in any contentious work. Due to this gap, the soul feels very much pained and rededicates himself/ herself with double vigour. Narada says that the devotee is agitated much due to gap (tat vismarane paramavyaakulataa), which is a test of true devotion. It is just like the culvert stopping the flow of water to double its speed afterwards. Hence, My maayaa always helps the soul in spiritual journey and never becomes hurdle if You understand properly.\n\n36.\tIf I lose the hope about a soul that it will not be reformed, I will cancel the rest longevity and throw it into cycle of births of animals. If I feel that the soul needs some more time to complete the spiritual effort, I extend the longevity. Longevity is not fixed and it is in the hands of God only. Even astrological scripture says this point while describing the 8th house or longevity of a horoscope.\n\n37.\tThe scale of time must be also understood in the proper essence. A devotee developing interest (shraddha which is important in the case of departed souls) on God treats one day wasted as one year (pitrumaanam). A more ripened higher devotee feels one day wasted as one year (Devamaanam). Time is limited even if You are in the spiritual path and there is no time if You are in the path of materialism only.\n\n38.\tHuman beings are recognised by Tamas or ignorance. Departed souls are recognised by ritual work or Rajas. Angels are recognised by knowledge or sattvam. A spiritual aspirant is beyond these three, travelling towards God and helped always by these three directed towards God.\n\n39.\tA medicine may be bitter, but removes illness and gives good health to the patient. Spiritual association is like this. A sweet is pleasant, but, kills the patient. Worldly association is like this. You must use analysis with Your intelligence to find out which is helpful and which is harmful to You.\n\n40.\tMoney and energy can be earned again, if lost. Time lost can never be earned. Hence, saving Your time is the first step in Yoga. If You are caught by the association of a bad friend or relative, You should act as if You are hearing him and internally think about God. If such talent is absent in You, You must frankly refuse the participation and go away to join good spiritual association. Friendship or relationship is not greater than Your spiritual effort done to get the grace of God.\n\n41.\tThe expenditure of time and energy can be on one form of God or several forms of God. The method of expenditure can be one or many like reading spiritual books, hearing devotional songs, doing service to God etc. Whether You deposit Rs.100 in one bank or in four equal parts in four banks, there is no difference in the final result.\n\n42.\tThe true devotion to God without aspiration for any fruit in return is the correct genuine currency, which is valid. The false devotion to God with aspiration for some fruit in return is invalid like fake currency. With genuine currency, You can go to any shop, it is fruitful. With fake currency, You can go to any shop, it is harmful. Any path to any shop is immaterial and everything depends only on one point that whether Your currency is genuine or fake.\n\n43.\tMind is very unstable aspiring for a change in every step. Unity and concentration are against to the nature of mind. If You put spiritual effort, which is not congenial to the nature of mind, the mind-horse rebels against You, which results in Your fall! The more You control it, the more quick is Your fall! Change of form of God or change of method of worship is not going to cause any loss to You. Then, why shall You be rigid in wasting Your time and energy to control the mind.\n\n44.\tEvery soul argues that its deed is not a sin. The crow also kisses its child. The judgement shall be never given by any party. Only the impartial judge gives the final judgement, which alone is true. Hence, the impartial God shall decide whether You have done the sin or not. You may catch a red fire piece of charcoal thinking it as red gem. Based on Your thinking, will it not burn Your hand? God alone knows anything what it is actually. You must know what it is in the view of God and act accordingly.\n\n45.\tAn egoistic soul with Rajas thinks that whatever is done by it is justified. An ignorant soul also with Tamas thinks that whatever is done by it is justified. A soul having no ego and no ignorance is with Sattvam and understands exactly My actual view to become the impartial judge like Me to decide its course of action.\n\n46.\tIn doing the ritual for departed souls, there are two places:- one is the place of God (Vishvedevasthaanam) and the other is the place of the departed soul (Pitrusthaanam). The ritual is nothing but prayer to God to protect the departed soul presented before God. Here, Your respect to God is more important than Your respect to the departed soul. You have taken Your diseased father to the doctor. You must concentrate on respecting the doctor so that the pleased doctor will treat Your father with more care. On such occasion, if You neglect the doctor and go on respecting Your father for his property-will, You may be benefited, but not Your father. Hence, the doer shall more concentrate on the place of God than the place of departed soul. In any ritual, concentration of God is the main aspect.\n\n47.\tEvery soul is basically selfish to worship God for its benefit only. Even the soul aspiring for salvation wants to enjoy My bliss. Hence, Shankara told that He is not aspiring for salvation also (Na mokshasyaakaamkshaa...). Unless this basic selfishness is removed, no soul can get My real grace. Selfishness is the root disease like diabetes is the root of several complications. The self can be forgotten when the soul gets attracted to Me. This attraction to God comes only from the knowledge of God. Such attraction resulting in sacrifice and service (practical proof of theoretical devotion) gets My full grace. This concept can be very easily understood by anybody by keeping his/her issues in My place.\n\n48.\tIf one is reciting Gayatri hymn catching the cross belt, he need not be called as Braahmana. If one is wearing saffron cloth and a long stick in hand, he need not be called as saint or samnyaasi. The internal meanings shall be satisfied. Braahmana means that person, who has the true knowledge of God and directs the society towards God. Samnyaasi means that person, who is ripened in the spiritual knowledge of God and dedicates himself in the service of God leaving all the worldly activities. Gayatri means singing sweet songs on God and the cross belt with three threads means that one should catch God in human form and the three threads represent the three components of the medium of God, which are awareness (Sattvam), inert energy (Rajas) and inert matter (Tamas). Saffron colour represents the ripened state of a fruit, which is the ultimate divine state. The stick (Danda or control) indicates the control of senses towards attractions of worldly bonds.\n\n49.\tBrahmana concentrates on Me, the mediated God, for easy worship indicating the path to the contemporary human incarnation, called as Satguru. Samnyaasi reveals the mechanism of incarnation and explains the importance of the root-source unimaginable God in the absolute plane. If a preacher explains that unimaginable God and incarnation are one and the same due to perfect monism resulting from total merge, such a preacher is called as Braahmana Samnyaasi irrespective of reference of caste or gender or religion in this context.\n\n50.\tThe four castes are made by God based on their qualities and deeds. The caste is not by birth. Braahmana is that person, who preaches spiritual knowledge to the entire society leading them to God. Kshatriya is that person, who travels in the spiritual path with immense courage defeating all the opposing hurdles. Vyshya is that person concentrating on God while attending the worldly responsibilities also. Shudra is that person, who concentrates on materialistic world only without any taste for spiritual knowledge. By such worldly attachments, he is always weeping with tensions. This word comes from the root verb ‘Shuk,’ which means worried. You can’t say that the genes carry on the qualities from father to son and so on. It is wrong because genes carry on some mannerisms only and not the qualities. The qualities depend upon the sub-conscious state of the individual soul, which may enter any womb as directed by God’s constitution. The untouchables are from all the four castes, who are banned for their sinful activities. The issue of untouchable need not be untouchable. Several great scholars and great devotees exist born in untouchables. Untouchable is like debarred student from the college and if he is reformed, he is again admitted in to the college. Shankara fell on the feet of an untouchable, unable to answer his question!\n\n51.\tApart from the above mentioned communities, there is one community called as atheists, who are very very rigid to oppose the unimaginable God even though they observe unimaginable miracles with their big big eyes! They are fully occupied by emotion regarding the exploitations of some bad people in the name of God and religion. We agree that the exploitations always exist and are true. Because of some bad students, who copied and passed the examination, You can’t cancel the very system of examination. You have to invent some ways to prevent such crimes. In every system, mistakes take place and You can’t cancel all the systems. Hence, the final order of God Datta is that a caste shall be decided based on qualities and deeds only and not by birth.\n\n52.\tBrahmachaaree doesn’t mean the person, who is unmarried. It means a person, who is always absorbed in God. Sage Vashishtaa, who got 100 issues through his wife Arundhati claimed himself as Sadaa Brahmachaaree (always bachelor), which was accepted by Ganga river! Upavaasi doesn’t mean the person, who is not eating. It means that person, who is staying very close to God. Sage Durvaasa eating meals every day served by Arundhati claimed himself as Nitya-upavasi (not eating on any day) and it was accepted by Ganga river! When Narada asked God Brahma about the real Brahmachaaree in the entire creation, Brahma showed His finger towards Krishna, who married 16,000 girls! This is correct because the unimaginable God (Brahman) is totally merged in Him. When Narada asked about a chaste lady, his finger pointed Gopika. A chaste lady is that soul (every soul is treated as female prakruti and God alone is treated as the only one male or purusha), which is always interested in God Krishna!\n\n53.\tVaanaprastha aashrama doesn’t mean to go to forest along with wife. It only means to go to a lonely place with trees along with a co-devotee for spiritual discussion. Samnyaasa doesn’t mean leaving the house and family, wearing a saffron cloth. It only means the ripened state of a fruit having saffron colour and sweet taste like devotion to God. Vaanaprastha means simple going to garden or forest and this word doesn’t indicate the association of wife. Samnyaasa means total absorption (in God) and this word doesn’t indicate saffron cloth.\n\n54.\tIn Upanayanam, the cross belt with three threads is worn indicating that only the mediated God shall be caught for worship. In marriage, another cross belt is taken with three threads from the hands of father-in-law and second cross belt belongs to the bride. After marriage, the husband worships God while the wife performs all the house hold duties like cooking etc., by which the husband is facilitated in his spiritual effort. Hence, half of the fruit of the spiritual effort done by the husband comes to wife and half of food cooked by wife is taken by husband. This means that the husband shall share the spiritual conclusions with his wife at the end of analysis. Similarly, the wife shall share the food with her husband at end of cooking. Like this, mutual co-operation proceeds even in the final stage of salvation. If the wife becomes a co-devotee, she can follow her husband in Vaanaprastha, otherwise, not. Ubhayabharati followed her husband Mandanamishra even in Samnyaasa.\n\n55.\tThe cross belt containing three threads indicate Me only, the one God seen as three divine forms. The second cross belt having three threads indicates Me only to be worshipped by wife. In some places, a third cross belt with three threads is also taken, which indicates the upper garment. When the inner sense is understood well, there is no need of its representation-symbol in the final respected stage called Samnyaasa. The samnyaasi is respected by all and is not scolded for leaving the cross belt.\n\n56.\tIn the ritual called Upanayanam, the deity to be worshipped is not a female form called as Gayatri since the deity mentioned is God Savita. (Savitaa devataa Gayatree chandah). Gayatri represents only the mode of worship, which is singing. Song (Samaveda) is more attractive then poem (Rugveda) and poem is more attractive than prose (Yajurveda). Samaveda is told to be greatest among all the Vedas and this means that song is the highest attraction of mind. Savita means God, who creates this world of souls (shuunj-praaniprasave). Savita also means sun indicating the removal of ignorance-darkness by the spiritual preacher, who is promoter of intelligence.\n\n57.\tThe cross belt having three threads indicate the contemporary human incarnation called as Sadguru, who shall be approached for the true guidance in the spiritual path. All the essence of this ritual indicates the general spiritual procedure to be followed by any soul in this world irrespective of caste, gender and religion. The sage of this ritual is Vishvaamitra indicating friend, philosopher and guide for the entire world. Universality of this ritual is very clear if its essence is properly understood.\n\n58.\tGayatri doesn’t mean a Vedic hymn existing in meter called as Gayatri. Any song in any language towards God is Gayatri (Gaayantam traayate). Mantra means the song which attracts the mind without any force and makes the soul to repeat it again and again (manaanaat traayate). This is the meaning of Gayatri Mantra to be praised as the highest mode of worship (Na Gayatryaah paro mantrah).\n\n59.\tDevotees take the garland of beads and go on repeating the name of God with counting the beads. In this process, there is no natural attraction because the repetition of same name not only bores the devotee but also bores Me to hear the same word again and again. The force behind such unnatural process is only aspiration for some fruit by doing that. The actual interpretation of the garland of beads is like this — each bead represents a letter and the garland of beads represents a line of song that attracts the mind. The movement of garland in circular way by hand represents natural repetition of such attractive song again and again. This interpretation makes God to be pleased since attraction of mind spontaneously exists without any external force of aspiration for fruit. Experience is said to be the final stage of authority. What will be Your experience if somebody goes on repeating Your name in Your ear? What will be Your experience if somebody sings a sweet song praising Your personality again and again?\n\n60.\tPeople criticize that Manu in his ethical scripture told that a female shall not have freedom (Na streeh svaatantryamarhati). This is misunderstood that a lady shall be always kept under house arrest! The human souls immediately take the misinterpretation only in the first step. Female means any soul and not a female by gender. Male or Purusha means God. No soul should have freedom to get spoiled. If the soul is under the control of God, the soul will be uplifted in the spiritual path.\n\n61.\tAny soul can come out of the attraction of this world due to stronger attraction to God. This can’t be reverse. After tasting divine nectar, all the other drinks are naturally rejected. By rejecting all the drinks in the beginning itself, You can’t attain the divine nectar. Only after tasting the divine nectar, You are rejecting other drinks spontaneously without any external force. Such spontaneous detachment from world comes only after getting attracted to God.\n\n62.\tAttachment to something through attraction is the nature of mind. The mind can’t exist in detachment to everything for a long time. In order to follow the nature of mind, You must attach it to God in the first stage. Then, without any effort, the mind gets detached spontaneously from the world. This is seen in the world also. A young man attracted by a very beautiful girl becomes spontaneously detached from all the worldly attractions. Hence, detachment from world (Vyraagya) is a spontaneous consequence of attachment to God (Bhakti). Through the former, latter can’t be attained in spite of hectic efforts. Through the latter, the former is spontaneously attained.\n\n63.\tJustice is the top most priority in My view. Never hurt the justice by following injustice in sinful way. If justice is just hurt, I reach the climax of anger. If You injure justice, imagine the state of My anger towards You! You have to come to Nivrutti after passing in Pravrutti and not by neglecting Pravrutti. If You fail in Pravrutti and damage justice, You are banned from Nivrutti. A person, who can’t jump and touch the roof of his house, how can You expect him to jump and touch the sky?\n\n64.\tDon’t imitate Me seeing My stealing butter and dancing with Gopikas in Brundaavanam without understanding the background. They are sages doing severe penance for Me in millions of previous births. I tested them in the three strong worldly bonds before giving salvation to them in their final birth. After leaving Brundaavanam in My 18th year, neither I returned nor I repeated such test anywhere else throughout My life. Human souls are always fond of exploitation of the truth in their interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n65.\tThe minimum and maximum expectation from You is only that You should follow the path of justice and never do any sin under any circumstances. Damaging any good soul is the climax of injustice. The deity of justice called as ‘Yamadharma Raja’ was with golden colour in the early ages since he was enquiring mostly good people only. After beginning of this Kali age, he is enquiring only bad people. Due to the effect of the sins of these bad people, he became jet black!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwww.universal-spirituality.org\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace",

        "text": "I still can’t get the song out of my head, the medications they keep bringing me won’t stop it, sleep doesn’t stop it, right now we are doing a group activity to write and express what brings us in here, it does not have to be perfect, but it should help us reflect on our problems and find ways to solve them. I’m just afraid that writing down my problems won’t solve anything, I don’t think anything we do here will fix any of my problems.\r\n\r\n  About six months ago I went to bed as I normally do, I went to bed after taking a shower, no snacks, meals, not even a drink. I fell asleep in probably about thirty minutes and dreamt I was cleaning and old room and getting everything ready to move into. I soon got a phone call from a bright red phone that looked like it was made from some very cheap plastic. I picked it up and the song “Sweet Caroline” began to play softly in the background as I heard a woman’s voice calmly say “her name was Caroline” and she went quiet and I asked back “what?” and the woman grew louder “HER NAME WAS CAROLINE!” and the phone hung up. I woke up and decided to sleep again after a few minutes to gather my thoughts. I was in the same room, but this time I walked out and stayed away and explored the rest of my dream, but after a typical dream experience, I walked through a door and back into the room. The phone began to ring like it did before. I picked it up heading the same voice and song “her name was Caroline. HER NAME WAS CAROLINE!” and then the dial tone once more as she hung up.\r\n\r\n  My wife saw how tired I still felt even after sleeping in early and waking up later. “Baby, are you ok?” she asked me as I looked at her with dead eyes. “Yes babe, just had some weird dreams. After work I’ll get some better sleep.” I then went to work exhausted. Afterwards I came back home and washed up, spent some time with my wife, and then went off to bed. I was back in the same room and that song was playing as if through a speaker, and the phone began to ring. I was hesitant to pick it up, but still did so automatically. “HER NAME WAS CAROLINE” it screamed as I felt her warm breath through the phone. I quickly made my way through the door and did what I could to wake up. I decided to just run in front of a car and woke up, oddly enough with a bloody nose.\r\n\r\n  This is when I decided to start buying caffeine pills, energy drinks, and anything that I felt would help me stay awake. This is where I made my biggest mistake. After a few days, I began to see shadows walking around and my anxiety began to skyrocket. I would take naps to help stave off the shadowy predators, but nothing could prepare me for the next problem, I kept checking my phone seeing missed calls and one voicemail. “HER NAME WAS CAROLINE” that same voice yelled as that stupid song would play. I tried showing my wife, but the voicemail would be deleted somehow. I don’t know what is happening or how this dream demon manages to do these things, but I am losing my mind.\r\n\r\n  After another month I would hear the song play repeatedly and my phone began to ring every minute. I had to break my phone, but she would just call my wife. My wife wouldn’t even hear it, but I could! I threw her phone off of our floor and shattered it. This is where she drew the line. She called EMS to come and get me to help take me to a hospital. The sounds of the song was so loud, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I saw a shadow run towards me and I took off even as my wife called for me to come back. I was trapped in a room as the shadow got closer. As she got close to me the paramedics came and soon I woke up in a bed here. I don’t know what happened, but the doctors had to help me with torn ligaments around my wrists and ankles, they found dark bruises around my neck, the best explanation they could find was that it may have been from my delusions. I know I am not delusional and I know if I leave, she will kill me.\r\n\r\n  Last night I could see her more clearly through the window of the door and my anxiety began to rise. I apologize to everyone here for my yelling, but when I felt her nails on my skin through the reflection, I began to realize I am slowly becoming less safe even here. I know I am not insane, but I do belong here because even if my safety is dwindling, it is still safer here than on my own. I want to apologize to my wife for all the problems I have been causing because of this haunting spirit. I pray that I may see you again free of this evil spirit, but I believe this may be the last statement I will make. To all my loved ones, I love you and I hope I can see all of you again.",

        "text": "On the passenger side of my late husband, Percy's 1932 Model 18. He was so thrilled about the new found transportation so much, so Percy could not possibly fall silent about the car, it became too annoying. Remembering all his rambles about this same vehicle that I watched the cold rain fall onto from the somewhat warmth of the interior. A sudden  collision with his tire to a rock bounces me out of my noseical day dreaming back  into the grim reality of him being departed from this world onto the next. Examining the individual soul on the right of me was a young bloke who couldn't have been older than nineteen. He had offered to drive Percy's car from the crime scene. He took me back, back to Percy's comfortable British home which was appearing closer and closer by every tier turn. Turning the key terminating the life of the ford ending the drive I stay seated till the young gentleman opens my door taking my hand. \n\nMy rounded heel and Soft Leather Oxford places firmly on the driveway looking up to the house we had once called ours. It entered with a front room off a hall leading into a second living room at the rear and a kitchen. Upstairs consisted of two large bedrooms, a third much smaller room ment for the wonderful child we had planned for but for now would lay vacant, and last a single bathroom including toilet and washing tub. “...Ophelia back?” A hesitant voice sounded into my ears gazing to the left, finally taking a good look at my driver's looks. His suit vests fell out of favor as an excess use of fabric looked as if they were made with a wool-ray blend. I blanked with a short “yes?” turing to face him “...d..does this make you a black widow” he stutters with a smile full nerves “i- i mean like the spider” i sigh with a knowing he was trying to ease my pain with that in mind with confidence i inquire “of course i'm a very venomous female” i tell i have left a bit flustered with fear by his expression after that was said i headed inside to Percy and mines room.\n\nIt's been awhile since then my closet now just holds dark shades of black i believe that conversation was the last one I had since my dear love had left from all existence. I grab Percy's black button up trench coat and his small round hat putting it on my light brown pigtail braids. Out the door i go belineing for his ford my hands shaking i pull out his keys trembling to unlock the door and climb into his driver seat. A single tear falls knowing where i must go for closer i go to the hills. Leaving his ford in the road I jump out slamming the door shut starting a journey up on the rocky trail head above although just starting my hike i find my destination ending my short hike. Now standing on this rugged hill observing a hazardous back widows river going right through the center of a large hushfull v- shaped valley infested with a handful of dark green forest trees where Percy's grave was resting, a shovel still resting against the tree where I had set it.\n\nThe sunset I had been standing in soon fades and becomes black like my clothes. Looking onward down a road appears into view where his same 1932 Model 18 ford stood still. Cracks of lightning shatter the dark skyes the unbreakable glass the lightning bolts are like cracks that cause this glass to shatter. Starting to travel I start to smell the running river water full of vigorous fish of many kinds. I was disturbed out of my mesmerization from the rush of the water ahead by high pitched barks and yips, with each consisting of lyrics. Coyotes were hunting with their pups near the trees like how a black widow eats her mate after intercouse. In the sudden alarm that came to stab me with intense dread of a warning there feeding time. Now being hunted I race forward to the now soothing sound of angry water clashing . approaching the edge of the roaring river front, the only chance of me not becoming the main cause of a carnivorous animal was to cross the great oak that had fallen years ago to get on the other side,The side to safety. As each step is taken I can feel the age within the tree. In the dark I lose footing, falling into the rough flow of water beneath the tree where I once stood. With water replacing my air washing away the sins I should deeply regret though I do not, I sink with the great sins and become one with this hazardous waterways history.",

        "text": "Hi, my name is Sarah (15). Now here me out: Since recently I am getting more and more weird and creepy hallucinations and I'm starting to believe they're real. So it all started a week ago.\n\nIt was a Monday I was sitting alone on my table in school. We had math at that moment and I was very tired cause of the party on Sunday. As I was thinking about other things like my boyfriend when my math teacher suddenly screamed at me. This happens very often cause I always zoom out and they never understand it. But this time. He didn't just go on with the lesson. He came to my table and started to talk about how I never focus and such but I wasn't paying attention to him. One of my classmates started to scratch his arm. At first, it was slow and soft. But it got faster and harder until I could see his own flesh getting ripped of his arm. But he didn't stop, no he kept going, on and on. No screams, no pain nothing. I didn't even understand how he scratched it so hard. I was in complete fear and confusing. I screamed: \"Stop it ryan!\" But when he looked behind me. His wound... Gone. Completely. Nothing on his hands nothing on his arm. A short quiet second passed and everyone was looking at me. I was never so confused and scared in my entire life. That's when the teacher got so angry. I don't even remember what he said but I know he screamed at the top of his lungs cause almost everyone in the school was looking trough the windows from the hallway. I also detention afterwards.\n\nThat wasn't the only time. The next day I walk around with my friends and we talk a bit. I told them about what happend on Monday but the moment I said something they immediately interupped me. I tried again and I again but they either ignored it or again interupped me. Until they all stopped. Silens filled the streets as the wind stopped.\n\nI couldn't see their faces but at that moment. I heard something. A giggle so wicked and evil the fear flew down my body. I heard it all around me. I wanted to run but I couldn't move a single part of my body. Nothing, the fear glued me right to the place I was standing. As I looked to my friends I immediately regretted that decision. All of them were looking at me. Smiling with reddish eyes and black liquid all over their bodys. They walked to me as their smile became bigger and the giggling got louder. Finally, I ran. I ran as far as I could leaving everything behind. My backpack, my phone I dropped and my keys. I look behind me a last time as I see my friends standing there in complete confusion. Again I was fooled by my own mind.\n\nThis went on and on like that and the hallucination appeared more often and felt realer. I thought it couldn't go worse after I broke my arm when running as fast as I can into a tree which I haven't seen in my hallucination. But then, Sunday night at the hospital. I laid in my bed and couldn't sleep the whole time. The fear of having another hallucination kept me up all night. \n\nSpeaking of the devil I hear a knock. Not 3 or 4 just one. One single strong knock at my door. I was staring at the door. Not blinking at all. That went on for 2 minutes until I finally blinked. And that... Was a mistake. That single blink was enough for the demonic thing behind the door to come in. There it was, standing right in front of my bed. I didn't look at it but I heard it's screeching breath. That's all I remember from that point. \n\nAfter that day, I never had any hallucinations again but sometimes. I still hear the screeching breath right behind me. Since then, no one wants to talk or look at me. I don't know why, even my parents are like that. They fear me. Everytime they accidentally look at me they scream and immediately send me to my room. Everyone is like that. They run or attack me. So most of the days I sit in my room and only come out if my parents are gone or I have to go to the toilet. Since they go away often I can atleast eat something. \n\nI don't know what to do at this point anymore. \n\n2 Weeks have passed now. I wanted to post this but I kinda forgot. But I have some updates about the situation. The screeching breath I sometimes hear is now always next to me. It has gotten worse, far worse. I'm a dangerous target for the police which is after me. I don't know why, I haven't killed or hurt anyone. But I'm on the run. \n\nTo get my phone charged up I hide in the mass of people and charge it at a public charger. I have a mask and sunglasses at all times but I don't know how long I can hide from the security and all the people continuously looking for me. If they find me they won't hesitate to shoot me. Defently not. \n\nThis breathing is like a second person. It's sometimes talking to me. Helping me run away. I don't know what it is but it could be why everyone is scared of me so I try to get rid of it. But the thing is. I can't get rid of something I don't even see or know. I don't even know at which part of my body it is. But it surely has to be seen somewhere on my body or the people wouldn't run away when seeing me. I tried to feel it by touching my face but there was nothing I felt. It all felt normal like I would be a normal person. This is getting out of hand and the more I am alone the more it talkes to me. Sometimes it even tells me to hurt others. \n\nWhen I try to look into the camera or any reflection of me the thing what reflects gets destroyed or disappears (Mirrors break, Camera doesn't work, puddles dissapear etc.). I avoid to see my reflection at all costs cause first of all. A mirror or a window at night breaking out of nowhere would draw the attention to me which is very bad. Secondly I could get hurt ot destroy something very big cause it reflects everywhere. \n\nAll I can eat is some bread I buy through begging at the streets. This is not where I should be. I wanted to be a happy girl living in a big house with my boyfriend. But that's not my situation. My boyfriend even tried to kill me once. Just like my parents and mostly everyone who has seen my face.\n\nI want to live my normal life as a school girl. I don't want this to end with me dying trough police or anyone else. Does someone have any idea for me? If someone could just help me or know that I mean no harm I would be more happy then ever. \n\nIf do not reply I am probably dead. So I want to say this to everyone I have known. My parents, my ex, my friends and my teacher:\n\n I will \"never\" forgive you.",

Does it make your mouth water?** \n\nImagine if you walked into a funeral parlor, and that aroma wafted off the skin of every individual weeping over the casket. \n\nThe line between most great written works and those perceived as the insane ramblings of a madman is one of comprehension. So today I will do my best to convey to you this contention with utmost clarity. That contention is that there is an omnipresent being feeding off of the misery of all of humanity. \n\nI call this creature the Misery Feeder, and where misery goes it follows. It's like the holy ghost-- if the holy ghost lived off human suffering.\n\nFor many, they have inherited misery as a sort of heirloom. For others, they have been gifted it by someone they knew, or by a particular occurrence in their life. Some discover it by themselves, like a ghost under a street lamp.\n\nUltimately it does not matter how someone came upon their own personal tragedy; The Misery Feeder feasts just the same.\n\nI believe it was born out of necessity. Like an equalizer for humanity. A parasite with the ultimate energy source, the ultimate prey: the only species with the capacity to understand and conceptualize the nature of suffering. The only species that can write sonnets, paint paintings, and conduct symphonies manifested out of misery. Some say art is something one must suffer for– as if the act of creation itself is not worthwhile enough to be revered. It is philosophies like this that could only be conducted by the minds of men. And it is for that reason that the minds of men are the ultimate energy source for a creature such as this.\n\nMisery is not beautiful, no. Take a look at anyone actually in the depths of despair, you won’t find beauty there. For this misery feeder, however, there is something much more than aesthetic appeal to be found– the ultimate culinary experience, a feast infinite.\n\nEdvard Munch, for example, his tragedy of losing all he loved to disease, not only ill but tormented by lifelong dyspraxia– his only solace, the melancholy of a brush and canvas– is that beautiful to you?\n\nHis 1892 painting “Despair” comes to mind. The portrait of a faceless silhouette slouched over a bridge rail, unacknowledged, hardly even a person at all. It makes you wonder what that silhouette may have been contemplating; it makes you wonder if that fire-red sky had a sound. Edvard was a man who experienced incredible grief in his life, and I imagine that if the misery feeder ever met him, it would love him as much as it was capable, for being a man whose suffering was a thick miasma, rivaling that of even cities full of people. I’d imagine it was very disappointed to find him dead, just as one would feel upset upon finding that their favorite restaurant had gone out of business.\n\nI’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nMy argument is one of logic. It is simple. A creature such as this *has* to exist, not because humanity’s inherent terror is something that could only exist independently of themselves– just the opposite actually. Misery is inherent to your race. You have evolved to feel things so wholly that you seem to have lost all sense of self-preservation in the process.\n\nHow would such miserable creatures be able to persevere if there were not some outside force keeping them alive? How would such creatures have not all shot themselves, if life is so desolate? How would such irrational, stupid, impulsive animals not have all nuked themselves already? They have the means to do so. They want to, oh how they long for self-destruction. How they fantasize. How they yearn to vanish themselves.\n\n**I’m sure you’ve figured it out by now.**\n\nYou don’t make it easy, you know.\n\nEven now, I am the sole force standing between billions of lives lost to suicide. Every week I narrowly stop a government official from annihilating a neighboring country. I have evolved alongside your species, beginning as a simple parasite, and, 117 billion lives later, I am become beyond god. Much like viruses and bacteria, the relationship between us has become much more mutualistic. It is in my best interest to eat, so it is in my best interest to keep you all alive.\n\n*Fuck. The smell these days. It’s incredible.*\n\nYou might be wondering why I’m sharing this with you. I’m not entirely sure myself. Maybe somewhere inside of me, I want to assure all of you miserable little smorgasbords that even when you feel most alone, I’m there. In your darkest moments, I will always be with you. The voice in your head telling you to wait another day. The invisible hand on the dial, keeping the launch codes unseen. The gun jamming. The random text.\n\nSo, next time you’re upset, feel reassured.\n\nFeel reassured by the fact that you are never truly alone.\n\nFeel reassured by the fact that nuclear destruction is not imminent.\n\nFeel reassured by me, everpresent, **eternally eating you.**",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10qkqnk/dont_play_the_can_you_hide_game_if_it_appears_on/",
        "text": "You won’t find it on Google Play or the App Store. There’s nothing about the game on any public websites, other than this cautionary post. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a good or a bad person. It indiscriminately chooses targets.\n\nThe point is that you can’t avoid the game.  Nobody can. You might hear a reverberating ding from your phone — a death toll from the depths of Hell.\n\nAn incongruous window might pop up.\n\n&gt;“Can you hide?”\n\n&gt;‘Yes’ — ‘No’\n\nMake sure you select ‘No’.\n\nWhen the window first appeared on my phone screen, I was stunned. I always presumed smartphones to be safer from the threat of viruses than computers. Especially a brand new iPhone. Isn’t Apple supposed to be superior to Microsoft when it comes to security?\n\n“Nice try,” I said.\n\nBut before I made a rash decision and ended up infecting my phone with something nasty, I decided to do some research. I’m not exactly computer-savvy, but I didn’t trust either the ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ option. I didn’t want to mess with the window in any way.\n\nThere was nothing about the ‘Can you hide?’ pop-up online. I didn’t even realise it was a game until a Reddit user, who I won’t name, pointed me in the direction of a Discord server for discussing unearthly matters.\n\nThere was an entire category dedicated to the bizarre new game that had been appearing on people’s phones. Clicking ‘Yes’, apparently, commences a hide-and-seek game of unknown origin. I scrolled through the many Discord messages. I’ve removed the usernames.\n\n*User 1: Can anyone help me? Nobody seems to know anything about this game. My friend played it non-stop for a week, and then he went missing. That was two weeks ago. There are daily search parties, but I don’t think they’re going to find him. He said it wasn’t really a game. He said he saw a face outside his window.*\n\n*User 2: You have to select ‘No’.*\n\n*User 3: I destroyed my phone after reading these messages. Haven’t seen or heard anything unusual.*\n\n*User 4: I selected ‘No’, but I keep hearing creaks. And I don’t think it’s in my head.*\n\n*User 6: Just leave the pop-up window open, guys. You don’t have to select anything.*\n\n*User 5: What? For the rest of my life? What if something accidentally knocks it?*\n\n*User 3: Destroy your phone. Like I said, it worked for me.*\n\n*User 6: Until it pops up on your next phone.*\n\n*User 5: What if I just turn off my phone? That seems a little less dramatic than destroying it.*\n\n*User 3: Your funeral.*\n\nThe more I read, the more anxious I felt. I had expected the pop-up window to be a virus, but everybody was telling ghost stories. *Stop being a superstitious baby*, I told myself. *That guy’s disappearance had nothing to do with the game he was playing*.\n\nEventually, after a weekend of horrified contemplation, I opted for User 5’s idea to turn off my phone — in fact, I took it a step farther and reset my phone to its factory settings.\n\nI met my friends, Corey and Tanya, in a local park on Monday afternoon. I’d planned to tell them about my experience, but they beat me to the punch.\n\n“Why didn’t you pick up your phone all weekend, Lee?” Corey asked me. “We were worried about you, man! We wanted to hang out on Sunday.”\n\n“I didn’t fancy third-wheeling. Some of us have to go to work on Mondays,” I replied.\n\n“Hey! I work!” Corey protested.\n\n“From a bathrobe in your bedroom,” Tanya smirked.\n\n“You’re both just envious that I can scroll through Reddit and play games away from the watchful eye of my employer,” Corey said. “Speaking of games, Lee, have you played ‘Can you hide?’?”\n\nMy heart plummeted, and I felt as if Corey’s words were tinder-blocks, dragging my body though the floorboards.\n\n“He’s obsessed,” Tanya sighed. “He’s been playing it every day since Tuesday.”\n\n“It just popped up on my phone, so I thought, ‘Why the fuck not?’” Corey laughed. “Tanya thought it must be a virus, but it’s just a cool augmented reality game.”\n\nCorey thrust his phone down on the wooden picnic table. It was already open on a game window — a map of our surrounding area. A small green marker indicated Corey’s location in the park, and there was a small red marker moving along nearby roads.\n\n“Once a day, from two to four in the afternoon, the game takes place. I have to hide. It tracks my location in the real world, so I have to keep moving. I wanted to delay coming to the park, but I don’t think the red seeker will find me here. Besides, it’s ten to four. Nearly made it,” Corey said.\n\n“What’s the red marker that’s searching for you?” I asked, shuddering.\n\n“The boogeyman,” Corey whispered.\n\nHe laughed, and Tanya thumped him on the arm.\n\n“You know that kind of talk makes Lee freak out,” Tanya scolded.\n\nCorey shrugged, and the pair of them became absorbed in a different topic of conversation. They were tucking into their sandwiches, talking between mouthfuls, but I wasn’t eating. I couldn’t take my eyes off Corey’s phone on the table. The red marker was circling the park, looking for him. I couldn’t stop thinking about those people on the Discord server who had spoken so solemnly of the supposedly-deadly game.\n\nSuddenly, the marker was in the park. Lee was wrong. It had found him. I prepared for something dreadful to happen. I prepared for my friend to be caught.\n\n“And that’s a wrap!” Corey said, scooping up his phone. “Four o’clock. Yet again, I bested the game. It got close this time, though... Damn. Just a hundred yards away!”\n\nOn the game map, the park was a featureless green patch. I could see Corey’s green marker, scarcely standing out from the grass, and I could see the red marker north-east of our location. The victory box read:\n\n“You avoided the Creaker by: 121 yards. You *can* hide.”\n\nTanya groaned and mumbled about Corey’s game addiction, and the two of them resumed their conversation. I was about to dive back into reality, putting the silly game out of my head for good, but a sudden noise terrified me.\n\n*A creak*.\n\nMy eyes shot up from the table. Neither Tanya nor Corey seemed to notice the eerie noise. And I can’t explain it — as nearby as the sound seemed, my eyes were drawn to a solitary tree, a little over a hundred yards away. Perhaps not exactly where the red marker had appeared on Corey’s screen, but close enough.\n\nPeering around the bark was a frightful face. The thing looking at the three of us was not human. It was as short as a toddler. Its head, if it even *had* a head, was wearing a peach-coloured rubber mask — almost the tone of human flesh, but not quite. And its sickly-sweet smile seared through my eyes into my very soul.\n\nWith a second resounding creak, the nightmarish face snapped behind the bark, disappearing from view.\n\n“Earth to Lee,” Tanya said, giggling. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”\n\n“I think somebody’s *actually* seeking you, Corey,” I whispered, pointing a shaky finger at the tree. “I don’t think you should play that game anymore.”\n\n“Your phasmophobia really kills my buzz sometimes, Lee,” Corey sighed. “There’s no boogeyman following me.”\n\nI have a proclivity for trembling at everyday sights and sounds. In my mind, there’s always a ghost or a ghoul around the corner. Ever since my parents died, I’ve been that way. But I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I hadn’t imagined what I saw behind the tree. Unfortunately, my phasmophobia — fear of ghosts and the supernatural — makes it very difficult for anybody to believe me when I’ve been startled by something.\n\nCorey and Tanya told me to take it easy and get lots of rest. The following day, the two of them pinged me incessantly on WhatsApp. I was still reeling from the terrifying thing I’d seen behind the tree. Transfixed by terrible thoughts, the workday flew by. I was starting to believe that maybe I’d become unwell. Perhaps I’d suffered a psychotic break.\n\nNot so.\n\nAround half six in the evening, on my drive home from work, Tanya called me. I answered via my car’s dashboard.\n\n“I’m driving right now, Tanya,” I said. “What’s-”\n\nI trailed off when I heard my friend bawling her eyes out on the other end of the phone.\n\n“It’s in the house,” She whispered. “The… The game started playing. It’s later than usual.”\n\n“Slow down,” I replied. “What’s happening?”\n\n“The game started at six…” Tanya tearfully explained in a fragile whisper. “I think you were right, Lee… I think someone’s *actually* seeking us. We saw a horrible face at the window, and then there were creaking sounds in the house. We’re hiding in the attic. Corey’s pulled the door up, so we don’t think-”\n\n“- Have you called the police?” I interjected, heart pounding.\n\n“They’re on the way,” Tanya said. “Fifteen minutes. If we can… What? It’s Lee. No, I feel safer with someone on the other end of the… Okay! Corey wants me to hang up. He wants us to be quiet.”\n\n“Okay, I understand,” I shakily replied. “Just make sure-”\n\n“- No, no, no…” Tanya whimpered.\n\nI didn’t need to ask what had frightened her. I heard it too. A creak in the attic. It sounded so clear and, once again, so *near*. So nightmarishly near that I snapped my neck around to make sure the rubber-faced demon wasn’t in the back seat of my car. It wasn’t.\n\nAt that point, I decided not to go home. I diverted to Corey’s house. An eight-minute journey. Barely any quicker than the police.\n\n“How did it even get in here?” Tanya whispered. “I didn’t even see the door open.”\n\n“It’s not an ‘it’,” Corey scoffed, though he spoke with a quivering voice. “He’s just a child, and he needs to leave our- Oh…”\n\n“What the fuck is that?” Tanya screamed.\n\n“Please-” Corey began to plead.\n\nThe screams of my two friends were deafening. I was so fixated on reaching the house that I didn’t hang up the call. It was only as I tore onto Corey’s driveway, mere minutes before the police, that I realised I’d been listening to sounds of squelching, snapping, and, most hauntingly of all, creaking.\n\nI barged down the front door and ran up to the attic. I expected to find a sickening scene of mutilation, but the space was empty. Corey and Tanya were gone.\n\nThe police had questions for me, of course, but my alibi was airtight — the 999 call was made before I even left the office, and traffic camera footage corroborated the fact that I was on the road whilst the intruder terrorised Corey and Tanya.\n\nMissing persons. That’s the verdict.\n\nI don’t understand what the game wants. I don’t know where the missing people go. All I know is that resetting my phone wasn’t enough.\n\nOn my drive home, after a long night of tears and police questioning, I could swear I caught a glimpse of a peach-coloured mask peeking around a postbox. And then, as if to confirm that menacing thought, there was a notification on my phone.\n\nThat unmistakable ding of Hell.\n\nThe message displayed on my car dashboard.\n\n&gt;“Can you hide?”\n\n&gt;‘Yes’ — ‘No’\n\nI moaned in horror, and that was what damned me. My car uses voice recognition, and it somehow registered my terrified vocal reaction as an answer.\n\n“You selected ‘No’.”\n\nPerhaps I’ve chosen the safer of the two options. I know many of the Discord users suggested ‘No’, but I can’t stop thinking about what I read on that server.\n\n*I selected ‘No’, but I keep hearing creaks.*\n\nI haven’t heard anything yet, and the game hasn’t started playing. But Corey didn’t seem to hear the creak when he was playing the game. Maybe, like him, I’ve just been missing it.\n\nI’m horrified of the Creaker. I’m horrified of where he might take me.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "“Son of a goddamn bitch!”\n\n\nFrom my perspective, it all happened in slow motion. The nail was tiny, my thumb was large, I really suck at aiming a hammer. I should’ve known better. When my wife asked me to hang up our new family portrait I should’ve said no, or I at least should’ve used a drill and a screw instead. Maybe one of those stick on Command Strips even.\n\n\n“Is everything ok down there honey?” My wife, Sarah, called from upstairs, a note of concern was in her voice, as it wasn’t in my typical fashion to blurt out random obscenities when performing household tasks. The walls in this house were so paper thin I could never hide anything from her.\n\n\n“Fine honey,” this was an absolute lie, as I’m sure she could infer from the audible pain in my voice. \n“Everything’s fine, almost finished hanging the picture!”\n\n\nI held my thumb tightly in my other hand and against my chest, too afraid to look at it. Fuck me, why had I swung so *hard*. I slowly loosened the death grip I had on the thing and peaked at the damage. It was already turning a shade of purple no body part should ever be. A crack ran parallel up my thumbnail and a small bead of blood was protruding out of it.\n“Yeah, I’m definitely losing that nail,” I whispered to myself.\n\n\nI could hear the familiar “tap tap tap” of our Pomeranian, Betsy, walking down the hallway and into the den where I was keeled over in pain. She had always had a knack for knowing when either my wife or I was in distress and this whole thumb debacle was no different.\n\n\n“Betsy, I’m fine! Shoo!” I whispered to her, trying ever so desperately to save myself the embarrassment of having my wife discover that I’m as useless at hanging up a picture as I am at any number of domestic “handy man” chores.\n\n\nBetsy looked at me, head tilted to the side, and started to make a low growling sound before letting out several loud “yelps!”. I knew the jig was up at that point, and I looked over to see Sarah standing in the doorway, arms crossed, brow furrowed and lips pursed in a “what did you do this time?” expression.\n\n\n“It’s nothing, really it’s nothing, I just hit my thumb with the hammer, and now it really, really hurts, but it’s fine. S-see?” I held my thumb up to her and she made a wincing noise and turned her head away from me in revulsion. \n\n\n“You know I hate looking at that sort of stuff! Is it broken? Do you think you should go to the hospital?”\n\n\nI considered this for a moment before dismissing the idea. What were they going to do, bandage me up and give some Tylenol? That’s nothing I couldn’t do for myself here at home and save $350.\n\n\n“No no, of course not, I’m fine. I’ll just take a couple of  aspirin and put a Band-Aid on it and I’ll be right as rain in no time!” I could tell my half hearted smile wasn’t doing a very good job of convincing her, but she relented.\n\n\n“Well, okay, if you say so. I’m going to start cooking dinner. Oh, and don’t worry about the picture, rest that thumb!” She gave me a sly wink and I thought for a moment that maybe I was being overly dramatic. It was only a smashed thumb for Christ’s sake. But it just hurt so goddamn *bad*. I had never hit myself with a hammer before, but surely it wasn’t supposed to hurt *this* bad.\n\n\nAfter dinner I offered to help with the dishes, but thank God Sarah insisted that I go upstairs and get some rest. I had taken four extra strength Tylenol and it didn’t so much as touch the pain I was experiencing in my left thumb. \n\n\n“C’mon Betsy, let’s go to bed girl.” She gave me a contented “yelp!” and followed me upstairs.\n\n\nUp to that point in my life, that was the worst and most fitful night of sleep I had ever had. The throbbing of my thumb permeated into my subconscious. I had strange fever dreams, some as benign as my hand turning into one giant thumb. Others more malevolent, like the one where I repeatedly smashed myself in the head with a hammer, alternating between the face and the claw, pummeling myself over and over again until the pain of my head superseded the pain in my thumb and I finally had relief.\n\n\nI awoke in the middle of the night, dripping in sweat. Betsy bolted upright at the foot of our bed, head tilted in concern. “It’s okay girl, go back to sleep,” I stammered. I stumbled into the bathroom, still half dazed from my nightmares. I flipped on the light and to my absolute horror noticed that the gauze I had wrapped my thumb in was completely soaked in blood. Steadily and nervously I peeled back the bandage, doing everything in my power so as not to alert Sarah or Betsy of my agony. \n\n\nThe thumb had at least doubled in size since I’d last looked at it, but that was far from the most disturbing thing I’d noticed. The small crack in the nail from earlier was now a great fissure, parting it into two equal halves. The nail was a darker purple shade now, with hints of sickly greens and yellows. I turned my hand to inspect the palm side of my thumb. A jagged, sinewy gash ran from the tip all the way down to the soft fleshy area at the base. It was weeping blood and pus and a clear-ish bile that smelled absolutely rancid. I vomited into the sink, almost blacking out from the sheer force of my stomach emptying its contents.\n\n\nI ran the affected area underneath the running water of the sink, ignoring the mess I had made in the basin. I let the water get as hot as I could stand and let it cleanse the sticky mess that was my infected digit. The thumb began twitching and writhing in a pattern that was beyond my control. I applied a new bandage, one with more layers of gauze than the previous one, and splinted the thumb to the rest of my hand with tape. Underneath all of the layers I could still feel it subtlety moving.\n\n\nI opened the medicine cabinet and found an almost untouched bottle of hydrocodone that Sarah was prescribed earlier this year for a tooth infection. I opened the lid and didn’t bother to count how many I dumped into my hand. I ran downstairs and grabbed a bottle of whisky to wash the pills down with. I stumbled to the couch in a daze, praying that I would fall asleep quickly. The last thing I remember from that night was Betsy crawling into my lap before I plunged off the ledge into a dreamless sleep.\n\n\nIn the morning my head ached and my mouth was dry and metallic tasting, but by some miracle my thumb didn’t hurt anymore. For a brief moment I thought the worst was over. I wish I could’ve lived in that moment forever, because that’s when I noticed all the blood that I was covered in. The bandage that I had applied to my hand in the middle of the night was shredded and had been discarded off the the side. Betsy was on the floor, her once snow-white fur caked and matted with red and brown gore, and my left hand was attached firmly to her neck in a choking gesture.\n\n\nThrough the sounds of my sobs and wails and the squelching of Betsy’s ragged flesh, I attempted to free her from the grip that my thumb had on her. It made a ripping sound as it detached from her lifeless body. A tuft of white fur was lodged into the open gash. I carefully removed it and was horrified to find several rows of sharp teeth within the open wound. They jutted out at odd and asymmetrical angles. The teeth were attached to engorged flaps that convulsed open and shut rhythmically, like a Venus flytrap from hell.\n\n\nI scrambled out of the den, past the happy picture of Sarah, Betsy and I that lay un-hung on the floor, and out into the kitchen. I rummaged noisily through every drawer until I found the serrated bread knife. My left hand was of no use in my search, as the teeth of my lamprey-mouthed thumb were firmly implanted into my upper thigh, tearing and gnawing through muscle and tendons. \n\n\nI placed the blade of the knife shakily in between the webbing of my pointer finger and thumb. I was hesitant to make the first cut, but knew it had to be done. As the teeth of the knife imbedded themselves, an intrusive thought of terror entered my mind:\n\n\nWhere was Sarah, and why hadn’t she come downstairs to investigate all the noise I was making?",

        "text": "It feels like I got here yesterday, but I’m already tangled up in a disappearance, a murder, and a town with more secrets than people.\n\nI should give some backstory. A month ago, I moved out of my old apartment and into a small house in Brimstone County. The place was super cheap, and now I think I know why, but we’ll get to that. For now, I’ll start at the very beginning. \n\nWhen I was first looking around at the open house, the Eyes should probably have set me off first. They were everywhere, in every reflective surface, just a… something, that was watching me from behind. They showed up in mirrors, windows, even the newly cleaned countertops. But I always just chalked it up to my own imagination and paranoia. I mean, it is called Brimstone County, after all. Of course I might have some subconscious doubts about it.\n\nSo, even after that, I bought the house. Now, I don’t question the Eyes. They’re just another odd thing about this place. In fact, the eyes are one of the more tame creatures. Right after I moved in, I started to notice a few other strange things. \n\nFor one, the school mascot was a damn Wendigo, of all things. There also seemed to be this unspoken rule about never going into this one section of the woods… I think people were calling it the Lincolnwood? It never made sense to me. Still doesn’t, to be honest. There’s a stretch of road that goes around the Lincolnwood, and apparently cars always break down if they get too close.\n\nAnyway, into the real story. A few days after I moved in, I was in a small grocery market trying to find something to eat that wasn’t either some knockoff garbage food or mutated-looking plants. There were a few other people there, but it wasn’t a huge store. You could probably walk from one side to the other in less than half a minute even if you were going at a leisurely pace.\n\nThere was another person in the aisle next to me, an elderly woman whose name I didn’t know. I still don’t, but it doesn’t matter much now. She came up to me and asked me to watch her cart, as she had some important call that she needed to take, and I obliged without thinking too much of it. A few minutes later, I heard her collapse to the floor, sobbing.\n\nA few other people from nearby ran over to see what was happening. One of them, said his name was Xavier, started asking me questions about what had happened before, what had I been doing, things like that. When I finished explaining, he just nodded and asked me to wait there. I got the sense he knew a lot more about the situation then he was letting on, but I didn’t want to pry, so I just did what he told me to.\n\nI think someone must have called the police at some point, because they showed up later and said they were taking the older woman for some kind of questioning, probably about what happened. The situation certainly seemed bad, but I didn’t see the need for police involvement. Not at the time.\n\nAs they were taking the woman outside, she kept screaming about how she “told him not to go back in the woods” and that she “had known it would find him eventually.” Needless to say, I was more than a bit disturbed by this. Everyone still inside the store slowly went back to shopping, but there was a layer of hushed whispers hiding under the silence that now lay heavy on all of us. \n\nThere were rumors for the next week that some male figure in her life, be it father, brother, or son, had entered the Lincolnwood and need killed by… something. The only thing everyone knew for sure was that when the missing posters went up a few days later, nobody would ever see the man whose face lie on them again.\n\nThen there was the murder. Well, the word “murder” implies it was done by a human. I guess “death” would be more accurate. Everyone on my street awoke to the sound of agonized screams coming from the house at the end of the road. It was a small branch of the main town, so we were likely the only ones that heard it, but that was hard to believe at the time. They were so loud that it makes my eardrums hurt just thinking about it.\n\nYet again, the police were called, and as it turns out, that house belonged to the same woman that had broken down in the grocery store. I really don’t want to describe what they found.\n\nWe saw on the local news the next morning that they had come to the house to find the front door had been busted open so hard that the metal frame was bent. All the windows had broken as well, but it looked like they had been smashed from the outside, as all the glass shards coated the floor. They had found the body in the middle of the floor, laying in a position that made it seem like she had just been standing there and then had suddenly dropped dead.\n\nApparently, there was no clear reason for her death either. It really was as though she had been perfectly healthy, and then her heart just… stopped. I just can’t shake this feeling that there’s more to this story that I don’t know. \n\nBy know im sure you want to know why I don’t just leave. The truth is, I don’t think I can. I’ve tried, yes. I tried driving, walking, even trying to fly a drone outside often county borders. It’s just not possible. I always get lost or turned around, and I end up right back in the middle of town, even in ways that shouldn’t be possible. Whatever this place is, whatever it wants… for now, I just have to play along.",

        "text": "This is a story which happened to me and my friend a few years back. I work in a national park as a park ranger. When my life was relatively normal, I had just landed a job at a national park, life was good as I was working with my buddy Rob.\n\n  The second day was… Strange. We found bear traps on the ground, we never put them there. Other than that, another day in paradise, but throughout the night, I swear I heard a loud screech coming from the woods near my watch tower, I looked and saw nothing. I just shrugged it off after a little while.\n\n   As of lately we have been finding small animal corpses around the woods, this is normal since we have bears all over, it’s just that these marks were too big to belong to a bear. What's even weirder is we found a tooth inside of a bloody deer, this tooth was too huge and sharp to belong to a bear, I think we have a new animal in these woods.\n\n  Today we found a bear, hanging from a tree and gutted, I nearly threw up. No animal in the park could do this. Boss told us from now on to stay at the watchtowers. I kept being reassured that everything would be fine, but at this point I just couldn’t be too sure anymore.\n\n  Lately the screeches have been more frequent, I’m having trouble focusing. When I was younger, I was told of a creature that fed off people and animals, it could also mimic voices. It was called a Wendigo, of course I don’t believe in that paranormal crap but, something was taking out animals throughout the park.\n\n I swear I heard Rob call me from outside of my watchtower. He yelled “Hey Trent you have got to come see this!” I nearly left, but I just felt that his voice was off, nearly distorted. I looked out of my watch tower, to see Rob, his insides dangling in the breeze. My boss ruled this out as an accident, that still didn’t stop the police from questioning me, I know I heard his voice!\n\n  I saw something in the woods. Let me explain. This creature I saw had huge antlers, an animal skull as a mask and it was over 11 feet tall! The night began normally, until the screeches began again! I looked down, only to see this creature, eating my boss's lifeless body. I got a good look at it before it ran off and out of sight.\n\n  The police have been very suspicious of me lately, how could they not be? Both of the people I worked with are dead. I tried to explain what I saw to the police, of course nobody believed me. It all led to me being terminated.\n\n I’ve decided I’m not going to let this creature ruin my life. I have done research on this \"Wendigo\". I plan to break into the park tonight. I will end this, I must,\n\n   I’m in the park, I hear the screeches and I am following them. I hear the voices of my boss and Rob. They are telling me that they are ok and I should come meet them by my watchtower. I know from my research that the Wendigo creature is really good at tricking people.\n\nI just kept wandering around the park. I was wondering, until I heard my mothers voice, she died when I was six. My instincts told me no, but I had missed her so much. “Don’t worry mom, I’m coming!”",

        "text": "Week 3–5\n\nIt’s been almost a month since my last visit to that damned trail. Since my last attack. My newly found friends, the ones dangerously addicted to the supernatural stuff, convinced me to eventually return. At least one last time. They provided a sensible reason too.\n\nSo, that night when I left my home, the following morning and for the past three weeks, I have been waking up with welts and dark black bruises on my arms, legs, and face. It’s like I have an illness of some sort. Randomly, out of the blue. Not to mention, I’ve also developed consistent night terrors. Every night, for the past three weeks. I’ll wake up in cold sweats between the hours of 2:00 am and 3:00 am. It’s spot on every night. The same nightmare. I’m being dragged down that trail by an almost translucent creature. There’s an outline in front of me, as I’m being dragged. It’s sharp and spikey. If the color was full, it would for sure be jet black. The outline of this thing was humanoid, but the way that it moved was proof that it was far from human. My body feels like it’s burning &amp; I can’t move. I’m not tied or bound. I just cannot move. This creature is making sounds as it’s dragging me. Gurgling and growling I think. It sounds like it’s hungry or angry. Hangry maybe? I know it’s not the time to be funny, but I could use a laugh right now. Considering my current situation.\n\nMy friends tell me that these “night terrors” are demonic attacks. Like getting in a fight, but just on the spiritual plane. Or something weird like that. I’m not completely sure. Not sure that I’ll ever be able to believe in or understand such things. They’re interesting, to say the least. So, according to my friends, if I want these horrible things to stop, I have to return to that trail. Where it all began. I have to face whatever this thing is and demand it to stop. Command it to leave me. This is the sensible reason to return. Apparently. But, then again, look at what I’m dealing with. What choice do I have? All of this is just impossible. Ridiculous.\n\nMy friends have shared with me that they are indeed paranormal enthusiasts. Which, was quite obvious. One of them has been studying paranormal investigation techniques and the science behind it all. The other two have been studying demonology and how to cleanse people of negative energies. In some cases, actual demons. Like living beings that latch to you and deliberately try to harm you and those around you. It’s crazy talk! But, every morning is a solid reminder that the crazy is indeed real. It’s happening to me and affecting my physical body. Ultimately, my friends are considering creating a local paranormal team. Their primary goals would be to gather evidence that the supernatural world exists and to help those in need from what is considered spiritual oppression. Even full-blown possession. Like what you see in the movies apparently. They’ve offered me a spot on their future team, as a researcher and investigator. They said, with my personal experience and open, yet logical mind, we could make a pretty amazing team. They make a good point and I feel honored, but I don’t feel ready. Not yet. I don’t feel that I believe in it enough, or care. Plus, if this paranormal ghost-haunting stuff turns out to be real after all, I’m going to need some time away from it. Seriously.\n\nAlong with all of this to consider, they have provided me with a very detailed breakdown of what I seriously need to consider doing. That is if I want to end this impossible nightmare of course. They have taken the liberty to do a lot of research on the local area. Anything and everything that you could think of. Their research included ghost stories, tragedies, murders, assaults, kidnappings, cults, witchcraft, and so on. Nothing came back with positive results. Now, even though nothing showed up from their research, that doesn’t mean that nothing has ever happened. Or recently happened. This just means that something may not have been discovered or written about yet. What is being considered right now is that there could have recently been a murder or possibly some form of a dark ritual. My friends keep going back and forth between these two possibilities the most. I mean, they make sense. It’s not like a ghost attack can happen out of nowhere for no reason. Right?\n\nI’m going to “stoop” to their level for a moment. Perhaps I’ve had an attachment all of my life. Maybe I’ve only had this alleged attachment for the past five or ten years. Or, according to them, a real classic reason for a haunted location or person is disturbing a grave site. Moreso, a Native American burial ground. Also known as sacred or cursed land. That’s depending on who you are and your intentions of course. But, I wasn’t being disrespectful or disturbing anything. For the past three years, I have run that trail, and I have done no such thing. I have no clue, but it’s possible I guess. From what the guys have been sharing with me lately, these are some other possibilities to consider. The research they’re doing is extensive. I thought college was bad. The tunnel ahead of me looks dark and endless. With no answers to be found. But why now? Why all of a sudden is this thing making itself known to me? Why is it attacking me? Why did this all start at that specific park? Why on the Abbaduk Trail? Why in the form of screams? Why did it start at 8:00 pm and not 3:00 am? The infamous “Witching Hour” that I’m hearing so much about. So many damned questions and sadly no answers. Not yet. But, the more I think about it, the more I want to know.\n\nOver time I’ve become less and less fearful. I’ve made praying a daily and nightly routine, being that it’s the only weapon I know to use in such a scenario. What else can I do? What I’ve noticed, is the more I pray and the more I believe in the power of my prayer, the less often and the less severe my attacks have become. It seems to be working. Like actually working. So, I guess it won’t hurt to keep doing it. My friends also have encouraged me to keep praying. Anything positive and filled with good intentions can break down a negative being or force. They’ve been praying with me as well. Between the three of them, they all have been allowing me to stay at their homes throughout this entire process. Talk about being lucky. I can’t be alone right now and I need as much guidance as possible on what to do to stop this.\n\nWe haven’t visited the actual location since we all met. It’s been more or less a time of preparing. What we are preparing for is to conduct an investigation and then an actual deliverance. The deliverance is to be done on me and the land. We are going to return to that exact spot on that exact trail and investigate the surrounding areas. Perhaps we’ll find something that will indicate what this thing is and why it’s chosen to attack me. We’re planning on going tomorrow evening. We’re going to start the investigation during the day. Starting during the day will help us get a better understanding of our surroundings. It’s also so that we may sweep the area thoroughly. To see if we can find anything out of the ordinary that could tell us what this thing is and why it’s there. The guys seem excited but also determined to help me end this. I feel excited too, but my excitement is to find some answers. I’m not exactly excited to face this thing head-on. Especially not in its own backyard. So much could go wrong. I know I’ll be in a group, but there’s this feeling in my gut that’s telling me not to go. Fear, I guess.\n\nAlso, I don’t know what’s going to happen. The unknown is my worst enemy. Will all of this finally end? Or will it only get worse once we start fighting back? On the other hand, I do feel safer. I have a support system now. My support system seems strong and able. I’m no longer alone and I’m more ready to fight than I’ve ever been. I’m so tired though. This exhaustion has become my fuel to fight. An unexpected transition for sure. I’m just done. But, I’m ready. I have to be.\n\nWeek 3–5: Night 1\n\nTonight’s the night! We’re putting a stop to this demonic attachment crap! I’m going to sleep in my own bed tonight! After all of this insanity is said and done. And I will not be sharing my bed with any uninvited guests anymore. I still woke up with my typical welts and bruises. This time, they weren’t as bad though. The prayers seem to be working their magic. Good magic mind you. The nightmare didn’t occur this time either. Instead, I had a dream about war. It wasn’t super vivid, but the sensation and emotions attached to my dream felt very real and personal. There were battles taking place. Lots of screaming and anger. Specifically, I heard the screams from the woods. I didn’t feel scared or in trouble. I felt victorious and powerful. I felt alive. The screams got louder over time and tried to tear me down. But, it couldn’t. I was able to scream back and prayed right after. Then, there was a blast of white light and I woke up. My heart was pounding and I was sweating pretty badly. But, I didn’t feel helpless or like I was about to be beaten to death. It was different this time. I have no idea why or how, but it was different. A good kind of different.\n\nThe time is 5:15 pm. My friends and I went over the plan one last time. We grabbed our gear, made sure all devices were charged and accounted for, grabbed a bite to eat, and loaded the vehicle. We arrived at the park just a little past 6:00 pm. The guys asked me to show them where I heard the screams and ultimately where my attacks first started.\n\nWe didn’t grab any gear other than some flashlights. For when it got dark. We walked the trail to the spot in question and began to search the surrounding woods. This was the first time I’d been back in about a month. And for the first time in a long time, there was no screaming. There were people there too. There were families having picnics and children playing on the playground. Runners tackling the Abbaduk Trail as I used to. With no worry in the world. There were so many people and I loved that so much. I almost felt like things were back to normal. But, I knew better. They weren’t. Once we arrived at the spot, two of the guys went left off the path into the woods, while I and my other friend took the right side. The plan covered what we were looking for. Anything that shouldn’t be there. These things included clothing, money, bottles, figurines, or any trace of a human being.\n\nThe first step was to rule out any sign of a murder scene. The second step was to rule out any sign of possible witchcraft or ritual activity. And the third step was to respectfully search the area for any signs of burial grounds or lost communities. If any of these scenarios could be ruled out, then it would seem that this thing has been with me a lot longer than originally thought. We searched for hours and came up with nothing. This honestly disappointed me beyond belief. I started to feel depressed, which quickly turned to fear. Not that I wanted anything bad to have happened to someone, but I wanted to find an answer. The answer, to what this thing is and why it’s terrorizing me. Finding the answer seemed to only become more complicated and less likely as time went on.\n\nI’m tired, I’m scared, I’m confused, and I’m lost. What am I going to do? If this thing is connected to a family member from years ago, where do I even start? Do I have enough sanity to keep looking? To keep trying to get rid of this thing? Again, I’m done. I’m just so tired of looking for answers and constantly being attacked by some freak of nature. And for no damn reason. Not a good reason at least. Is this thing natural? Can I even consider it that? No. It’s not. I’m just losing my mind and I don’t know what else to do.\n\nIt’s now 8:15 pm. The guys and I are done searching the grounds. It’s too dark now. Even in the light, we weren’t able to find anything. Maybe the area was cleaned up. Maybe some animals came by and ransacked the area that we were searching. Years before our search today. Either way, it was dark and it was that time of the night. It was time to fight. The trail had become quiet and still. No more people. The four of us had met back in the middle of the trail and sat down in a circle. Back to back. No gear. This part of the plan was to observe the area of interest naturally. Using only our senses. Honestly, we were doing what I did the first two times that I encountered the screams. Nothing. All we did was exist and listen. To my absolute shock, there was no screaming. Absolutely nothing. Some obvious wildlife sounds and nighttime bugs chirping, but nothing unusual or “paranormal.”\n\nThis pissed me off! The one time that I finally had people with me, a support system, and this thing decides not to show up. All of a sudden it doesn’t want to show its ass? No! I don’t think so, it’s going to show. One way or the other. I will make it show itself. I am not leaving tonight without forcing this thing to leave me and go back to where it came from! I’ve been going through hell for far too long and for no good reason. I’m not perfect, but I’m not a killer or some kind of demented narcissist. I live my life and try to not cause any waves in the matrix. This thing has to go. It can’t stay. I have to do something.\n\nTwo whole hours go by and nothing has happened. Something had to be done. So, I did something. I got up from our four-man circle and started calling out to the thing. Challenging it and highlighting what a coward it is. I told it that it’s proven to me that it’s weak. It obviously can’t do what it’s been doing for the past month because of my prayers and the support of my friends. It’s a coward and a weak pathetic creature. I didn’t offer my energy like how some of those “professional” investigators do sometimes. But, I did call it some pretty nasty names. My friends had me binge-watch some reality ghost shows for the past few weeks. A tax to pay for staying at their homes I suppose. It wasn’t terrible. Sometimes they were creepy and at other times they were amusing. But, the real reason for watching was for me to learn some of the basic “Dos and Don’ts” when dealing with the supernatural.\n\nAfter calling the thing out for several minutes, nothing happened. Not exactly what I was expecting. A slight breeze ran down the trail, almost bringing a sign of peace with it. For the first time, I was angry and unnerved by the sheer silence. Something I have been begging for. I almost craved for the screams to come rolling down the trail. Almost prayed for them to come.\n\nThe time was roughly 10:30 pm. Fifteen minutes since my mini meltdown. We decided as a group that two of us should return to the vehicle now and grab the equipment. It was time for us to increase our efforts in search of anything “unnatural.” The other two, with me being one of the two, will stay back and continue to observe the environment without any equipment. Perhaps having fewer people around will provide different results. Maybe the cowardly ghost will show itself finally. This is a common method that paranormal investigators use in the field. Smaller groups. Why it works so well, I have no clue. But, it can be dangerous and result in terrifying results. Maybe the ghostly beings are shy. Perhaps too many humans being in one place at one time blocks their energy. Or limits the extent of their abilities. Just another theory that ghost hunters are seeking a solid answer on.\n\nAs our two friends got further and further away from our initial spot, I felt a change in the air. Like we were being watched or about to be approached by someone. Maybe just being in the dark woods with fewer people around was giving me the heebie-jeebies. Regardless of the reason, I started feeling uneasy for sure. As the other two disappeared around the trail’s bend about 150 ft. away, the show finally began. Almost instantly, rocks and pinecones started pelting me and my friend. Coming out of the thicket to our right. Hitting us in the head and the neck. Whoever or whatever was throwing these objects at us, had perfect aim. Especially for being in the pitch-dark woods with no lights. We jumped up instantly and backed away by at least 15 ft. The objects suddenly stopped being thrown.\n\nThankfully, we had our high-lumen flashlights on us and we flooded the nearby brush. Together, we ran into the brush and out to a clearing that we had found and searched earlier. There was no one around. Not even any animals. At this point, we noticed something odd. All of the natural sounds of the night had stopped. Even the bugs had stopped chirping. It was really weird, now that I come to think about it. As my friend and I searched the area, we noticed a pile of medium-sized rocks and five lines of pinecones neatly placed in the center of the clearing. We had searched this exact area from top to bottom earlier. There was nothing like this here before. We would’ve noticed without a doubt. This was terrifying, and running straight into the woods at night was such a stupid idea. But, at least I wasn’t alone. That helped.\n\nI started walking toward the pile of rocks and the lines of pinecones. I bent down to touch them. Just to inspect them a little further. But, right before I could touch them, the rocks and pinecones blew away before my very eyes. Like there was someone below me scattering everything away in all directions. Making an absolute mess. But, there wasn’t anything below me, and the classic wind theory was out of the window. We were surrounded by brush and there was no wind of any kind. The rocks and the pinecones just flew off the ground in multiple directions. It was horrifying to say the least! Seeing and hearing such a phenomenon happen was not right. It was unnatural. This was for sure unnatural. Yet it was happening. There was nothing physically there to make it happen. The next thing I knew, our flashlights went out. Both of them at the same time. Somehow these brand new batteries died within minutes of being used. It didn’t make sense to me. How? Everything went black. No sounds. No light. No life. Then it happened. The screams. The screams finally returned.\n\nThat shrill blood-curdling scream quickly filled the clearing that we were in. It was zipping around us like there was a surround sound system or something. The way that the sound of the screaming traveled was inhuman. There was no way that a human could move around like that. No way at all! My friend started screaming. I could faintly hear him over the unnatural screams, but I could tell that there was a second scream now. A man’s scream. His screaming was further away than it should have been. Did he try to run away? Am I all alone now? Stuck in the pitch-black woods and surrounded by something evil? I felt hopeless and was petrified! The overwhelming feeling of goosebumps ripping through my body quickly came back. My eyes were full of burning tears. It was terrible. Being attacked and disabled at the same time. I fell to my knees, covered my ears, and started praying. I prayed for forgiveness for when I taunted the “spirit” and I prayed for protection over my friend and me. I kept praying, but I could still hear the screams of that thing raging around me.\n\nAt some point, I felt a cold sharp pain start at my mid-back and slowly crawl up to the back of my neck. It felt sharp, like a knife. It also had a tingling sensation to it, like a low-voltage taser or some kind of electrical instrument. The touch itself didn’t hurt, but the intention felt invasive and threatening. At this point, I freaked out! I screamed out loud, “Get the hell off of me and leave us alone!” “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ! Leave!” Almost instantly, the touch sensation evaporated away, the screaming repelled deep into the woods, and our flashlights started to flicker until becoming a constant ray of light again. It went silent. No more screaming. Thank God.\n\nI found my friend behind me. About 30 ft. away from me. I was shocked to see him that far. How’d he get there? Fear and luck? Panic and instinct? Something didn't seem right. He was lying in the fetal position by a large tree, crying and shaking. I ran over to him and picked him up. I comforted him and told him it was ok now, but that we had to move. We needed to at least get back out on the open trail. This way, we could stand our ground a bit easier and be ready for our friends to return. As I shouldered my friend and we began walking back toward the trail, I noticed he was limping. I also noticed that he had several red slash marks on his neck. Blood was drawn to the surface of his skin, but thankfully no open wounds. I waited until we got back on the trail to ask him what had happened after our lights went out. Once we broke through the tree line, we huddled in the center of the trail and kept our lights on. We consistently flashed the surrounding areas with our lights. Like police officers in a squad car searching for a perp. Everything was still. Everything was silent. A moment to breathe and think. I kept thanking God for that. I turned to my friend and asked what happened to him. He began shaking and rocking in place. He stared off into the woods as he told me what happened, and why he believes it did.\n\nRight after the lights went out, he recalled feeling a similar sharp tingling sensation. Right away. But, the sensation went from his mid-back and down his left leg. Finally, the sensation seemed to wrap around his ankle. He then proceeded to tell me that a tight pressure formed around his ankle and that a sudden twist made him fall on his back. The twist made him yelp in pain. He said that it felt like someone had taken two hammers and smacked both sides of his ankle bone. That they smacked both hammers together at the same time. He said that the pain was so terrible, he believes that he blacked out for a moment. The next thing that he remembers after he came to, was that his left leg was elevated and he was being dragged away from me. He was being dragged off to a nearby tree where he was strung upside down. He swore to me that he was lifted mid-air against that tree. That’s when he began screaming uncontrollably. When I heard him screaming from afar. He said, as he was being suspended upside down, something began to claw at his neck. Over and over and over. Like a cat or a raccoon trying to desperately escape after being cornered. That’s what it felt like to him anyway. What seemed like a lifetime suddenly stopped, and he fell to the ground below the tree. Thankfully, he was not severely hurt during the fall. The next thing he knew, I was picking him up and we were getting out of there.\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was truly thankful that it didn’t get that far with me. Thankfully it didn’t choose to do that to me first. But, I couldn’t help but wonder why. Then he told me why. He said that he was taunting and threatening whatever spirits were around us. Telling them to leave me alone and mess with him instead. He admitted that he went as far as offering up his own energy to whatever was around us. He told it that he was stronger and that it had no control over him. Even with the offering of his spiritual energy. That he was simply more powerful than it was. He also admitted to me, how wrong he was and that he planned on never doing such things again. God willing. I told him that it was ok and that we all have learning curves. We just need to pick a new strategy for when we plan on taking this thing on again. A safer one too.\n\nAbout twenty minutes pass by and our friends finally return with all of our gear. They clearly saw the distraught looks on our faces and asked what had happened. We filled them in on everything. Their response was as expected. Hanging jaws and wide-eyed expressions. They immediately evaluated the area and then us. These were the two friends that were studying demonology. Why we didn’t have one of them stay with us, I have no idea. Lesson learned for sure. Perhaps everything happened the way it was supposed to. So that we’d receive the results that we did. This encounter was needed. Perhaps even planned. By a higher power maybe? But why? It seemed so cruel and dangerous. Maybe there’s a bigger picture to it all that none of us see yet. I don’t know.\n\nAfter checking the area and making sure we were ok, they cleansed us. Something they had not done before, because they didn’t feel ready or confident enough that they could. But, seeing the fear on our faces seemed to have done something to them. It changed them. They became almost like our personal bodyguards. Doing their best to save their friends seemed to become a top priority over everything else. Especially self-criticism. Once we were taken care of, we checked our gear and set everything up in a small circular radius on the trail. These guys have been preparing for a while. Night vision cameras, EMF detectors, DVRs for EVP sessions, traditional battery and laser grid motion detectors, AM/FM radios for high and low-frequency sweeping, and so much more. These guys were ready. Tonight wasn’t just an investigation, it was a fight. A battle. Perhaps that’s what my dream was about. What’s that weird thing called when people have an insight into the future? A premonition!\n\nI’m still on the fence about believing in this stuff, but who knows? These guys were willing to help me get rid of this invisible thing. Whatever it took and however long it takes. I wanted to cry after seeing how devoted and willing they were to help me. I felt like there was hope and that this nightmare was going to end. Suddenly, I didn’t feel forsaken or stuck. As we got everything in place and switched on, we decided that two of us should stay back within the equipment circle, to prevent any theft or outside interference. While the other two go back inside the brush to that clearing. The area that’s been made pretty obvious this thing likes to thrive in. That clearing seems extremely important to this “specter.” I volunteered to go back in with one of our demonologists. I wanted it to be me. It needed to be me. I wanted to be the last thing that this bastard saw before we sent it back to whatever dark hole it crawled out of. Plus, my ankle wasn’t sprained. I also wasn’t as traumatized from the most recent attack. It was only right that I went.\n\nJust as we started to break through the tree line, we heard something in the distance. It was very faint. But, it was growing louder the longer we listened. As the sound got louder, it was clear that it was getting closer. Then I recognized what it was. It was that terrible crashing sound that I heard at the entrance of the park, and it was coming directly toward us. A freight train from hell. Like the screaming, this sound was unnatural. It didn’t sound like a normal train derailing. It was garbled and looping. The longer I listened, it started to sound like a large animal breathing heavily and stampeding in our direction. Whatever it was, it was enough to produce ripples of goosebumps throughout my body again. I started to tear up again too. Just like before. This thing was causing so much discomfort and fear. My body just reacted naturally to this unnatural thing. It was insane. It wasn’t right. Stuff like this isn’t supposed to be real.\n\nMy torment seems to be endless at this point. And I’ve managed to bring three poor souls along with me. They didn’t deserve this any more than I did. They didn’t deserve this at all. They’re just good people trying to help someone in need. Clearly, this thing didn’t care. It simply added them to the list. Whether we were ready or not, shit was about to get real. And it was about to get a lot worse. Worse than any of us could have ever imagined.",

        "text": "To give some backstory before everything happened, yes I was a part of a cult. The cult from what I knew, never had live sacrifices. They’d burn food and what not for their ‘God’ but that was it. Looking back on it now, they probably did have live sacrifices. I joined the cult because a few friends I had met in college were a part of it. After hearing them talk about it, I thought the cult wasn’t so bad. I was dead wrong, but it was too late by the time I found that out.\n\nI am ashamed I was even a part of the cult, but at that time in my life, I was in a terrible head-space and wanted a place I could lean on and confide in. The cult offered just that for me. They listened to my problems and offered their support. They didn’t judge me for things I did and things I experienced; instead they told me their ‘*God’* would help me. At first, I wasn’t really there for belief in their *‘God*’, but after a while, I began praying to it and I did start feeling better mentally. \n\nI was part of the cult for almost a year and I never noticed anything off. I should’ve paid more attention; who knows how many people were sacrificed in the name of their ‘God’. The guilt from that still clings to me to this day. Anyways, sorry for dragging this on, but I wanted everyone to get a clear understanding about how I became part of the cult. It all happened on the night of a lunar eclipse in 2015. \n\nEarlier that day, I was messaged by one of my friends that was a part of the cult to come later than usual. I was curious as to why they wanted me to come later, but I figured maybe it was a surprise birthday party. Stupid, I know, but the cult made a point to celebrate birthdays. So like my friend said, I arrived at the place the cult met later than what I normally did. When I walked through the doors, a bag was placed over my head.\n\nThis naturally startled me until I heard my friend say, “It’s just me, I’m taking you to the other room.”\n\nI just thought that they really wanted to keep it a surprise so I didn’t resist. I only started getting nervous and scared when I began hearing the chants from the cult members. They only recited those chants when they offered up their food as homage to their ‘God’. Naturally I had asked my friend what was going on, but they were silent. I resisted against them but other hands grabbed me.\n\nI screamed and screamed and moved however I could, but it was no use. It wasn’t long before they had me upon a table with ropes tied to my arms and legs. Regardless of that, I still tried to move. The chanting quieted down and the cult leader’s voice rang out, “Brothers and Sisters! What a blessed night for us! This poor lost lamb will be the final sacrifice to release our lord from his imprisonment!”\n\nCheers erupted from the other members as the bag from my head was removed.\n\nI stared up at the cult leader’s face in fear. His smile seemed so genuine despite him holding a dagger in his hand.\n\n“Please, why are you doing this? Why me?” I asked.\n\nHe patted my head, “Lost lamb, our lord has done so much for you, it is time to repay his kindness. Our lord has chosen you to be his final sacrifice, you should rejoice!”\n\nTears built in my eyes, nothing I said would convince them otherwise. After my silence, he motioned to the members and they began their chants once more. I cried and struggled against my confines more, cutting into my flesh to try to escape. The cult leader walked to the fire in the center of the room and placed the dagger’s blade in it. He began chanting as well. \n\nHe walked back to me, “Lord we offer this lost lamb to you! May you accept this sacrifice and be released from your chains!”\n\nAs soon as he said those words, he plunged the dagger into my chest. The pain was horrible but quick. I felt myself grow cold as my vision blackened. *Why? Why me? How could this happen? I don’t want to die! Please! Someone! Something! Save me!* These thoughts rushed through my mind, not expecting an answer in return,\n\n“***Poor lost lamb, I shall grant you what you wish for***”\n\nNext thing I knew, I was waking up on that table, no longer bound by rope. I sat up and looked at the horrible sight around me. All of the cult members were dead. I looked down at my chest and noticed that there was no wound where the dagger was, just blood that coated my shirt and skin. \n\nNaturally, I was taken aback by this, I mean, I should be dead, but here I am. It was then that I felt a faint presence inside me. A presence that resembled the one that I felt before I *‘died’*. Was this the *‘God’* the cult spoke of? The presence felt dark and sinister; it made me sick. Once I found my legs, I stumbled back to my apartment in a daze. \n\nI refused to go outside for weeks; I couldn’t trust anybody and I was scared of what had taken residence in my body. I drove myself crazy trying to search for the identity of the being the cult worshiped, but I couldn’t find anything. It wasn’t until my brother showed up at my apartment, worried to death, that I decided to try and forget about the presence and what it was. But, that was easier said than done. No matter what I did, I felt its presence observing me and the outside world. \n\nIt almost felt as if it was trying to understand the world around it before it made its move. Not to mention, no matter what happens, I never get hurt or sick. I was involved in a car crash in 2018 where I should’ve died, but I was alive without a scratch on me. Later on, in 2019, I was mugged at gunpoint. The person who mugged me went to take off across the road and was hit by a truck that came out of nowhere. \n\nI know some of you might think it was just a coincidence that the mugger was hit by a vehicle, but I’m positive it was the presence that caused it to happen. After that, I cut contact from most people except for my mom and brother. Thankfully, nothing had happened to them. For whatever reason, it is ensuring that I’m not harmed in any way. Anyways after the mugging incident, I began researching it once more. \n\nI searched scriptures of ancient civilizations, delved into mythology and religion, and even talked with theologians and mythologists. The only thing those experts and I found was a tablet that spoke of an ancient being sealed over a millennia ago. Since then, I’ve been searching even more diligently about this being since it is the closest thing to this ‘God’ the cult had worshiped. \n\nWhatever this thing is, I think I became its vessel when I was sacrificed. My research has come to a stalemate as of recently, there is nothing left for me to dig into. That is why I'm here, if any of you have any information concerning this, I’d love to hear it. I do feel guilty, however, because even as I’m writing this, I can feel it observing me and what I’m doing. I have no idea if it’ll do something or if it can do something, but I can’t continue on in constant fear like this.\n\nAgain, if you have information, no matter how small, please tell me. I, at the very least, want to know what this presence, this ‘God’ is. Especially since it has not revealed itself to me at all, even in a dream. I guess I would also like to add, don’t trust people blindly, you may end up in horrible situations. After all, this all started because I met some ‘friends’ in college.",

        "text": " \n\n467 B.C. - The sun was setting upon *“inkwi”*, an island once located near the Caribbean … \n\nI don’t remember the exact date as to when it all took place , but if I recall correctly I believe I was 7 years old and I was hunting with Araf , my father . We were out at sunrise hunting deer and small birds. My father was an expert in the art of hunting unlike me who ran aimlessly in hopes of catching a stupid bird . By the time dusk set in , we started to gather all our hunting equipment in order to return to our little cabin in the center of town . On our way back through the dense forest , filled with trees with orange and yellow leaves and small critters looking for their next meal , I looked straight up ,  and in the midst of all that orange ,  I could see black and purple dots scattered across the sky .\n\nThis went on for the next  5 years , each year the dots grew bigger in size  and unlike my first encounter with them where they all seemed so distant from one another , with each passing day they seemed to unite with each other , their presence becoming stronger and more threatening .\n\n468 B.C. - It wasn’t only the particles anymore , it was the soft heartbeat sounds that could be heard each time a particle grew larger in size or connected to another one. By this point , everyone was talking about the strange phenomenon that had invaded our little island and demanding answers from our town counselors such as my father . It didn’t take much longer until the fear and hatred started to consume my neighbors , as the particles had reached a point where parts of the sun were being completely blocked during parts of the day and there were still no answers .  Many of our neighbors started throwing rocks at our windows and many of the town kids would beat me up whenever they saw me leave the house . It got to a point where enough was enough and my father called everyone in for a town meeting in which he stated the reality we were all facing and how at this rate we should prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario : total darkness. \n\nAfter that day , we couldn’t manage to leave our house anymore , as the threat of our entire family being hanged or burned alive by our neighbors was always present.\n\n470 B.C. - No one was getting sleep anymore , the noises kept intensifying and our biggest fears were  starting to turn into a reality . The particles had now blocked nearly the entire \n\nSky and we could now clearly see the formation of a black hole surrounded in its entirety by a flashing purple glow. I was fascinated by the imposing behemoth and would spend hours just looking at it ,imagining all the possibilities as to what it may contain and why it came to visit our little town .\n\nLittle did I know that it wouldn’t take long until I found the answers to all my questions…\n\n472 B.C. - I was sitting on the front porch of our little cabin when it all went down …\n\nThe black hole started spinning at a speed never seen before ! During this stage , a gust of wind ferociously attacked our side of town , yanking the branches off nearby trees and carrying all sorts of sharp debris along with it. I covered my face with my hands , trying to grab something to hold onto and then suddenly , a loud explosion could be heard from the “eye” of the void ! I screamed in terror  and quickly jumped to my feet! \n\nI yanked the door open and screamed for everyone to abandon the house immediately , my parents grabbed our siblings by the arms and rushed them out of the cabin. I looked to my sides and could see dozens of my neighbors exiting their homes , some were running to the mountains and others were trying to find a place to hide , but we went straight for the woods…\n\nWe ran for a long time while constantly hearing a hoard of footsteps trailing behind us , they were catching up . I knew we could only keep this up for so long until they would finally find us but I didn’t care . My mind was so concentrated on escaping that I was startled when I heard my mothers scream in the distance. I took a glance behind me but I couldn’t see anything. The only thing I could hear was a loud explosion nearby ,followed by a dreadful moment of silence . I stopped dead in my tracks as the realization that my family was gone hit me . I fell to the ground , ripped my shirt apart and started to cry inconsolably. I layed in the dirt for a long time until I heard the sound of footsteps quickly approaching…\n\n I JOLTED STRAIGHT UP AND MADE A RUN FOR IT , DASHING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS THE TREES , JUMPING AND DUCKING ACROSS THEM . I RAN AND RaN UNtiL mY LeGS fInAlly GaVE OuT AnD EVERything WEnt BLacK…\n\nI don’t know how much time had passed until I woke up ,  but when I did , I realized I was far from home , somewhere foreign. The terrain was purplish and very rocky and an odd smell emanated from something nearby. Once I stood up I found where it was coming from.\n\nThey were completely black , had purple glowing eyes and a ton of spikes from the top of their head all the way to their tails , they are known as the “Eliotropi”. They grabbed me by the arms and led me down a long trail filled with sharp alien rocks and gross parasites and alien bird-like creatures that inhabited the area . After a long and painful walk we finally made it to our destination …\n\nA massive palace-like structure , black and purple were its colors . I looked to my sides and could see spaceships landing all around me . They opened their doors and I was shocked to see kids just like me, some looked younger, some looked older , but none of them were adults . The Eliotropi stopped me at the steps of the palace and I waited as the kids from the other spaceships arrived at the palace steps . When everyone had finally made it there , I took a glance behind me and I saw hundreds of kids piled up with one another , some were crying but most of them were in complete shock, not yet having processed the reality of their situation  . We climbed up the stairs until I came face to face with a giant red metal door. When it opened I was completely blinded by the darkness of the room . All I could hear were the words of the Eliotropi :\n\n———————————————————————————————————————\n\nEliotropi 1 : “ General X, the invasion on Earth was a success ! We have bought what you have demanded of us.”\n\nGeneral X \\*laughs\\* “How delightful… Don’t waste anymore time and proceed to give them all to the people!”\n\nEliotropi 2 “ Finally , I've been hungry for a while ! ”\n\nGeneral X “ Yes , Yes , calm down! Before you leave, do me a favor and separate a couple of them from the group and bring them to me . I think it's about time …”\n\n———————————————————————————————————————-\n\nSuddenly two groups were made , most of the kids were piled into one group but I was placed into a much smaller group of about 20 kids . I looked to my left and my right in fear  as I saw two doors emerge from the walls , they slowly opened , and we were taken in .\n\nWe walked down a long corridor until we came across another door . This one was completely golden and had purple cracks all around it . I went in and I was finally able to see him ! Sitting in the throne was General X , he wore a neo-samurai helmet and a tattered cape along his back . He got up from his throne and spoke : \n\n*The following is a dialogue between the Eliotropi and General X moments before the transformation:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\nEliotropi 1 , 2 &amp; 3  : “ These were the best we could find your honor!”\n\nGeneral X: “Perfect …  After centuries of studying humanity these seem to be the perfect test subjects for the treiglad trials !”\n\nEliotropi 2 : “ B- but it’s too dangerous !”\n\nEliotropi 3: “ He’s completely right ! If something goes wrong our entire species runs the risk of becoming extinct !”\n\nGeneral X “ Well there’s only one way of finding out.”\n\nEliotropi 2&amp;3 : “ BUT!!!”\n\nGeneral X “ Be quiet and get out!!!”\n\n————————————————————————————————————-\n\nMoments later , I along with 2 other kids were separated from the rest of the group. We were forced to retrace our path until we finally came across a shiny grey metal door that I hadn’t taken notice of before . The soldier pushed us aside , grabbed a key out of his pocket and opened it . We walked down the stairs until we made it into a room that contained 3 giant glass chambers. I STARTED TO PANIC AT THAT MOMENT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THESE SAVAGES , I SCREAMED IN PROTEST TRYING TO LET MYSElF FREE FROM THE CHAINS I HAD TIED TO ME , but it was useless…\n\nThat was the last thing I could remember from that day . When I finally woke up , I could see I  was still chained up and was floating in a sea of purple acid . I looked around me and that’s when I saw my reflection. I looked completely different , my skin was dark and its texture was rough , my eyes were glowing purple and spikes started to protrude from my arms , legs and back . \n\nMoments later , 5 Eliotropi showed up , they unlocked my chamber and removed the chains I had tied up to me. I looked to my sides and saw that one of the two remaining chambers was also being unlocked . I watched in awe as the creature emerged from the chamber . It was massive and was covered with messy dark-silver fur that ran from the top of its head all the way to the bottom of its feet , it also had massive dark gray feathers like that of a “Lammergeier”. The real horror came when it started to flap its wings aggressively at the Eliotropi and opened its mouth , to reveal thousands of squirming worms in the place where teeth should have been  , the Eliotropi acted quickly and injected it with a tranquilizer that made it fall to the ground , leaving it in a dormant state . Moments later I heard slow footsteps approaching the chamber , I looked behind me and caught sight of General X . He signaled me to follow him and I did , we exited the chamber and walked until we arrived at a spiral staircase leading into the palace’s balcony .\n\nOnce we had finally made it there ,  he made his way to the front of the balcony and addressed the Eliotropi :\n\n———————————————————————————————————\n\n***GX : “Welcome everyone !***\n\n***\\*The crowd cheers\\****\n\n***GX: Yes , Yes , I know all of you are very happy now that you have filled your stomachs after centuries of awaiting your next meal , BUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS REUNION IS NOT TO CELEBRATE OUR VICTORY , BUT RATHER, TO WELCOME A NEW MEMBER TO OUR FAMILY!!*** \n\nIt was at this moment where the Eliotropi holding me back , finally let me go , I walked to the front of the balcony and proceeded to look down below me. I was shocked to see thousands of Eliotropi all gathered at around the palace steps. GX then proceeded to hand me a cape along with a helmet just like his and continued with his speech.\n\n***GX: PLEASE WELCOME “UDUMEES”, COMMANDER IN CHIEF , THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL TEST  SUBJECT TO THE “TREIGLAD TRIALS***”!\n\n\\*Crowd cheers and applauds\\* \n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\nThat was 2495 years ago ,\n\nAfter that day , I learned many things about the “Newel” kingdom ,  but out of all the teachings one stood out to me the most and that was the one relating to the invasion on planet earth. Here is what it stated :\n\n“Every 2500 earth years , we serve the right and consider  it to be our responsibility to invade earth in order to preserve all the life and order present in “Newel ”. 5 years before our arrival a “Nimbus” will form in the sky , it will progressively get stronger as the years go on , once it reaches its final stage a portal will form in the sky which will allow us to enter earth with ease . During the invasion we will take with us as much of humanity deemed necesary in order to preserve our population alive . ANY DISRUPTIONS TO OUR ACTIVITY WILL RESULT IN FATAL CONSEQUENCES TO THE INDIVIDUALS AND TO THE COSMOS AS WE KNOW IT. ”.   You may choose to do what you wish with this information , regardless of your final decision just remember that time is running out and for that -\n\n“We are sorry”",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10qj6n9/the_fell_witch_and_the_bánánach_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n*The staircase was gone.* \n\nIn its place was more stone and plaster wall, faced with yet another shelf bearing the weight of those same mason jars, their contents long since clouded and obscured. In a growing panic, we all spun about, out lights playing across the rest of the room, all of us assuming we must have gotten turned around and disoriented, but it took only a moment to confirm the impossible; the room was *different* now than it had been only moments before.\n\nIt was then we realized that other things had changed as well. In addition to our flashlights and Nick’s camera-mounted light, oil lamps hung from hooks scattered around the room, providing a dim and flickering illumination of the shelves and their contents. The pages that had previously been scattered across the small desk were instead now arranged in a neat pattern across its surface, lit by four guttering red candles, one at each corner of the table like silent sentries.\n\n“What the *hell?*” Nick exclaimed in shock, and I felt my world shake for a moment, as if my brain was trying to process what was happening and was failing horribly.\n\nI staggered and reached out to his shoulder for support, focusing on my breathing for a long moment until my pounding heart began to settle and my vision cleared.\n\n“What… what just happened?” I said, my voice shaking and coming as a hoarse whisper. \n\nMy eyes alighted in that moment on something else that had changed in that dark cellar. One of the shelves had been swung away from the wall, exposing a roughly excavated tunnel entrance in the plaster and stone. Our lights showed us that the stygian darkness beyond looked to be a sort of natural cave, winding inward and downward into the heart of the hillside.\n\nI looked over to Sarah, who stood now back at the table, studying the papers intently. Her face was twisted in a frown, but I didn’t think it was the sudden shift in reality that was her focus now.\n\n“Sarah?” I asked carefully, not sure if the shock of the moment had perhaps been too much for her to accept. I couldn’t understand why she would have turned back to the desk when faced with the impossibility that stood before us now.\n\nShe answered without looking up from the pages. “The whole thing is backwards,” she said, flipping the page and continuing her study of the next. “I don’t think Abigail Greer turned to witchcraft after her father died. Listen to this:\n\n*“… I fear that my father’s loss last season was too great a burden for mother to bear. She has turned back to the old ways of her Celtic ancestry, to that black knowledge that she swore to abandon when they first wed. For fifteen years she kept that promise, bringing me and my brother into this world under God’s holy light. But I have found the entrance she has unearthed in the dark of the cellar. I have seen, to my horror, the ancient scrawling that cover every inch of this place, and the madness of the signs that she has constructed. My mind rebels and I have prayed for the Lord’s guidance, but I have heard nothing. I no longer feel His light in this place.*\n\n*“I am afraid that mother’s descent into this madness and evil has shadowed my family and removed us from God’s grace. We are alone now. I have heard terrible sounds from the entrance to the pit and we have not seen mother in nearly a week. Elias has taken ill, and I fear that he may follow my father to the grave if he does not soon recover from his malaise.”*\n\nShe paused and looked at me, still holding the page. \n\nI frowned. “I thought you weren’t able to read them?”\n\nSarah shrugged and shook her head in confusion. “I don’t know how to explain it, but these pages are written in colonial English, not much different than what we speak now. Definitely not that gibberish we saw before.”\n\n“Well, that’s the least of it,” I said, looking back over my shoulder. Nick had moved closer to the rough opening in the cellar wall, shining his camera light into the tunnel.\n\nI raised my voice. “Nick? Don’t wander, yeah?”\n\nHe just spared a quick glance at me and gave a vague nod and half-hearted wave before turning back to the tunnel.\n\n“What else does it say? Anything about spontaneous redecorating of the cellar?” I tried to force a little humor into my voice, to lighten the tone, but even before the words left my mouth, I knew they’d fallen flat.\n\nSarah picked up another sheet from the table. “This one must be from later. There aren’t any dates, but listen:\n\n*“I saw mother today. Elias has only grown worse. His skin is hot to the touch, and he cannot keep down broth or bread. My brother is wasting before my eyes! I ventured down to the cellar, which I had been avoiding for a week or more and called for mother in that dark and black tunnel. I pleaded with her to come help Elias and eventually she emerged.*\n\n*“When first I laid eyes upon her, I barely recognized her for who she was. It seemed almost that she had gone nearly feral, so wild were her eyes. Her great fall of bright red hair, which had always been a source of pride for her and her Celtic ancestry, now rose around her head in a tangle, making her seem more beast than woman! Her dress was disheveled and torn in places, but it was the crimson stains splashed across the breast that drew my attention in that instant. I thought I would flee at that moment, but thoughts of my brother emboldened me, and I spoke to her.* \n\n*“I pleaded with her to come help him, but it seemed there was barely any recognition in her eyes when she set them upon me. After a long while, she pushed past me, nearly sending me toppling to the ground, and gained the staircase to the house above, all the while murmuring in a tongue foreign to me, which I assume was that of her homeland. I ran after her, but when I reached the sitting room, where I had been attempting to nurse Elias, I found she had taken him in her arms and was returning to the cellar. I moved to follow her, but she set upon me a gaze so cold and inhuman and lacking any sort of recognition, that I froze and could not proceed. When I recovered my wits, I ran to the cellar doorway, but was met with such horrid and tortured sounds from below that I could not bring myself to descend. I have seen neither of them since.”*\n\nI looked back over my shoulder and saw Nick had taken a step inside the entrance to the tunnel. He was crouched a bit and peering into it intently, using the powerful camera light to try to dispel the gloom.\n\n“Nick,” I said, but he didn’t seem to hear me. “Nick!” At that, he straightened as much as the low tunnel would allow and looked back at me with questioning eyes, not responding. \n\n“Stay close to us. Don’t go wandering off,” I told him, shaking my head and turning back to Sarah. \n\nShe’d set the papers down and picked up the last one.\n\n“*It has been two days since I saw mother or Elias. I fear that she has called forth something foul and unclean from the pit in the madness that fell upon her after my father’s death. I remember some of the things that my maternal grandmother told me when we were still in Boston. She used to tell us stories about the old world and the witchery that festered there, before my father put an end to it. I remember that salt spread across a threshold is said to bar a witch’s passage and keep the blackness at bay, so I have done this at the entrance to the cellar. I am more terrified in this moment than I have ever been in my life, but I cannot abandon Elias. He is all I have left of my father now. Tonight, I will take my rosery and lamp and venture into the cellar tunnel in search of my brother. May God hear my prayers and protect me with his light. – Abigail Greer.”*\n\n“Jesus,” I said. “If that’s true-“ I stopped mid-thought, realizing that Nick was now nowhere to be seen. I ran to the mouth of the tunnel and shone my flashlight beam into it, calling out for our companion.\n\nSarah was at my side in an instant. “He didn’t go in there, did he?” she said, eyes wide.\n\nI gave a quick nod and stepped into the rough-hewn tunnel, my flashlight held before me to guide our way. The air within was much colder than that in the cellar, and that stench from earlier grew more pungent and tenacious than before, rolling my stomach with each step.\n\nThere was something wrong with the air here, something beyond the drop in temperature or the foul stench that assailed our progress. \n\nIt felt *bad*. Spoiled.\n\nI don’t know any other way to describe it – it was as if the air itself had turned against us, protesting our intrusion. I pulled the neck of my shirt up to cover my mouth and nose, but it didn’t help much. \n\nThe tunnel fell before us in a gentle descent that wound left and right like the tracks of a serpent. I called out to Nick a few times but received no reply in the thick darkness. Onward and downward we trailed for what felt like hundreds of feet. I thought we must be well under the hill at this point and couldn’t begin to guess how deep our travel had taken us. \n\nIt was then that we rounded another in the long series of the left-and-right meandering of the tunnel and froze in our tracks, our eyes fixing instantly on the discarded camera. It had been smashed; its pieces strewn violently across the rough floor of the cave before us. \n\nI raised my light again and called out for Nick. Again, I was met without a response, but now I feared for my friend even more; I wasn’t sure whether he’d brought a flashlight, and with his camera now reduced to bits of plastic, metal, and glass on the bedrock floor, he’d be traveling blind in the abyssal darkness. With no idea what may lie ahead – whether it was a solid wall or sheer cliff falling into the bowels of the earth – continuing his walk would have been lunacy.\n\n*What was going on?*\n\n“*Nick!*” I shouted again, but this time my ears caught the hint of a reply, echoing from the distance. \n\nSarah looked at me and, without a word, we rushed into motion, moving as quickly as the dancing flashlights would allow in the narrow tunnel.\n\nAfter a short time, we burst from the tunnel into a wide chamber and skidded to a halt. My injured ankle threatened to betray me, and I only stayed upright by sheer luck. \n\nWe had emerged from the darkness into a surreal nightmare, which even now I have trouble describing.\n\nThe chamber was wide – perhaps thirty feet across – and roughly dome-shaped. The flickering orange light from hundreds of tapers positioned about the relatively smooth floor gave a hellish glow to the room, dim enough to preclude plain sight, but cursedly bright enough to see the macabre tableau laid out before us.\n\nA great white symbol was etched into the stone floor of the cave, looking to my untrained eyes very much like the one we’d seen in the cellar. As with the other, this appeared to be constructed of hundreds and thousands of smaller symbols and glyphs, all of which were foreign to me. Unlike the former, this one had been scratched into the stone itself with some sharp instrument.\n\nThe air in this chamber was not stale or chill, as we had experienced previously, but was instead warm and flowing, weaving in and out of the multitude of other tunnels that I realized intersected with this chamber. Despite the constant airflow, the candle flames appeared indifferent and continued their slow consumption of the crimson-colored wax.\n\nI realize only now that it was my mind that chose to first catalogue each of these relatively mundane characteristics of the chamber in order to protect itself – a sort of safety mechanism to prevent the shock of the scene from flooding in all at once, overwhelming my sanity and leaving me a gibbering mess, curled up sobbing on the floor in a pool of my own waste.\n\nSarah was quicker to process everything, though, and her horrified scream drew my eyes to the unholy abomination that lay before us, snapping me back to the present jarringly.\n\nIron forged-link chains from a bygone age hung from the ceiling at the edges of the great circular symbol, and from them were suspended the corpses of three people, hung by their wrists, all dressed in colonial puritan garb and all looking as fresh as if they were only sleeping. My eyes darted from one to the next, disbelieving what I was seeing, and I felt my mind lose a little more of its grip at that moment. The first was an older man, clean-shaven and gray-haired. He was tall and wore a simple carved wooden cross around his neck, which I noted was bent at a grotesque angle and allowed his head to rest unnaturally low against his chest. The second was a young boy, perhaps ten years old, with pallid skin slicked with perspiration and deep sunken eyes rimmed in dark red circles. The third was a blond girl in her mid-teens, wearing a rosary around her neck.\n\nI don’t know how long we stood there, staring at this impossible sight. These people were more than two hundred years dead, yet looked as if they might open their eyes at any moment. Then my sight fell to the great red stains that started at the ghastly and ragged incisions across their bellies and painted everything below in that nightmare hue. The blood had splashed across the outer edges of the great circular seal, obscuring some of the glyphs and runes etched there. Impossibly, it still glistened wet in the flickering candlelight.\n\nI turned away before my stomach had the chance to rebel and spill my lunch all over the cavern floor.\n\n“The Greers…” Sarah whispered in astonishment, taking an unconscious step forward.\n\n“All except for one,” I croaked in a hoarse voice. “Where is Fiona, the mother?”\n\nA moment later, I found the answer to my question. As I stepped carefully around the horrifying scene, the body of Fiona Greer came into view. The woman lay rigid on her back, arms outstretched to either side, and hands splayed wide and clawing in eternal agony at the stone floor. Her dress was slashed and torn and singed in places, exposing pale and scarred skin beneath, and her hair formed a maniacal halo around her freckled face. An intricate pattern drawn in electric blue paint adorned her chin and neck, as well as across her brow. Her face was the worst of it, however. Her eye sockets were blackened and empty, and her mouth stretched open impossibly wide in an eternal scream of unimaginable torture and suffering. The skin around her mouth was blistered raw and cracked, and her tongue and teeth were soot-black, as if she had been exposed to some great blast furnace from within. \n\nHer feet rested in the center of a smaller circle, perhaps four feet in diameter, and similar in design to the larger one. It almost looked like she had been standing within the circle before she died, but as to its purpose or what might have happened to her, I had no clue. Positioned around the symbol’s edges were the remarkably preserved remnants of herbs and plants, arranged in careful patterns. A bright yellow flower stood out in my vision, creating an obscene mixture of beauty and horror in this nightmare chamber. \n\nI stared in shocked silence for a long while, unable to wrest myself back to sane thought and action, until Sarah snatched at the shoulder of my jacket, pulling me away from the gruesome sight. \n\n“*Bánánach,*” she hissed, jabbing her finger at a symbol on the floor just outside the smaller circle. “*Stupid woman!* I know what happened here,” she said, pulling me towards the cave we had entered from. “Jason, we need to leave *now*!”\n\nI hesitated. “But Nick…” I said, the words feeling flat and feeble in my mouth.\n\nShe pulled my face down to meet hers, locking eyes with me. “He’s *gone*. We need to get out of here now or we’re going to end up like her!”\n\nI hesitated another moment, something instinctual preventing me from leaving my friend behind in this chamber of horrors. Then, a ghostly howling, simultaneously mournful and predatory and *hungry*, reached us, sweeping over us from somewhere in one of the myriad of tunnels adjoining this chamber, making the decision for me.\n\nSarah shoved me hard in the direction of the exit with a fierce grunt and set me running, her footsteps close behind. I ran as hard as I could, leaving that chamber behind and navigating through the rocky tunnel. I can’t tell you how many times I missed a turn during our flight and slammed heavily into the jagged rockface, but by the time we finally emerged into the cellar once again, I was bleeding from a dozen cuts on my arms and face. \n\nI collapsed hard to the dusty floor of the cellar, knocking the wind from myself in the process. Sarah stepped over me without a word and rushed to the corner of the room, where the long-since deteriorated sacks had spilled their contents over the floor. I frowned, not understanding what she was doing.\n\n“Sarah, what-,” I started, but froze at the sound of something racing frantically through the narrow tunnel, growing closer with each breath. I could hear rocks dislodged and fall with its passing, and I wondered at what could do such a thing. The next moment, a howling scream of some otherworldly terror rattled from the shadows, reverberating in my skull and ringing my ears.\n\n“Jason, help me!” she cried, carrying two handfuls of the yellow granules back and spreading them across the threshold of the tunnel entrance. She rushed back and brought back more, but I could only sit there, paralyzed with terror, as I stared into the depths of that black cave, from where the sounds of movement rapidly grew louder. “Jason!” she screamed again.\n\nI looked at her and realized that there was no way she was going to complete her task in time. She’d made three trips already and the line was barely a third of the way across the entrance of the cave, that gaping maw of blackness that had claimed our friend.\n\nI cursed, but in that moment, I saw that the cellar was once again in the state in which we first found it, including the staircase!\n\n“Sarah! The stairs!” I shouted, scrambling to my feet.\n\nShe looked over at the stairs with astonishment and hesitated. The briefest moment of indecision crossed her eyes as she glanced down at the salt in her hands and then to the pitiful progress she’d made with the barrier. A moment later, she slung the salt aside and launched herself behind me, making for the stone stairs at a dead run.\n\nI had just turned the corner and was taking the steps two at a time when I heard whatever pursued us finally reach the cellar. The crashing and splintering of the shelves rang out loudly in the still air, but I kept my eyes on the rectangle of light ahead of me that promised salvation. I heard her footsteps close on my heels, and for a moment, I thought the staircase seemed much longer than it had when we first descended it.\n\nStill, I pushed harder, my breath ragged in my chest. Finally, I threw myself over the last few steps, landing hard on the warped floorboards and slamming my shoulder into the opposite wall. My head spun and my vision blurred for a moment, but then I was looking back at the open doorway, willing Sarah to hurry. She was farther behind me than I had thought, and I still couldn’t understand why it had taken us so long to climb the steps – there couldn’t have been more than twenty of them, I was sure.\n\nI could see her silhouette racing up the stone steps towards me and I reached out to her, ready to snatch her out of the stairwell as soon as she was within reach.\n\nBut then I also saw the twisted, distorted form racing behind her, impossibly fast and impossibly close. I heard a hissing howl as it chased her, mixed somehow with the faint and distant screams of the damned, and then glowing embers of its eyes fixed upon me and I thought I could sense a cold smile of triumph on its unseen face. \n\n“*Sarah! Come on! I’ve got you!”* I screamed, my voice breaking.\n\n*She was going to make it*; she was so close I could almost feel her warmth on my skin. She finally reached the top of the steps and launched herself toward my outstretched hands, the huge shadow looming directly behind her. Her eyes were wide with terror and her mouth gaped open with the exertion of her flight. Sarah’s fingers brushed mine, and then a sudden darkness, blacker than coal, filled the doorway and enveloped her in an instant. \n\nAnd then she was gone. The shadowed darkness faded into wisps and tendrils of sooty smoke that swirled in eddies with her passing and dissipated until none were left.\n\nThe stairwell was empty, silence once again returning to the house, save for the steady hiss of the rain outside upon the frozen ground.\n\nI was alone.\n\nI sat there for a long while, unfocused eyes fixed upon the empty cellar doorway. I might have been in shock, but I don’t think it was anything so clinical. My co-workers, my *friends*, were gone, and I had no way to explain what had happened. I didn’t dare return to the cellar, and I knew the only thing that was keeping that *thing* confined, the only thing that had likely saved my life, was the salt that Abigail Greer had spread across the threshold two hundred years before.\n\nWearily, I eventually hoisted myself to my feet and grabbed my backpack from where it lay near the open front door. Wind had blown the rain in and covered it with a freezing mist, but I barely noticed. \n\n\\*\n\nThat was two months ago. I eventually made my way back to the van and called the police, telling them that I’d woken up that morning at our motel to scout a location, but both of my co-workers had disappeared sometime in the night.\n\nIt was a weak cover, but I didn’t know what else to tell them. The truth would only land me in the nuthouse, or worse, implicated in the murders of Nick and Sarah.\n\n*Bánánach*. Sarah had used that word in the chamber. It was the only clue I had at first, and it wasn’t much of one, but after a few days of research through some areas of the internet I’ll never traverse again, I think I know what she meant.\n\nShe was always the smart one. I’ve never seen anyone so versed in as many obscure bits of information surrounding the paranormal as her. I also knew she’d always had an interest in the history of witchcraft and the black arts, so it shouldn’t have come as any surprise that she had pieced it all together so quickly, while I had been just barely holding onto my sanity.\n\nShe would have known.\n\nSarah knew that Fiona Greer had been raised in Ireland, and her mother had taught her the ways of Celtic witchcraft. She would have spent weeks researching in preparation for this location scouting. She would have known that Fiona was versed enough to ensure she was protected from the demons she was trying to summon to avenge her husband’s death, even if it had meant the grisly blood sacrifice of her own children. But it had been a long fifteen years since she had last been familiar with the ways of mysticism, and her madness had driven her to recklessness.\n\nThe yellow flowers were what stuck out in my mind. In Ireland, they would have been *Colt’s Foot*, but that flower didn’t exist in Massachusetts in the 1800s, so she had used the closest substitute she could find – daisies. But the tomes of witchcraft were very specific, I learned, and each component intended for its own particular purpose. In this case, *Colt’s Foot* was intended to protect the witch from the demon they summoned – the *Bánánach*. I can only surmise that, when the summoning was finished, Fiona Greer was left with nothing to protect her from the horrifying entity she had raised and had paid dearly for her mistake.\n\nI quit my job after that and have been living off my meager and rapidly dwindling savings since then. I’ve been haunted by terrifying visions every night since that day, and rarely sleep more than a couple hours at a time anymore.\n\nLast night, I awoke with a start, covered in sweat and wide-eyed, the phantom howl of some unremembered dream still fading in my ears. My unconscious mind had wandered back to that day and turned everything over, reliving every hellish moment. And it was then that the mental image flashed into my awareness like a freeze-frame, draining the blood from my face and sweeping over me with the cold wash of nausea at the sudden, horrifying, realization.\n\nIt was the image of the yellowed granules spread carefully across the cellar threshold; the neat, unbroken line of salt placed there by Abigail Greer as a ward against the darkness she knew her mother had summoned. It was the memory of how I had broken that barrier with the careless and ignorant scuffing of my boot before we three had started our descent to the cellar on that stormy [November day.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JIsvWfQr41ant2OGjmJkg)",

        "text": "“Whoa,” Nick said in muted surprise, halting abruptly. He was standing on a slight rise a little way ahead of me, one hand resting on the winter-bare and age-twisted trunk of an old oak. I saw him raise his camera and take a few shots at the landscape ahead, hidden from me by the rise in the forest floor. We’d been climbing a slight incline for a bit, and it looked like it crested where he stood, dropping away beyond.\n\n“What? Did you find another frozen stream for me to bust my ass on?” I asked sourly. I was still favoring my sore ankle from where I had slipped on that patch of ice an hour ago and twisted it a little. It didn’t hurt too bad, I guess, but the long hike through the uneven terrain of the woods didn’t help it – or my mood, for that matter. I was tired, cold, and nursing a bit of a hangover from last night. *We shouldn’t have stayed so long at that little roadside bar*, I thought for the hundredth time today. I sidestepped a rock protruding from the frozen ground as I approached where he stood, careful in my footing.\n\n*Who goes hiking through the backwoods of Massachusetts in November?*\n\nBut I knew the answer to that question – *we* did. Being a location scout for an honest-to-goodness TV show sounded like a grand adventure when I took the job a year ago. The fact that it was a paranormal show only added to the excitement and mystique. Unfortunately, the reality wasn’t quite as glamorous or exciting as the fantasy had been in my mind. Most of our time was spent on the road, living out of motels and eating greasy truck stop food or whatever fast food appeared at the next exit on the highway. I’d definitely seen some interesting sights over the last thirteen months, but I was starting to mentally balance the benefits against the monotony. \n\nI think I had built it up in my mind that we would be the first ones of the entire production crew to really experience the sites that would be used as segments in the show. Maybe we’d even get to see something truly amazing during our scouting, some hint that all the legends and stories about these supposedly haunted places might have some basis in truth. So far, it had been a whirlwind tour of abandoned and derelict buildings and places across the Northeast, seasoned with a lot of oddball and borderline nutjob witnesses to the supposed supernatural events that occurred there. \n\nTruth-to-tell, it had grown more depressing than anything else after a while. When you stepped back and really thought about it, you started realizing that every abandoned factory or house had been someone’s failed dreams, abandoned when they were no longer able to carry on with them. It started to feel a bit like we were scavengers or grave robbers, just picking through the remnants of other people’s lives and loss.\n\nOn top of it all, in all that time, I hadn’t seen anything at any of these places that couldn’t be easily explained as natural and mundane – *only* mysterious and otherworldly if looked at through the lens of someone who really, desperately, *wanted* to believe that something else was at work. Sure, spending a night in a supposedly haunted asylum, abandoned prison, or the site of some brutal massacre from a hundred years ago could definitely set the imagination to wander, especially when it was dark and you were in a strange environment all alone. But, in the light of day, when you could see things more clearly for what they really were, it just became a little sad and frustrating. Even now, I held out some little hope with every new site we scouted that we’d get to experience something even a little unexplainable. Something that could help validate all the time and effort that we’d expended in our searches.\n\nHell, at this point, I’d have taken even a ghostly handprint on a window or the half-seen flutter of movement in an attic window, so long as we weren’t able to immediately debunk either one.\n\n“We found it,” Nick said, turning to me with a wide grin. We’d worked together since I started this job, and he’d been here even before that. Somehow, he still had that giddy air of an excited child on Christmas morning whenever we reached our scout location. \n\n“Really? You mean it *actually* still exists?” said Sarah, trudging up from behind me. She glanced at me sideways as she passed me to join Nick, as if to ask me why I ever doubted her.\n\nI hitched up the shoulder pack carrying my audio equipment as I followed. Even though we were just location scouts, part of our job was to capture some b-roll video and audio while we were here.\n\nI joined Nick and Sarah, carefully stepping over the roots that littered the forest floor, spreading out like veins from the trees and threatening to trip us with every step. From that vantage point, I found myself looking down the leaf-covered slope that fell gently away from where we stood. Amidst the collage of oaks and pines that partially obscured our view, I could see the unmistakable shape and color of the old two-story house at the base of the hill. Its whitewashed clapboard exterior was badly faded and time-worn from the two hundred years it had stood here, hidden miles from anywhere that could be considered civilization, even in those times. \n\n“Wow,” Sarah said simply, her eyebrows raised in muted surprise. She wasn’t like Nick – she wasn’t a *true believer*. But she also wasn’t like me; she still had an open mind behind her practicality. She considered herself a mutable skeptic, always searching for something that could convince her of the legitimate existence of the paranormal, but also demanding of evidence to support it. \n\n*Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof*. It was a favorite axiom of hers, a quote from Carl Sagan, I think. But she was always open to the possibility of the existence of that proof.\n\nI was a little different. I’d taken the job because it was a foothold in the film industry and would look good on my resume, not because I was searching for some higher truth or evidence of the *great beyond*. Yeah, I’d hoped I’d get to experience something unexplainable during my tenure, but, in truth, I’d never really expected it. I was more concerned about spiders and snakes than I was about ghosts and ghouls.\n\nNick motioned us to follow him as he started down the hillside, careful in his footing on the hard and slippery ground.\n\nAt least it hadn’t snowed, so we didn’t have that to contend with.\n\nSarah followed Nick, with me bringing up the rear. My ankle wasn’t appreciative of the descent, but it wasn’t too bad.\n\n“I was expecting a log cabin or some sort of dilapidated shack. Why the hell would someone build an actual, honest-to-God, house out here in the middle of the woods?” I asked. “It’s got to be, what, fifteen miles to the nearest town?”\n\nIt was Sarah who answered, our resident site researcher and historian. \n\n“According to what little I was able to find on this place, the house was built in the 1790s by Thomas Greer. He was the local vicar of the nearby settlement of Ander’s Cross, a couple miles in that direction,” she said, pointing vaguely to her right.\n\n“A local settlement?” I asked. “I didn’t think there was anything around here but trees.”\n\n“There’s not, anymore,” she replied. “Ander’s Cross was abandoned sometime between 1810 and 1815 and left to fall to ruin after a mysterious illness swept through, killing most of the settlers. I doubt there’s much there anymore.”\n\nI grinned inwardly. A spooky and mysterious history always helped with the believability of the story, if nothing else. “Sounds like we have all the makings of a good episode. Nat’s going to be happy about this. It’s going to be a bitch to haul all the gear out here for the shoot, though. She’s probably going to want to rely a lot on b-roll and voiceovers – limit the amount of time the production crew needs to spend out here.”\n\nNeither of them answered as we continued picking our way down the frozen incline, moving from tree to tree for stability and using as many of the exposed roots as ad-hoc stairs as we could. Before too long, the ground leveled out and we found ourselves at the edge of the clearing that surrounded the old house. The tree line had started trying to reclaim the area, but it didn’t appear as successful as I would have assumed in its attempt, and the house still stood alone in the open ground. Only sparse and twisted underbrush had been able to make any progress in the siege, which I found mildly curious.\n\nNow free of the trees, we moved more easily, circling around to the front of the house. It was two stories, built in the simple New England aesthetic of the day. It wasn’t much more than a box, the front door and windows the only external characteristics able to break the austere modesty of the structure. The shingles of the sharply sloped roof were surprisingly mostly still present, and the cobblestone chimney that protruded from the center of the peak looked almost like it could start emitting smoke at any moment. \n\n“They really built them to last, didn’t they?” I said with a small whistle. “I’m impressed – this thing looks almost like it could be lived in today with a little work.”\n\nSarah nodded absently, her eyes taking in the details of the house with keen interest. “Yeah,” she said ponderously, and I could hear something pregnant in the way she said it.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I asked.\n\nShe tore her eyes from the house and looked at me with a smile and a sniff. “Nothing. It’s just weird to see it in this good of condition. It’s not unusual to find remnants of human habitation scattered throughout the woods of the Northeast. We’ve all seen them – sometimes you’ll just stumble across a home’s foundation or even what’s left of a basement in the middle of the woods. If you’re really lucky, you might find the remains of brick walls or a well.”\n\nNick joined us, that stupid grin still plastered across his face. “Yeah, this is *amazing*! You really hit the jackpot this time, Sarah. It looks pretty solid – we might even be able to film inside. Nat’s going to be stoked about this one.” After that, he was off again, taking video of the entire area.\n\nI looked back at Sarah and grinned with a small shake of my head. Nick was irrepressible – that’s probably one of the things that made him so endearing to everyone he met. It was almost a childlike air of enthusiasm that surrounded him and was often infectious.\n\n“So, what’s the story here?” I asked, turning my attention back to the face of the house, noting how the front door hung partially open. That was good – it meant we’d likely be able to take a look inside without damaging anything in order to get in. “I thought you said a witch lived here, not a priest.”\n\n“Thomas Greer was a *vicar*, not a priest,” she corrected me. “He was part of the original settlement of Ander’s cross and brought his wife, Fiona, and children, Abigail and Elias, out here from Boston, believing that God had called him out from the city to ensure that the holy word accompanied the settlers.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” I said, scanning the darkened and glass-less windows. I couldn’t see any detail within, as the day had grown late, and the shadows had already overtaken this little clearing. “So, where’s the witch come in?”\n\n“Same old story we’ve heard before. The settlers’ crops had a bad year, their livestock started dying, and some of them had contracted some sort illness from a wandering trader.” Sarah took a few steps closer to the house, looking up at the shadowed windows of the second floor. “They needed to blame someone, and since Thomas Greer was supposed to be bringing the protection of the Lord with him, they started casting suspicions that maybe he wasn’t quite as holy as he professed. Someone at some point whispered the word *witch*, and it wasn’t long before the settlers descended on him one night and took out their superstitious fears on him.” She gestured vaguely around the clearing. “According to the diary of Abigale, his daughter, they hauled him out in the middle of a stormy night and hanged him from one of these trees.”\n\n“*Jesus*,” I said. “Nothing like some dark-age frontier justice to make you appreciate modern society, I guess. What happened to his wife and kids?”\n\nSarah turned her eyes back to me and shrugged. “It’s unclear. According to what little I was able to find, it appears that Fiona Greer – the mother – disappeared or committed suicide a year later. As far as Abigail and Elias, there’s not much else. The settlers wrote of strange happenings after the death of Thomas Greer. Babies and livestock stillborn or badly deformed, children gone missing in the night without any evidence of their leaving, that sort of stuff. There was even some sort of affliction that caused a number of the settlers to go completely blind. The rest is history.”\n\nI nodded. “Some pretty *dark* history, I guess,” I said. \n\nNick reappeared at our side, his eyes still alight. “Let’s check out the inside,” he said.\n\nI looked up at the sky, which had grown even darker, the waning light of afternoon now choked out by thick gray clouds. The forecast hadn’t called for storms, so we hadn’t really come prepared for one. “Maybe we should come back tomorrow. It looks like rain, and we didn’t really bring any cold-weather camping gear with us.”\n\nNick pointed at the front door. “Just a quick look, Jason,” he coaxed, “Heck, if it’s in as good of a condition inside as it is on the outside, we can probably just sleep in there tonight.”\n\nSarah met my eyes and gave a minute shrug, as if to say that it wasn’t a *terrible* idea. \n\nI hesitated a moment, torn between wanting to sleep in my relatively comfortable motel bed tonight and the unpleasant prospect of a three-hour hike back through a winter rainstorm. \n\nFinally, I acquiesced. “Okay, but if it doesn’t look like it’s going to be a good shelter, we’re going to haul ass back for the van, deal?”\n\nNick nodded and the three of us headed towards the faded and peeling front door of the house. I felt the sudden chill of the wind that blew up from the trees, ruffling my hair and tugging at my jacket, and the distant murmuring of thunder reached my ears. Though the vicar’s house promised the best protection from the coming storm, strange and unidentifiable misgivings had begun to settle themselves in my mind, and I thought that perhaps a trudge through freezing rain might be the better option, after all.\n\nReaching the front door, I grabbed the rusted iron handle and pulled, somewhat surprised when it swung open on squealing hinges without much resistance. Nick stepped past me and led the way, camera sweeping the entry as he went. I was close behind, and Sarah followed us, retrieving a powerful LED flashlight from her pack and switching it on. \n\nThe interior was gloomy and foreboding, and our footsteps on the ancient, warped floorboards sounded far too loud in the damp and stale atmosphere within. Tiny dust motes glittered in the light as they drifted upon the still air, now disturbed by us three trespassers.\n\n*It smells like a freshly exhumed grave*, I thought, and smiled faintly at the melodramatic thought. It was like I was writing the copy for the show and thought that Nat had definitely begun to rub off on me.\n\nWe stood in the shadowed foyer now and I retrieved my own flashlight, the harsh light illuminating the room. The walls were lath and plaster, huge sections now bare where time had crumpled the coverings to the floor, exposing the thin wooden slats beneath. The floorboards looked to be in surprisingly good condition, though the wood was now gray with age and the edges swollen from moisture and blackened with mold. It looked as if there had at one time been a carpet runner in the center of the room, but now all that remained was the ghost of a silhouette to mark its passage.\n\nOn the left wall was a staircase that rose to the second floor, with a door beneath it that I guessed was probably a storage closet. To our right, a squared archway led to what looked like a dining area, with a long rectangular table and benches on either side. Its surface was covered with a moth-eaten tablecloth, its design faded beyond recognition. \n\n“Look at this place,” said Nick in wonder, the light atop his camera casting harsh illumination around the room and causing shadows to dance in the corners of our vision. “It’s amazing. It’s like being at one of those living history museums.”\n\n“It’s something, all right,” intoned Sarah, her voice seeming faraway and distracted. She shone her light up the staircase for a moment, then turned to inspect the dining area.\n\nThe sudden flash of lightning and crack of thunder startled all three of us, and we laughed at our skittishness when we met each other’s eyes. We’d been in similar places dozens of times, many with far more disturbing histories than this, but something about this place seemed… different, somehow. I couldn’t put my finger on it, until Nick spoke again.\n\n“It feels *real*. Like a family *really* lived here,” he said.\n\nSarah snorted. “A family *did* live here, genius,” she replied.\n\n“Yeah, I know, but everywhere we’ve gone before has felt like we were just looking at an old photograph, like the life was long gone from the image. *This* house, though – it doesn’t feel like that; it doesn’t feel *dead*. It feels like, I don’t know…”\n\n“Like it’s waiting for them to come back,” I said.\n\nNick looked at me, his eyes a little wider and less awe-struck than before. He nodded. “Yeah, exactly.”\n\nThe three of us turned back to the open doorway as the sound of rain reached our ears from outside, growing quickly from a soft pattering breath to something that sounded remarkably close to the angry hissing of a frying pan. Inside, we were dry and protected from the sudden downpour and I was glad Nick had convinced me to stay. To say the march back through the winter rain and woods would have been miserable would have been an understatement. \n\nWe dropped our backpacks inside the entryway and wandered around the ground floor, taking in the place. Time-worn chairs sat before a soot-blackened hearth in the sitting room, their cloth covers little more than ragged remnants hanging sadly over wooden frames. Beside the hearth leaned a small bookshelf supporting dozens of ruined books, their pages bloated and indecipherable from moisture and age. \n\nThe kitchen was the same, though here the ravages of time took their toll by way of the rust and corrosion that inexorably ate away at the iron utensils and cutlery. \n\nAfter exploring the rest of the ground floor, we found ourselves back in the foyer, standing next to what I had assumed was the under-stairs storage. I was preparing to head up to the second floor to continue our investigation there when Sarah opened the door and made a small choked sound of surprise. I backed away from the steps and joined her at the open door.\n\n“What is it?” I asked.\n\n“A cellar, it looks like,” she said, nodding to the blackness beyond the small doorway. I could see the stone stairs descending from where we stood in the illumination from our flashlights.\n\nNick joined us, nudging between us with his camera before recoiling with a sour expression. Before he even said anything, we’d already smelled it.\n\n“What *is* that?” he asked, stepping back from the doorway.\n\nI shook my head. “I’m not sure. Maybe a dead animal?”\n\nIn truth, it was something more than just the reek of decomposition that wafted up from the darkness below, though that was certainly the lion’s share of it. Mingled in that almost palpable miasma of stench that assaulted us was something else – something sour and earthy and *old*. Something that our primitive instincts railed against, shouting for us to stay away. \n\nI took a tentative step forward, trying to breathe through my nose, and shone my flashlight down the steps. The beam was bright and lit the stone and clay stairwell without difficulty. The walls glistened with moisture, and the worn steps looked slick and covered with that same mold that was staining the edges of the warped floorboards.  \n\nAnother step forward and I felt my shoe scuff across something gritty at the threshold. I looked down and saw a line of yellowed granules spread across the cellar doorway, only broken where the sole of my boot had disturbed it. I turned a questioning eye to Sarah, who just shrugged.\n\n“Rat poison, maybe?” she offered. “Whatever it is, it looks like it’s been there for a long time. I wouldn’t go tasting it to see what it is, if I were you.”\n\n“It’s not like I was going to,” I said with a smirk. “That’s why we brought Nick along.”\n\nNick was distracted, though, and didn’t rise to my jab. He had approached the threshold once more, his camera raised and recording as he placed an experimental foot on the top step. “It’s okay,” he said, not sparing a glance from his viewfinder. “It’s not as slippery as it looks. Let’s see what’s down here.”\n\nEvery horror movie I’d ever seen told me that this was an abysmally bad idea, but deep down, I didn’t think we’d find anything other than the carcasses of a few dead animals that had found their way into the cellar and were unable to find their way out again. \n\nNick took another step, and I followed his lead. I felt Sarah’s hand on my shoulder to steady her balance as she stayed close. I thought I could feel a slight tremble to her grip and wondered what had her so rattled about this place. I glanced back at her and saw her narrowed eyes, keenly watching her footing as we slowly descended. There was something else in her expression, though; something was occupying her thoughts.\n\n“You all right?” I asked, turning my eyes back to the slick stone below my feet.\n\n“Yeah, sure,” she said after a moment. “I just feel like I’m missing something.”\n\n“Like what?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know. It’s like there’s something at the back of my mind, just out of reach. It’s nothing,” she said, and I could hear that she had already pushed it aside, whatever it had been.\n\nNick finally reached the bottom of the stairs and turned left, disappearing around the corner of the wall. I followed and we found ourselves in a wide stone cellar that looked to run the length of the house above. The walls were lined with deep shelves, each laden with hundreds of mason jars containing unidentifiable substances. In the far corner lay the remains of what appeared to be burlap sacks, the cloth long since having deteriorated enough to spill their contents in a lumpy pile of the same yellowed granules we’d seen at the head of the stairs. \n\n*If that’s rat poison, they must have had a hell of an infestation,* I thought.\n\nPlaying the flashlights around the rest of the room, we were surprised to see what appeared to be the remains of a small cot against one wall, and beside it, a makeshift desk covered in what appeared to be surprisingly preserved papers, brown and stained with age and moisture, but intact, nonetheless. \n\n“What the hell is this?” Nick said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe smell was stronger down here, but we were slowly becoming accustomed to it, and it wasn’t as staggering as it had been at first. The air was stale and cold and tasted of death, or at least that’s as best as I could describe it. It was unlike anything I’d experienced before.\n\n“A root cellar?” I guessed, still moving my light over the shelves. “Isn’t that what it’s called?”\n\nSarah nodded. “That’s one name for it, and I think it might have been used as one, at least at one time.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n\nShe nodded towards the small bed. “Clearly, somebody decided to live down here at some point. I don’t see any empty jars or containers anywhere, so I don’t think they were subsisting off the supplies.” She walked slowly over to the table, shining her light across the pages.\n\n“Holy shit,” she whispered, picking one page up and examining it closely. “I think these were written by Abigail Greer.”\n\n“No kidding?” I moved to her side, peering down at the precise and compact handwriting neatly filling the pages. Intermixed with the script, which I couldn’t get a good enough view of to try to read, were strange drawings and symbols. “That’s great news! Can you imagine what this is going to do for the show? We’ve actually discovered previously unknown historical documents written by Abigail Greer herself, sole survivor of the Greer family.”\n\n“What’s it say?” Nick asked from across the room, lowering his camera for the first time since we entered the cellar.\n\nSarah stared a long moment at the pages, turning her attention from the one she held to the others scattered across the wooden table. A frown adorned her face as she examined them. “It’s difficult to read. It’s like a mix between middle English and old German.”\n\n“Is that the same as how she wrote her diary?” I asked.\n\nSarah shook her head but didn’t look away from the pages. “I don’t know. I never had the originals. I only had a transcribed version that was sent to me from the Massachusetts historical society.”\n\nI pointed at the symbols on the pages. “What are those?”\n\nAgain, she shook her head. “I don’t know.”\n\n“Well, I’m no expert, but that looks like some black magic, Necronomicon-type stuff there,” I said. “I thought you said her father was falsely accused.”\n\n“He was,” Sarah answered, replacing the papers to the table as she turned back to face us. “It was rumored that, after his death and her mother’s suicide, Abigail Greer actually did turn to witchcraft to try to seek revenge on those that had a part in it. But it was just rumor and nothing about it was mentioned in her diary, so it’s been largely discounted.”\n\nA creaking sound from somewhere above us drew our eyes to the ceiling in unison. It was accompanied by the howl of the wind as the storm grew in intensity outside. As we reflexively raised our lights toward the sound, we all gasped in surprise.\n\nWords scrawled in a careful and spidery script covered every inch of the bare floor joists over our heads, high enough that even the tallest of us wouldn’t have been able to brush the wood with our fingertips. Whatever had been used to write it was dark and off-black in color and very fine. The hand was steady and neat, but the indecipherable words were written in such a compact and precise manner that it was difficult at first to even recognize it as text. \n\nThe sentences, if that was what they were, were haphazard in their orientation, and some lines overlapped others, creating a chaos that hurt my eyes to look upon.\n\n“That almost looks like Gaelic. But, how could she have even done this?” I asked, my mouth agape. “That ceiling has to be nine feet above the floor.”\n\nSarah only grunted in reply, her eyes fixed upon the writing as she meandered about the cellar, scanning it with her flashlight beam. I heard her breath catch in her chest and looked over to where she stood, transfixed by an elaborate circular diagram directly above her. \n\n“Holy crap,” she breathed. “Would you look at this?”\n\nI moved to her side, looking closer at the diagram. It was elaborate and complex in its construction, two concentric circles, the largest almost six feet across and perfectly constructed. A crude representation of a cross rested in its center, though in truth, it looked more like a plus sign than a cruciform; each of its four ends nearly touching the inner circle and terminating in unfamiliar symbols that were vaguely reminiscent of Arabic writing. When I looked closer, I realized in awe that the concentric circles, the cross, and the symbols themselves were all constructed from more of the nearly microscopic text, not solid lines as I had first thought.\n\n“What the fuck is this?” I said to no one in particular, spinning in a slow circle beneath it and trying to discern any of the words. “What was Abigail *doing* down here?”\n\nNick came over, holding his camera up at the symbol and frowning. After a moment, he lowered it and was fiddling with the controls, his face scrunched up in consternation. \n\n“Okay, that’s weird,” he said, and looked up at us. “The camera doesn’t see it. It’s just a blank ceiling – all of it.”\n\nI frowned and looked at the viewfinder he held out to me. He was right, of course; the replay only showed the aged timber of the joists and the floorboards, covered in spiderwebs and streaked with more of that same black mold we’d seen upstairs. “\n\n“What could cause that? Maybe the ink just isn’t showing up in infrared or something? That happens sometimes, right?” Sarah asked, looking down at the display as well.\n\nNick shook his head and I saw that his previous enthusiasm had long since waned – this place wasn’t quite what he had been expecting. “No. I mean, yeah, that can happen, but I’m not using the night vision – I’m lighting it normally. It should see whatever we see.”\n\nThe door at the top of the steps groaned as the wind rose momentarily, and we could almost sense the house above us straining against the storm’s fury. \n\nI looked at my companions and then glanced over my shoulder at the foot of the stairs, the bottom step peeking around the corner at us as if wondering if we were coming back. *Or watching to see what happens to us down here.* “Maybe we’re better off heading back upstairs and saving the cellar for later. Maybe Nat would get a kick out of being the first to really explore it in detail – you know, create more authentic reactions for the camera,” I suggested. To my relieved surprise, Sarah and Nick both nodded their agreement without debate, both looking a little unsettled.\n\nWe turned back in the direction of the staircase and froze, unable to understand what we were seeing at first. Unable to reconcile it with what we had known was real.\n\n*The staircase was gone.*",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever done this before… But my therapist said I should start keeping a journal… Writing down my thoughts, and my feelings, and crap. She said that it should help me sort out my… “confusions.” \n\nI’m 17, I’m not a little kid who dreams too much. I know what I’m seeing, I know what I’m hearing, and I know what I’m feeling. And no amount of telling myself “you just have an overactive imagination, CJ, just go back to sleep,” can save me now. \n\nSo I am going to take Meagan’s advice, and I’m gonna write down everything. That way, when he comes for me, if no one comes to save me… then there will at least be a record of what happened… I’d rather people at least think I’m insane, than think I would EVER abandon my sister, or hurt my family.\n\nLet’s see, it’s… of course it is. \n\n9:00 am\n\nWho knows what is going to happen next, So I should probably get to writing.\n\nHere goes…\n\nMy nickname is CJ, which is short for “Cassian James,” although, I don’t have very many friends… 1 in fact. My little sister, Lily. She’s only 9, but she’s my best friend; and honestly, I think she is the only person on Earth who understands me. We’re not blood related, Dad adopted her about 7 years ago or so. \n\nYou see, I have Autism (and stuff). I lay somewhere deep on the spectrum; inside of the iniquities of Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, Autism, and Schizophrenia; so pretty much everyone treats me like I don’t exist; like I’m not there. I’ve always been seen as a mistake, something to be forgotten, a thing that is supposed to just sort of… sit quiet, and not bother anyone.\n\nAnd I don’t mind much. I stay to myself, read my books, spend time with Lily, and on occasion, will go on adventures in the woods behind my house. I like to hunt for frogs, watch birds, draw, and look at different types of vegetation in the woods… Which is exactly what I was doing when this story really began… when I found… it.\n\nDuring springtime where I live, in rural Upstate New York, there’s a very odd (and mostly disgusting) phenomenon that tends to occur around our and the surrounding counties. An invasive species of fungus, known as “Clathrus Archeri,” makes its rounds in the various dense forests and swampy areas we have around my hometown; Corinth. What is “Clathrus Archeri,” you might ask? Don’t worry, most people don’t really know what it is. It’s also called “Devil’s Finger Fungus,” “Octopus Fungus” or “Octopus Stinkhorn.” \n\nMostly, it’s this disgusting fungus that grows in what looks like a translucent/ opaque “egg,” growing from decomposing vegetation. When it’s ready, it breaks open the “egg” and stretches it’s disgusting, blood-red, octopus-like tendrils out. Then it begins to emit the smell of rotting flesh in an attempt to call over insects (like flies) in order for them to land on it, and spread its spores, which take root and start this process all over again... \n\nThanks to this wonderful attribute of this particularly disgusting plant, Corinth smells like a week old dead body that's been left in the sun, usually from the beginning of April, until the end of June. \n\nIt’s terrible for people who aren’t natives, but have to work here, or drive through, to get to the surrounding counties; however, natives like myself put a mask on, and continue about our lives, mostly unphased. \n\nNow, Octopus Stinkhorn isn’t the only kind of fungi that grows in the many wooded and swampy areas of Corinth. All kinds of mushrooms and plant matter grows here. Corinth is at the very top of a large mountain in Upstate New York; as such, when it’s not winter, and snowy, it’s wet here. And wet is what lots of funguses like. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is go hiking; looking for interesting, delicious, and/or terrifying fungi to capture and take home. You see, my father was a Botanist, so we used to study, cook, and experiment on many different types of fungi together; and my mother is a self-proclaimed psychic and expert Demonologist, who I haven’t gotten to know particularly well, until the last couple of years… So… I have a few interesting hobbies, to say the least. \n\nOh, Dad… Yeah... Dad died, about 9 or 10 months ago... I’m still adjusting. After all, I lived with him, until… well, until he couldn’t take life anymore, I guess? Now me and Lily live with Mom, because Lily had nowhere else to go. Dad was perfectly healthy, and I’m still not sure what happened to him. The coroner said he had died of natural causes, but the man was as healthy as an ox, and was only 40 years old. I guess life is just cruel.\n\nSee, Mom and Dad split when I was 5. At the time, dad said mom was “sick” and had to stay at the hospital to get help. I didn’t see her again until I was 10… That’s when dad explained to me that Mom had had a pretty severe mental breakdown and had tried to kill herself; which ended in her having been catatonic and thought to be brain dead while I was ages 5 through 10.\n\nIt was good to see her again, but she was… different. Quieter, weirder… scarier. Her eyes were duller, darker, and she had deep dark bags under them, as if she was perpetually exhausted. She wouldn’t say a whole lot when we would visit, but she would always give me handwritten letters from her, just about every single time we went there, and tell me to read them when we got home. \n\nThat was always the weirdest part. I don’t know if they were in a different language, or what; because they were entirely unlegible. They were honestly just pages and pages of gibberish, and intensely strange symbols… \n\nAt first I tried to make sense of them, it was kind of fun, almost like a game. But the longer it went on the more frustrating it became… there were no patterns like in speech and most written languages, no repeated characters, or symbols; just lines and lines of gibberish!\n\nAfter a year or so, I just started collecting the letters and putting them in a box in my room. I didn’t have it in me to throw them away. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe my love for my mother, or perhaps it was my pride, that wouldn’t let me let them go; which wouldn’t allow me to throw away something she gave me. I don’t know. I’m not sure.\n\nAnyway, I kept them, and sometimes I would ask her about them, but she never remembered writing them, so she couldn’t tell me what they said, just that I had to have them. \n\nAt first, Dad would take them to make sure there wasn’t anything in them that would be harmful to a child (Dad was weird; he always said “Words are powerful, and can bring you far beyond the limits of your mind.”) but even he said it was nothing but gibberish.\n\nSorry, I got a bit off topic. Well. Sort of. All of this ties back into the story… alright so, Mom started REALLY getting better around when I was 15, or so. And that is when she started to read, like, all the time. Everything she could that was as weird as she could; From the Quran, the Bible, and the Torah, to The Necronomicon, The Ars Goetia, HP Lovecraft’s Library of Insanity, Sarte, Stephen King, Descartes; it didn't matter… \n\nIf it was horror, or had any kind of mythology, theology, or possibility of supernatural or unnatural history in it, she wanted to read it. She would devour every single book on any kind of mythology or demonology or enchantments, magic, and expansive amounts of mythological and theologival lore. This is how she came to be a self-proclaimed “Demonologist.”\n\nThis in turn, according to her, opened up her “third eye,” granting her access to latent “psychic abilities,” and a connection to the “spirit world.” Or so she says. Bunch of insanity if you ask me. But it did instill an interest for mythology and theology in me.\n\nI’m pretty convinced she still isn’t all there, and that something messed her up when she was in the coma… but I’m not a doctor or a priest, so… whatever. Now, as I said before, Dad was a botanist; specifically he ran experiments for the government, on various types of fungi and other rare vegetation. His research was done in the pursuit of knowledge, specifically on how these rare types of Flora can affect the human body, and interact with one another. He liked to say he was a “Master of Mycelium,” and his research was one of the biggest reasons he brought us to back to Corinth. They had grown up together in Corinth, but had moved to Latham, where I was raised, and when dad got his new contract with the government, he was moved back.\n\nI tell you all of this to help explain my eccentricities, and my actions in the following story.\n\nIt was about a week ago, Sunday afternoon, April 21st, after church; and I was outside exploring in the woods, like I normally do. I was following one of the many trails that I’ve made through the woods over the years, and I ended up slipping along a cliff-edge… One that I had never seen before, and I swear doesn’t actually exist; and I fell down about 10 feet or so, hitting my head on a rock, and blacking out.\n\nThe last thing I remember before going unconscious was seeing a bunch of Clathrus Archeri in the area I had landed in, which were beginning to burst from their viscous “egg-sacks” and reach out towards the sky, in order to attract insects and creatures to them, in order to spread their spores. I swore I was in a nightmare horror movie as I passed out.\n\nI’m not sure exactly how long I was out, but the sun had started to set when I came to, so it must have been a few hours at least. Rubbing my head, I found a small amount of blood where I had hit it; and I also saw in the center of all of the creepy tentacle-like fungi, was a slightly larger Octopus Stinkhorn, and it seemed to have been holding on to something.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, my head pounding from when I hit it. I managed to stand up and find my balance, but the world was swimming. I definitely had a concussion… But for some reason I had an overwhelming urge to investigate it. I made my way to the strange fungus in the center of this little clearing, and peeled back the tentacles to reveal what it was holding.\n\nIt was an Egg. It was weird. What was an Egg doing inside of a collection of fungi? My mind was swimming, but for some reason I felt like I needed to take it, so I put my hands on it. It was… warm. Almost pulsating, under my palms. I swore when I made contact it glowed ever so slightly, in a sickly purple glow. I took it and stumbled home, in pain and tired. \n\nLike usual, the apartment was empty… Mom must have taken Lily with her to her stall at the fair, since I wasn’t here to hang out with her. See, because mom fancies herself a “psychic,” she opened a “Fortune Telling Booth,” at the fair that the town runs every weekend; from the start of spring, until the end of summer.\n\nPersonally, I never really understood what people saw in that. I never believed in ghosts, demons, psychics, or the afterlife, all that supernatural stuff was just nonsensical and illogical so I didn’t bother with it. Dad never really talked about that kind of stuff, and he never entertained any of the ideals I would have as a small child of “Monsters” under my bed, or in my closet. He would just say “Knock it off. That’s not funny. Go to sleep.”\n\nSo, I went inside, and felt my way slowly through the house. It hasn’t even been a year of being here yet, so I don’t know my way around in the dark like I did at dad’s house… I found the stairs and made the way up to my room. It's all kind of a blur, but I remember the slight warmth, and the soft purple light coming off of the Egg; not enough to light up the area, but enough to be noticeable. I made it to my room as the world began to spin around me, significantly worse than it was before. The last thing I remember from that night is falling into my bed, and then just muffled darkness until the morning. The strange thing about that night was I could see the slightly pulsating purple light, even when I was unconscious.\n\nI woke up the next morning, but, immediately, I was alarmed. I wasn’t wearing the clothes I had on yesterday; Instead, I was in Pajamas. In addition, the Egg wasn’t on the bed next to me where I collapsed; on the contrary, it was placed on my night stand, standing straight up, as if carefully placed there. \n\nWhen I touched it, it was cold; like metal that had sat outside in the winter, cold; not just room temperature cold. And it wasn’t glowing anymore. In fact, it almost even looked less vibrant… different even, than it had the night before. \n\nI couldn’t remember a lot about what had happened, but I attribute that to the concussion. However, I remember that the Egg was purple, and had scaling patterns on it, like a snake or a lizard, as well as some different types of strange markings, like things I’ve seen in video games before... but now it was just… plain. Purple. Dull… And cold. \n\nAnd my head hurt. A lot. That’s when I noticed there was blood on my pillow, and I rushed to the bathroom to make sure I was okay. I had a cut on my forehead, a knot on the back of my head, and some scrapes and bruises from falling. Aside from a bit of dizziness and a headache, I didn’t have any other issues from the concussion. I took a shower, cleaned myself up, and bandaged my forehead. \n\nAt this point the sun had come fully up, and was pouring into my room through the window, having just began to touch the Egg as I came back into the room, drying my hair with a towel. As the sunlight touched the Egg, it began to slightly glow in response. \n\n“Oh, do you like the light?… or is it the warmth?” I mumbled to myself, while I walked over and pushed the night stand, where the Egg was resting, across the room, over to underneath the window, so it was directly in the sun bath. I could see it slowly pulsate, almost happily, and started to get some of its texture and color back. \n\n“Ah, NOW, you look happier,” I said as I smiled and grabbed my phone, checking the time. 7:30am, Monday, April 22nd. Not terrible. I had no idea what time I had gotten back last night, but it had to have been before 11, since that’s when Mom usually gets home from her stall.\n\nI got dressed, patted the Egg, and went downstairs, to finish getting ready for school. The rest of the week was quiet, as nothing significant happened; until Friday rolled around again, that is…\n\nDay 5 of having the Egg was Friday, April 26th, 2019; and I also had therapy that day. During the week, I had gone and picked up some of those chemical heat packs that get warm when you crack them, and set up a terrarium for the creature in the Egg. \n\nI figured it had to have been some kind of lizard, or bird Egg, that had gotten caught in the clutches of the Devil’s Finger Fungus. I wanted to care for it and see what hatched. I felt a strange attachment to it, now.\n\nBy Friday, it was back to how I had found it; fully textured, with the scales and strange markings, glowing with a purple light, and emitting warmth again. I put the heat lamp on, went to school, anticipating the egg hatching, being mostly distracted all day… and then I went to therapy. \n\nOf course Meagan harped on me about starting this journal, but we did talk about the Egg quite a bit. She said it sounded like a good thing, that it has given me something to focus on, and care for. She said that getting a pet to care for and focus on is a great way to cope with the loss of Dad, and a good first step towards opening myself back up to people, making friends, and being sociable again; but that she had never heard of an Egg like that, so to be careful of what it might contain, in case it’s a dangerous, and/or poisonous/venomous creature. I agreed, but all I could think about was “What COULD be in it???”\n\nI hadn’t let Lily know about the Egg yet, I had wanted to wait for it to hatch and then show her and Mom. She also had soccer, Ballet, and Piano to worry about during the week on top of her own school work, so I decided to just go with the old “Better to ask for Forgiveness, than for Permission,” thing. \n\nI had also begun to feel extremely protective of the Egg, for some reason. So, when I got home from therapy and saw the overhead light was on in my room, when I had turned it off before I left, and just left the heat lamp on; my heart jumped out of my chest. I was anxious, scared, and angry. I felt disrespected, and betrayed. All of these emotions that I never particularly felt or cared about, before. \n\nA side note: I guess part of my Autism is having trouble understanding my own emotions properly, how to feel and process them, and understanding most things normally. Like I don’t understand the notion of “Professionalism” why should I care what I or someone else looks like? I don’t see the difference between a tux and a swimsuit, it’s all fabric, and it’s only purpose is to hide the man-bits and pieces…who cares? Sorry, rambling again. Back to the story.\n\nI ran inside, tore up the stairs, seething, on the verge of tears, and that’s when I saw Lily, standing next to the Egg, very gently brushing it with a soft brush. She turned to me, a big smile on her face, \n“Bubba! You’re home! This Egg is so pretty, I can’t believe you were hiding it fr—” and she stopped mid sentence; and seeing the anger on my face, her joy turned to fear, and her eyes got big and watery, as she began to bawl, and my brain kind of instantly snapped back to reality.\n\nI immediately calmed down, and rushed over to her, hugging her tight. In my soft voice, I said to her:\n“I’m sorry, Lilybear. I didn’t mean to scare you. I wanted to surprise you when the Egg hatched. So when I saw someone was in my room, I got scared that something bad had happened to it. It is pretty, isn’t it? Is that Patty’s brush?” \n\nPatty was her fuzzy white Platypus, and she used a soft doll’s hairbrush to brush her fur.\n\nThe tears stopped rolling down her face, and instead turned into sniffles as I held her tight.\n\n“Y-yes… It’s s-soft and I wanted t-to be gentle and h-help you…” she said in between sniffles. \n\n“I d-didnt w-wanna break your e-Egg. I’m S-Sorry…” she sniffed pathetically and looked at me with big sad eyes.\n\n“I’m sorry, baby girl, I didn't mean to scare you. Honest. Here, I got you gummy bears on my way home.” I took my backpack off and she immediately tackled it out of my hands to search for the gummy bears. \n\n“You’re a fiend.” I chuckled and walked over to the Egg, smiling and gently caressing it. She squealed when she found them and started stuffing them in her mouth. \n\n“So, about the Egg; I had found it in the woods the other day. I was hunting for fungus again, and I fell down into a nest of Clathrus Archeri, and that’s where I found it. Oddly enough it was wrapped up in the clutches of an octopus Stinkhorn, as if it fell and the fungus wrapped around it to protect and consume it.” \n\nI went and sat down on the bed, next to where Lily was sitting on the floor eating her gummy bears, no trace of her previous sadness on her face, only pure contentment. \n\nShe smiled up at me and mumbled through gummy bears “What animal is it?” I chuckled as some chunks of gummy bear fell on the floor. I reached over and grabbed a napkin from the box on my night stand and handed it to her, chuckling.\n\n“Don’t talk with your mouth full, kiddo. Also, THAT, I don’t know. I’ve been trying to figure it out all week. I thought it had to have been a reptile, or a bird of some sort. I don’t know what else could make an Egg that size, but its design and patterns don’t match anything I’ve seen in the books at the library…And I have been checking different books every single day, looking for answers.” \n\nWhen I find something interesting, I almost become robotic… another “symptom,” I guess you could say, of my Autism and ADHD. Hyper Focus, extensive researching, robotic tendencies, and over-explaining everything I find even slightly cool. I know I do it, I just can’t particularly help it. \n\nMost people find it annoying, but like usual, Lily just looked at me and smiled her big bright smile, and said cheerily, “You’re so smart, Bubba. You’ll figure it out, and I’ll help you take care of it! Don’t worry. We can do it together.” \n\nShe nuzzled my arm for a second before she sprung up and started out of the room saying “I’ve got some homework! I’ll see you at dinner.” I smiled and waved as she left. \n\nI was tired. Strangely enough since I had brought the Egg home, it seemed like I had very restless sleep, and I couldnt remember dreaming at all. I thought it may have been a side effect of the concussion, but everywhere I looked online doesn’t say anything about completely losing your ability to dream… \n\nSo, I took a nap until dinner; my head hit the pillow, and I was out like a campfire that had 50 gallons of water dropped on it. \n\nAt around 7:00 pm, I think, since the sun was beginning to go down, I woke up to the sound of my mother yelling my name. When I opened my eyes I was completely awestruck. \n\nThe Egg looked completely different now. It was green and obviously pulsating with light, and it was leisurely wrapped up in these strange tendrils that almost looked like tentacles and/or vines.\n\nAt this rate, the Egg was about the size of a football, as well. It was… enchanting, to say the least; and I felt like the rest of the world got drowned out while I stared at it. \n\nSound disappeared, and I tunnel visioned in on the Egg. I’m not sure how long I stood there, but when I finally came back to full spatial awareness, the sun had completely gone down. \n\nThe glowing from the egg had all but subsided, and I was absolutely exhausted, and starving… The only way I can describe it is that it felt like somebody had just drained my life force. I stumbled down the stairs like a zombie, trying my best to be quiet, so I wouldn’t wake anyone up. Tiptoe-ing through the living room, and into the kitchen. I was so tired, it felt like I was drunk, or delusional, and I swear I kept seeing… something out of the corner of my eye. Some sort of strange shadow.\n\nI was barely there, as I made a sandwich and went back upstairs, as I was eating my sandwich. I sat on the edge of my bed and finished eating, zoning out, as sleep began to creep over me. The last thing I remember, I swear I could hear a small scratching sound, while everything went dark around me.\n\nThat’s the first time it happened. Saturday, April 27th, 3:00 AM. I woke up, sitting straight up, my heart pounding out of my chest. I was terrified, and I didn’t know why… but that’s when I felt it. The pain. Pulsating, radiating, hot… like something crawling under my skin, above my skull but under my scalp. Slowly my hands lifted to touch the area, and that’s when I felt it. These vine-like tendrils, made of plant matter or something like it, digging under the skin of my scalp. \n\nI tried to scream, but nothing came out. I tried to turn my head, and it erupted into fiery, blinding pain. I could feel them dig into my scalp, working their way along my skull towards my eyes. I could feel them crawling into the back of my head through my eye sockets, touching my brain, feeling, probing, absorbing… something. \n\nMy… energy? My… knowledge? I don’t know. But it was excruciating. I cried, silently, frozen in place, suffering… For what felt like years. In reality, it was probably about 3 hours or so, because the tendrils began to recede when the sun began to come up. The excruciating pain and exhaustion I felt, as the tendrils withdrew from my skull, I can only assume is what it feels like when you stick your head into a vat of scolding hot oil, after not sleeping for a year… yeah. It sucked.\n\nI collapsed back onto my pillow, and as the world went dark around me, yet again, the last thing I remember seeing was the vine-like tendrils receding… and wrapping themselves back around the Egg. And that noise again… the scratching noise... But louder this time… \n\n9:00am. My alarm. It sounded like a million nails on a chalkboard. I reached over and slapped the alarm until it quieted down. “Ugh.. Piece of Sh—“ I immediately sat up in my bed remembering the night before, my hands shooting you to the nape of my neck, where I felt… nothing? \n\nYeah I was just as confused as you are. I could have SWORN what I experienced was real; not some strange nightmare. I looked at my pillow, no blood. And the Egg was sitting in the exact position it had been when I went to sleep the first time. The only rational explanation was that I was dreaming. It wasn’t real. Just a really messed up figment of my imagination.\n\nI reached over and patted the Egg, and as I did, I felt it crumble, crunching into a million little pieces beneath my hand. My heart fell into my stomach and made a journey to my groin, and I looked over at the destroyed Egg. \n\nThere was nothing. No yolk, no animals, nothing; just dust and the remnants of the shattered shell. For a brief second I felt sorrow, anger, and confusion all at once, which was a little too much for me to handle. \n\nI immediately began to cry, and I sat alone in my room, curled up in a ball on the bed. I cried, and cried, and cried… and then Lily came in, I could see the urgency on her face as she addressed me, “big brother, what’s wrong?! Why are you crying? Wh—“ she stopped mid sentence as she saw the pieces of the egg shattered on the nightstand, and her face turned to one of sadness and empathy, and she hugged me tight, burying her face in my chest.\n\nNo matter how badly I felt, how broken I was, or how badly I was breaking down, Lily could always bring me back. And she always does. I felt her embrace become tighter and tighter and I could feel my soul being squished back into me, and my breathing beginning to calm down, and my heart beginning to slow. Like magic, her embrace was able to take away the pain.\n\n“I… I broke it, Lil Chipmunk…. I’m sorry. I break everything I touch… I wanted to help this poor animal, I wanted it to help us. I… I miss dad, Lil. I miss him so damn much…” I squeezed her back, and could hear her sniffling, and her little voice as she said “me too, bubs… but we will always have each other. You don’t need to worry about some silly Egg. It’s all gonna be okay.” \n\nWe cried together, and hung out for a while. Despite having slept all night and having that weird nightmare, I STILL felt entirely exhausted. Lily told me to lay back down and rest, and she would clean up my room for me, on the condition that when I get up, I’ll make French toast for her. I chuckled and agreed; she could always make me laugh. I laid back down, and fell asleep to the sounds of her cleaning up my room for me.\n\nWhen I woke up, the clock said noon, and so did the sun outside, shining directly on my face. It wasn’t pleasant, it felt like being hung-over. And I was absolutely hungry. I sat up and stretched, a little sore, a little dizzy, a lot nauseous; and immediately retched into the open garbage can next to my nightstand. \n\nBut it wasn’t vomit. No. No, it wasn’t vomit. Not bile, not partially digested food; no nothing like that. \n\nIt was…. Him. I could feel him, crawling up my throat, reaching for freedom, slithering, suffocating me; forcing his way out… and that’s when he made his debut.\n\nThis… thing. This gelatinous skull with eyes, and tentacles. A truly nightmarish creature; and I saw it, and tried to scream, and as I did it looked right at me, its eyes flashed red, and it was like I was frozen in time. I couldn’t move or scream or breathe. \n\nAll I could do was cry silently as this creature stared at me with its horrific eyes, slowly beginning to move, slipping around with its slimy tentacles. It was like it was staring into my soul, as it pushed itself up on its tentacles, climbing out of the trash can and slowly making its way up my body. \n\nIt stopped to rest on my shoulder, and I could hear the sickening squelching sounds, as its tentacles wrapped around my face, touching, feeling; investigating. Sweat and tears dropped off my face, as it got closer and closer to my ear, and I could feel its disgusting breath against my neck, as it began to speak…\n\n“Ahana ng ah'hri. Yog Say’z’goht. Ymg' ah lw'nafh cahf ephais’tain ya. Un se In’Fhtag Eyan. Ymg' n'gha luln llllnahor, gof'n…” \n\nIt was weird, although I heard the creature speaking in the foreign, guttural language it was speaking, in my head I could hear the words in English; \n\n“Stay calm, human. We are Sau’z’goht. Your life force will sustain us, as your expiration grows nearer. So say the Unsleeping Ones.”\n\nThese words would echo over and over and over in my head, like a broken record, or an occult chant; as I felt this thing begin to claw its way back into my mind, into my skull. Again, the searing pain shot through my head and body.\n\nAnd that’s when I woke up. Covered in sweat, panicked, and achy. It was becoming harder and harder for me to understand when I was dreaming and when I wasn’t; everything just continued to feel wrong. I thought I wasn’t having dreams, but maybe EVERYTHING had been a dream, so far. \n\nI remember being confused and asking myself, “What is happening? Why is this happening? Am I really awake? How do I know if I’m awake?” That’s when I noticed it was dark in my room… I looked at the clock…\n\nIt said “3:00” but that couldn’t be possible, could it? I couldn’t have slept for 18 MORE hours, could I?… \n\nI took my phone out and it said “3:00 AM, Saturday, April 27th.”\n\nHow the hell… that's not possible. That’s when the fear truly set in. The hair raised on the back of my neck; Everything that just happened was a dream? \n\nI looked at the Egg, and it was perfectly intact. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I stood up and walked over to it, gently putting my hand on it. It was radiating its soft green light &amp; warmth, and felt calming to the touch. I guess I was going crazy, or just had the most wild set of dreams, I didn’t know, I didn’t care… I just knew I had to get rid of the Egg. \n\nAll of this weird stuff started happening when I brought it home, and nothing had been quite right, since then. I stopped dreaming, I lost chunks of time; and now, I was losing the ability to tell when I am sleeping or awake. The Egg needed to go. \n\nI picked it up and brought it outside to the garbage can, dropped it in, and shut it. Almost immediately I started feeling better. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a snack to eat, and made my way back up to my room, feeling better than I had all week, smiling, happy. I looked at the clock. \n\n“3:07” \n\nI guess I won, and it worked, since it was gone. I sighed heavily and laid back down, thinking about everything I had experienced. I didn’t know what was real and what was my apparently overactive imagination. Just that it was STILL Saturday morning. I shook my head and decided I’d deal with it in the morning, because I was ABSOLUTEY exhausted. I reached over, and set my alarm.\n\n9:00am. My alarm. It sounded like a million nails on a chalkboard. I reached over and slapped the alarm until it quieted down. “Ugh.. Piece of Sh—“ I immediately sat up in my bed remembering the night before, remembering… that I’ve done this already. But not just last night. The night before. And the night before. And the night before. Ever since I brought that egg home. Somehow, now that I had removed it, certain memories were flooding back.\n\nEvery night. 3:00AM. I’d sit up straight in bed, while the tendrils from the egg would slither and crawl their way over to me, making their way up my body, and clawing into my head. Tearing into my scalp and absorbing my energy?… my knowledge?… I still don’t know. Maybe both... But it doesn’t matter, the point is, that this Egg had been feeding on me for a week already\n\nBut it turns out, I hadn’t lost my ability to dream, whatever that thing was doing to me, it was also blacking it out of my memory. Probably to keep me complacent, and unafraid. Mom says complacency is the work of the Devil, after all. \n\nWait… the Devil… Mom… Could it be? Could mom maybe know about this creature, or thing, and maybe tell me more about it? I rushed out of my room, and went to go find her. \n\nI went down the stairs in my typical clunky, ape-like way, and looked around a bit for her. I ended up finding her in the kitchen, just about to make breakfast. \n\n“Hey, Mom. Good morning.”\n\nMy entire post was too long to get out to you folks. I’ve found that if I don’t leave my room, and I don’t close my eyes, nothing terrible will happen. I’ll wait until tomorrow to upload the part 2 of this story. The time still hasn’t changed from 9:00…",

I managed to stay alive long enough by locking myself in my room and hunkering down in my closet. \n\nI remembered my deal with Lily, and whether that was a dream or not, I wanted to honor it, so I walked over to mom and took the pack of eggs out of her hand.\n\n“Oh, hey kiddo. What’s up?” She smiled, and hugged me as I walked over. “How did you sleep?”\n\n“Not bad” I said as I returned her hug. “Let me make breakfast, I wanna make French toast, and… ask you some questions. Do you mind?” I started going about the process of making French toast, while I explained to her everything that I could remember, up until now.\n\n“…And then last night, I threw the Egg in the trash outside, and that’s when things started to feel better in my head. Do you have any idea what this could be?”\n\nShe had been mostly quiet during my explanation; listening intently, nodding occasionally, but not speaking a word. When I was done she got up and just walked away, not saying anything. \n\nIt made me mad but mom was fuckin weird so, I kind of brushed it off and finished cookin. I called out to Lily that I had made French toast for her, and sat at the table for breakfast.\n\nMom came back down before Lily came out, and set an open sketchbook down in front of me, showing me almost an exact drawing of the creature I had been having experiences with, and another of an Egg; almost exactly like the one I found. In the corner of both drawings, was mom’s scribbled, frantic signature, and a date underneath. Except… the date was when she had tried to commit suicide… 04/07… April 2007\n\nMom spoke for the first time since I started making breakfast. \n“I drew that. From a dream I had. That was on April 26th, 2007… 2 days before… before it happened.” She sighed, and I could see her hands were trembling. I reached over and squeezed her right hand. \n\n“Dad never told me what happened… what really happened, or the exact date... Maybe now is the time?” I looked into her eyes and she looked scared, like she was re-living the worst nightmare of her life. \n\nShe sighed again, her voice shaky, and her eyes beginning to water up. She took a deep breath and said “Okay,” her voice weak and shaking. \n\n“Your father and I have been in love since we were in junior high. We met on the first day of seventh grade, at orientation, when we were just 13. I had just transferred into the middle school from Latham, after I graduated from elementary school… My father had died, and my mother moved us here, to Corinth, because her sister lived here, and it was affordable for a suddenly-single mother…” she took another deep breath as tears began to fall down her face. \n\nI had felt alone, like no one else was missing dad, but now I see that they had been mourning in secret. I could see she could relate to how I have been feeling, having just lost my Dad. In her eyes I could feel, explicitly, her compassion, and sorrow… but there was also something else, that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.\n\n“So, I met your father. And as I’m sure you know, Jaxson was… Unique. He loved flowers, mushrooms, trees, plants, and various forms of botany. He knew what he wanted to be, even then; a Botanist. He was so very smart… but so very stupid. We both were, really; just a couple of sad, stupid kids trying to bend the laws of reality.\n\nYou see, plants, fungi, and botany weren’t the only things that interested your father… While most of his center, and his intelligence, lay within science; he had a very interesting side-pool of knowledge, as well. He knew all about the supernatural, or as he called it, ‘the other side of the coin’.”\n\nIf it was possible, it was almost as if my mom’s eyes became even more dark and down-cast. She wiped away her tears and took a deep breath, steeling her resolve.\n\n“After almost a year, it came to the one year anniversary of the day my dad had died; the date was October 23rd, 1993. The day that would become your birthday, just 9 years later. I was hurting, I was in pain, I was angry… I wanted answers and I wanted my dad to give them to me. \n\nI was talking to your father about all of this, of course, as we had decided to start dating about 5 or 6 months beforehand. His face lit up like I gave him the greatest present in history, and he said 4 words that would come to haunt me, to this day. ‘Let’s have a séance.’”\n\nShe paused for a moment to study my face, but as usual, I was masking; (yay autism) and so my face did nothing to betray my intense interest, worry, and horror at what might happen. She smiled and sniffled, patting me on the head. Then she continued telling her story.\n\n“And so we did. We made a circle of salt, with a star in the center, forming a closed pentagram, and we put bits of the 5 basic physical elements of nature at each point; Fire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Spirit; respectively. \n\nStarting at the top, going clockwise, we put a large lit candle at the top point, and on the next one we put a bowl of purified water. The next point was a pile of soil, and for metal we had bought a block of gallium. That’s when we got to spirit, and I asked your father, \n\n‘How can we represent spirit? That doesn’t seem quite possible.’ \n\nHe smiled and pulled out a bowl… and a knife. My heart dropped, and I stuttered as I asked him what that was for. \n\n“J-Jaxson… i-I don’t think that’s a g-good idea…” That’s when he began to explain it to me, and I don’t know if he ever shared this with you, but your father was just like you, bub. He was incredibly intelligent, and also autistic, so when he launched into an explanation he was almost exactly like you are;\n\n‘In the various books and religious texts I have read, they put a serious emphasis on the importance of blood… Some use it in rituals, some make sacrifices to various gods with it, some say it must never be spilled; and yet still, some say that the spirit is contained within the blood. \n\nSo all we need to do is donate a little blood to the cause right? I don’t mind helping, especially if it means you can see your dad again.’ He kissed me on the forehead, And he raised the knife to his hand, sliced it open, and drained some of his blood into the bowl.”\n\nShe stopped for a second, shaking her head, and chuckling.\n\n“Your father was brilliant, he truly was; but even at the ripe age of 14, I swear he was absolutely insane, sometimes. He wrapped his hand up with bandages he had brought, and smiled at me and said, ‘If you’re ready, it’s your turn.’ And handed me the knife.” As she told this part of the story, she began rubbing the palm of her right hand, and I could tell she was re-living the pain of what came next.\n\n“I knew I had to, I knew I didn’t have much of a choice, if I wanted to see my dad again; so I just went ahead and copied him. I cut my hand and let some of my blood drip into the bowl. That was the first time I could see how much your father loved me, because when I looked into his eyes, I saw nothing but care, love, and concern, as he bandaged up my hand for me.” She sighed and smiled, nostalgia heavily on her face.\n\nMom was apparently a really good story teller, because I couldn’t hide my intrigue and horror any more; and she could tell, a coy smile on her lips.\n\n“And so we continued with the séance. We sat inside the circle, said the magic words, and no, I’m not gonna tell you what those are; And then we waited. About 10 mins went by and absolutely nothing happened. I sighed and felt defeated, but I hugged your father and thanked him nonetheless. \n\nAs I reached up to kiss his cheek, all of the lights went out, including the candle, and I screamed for a second, but your father put his hand over my mouth, and excitedly began speaking to whatever was there.\n\n‘Hello from the living side of reality. I hope the other side of the coin is doing well. We have contacted you in an attempt to speak with Vera’s father, who passed away recently. Are you Bruce?’ Your father spoke with confidence, gusto, and strength. I had never seen him like that before.\n\nThe entity did not answer, and instead, it was like a bomb went off in the room. The books on the shelves flew across the room, loose papers were thrown around like snowflakes. The bed and desk overturned, and a massive white flash went off, all at once. \n\nI’m not sure how long we were both out, but when we came to, there was an Egg. Exactly like the one you’ve told me about. We didn’t know what to do with it, we didn't know what it was, or where it had come from.\n\nI decided to just hold on to it, and for a week I ‘didn’t dream’ just like you. I woke up to the tendrils in my skin, just like you. We tried to break it open, we tried to put it in the fire, we even tried to throw it out the window, and we didn’t even dent it!\nEventually we took it deep into the woods, up here in Corinth, and we buried it…”\n\nShe stopped again, sighing, wiping her face from crying, and taking a big, deep breath.\n\n“And everything stopped once the egg was buried. We decided to forget about it, write it off as a crazy experience, and never mention it to anyone again. No more seances, no more supernatural talk, nothing, as we had decided we really shouldn’t be pushing the boundaries of our world. We thought all was done, and fine, and finished… \n\nThat is, until next spring rolled around… That’s when the Clathrus Archeri began to grow here. It couldn’t have been a coincidence, it’s just not possible. This weird, alien…THING, must have come from that Egg. The fungi never hurt anyone, or became much of a danger; other than becoming a part of the natural ecosystem, and stinking up the town every year…”\n\nI could see the regret and pain on her face, as she told her story. While it’s hard for me to understand and sort through my own emotions, and it is difficult for me to people, it’s pretty easy for me to spot emotions IN people. As if those who wear masks to cover their emotions around me are in fact bearing their heart on their sleeves. Anger, pain, and sadness, especially, are easy to detect in people.\n\n“I love you, mom. I know how it feels to fall victim to this thing… But remember. It's not your fault. It has some kind of mind control powers, and we have both fallen victim to them. It’s in the garbage now, so I don’t care much… Hey where’s Lily?” It was then I realized that mom and I had been talking for 15 or 20 minutes, and Lily still hadn’t come out of her room. \n\n“I’m not sure… Why don’t you go check on her and I’ll make you both plates.” She responded, as I nodded and walked to the back of the house, where I knocked on her door, saying\n\n“…Hey, Lil? You okay? It’s been like 20 minutes since I finished making breakf—” I stopped mid sentence as I pushed against her door… it was locked. No. The doorknob turned, but the door didn’t budge. It wasn’t locked… it was blocked. Why was it blocked? Lily is 9. For a second my heart started beating out of my chest as I began to panic and bang on the door, screaming her name over and over, and the door still wouldn’t budge. \n\nLily’s room is connected to the backyard, and leads directly to the back porch, so my mind started racing about all of the scenarios that she could be hurt, kidnapped, dead… I ran past mom, out the front door, and around the side of the house, bursting through the door into the back yard. As I rounded the corner to where Lily’s room was when I first saw it.\n\nThat entire side of the house was wrapped in slimy, vine-like tendrils, exactly like the ones I remember from that disgusting creature in my… dream? Was I dreaming again? At that second I didn’t care, all I could think about was Lily’s safety. I ran up to the glass doors that lead into her room, and I could see through a small section of them that wasn’t covered in slimy tentacles.\n\nI could see her TV on. I could see the tentacles writhing in the room, but it was dark. I screamed her name as loudly as I could, and it must have paid off because the next thing I saw was a little hand shoot up out of the writhing mass of tendrils. She could hear me. \n\n“LILY! GET TO THE DOOR!” I could see her little hand struggling to pull herself up and out. I could see she was crying, panicking, and covered in slime and bruises. My body took over and I turned around, grabbing the entire grill from the porch and smashing it against the glass doors until they shattered open, then tentacles pouring out, along with Lily, who had made her way to the door. I scooped her up, and ran back around the house, running in the front door and started to yell for my mom.\n\nShe was sitting in the same place I had left her, and I started explaining to her that we had to go, that the creature was back, and was taking over the house. She stared at me blankly for a second before she smiled and said,\n\n“CJ… don’t you want to hear the rest of my story?” Her voice sounded strange. Almost… deeper. Huskier. It was scary. I shook my head, saying,\n\n“Mom, not now. What the hell? We have to go, do you not understand that that thing is back, and trying to kill us?!”\n\nShe responded “It’s too late for all that, sweetie.” And that’s when I saw the vines had wrapped around the front of the house… and we were trapped. \n\n“Mom… what’s going on?”\n\nShe spoke, her voice deep… demonic even, “Sit, boy. And listen to the story.” Her eyes flashed red. Just like the creature’s eyes did in my dream… Lily was in my arms, crying, and she looked up at me, terrified. \n\nI smiled at her and kissed her forehead, “It’s alright baby girl… I won’t let you get hurt.” My gaze shifted to my mom. Green slime was oozing out of her ears, and her eyes, like she was crying this strange stuff. It was horrifying. But I went over and sat down across from her, cradling Lily, and stared her directly in her eyes, which at this point had turned an inky black, the ooze steadily streaming from her eyes.\n\n“Fine. Finish your story.” I spat the words at her like venom. Trying as hard as I could to be brave and defiant, and not betray the massive amount of fear in my heart at that moment\n\nShe grinned, unnaturally wide, as the skin on her cheeks almost split, the smile stretching quite literally from ear to ear, almost like a horrifying nightmare. Deep red blood dripped from her mouth, as she began telling another story.\n\n“So, as I was saying, that was the day that would become your birthday, just 9 years later. We never tried another séance, and your father respected me enough to leave it alone. I apparently didn’t respect myself that much, though. That next April was the first time the Clathrus Archeri showed up here in Corinth, and it was… absolutely enchanting to me. When that egg was manipulating me, it somehow changed me. I found the odor of the Devil’s Fingers Fungus pleasing… almost… erotic.” She cackled a deep and guttural laugh, cracking her neck in a nearly unnatural way; and at this point, no part of me thought she wasn’t possessed. \n\n“One day, to be exact, April 28th, 1994, ((I thought to myself: “There it was again. April. Specifically the 28th. What the hell?”)) Your father walked me home from school, and then went home, himself. I was trying to do my homework at the kitchen table and the window was open. The Clathrus Archeri were in full bloom, and the smell was beginning to overpower me, the allure was too strong, and I found myself being led out of the house, and deep into the woods, by this enchanting smell.” She licked her lips and more blood dripped down her chin, hitting the wooden table and sizzling slightly.\n\n“That’s when I came across an almost entirely overgrown clearing, just chock-full of The Octopus Fungus, and at its center… The Egg. And I walked to it, and fell to my knees. I grabbed it, lifted it up…. And it grabbed me back. The vines wrapped around my arms and my throat and forced itself into my mouth, and down my esophagus. It felt like my throat was going to burst at the seams, but somehow it got down… and that’s when I heard His voice for the first time. When the symbiosis began.”\n\nLily continued to sob in my arms, she was bleeding from her head and left leg, and I gently pet her hair to try and soothe her. I then spoke up for the first time in a while.\n\n“So… those ‘magic words’… and this entity…” my brain was moving at Mach speed, as I started stringing it all together… \n\n“You’re not my mom. You’re that thing… you’re… Sau’z’goht. The Unsleeping Ones.” I tripped over the words, my voice shaking, as the realization of what I was going up against came to me. \n\nThe language it had spoken before sounded familiar to me, I’ve heard a few of the words before. Well, not heard, but read. In a book that is SUPPOSED to be fictional. The Necronomicon, a collection of stories by H.P. Lovecraft. This creature was some kind of Eldritch Terror. \n\nIt had to be, nothing else made sense. Lovecraft wasn’t a brilliant artist; he was a tortured man, who could see a plethora of Interdimensional creatures. His books were his attempts at warning us. At telling us what to look out for. And here I was. About to be its victim and portal into the world. \n\n“Well, you are a smart one aren’t you?” My mom…. No… the creature, Sau’z’goht… cackled, spraying blood across the table, and Lily screamed and hid her face in my chest. It continued to talk,\n\n“Indeed, that was when your mother and I finished our Synchronization. We never could quite get to 100%, as a tiny part of her has been inside here, fighting to get out, for over 25 years. Here and there, she does manage to come out, though. For instance, April 28th, 2007. She managed to surpress me for just 5 minutes. And that’s all she needed. \n\nShe managed to take every pill in the cabinet, and slit her pathetic wrists. As you know, she damn near died; if I hadn’t forced her body to walk us to the hospital, despite its condition, she would have succeeded at killing us both.” The creature spit a wad of blood onto the table, and it sizzled like acid, looking disgusted, before it continued.\n\n“After that, she was able to fight me for about 10 more years, half of which she managed to suppress me by keeping her body in a catatonic state, and the other half she fought me with all she had, leading to her mental state, when you began to visit her again. Insane. Or at least, seemingly. It’s a good thing you never took the time to study, and try to translate all of those ‘letters’ she gave you… but your father did.” The creature began to laugh, deep, slowly, and maniacally.\n\n“Yes, good old Jaxson. He never gave up trying to figure out what happened to her. And he finally cracked it in the end, there. He managed to translate her insane ramblings, her foreign language, and the writings she kept giving you. He figure it all out, and he was studying, and preparing to destroy me. So… I got him first. And let me tell you children…” it slammed moms hand ms on the table so hard we heard the bones in her hand splinter, and blood began pouring from the top of her nails. \n\n“He was delicious.”\n\nLily screamed, and I kicked the table at the creature as I ran up the stairs, with her in my arms. She hugged me tight, sobbing into my chest, and as I threw the door to my room open and walked in, slamming it behind me as I turned around… She was gone. And my room was spotless. There were no oozing tentacles wrapped around the windows, or the pulsating heartbeat sound I could hear while downstairs with the creature. But most importantly, my eyes shot right to the clock…\n\n9:00am… What the fuck. I spun around again and opened the door, and standing there was Lily, looking startled and concerned for me. \n\n“Bubba… are you ok?” As if NOTHING had just happened.\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore, I just screamed as loud as I could. I slammed the door, locked it, sat down here, and began writing all of this down. I don’t know what’s happening anymore… and that chanting was back… very quiet, at first… but increasing in volume with each pass of the guttural statement that creature made.\n\nMy phone still says Saturday, 9:00am, but there’s no way I’ve written this entire thing in less than 1 minute… and even more concerning… It's night time outside. I’m gonna upload this to the web, so if this isn’t a dream, maybe somebody will come and save me. If not… maybe I’m already dead, and this is just Hell. \n\nI can hear the whispers, I can hear the scratching, I can hear them begging to let them in, not just into my room, but into my mind, my body, and my soul. The Unsleeping Ones…. Sau’z’ghot… it just keeps repeating and getting louder and louder…. It’s driving me insane.\n\n“Ahna ng ah'hri. Yog Sau’z’goht. Ymg' ah lw'nafh cahf ephais’tain ya. Un se In’Fhtagn Eyan. Ymg' n'gha luln Iillna’hor, gof'n… Ahna ng ah'hri. Yog Sau’z’goht. Ymg' ah lw'nafh cahf ephais’tain ya. Un se In’Fhtagn Eyan. Ymg' n'gha luln Iillna’hor, gof'n… Ahna ng ah'hri. Yog Sau’z’goht. Ymg' ah lw'nafh cahf ephais’tain ya. Un se In’Fhtagn Eyan. Ymg' n'gha luln Iillna’hor, gof'n… \n\n“Un se In’Fhtagn Eyan…. So say the Unsleeping Ones.”\n\nPlease, God, Help Me…\n-CJS\n\nP.S. since I’ve managed to stay alive so far, I might try to get to the attic and get the boxes I kept all the letters mom wrote to me. Maybe there’s more information there.\n\nIf I survive, I’ll post a part 3 and any updates. Thank you guys for giving me hope, since I have a connection to the outside world, now. 🙏🖤🤍",

        "text": " \n\nThe defeat that I had felt at being told that I had not been picked for the internship at the biology lab was quickly quelled by the note at the bottom saying that it wasn't because I wasn't qualified, but merely because the two spots available were taken by the only two applicants that were more qualified than I was, and that since they even liked me during the interview they had forwarded my application to another lab across town that had one spot open.\n\nI hadn't even heard of Pierrimay Biology lab before I read the name in the rejection email, but apparently that was who had my application letter now. I looked up the organization's name on google and apparently it was an actual thing. After a quick browse through their website to learn all I could about them and stalking key figureheads of the company on linkedin, I figured it couldn't hurt to make the trek across town to personally introduce myself. If they only had one spot left I didn't want to be the person whose application got tossed in the trash because they couldn't be bothered to make the effort.\n\n“Initiative.” That's what all of the youtube videos I'd looked up said. \"Take the initiative, and you can't go wrong.\" Besides, if this internship turned out to be a permanent gig upon my graduation I wouldn't complain. In fact it may even give me the push to bother graduating at all. I had been thinking about taking a break and heading out east to Virginia to take a mental vacation away from familiar things.\n\nI was one of those people who didn't even decide what I wanted to major in until I had been accepted to college. The community college that I ended up in had an array of focuses, neither of which grabbed my attention any more than the other, so I just went with the one that sounded like it had the highest chance of me receiving female attention, so I picked something that sounded smart.\n\nI told my mother that if she let me use her car to drive to the lab I would fill the gas tank on the way home. Usually I had to plead to use the car during the week, but in this case that was all she needed to hear in order to yield to my request.\n\nThe lab itself, although technically in the city, was as far out towards the border of town as possible, right next to the southern road that led to the next town about nine miles away. The building was tall, being around twenty to twenty five stories in height. In fact it looked like the type of building that would be found in the heart of the city itself, rather than the outskirts. Pulling into the parking lot my heart already sank. Having to get here from home on a regular basis would be an absolute nightmare. Especially since the nearest bus would dump me more than a mile away.\n\nNow even more jaded about the circumstance that required me to be here, I parked near the front gate and walked up to the building. The front of the entrance was a large glass window that displayed the white and orange lobby. A help desk sat in the middle, where a woman sat. I approached the door and pulled. It was locked. I stepped up to the door next to it and pulled it as well. That door too was locked. The woman at the desk watched me try another door before she pushed the button on the intercom next to her.\n\n\"They're all locked.\" Her voice came from an overhead speaker. I looked up.\n\n\"Can you... unlock it... please?\"\n\n\"Do you have an appointment?\"\n\n\"N- uh yes.\"\n\nThere's a long silence. She puts her elbow on the desk and rests her cheek on her fist. \"Guess I’ll just pretend like I didn't hear you almost say 'no' before you said 'yes'?”\n\n\"Look, my name is Russ Attley, I was emailed that my internship application was forwarded here and I just wanted to come and speak with... um-\" I had forgotten the name of the hiring manager that I looked up on LinkedIn. \"Jean... Hen... der... son.\"\n\n\"Jean Jimenez?\"\n\n\"Yup. That guy. I was informed that I should speak with him.\"\n\nHer eyes dart away thoughtfully. She leans over and picks up a phone. After a few seconds she begins to speak into it. With the speakers off I couldn't hear what she was saying and her neutral facial expression gave nothing away. After nearly a minute she covers the receiver with her hand and pushes the intercom button again. \"Okay Russ, who exactly sent you here?\"\n\n\"NTW Cardita.\"\n\nShe puts the phone back to her ear and I can see her lips repeat what I just told her into the phone. After another brief period she hangs up the phone, reaches over and pushes another button. A loud buzzing sound startles me and I step back from the door. Even without the intercom on I can hear the woman's laugh through the doors.\n\n\"Pull the door when you hear the loud scary buzzer,\" She says, still not entirely composed from her laughter. The buzzer goes off again and I pull the door.\n\n\"Please wait right over there,\" She says, pointing to the row of chairs along the adjacent wall. I obey her command and sit on the chair at the end. I look around the entrance. The walls were composed of white tiles with yellow tiles sporadically dotted in at random intervals. Although clearly a modern building I couldn't help but get an old 1970s vibe from the ambiance. Even the chairs were those neon colored red, green, and yellow ones with the cupped seats that if you sat all the way back in for too long you'd likely need spinal reconstructive surgery.\n\nThe double doors quickly swinging open snapped my attention to the man entering the scene. \"Where's our visitor?\" He asks cheerfully. Before he has even finished speaking the woman points at me from the counter. He turns to his left. \"Oh there you are.\"\n\nI shoot to my feet and raise a hand. I immediately recognized him to be Jean, the hiring manager that I had looked up on LinkedIn.\n\n\"Hi I'm-\"\n\n\"Russ,\" he finishes my sentence for me. \"Yes. We actually got your recommendation and the application. Look, I'm going to be fairly candid here. We weren't really looking for someone who was currently a student. We were hoping for a more... permanent arrangement. Our recent vacancy *is* entry level, but the request we submitted wasn't exactly in the grain of internship level. We actually need someone that has at least some experience.”\n\nFor a few seconds I'm at a loss for words. Before the silence gets too awkward Jean speaks, “How bout this though-\"\n\n\"I can work part time hours, and you don't have to pay me.\" I blurt out.\n\nI can hear a wheeze come from the front desk. Neither Jean nor I pay attention to it. We are both locked into a staring contest. I can tell that he's trying to figure me out. For me it wasn't about their pay. Not yet anyway. I needed the experience. This way I could avoid hitting the wall of \"Your resume looks great but x amount of years of experience are needed for this position,\" down the line.\n\nJean rubs the corner of the bridge of his nose with his thumb.\n\n\"That's honestly better than what my idea was gonna be. And you're actually the only applicant, so… Follow me.\"\n\nAnd that's how I got the internship at the Pierrimay Biology lab. My hours were from three to eight PM From Monday to Wednesday. Sometimes my mother would let me use her car to get there, but on most occasions I had to take the bus to the nearest stop and then speed walk the final mile to the lab.\n\nAfter five weeks I even started getting paid. Not great, of course, but enough to more than make up for the fast food server gig that I had quit to accept the internship. \n\nPierrimay Biology lab was not partnered with the college so I had to make a plea to ensure that the experience I gained from the internship would be acceptable as a requirement for the additional credits. The request was still in the approving process more than a month into the job. It was around that time that we got the submission from downstate.\n\nThe Pierrimay lab was quite unconventional when it came to how exactly the job was practiced. At least it was unconventional where I was placed. On the West wing of the eleventh floor, where I worked, we specialized in investigating submissions of “rare and unusual” specimens that were reported in what was called RFR tickets. \"Request For Review\" is what I was told that meant. Basically Stanley, my coworker, would get an inbox message from either a peer lab that wanted input on a specimen, or a random farmer who thought that they had discovered a new species of Killer Spider Bat Bee Pigs and was requesting they they be able to send in a frozen paw, leg, or snout of some poor critter they had shot out in the deep woods. The latter always came with the request that if it was a new undiscovered creature, that they would get to be the one to name it.\n\nI once asked Stanley why we didn't just ignore those types of requests. He just shrugged.\n\n\"You never know,\" he said. “You'd be surprised at the things we haven't seen yet.”\n\nOur newest submission was exactly one of these types of requests. However there was a slight deviation to the norm. This RFR ticket was someone asking if we had yet reviewed the sample that had been sent weeks earlier, and if we either had an answer to the question they asked last time, or would be willing to venture out to the environment that the sample had been taken from.\n\nI hovered around behind Stanley as he read the message on his computer.\n\n\"You gonna look at it?\" I ask.\n\n\"Probably not. If it's an old sample we probably looked at it already and it was probably something already discovered or a hoax. We get some of those too sometimes.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, a little disappointed. The only times I really got to look at samples was when an RFR ticket was decided to be worth looking into, or on the off occasion where I got to look at something before it was sent off to be torched.\n\nI go back to my desk and sigh loudly. I had just about done all of the jobs I needed to do for the day and eight was still nearly two hours away. I pull out my phone and begin to browse through some memes. \n\n\"You finish torching those Amphibia Anura samples?\" Stanley asks.\n\n\"Yes,\" I say, and keep scrolling. I let out another loud sigh.\n\nStanley has begun rapping his fingertips on his desk, as he clicks through his inbox. After a few more seconds of silence I let out one last loud, exasperated, insufferable sigh.\n\n\"God! Okay we'll look at the sample!\"\n\nI hop up from my chair and grab my jacket. \"Thank you!\"\n\nOn the ninth floor. We open the door to the cold room. Here the samples were kept in drawers that lined the walls in a manner not too dissimilar to the layout of a morgue. However these drawers varied in size. The range went from no larger than six square centimeter pocket drawers, to some that were over four square feet. Stanley picks up one of the clipboards on the wall. After scanning through it he puts it back in its place and picks up another.\n\n\"We're looking for Ma-016.\" He puts that clip board down, and walks to the other side of the room that had more clipboards hanging on the wall.\n\n\"You guys looking for something specific?\" A voice directly behind me in the doorway asked, and I spun around.\n\n\"Allie was the one who mainly kept the record of all of the samples in the cold rooms.\n\n\"Ma-016\" Stanley and I both say. \n\nShe thinks for a moment. \n\n\"Torched,\" She says finally. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that was Henry's last analysis job.\"\n\n\"Henry?\"\n\n\"Who's Henry?\" I ask.\n\n\"Our last new guy. The person whose job you have now.\"\n\n\"He's the one who left?\"\n\n\"Quit. He quit. Just cleared out his desk one day and never came back. \n\n“What did the report say about the sample?\"\n\n\"He didn't make one.\"\n\n\"That's kind of-\"\n\n\"Against policy,\" Allie said. \"Yeah I know. The lazy hellion doubled my work for three days because of that. Don't tell Vincent. I kind of just left the whole situation alone, I'm swamped as it is.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Stanley starts. \"We got another RFR ticket about Ma-016 and we have no record of it being reviewed, we can ask for a resubmission from the requester.\"\n\n\"Ah, well that is the precise part where this no longer becomes my job. You gentlemen have fun.\" Allie practically jumps out of the room. Her footsteps can be heard fleeing down the hallway.\n\nStanley and I just stare at the door for a few seconds. I finally break the silence with my question.\n\n\"Are we going to have to report this to Romelli?\"\n\n\"We're probably going to have to report this to Romelli.\"\n\nVincent Romelli was the director of the labs. He was regularly in the building but I only saw him about once a week. If even that. His office was on the seventeenth floor. I'd only been up there once in the first week, and then never again. Sometimes he would make the rounds to the different labs on the lower floors to check in, though. He’d nod. I’d nod back. He’d leave and I'd go about my business.\n\nWhen Stanley knocked on the door I did my best to not look like I was hiding behind him when we heard the voice within the room tell us to come in.\n\n\"Mr. Romelli-\" Stanley started, \"We have an issue that we are wondering how to proceed with. It's about Henry's last analysis.\"\n\n\"What about Henry's last analysis?\"\n\n\"He didnt record it, and he torched the sample. The ticket requester that sent in the sample is asking if we've looked into it yet, and that it's urgent. He even wants us to go down to Bakeswoods to conduct a field survey. I was going to tell him we only do that after an analysis has displayed something that is worth looking further into but... well we don't even know anymore what came up from that sample.\"\n\nMr Romelli takes his time digesting Stanley's report.\n\n\"We could always request that he send another sample, I guess.\"\n\n\"No, that won't be necessary. You can conduct the field review.\"\n\nThere's another long pause.\n\n\"Me? Conduct? Without team two?,\" Stanley says confused.\n\n\"Team two is in Kasabonika. Like you said, the full field analysis team doesn't get sent out unless we have a report for them to go off of. It looks like you're going to have to go and get them a report. If it's nothing, which it may be, then at least we didn't waste the whole team's time.\"\n\n\"B- well uh... Okay. I- should I... gather a different team... or-\"\n\n\"Who's that standing behind you?\"\n\n\"Hi I'm Russ,\" I said as if he didn't know my name. Actually, he might not have.\n\n\"Russ is your team now,\" Mr Romelli Instructs, with a dismissive wave of his hand.\n\nStanley turns and looks at me.\n\n\"He's an intern, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can still be of use.\" I shrug. The thought of being able to do my job out where actual samples are being collected rather than just analyzing them in a dry windowless lab seemed like a great deal.\n\nStanley messaged the requester that we would be willing to go down to the site that the sample was gathered from in order to survey the area and determine whether or not the specimen was something that had yet to be classified. Although Thursday was not a day that I was usually scheduled to work on, that was the day that Stanley and our new client had agreed upon.\n\nThat Thursday, when I got to the lab, Stanley was in the front parking lot loading gear into the company van.\n\n\"Didn't think you were coming.\"\n\n\"I told you, I don't get out of class until four on Thursdays.\" I had originally hoped that the field survey would be done on one of my work days so I wouldn't have to worry about coming in on an extra day of the week. Unfortunately that wasn't how things panned out. That added to the fact that it was an overnight survey, and I would have to still go to class the next morning dampened my attitude even more. Just thinking about how exhausted I would be the next morning already made me tired.\n\n\"That's the last one.\" Stanley points to a duffel bag at my feet. \"Toss it in and let's go.\" He walks around to the driver side of the van and gets in. I toss the duffel bag into the back and then jog over to the passenger side and hop in.\n\n\"How far are we going?\" I ask.\n\n\"South to Bakeswoods. Probably Two hours.\"\n\n\"Alright. I'm going to sleep, then.\" I let my seat back and pull my cap down over my eyes. I had to get as much sleep in as I could since I'd likely be awake for the next twenty four hours.\n\nIt felt like mere minutes after I had shut my eyes that Stanley was poking me in the head to wake me up. I sat up. \n\n\"We here?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Come on.\"\n\nI step out into the dirt road and look around.\n\n\"This isn't a farm.\"\n\n\"Bakeswoods isn't a farm. It's a forest. A hunting ground.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" I say. I look down the road that we came. The road to Bakeswoods was a long hill that led from what looked to be a town about three or four miles down. A bright light from behind made us turn our attention back up the hill. A car with its high beams on slowly approached, stopping thirty feet away. The door opened and a man hopped out. \"You with the lab?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yessir!\" Stanley called over.\n\n\"Good. Honestly if it got any darker I was just going to head back into town.\"\n\n\"Stanley.\" Says Stanley, and he offers his hand to the man who shakes it. \"This Here is Russ.\"\n\nI shake the man's hand. He introduces himself as Jerry.\n\n\"I'm glad they sent two of you this time. I didn't go along with the other guy last time, when I came back in the morning I saw the car was gone so I knew he headed out, but I was hoping he'd tell me what he found.\"\n\n\"This... ti- uh someone came out before?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the blonde guy. Short beard. I think his name was-\"\n\n\"Henry?\"\n\n\"Yeah! Yeah that's it. Did he tell you anything when he got back?\"\n\nStanley looks at me clearly confused.\n\n\"You said he came alone? Without a field team?\"\n\n\"Yeah he said he looked at what I sent in and he wanted to get a survey of the field that I got it from.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me what exactly you sent in?\"\n\n\"What, you don't know? It was the underwing of the thing. Right under the arm. I shot it and it ran off. I came back the next day with some friends and found the piece I shot off just lying out in the clearing.\"\n\n\"Can you take us to the spot?\" Stanley asks.\n\nJerry looks at his watch and makes a face.\n\n\"I'll take you to the entrance of the forest close to the area, and point you guys in the direction, but I'm gonna head back into town right after.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nWe get back into our vehicles and Stanley follows Jerry about a mile down the road. Surrounded by the forest on both sides. We could no longer see the town from here. When Jerry stops his car and hops out he points to the side of the forest on the right. \n\n\"Half a mile down that way there's a river that me and my brother go fishing in sometimes. On the other side of the river there's a shack. It's been there for as long as I can remember. If you see the river and the shack, you're in the right area.\" With that Jerry gets back into his car and drives back down the road toward the town.\n\n\"Underwing?\" I say. \"So it's a bird.\"\n\n\"Guess so.\" Stanley is unloading the gear from the van. He tosses me a backpack and I put it on. He grabs a duffel bag and slings it over his shoulder, slams the back of the van shut and heads toward the forest. I hurry closely behind.\n\n\"How many field analysis jobs have you done?\" I ask.\n\n\"A lot. Most of them are a waste of time. At least the local ones. The good ones are off continent. That way even if the job itself is a waste of time you're at least in a new place. Some field surveys can be like little vacations if you're lucky.\"\n\n\"And the good ones? The ones that aren't wastes of time?\" I ask.\n\n\"Most recent one was in South America. Ever Heard of Rio Lawa?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"It's a river that separates Suriname from French Guiana. Some thrill seekers trekking along it thought they discovered some unknown species of spider. They mashed one and sent it in. It was deemed worth sending out a group to look at them in the field. I was sent along with them.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Turns out it wasn't a new species but a mutated version of an already discovered species. There was only one family of those mutated spiders in that one spot of the river that bordered two countries. It was the strangest thing. Anyway the whole job took less than a week. We wrote the report and came back. You can read it when we get back.\" Stanley pauses and turns his head to the side.\n\n\"Sounds like running water,\" I say.\n\n\"Indeed it does,\" He says, and we quicken our pace.\n\nThe sun had already disappeared beyond the horizon and the last remaining morsels of light were quickly following behind it. The thick forest soon amplified the darkness to extremes I wouldn't have thought possible. With the moon nowhere in sight we had to use flashlights just to see the ground.\n\nWhen we got to the river we set our bags down in the tree line so that we could set up in the cover of the brush without being seen by whatever animals came to drink from the stream.\n\nStanley and I took out the camera setups to set around the perimeter so that we could capture any and everything that happened in the area.\n\n\"What exactly are we hoping to catch with these?\" I ask, once we've set up the seventh camera.\n\n\"Based on the tickets, some sort of nocturnal bird. Large, red, smart, fast.\" Stanley is setting up the viewer in between the tree and the tent he had set up.\n\n\"Want me to set up the rest of the cameras?\" I ask looking into the bag. There were three left.\n\n\"No. What we got's good. Don't want to clutter the viewport.\" He opens a foldable chair, props it up in front of the screen, then sits down.\n\nI idle next to the tree taking in the surroundings. Our set up is close enough to the river to see it if we peek through the brush, yet concealed enough to hopefully not be seen by anything that would approach the river for a drink. Beyond the stream I could just make out the small shack that Jerry was talking about. When we set up a camera up in a tree near the shed earlier I attempted to open its door but a rusty padlock put a stop to it. It was an average sized shack of about six feet tall. At the top there was some sort of crested parabolic shape that slightly swayed in the wind. I squinted at it trying to make out any features of it but the distance and darkness obscured it.\n\nI turn my attention from the clearing.\n\n\"Did you bring another chair?\" I ask Stanley.\n\n\"Nope.\" he says without taking his eyes off of the screen.\n\nI lean my back against the tree, and slide into a sitting position.\n\n\"Soooo... this is it then? We just wait until one of the cameras picks up something?\"\n\n\"Yup. Oh! Here you might want this.\" Stanley leans back and hands me something. Whatever it is, it's metallic and reflects the light of the screen in front of him. I grabbed it. It's a knife.\n\n\"A knife? For... what exactly?\"\n\n\"We're in the forest at night. There might be bears.\"\n\n\"You and I both know this knife isn't going to do anything to a bear.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but at least you'll go down fighting. A futile fight, but a fight.\"\n\n\"Could have at least given me a gun,\" I mutter.\n\n\"Oh, okay here.\" Stanley reaches into his sweater pocket and pulls out a pistol. I nearly jumped back at the sight of it.\n\n\"Whoa woah Woah!\"\n\n\"Here, take it.\" Stanley pushes it to me and I recoil.\n\n\"No, I don't want it.\"\n\n\"You said you wanted it. Here, take the gun.\"\n\n\"I don't want the gun, you can keep the gun I was joking. Sheesh.\" \n\nStanley chuckles and puts it back into his sweater pocket. He turns his attention back to the screen.\n\n\"You like beer?\" He asks.\n\n\"I'm nineteen.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. That's a yes, then?\"\n\nI shrug. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"Yeah me too. I probably should have brought some with us.\"\n\nI collapse backward into the grass with a sigh. Stanley is practically wheezing with laughter.\n\n\"Is this what I'm going to have to put up with all night?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" He answers.\n\nI lay there staring up at the tree branches above. The trees were still and silent.\n\nStill and silent.\n\nI cock my head to the side. The trees were not swaying. In fact there was no wind to sway the trees at all. I hop to my feet.\n\n\"Was the wind blowing before?\" I ask Stanley.\n\n\"Uh... I don't know. it's not blowing now.\"\n\nI walk over to the tree that borders the clearing to the river and I peek beyond it. A prickle of worried confusion sprouted from my neck to my head. Whatever was on top of the shack swaying was no longer there. I turn back to Stanley.\n\n\"There was something on top of the shack, like, three minutes ago. Whatever it was, it's not there now.\"\n\nStanley gets up and walks beside me. \"On top of the shack, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"How big?\"\n\n\"Uh-\" I take my hands and try my best to convey the size of what i saw sitting on top of the shack. \"I guess about two feet tall... maybe a foot wide?\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" he turns and walks back over to his chair.\n\n\"What?\" I ask.\n\n\"Could have been a raccoon. Either way, no point in trying to chase it down now. Maybe the cameras will pick something up if it's still in the area.\"\n\n\"That's it? We're not going to go over and look around?\"\n\n\"If you want to chase it away, sure be my guest. Look, I've been doing this for a while. Whatever it was, it's still in the area. We're fine. If you're scared you can go in the tent.\"\n\n\"I'm not scared of a raccoon,\" I mutter. I lie back down on the grass and take out my phone. I plug my earphones in and turn on some music.\n\nI'd apparently fallen asleep, because the next conscious thought I had was that the absence of music in my headphones meant that it had gone through the entire playlist. When I take my earbuds out of my ears I can hear Stanley snoring in the chair. I army roll over next to him and sit up to look at the monitor in front of him. The night vision cameras displayed nothing of interest occuring. Hopefully when we ran the footage back we would be able to see something, anything of note that happened while we were sleeping. Although, camera six being out was probably something that I should mention.\n\nI punch Stanley in the shoulder and he wakes up instantly.\n\n\"camera six is off,\" I say. Camera six was one of the cameras we'd set up down the river, pointing North, in hopes to catch wildlife approaching from the bottom of the hill.\n\nStanley stretches and stands up. \"Alright. Watch the cameras.\"\n\n\"Like you were?\"\n\n\"Ehehahah,\" He lets out a dry sarcastic laugh. He tosses me a walkie talkie. \"Tell me when it comes back on. I'll be right back.\"  He makes his way out to the tree line and disappears from sight. After a few seconds of uncomfortable silence I raise the walkie-talkie to my face.  \"Yo,\" I say.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Just making sure they work.\"\n\n\"You think I'd just forget to put batteries in the walkie talkies?\"\n\n\"You forgot the beers... so.\"\n\n\"Touché, touché.\"\n\nThere's another long silence. I begin to look at my surroundings again. Every tree seemed like prime real estate for a woodland axe murderer to be hiding behind. Feeling extremely exposed, I reorient the chair so that the back is resting against the tree. I peer into the darkness of the treeline over to the right. Clearing my throat I raise the walkie talkie again.\n\n\"So what about the other jobs you had? The good ones?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Oh. Well, I don't know about good. But I remember the time we discovered a new subspecies of elk right before it went extinct.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yup. Emerald Glaze-back Allakaket Cervus was what we called it. Beautiful things. Green tails and shining emerald horns. Thing looked like it was right out of a fantasy painting. You’d be surprised by the things that humans have never encountered before. For a good reason too. By the time we got up there for the study, hunters were carrying the last of them in the back of their trucks.\"\n\n\"That... sucks. Like, a lot.\"\n\n\"Yep. It's amazing the things people do to some of God's beautiful creatures. Sometimes I wonder if an asteroid shouldn't rip through this planet at light speed for some of the things that happen here on a daily basis. Anyway, you getting anything on the monitor?\"\n\nI lean over and take a peek at the monitor. The footage from camera six was still displaying black. The footage for camera four was now also black.\n\n\"No. And camera four is down now too.\"\n\nStanley muttered a curse. \"When I find this raccoon I swear. Alright take one of the cameras from the bag and just replace it.\"\n\n\"Right now?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'll come back for the other one. I'm just going to have to replace this one too.\"\n\n\"Uhh. I think I'll wait for you to get back.\"\n\n\"It's right across the river, you don't have to be scared.\"\n\n\"I'm not s-\" I sigh and grab the camera from the bag. “Fine, I'll get it.” I step out into the clearing toward the river, pause, look left then right, then speed walk to the river. I take my sneakers and socks off, roll up my pants leg as high as I can, and step into the water.\n\nThe stream wasn't deep. Just about knee height. Still being out in the open, in the dark, and the sound of the running water made me feel like something could be right behind me and I'd never know. With my head on full swivel I make my way across the river to the other side. Walking up from the shore I slow my pace in an attempt to quiet my footsteps as much as possible. A few paces in the shack become visible again. Camera four was set up in a tree about thirty feet beyond the shack over to the right. I walk past the shack to where the camera should have been set up. The camera had fallen from the tree and busted apart. I pick up the camera and turn it over in my hand. The thing looked like it had been stepped on by a Timberland wearing New Yorker.\n\n\"Stan,\" I say into the walkie talkie.\n\n\"Yah?\"\n\n\"The camera fell from the tree. I'm gonna set this one up at the base of it.\"\n\n\"Sounds good.\"\n\nI lean down to pick up the camera, but a mass beside the tree grabs my attention. I whip my flashlight from my back pocket and shine it on the object. Lying beside the tree was a dead racoon.\n\n\"Oh, hey. You were right. It was a coon.\"\n\n\"Come again?\"\n\n\"A raccoon. I found the racoon. It's dead.\"\n\n\"Good. I'm gonna come over and piss on it,\\`\\`said the animal loving biologist.\n\nI take a few steps closer to get a better look. The thing looked like it had been messed up pretty bad. it was slightly mangled and bloody. I look up into the tree above.\n\n\"You think a raccoon would die from falling out of a tree?\"\n\n\"Sure? Just set up the camera and get back here.\"\n\n\"Right.\" I set the flashlight on the ground and get to work setting up the camera. After switching it on I pull the bent transmitting antenna plugin from the broken camera and plug it into the new camera. The small screen indicated that the camera had no connection to the monitor set up across the river. I sigh and fidget with the bent antenna. I unplug it and plug it back in. Still no connection was being established. I groan. \n\n\"Yo Stan, the antenna’s broken and I didnt bring a spare one with me.\"\n\nAn annoyed sigh comes from the walkie talkie.\n\nI raise the walkie talkie again. \"Can you-\"\n\n\"I'll be there in a sec,\" He says, cutting me off.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nI kneel beside the raccoon for a closer look against my better judgment. Shining my light on it once again, I can see that It's got a gash along its back. Like someone took scissors to it horizontally. It was doubtful that a fall would do something like that unless it fell backwards onto a paper shredder that got up and walked off halfway through the process of the raccoon's death.\n\n\"Be there in a sec,\" came Stanley's voice from behind.\n\n\"That was fast,\" I muttered to my dead raccoon friend. I walk over to the camera and pick it up.\n\n\"Be there in a sec,\" Stanley said again.\n\n\"You walking in slow motion? You said that already.\"\n\n\"Be there in a sec.\"\n\n\"Dude...\" I turn to face him, but see no one. I take a step forward.\n\n\"Stan!\" I shout.\n\nThere's silence. I take another step forward, then stop. Atop the shack a figure silently swayed in the dark. I raise my flashlight to it. There's a shiny reflective glint of furry red and blue before the figure ducks behind the shack. It didn't jump off of the six foot tall shack. It ducked behind it. Meaning whatever it was was easily over seven feet tall. My feet stuck to the ground, my hand shakily scanned the outline of the shack with my flashlight. On the ground beside the shack something poked out. I immediately found it with my flashlight. A pair of eyes that poked from behind the shack stared into the light. It was avian. But its head was huge, bigger than any type of avian creature I had ever seen before. The head slowly raised from the ground along the outline of the shack until it was back to the top of the shack peering at me from over it. Two hands held on to the top of the shack from the otherside. Not claws, not wings. *Hands.* Then the thing must have straightened its back because its height grew by another three feet. It let out a low pitched screech.\n\nI don't know when I started to run but I was halfway to the river before my brain had even caught up with what my body was doing. I saw Stanley walking up from the stream. Whatever he shouted as I ran by him couldn't be heard over the otherworldly screech of whatever it was that was behind us in that forest. I ran through the stream, jumped over the chair of the setup, and kept running. I ran until I couldn't run, then I jogged until I couldn't jog. I leapt out into the road and practically collided with the van. I jumped when I heard a noise behind me. A wide eyed Stanley emerged from the treeline and ran over to the other side of the van. He unlocked it  and we jumped in. In a matter of seconds we were backing out away from the forest and driving down the hill to the town below.\n\n\"Did you-\"\n\n\"I saw it,\" He said clearly, as out of breath as I was.\n\nWe drove in silence until we made it back to the Pierrimay lab. Even then we just sat in the parking lot for another ten minutes. It was then that I began to laugh.\n\nStanley looked at me. He didn't say anything but I could tell he thought that I had lost my mind.\n\n\"One of God's beautiful creatures, huh?\" I ask.\n\nHe chuckles. Then he laughs.\n\nThe official report that was gave was a \"Very tall man in a bird costume.\" However, after a long conversation between Stanley and Vincent I was informed that a removal team had been sent out to the forest to deal with whatever the thing was that we saw. I didn't even know that the lab had a \"removal team.\" When I asked what the removal team would do Stanley just shrugged, and I couldn't defeat the notion that I had just seen something that, too, would soon be extinct.\n\nThe next week my pay had nearly doubled. Even through my incentivised silence, I found it hard to keep my mind off of what I had seen. To call the thing a bird would be such an affront to the common dictionary definition of the word. And I knew it wasn't a costume because there aren't any costumes I know of that can blink. If I had to try to even compare it to something familiar I'd say that it looked like a parakeet. That would even explain its ability to mimic Stanley's voice from the radio. But the hands… the human-like hands that held on to the top of the shack.\n\nStill, I mentioned no more of it. Neither did Stanley. No one was ever allowed to go on surveys in groups of less than three after that. Which was a great idea in retrospect. In fact I can say with certainty that the new policy saved us a world of trouble later down the line on some of our later jobs, which I may feel like sharing.",

        "text": " \n\nAnyone knows about the Powerpuff girls show right? It’s about a show where three girls named Blossom who is the leader, Bubbles who is the laughter and Buttercup who is the muscle that fights crime on a day to day basis with Mojo, Princess Morbucks, HIM and well you get the idea. There is The Rowdyruff Boys that fans keep bringing up about with Brick, Boomer and Butch like, why can’t they get along or something like that. Besides they always ship The PPG with RRB and It’s a bit odd. Well there is an episode, or was supposed to be till it was locked away or thrown out. My friend worked there as an intern when he heard about this episode.\n\nIt started as a rumor during his time there when the creator of the show, Craig McCracken, said he was gonna see a new review of the episode he was told about and came out a few minutes later looking like he saw a ghost. When he was questioned about this, he refused to answer and just walked away. Before he did however, he told the people in the room to lock that thing up and never let it see the light of day in a more disappointed tone. I think some people managed to peek at whatever he was watching since the rumors said, ‘I think one of the Rowdyruff boys did something.” or, \"Was it Boomer or Bubbles that did something?”. Of course they were rumors so my friend didn’t mind but he still was curious. Apparently to my friend, he went to a room full of episodes that were scrapped, cut and removed and he managed to find it. He then put up a computer in the room where he downloaded the episode on the computer on a mp4 format and put it in his Media player to put it on my computer and play the contents(This was back in 2004.) And it was just called sadboomer oddly. How he did it with no one watching is beyond me, but what is known is that we are gonna see what the contents of this episode holds. My friend went to my home so we could watch it but most of the video was corrupted. Since I know how to fix a video, I fixed it mostly since there was too much to work on so we had to watch what was on the video.\n\nThe video started out with a normal intro like any other episode except with a few glitches here and there. Then the Title, ”Hurtful words” came on screen but there were no flashes of the Powerpuff girls flying in the screen, it just faded in as the pop music that usually plays in the title cards was replayed with just a slow piano music piece as if we’re gonna see something sad. It continued to fade into the opening credits but the names were absent as if it was unfinished as the last card just had no names at all.\n\nThe Episode starts with the usual, “The city of Townsville!” then cuts to a calm street with people walking and cars driving while the narrator continues, \"Has been pretty calm lately this past week.” It then cuts to different scenes of people doing different activities in the street as the narrator continues saying, \"As citizens like workers, bosses, joggers, shoppers…” It went on until it cut to Boomer just having a drink while walking as the narrator finishes by saying, \"And even villains just taking a stroll in the day!” Boomer then finishes his drink as he just throws it on the street and steals another from a random person as the Narrator then says, ”Well…mostly strolling.”\n\nThe scene just continues as Boomer drinks from someone’s cup that he’d stolen just to at least do something while his brothers are away doing well whatever they are doing. He then bumps into a girl with long hair over her eyes as she falls to her knees as Boomer just keeps walking. “Hey!” The girl said, \"Watch where you’re going!” Boomer looks back at her, mockingly saying, “Oh I’m sorry! I didn’t see you there!” He then casually laughs as he walks over and snatches a snack from her. “Hey, give that back!” The girl then shouted. “Or what? Gonna beat me up?” Boomer says in an amused and mocking tone as she stands up. “No.” She says offscreen as Boomer just looks at her. “Yeah I am sooooo scared by a stupid gi-” Boomer suddenly paused and jumped a bit at something offscreen. It then cuts the girl’s face. Her hair no longer covers her face as her eyes are shown. Her eyes were oddly bloodshot as we looked at the screen more. She looked at Boomer with mild anger in her eyes as she just said, \"But I should be mindful of what I’m doing if I were you.” Boomer then awkwardly looks around as if she was talking to someone else and then looks back to the girl just gone as if she was never there. Boomer starred as the spot for a while with a weirded out expression. \"Freak” he said as he rolled his eyes in annoyance as he walked off with a stolen snack and a stolen drink. Me and my friend both look at each other with confusion both asking ourselves, “What was that about?”\n\nThe scene continues as Boomer walks for a bit until he spots Brick and Butch fighting The PowerPuff Girls. He then literally throws the drink and snack aside as he flies to fight the girls as he says, \"Finally! About time!” since he was waiting for something to happen. He then meets them as they ask him where he was. He then says that he was just taking a stroll as they looked at him with disgust. They then yelled at him for not being there with them when the Powerpuff Girls were fighting them for about an hour and Boomer did not know this. Boomer then said he’ll make it up as he charges head first and hits the leader several times before getting pummeled by them as there was a montage of him getting beaten up till he fell in an alleyway with a bruised face with a black eye and had messy hair. He tried to apologize but was cut off with Brick yelling at him of how he’s an idiot for not only leaving them alone with the girls and getting beaten by the girls. Brick then starts to verbally insult him so much that he starts tearing up as Brick smacks him in the head as Butch just laughs at Boomer’s misfortune. We were shocked while watching Boomer just getting abused like this, especially by his brothers. Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles fly in frame and question what in the world are they doing to Boomer. Both have an argument about why you shouldn't hurt your brother before they begin to fight again. Bubbles did try to ask whether he was ok or not before she was pulled into the fight. Boomer then looked at the sky with the fight taking place before flying offscreen. It then cut to Boomer’s expression and he looked like he was about to cry as he just walks off somewhere.\n\nWe then see the fight still going on and both teams are getting tired. Both stopped as Bubbles pointed out the Boomer isn’t with them or at all since they fought for 2 hours. apparently Bubbles has been try to get their attention but no one listened till now. The Girls are a bit worried while the Boys were not concerned. Both have an argument again till finally Bubbles suggested we should find him since they didn’t see him after what happened in the alleyway. Both agree pretty much but Brick is still less concerned about but still agrees to. Both then try to come up with a plan of how to find him quickly.\n\nThe scene then fades to Boomer walking alone on a street with a gloomy expression while sad music plays in the background. A small montage plays with Boomer going to a candy shop, basically eating loads of sugar, punches a hole through a vending machine to get some drinks, then lays down in an alleyway as it cuts to black. My friend then asks, “Is this what Craig saw?” To be honest, this is what he probably saw. The scene then cuts to night where the girls are in their room, wondering where Boomer would be. Bubbles and Buttercup are concerned about Boomer while Blossom is a bit worried about it but is sure that Boomer might be found by the police.\n\nThis conversation goes on for a minute or two till it cuts back to Boomer walking in the street looking depressed, messy and…drunk? It turns out that the drinks Boomer stole from a vending machine earlier was actually beer cans since he is stumbling and is slurring with his words a bit as he rants on about how he was bullied by his brothers everyday no matter what he did. Plus he ate a lot of sugar he was also jittery but more mad then happy as you see in cartoons where a character eats sugar (Mac from Foster's home for imaginary friends for example.). As he ranted on of what he might do to his brothers when he gets the chance, the Narrator suddenly responds saying, “Boomer I think you might need to think about this and-” he was then cut off with Boomer telling him to shut up as he stares at the screen as we just realized that the Narrator was listening this whole time. He continued to rant until the screen glitched for a few seconds and came back to Boomer just staring at the screen. We were both caught off guard because of how fast it happened. The first thing we noticed was his eyes. His eyes were replaced with what looked like photos eye's placed on his eyes which were just black.\n\nNote that this creeped the hell out of me and my friend when we first saw this. It was like this for what seemed like a few minutes, just nothing but staring, no music, no sound, just silence. It glitches again and comes back to the scene of where it was before. Boomer stops ranting and looks down with tears in his eyes. We get to see flashbacks of previous episodes with the Rowdyruff boys having fun wrecking stuff and hanging out like brothers. The flashbacks suddenly end as Boomer just looks up and says, \"Where did it all go wrong?\" and then after a while, he realized that his life was nothing more than just a \"Punching bag\" for everyone. As he made that realization, a smirk appears on his face and starts to laugh, and laugh and laugh uncontrollably. The scene suddenly cuts to black for a few seconds before cutting back to the Powerpuff girl’s house at night. We get to see Boomer almost tripping on his way to a door to the lab since he drank beer and ate candy which I don't think doesn't blend well and he also was kind of giggling a bit when he entered. When he gets there and places his hand on the knob, he then looks back still looking quite tipsy. The scene shifts in the dark living room where we could’ve sworn we saw a figure around the corner and faded away leaving Boomer worried. Boomer opens the door and walks down the stairs still tipsy with the beer he stole earlier. He looks around for a bit till something appears on the screen for a split second so we pause it and rewind back to what it was. It was a message saying, “What are you doing here?” We looked at each other confused over what it meant. We resumed to Boomer still looking around until another message popped up, this time it stayed on the screen longer for us to read. It said, “You know you shouldn't be here.” We were really creeped out at this point but I thought it had something to do with Boomer being in the lab without permission or something like that but who is saying this to them?\n\nThe scene continues as Boomer walks up to the screen as we begin to see his eye turn to Bloodshot as he moves closer to the screen. He then looked up as the scene cuts to a shelf with Boomer looking up. As he reached to grab it, a sound can be heard as Boomer suddenly stops and turned to see what made the noise. We both got to see something around the corner but it was so dark in this scene so we couldn’t tell. Boomer continues to stare at the figure for a while before asking, \"H-hello? Who's there?” We cut back to the figure up close but it was still too dark. Suddenly another figure popped into frame emitting a high pitched screech making us both jump as Boomer was scared out of his skin, put his back on the shelf. There were loads of figures, all of which were so terribly drawn and deformed we couldn’t even make out what they was supposed to look like, Although it did look like some of them were the girls and Boomer's brothers. Several messages appeared on screen and all of them said terrible things as the whispers grew louder and Boomer covered his hands on his face while crying, clearly terrified. The figures and whispers then slowly fade away leaving an empty room with Boomer shaking of what he just saw. Boomer then looks up again as the scene cuts to a object he was reaching for which has a big red X on it as the scene gets covered in static.\n\nThe scene then cuts to Boomer walking in the opposite direction in the streets as he carries the flask from the previous scene with him. He also has a smirk on his face, but it looked forced, not to mention his eyes were slightly bloodshot since he was crying from the last scene. As he walked, the whispers from before appeared again and the figures appeared behind objects. It became clear to me that it looked like Boomer was being tormented by hallucinations from what happened and his realization. It was like this until he reached a building as he flew up to the top. There was what sounded like the wind in the background save for the whispers. \n\nAs he reached his smile dropped to a frown and teared up even more. The whispers were deafening in this scene as it continued. And then without warning, he chugged the flask in one motion and threw it down as the whispers went silent completely as he drank it but the wind still played. A few seconds pass and he starts convulsing as dark brown spots appear around him as his skin turns pale. Me and my friend knew instantly what he just drank, he just drank Antidote X. He then falls off the roof from the pain and starts crying loudly. And then a few seconds later, he hits the ground with a sickening splat as the scene suddenly stops and repeats for a while. The wind sounded more distorted as his face faded in the screen, horribly mangled.\n\nAnd then everything suddenly stops. Everything was white except for Boomer’s entire outline was just blue. There was soft orchestra music in the background as he opens his eyes and looks around confused and dazed. He then looks in front of him to a familiar figure. The figure looked like Bunny from the episode Twisted Sister. The Bunny ghost looked at him with some concern and sadness as it asked him if what he did was really worth it. He opened his mouth to answer but stopped, frowned and looked down. The music stopped and the screen cut to black as Boomer said one word, ”No.”\n\nIt was just silent for a while until we started hearing Bubble's voice calling for Boomer with her sisters and his brothers. As the voices drew closer Boomer’s face fades in with blood on his left side of his face. Bubbles then suddenly screams as Boomer’s left face distorts on screen. The screen comes back to a disgusting sight. It was Boomer, or just his mangled corpse laying on the street. The left side of his face is torn, his limbs were broken, just everything about him was broken. I let out a loudest gasp then I ever did in my whole life. My friend was just shocked at the scene.\n\nAfter a while, a figure in the shape of Boomer started to rise above Boomer with those same eyes we saw before Boomer went to the girl’s house. I immediately suspected to be Boomer’s soul that looked over his corpse.\n\nThe screen cuts out to a black screen again but with only the sounds of police sirens. And then a message popped up saying, ”1 day later.” before fading out. We then get to see Mojo and Him in Mojo’s lair just sitting and looking down. Both have a conversation of how they would have known something like this would have. Mojo then asks, \"Were we good creators?” Him tells him yes and they did everything they could.\n\nThe next scene shows what appeared to be a hospital with Bubbles, Buttercup and Butch. Buttercup and Butch were having a fight over who’s fault it is that caused Boomer to die and Bubbles just looked traumatized. The argument lasted for a few minutes till it finally cuts to another scene. Though I did see something around the corner during the argument.\n\nThe last scene shows Brick on the building looking over the city. Blossom soon joins him and asks how he's doing. Brick really regrets what happened because he was angry about fighting the girls that his anger harmed someone, especially someone important. Both share their condolences and have a meaningful conversation as Brick contemplates if he wants to be a good guy maybe.\n\nThe screen then plays the normal ending scene but cuts abruptly afterwards with a black screen. Two distorted Photo realistic eyes appeared in the darkness as a spotlight appeared over it. It’s Boomer’s ghost. He looked at us for a few seconds until it cut to nothing but a message saying, \"Your words have your own consequences.\"\n\nAnd after that, the episode ends. We were both shocked by what we just saw. After watching it, we immediately put it on Facebook so that anyone can figure out what it is. No one really viewed it and the ones who did thought it was a messed up parody of the PPG so we kept it and kind of forgot about it. We didn’t get anything important until years later when Craig messaged me and my friend. He was confused over how we got hold of this episode and was worried about what we saw. We asked him what happened on that day and he explained that he had this idea of that episode and put two new animators to work on it and the result was not what he intended. He immediately fired the new employees and got nightmares for a month because of it. He also urged us not to share this to the internet but we already did that years ago for answers. However, as far as I know, I haven’t seen any mention of that episode on the internet and it should stay that way.\n\nAt least I learned one thing, everyone has a breaking point, some are weak and some will hold but will crack under pressure. It’s also important to be respectful around people you don’t know what they are going through. After all, most people who reached their breaking point break stuff, shout angrily, and just have a breakdown, but some are silent and just go to a place that calms them as they let it out. Unfortunately in this case, this one was abused and wanted to leave this place by committing suicide.\n\nI guess it’s true of what they say. What you say does have consequences so be mindful of what you say because you don’t know what they are going through.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10qbbaz/siri_has_been_speaking_to_me_in_multiple_voices/",
        "text": "When I’m around people, my Siri sounds totally fine and normal, but when I’m in any situation where nobody would be able to overhear it, Siri speaks to me in a deeper, more-tired, robotic voice. She still says what Siri would normally say, I think, but it’s in that weird voice.\n\nI know my phone’s speakers aren’t going out because they play every video and song I put on just fine. It’s only when I’m alone and using Siri. And even then, she doesn’t ALWAYS talk in that weird voice, but it’s often enough to not just be a fluke at this point.\n\nI’d write it off as a software error or something going wrong with my old phone (and I have a phone case, but I HAVE dropped the phone quite a bit), if it weren’t for the fact that since it’s been happening I’ve been hearing more noises in my house, and strange things like lights turning themselves on BY THE SWITCH have been happening.\n\nLike wtf?? I was alone for 5 days recently and this happened in my laundry room, nearest the garage. Not to mention I keep seeing this damned white fabric sheet or something waving at me from just around my bedroom corner, and always out of the corner of my eye.\n\nIt got me thinking maybe I have some intruder living in my house, and they’re waving something to see if I’m paying attention so they can sneak around lmao. But that can’t be it. I walked straight out of my room towards the fabric thing once—straight into an open room with nothing to hide behind and nowhere to go fast enough without making noise—only took me like ~1.5 seconds to get there, and nothing was there.\n\nOne night when I came home, a skittering was coming from somewhere around a stack of boxes. It sounded like it was clicking its feet or tongue or something, but subtle. Kind of quiet. Just enough to make me curious, yet cautious, but not enough to send me jumping or sprinting away. I thought it could be like a big centipede making clacking noises as it crawled, but I don’t think centipedes actually get that big here, and it would have had to at least been rodent-sized the way it sounded like it was brushing against boxes and moving papers.\n\nUnfortunately, fear of the unknown said “get tf out of there” rather than investigate, so I walked backwards from the boxes, opened the door to my house, and closed it, all while making sure nothing skittered in.\n\nOn another night, a persistent humming started up. And look, I can dismiss knocking and clicking as pipes in the walls or the house settling, even when said knocks and clicks get louder and more frequent until they’re right over my bed (like they absolutely did one night), but when it’s a hum?? And not a sustained hum either, but a hum like the beat of a drum. No melody to it, and always coming in the same intervals.\n\nAt first I thought “Huh, maybe one of my pipes is ringing? Or something is beeping?” And I sat up expecting to be able to hear it more clearly, but maybe it was the raffle of my sheets creating some noise pollution or the thump of my quickening heartbeat distracting me, But the noise seemed to get a bit quieter and recede somewhere in the the ceiling beyond my closet (only to of course get louder when I laid back down, and seemingly only subsiding at some unknown interval after I finally fell asleep despite it).\n\nNow, I’m not saying any of this is substantial evidence of the paranormal. I’m not even trying to argue that any of this is beyond the norm or more than just some minor auditory and visual hallucinations on my part, but whether this is a psychological, spooky, and concerning tale about A Reddit user  (me)’s recent and apparent decline in mental stability, or some actual weird spirit, Siri speaking to me in those two different voices is when all of this became more apparent to me.\n\nSo, sorry this hasn’t been a fantastical story, but it’s still strange to me nonetheless, and if anyone has any theories beyond the obvious (potential hallucinations) to share, I’d be down to hear them (or answer more questions if I can), but I also realize there’s probably not a lot to be gleaned from my mediocre recanting of past events, lol.\n\nUhh, also, as a PS: The whole time I’ve been writing this on my phone, the text cursor has periodically been jumping back to a previous paragraph over and over, and it was only on this second-to-last time it did it that I realized it’s been jumping back to the part where I described Siri’s second voice… so that’s pretty weird, lol. Maybe just a coincidence though.\n\nAnyway, that’s all! Thanks for reading. :P I’ll probably post an update if anything weirder happens.",

        "text": "I remember thinking it was all a joke. That my boss was deadpanning, and that everyone was together on it. It was just so surreal, so unbelievable. It was nothing like I’d experienced before this. And they told me this, on my second week.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” I told them.\n\n“Most people quit after they hear it.”\n\n“And you thought I wouldn’t because I’ve spent a week here?\"\n\n“911 operators are necessary. Without us, things get boggled down, calls don’t get heard, or the proper treatment they deserve.\"\n\n“This isn’t right.”\n\n“I’m willing to live with it,” he said to me. “Are you?”\n\nThat was the question. Was I going to keep working here. A huge increase in risk, without an equal increase in pay. Hell not even that. I wasn’t getting any increase in pay whatsoever. But, you know, I couldn’t help but feel curious about it.\n\nHe handed me a book. The cover was black, and it was about an inch thick. It didn’t have a title. I guessed this wasn’t for marketing, or for casual reading. Upon flipping to the first page, I was immediately given an example of a monster calling, and afterwards I was tied to it.\n\nI got the whole week for myself, just to read and learn from that book. My own little type of necronomicon, or I wager, operaticon. I couldn’t believe most of the stories on there. I kept repeating to myself, *this just can’t be true.*\n\nOh, how sweet summer child.\n\nThe first thing I learnt was that you should never, under any circumstances give them your real name. Fake names were a coin toss as far as I could tell, because, they were really nicknames. And what was a name if not the original nickname.\n\nThe way to circumvent this was simply to give someone else name. I gave Petra, my coworkers name, and she gave mine, Marie. You’d think that would be stupid. At the end of the day the creature still has our names, but it’s not the name that’s important. It’s the *giving* of the name. It’s like consenting to something.\n\nSome of the monsters were really insistent on getting my name. That’s how you knew something was up. If they keep asking for your name, even after you’ve given them someone else's name. They got clever in how they did it.\n\nHere’s an example.\n\nDate: 08/21/2022\n\nTime: 22:13\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?”\n\n“Might I ask who I’m speaking to?”\n\n“Yes, this is Petra. How might I help you?”\n\n“Arghh, wait I didn’t hear you, could you repeat that?”\n\n“My name is Petra, sir.”\n\n“Arghh, is it alright if I call you Alexandra.”\n\n“No my name is Petra. Please refer to me by it.”\n\n“You’re a filthy little liar Marie. I’ll find yo-”\n\n*Call ended.*\n\nI remember my complexion turning pale white, and my hands shaking as I put down the floor. I decided that I needed a quick break, and stood up from my chair and moved towards the resting room.\n\nPetra stood there, and when she saw my expression, I think she realized what had happened. She hugged me, and I almost broke into sob. In these moments, I’d been advised to think about the reason I’m here, about the times I’ve helped people.\n\n“What happened?” She asked.\n\n“Somebody called asking for my name. I didn’t give them it, and then they somehow knew my name and spat at me.”\n\n“Was their voice dark? And rough?”'\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Did they try to call you Alexandra perchance?”\n\n“Yeah, do you know him?”\n\n“That freaks been calling for years now. It was good that you didn’t let him call you Alexandra, that would be the same as giving him a nickname.”\n\n“That’s what I figured.”\n\n“He’s one of the milder ones. I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but one time he called a recruit. They came to me later, and told me that they’d given their names, before the call had ended. They didn’t show up the next day.”\n\nSometimes people from another universe would somehow call in. I didn’t know how it worked, but they’d be crying over some sort of disaster, desperately pleading for help. But when help arrived, they’d see nothing off there.\n\nI reckoned it had something to do with multiple phones calling at the same time, maybe the same number, at the same spot. The different types of disasters that had struck humans that sounded just like me was absolutely terrifying. A plague spreading, a meteorite, a tsunami, a storm, something esle deciding it no longer wanted to sit still that type of thing.\n\nBut sometimes the threat’s didn’t come from the phone. They were in the office with the rest of us. I remember one day going to work, and finding an exact replica of myself sitting on the chair, taking calls, smiling, helping.\n\nI tapped her on the shoulder, and when she saw me, she calmly stod up, and walked away. As if nothing had happened. When I asked my co-workers about it, they seemed fairly calm about the whole thing.\n\n“Couldn’t tell you two apart.”\n\nThere’ll be the warning calls. When those come we’re instructed to forward it to some sort of organization. It was usually cults I’d never heard of, warning me of a mistake they’d made when they summoned one of their own. Here’s an example of the more freaky ones.\n\nDate: 02/26/2020\n\nTime: 20:43\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?”\n\n“Disaster,” the voice on the other side spat. “Little girl. The world as we know it will be destroyed. The whole world as we know it will disappear entirely. They have been released. Unchained. Free. Angry. Furious.”\n\n“Sir, could you be more clear.”\n\n“Clarity is a sin, not a virtue. Listen little girl. Don’t ever, acknowledge them. Don’t say their names. Hell, the only way you stay safe is by ignoring them. Do you understand?”\n\n“Sir, could you describe them a little bit more.”\n\n“That I can not do.”\n\n“Are they around you?”\n\n“...”\n\n“If they’re around you, tell me you couldn’t hear I just said.”\n\n“I didn’t catch that.”\n\n“How many?”\n\n“One hundred:”\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“Far beneath Washington:”\n\n“Verywell sir, I will be connecting you to those proficient in dealing with these matters. Please hang on.”\n\nI didn’t hear much about this afterwards. There didn’t seem to be any consequences of it. Until, a picture of a large, gray, statue looking creature, being shot down, was posted online. I had a terrible feeling then.\n\nYou’ll get the normal horrors, the expected ones. A girl calling after failing to wake her dead mother, or a serial killer wanting to brag. You know the worst part about those? I just couldn’t care anymore.\n\nI felt like I’d been on a vile gore sight, and then, I saw a common wound. It just didn’t elicit any emotions within me. It felt childish almost. It shouldn’t, but it did. I worried during those moments. I felt there was something seriously wrong with my head. I couldn’t help but think that wasn’t just a feeling.\n\nSometimes I wasn’t allowed to hang up. Sometimes hanging up meant pissing the other end off, and with some creatures that was the last thing you wanted to. They’d sit there and describe their horrific act in detail, as if they had all the time in the world, and I was forced to sit there and listen. Nothing else I could do. Absolutely nothing.\n\nIf they told you to keep listening, or to turn the call off, you had no choice in the matter. Hell, sometimes they could sense if you weren’t paying full attention, and they’d stop and ask you about it. *Marie, are you paying attention?*\n\nOne time, I’d heard one of my co-workers throw the phone against a wall. Their face was red, and they looked seconds away from shrieking. Even when we tried to talk to them about it, they wouldn’t budge.\n\nThe next day they called me, panicking. I could hear some sort of shrieking noise from the background. The call ended abruptly. I never heard from them again.\n\nThat was the thing that scared me the most. It was something entirely different to have somebody you cared for disappear. It was just as real as the death’s you heard about, logically, but psychologically, it wasn’t a number or a name disappearing. It was a person, their identity and personality perishing alongside.And my brain understood that. Not just in an intellectual way.So yeah, I never hanged up first, except for one time, one time I was supposed to hang up. It was if the caller on the other side said goodbye. A simple word, but one that had to be respected. As you could assume, there was consequences to not following that rule. They found you disrespectful.\n\nThe ones that told you when to hangup always spoke slowly. That was the way you’d identify them. I don’t know what the hell they were. Probably some sort of sick monster. No. Certainly some sort of sick monster, but one that really valued their goodbyes.\n\nCompared to the other ones, they’re not all that bad. They really just call in to speak about their day, and how it’s gone. It’s a regular conversation. Nothing odd about it. Forward and back, forward, and back, until the goodbye.\n\nAnd that’s the end. Always. Not ending the call at goodbye’s like not turning the car when there’s a cliff ahead. Certain peril. No question about it. It was a really stupid way to go about things, and I really disliked it. It’s tricky. It really is. But that’s the way things went here.\n\nOne time I didn’t follow that call. After I shut off the call. Something strange happened. My screen turned black for a mere second. It just shut off, and then I was back on the call with the same person as before, although the calm tone was entirely gone. By the time I’d realized what my mistake was, I couldn’t do anything about it. Damn it.The exhaustion that had made me commit the mistake, decided to not stick around, dissapearing the second I realized what was happening. The slick bastard. My heart hammered, and my voice shook. It was the first time I’d broken the rules, and I really hoped that it wouldn’t go down badly.\n\nThey spoke with anger. “So you think we’re worthless?”“No, please, it was a mistake.”\n\n“Bullshit! You think we’re worthless, not worth your time, huh? I’ll show you what happens when you disrespect me in such a way.”\n\nAnd then the call ended, leaving me pondering what the hell it was they would do me. Was it going to be murder, and if so how? Would they decapitate my head, or stab me and let me slowly bleed to death, or would they poision me and turn my body blue, or would they tie weights to my ankles and toss me into the ocean for the sharks to eat.\n\nMaybe it would be worse. Maybe they’d abduct me, and torture me for hours on end. I’d heard calls of torture victims. Their voice had a certain quality to it. It sounded entirely broken. There was no confdicen or spirit in there any longer.\n\nI had no doubts that would happen to me. People had a wrong conception that they’d be able to survive torture. No. Not a chance. I couldn’t pinch my arm for more than ten seconds without wanting to scream out in pain. What if that happened for hours on end, day after day. I’d lose it. Something inside of my brain would snap. I’d stop functioning. My eyes would lose their glint, and drool would slowly escape my lips without my having any clue about it.\n\nThat’s the type of person I could become, and that prospect terrified me like nothing else. Just the mere thought of it happening was enough to dose me full of anxiety and stress, and I didn’t want to deal with that like whatsoever.\n\nI needed to make things right before they did. How though. I tried calling the number back but of course I got no response. Fortunatley, we had a type of emergancy tool we could use to locate the phone’s location. It used GPS, although I’m not going to act like I understood it at all. Although I’ll say right now, that I had never been more thankful for the feature.\n\nThe call was coming from town. From an abandoned building, and I knew that I had to head there, or that something infinitly terrible would happen to me.\n\nIt was a strange thing to fight against my own body in this manner. The parts of me unable to understand reason though this was terrible idea. Heading straight into the forest, was absolutely terrible. And also terrifying.\n\nMy feet were heavy, and refused to lift from their spot. I had to strain with each single step towards the spot  My body shivered and shook. My heart deafened me. It was one thing to fall to death, it was another thing entirely to walk to it.Eventually I reached the abandoned house, and I stood right outside of the door as the rain pe\n\nIt rained outside. That was something I realized as I stood in front of the door to the abandoned house. I hadn’t even noticed that until I reached the door. It was like somebody was playing a game with me. I didn’t like it one bit. Not right now. Not when the truth could be falsehood, and falsehood, could be the truth.\n\nThat’s the thing with creature’s like this. You never know exactly what to expect. It could be the best thing ever. That was probably how the monsters experienced it. Just free food. Free undefensible food. For what the hell were you supposed to do when faced with the unknown, and ununderstandable. I sure as hell didn’t know. Pray for the best maybe?\n\nMaybe that’s why gods were such a wide spread phenomenon. Humans needed something, someway of combatting these creatures. And they found an answer that could work everytime. A promise that everything would turn out well. Not given to you by another human. That would be worthless. No. It was given by the big guy upstairs.\n\nI knocked on the door, but I got no answer, but footsteps came from deeper within the house. I knew for a fact that there was something there. I cringed, and my body took three steps backwards without me knowing about it. It just never came into my awareness.\n\nI knocked again, careful not to break the door. If hanging up on this creature was enough to get me killed. Then I wouldn’t want to imagine what breaking its door would do. Whatever chance of forgiveness I had would dissapear.\n\nWood creaked, and I prepared myself. Something was approaching the door. I put on a smile. I didn’t think it would convince them, but at least it would partially hide the absolute horror covering my face.\n\nThe door opened. Dread. Horror. Terror. A fake smile. Shock?\n\nThere was a human standing there. Her face dripped of blood, and her hair was lose. I don’t think there was more than ten hair strands. It looked to be in terrible condition. I thought my smile was terrible, but hers was even worse. She looked scared. More scared than I’d ever been in my life.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to do.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“What?” she spat.\n\n“I’m the 911 operator somebody in this house called.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“I’ve come to apologize for my rude behaviour.”\n\n“Hmm. I will speak to it for you.”\n\nMy head jerked right when I heard the shutters on the window to my right rustle. *Had it been watching me?* My body unwillingly shook with disgust. The girl saw my response and frowned. *Fuck fuck fuck.*\n\nShe was about to shut the door when I gripped it, and held it open. I couldn’t let things end like this. It wasn’t hard to open it up, matter of fact, she was remarkably weak. When I looked at her arm, I noticed only bones.\n\n“You don’t deserve this,” I whispered with a shaky voice. *Let’s hope its hearing isn’t great.*\n\nShe didn’t say anything. *Damn, why aren’t you saying anyhting? What are you thinking?*\n\nI kept talking. “You know that thing’s a monster. I can get you out of here.”\n\n“Really?” she whispered back, her eyes turning glossy.\n\n“Yes,” I said, happy that I’d gotten though.\n\n“Alright, wait here, I’ll go and talk with it.”\n\nThe door closed, and i heard her walking away and to the room to the right. They spoke in whispers. Her tone was entirely different from the way she’d spoken with me. Instead of spitting, or cursing, she was calm and pleasant, as if she was talking to a temperamental hchild.\n\nShe walked back to the door and opened it. “It wants to see you.”\n\nI swallowed dry saliva and stepped inside. She clutched my arm and pulled me close. \n\n“Don’t break eye contact.”\n\nThe creature wasn’t what I’d expected. It certainly wasn’t threatening. It was barely half a meter tall, had one eye, was bald, and walked quickly on two legs. It looked at me with an eye of scrutiny.\n\nI didn’t know if I should laugh or jerk back in disgust. Was *this* the thing I was so terrified about?\n\n“Chloe,” It said, “go make us tea.”\n\n“Verywell Master.”\n\nWhen she had left, he came closer to me. I made sure to keep eye contact, and no matter how much I wanted to scoot away from the filthy little rat, I stayed still. I didn’t want to piss it off just in case.\n\n“You know I heard you,” it said. “You called me a monster.”\n\n“No you mus-”His hands were on my neck, clenching. I couldn’t breathe. There was a lot a force in his wrists, much more than I had assumed. I hadn’t seen him move. Not a blur. Not out of him being too fast. No.\n\nOur positions were different. He wasn’t standing in front of me. He was standing on the couch beside me, and his hand extended to my neck clenching. It had all been instantaenous, like all the moments inbetween had been removed.\n\n“But,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I trusted her? I gave her a home. I fed her, and she stabbed me in the back?”\n\n*Fed her?*\n\nI couldn’t. At that moment by fear semeed to shift somehow. Instead of running away I wanted to fight somehow. Through a strained voice, I gave him a piece of my mind.\n\n“Feed? Really. Are you fucking joking me? She looks fucking starved.”\n\n“My woman can’t weigh more than me!”\n\n“You’re fucking disgusting!”\n\n“I understand for you humans this doesn’t make much sense, but understand something about me. I’m not a human, this is how we operate. Get that through your head.”\n\n“Fuck you.” His clench tightened. I tried to suck air, but nothing came out. My face began turning white.\n\n“But it was my wife’s fault for letting you in. She will be punished for her acts, and yours.”“F-fuck you.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean you get to walk away free. What should I do to you little bird?”\n\n“F-f--f-”\n\n“I know. You’re complaining about her not eating enough. We can fix that. Chloe, come here.”\n\nBetween sobs she answered. She must have heard the entire exhchange. “Yes Master.”\n\n“Eat her hand.” That was the last thing I remembered. It wasn’t that I passed out. No. That wretched creature must have removed my memories, but when I regained it. I saw a stump where my left hand was supposed to be.\n\nImages of her mouth closing in around my hand floated in and out like hallucinations. In those momentary dreams, I was frozen solid, having to watch the scene go down. I felt the dampness of her mouth. The saliva tickling my skin. The snapping of my bones.\n\nI threw up whatever food I had in my gut. I reckoned she did the same.\n\nI made sure not to hang up on any number after that. I also got into the habit of sending teams to those monsters occasionally. The type of teams specialized in hunting those disgusting things.\n\nI wasn’t supposed to do that. Those teams were there primarily for disaster preventation. The government thought that as long as these monster’s aren’t actively hurting other people, it’s fine, and we should let them live.\n\nNot a chance. Not even one. I stopped caring about lying, and I just tried to get as many of them killed as possible. I couldn’t do it too much, or I’d be fired. I’d do it enough to get to the edge of being fired, before I stopped, and let their anger for me reset.\n\nThere wasn’t many willing to do my job, so I that was probably why I still had it. There was a perk to being neccessary and not easily replacable, and that was that I had way less shits to care about. I could keep going until I became more of a harm than a threat.\n\nIt reminded me of another time. Sometimes when people call in, the terrible act hasn’t happened yet, just the start. The preset. What happens before, and as they describe their situation. I realize more and more what’s going on.\n\nThere’s usually nothing to be done. Death was usually the best thing waiting for them. Nowadays, I just try to lead them to a moment of calm, before their life ends. Let them enjoy the little time.\n\nIn the past, I was naive. I thought I could save these people if I gave them instructions. Failure after failure segmeneted in my mind that it wasn’t possible. That some disasters were to be accepted, not avoided.\n\nIt was hard. Especailly when there was children involved. To hear three, two, four children crying and begging for help. It just sucked something out of you. I couldn’t. I’d cry and shut off the phone. I just couldn’t. Not then, but now, I try to calm them.\n\nI lie to them. I know it’s not right. I should probably just be straight forward with them. But I can’t. Honestly, I find it a lot better to tell them a sweet lie, than to say, *you’re about to be murdered, eaten, abducted, tortured, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do. I’m going to hang up now so that I can actually help people.*\n\nYeah. That would be worse than a lie. Nothing could convince me otherwise. I think when it dawned on me how useless my advice really was, was when a person called me about cult activity. This time it wasn’t a cult that had messed up, it was a soon-to-be victim of a cult calling in and begging for help.\n\nBelieve it or not, we’re contractually obligiated to ignore those calls.  But that’s more legal shit. It just makes it impossible for the state to use the information gained from those calls to sue the cult. Nobody here actually followed that rule. Fuck those freaks.\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergancy?”\n\n“There’s faces in the windows.”\n\n“I’m sorry sir?” I said, and put him on loud-speaker. It was early in the morning, and there wasn’t many calls coming in. I didn’t put him on speaker to entetrain the rest of the speakers. I put him on speaker becasue I knew this wasn’t going to be an average call, and everybody’s experience and expertise would be needed. \n\n“Please say that again.”\n\n“White faces. I think they're masks. Pushed against the window. Black eyes. I can’t see the rest of their body.”\n\nMy coworker, Tom, pushed the mute button as he said, “This seems like the Black Moon cult. These fuckers are vicious. We could send the cops there, but they’ll probably be done by the time the cops arrive.”\n\nHe removed his finger from the mute button. “Alright sir, could you tell me your adress.”\n\n“\\[Redacted\\]”\n\n“Alright, cops are on their way. Alright, are you alone at home.”\n\n“No. My wife is here, and my three children. Two boys, and one baby girl. They’re currently shelted into the upstairs room.”\n\nPetra pressed the mute button. “Wait, isn’t that the cult that watches people get slaughtered.\n\n“Yup,” Tom said. “They’ve planted people all over the house.\"\n\nSnatching his hand, I pulled it away from the button. “Grab a weapon.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I said grab a weapon. A gun preferably. Not a knife, absolutely not a knife. Something long and blunt. A frying pan.”\n\n“We’ve got a frying pan,” he said, as I heard him rush over to the kitchen and grab it. “Why do I need it?”\n\n“Go to your family now!”\n\n3 kids, one mother, was a goddamn wet dream for these sick bastards. They were easy prey up there. One of the cult members would crawl out of the corner they hid in, approach the family, and slash into them, causing all havoc. He needed to make it there in time.\n\nThe upside to blunt weapons was that they could knock people out. After they were knocked out, they had no defense. Somebody with no defense could easily be taken care off. It was way better than a knife. Sure you’d kill the other person, but not quickly enough for them to not seriously hurt you back, even kill you.\n\nI heard him rushing up the stairs, and jerking a door open.  He breathed heavily. “Oh thank god.”\n\n“Are they safe?”\n\n“They’re safe.”\n\n“Great. Lock the door.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Just do it.”\n\nHe slammed the door shut, and I heard the lock snap into place. There was crying in the background. I’d take a guess it was the baby crying. Poor thing. I really hoped that things would turn out well.\n\n“Alright,” I said. “What I’m about to say will freak you out.”\n\n“?”\n\n“One of them is in the room already.”\n\n“What!” He said. I could imagine his head jerking around, as he tried to figure out what happened. But, then another noise took his attention. They broke the door of their house open, and I could hear multiple men rushing in. His breath quickened.\n\n“Search the room carefully. Check under the bed, check the ceiling, the wardrobe, everywhere. Remember. Cops are on their way. Just survive long enough.”\n\n“Fuck fuck fuck,” he said, his voice getting further away from the phone, occasionally. HE was really searching the house.\n\n“I need you to calm down.” Christ. The words sounded ridiculous even as I said them, but it was true. He needed to calm down. It was necessary. Panic wouldn’t do him any good, except for strengthening his muscles for a strike.“I am fucking calm!” He spat. I could hear him stomping around the room. Suddenly, his wife shrieked. I knew something terrible had happened. “You fucking bastard.”\n\nThe sound of metal smashing bone was a satisfying one on movie. In real life it was a gnarly, disgusting sound, that made you cringe with disgust, and jerk away from the sound as much as possible. There would be one thunk, and then another, as the head smashed against the floor.\n\n“You fucking bastard,” the man spat. The frying pan banged into flesh again, and again, and again.\n\nThe door to their bedroom began shaking. I could hear the people on the other side desperately tying to get through.”\n\nTom pressed the mute button. “I reckon we should end the call here.”\n\n“We can’t just abandon him!”\n\n“He’s already dead. The last thing we want is to catch the attention of those sick fucks.”\n\n“FUCK THEM,” I stood up screaming. “This isn’t right.”“It’s never been. Welcome to the world sunshine. Now hang up.”\n\n“No.” \n\nPetra joined the conversation. “Hey. I think he’s got a point. There’s no saving them at this point.”\n\n“We can try. How far away are the police?”\n\n“Ten minutes.”\n\n“We can work with that,” I said and unmuted. “Tom you there? Tom, hello?”I hadn’t been paying attention the noise. I just heard screaming. Raw, guttural screaming. That couldn’t be good, but who knew who it was screaming. The cultists or Tom. Alright, I knew. I knew.\n\n“Hello,” A deep voice came back. Not Tom. “This is 911 yes?”\n\n“What are you going to say that I broke the rules?”\n\n“That you did, but this was simply excellent. The fury, the passion, the raw emotion this man displayed was simply delicious. We’d like a recording of the call.”\n\n“Fuck no,” I said. “Fuck all of you. You’re not going to get shit.”\n\n“You’re going to regret saying that.” That was the last thing he said before I ended the call. At the moment, rage filled me, and made me not care for his threat. It felt like such a small thing. Entirely meaningless in front of my rage. This piece of shit was going to get it.\n\nI walked around the office fantasizing of all the ways I would get this fuck. I would send every goddamn agency made for this at them, and I’d make sure their entire cult collapsed. Oh, how I’d fucking destroy them.\n\nThen my rage disappeared, and I couldn’t believe what I’d done. I’d rejected the wishes of a cult. A cult so established they were included in the black book. Oh christ. I was dead. They’d play their sick little game on me. Ahh fuck. They’d probably already found where I lived, and went there.\n\n“I can’t go home,” I muttered to myself. Home meant death. Something that was a mere game to those freaks. No. I’d have to stay in the car until this whole thing quieted down, and they relaxed. That was the plan.\n\nThat was what I ended up doing. I sat in my car, with the engine on, stopped at a road. I was in a spot where I could see my surroundings clearly. Nobody would be sneaking up on me, that was for sure.\n\nMy panic wouldn’t let me sleep for the whole night. I sat in the chair, my pupils jerking in all directions, expecting the cultists to pop up at any moment. Despite my brave front earlier, I really didn’t want to die.\n\nI fell asleep at dawn. I must have slept through the entire day of work. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind with the current scenarios. Hell, being hunted by a cult was probably one of the best excuses there was in the business.\n\nBut, I realized, that I hadn’t woken up to the sun. The buzzing of my phone must have done it. I looked and saw that i had a missed call from an unknown call. It had just happened. The phone started ringing again.\n\nAlmost instinctively I picked it up. That’s what being a 911 operator will do. *What’s the nature of your eme…*\n\n“Hey Marie.” It was the same dark voice from before. I shuddered. It just made the thing more real. Before this call I’d believed of a slim possibility of them just letting it go. Nope. Not a chance. That was clearly not happening. They were not going to let me off the hook. “So, you haven’t been coming home have you?”He could hear my loud breaths, but I didn’t want him to. I didn’t want him to know that I was scared at all, or that this was impacting me. But there was no hiding it. I was having a tough time holding a mental break down away. The breathing was a necessary sacrifice.\n\n“You guys are sick,” I spat. “All of you.”\n\n“Marie. At least we’re not camping out in a car.” A thick arm cloaked in black wrapped around my neck and squeezed. I saw one of the cult members sitting in the back. I couldn’t get any breath. I had already had a tough time getting breath but this made it even more difficult.\n\nI saw him in the car front mirror. He wore a white mask, with black holes as eyes, like scream except the eyes didn’t look like fabric. They looked like the void, and I could see them spinning, circulating slightly.\n\nThe hand stopped squeezing as hard, letting me take nervous breaths, but it remained there, around my neck, and there was absolutely nothing I could do. This was it. This was my death. I knew it.\n\n“So Marie,” they said. “We recognize the value of 911 operators and would not like to hurt the community, *if* you give us a recording of the tape.”\n\n“Sure, fucking fine.”\n\n“I knew you’d come along.”\n\nThe cultist must have entered the car when I was sleeping. I wasn’t sure how they got past the locks without me noticing. Probably some fucking witchcraft involved in that. Although, even though he’d almost taken my life, it was comedic seeing him simply open the car door and stepping out.\n\nHe didn’t follow the road back. He didn’t follow it forward. The man marched off into the woods with a confident walk, as if he knew exactly where to go. He really convinced me that he had somewhere to go, but I doubted it. This was the middle of the woods, and there  was no way they had *so much* control.\n\nHanging up the phone, I drove back to my office, got a tape and sent it over to them. It wasn’t something I was proud over. Honestly, in my dreams I stayed resistant and told them to fuck off, but, it was different in real life.\n\nI wanted to live my life. I guessed when my life was being threatened, just a few seconds away from death, clear death, not some sort of sudden heart attack, things became really clear to me. I wanted to live.\n\nSo I gave them the tape. Again, I’m not proud of it. I personally removed it from our data storage so that I’d never have to relive that terrible moment, but they have it, and they probably love it.\n\nQuite frankly, the more I work this job, the more I understand why nobody around me seems to care one bit about anything happening. Day in, and day out, terrible things happening, monsters, cultists, disasters. It’s all terrifying. It all left me feeling wrong.\n\nBut, you know, I’m just a person. At the end of the day I’m doing this job to pay my wage, just as I thought at the start. There’s just extra complications, extra rules, and you know, when you get good at following them, and when you know the book inside out, it adds a lot of flavor to the job.\n\nI say that, but honestly, I would never ever risk my life again in the way I did. I’ve done it too many times. It’s never paid off. I’ve never changed anything. Actually, I’ve made it significantly worse sometimes.\n\nWhat was that phrasing? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Screw the intentions. Emotions know better. The fright, horror, terror, and dread were clearly there for a reason after all. They told me to stay away.\n\nI’d ignored them once, but now, I listen to them. Their on my side and I know that very well. They’re working to keep me safe from all of the shit out there. Maybe I’m a coward, but at least I’m alive, and that’s way better than a dead man. A fool if you ask me.\n\nBut that philosophical nonsense was just nonsense. I’m just a frightened girl. I don’t know what to do, and honestly, that’s pissed me off. But hey, I don’t know what to do.",

        "text": "I remember thinking it was all a joke. That my boss was deadpanning, and that everyone was together on it. It was just so surreal, so unbelievable. It was nothing like I’d experienced before this. And they told me this, on my second week.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” I told them.\n\n“Most people quit after they hear it.”\n\n“And you thought I wouldn’t because I’ve spent a week here?\"\n\n“911 operators are necessary. Without us, things get boggled down, calls don’t get heard, or the proper treatment they deserve.\"\n\n“This isn’t right.”\n\n“I’m willing to live with it,” he said to me. “Are you?”\n\nThat was the question. Was I going to keep working here. A huge increase in risk, without an equal increase in pay. Hell not even that. I wasn’t getting any increase in pay whatsoever. But, you know, I couldn’t help but feel curious about it.\n\nHe handed me a book. The cover was black, and it was about an inch thick. It didn’t have a title. I guessed this wasn’t for marketing, or for casual reading. Upon flipping to the first page, I was immediately given an example of a monster calling, and afterwards I was tied to it.\n\nI got the whole week for myself, just to read and learn from that book. My own little type of necronomicon, or I wager, operaticon. I couldn’t believe most of the stories on there. I kept repeating to myself, *this just can’t be true.*\n\nOh, how sweet summer child.\n\nThe first thing I learnt was that you should never, under any circumstances give them your real name. Fake names were a coin toss as far as I could tell, because, they were really nicknames. And what was a name if not the original nickname.\n\nThe way to circumvent this was simply to give someone else name. I gave Petra, my coworkers name, and she gave mine, Marie. You’d think that would be stupid. At the end of the day the creature still has our names, but it’s not the name that’s important. It’s the *giving* of the name. It’s like consenting to something.\n\nSome of the monsters were really insistent on getting my name. That’s how you knew something was up. If they keep asking for your name, even after you’ve given them someone else's name. They got clever in how they did it.\n\nHere’s an example.\n\nDate: 08/21/2022\n\nTime: 22:13\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?”\n\n“Might I ask who I’m speaking to?”\n\n“Yes, this is Petra. How might I help you?”\n\n“Arghh, wait I didn’t hear you, could you repeat that?”\n\n“My name is Petra, sir.”\n\n“Arghh, is it alright if I call you Alexandra.”\n\n“No my name is Petra. Please refer to me by it.”\n\n“You’re a filthy little liar Marie. I’ll find yo-”\n\n*Call ended.*\n\nI remember my complexion turning pale white, and my hands shaking as I put down the floor. I decided that I needed a quick break, and stood up from my chair and moved towards the resting room.\n\nPetra stood there, and when she saw my expression, I think she realized what had happened. She hugged me, and I almost broke into sob. In these moments, I’d been advised to think about the reason I’m here, about the times I’ve helped people.\n\n“What happened?” She asked.\n\n“Somebody called asking for my name. I didn’t give them it, and then they somehow knew my name and spat at me.”\n\n“Was their voice dark? And rough?”'\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Did they try to call you Alexandra perchance?”\n\n“Yeah, do you know him?”\n\n“That freaks been calling for years now. It was good that you didn’t let him call you Alexandra, that would be the same as giving him a nickname.”\n\n“That’s what I figured.”\n\n“He’s one of the milder ones. I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but one time he called a recruit. They came to me later, and told me that they’d given their names, before the call had ended. They didn’t show up the next day.”\n\nSometimes people from another universe would somehow call in. I didn’t know how it worked, but they’d be crying over some sort of disaster, desperately pleading for help. But when help arrived, they’d see nothing off there.\n\nI reckoned it had something to do with multiple phones calling at the same time, maybe the same number, at the same spot. The different types of disasters that had struck humans that sounded just like me was absolutely terrifying. A plague spreading, a meteorite, a tsunami, a storm, something esle deciding it no longer wanted to sit still that type of thing.\n\nBut sometimes the threat’s didn’t come from the phone. They were in the office with the rest of us. I remember one day going to work, and finding an exact replica of myself sitting on the chair, taking calls, smiling, helping.\n\nI tapped her on the shoulder, and when she saw me, she calmly stod up, and walked away. As if nothing had happened. When I asked my co-workers about it, they seemed fairly calm about the whole thing.\n\n“Couldn’t tell you two apart.”\n\nThere’ll be the warning calls. When those come we’re instructed to forward it to some sort of organization. It was usually cults I’d never heard of, warning me of a mistake they’d made when they summoned one of their own. Here’s an example of the more freaky ones.\n\nDate: 02/26/2020\n\nTime: 20:43\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?”\n\n“Disaster,” the voice on the other side spat. “Little girl. The world as we know it will be destroyed. The whole world as we know it will disappear entirely. They have been released. Unchained. Free. Angry. Furious.”\n\n“Sir, could you be more clear.”\n\n“Clarity is a sin, not a virtue. Listen little girl. Don’t ever, acknowledge them. Don’t say their names. Hell, the only way you stay safe is by ignoring them. Do you understand?”\n\n“Sir, could you describe them a little bit more.”\n\n“That I can not do.”\n\n“Are they around you?”\n\n“...”\n\n“If they’re around you, tell me you couldn’t hear I just said.”\n\n“I didn’t catch that.”\n\n“How many?”\n\n“One hundred:”\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“Far beneath Washington:”\n\n“Verywell sir, I will be connecting you to those proficient in dealing with these matters. Please hang on.”\n\nI didn’t hear much about this afterwards. There didn’t seem to be any consequences of it. Until, a picture of a large, gray, statue looking creature, being shot down, was posted online. I had a terrible feeling then.\n\nYou’ll get the normal horrors, the expected ones. A girl calling after failing to wake her dead mother, or a serial killer wanting to brag. You know the worst part about those? I just couldn’t care anymore.\n\nI felt like I’d been on a vile gore sight, and then, I saw a common wound. It just didn’t elicit any emotions within me. It felt childish almost. It shouldn’t, but it did. I worried during those moments. I felt there was something seriously wrong with my head. I couldn’t help but think that wasn’t just a feeling.\n\nSometimes I wasn’t allowed to hang up. Sometimes hanging up meant pissing the other end off, and with some creatures that was the last thing you wanted to. They’d sit there and describe their horrific act in detail, as if they had all the time in the world, and I was forced to sit there and listen. Nothing else I could do. Absolutely nothing.\n\nIf they told you to keep listening, or to turn the call off, you had no choice in the matter. Hell, sometimes they could sense if you weren’t paying full attention, and they’d stop and ask you about it. *Marie, are you paying attention?*\n\nOne time, I’d heard one of my co-workers throw the phone against a wall. Their face was red, and they looked seconds away from shrieking. Even when we tried to talk to them about it, they wouldn’t budge.\n\nThe next day they called me, panicking. I could hear some sort of shrieking noise from the background. The call ended abruptly. I never heard from them again.\n\nThat was the thing that scared me the most. It was something entirely different to have somebody you cared for disappear. It was just as real as the death’s you heard about, logically, but psychologically, it wasn’t a number or a name disappearing. It was a person, their identity and personality perishing alongside.And my brain understood that. Not just in an intellectual way.So yeah, I never hanged up first, except for one time, one time I was supposed to hang up. It was if the caller on the other side said goodbye. A simple word, but one that had to be respected. As you could assume, there was consequences to not following that rule. They found you disrespectful.\n\nThe ones that told you when to hangup always spoke slowly. That was the way you’d identify them. I don’t know what the hell they were. Probably some sort of sick monster. No. Certainly some sort of sick monster, but one that really valued their goodbyes.\n\nCompared to the other ones, they’re not all that bad. They really just call in to speak about their day, and how it’s gone. It’s a regular conversation. Nothing odd about it. Forward and back, forward, and back, until the goodbye.\n\nAnd that’s the end. Always. Not ending the call at goodbye’s like not turning the car when there’s a cliff ahead. Certain peril. No question about it. It was a really stupid way to go about things, and I really disliked it. It’s tricky. It really is. But that’s the way things went here.\n\nOne time I didn’t follow that call. After I shut off the call. Something strange happened. My screen turned black for a mere second. It just shut off, and then I was back on the call with the same person as before, although the calm tone was entirely gone. By the time I’d realized what my mistake was, I couldn’t do anything about it. Damn it.The exhaustion that had made me commit the mistake, decided to not stick around, dissapearing the second I realized what was happening. The slick bastard. My heart hammered, and my voice shook. It was the first time I’d broken the rules, and I really hoped that it wouldn’t go down badly.\n\nThey spoke with anger. “So you think we’re worthless?”“No, please, it was a mistake.”\n\n“Bullshit! You think we’re worthless, not worth your time, huh? I’ll show you what happens when you disrespect me in such a way.”\n\nAnd then the call ended, leaving me pondering what the hell it was they would do me. Was it going to be murder, and if so how? Would they decapitate my head, or stab me and let me slowly bleed to death, or would they poision me and turn my body blue, or would they tie weights to my ankles and toss me into the ocean for the sharks to eat.\n\nMaybe it would be worse. Maybe they’d abduct me, and torture me for hours on end. I’d heard calls of torture victims. Their voice had a certain quality to it. It sounded entirely broken. There was no confdicen or spirit in there any longer.\n\nI had no doubts that would happen to me. People had a wrong conception that they’d be able to survive torture. No. Not a chance. I couldn’t pinch my arm for more than ten seconds without wanting to scream out in pain. What if that happened for hours on end, day after day. I’d lose it. Something inside of my brain would snap. I’d stop functioning. My eyes would lose their glint, and drool would slowly escape my lips without my having any clue about it.\n\nThat’s the type of person I could become, and that prospect terrified me like nothing else. Just the mere thought of it happening was enough to dose me full of anxiety and stress, and I didn’t want to deal with that like whatsoever.\n\nI needed to make things right before they did. How though. I tried calling the number back but of course I got no response. Fortunatley, we had a type of emergancy tool we could use to locate the phone’s location. It used GPS, although I’m not going to act like I understood it at all. Although I’ll say right now, that I had never been more thankful for the feature.\n\nThe call was coming from town. From an abandoned building, and I knew that I had to head there, or that something infinitly terrible would happen to me.\n\nIt was a strange thing to fight against my own body in this manner. The parts of me unable to understand reason though this was terrible idea. Heading straight into the forest, was absolutely terrible. And also terrifying.\n\nMy feet were heavy, and refused to lift from their spot. I had to strain with each single step towards the spot  My body shivered and shook. My heart deafened me. It was one thing to fall to death, it was another thing entirely to walk to it.Eventually I reached the abandoned house, and I stood right outside of the door as the rain pe\n\nIt rained outside. That was something I realized as I stood in front of the door to the abandoned house. I hadn’t even noticed that until I reached the door. It was like somebody was playing a game with me. I didn’t like it one bit. Not right now. Not when the truth could be falsehood, and falsehood, could be the truth.\n\nThat’s the thing with creature’s like this. You never know exactly what to expect. It could be the best thing ever. That was probably how the monsters experienced it. Just free food. Free undefensible food. For what the hell were you supposed to do when faced with the unknown, and ununderstandable. I sure as hell didn’t know. Pray for the best maybe?\n\nMaybe that’s why gods were such a wide spread phenomenon. Humans needed something, someway of combatting these creatures. And they found an answer that could work everytime. A promise that everything would turn out well. Not given to you by another human. That would be worthless. No. It was given by the big guy upstairs.\n\nI knocked on the door, but I got no answer, but footsteps came from deeper within the house. I knew for a fact that there was something there. I cringed, and my body took three steps backwards without me knowing about it. It just never came into my awareness.\n\nI knocked again, careful not to break the door. If hanging up on this creature was enough to get me killed. Then I wouldn’t want to imagine what breaking its door would do. Whatever chance of forgiveness I had would dissapear.\n\nWood creaked, and I prepared myself. Something was approaching the door. I put on a smile. I didn’t think it would convince them, but at least it would partially hide the absolute horror covering my face.\n\nThe door opened. Dread. Horror. Terror. A fake smile. Shock?\n\nThere was a human standing there. Her face dripped of blood, and her hair was lose. I don’t think there was more than ten hair strands. It looked to be in terrible condition. I thought my smile was terrible, but hers was even worse. She looked scared. More scared than I’d ever been in my life.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to do.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“What?” she spat.\n\n“I’m the 911 operator somebody in this house called.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“I’ve come to apologize for my rude behaviour.”\n\n“Hmm. I will speak to it for you.”\n\nMy head jerked right when I heard the shutters on the window to my right rustle. *Had it been watching me?* My body unwillingly shook with disgust. The girl saw my response and frowned. *Fuck fuck fuck.*\n\nShe was about to shut the door when I gripped it, and held it open. I couldn’t let things end like this. It wasn’t hard to open it up, matter of fact, she was remarkably weak. When I looked at her arm, I noticed only bones.\n\n“You don’t deserve this,” I whispered with a shaky voice. *Let’s hope its hearing isn’t great.*\n\nShe didn’t say anything. *Damn, why aren’t you saying anyhting? What are you thinking?*\n\nI kept talking. “You know that thing’s a monster. I can get you out of here.”\n\n“Really?” she whispered back, her eyes turning glossy.\n\n“Yes,” I said, happy that I’d gotten though.\n\n“Alright, wait here, I’ll go and talk with it.”\n\nThe door closed, and i heard her walking away and to the room to the right. They spoke in whispers. Her tone was entirely different from the way she’d spoken with me. Instead of spitting, or cursing, she was calm and pleasant, as if she was talking to a temperamental hchild.\n\nShe walked back to the door and opened it. “It wants to see you.”\n\nI swallowed dry saliva and stepped inside. She clutched my arm and pulled me close. \n\n“Don’t break eye contact.”\n\nThe creature wasn’t what I’d expected. It certainly wasn’t threatening. It was barely half a meter tall, had one eye, was bald, and walked quickly on two legs. It looked at me with an eye of scrutiny.\n\nI didn’t know if I should laugh or jerk back in disgust. Was *this* the thing I was so terrified about?\n\n“Chloe,” It said, “go make us tea.”\n\n“Verywell Master.”\n\nWhen she had left, he came closer to me. I made sure to keep eye contact, and no matter how much I wanted to scoot away from the filthy little rat, I stayed still. I didn’t want to piss it off just in case.\n\n“You know I heard you,” it said. “You called me a monster.”\n\n“No you mus-”His hands were on my neck, clenching. I couldn’t breathe. There was a lot a force in his wrists, much more than I had assumed. I hadn’t seen him move. Not a blur. Not out of him being too fast. No.\n\nOur positions were different. He wasn’t standing in front of me. He was standing on the couch beside me, and his hand extended to my neck clenching. It had all been instantaenous, like all the moments inbetween had been removed.\n\n“But,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I trusted her? I gave her a home. I fed her, and she stabbed me in the back?”\n\n*Fed her?*\n\nI couldn’t. At that moment by fear semeed to shift somehow. Instead of running away I wanted to fight somehow. Through a strained voice, I gave him a piece of my mind.\n\n“Feed? Really. Are you fucking joking me? She looks fucking starved.”\n\n“My woman can’t weigh more than me!”\n\n“You’re fucking disgusting!”\n\n“I understand for you humans this doesn’t make much sense, but understand something about me. I’m not a human, this is how we operate. Get that through your head.”\n\n“Fuck you.” His clench tightened. I tried to suck air, but nothing came out. My face began turning white.\n\n“But it was my wife’s fault for letting you in. She will be punished for her acts, and yours.”“F-fuck you.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean you get to walk away free. What should I do to you little bird?”\n\n“F-f--f-”\n\n“I know. You’re complaining about her not eating enough. We can fix that. Chloe, come here.”\n\nBetween sobs she answered. She must have heard the entire exhchange. “Yes Master.”\n\n“Eat her hand.” That was the last thing I remembered. It wasn’t that I passed out. No. That wretched creature must have removed my memories, but when I regained it. I saw a stump where my left hand was supposed to be.\n\nImages of her mouth closing in around my hand floated in and out like hallucinations. In those momentary dreams, I was frozen solid, having to watch the scene go down. I felt the dampness of her mouth. The saliva tickling my skin. The snapping of my bones.\n\nI threw up whatever food I had in my gut. I reckoned she did the same.\n\nI made sure not to hang up on any number after that. I also got into the habit of sending teams to those monsters occasionally. The type of teams specialized in hunting those disgusting things.\n\nI wasn’t supposed to do that. Those teams were there primarily for disaster preventation. The government thought that as long as these monster’s aren’t actively hurting other people, it’s fine, and we should let them live.\n\nNot a chance. Not even one. I stopped caring about lying, and I just tried to get as many of them killed as possible. I couldn’t do it too much, or I’d be fired. I’d do it enough to get to the edge of being fired, before I stopped, and let their anger for me reset.\n\nThere wasn’t many willing to do my job, so I that was probably why I still had it. There was a perk to being neccessary and not easily replacable, and that was that I had way less shits to care about. I could keep going until I became more of a harm than a threat.\n\nIt reminded me of another time. Sometimes when people call in, the terrible act hasn’t happened yet, just the start. The preset. What happens before, and as they describe their situation. I realize more and more what’s going on.\n\nThere’s usually nothing to be done. Death was usually the best thing waiting for them. Nowadays, I just try to lead them to a moment of calm, before their life ends. Let them enjoy the little time.\n\nIn the past, I was naive. I thought I could save these people if I gave them instructions. Failure after failure segmeneted in my mind that it wasn’t possible. That some disasters were to be accepted, not avoided.\n\nIt was hard. Especailly when there was children involved. To hear three, two, four children crying and begging for help. It just sucked something out of you. I couldn’t. I’d cry and shut off the phone. I just couldn’t. Not then, but now, I try to calm them.\n\nI lie to them. I know it’s not right. I should probably just be straight forward with them. But I can’t. Honestly, I find it a lot better to tell them a sweet lie, than to say, *you’re about to be murdered, eaten, abducted, tortured, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do. I’m going to hang up now so that I can actually help people.*\n\nYeah. That would be worse than a lie. Nothing could convince me otherwise. I think when it dawned on me how useless my advice really was, was when a person called me about cult activity. This time it wasn’t a cult that had messed up, it was a soon-to-be victim of a cult calling in and begging for help.\n\nBelieve it or not, we’re contractually obligiated to ignore those calls.  But that’s more legal shit. It just makes it impossible for the state to use the information gained from those calls to sue the cult. Nobody here actually followed that rule. Fuck those freaks.\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergancy?”\n\n“There’s faces in the windows.”\n\n“I’m sorry sir?” I said, and put him on loud-speaker. It was early in the morning, and there wasn’t many calls coming in. I didn’t put him on speaker to entetrain the rest of the speakers. I put him on speaker becasue I knew this wasn’t going to be an average call, and everybody’s experience and expertise would be needed. \n\n“Please say that again.”\n\n“White faces. I think they're masks. Pushed against the window. Black eyes. I can’t see the rest of their body.”\n\nMy coworker, Tom, pushed the mute button as he said, “This seems like the Black Moon cult. These fuckers are vicious. We could send the cops there, but they’ll probably be done by the time the cops arrive.”\n\nHe removed his finger from the mute button. “Alright sir, could you tell me your adress.”\n\n“\\[Redacted\\]”\n\n“Alright, cops are on their way. Alright, are you alone at home.”\n\n“No. My wife is here, and my three children. Two boys, and one baby girl. They’re currently shelted into the upstairs room.”\n\nPetra pressed the mute button. “Wait, isn’t that the cult that watches people get slaughtered.\n\n“Yup,” Tom said. “They’ve planted people all over the house.\"\n\nSnatching his hand, I pulled it away from the button. “Grab a weapon.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I said grab a weapon. A gun preferably. Not a knife, absolutely not a knife. Something long and blunt. A frying pan.”\n\n“We’ve got a frying pan,” he said, as I heard him rush over to the kitchen and grab it. “Why do I need it?”\n\n“Go to your family now!”\n\n3 kids, one mother, was a goddamn wet dream for these sick bastards. They were easy prey up there. One of the cult members would crawl out of the corner they hid in, approach the family, and slash into them, causing all havoc. He needed to make it there in time.\n\nThe upside to blunt weapons was that they could knock people out. After they were knocked out, they had no defense. Somebody with no defense could easily be taken care off. It was way better than a knife. Sure you’d kill the other person, but not quickly enough for them to not seriously hurt you back, even kill you.\n\nI heard him rushing up the stairs, and jerking a door open.  He breathed heavily. “Oh thank god.”\n\n“Are they safe?”\n\n“They’re safe.”\n\n“Great. Lock the door.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Just do it.”\n\nHe slammed the door shut, and I heard the lock snap into place. There was crying in the background. I’d take a guess it was the baby crying. Poor thing. I really hoped that things would turn out well.\n\n“Alright,” I said. “What I’m about to say will freak you out.”\n\n“?”\n\n“One of them is in the room already.”\n\n“What!” He said. I could imagine his head jerking around, as he tried to figure out what happened. But, then another noise took his attention. They broke the door of their house open, and I could hear multiple men rushing in. His breath quickened.\n\n“Search the room carefully. Check under the bed, check the ceiling, the wardrobe, everywhere. Remember. Cops are on their way. Just survive long enough.”\n\n“Fuck fuck fuck,” he said, his voice getting further away from the phone, occasionally. HE was really searching the house.\n\n“I need you to calm down.” Christ. The words sounded ridiculous even as I said them, but it was true. He needed to calm down. It was necessary. Panic wouldn’t do him any good, except for strengthening his muscles for a strike.“I am fucking calm!” He spat. I could hear him stomping around the room. Suddenly, his wife shrieked. I knew something terrible had happened. “You fucking bastard.”\n\nThe sound of metal smashing bone was a satisfying one on movie. In real life it was a gnarly, disgusting sound, that made you cringe with disgust, and jerk away from the sound as much as possible. There would be one thunk, and then another, as the head smashed against the floor.\n\n“You fucking bastard,” the man spat. The frying pan banged into flesh again, and again, and again.\n\nThe door to their bedroom began shaking. I could hear the people on the other side desperately tying to get through.”\n\nTom pressed the mute button. “I reckon we should end the call here.”\n\n“We can’t just abandon him!”\n\n“He’s already dead. The last thing we want is to catch the attention of those sick fucks.”\n\n“FUCK THEM,” I stood up screaming. “This isn’t right.”“It’s never been. Welcome to the world sunshine. Now hang up.”\n\n“No.” \n\nPetra joined the conversation. “Hey. I think he’s got a point. There’s no saving them at this point.”\n\n“We can try. How far away are the police?”\n\n“Ten minutes.”\n\n“We can work with that,” I said and unmuted. “Tom you there? Tom, hello?”I hadn’t been paying attention the noise. I just heard screaming. Raw, guttural screaming. That couldn’t be good, but who knew who it was screaming. The cultists or Tom. Alright, I knew. I knew.\n\n“Hello,” A deep voice came back. Not Tom. “This is 911 yes?”\n\n“What are you going to say that I broke the rules?”\n\n“That you did, but this was simply excellent. The fury, the passion, the raw emotion this man displayed was simply delicious. We’d like a recording of the call.”\n\n“Fuck no,” I said. “Fuck all of you. You’re not going to get shit.”\n\n“You’re going to regret saying that.” That was the last thing he said before I ended the call. At the moment, rage filled me, and made me not care for his threat. It felt like such a small thing. Entirely meaningless in front of my rage. This piece of shit was going to get it.\n\nI walked around the office fantasizing of all the ways I would get this fuck. I would send every goddamn agency made for this at them, and I’d make sure their entire cult collapsed. Oh, how I’d fucking destroy them.\n\nThen my rage disappeared, and I couldn’t believe what I’d done. I’d rejected the wishes of a cult. A cult so established they were included in the black book. Oh christ. I was dead. They’d play their sick little game on me. Ahh fuck. They’d probably already found where I lived, and went there.\n\n“I can’t go home,” I muttered to myself. Home meant death. Something that was a mere game to those freaks. No. I’d have to stay in the car until this whole thing quieted down, and they relaxed. That was the plan.\n\nThat was what I ended up doing. I sat in my car, with the engine on, stopped at a road. I was in a spot where I could see my surroundings clearly. Nobody would be sneaking up on me, that was for sure.\n\nMy panic wouldn’t let me sleep for the whole night. I sat in the chair, my pupils jerking in all directions, expecting the cultists to pop up at any moment. Despite my brave front earlier, I really didn’t want to die.\n\nI fell asleep at dawn. I must have slept through the entire day of work. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind with the current scenarios. Hell, being hunted by a cult was probably one of the best excuses there was in the business.\n\nBut, I realized, that I hadn’t woken up to the sun. The buzzing of my phone must have done it. I looked and saw that i had a missed call from an unknown call. It had just happened. The phone started ringing again.\n\nAlmost instinctively I picked it up. That’s what being a 911 operator will do. *What’s the nature of your eme…*\n\n“Hey Marie.” It was the same dark voice from before. I shuddered. It just made the thing more real. Before this call I’d believed of a slim possibility of them just letting it go. Nope. Not a chance. That was clearly not happening. They were not going to let me off the hook. “So, you haven’t been coming home have you?”He could hear my loud breaths, but I didn’t want him to. I didn’t want him to know that I was scared at all, or that this was impacting me. But there was no hiding it. I was having a tough time holding a mental break down away. The breathing was a necessary sacrifice.\n\n“You guys are sick,” I spat. “All of you.”\n\n“Marie. At least we’re not camping out in a car.” A thick arm cloaked in black wrapped around my neck and squeezed. I saw one of the cult members sitting in the back. I couldn’t get any breath. I had already had a tough time getting breath but this made it even more difficult.\n\nI saw him in the car front mirror. He wore a white mask, with black holes as eyes, like scream except the eyes didn’t look like fabric. They looked like the void, and I could see them spinning, circulating slightly.\n\nThe hand stopped squeezing as hard, letting me take nervous breaths, but it remained there, around my neck, and there was absolutely nothing I could do. This was it. This was my death. I knew it.\n\n“So Marie,” they said. “We recognize the value of 911 operators and would not like to hurt the community, *if* you give us a recording of the tape.”\n\n“Sure, fucking fine.”\n\n“I knew you’d come along.”\n\nThe cultist must have entered the car when I was sleeping. I wasn’t sure how they got past the locks without me noticing. Probably some fucking witchcraft involved in that. Although, even though he’d almost taken my life, it was comedic seeing him simply open the car door and stepping out.\n\nHe didn’t follow the road back. He didn’t follow it forward. The man marched off into the woods with a confident walk, as if he knew exactly where to go. He really convinced me that he had somewhere to go, but I doubted it. This was the middle of the woods, and there  was no way they had *so much* control.\n\nHanging up the phone, I drove back to my office, got a tape and sent it over to them. It wasn’t something I was proud over. Honestly, in my dreams I stayed resistant and told them to fuck off, but, it was different in real life.\n\nI wanted to live my life. I guessed when my life was being threatened, just a few seconds away from death, clear death, not some sort of sudden heart attack, things became really clear to me. I wanted to live.\n\nSo I gave them the tape. Again, I’m not proud of it. I personally removed it from our data storage so that I’d never have to relive that terrible moment, but they have it, and they probably love it.\n\nQuite frankly, the more I work this job, the more I understand why nobody around me seems to care one bit about anything happening. Day in, and day out, terrible things happening, monsters, cultists, disasters. It’s all terrifying. It all left me feeling wrong.\n\nBut, you know, I’m just a person. At the end of the day I’m doing this job to pay my wage, just as I thought at the start. There’s just extra complications, extra rules, and you know, when you get good at following them, and when you know the book inside out, it adds a lot of flavor to the job.\n\nI say that, but honestly, I would never ever risk my life again in the way I did. I’ve done it too many times. It’s never paid off. I’ve never changed anything. Actually, I’ve made it significantly worse sometimes.\n\nWhat was that phrasing? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Screw the intentions. Emotions know better. The fright, horror, terror, and dread were clearly there for a reason after all. They told me to stay away.\n\nI’d ignored them once, but now, I listen to them. Their on my side and I know that very well. They’re working to keep me safe from all of the shit out there. Maybe I’m a coward, but at least I’m alive, and that’s way better than a dead man. A fool if you ask me.\n\nBut that philosophical nonsense was just nonsense. I’m just a frightened girl. I don’t know what to do, and honestly, that’s pissed me off. But hey, I don’t know what to do.",

        "text": "Is this the right place to post about a brush with death? I feel like you guys on this reddit can appreciate it, even if there’s no ghosts or tragedies. Ten minutes ago I stepped out of an elevator. I was supposed to die when the cable snapped. I don’t know whether to laugh or—should I be looking over my shoulder the rest of my life, waiting for the other shoe (or elevator) to drop?\n\nLet me explain. Last night, I took a Lyft. Didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary at first. The driver had a smoker’s rasp, floral pastel shirt, lines spider-webbing around her beady eyes—think your kooky aunt who wears too many rings and keeps a stash of vodka in her glovebox. We were talking about making the most of life since you never know how long it’ll be, and she chuckled and said, “Well—actually, I know exactly how long your life’ll be. Your death—I can see it right in your eyes. Anyone’s. Except my own, of course. A mirror’s no good. Has to be the real thing.”\n\n“You can see my death… in my eyes?” I sputtered, incredulous.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Uh, ok. So how do I—”\n\n“B’fore you ask, I gotta warn you, nothing you do can prevent it.”\n\n“Nothing?”\n\n“Nothing,” she said, with smug certainty.\n\n“But how do you know?”\n\n“’Cause I know.” Seeing my skeptical stare in the rearview, she said, “Take the guy I picked up last year. He was flying home to Minnesota. He asked me to tell him, so I said, ‘Your car’s gonna skid on the ice in a terrible snowstorm and you die in the crash.’ Now, this guy, he’s not like you—*you* think I’m talking nonsense. But him, he’s a believer. He takes what I say dead serious, get me? So what’s he do? He gets a separate home for the winter. Stays out of Minnesota. Overwinters in San Antonio. They get maybe five inches of snow a decade. He figures he’s safe.”\n\n“But he wasn’t?”\n\n“Remember last year? What took out the power grid in Texas?”\n\nI did remember when she mentioned it—the freak winter storm that caused power failures all across Texas as temperatures plummeted. \n\n“Funny thing—his car in Minnesota had good tires and handled the snow well. But in San Antonio, he wasn’t prepared for it.” She shrugged. “I read his obituary. May he rest in peace… though he won’t.” Before I could ask what she meant by this ominous remark, she went on, “Then there was the guy last week…”\n\n“What happened to the guy last week?” \n\nThe woman’s eyes twinkled in that way of a street grifter who’s made their mark. “I picked him up from the airport, same as you. Gave him the warning, but he was curious—same as you—so I told him: ‘You die from the bite of a predator.’”\n\n“And?” I was too curious to restrain myself.\n\n“Turns out this guy was planning to go on this safari with his girlfriend. But after my warning, he called her up, right there in the car, and told her he couldn’t go. Oh, you should’ve heard!” She laughed and slapped her thigh. “Hoo boy, was his girl peeved! She told him canceling after they’d already paid wasn’t fair. I told him she was right. He’d better not cancel. Might as well just go on that safari.”\n\n“And did he?” I asked, riveted. “Did he go and get eaten by a lion?”\n\n“Nope. She went alone.” There was a sly glimmer in her eye. “He stayed home and looked after his girlfriend’s cat. The cat bit him. He thought it’d be fine with just some peroxide and rest. Killed him in a day.”\n\n“No way!” I said. “How could a little cat’s bite kill a grown man?” I didn’t believe her, but she told me to look it up, so I did. And… There was the story from last week, in local news. I was horrified. Cat bites can turn deadly in a matter of hours if they become infected. I put my phone away.\n\n“Geez,” I said. For a few minutes I was silent, contemplative. “He shouldn’t have agreed to watch the cat. If it were me, I’d have avoided all animals. Even a rat can be a predator.”\n\n“Smart, you.” She tipped her head toward me. “But don’t matter. It’s like I told the soccer mom yesterday, the one who’s gonna die of rabies—there’s no way to avoid what I see.”\n\n“Why not?” I challenged. “What if the soccer mom locks herself in a room for the rest of her life and never has any exposure to nature?” I knew this wasn’t a logical course of action, of course. But hypothetically. “If she did that, she’d be safe.”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Nope? How nope? You’re saying even in secure isolation somehow some rabid animal would break in, bite her, and give her rabies?”\n\n“Nah—you’re thinking too extreme. It’s a lot simpler than that. It’s always the simple thing. Listen, she was in the car yesterday with me, yeah? And just like you say, she said she was going to avoid all nature and live in the city and never leave her enclosed high rise building. But I told her it wouldn’t help. Then I gave her some water. And I told her funny thing is about rabies, you can get bitten by something with tiny fangs, like a bat, and not even feel it—you don’t even know you’ve been infected. And you might not get sick until, oh, five, six weeks, even months later. Of course the symptoms of rabies look a lot like flu at first, but as it progresses there’s delirium, agitation. And of course the most distinguishing symptom is with water—that’s why they call it hydrophobia—aversion to water. See it spreads through saliva, so the rabies virus makes it so you can’t swallow. Now the woman, she hadn’t touched her bottle. She was looking more and more agitated. She’d been kinda feverish looking since before she got in my car. And I told her, she might be thinking she’s just feeling a touch of the flu and it hurts her throat if she tries to choke anything down—but the thing about rabies is, there’s no treatment once the symptoms show. Sure there’s a vaccine, but you gotta get it immediately, right after exposure. ‘Cause during that loooong incubation period, it’s spreading all through your body, so that by the time you start showing symptoms—you’re already dead.”\n\nI sat silent, appalled. I looked at the water bottle I’d been offered by the driver and that I had already sipped from, and set it down. This whole business about rabies sounded horrific. “You said she was in here yesterday?”\n\nThe driver chuckled. “You think I’d give you a used bottle? C’mon, now. Besides, it’s not how you die.”\n\n“How do I die?” I said, the words out of my mouth before I could stop them.\n\nTo my surprise, she didn’t hem or haw anymore. “You die because the elevator cable snaps.”\n\n“I die… because the cable snaps?” That gave me pause. My building *does* have an elevator. I use it every day. I live on the 10th floor, so climbing the stairs isn’t feasible. I considered my options. Immediately, I found myself thinking about moving to a single-story building or some other location where my traveling in an elevator wouldn’t be necessary. But that wouldn’t work, would it? After all, she already told me stories of people who changed their habits precisely *because* she warned them, with the result that their changed habits caused their own deaths. In fact, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed there was always a catch to her warnings. Suspicious, I asked her, “Why didn’t you tell the safari guy that it was a cat bite? A little more clarity and he might still be alive!”\n\nHer lips curled at the corners, and I swear I saw tiny horns in her mess of dark hair, and she said, “Well son, there’s rules to these things, you know. I tell the truth… it’s up to you to interpret it.”\n\n“Who makes the rules?” I asked.\n\nBut the car screeched to a halt. She tapped her nose. “Think this’s your stop,” she said. I hadn’t even given her the building address—just the general neighborhood name. But here I was. I paid her and got out, and she zipped off before I could ask more questions.\n\nLater I contacted Lyft, but they didn’t have a driver matching her description or any record of the ride that picked me up. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWell. What would you have done? I marched my suitcase over to the elevator and pushed the button. I wasn’t about to carry that damned suitcase up ten flights of steep stairs. I reasoned that, instead of trying to outmaneuver her predictions, I’d pretend not to know about my death-due-to-snapped-elevator-cable. \n\nPretending was hard, though, given the knowledge was already in my brain. I almost fainted when I crossed the threshold, dragging my suitcase into that wobbly, janky old elevator. Every creak and clank sent my heart plummeting. The sixty seconds it took to reach the 10th floor felt as if they stretched on for sixty years, and I was nearly sick on myself when the doors finally opened and I stumbled, pale and shaking, to my flat. Research helped me feel better about my situation later. See, unlike rabies, which really does leave you dead if you’re showing symptoms, or a cat bite, which really can kill you—an elevator plunging you to your death is more of an urban myth. There are backup cables and brakes, so that despite what you see in the movies, it’s essentially impossible for you to go plummeting. I spoke to several elevator technicians, and they all assured me there’s no way for me to die from a snapped cable, short of having a heart attack. And now that I know *that*, my panicking and dying by heart attack is a lot less likely.\n\nAnd here—here comes the bagel—the bagel that I mentioned in the title of this post, which nearly cost my life. See, I didn’t really *need* to go out today. But around lunch time, I craved a bagel. So. \n\nI took the elevator.\n\nI punched in the button for the lobby. I was already imagining what kind of toppings I’d order from the corner bagel shop. No sooner had the doors closed then there was this horrible *CLANG*, and—\n\n—the elevator dropped—\n\n—I was suspended in the air—\n\n—my heart stopped—\n\n—my stomach—I left it hovering somewhere on the 10th floor—\n\n—I cursed all my research and the elevator technicians who’d lied to me—\n\n—then my body slammed into the floor as the elevator car jerked to a halt. I’d only dropped… maybe a few feet? The brake saved me! And though my heart was hammering like the wings of a hummingbird, I think the fact I *knew* the elevator car couldn’t fall prevented me from being as petrified as I would’ve been otherwise. I’m proud to say that I was quite calm as I waited for emergency services to get me out. They’re still repairing the elevator, and despite my anxiety, I plan to ride it again once it’s fixed. Gotta keep on pretending like the cable hasn’t got it out for me right? Haha. Because see now, I’ve proven it is *safe.*\n\nSo sorry this tale doesn’t end in the grim or ghostly, but what a wild ride, eh? And I never even got my bagel! Guess I’ll get it now. Figure I deserve it after all that! The elevator’s probably not operational yet, so for now, it’s the stairs. Hmm… cinnamon raisin or everything…?",

        "text": "I remember thinking it was all a joke. That my boss was deadpanning, and that everyone was together on it. It was just so surreal, so unbelievable. It was nothing like I’d experienced before this. And they told me this, on my second week.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” I told them.\n\n“Most people quit after they hear it.”\n\n“And you thought I wouldn’t because I’ve spent a week here”?  \n“911 operators are necessary. Without us, things get boggled down, calls don’t get heard, or the proper treatment they deserve.”  \n“This isn’t right.”  \n\n\n“I’m willing to live with it,” he said to me. “Are you?”  \nThat was the question. Was I going to keep working here. A huge increase in risk, without an equal increase in pay. Hell not even that. I wasn’t getting any increase in pay whatsoever. But, you know, I couldn’t help but feel curious about it. \n\nHe handed me a book. The cover was black, and it was about an inch thick. It didn’t have a title. I guessed this wasn’t for marketing, or for casual reading. Upon flipping to the first page, I was immediately given an example of a monster calling, and afterwards I was tied to it. \n\nI got the whole week for myself, just to read and learn from that book. My own little type of necronomicon, or I wager, operaticon. I couldn’t believe most of the stories on there. I kept repeating to myself, *this just can’t be true.* \n\nOh, how sweet summer child. \n\nThe first thing I learnt was that you should never, under any circumstances give them your real name. Fake names were a coin toss as far as I could tell, because, they were really nicknames. And what was a name if not the original nickname. \n\nThe way to circumvent this was simply to give someone else name. I gave Petra, my coworkers name, and she gave mine, Marie. You’d think that would be stupid. At the end of the day the creature still has our names, but it’s not the name that’s important. It’s the *giving* of the name. It’s like consenting to something.\n\nSome of the monsters were really insistent on getting my name. That’s how you knew something was up. If they keep asking for your name, even after you’ve given them someone else's name. They got clever in how they did it. \n\nHere’s an example.\n\nDate: 08/21/2022\n\nTime: 22:13\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?” \n\n“Might I ask who I’m speaking to?”  \n“Yes, this is Petra. How might I help you?”   \n“Arghh, wait I didn’t hear you, could you repeat that?”  \n“My name is Petra, sir.”  \n“Arghh, is it alright if I call you Alexandra.”  \n“No my name is Petra. Please refer to me by it.”  \n“You’re a filthy little liar Marie. I’ll find yo-”  \n*Call ended.* \n\nI remember my complexion turning pale white, and my hands shaking as I put down the floor. I decided that I needed a quick break, and stood up from my chair and moved towards the resting room. \n\nPetra stood there, and when she saw my expression, I think she realized what had happened. She hugged me, and I almost broke into sob. In these moments, I’d been advised to think about the reason I’m here, about the times I’ve helped people. \n\n“What happened?” She asked.\n\n“Somebody called asking for my name. I didn’t give them it, and then they somehow knew my name and spat at me.”\n\n“Was their voice dark? And rough?”   \n“Yeah.”  \n\n\n“Did they try to call you Alexandra perchance?”  \n\n\n“Yeah, do you know him?”  \n“That freaks been calling for years now. It was good that you didn’t let him call you Alexandra, that would be the same as giving him a nickname.”\n\n“That’s what I figured.”  \n“He’s one of the milder ones. I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but one time he called a recruit. They came to me later, and told me that they’d given their names, before the call had ended. They didn’t show up the next day.”\n\nSometimes people from another universe would somehow call in. I didn’t know how it worked, but they’d be crying over some sort of disaster, desperately pleading for help. But when help arrived, they’d see nothing off there. \n\nI reckoned it had something to do with multiple phones calling at the same time, maybe the same number, at the same spot. The different types of disasters that had struck humans that sounded just like me was absolutely terrifying. A plague spreading, a meteorite, a tsunami, a storm, something esle deciding it no longer wanted to sit still that type of thing.\n\nBut sometimes the threat’s didn’t come from the phone. They were in the office with the rest of us. I remember one day going to work, and finding an exact replica of myself sitting on the chair, taking calls, smiling, helping.\n\nI tapped her on the shoulder, and when she saw me, she calmly stod up, and walked away. As if nothing had happened. When I asked my co-workers about it, they seemed fairly calm about the whole thing.\n\n“Couldn’t tell you two apart.”  \n\n\nThere’ll be the warning calls. When those come we’re instructed to forward it to some sort of organization. It was usually cults I’d never heard of, warning me of a mistake they’d made when they summoned one of their own. Here’s an example of the more freaky ones. \n\nDate: 02/26/2020\n\nTime: 20:43\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergency?”   \n“Disaster,” the voice on the other side spat. “Little girl. The world as we know it will be destroyed. The whole world as we know it will disappear entirely. They have been released. Unchained. Free. Angry. Furious.”  \n“Sir, could you be more clear.”  \n“Clarity is a sin, not a virtue. Listen little girl. Don’t ever, acknowledge them. Don’t say their names. Hell, the only way you stay safe is by ignoring them. Do you understand?”  \n“Sir, could you describe them a little bit more.”  \n“That I can not do.”  \n“Are they around you?”  \n“...”  \n“If they’re around you, tell me you couldn’t hear I just said.”  \n“I didn’t catch that.”\n\n“How many?”  \n“One hundred:”  \n“Where are you?”  \n“Far beneath Washington:”  \n\n\n“Verywell sir, I will be connecting you to those proficient in dealing with these matters. Please hang on.”  \nI didn’t hear much about this afterwards. There didn’t seem to be any consequences of it. Until, a picture of a large, gray, statue looking creature, being shot down, was posted online. I had a terrible feeling then.\n\nYou’ll get the normal horrors, the expected ones. A girl calling after failing to wake her dead mother, or a serial killer wanting to brag. You know the worst part about those? I just couldn’t care anymore.\n\nI felt like I’d been on a vile gore sight, and then, I saw a common wound. It just didn’t elicit any emotions within me. It felt childish almost. It shouldn’t, but it did. I worried during those moments. I felt there was something seriously wrong with my head. I couldn’t help but think that wasn’t just a feeling.\n\nSometimes I wasn’t allowed to hang up. Sometimes hanging up meant pissing the other end off, and with some creatures that was the last thing you wanted to. They’d sit there and describe their horrific act in detail, as if they had all the time in the world, and I was forced to sit there and listen. Nothing else I could do. Absolutely nothing.\n\nIf they told you to keep listening, or to turn the call off, you had no choice in the matter. Hell, sometimes they could sense if you weren’t paying full attention, and they’d stop and ask you about it. *Marie, are you paying attention?*\n\nOne time, I’d heard one of my co-workers throw the phone against a wall. Their face was red, and they looked seconds away from shrieking. Even when we tried to talk to them about it, they wouldn’t budge.\n\nThe next day they called me, panicking. I could hear some sort of shrieking noise from the background. The call ended abruptly. I never heard from them again.\n\nThat was the thing that scared me the most. It was something entirely different to have somebody you cared for disappear. It was just as real as the death’s you heard about, logically, but psychologically, it wasn’t a number or a name disappearing. It was a person, their identity and personality perishing alongside.And my brain understood that. Not just in an intellectual way.    \nSo yeah, I never hanged up first, except for one time, one time I was supposed to hang up. It was if the caller on the other side said goodbye. A simple word, but one that had to be respected. As you could assume, there was consequences to not following that rule. They found you disrespectful.\n\nThe ones that told you when to hangup always spoke slowly. That was the way you’d identify them. I don’t know what the hell they were. Probably some sort of sick monster. No. Certainly some sort of sick monster, but one that really valued their goodbyes.\n\nCompared to the other ones, they’re not all that bad. They really just call in to speak about their day, and how it’s gone. It’s a regular conversation. Nothing odd about it. Forward and back, forward, and back, until the goodbye.\n\nAnd that’s the end. Always. Not ending the call at goodbye’s like not turning the car when there’s a cliff ahead. Certain peril. No question about it. It was a really stupid way to go about things, and I really disliked it. It’s tricky. It really is. But that’s the way things went here. \n\nOne time I didn’t follow that call. After I shut off the call. Something strange happened. My screen turned black for a mere second. It just shut off, and then I was back on the call with the same person as before, although the calm tone was entirely gone. By the time I’d realized what my mistake was, I couldn’t do anything about it. Damn it.   \nThe exhaustion that had made me commit the mistake, decided to not stick around, dissapearing the second I realized what was happening. The slick bastard. My heart hammered, and my voice shook. It was the first time I’d broken the rules, and I really hoped that it wouldn’t go down badly.\n\nThey spoke with anger. “So you think we’re worthless?”   \n“No, please, it was a mistake.”  \n\n\n“Bullshit! You think we’re worthless, not worth your time, huh? I’ll show you what happens when you disrespect me in such a way.”  \n\n\nAnd then the call ended, leaving me pondering what the hell it was they would do me. Was it going to be murder, and if so how? Would they decapitate my head, or stab me and let me slowly bleed to death, or would they poision me and turn my body blue, or would they tie weights to my ankles and toss me into the ocean for the sharks to eat.\n\nMaybe it would be worse. Maybe they’d abduct me, and torture me for hours on end. I’d heard calls of torture victims. Their voice had a certain quality to it. It sounded entirely broken. There was no confdicen or spirit in there any longer.\n\nI had no doubts that would happen to me. People had a wrong conception that they’d be able to survive torture. No. Not a chance. I couldn’t pinch my arm for more than ten seconds without wanting to scream out in pain. What if that happened for hours on end, day after day. I’d lose it. Something inside of my brain would snap. I’d stop functioning. My eyes would lose their glint, and drool would slowly escape my lips without my having any clue about it. \n\nThat’s the type of person I could become, and that prospect terrified me like nothing else. Just the mere thought of it happening was enough to dose me full of anxiety and stress, and I didn’t want to deal with that like whatsoever. \n\nI needed to make things right before they did. How though. I tried calling the number back but of course I got no response. Fortunatley, we had a type of emergancy tool we could use to locate the phone’s location. It used GPS, although I’m not going to act like I understood it at all. Although I’ll say right now, that I had never been more thankful for the feature.\n\nThe call was coming from town. From an abandoned building, and I knew that I had to head there, or that something infinitly terrible would happen to me. \n\nIt was a strange thing to fight against my own body in this manner. The parts of me unable to understand reason though this was terrible idea. Heading straight into the forest, was absolutely terrible. And also terrifying. \n\nMy feet were heavy, and refused to lift from their spot. I had to strain with each single step towards the spot  My body shivered and shook. My heart deafened me. It was one thing to fall to death, it was another thing entirely to walk to it.   \nEventually I reached the abandoned house, and I stood right outside of the door as the rain pe\n\nIt rained outside. That was something I realized as I stood in front of the door to the abandoned house. I hadn’t even noticed that until I reached the door. It was like somebody was playing a game with me. I didn’t like it one bit. Not right now. Not when the truth could be falsehood, and falsehood, could be the truth.\n\nThat’s the thing with creature’s like this. You never know exactly what to expect. It could be the best thing ever. That was probably how the monsters experienced it. Just free food. Free undefensible food. For what the hell were you supposed to do when faced with the unknown, and ununderstandable. I sure as hell didn’t know. Pray for the best maybe?  \n\n\nMaybe that’s why gods were such a wide spread phenomenon. Humans needed something, someway of combatting these creatures. And they found an answer that could work everytime. A promise that everything would turn out well. Not given to you by another human. That would be worthless. No. It was given by the big guy upstairs.\n\nI knocked on the door, but I got no answer, but footsteps came from deeper within the house. I knew for a fact that there was something there. I cringed, and my body took three steps backwards without me knowing about it. It just never came into my awareness.\n\nI knocked again, careful not to break the door. If hanging up on this creature was enough to get me killed. Then I wouldn’t want to imagine what breaking its door would do. Whatever chance of forgiveness I had would dissapear.\n\nWood creaked, and I prepared myself. Something was approaching the door. I put on a smile. I didn’t think it would convince them, but at least it would partially hide the absolute horror covering my face.\n\nThe door opened. Dread. Horror. Terror. A fake smile. Shock?\n\nThere was a human standing there. Her face dripped of blood, and her hair was lose. I don’t think there was more than ten hair strands. It looked to be in terrible condition. I thought my smile was terrible, but hers was even worse. She looked scared. More scared than I’d ever been in my life.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to do.\n\n“Hello?”  \n   \n“What?” she spat.\n\n“I’m the 911 operator somebody in this house called.”  \n“And?”  \n“I’ve come to apologize for my rude behaviour.”  \n“Hmm. I will speak to it for you.”  \nMy head jerked right when I heard the shutters on the window to my right rustle. *Had it been watching me?* My body unwillingly shook with disgust. The girl saw my response and frowned. *Fuck fuck fuck.*\n\nShe was about to shut the door when I gripped it, and held it open. I couldn’t let things end like this. It wasn’t hard to open it up, matter of fact, she was remarkably weak. When I looked at her arm, I noticed only bones. \n\n“You don’t deserve this,” I whispered with a shaky voice. *Let’s hope its hearing isn’t great.* \n\nShe didn’t say anything. *Damn, why aren’t you saying anyhting? What are you thinking?*   \nI kept talking. “You know that thing’s a monster. I can get you out of here.”  \n“Really?” she whispered back, her eyes turning glossy.   \n“Yes,” I said, happy that I’d gotten though.\n\n“Alright, wait here, I’ll go and talk with it.”  \n\n\nThe door closed, and i heard her walking away and to the room to the right. They spoke in whispers. Her tone was entirely different from the way she’d spoken with me. Instead of spitting, or cursing, she was calm and pleasant, as if she was talking to a temperamental hchild.\n\nShe walked back to the door and opened it. “It wants to see you.”  \nI swallowed dry saliva and stepped inside. She clutched my arm and pulled me close. “Don’t break eye contact.”  \nThe creature wasn’t what I’d expected. It certainly wasn’t threatening. It was barely half a meter tall, had one eye, was bald, and walked quickly on two legs. It looked at me with an eye of scrutiny. \n\nI didn’t know if I should laugh or jerk back in disgust. Was *this* the thing I was so terrified about?   \n\n\n“Chloe,” It said, “go make us tea.”  \n“Verywell Master.”  \nWhen she had left, he came closer to me. I made sure to keep eye contact, and no matter how much I wanted to scoot away from the filthy little rat, I stayed still. I didn’t want to piss it off just in case.\n\n“You know I heard you,” it said. “You called me a monster.”  \n“No you mus-”  \nHis hands were on my neck, clenching. I couldn’t breathe. There was a lot a force in his wrists, much more than I had assumed. I hadn’t seen him move. Not a blur. Not out of him being too fast. No.\n\nOur positions were different. He wasn’t standing in front of me. He was standing on the couch beside me, and his hand extended to my neck clenching. It had all been instantaenous, like all the moments inbetween had been removed.\n\n“But,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I trusted her? I gave her a home. I fed her, and she stabbed me in the back?”  \n*Fed her?* \n\nI couldn’t. At that moment by fear semeed to shift somehow. Instead of running away I wanted to fight somehow. Through a strained voice, I gave him a piece of my mind.\n\n“Feed? Really. Are you fucking joking me? She looks fucking starved.”\n\n“My woman can’t weigh more than me!”  \n\n\n“You’re fucking disgusting!”  \n\n\n“I understand for you humans this doesn’t make much sense, but understand something about me. I’m not a human, this is how we operate. Get that through your head.”  \n“Fuck you.”  \nHis clenched tightened. I tried to suck air, but nothing came out. My face began turning white.\n\n“But it was my wife’s fault for letting you in. She will be punished for her acts, and yours.”  \n“F-fuck you.”  \n\n\n“That doesn’t mean you get to walk away free. What should I do to you little bird?”   \n“F-f--f-”  \n“I know. You’re complaining about her not eating enough. We can fix that. Chloe, come here.”  \nBetween sobs she answered. She must have heard the entire exhchange. “Yes Master.”  \n\n\n“Eat her hand.”  \nThat was the last thing I remembered. It wasn’t that I passed out. No. That wretched creature must have removed my memories, but when I regained it. I saw a stump where my left hand was supposed to be.\n\nImages of her mouth closing in around my hand floated in and out like hallucinations. In those momentary dreams, I was frozen solid, having to watch the scene go down. I felt the dampness of her mouth. The saliva tickling my skin. The snapping of my bones.\n\nI threw up whatever food I had in my gut. I reckoned she did the same. \n\nI made sure not to hang up on any number after that. I also got into the habit of sending teams to those monsters occasionally. The type of teams specialized in hunting those disgusting things.\n\nI wasn’t supposed to do that. Those teams were there primarily for disaster preventation. The government thought that as long as these monster’s aren’t actively hurting other people, it’s fine, and we should let them live.\n\nNot a chance. Not even one. I stopped caring about lying, and I just tried to get as many of them killed as possible. I couldn’t do it too much, or I’d be fired. I’d do it enough to get to the edge of being fired, before I stopped, and let their anger for me reset.\n\nThere wasn’t many willing to do my job, so I that was probably why I still had it. There was a perk to being neccessary and not easily replacable, and that was that I had way less shits to care about. I could keep going until I became more of a harm than a threat.\n\nIt reminded me of another time. Sometimes when people call in, the terrible act hasn’t happened yet, just the start. The preset. What happens before, and as they describe their situation. I realize more and more what’s going on.\n\nThere’s usually nothing to be done. Death was usually the best thing waiting for them. Nowadays, I just try to lead them to a moment of calm, before their life ends. Let them enjoy the little time.\n\nIn the past, I was naive. I thought I could save these people if I gave them instructions. Failure after failure segmeneted in my mind that it wasn’t possible. That some disasters were to be accepted, not avoided. \n\nIt was hard. Especailly when there was children involved. To hear three, two, four children crying and begging for help. It just sucked something out of you. I couldn’t. I’d cry and shut off the phone. I just couldn’t. Not then, but now, I try to calm them.\n\nI lie to them. I know it’s not right. I should probably just be straight forward with them. But I can’t. Honestly, I find it a lot better to tell them a sweet lie, than to say, *you’re about to be murdered, eaten, abducted, tortured, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do. I’m going to hang up now so that I can actually help people.* \n\nYeah. That would be worse than a lie. Nothing could convince me otherwise. I think when it dawned on me how useless my advice really was, was when a person called me about cult activity. This time it wasn’t a cult that had messed up, it was a soon-to-be victim of a cult calling in and begging for help.\n\nBelieve it or not, we’re contractually obligiated to ignore those calls.  But that’s more legal shit. It just makes it impossible for the state to use the information gained from those calls to sue the cult. Nobody here actually followed that rule. Fuck those freaks.\n\n“911, what is the nature of your emergancy?”  \n“There’s faces in the windows.”  \n\n\n“I’m sorry sir?” I said, and put him on loud-speaker. It was early in the morning, and there wasn’t many calls coming in. I didn’t put him on speaker to entetrain the rest of the speakers. I put him on speaker becasue I knew this wasn’t going to be an average call, and everybody’s experience and expertise would be needed. “Please say that again.”  \n“White faces. I think there masks. Pushed against the window. Black eyes. I can’t see the rest of their body.”  \nMy coworker, Tom, pushed the mute button as he said, “This seems like the black moon cult. These fuckers are vicious. We could send the cops there, but they’ll probably be done by the time the cops arrive.”  \nHe removed his finger from the mute button. “Alright sir, could you tell me your adress.”  \n“\\[Redacted\\]”\n\n“Alright, cops are on their way. Alright, are you alone at home.”  \n“No. My wife is here, and my three children. Two boys, and one baby girl. They’re currently shelted into the upstairs room.”  \n\n\nPetra pressed the mute button. “Wait, isn’t that the cult that watches people get slaughtered.  \n\n\n“Yup,” Tom said. “They’ve planted people all over the house.d   \n\n\nSnatching his hand, I pulled it away from the button. “Grab a weapon.”  \n\n\n“What?”  \n“I said grab a weapon. A gun preferably. Not a knife, absolutely not a knife. Something long and blunt. A frying pan.”  \n\n\n“We’ve got a frying pan,” he said, as I heard him rush over to the kitchen and grab it. “Why do I need it?”  \n“Go to your family now!”  \n   \n3 kids, one mother, was a goddamn wet dream for these sick bastards. They were easy prey up there. One of the cult members would crawl out of the corner they hid in, approach the family, and slash into them, causing all havoc. He needed to make it there in time. \n\nThe upside to blunt weapons was that they could knock people out. After they were knocked out, they had no defense. Somebody with no defense could easily be taken care off. It was way better than a knife. Sure you’d kill the other person, but not quickly enough for them to not seriously hurt you back, even kill you.\n\nI heard him rushing up the stairs, and jerking a door open.  He breathed heavily. “Oh thank god.”  \n“Are they safe?”  \n“They’re safe.”  \n“Great. Lock the door.”  \n“Why?”  \n“Just do it.”  \nHe slammed the door shut, and I heard the lock snap into place. There was crying in the background. I’d take a guess it was the baby crying. Poor thing. I really hoped that things would turn out well.\n\n“Alright,” I said. “What I’m about to say will freak you out.”  \n\n\n“?”  \n\n\n“One of them is in the room already.”  \n“What!” He said. I could imagine his head jerking around, as he tried to figure out what happened. But, then another noise took his attention. They broke the door of their house open, and I could hear multiple men rushing in. His breath quickened.\n\n“Search the room carefully. Check under the bed, check the ceiling, the wardrobe, everywhere. Remember. Cops are on their way. Just survive long enough.”  \n“Fuck fuck fuck,” he said, his voice getting further away from the phone, occasionally. HE was really searching the house.\n\n“I need you to calm down.” Christ. The words sounded ridiculous even as I said them, but it was true. He needed to calm down. It was necessary. Panic wouldn’t do him any good, except for strengthening his muscles for a strike.  \n“I am fucking calm!” He spat. I could hear him stomping around the room. Suddenly, his wife shrieked. I knew something terrible had happened. “You fucking bastard.”\n\nThe sound of metal smashing bone was a satisfying one on movie. In real life it was a gnarly, disgusting sound, that made you cringe with disgust, and jerk away from the sound as much as possible. There would be one thunk, and then another, as the head smashed against the floor.\n\n“You fucking bastard,” the man spat. The frying pan banged into flesh again, and again, and again.\n\nThe door to their bedroom began shaking. I could hear the people on the other side desperately tying to get through.”\n\nTom pressed the mute button. “I reckon we should end the call here.”  \n“We can’t just abandon him!”  \n“He’s already dead. The last thing we want is to catch the attention of those sick fucks.”\n\n“FUCK THEM,” I stood up screaming. “This isn’t right.”  \n“It’s never been. Welcome to the world sunshine. Now hang up.”\n\n“No.”  \nPetra joined the conversation. “Hey. I think he’s got a point. There’s no saving them at this point.”  \n“We can try. How far away are the police?”\n\n“Ten minutes.”  \n“We can work with that,” I said and unmuted. “Tom you there? Tom, hello?”  \nI hadn’t been paying attention the noise. I just heard screaming. Raw, guttural screaming. That couldn’t be good, but who knew who it was screaming. The cultists or Tom. Alright, I knew. I knew.  \n\n\n“Hello,” A deep voice came back. Not Tom. “This is 911 yes?”  \n“What are you going to say that I broke the rules?”  \n“That you did, but this was simply excellent. The fury, the passion, the raw emotion this man displayed was simply delicious. We’d like a recording of the call.”  \n\n\n“Fuck no,” I said. “Fuck all of you. You’re not going to get shit.”  \n“You’re going to regret saying that.”  \nThat was the last thing he said before I ended the call. At the moment, rage filled me, and made me not care for his threat. It felt like such a small thing. Entirely meaningless in front of my rage. This piece of shit was going to get it. \n\nI walked around the office fantasizing of all the ways I would get this fuck. I would send every goddamn agency made for this at them, and I’d make sure their entire cult collapsed. Oh, how I’d fucking destroy them.\n\nThen my rage disappeared, and I couldn’t believe what I’d done. I’d rejected the wishes of a cult. A cult so established they were included in the black book. Oh christ. I was dead. They’d play their sick little game on me. Ahh fuck. They’d probably already found where I lived, and went there.\n\n“I can’t go home,” I muttered to myself. Home meant death. Something that was a mere game to those freaks. No. I’d have to stay in the car until this whole thing quieted down, and they relaxed. That was the plan.   \n\n\nThat was what I ended up doing. I sat in my car, with the engine on, stopped at a road. I was in a spot where I could see my surroundings clearly. Nobody would be sneaking up on me, that was for sure. \n\nMy panic wouldn’t let me sleep for the whole night. I sat in the chair, my pupils jerking in all directions, expecting the cultists to pop up at any moment. Despite my brave front earlier, I really didn’t want to die. \n\nI fell asleep at dawn. I must have slept through the entire day of work. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind with the current scenarios. Hell, being hunted by a cult was probably one of the best excuses there was in the business.\n\nBut, I realized, that I hadn’t woken up to the sun. The buzzing of my phone must have done it. I looked and saw that i had a missed call from an unknown call. It had just happened. The phone started ringing again. \n\nAlmost instinctively I picked it up. That’s what being a 911 operator will do. *What’s the nature of your eme…* \n\n“Hey Marie.” It was the same dark voice from before. I shuddered. It just made the thing more real. Before this call I’d believed of a slim possibility of them just letting it go. Nope. Not a chance. That was clearly not happening. They were not going to let me off the hook. “So, you haven’t been coming home have you?”  \nHe could hear my loud breaths, but I didn’t want him to. I didn’t want him to know that I was scared at all, or that this was impacting me. But there was no hiding it. I was having a tough time holding a mental break down away. The breathing was a necessary sacrifice. \n\n“You guys are sick,” I spat. “All of you.”  \n“Marie. At least we’re not camping out in a car.”  \nA thick arm cloaked in black wrapped around my neck and squeezed. I saw one of the cult members sitting in the back. I couldn’t get any breath. I had already had a tough time getting breath but this made it even more difficult. \n\nI saw him in the car front mirror. He wore a white mask, with black holes as eyes, like scream except the eyes didn’t look like fabric. They looked like the void, and I could see them spinning, circulating slightly.\n\nThe hand stopped squeezing as hard, letting me take nervous breaths, but it remained there, around my neck, and there was absolutely nothing I could do. This was it. This was my death. I knew it. \n\n“So Marie,” they said. “We recognize the value of 911 operators and would not like to hurt the community, *if* you give us a recording of the tape.”  \n“Sure, fine.”  \n“I knew you’d come along.”  \nThe cultist must have entered the car when I was sleeping. I wasn’t sure how they got past the locks without me noticing. Probably some fucking witchcraft involved in that. Although, even though he’d almost taken my life, it was comedic seeing him simply open the car door and stepping out. \n\nHe didn’t follow the road back. He didn’t follow it forward. The man marched off into the woods with a confident walk, as if he knew exactly where to go. He really convinced me that he had somewhere to go, but I doubted it. This was the middle of the woods, and there  was no way they had *so much* control.\n\nHanging up the phone, I drove back to my office, got a tape and sent it over to them. It wasn’t something I was proud over. Honestly, in my dreams I stayed resistant and told them to fuck off, but, it was different in real life.\n\nI wanted to live my life. I guessed when my life was being threatened, just a few seconds away from death, clear death, not some sort of sudden heart attack, things became really clear to me. I wanted to live.\n\nSo I gave them the tape. Again, I’m not proud of it. I personally removed it from our data storage so that I’d never have to relive that terrible moment, but they have it, and they probably love it.\n\nQuite frankly, the more I work this job, the more I understand why nobody around me seems to care one bit about anything happening. Day in, and day out, terrible things happening, monsters, cultists, disasters. It’s all terrifying. It all left me feeling wrong. \n\nBut, you know, I’m just a person. At the end of the day I’m doing this job to pay my wage, just as I thought at the start. There’s just extra complications, extra rules, and you know, when you get good at following them, and when you know the book inside out, it adds a lot of flavor to the job.\n\nI say that, but honestly, I would never ever risk my life again in the way I did. I’ve done it too many times. It’s never paid off. I’ve never changed anything. Actually, I’ve made it significantly worse sometimes.\n\nWhat was that phrasing? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Screw the intentions. Emotions know better. The fright, horror, terror, and dread were clearly there for a reason after all. They told me to stay away.\n\nI’d ignored them once, but now, I listen to them. Their on my side and I know that very well. They’re working to keep me safe from all of the shit out there. Maybe I’m a coward, but at least I’m alive, and that’s way better than a dead man. A fool if you ask me. \n\nBut that philosophical nonsense was just nonsense. I’m just a frightened girl. I don’t know what to do, and honestly, that’s pissed me off. But hey, I don’t know what to do.",

        "text": "Has anyone else received a strange email or a text message recently?  Something telling you to click on a link?  \n\nIf you click on it, or if someone you know clicks on it, they’re never the same afterwards.  \n\nI’m guessing it’s like doing crystal meth, and suddenly your brain is flooded with so many endorphins and feel-good hormones that nothing ever feels okay again except for that sensation.  And suddenly that's all you want ALL THE TIME.\n\nI haven’t watched it yet, but my wife did.  And now she’s not herself anymore.  I don’t know how else to explain it.  \n\nI came home from work early last week and she was sitting on the couch staring at the television screen.  I didn’t pay attention to what she was watching at the time.\n\n“Hey, Christine,” I said, setting my work bag down on the bench by the door. \n\nUsually she would pause what she was watching to get up and greet me.  Or at least she would say hello.  But this time she stayed silent, and I wondered if I had done something inadvertently to upset her.  \n\n“How was your day?” I tried next, attempting to smile.  \n\nShe didn’t say anything, instead just continuing to stare straight ahead, looking at the television with a dopey expression on her face.  \n\n“Okay…” I sighed and went to the back room where I had a laptop set up for writing.  \n\nIf she was gonna give me the silent treatment I could give it back to her double, I thought bitterly.  I sat down and opened a document, then began typing, pressing the keys louder and harder than necessary.  \n\nAfter working on my project for a while I went back out to the living room, hoping to make peace.  But Christine was still wrapped up in whatever show she was watching, completely ignoring me.  \n\nHer earbuds were cordless and so I assumed she had them in and was listening to the television using them, since there was no sound coming from the glowing screen.  It faced away from me and I refused to look at it, more out of principle now than anything else.  \n\nI waved my hand in front of her face, jokingly at first, then with more and more annoyance, thinking surely that would snap her out of it and she would talk to me, but she didn’t.  \n\nEver since Christine had been diagnosed with her chronic illness, shortly after her mom passed away, she was looking for various routes of escape.  Ways to ignore the pain.\n\nIt was never anything too bad.  There was a bit of weed and drinking at the start, but then she found other methods of distraction.  Video games and TikTok, YouTube and podcasts - those things became like another world to her, which she could slip away into and pretend like nothing else existed.  \n\nWhen I tried to break her out of these periods of hyper-fixation, she would stubbornly ignore me, similar to how she was acting now.  Especially when she was feeling really down, or if I had upset her.  \n\nWhy was she being like this again? I wondered to myself.  \n\nHad I forgotten her birthday, or our anniversary?  I mentally checked the calendar and that wasn’t it.  \n\nHad I been neglecting my household chores?  Had I forgotten to pick up dinner or done something else wrong?\n\nThinking back over my recent actions, I couldn't think of anything.  There was no reason for her to be acting this way.  \n\nSo I went to the kitchen and made myself a frozen pizza for dinner, telling her there was some left for her if she wanted it, as I took a plate to the back room with me.  Her silence followed after me, like a cold, lonely breeze.\n\nI watched YouTube videos and ate the frost-burnt, overcooked pizza, feeling even more bitter than before.  \n\nThat night I went to bed upset.  I tossed and turned for most of the night, getting little sleep. \n\nThe bed usually felt much warmer, but that night I just couldn’t get comfortable.  \n\n*\n\nThe following day I got up early to leave for the airport.  \n\nI had a work trip and I would be gone for a few days.  Normally Christine would drive me, but she was still sitting in front of the television, ignoring me.  \n\n“Have you been up all night watching TV?” I asked, putting on my shoes.  \n\nShe didn’t reply.  \n\nPart of me wanted to sit down next to her and take a minute to try again to communicate with her, but my flight was leaving soon and I needed to leave.  I didn't have time for stupid arguments, especially when I wasn't the one at fault.\n\n“Okay, I’m going,” I said.  “I’ll see you in a few days.”\n\nShe didn’t turn her head to look, as I closed the door behind me and locked it, sealing her inside with the glowing screen in the darkness.  \n\n*\n\nMy trip was extended by two days longer than expected, and I didn’t get home until yesterday.  \n\nWhen I opened the door and entered the living room, I was in for a shock.  \n\nI dropped my bags to the floor, my breath escaping my lungs with a soft gasp.  \n\n“Christine?...”\n\nShe had not moved.  It had been almost a week, and she was in the exact same place as before.  If she had gotten up to eat or drink, there was no indication of it.  \n\nI went over to her on the couch, my eyes running up and down the length of her, taking in the horrifying details.  \n\nHer cheeks were sunken in, her eyes rimmed with dark circles like a raccoon.  The T-shirt she was wearing was the same as the one she’d had on when I left, but now I could see her ribs showing through the white, sweat-stained fabric.  \n\nChristine’s mousy-brown hair was matted and flattened at the back from being pressed against the cushions, and her lips were dry, cracked, and bleeding.  With her mouth hanging agape I could see she had somehow lost the majority of her teeth, which were lying bloody on the floor by her feet.  \n\n“Christine,” I said again, reaching to pull her earbuds out so she could hear me better.  \n\nWhen I reached forward to grab them, my hand brushed against her hair and a clump of it fell out immediately, and then another large piece came loose and tore off after that.  \n\nThe screen was still glowing brightly behind me.  Somehow it didn’t even occur to me that there could be something wrong with what she was watching.  That something on the screen could be causing what was happening to her.  \n\nI thought she was having a mental break of some kind.  Scared for her well-being at this point, I did the one thing I hoped I would never have to do.  I called 9-1-1 and told them to send an ambulance. \n\nWhen the paramedics arrived I answered the front door of the apartment and let them in.  \n\n“She’s just in here,” I said, leading them into the living room.  “It looks like she hasn’t eaten since I left for my trip, a week ago.  She needs to see a doctor.”\n\nI froze in place, completely stunned when I saw Christine was now sitting upright on the couch, looking healthy, despite the missing clump of hair on the right side of her head, her sunken cheekbones and cracked, bleeding lips.  \n\nShe hid all of those things with a smile, and the glow from the television changed in an instant to cast her face in a luminous glow which made her look healthy and even beautiful again.  \n\n“She looks fine to me,” the taller paramedic of the two said.  He had blonde hair and a handsome face, and he walked over to inspect her more closely.  \n\n“Are you okay?” he asked.  “Your boyfriend here called 9-1-1.”\n\n“Husband,” I interjected.  “I’m her husband.  And she’s not okay.  She wasn’t even responding before.  I don’t know what’s going on but she didn’t look like this a few minutes ago.”\n\nThe other paramedic grabbed my arm a little roughly and led me outside the apartment.  \n\n“What happened to her hair?” he asked when we were outside.  “It looks like someone pulled it out.”\n\n“That was me,” I said, then immediately bit my tongue.  “I mean, I just brushed my hand against it and suddenly a whole clump of hair fell out.  She’s lost a ton of weight since I left.  Do you think she might have cancer?”\n\n“I’m more worried about you,” the paramedic said.  “You look awful.  Have you been drinking at all tonight?  Doing any drugs?”\n\n“NO!” I practically screamed at him.  “Why would you ask me that?”\n\n“Sir, most people don’t call 9-1-1 when their wife isn’t speaking to them.  You're very worked up right now.  I’m just worried you’re gonna do something you’ll regret later.  Do you have somewhere else you can go?  Some place you can spend the night?  I don’t feel comfortable leaving you two alone here.  Given what you said I won’t get the police involved, as long as you find somewhere else to go tonight.  I’m worried this is more of a domestic argument than a medical issue.”\n\nI argued with him a little while longer but it was pointless, he wouldn’t budge, only saying the police would be called if I didn’t leave, hinting that my statement to him would be grounds to spend the night in jail.  Eventually I got in my car and left with just the clothes on my back, driving to a friend’s house to spend the night.  Luckily Dave didn't ask any questions, since I was in no state to explain.  \n\nAs I tried to sleep that night on Dave's couch, I found it difficult to think of anything but Christine back at the apartment.  Still staring at that television screen probably.  More teeth falling out and more clumps of hair dropping from her head as her brain rotted inside her skull.  \n\nThe glow of the TV screen casting her face in green light and making her look like a zombie.\n\nWait…\n\nThat was it.  \n\nThe television.  \n\nThat was when I realized it was the thing on the television screen that was making her act so strangely.  The odd glow it cast on her face to make her appear normal when the paramedics were there, not to mention the fact that all of this had started that night when I came home from work to find her staring at the screen which was hooked up to our laptop.  \n\nWhatever she was watching, it was changing her.  And not for the better. \n\nIf not for something I read on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xijimo/viral_video/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) a while back, I might not have made the connection.  But after putting two and two together, I knew it had to be so.  \n\nMy wife was the unwitting victim of a deadly VIRAL VIDEO.  \n\nNever in my wildest dreams would I have thought I'd encounter it myself.  A YouTube video that turns your mind into a husk, filling it with only one purpose.  \n\nSPREAD THE VIRUS.\n\n*\n\nI drove back to the apartment shortly after that realization.  The sky was overcast and there was a cold wind blowing that made me suspect we were going to receive rain soon.  \n\nWhen I parked outside, I saw the ambulance was still parked by the door, in the same place where it was when I left.  \n\nPulling the collar of my coat tighter around my neck, I left my car with a sinking feeling in my gut.  A chill ran up my spine as I rode the elevator up to the third floor, getting off and approaching the apartment on wobbly legs.  \n\nAs I pushed open the door, a strong, coppery smell hit my nose immediately.  \n\nMy heart began to tick faster as I took a few shaky steps through the entry hall, and into the living room.  \n\nThe two paramedics from the day before were sitting cross-legged in front of the television screen like children watching Saturday morning cartoons, except their eyes were bleeding, their smiling, gap-toothed mouths shedding teeth which fell to the floor occasionally, making little clinking sounds.  \n\nTheir faces were bathed in the glowing light of the television screen, and they didn’t even seem to notice me as I carefully entered the room, avoiding looking at the TV at all costs.  \n\nChristine was lying on the couch with her head turned toward the screen.  I wondered if she was too weak even to sit up now, and had that’s why she had finally changed her position.  \n\nPart of me wanted to step in front of the television, blocking her view of it.  Or to turn it off entirely.  But another part of me said that would be a very bad idea.  \n\nShe looked like she was doped up on heroin.\n\nI had seen YouTube clips of people receiving Naloxone after ODing on opioids.  The videos were mostly taken in the ER and the people receiving the opioid reversal drug reacted violently when their high was taken away.  Even though doctors and nurses were saving them, these people attacked the hospital staff around them, trying to kill them.  \n\nI wondered if Christine and the two paramedics would react the same way if I turned off the television.  Would they try to kill me?  Or would they hold me down and MAKE me watch?\n\nMy eyes drifted over to the faces of the two paramedics.  One of them had glasses and the reflection showed the flickering images on screen, and I made the mistake of focusing on those images, for just an instant.  \n\nAt least, it felt like an instant in my mind.  \n\nWhen I came to my senses I realized the light in the room had shifted, the shadows now cast in a different direction.  It was sunny outside, no longer overcast.  \n\nI looked down to check the time and saw three of my teeth on the floor at my feet, looking up at me and smiling.  The blood sprinkled on them made them look giddy and excited as they laughed.  \n\n\"Watch it some more,\" the chipped front tooth said.  \n\n\"Don't stop.  Don't ever stop,\" the molar beside it joined in.  \"The real thing is so much better than a reflection.  You've only seen a glimpse.  Join them.  Sit.  Watch.  Forever.\"\n\nI almost did, but then my wits returned again thankfully.  Whatever dose of the viral video I'd received was not enough to take over my mind instantly, but it was close.  \n\nThere's no way to resist it.  I can feel myself giving in.  I can feel it taking over.  I will join them in a moment.  As scared as I am of what will happen to me, of what I'll lose, I know I have no choice.  \n\nBut I have enough strength left in me to get this out there.  To share this with you all.  \n\nIt's important that you know.  \n\nDon't watch the viral [video.](https://youtu.be/BCymr6k8KN8)",

        "text": "My dog ran away last year, she's a Great Dane, about 2 years old. For a while we looked for her all over the neighborhood and all over the city. We put up wanted posters for her lost dog posters with a high price because we valued her very much. Last night she was at our front door, we were so excited to see her. We let her into the house to gave her treats gave her food gave her water it seems like I was the only person who noticed something off about her before her eyes were a very pretty blue like a huskies but now they're brown a dark brown, the kind of brown wear it's almost black but not quite. I didn't want to say anything to ruin the moment because my family thought it was our dog she responded to her name, sky, we named her that because of her eyes. It was weird, so weird that I didn't sleep that night. My dog used to sleep at the end of my bed, she'd climb up with her big self and curl up into a ball on on my bed and she would lay her head on my feet. She didn't do that last night. Last night she climbed up on my bed like she usually did but instead of laying down and settling in for sleep she sat there staring at me with those black brown eyes it was scary. I eventually went to bed after just riding it off as her getting used to the place again. I shouldn't have done that. I woke up at 4:00 in the morning to my dog standing over me growling, her slobber was all over my face. She'd never growled at me before so I was very scared but I couldn't move because I knew that you would overpower me. Her teeth showed through her jowls and I quite frankly was very scared. Shakingly I called her name, \"Sky, down.\"she listened got off my bed and hurried out of the room. I was terrified I'd never seen her like that before. I didn't think that this was my dog, there was no way she would never do that to me. I shut my door and sat on my bed a few moments later I heard her growling at me through the door, scratching at it. But then I heard something that terrified me, shook me to my core if you will. \"Let me in, Sophie\" a low raspy voice was heard through the door. I stood up terrified and hid in my closet. The scratching at the door got louder and harder until I heard a loud thud, thud thud thud. I heard the door fall onto the floor, and footsteps over it. The footsteps got closer to my closet and then I heard the voice again, \"I know you're in there, Sophie\" my heart dropped I tried not to make a noise, after a few minutes I heard a growl then the footsteps faded away as if sky had left the room. That was the last I saw of her, I hope she doesn't come back today. I don't think we'll ever get another dog",

        "text": "So this is a story about an experience I had during 2020. It was the year of the pandemic, so I was watching a lot of horror films to pass the time. \n\nFor some context, I was living with my family at the time, and I had the smallest room in the house. My room was a perfect square, and I had a queen sized bed in the middle with two doors on each corner of the room. The left door led to the main hallway, and the right door led to the garage. Creepy, right? Opening that door led to a big black void of darkness, but strangely enough… it was the door to the hallway that always made me feel strange. Well, not necessarily the door itself, but.. that corner of the room. \n\nOn a summer night, I decided to watch a movie called “Antrum”. It was gaining a lot of traction on Tik Tok and the whole selling point was that you would be cursed or die after watching it. The film is supposedly drenched in satanic ritualism. Me, curious about all the buzz ,watched it, even though my mother, who is a devout Christian, told me not to. \n\nThe film was fine. \n\nThe night I watched it, nothing happened. The morning after though I felt abnormally tired, and incredibly heavy. It felt like my energy was being leeched off of me. I didn’t think too much of it though. I plopped into bed at a very early 8am and collapsed into sleep. \n\nI woke up at my door around 1am, with my hand already on the knob. \n\nNow keep in mind,  I never slept walked in my life, but I truly don’t remember walking to my door. \n\nFor a brief moment I was confused, and then it hit me. There was something behind me. I couldn’t move, and I felt the purest form of dread I have ever felt. \n\n“Move.” I told myself. “Fucking move.”\n\nI couldn’t. It felt like I was stuck there forever. I couldn’t turn around, but what I felt behind me felt…. huge. Like it was hunching over me. It felt evil. \n\nI finally, out of nowhere, had the will to fling my door open and stumble out into the hallway. I sat in the darkness, with my door open, trying to catch my breath. \n\nI decided to walk down the hallway to get a drink of water only to be greeted by a face in the darkness, illuminated by a glow coming from underneath them. \n\nI fell to the floor in terror, and then realised it was just my mother on her iPad, sitting on our living room couch. \n\n“JESUS!” I exclaimed. \n\nShe chuckled, “What? What did I do?”\n\n“What are you doing out here this late?! You’re never up this late!”\n\nShe shrugged, “I don’t know. I couldn’t sleep so I decided to come out here and read my Bible on my iPad.”\n\n“Well you scared the hell out of me.”\n\nI was physically shaking, still trying to process the events that happened in my room moments ago. \n\n“Are you ok?” my mom asked. \n\n“Yeah, I’m fine. Just had a bad dream.” \n\nI didn’t want to explain to her what happened, and then get met with a lecture about how I need Jesus or some bullshit like that, considering that despite being raised Christian, overtime I came to the conclusion that that religion just wasn’t for me. \n\nI walked back into my room, and was immediately met with that same unwelcome energy. I couldn’t take another step forward. Defeated, I go back to my mom and confess what I was going through. \n\n“Ok, so… do you want to hear something that would either comfort you or freak you out even more?” she asked. \n\n“Sure.” I replied. It’s not like things could get any creepier. \n\n“I was very restless tonight. So like I said, I came out here to read my Bible. I came across the passage where Jesus stumbles upon a demon possessed man. The demon’s name was Legion, as there were one of many inside him. Jesus then exorcises the man and commands Legion to instead possess a heard of pigs by the cliff side. They obey, and then run the pigs off the cliff and kill them.”\n\nThere was a brief pause. I definitely remembered this passage. \n\n“After I finished reading that passage, I was overcome with a sense of urgency to pray for protection over… you.”\n\nAnother brief pause. \n\n“And I kid you not, the *moment* I started praying for you, is the moment I heard you fling open the door and stumble out into the hallway.”\n\nChills ran down my spine. \n\nEmbarrassingly enough, I slept on the couch that night. The next day, I deep cleaned my room as a symbol of cleansing any unwanted energy or visitors. Nothing really happened after that that. \n\nNow don’t get it twisted, this isn’t a story that’s rooted in Christian propaganda. I left the faith years ago, and despite this experience, I still have not returned. \n\nI still don’t really know what to make of that night though, as I don’t think it was sleep paralysis or anything along the lines of that, because I know for a FACT that both my mind and body were awake. I just… try not to question that night and just move forward. \n\nI will say this though: I am grateful for my mom that night, and her projection of good energy and protection over me, because I wonder… what would have happened if she wasn’t awake that night?",

        "text": "I still remember that fateful night of November 25, 1987, in the small city of Kiancoln, Nepal. I was a young man at the time, living just a few blocks away from the city's main fireworks store. Fireworks were a big part of our culture and were often used to celebrate important events and festivals.  \n\n\nIt was a typical Wednesday evening and I was at home with my family, watching the evening news on television when we heard a loud explosion. At first, we thought it was just a thunderstorm, but as the noise grew louder and more intense, we knew something was wrong. We quickly turned off the television and ran to the window to see what was happening.  \n\n\nAs we looked outside, we saw a massive plume of smoke rising into the sky. It was coming from the direction of the fireworks store, and it was clear that something terrible had happened. My family and I immediately ran out of the house to see what was going on.  \n\n\nAs we got closer to the store, the scene became more and more horrific. The entire building was engulfed in flames, and debris was scattered everywhere. The streets were filled with injured and dying people, screaming for help. It was like something out of a nightmare.  \n\n\nThe explosion caused a chain reaction, causing several other fireworks stores in the surrounding area to catch fire as well. The entire city was in chaos, with people running in every direction, trying to escape the flames and the falling debris.  \n\n\nThe sound of the explosions was deafening, and the heat from the fires was intense. I could feel the heat on my face and the smoke made it hard to breathe. I saw people with burns all over their bodies, and others with limbs missing. It was a scene of pure horror.  \n\n\nI tried to help as many people as I could, but it was clear that the situation was beyond my control. The emergency services were overwhelmed, and it was impossible to get through to them on the phone.  \n\n\nAs I was helping a group of injured people, I suddenly felt a searing pain in my leg. I looked down to see that a piece of shrapnel from one of the fireworks had hit me. I could feel the blood pouring out of the wound, and I knew that I needed to get to a hospital as soon as possible.  \n\n\nI stumbled away from the scene, trying to find my way to the nearest hospital. But it was impossible to get there on foot, as the streets were blocked by debris and the injured. I had no choice but to try and make it to the hospital on my own.  \n\n\nIt was a long and painful journey, but I eventually made it to the hospital. I was rushed into surgery and was in a coma for several weeks. When I woke up, I was told that I had lost my left leg below the knee.  \n\n\nThe accident that night was the worst in the history of Nepal, with 136 people killed and 1824 injured. The city of Kiancoln was forever changed. The fireworks store and the surrounding area were completely destroyed, and the people who lived there were left with nothing but memories of that terrible night.  \n\n\nThe government banned fireworks in Nepal after that accident. It was a necessary step to ensure that such a disaster would never happen again. But for those of us who survived that night, the memories of the explosion and the loss of so many lives will never be forgotten.  \n\n\nIt's a reminder that no matter how much we enjoy fireworks, we should never underestimate the damage that explosives like fireworks could and can create.",

        "author": "HeyitsFan",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10q58cl/interview_with_lucas/",
        "text": "Ok, hi, hello my name is Lucas. That's not my real name, so, yeah sorry but we're not that close yet. Not close enough to give you my name any way, but I'm sure that'll change. \n\nI'm sure you're wondering why you're here, reading this poorly thrown together jumble of words but I assure you the mystery will all be revealed, eventually or maybe never. It sorta depends on how far you get, read on if you're a sucker for the unknown. \n\nAnyways, sorry, yes, on to the reason you're here. I'm looking for some help, but not in the way you normally would acquire aid. I'm not asking for money or advice or even a hug, I'm looking for people, people who can overcome difficult tasks, make hard choices and possibly be good with conversation. \n\nI need people who can break up fights or start ones when the moment calls for it, I specifically need someone who doesn't cry at funerals as well. Oh and if you're the type who loves to finish puzzles in one sitting I'm sorry but you can stop reading now, those types just never fit in here. \n\nTo get started, try to remember the last time you were happy, was it in class getting a good grade? Or perhaps a beautiful day walking next to the river? Or even a night out with friends you'd lost touch with over the years. Do you have it? Do you got it? Good, now hold that thought, keep it in your mind and now forget about it. Are you sad I took that thought away? Do you want it back? Well tough, sadly once a memory is forgotten it's taken by someone else, now it's a dream or a stroke of inspiration for another. I hope you're not sad, I'd be happy knowing my pleasant memory gave someone else joy. If you feel crossed with me, by all means stop reading, but if you can forgive me please continue. I need someone with a healthy amount of forgiveness, even if it isn't deserved.\n\nNext the questionnaire, here are some questions I'd like you to ask yourself are:\nAre you fond of colors? \nHave you slept well knowing your place in the universe? \nDoes it upset you when a bug is crushed?\nDo you wish you could undo the past?\nIf I made you toast with jam, would you be upset that I didn't ask you first which jam you proffered?\nDo you believe in ghosts? If so, why don't I?\n\nNow, if you answered yes to all these questions I'm sorry, you're not the person I'm looking for, but you're most likely a splendid human if not for the jam and toast bit. I mean, it's honestly just breakfast, if your answers seem to be yes and no then please continue reading. I need someone who can see both sides of the coin.  \n\nConsider us now acquainted, you're one step closer to knowing my name. How exciting.\n\nNext, I'm going to tell you a story. Sit and listen, I hope you'll enjoy this. Once upon a time a man and his wife moved to the countryside to start a carrot farm, the man loved to garden and his wife loved nature. It was the perfect decision they both thought, the husband would have access to the rich soil of the countryside and the wife could spend her days among the trees.  \n \nOne day during his gardening the man spotted a deer grazing on his carrots, grabbing his shovel he killed and butchered the deer for taking his lovely carrots and buried the remains in the forest nearby. The next day the wife killed her husband and buried him among the carrots, and the day after that, the deer killed the wife and buried her next to the house.\n\nHow'd that story make you feel? Do you side with the man who killed the deer? The wife who killed her husband or the deer who killed the wife? \n\nIf you chose to side with the man I believe it's time we part ways, the poor animal was just trying to eat.\n\nIf you chose to side with the wife then please stop reading as the man didn't deserve to die by the hands of his wife for trying to protect their livelihoods. Plus deer make for hearty feasts.\n\nBut if you sided with the deer you're better off not continuing, for one, deer don't come back to life to enact revenge and two, that deer took revenge on someone who tried to appease its death in their stead. How rude to kill someone who only sought to make things right, even if misguided. \n\nNow I see you're upset, but I need someone who would look at that story and call me a lunatic for concocting such an absolutely insane tale expecting to take sides. Fret not, you may continue reading but know, the side you took will be noted when I must make my decision. Unless of course you did in fact call me a crazy fool to which I say, well done, full marks.\n\nExcellent, we've reached the halfway point of the interview. I'm sorry, you seem confused. Did I not mention this was an interview, I'm sure I did, I'm positive I did. You must be forgetting a lapse in time, it's alright, it happens to us all, time is often  difficult to understand and I'm sure your brain just didn't have enough space to remember when I told you this simple instruction. \n\nNow, now, don't be crossed with me, I wasn't the one who forgot! Honestly, you expect me to just play along? Make you feel better by lying about your inability to remember small minute insignificant bits of information. I say, I'm a bit surprised you'd be so upset with me given how nice I've been. Tell ya what, why don't you leave, that's right, leave. I've no use for people who can't keep their head on straight and to be truthful I didn't think you'd pass anyways. So go on, take your pea sized brain and shove off for all I care. I'm sure I can find someone worthy and with some modicum of respect.\n\nWhat, you're still reading, honestly what do you expect to happen, an apology, answers? a fucking parade?! Sorry but you ain't getting one. Oh blast I just apologized didn't I? Well I guess you got what you wanted. Are you happy knowing you won? Are you pleased you've outsmarted me? I didn't apologize for calling your brain small, which it still is, mind you.\n\nYet you continue to read, even though I slandered your name, called you awful things and straight out lied to you. You must truly want answers then, or perhaps you're a bit insane, either way, continue if you must I will complete the interview regardless of your desire. Push forward we must.\n\nVery well, let us move on to the next section of the interview. The world is ending, the world has ended, the world is now empty. What do you fill the world with? Picture it now in your mind, are there trees? Are people happy? Is the sky still blue or perhaps a new color never before seen?\n\nHow do the buildings take shape? Did we build them? Are there buildings in this new world? Or are they still rubble from an old era? Do the birds still sing? I do have a fondness for birds and their songs. In my world the birds always sing, the trees always grow and the sun is a square, simply because circles can not be trusted. \n\nTell me what your world looks like.\nIf it had water in it I'm glad you care for thirst, water is by far my favorite liquid. Did your world have war? We know it is inevitable, but perhaps you found a way to quell the rage of the stricken and depraved. By chance was there hope in your world? But why need hope when the world is perfect? Perhaps your world wasn't perfect after all. If you dream of a perfect world, please stop reading.\n\nDo you feel like you could make a better world? No? Or yes? A simple answer to a question that holds so much weight on the mind. What is the perfect existence? Have any of us achieved it? How can we strive for perfection when we have not the ideal blueprints to work from? I say it's most complexing to be us, always looking to achieve another goal, gain a new skill, climb that ladder we call success. \n\nDo you find it easy to be a human? Do you think it's effortless to be alive, if you answered yes. Please stop reading, I need someone who knows the tribulations of humanity and lives them, carries them and accepts them. What I need is someone who knows these truths, yet still lives knowing the answers we wish we could exist without. Continue reading if you live knowing the weight of truth. \n\nGoodness, that part of the interview always gets so heavy, I feel like I need a break. Do you need a break? Gosh, remember when the questions were about colors and ghosts. What a time, what a time indeed. \n\nCan I get you something to drink? A creme soda perhaps? Those are favorites among the staff, so we always have some. A coffee might suit you better, we all need that drive to get us through the day. Or perhaps a tea, steeped and brewed to perfection?\n\nNow, I think soda is a perfectly fine choice if you want to join the social norm, but tea at this time of day might make you an outlier and be shunned. However coffee is a safe bet and well respected but could you honestly go without it if you had to? \n\nOr by chance, did you choose a fourth option, maybe even a glass of water, seeing as you knew water was my favorite liquid. Regardless of your choice you must know, even the smallest choices we make, create stories for others to weave about you. Even if you chose nothing, the absence of choice can still lead to vastly drastic conclusions. I would even suggest you stop reading if your decision was to drink nothing. Seeing as I was so kind as to offer a free beverage. \n\nPardon me while I drink my beverage, take this time to ponder if you'll continue, if you think you wish to proceed by all means enjoy your drink as well.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nRefreshing, yes? I feel better knowing we shared a moment to enjoy our drinks. I would almost call us working friends, if that's OK with you? If we are friends, please, I'd like to continue but if you see me as annoying, insufferable or not worth your time by all means, there's the door. \n\nThose who have stayed, I'm glad you're here, you honor me with your time, the small amount of time you have gifted me is something I will cherish forever until the very stars that light our sky explode and shower the void with its light. \n\nI'm getting carried away, but know, I still care about the time we share. Speaking of time, would you like some back? Are you old now? Are you young and want to be old? I can give you these things you know? I can give you all the time you want, or all the time you need. Do you need a day, a month or even a lifetime? Did you get it right the first time, or do you need more time to prove your worth? Perhaps you want more time to figure things out, or more time to get things the way you want them. I've been given so much time I often find myself wasting it on useless things, so sometimes I give my time to others. How much will you take from me? You can have it all if you wanted, I won't hold it against you, you might need it more than me? Or maybe you squandered the time you were given and now seek to merely take advantage of this opportunity. Either way, no grudge awaits you. \n\nHow much did you take? A few seconds to collect your thoughts or did you by chance take too much? I feel myself slipping, perhaps it's my time to pass on now, I don't hold it against you, you needed it more than me, I was only going to spend it listening to the birds sing. What a waste of time some would say. Would you say the same? \n\nI kept enough time to finish this interview, my job requires me to do so, I'm one of the best employees here and I plan to keep that record going. Let's wrap things up, I'd hate to upset the working conditions here with my untimely death. \n\nNow, onto the final questions. Are we friends? Have I made a good impression? I'm sorry to ask but I truly must know, a friendship cannot simply exist if only one participant wishes it so. If you read this far, I think you're my friend, at least by my standards, to listen to me speak and continue to read is a great show of friendship, it's clear really. You may think you're obligated to stay but I've given you escape and yet here you remain. A stranger who continues to listen to someone who doesn't know their real name. \n\nSo are we friends? Your answer matters most, If yes then, thank you. But you must leave because you're too easy to please and quick to trust which is what I don't need. If not then thank you, please continue to read. \n\nThe truth is you'll never know my name, none truly do, so continue to read if that's OK with you. \n\nThe job I need you for, is one unlike any other, to make the choice I can't, the one I wished to never burden on another. You see my interviewee, the job for which I have for you is one that takes respect, a modicum of grace and above all wit. Not many can perform this task and so I leave it to the chosen few who can make the choice I rarely do. You'll be the one to cut the thread of the ones we love and the ones we hate, you'll be the ones to end their fate. \n\nI'm sorry for the theatrics, but I really had to be sure, if you're the one who's willing to make life's grand detour. The hours are long, the task is grueling but the right employee will do so willingly, so I wish to continue this interview if you read up to this part. You're now on my short list so bravo for getting this far.\n\nPlease leave your resume, I'll keep your answers safe, and two or three references just in case. \n\nThank you again for lending me your time, I cherish it still. I hope you cherish mine. \n\nWe'll be in touch...",
