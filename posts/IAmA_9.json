        "text": "Yesterday, NYSNA nurses at Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospitals in NYC went on strike to demand caps on the number of patients nurses can be assigned at once. At my hospital in the Bronx, we serve a large, impoverished, mostly minority community in the unhealthiest borough in NYC. Our Emergency Department is always overcrowded (so much so that we now admit patients to be cared for in our hallways), and with severe post-COVID nursing shortages, our nurses are regularly asked to care for up to 20 patients at once. NYSNA nurses at many other NYC hospitals recently came to agreements with their hospitals, and while Montefiore and Mt. Sinai nurses have already secured the same 19% raise (over 3 years) as their colleagues at other hospitals, they decided to proceed with their strike over these staffing ratios and patient safety.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/nyregion/nurses-strike-hospitals-nyc.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/nyregion/nurses-strike-hospitals-nyc.html)\n\nHospital administration has blasted out email after email accusing nurses of abandoning their patients and pointing to the already agreed upon salary increase accepted at other hospitals without engaging with the serious and legitimate concerns nurses have over safe staffing. In the mean time, hospital admin is offering eye-popping hourly rates to traveling nurses to help fill the gap. Elective surgeries are on hold, outpatient appointments have been cancelled to reallocate staff, and ambulances are being redirected to neighboring hospitals. One of our sister residency programs at Wakefield Hospital that is not directly affected by the strike has deployed residents to a new inpatient team to accommodate the influx in patient. At our hospitals, attending physicians have been recruited (without additional pay) to each inpatient team to assist in nursing tasks - transporting/repositioning patients, feeding and cleaning, taking blood pressures, administering medications, etc.\n\nThis is all happening while resident physicians at Montefiore approach a hard-fought vote over whether or not to unionize and join the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR) - a national union for physicians in training. Residents are physicians who have completed medical school but are working for 3-7 years in different specialties under the supervision of attending physicians. We regularly work 80hr weeks or more at an hourly rate of $15 (my paycheck rate, not accounting for undocumented time we work) with not-infrequent 28hr shifts. We have little ability to negotiate for our benefits, pay, or working conditions and essentially commit to an employment contract before we even know where in the country we will do our training (due to the residency Match system). We have been organizing in earnest for the last year and half (and much longer than that) to garner support for resident unionization and achieved the threshold necessary to go public with our effort and force a National Labor Relations Board election over the issue. Montefiore chose not to voluntarily recognize our union despite the supermajority of trainees who signed on, and have hired a union-busting law firm which has been pumping out anti-union propaganda. We will be voting by mail in the first 2 weeks of February to determine whether we can form our union.\n\n[https://gothamist.com/news/more-than-1000-doctors-in-training-at-bronx-hospital-announce-unionization](https://gothamist.com/news/more-than-1000-doctors-in-training-at-bronx-hospital-announce-unionization)\n\n[https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/montefiore-hospital-union-cir/](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/montefiore-hospital-union-cir/)\n\nHoping to answer what questions I can about the nursing strike, residency unionization, and anything else you might be wondering about NYC hospitals in this really exciting moment for organized labor in NY healthcare.

We have spent more than six months looking into the presence of heavy metals in baby food for Bloomberg Law. \n \nWe sent 33 baby food products purchased from Amazon and groceries in the Washington, DC area to an accredited lab and found that all but one had significant levels of at least two of three heavy metals: lead, arsenic, and cadmium. Heavy metals are known to lower IQ, slow development, and create other serious health issues. \n \nThe Food and Drug Administration has known about the dangers of substances like lead and arsenic for decades. So have Congress and manufacturers.  Yet the FDA, which has come under fire for a wide range of failures in regulating food safety, has set few enforceable limits for heavy metals baby foods and its timeline for doing so stretches out for years.\n \n[You can read the interactive story here](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/baby-foods-with-toxic-metals-stay-on-us-market-while-fda-dithers).

I started at Bolton where I spent over 7 years in the academy and made by debut in 2015, at Bury on loan from Bolton. Then I spent a full season before joining Arsenal for 3 million.\n\nThrough the high and the lows I've enjoyed my time at Arsenal and hope to remain for several years. I  always enjoy playing for Arsenal and love playing with great teammates and under a world-class manager. \n\nI'll be answering questions from 8PM to 9PM Eastern time or 4PM-5PM North American time.\n\nAMA\n\nPROOF: https://imgur.com/a/0si96NN",

        "text": " \n\nBrace yourselves this is going to send hella cringe and simpy. But i graduated hs two years and i still cannot move on from the love of my life. I fell in love with this girl named Carly since my sophomore year, We started off as friends, she knew I always liked her and used to always give me attention back and flirt with me. She was a goddess. Her eyes, her hair, her smile, her face, her nose, her seductive voice, everything, including her personality, she was so kind-hearted and cared about everyone. Although later on, I felt like she really was leading on me which she most likely was and it honestly made me upset, I started trash-talking her and I guess that's where I fumbled and made her hate me. She continued to led on me for a while until eventually my senior year she just completely cut me off, also she always used to hang out with other dudes (she never liked them in that way tho) and left me out which always made me feel worse. she would always tell me she wanted to hang and i would tell her stop joking and stuff but she said she wasn't and really wanted to, i think at one point she expected me to ask her to go to homecoming but i never did which i incredibly regret. It has now been two years since i graduated high school and have talked to her, (lost all contact with her since she later blocked me on everything) I have met and interacted with many girls in college and made many friends, but none of them were able to pull me away from her. There is not a single day i do not think about Carly and what we could've been. Many of her friends tell me she never liked me from the start, but i feel that they're just saying that so i can get over it which i never will. I still love her to this day, i look at her vsco multiple times per day, and i honestly cannot even vision myself being with or even marrying anyone else besides her. I do a lot of things to distract me and get my mind off her tho like hitting the gym (helps the most), video games, basketball, anime, but that doesn't play a factor, I will never let this girl go...\n\nProof: here is me [https://www.tiktok.com/@kamklout999/video/7128924613240818987?is\\_copy\\_url=1&amp;is\\_from\\_webapp=v1](https://www.tiktok.com/@kamklout999/video/7128924613240818987?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1) \n\nand Here is Carly (one on the left): [https://vsco.co/carlyzeiler/media/62ba4a7b0cf06c347d019e90](https://vsco.co/carlyzeiler/media/62ba4a7b0cf06c347d019e90)",
