Had a great year finally learning to live again. She left me flowers at my doorstep when I graduated from high school in this most recent June, and that was the last I heard from her...\n\n...until now! She hasn't texted since the cat died, and now she's texted me twice in a day as if life was normal again. I'm sickened and frustrated. I can't block her number because, as we have the same provider, she'll get a notification that I blocked her if she tries to text again, and I'm not about to go through that. I'm really scared she's getting more insistent on getting me back in her life, especially since I'm about to head into a difficult program in college and the last thing I want on my mind is if she showed up, which is something she's threatened to do when I moved in with my dad or when she knows I'm at school after class hours.\n\nAny advice?\n\nUpdate: she texted yet again with an update about my favorite cousin, who I had to break contact with. I miss him very much... :'(",

I am now NC with her for 5 months, but of course this is only the beginning of the journey.\n\nI wanted to point out one thing that I find I have trouble with.\n\nI am unable to focus on, protect, and nurture my own life - and quickly focused on others.  For example if my husband needs something to me, I find myself making that a priority second to that of someone I hardly am close to.  General example I know.  But my point is this.  My NMom never taught me self reliance, and self trust.  She always made it that there was something else to look to outside of your own self, there was always better out \"there.\" And thus, perhaps my inability to enjoy what I have in my own life, is this outward focus.  I will say I have a wonderful husband, and great life.  Just not able to focus and appreciate it. \n\nI will elaborate more once I have the chance, but do you any of you feel similar? ",

And, unlike the main overt Narc, the enabler (despite being vunerable in appearance) is not as vunerable when it comes down to it. They become cruelty personified, over time, it seems to me. And it's a cruelty dealt in warped twisted ways, it seems to appear. \n\nWhat is your experience with enablers vs main narcs? Which do you consider least tolerable?

        "text": "I've had two back to back N relationships spanning four years. While I was with N #1, I became very close friends with a woman I met through a support forum, similar to this one, for loved ones of Ns and other Cluster B types. She became my life raft, and the only person I could talk to who really understood what I was going through. Regular friends just did not get it.\n\nOver the next three years, I became emotionally dependent on my friend, who was always a reliable person to run to whenever a bomb went off with any of the Ns in my life (I also have N family members). She began calling me every morning on her way to work, and I looked forward to these calls. They were like therapy sessions where I could unload my problems, and my friend strongly encouraged this dynamic.\n\nI'm now 2 months out of my relationship with my second N boyfriend, and as I'm moving further away from all the chaos that having a N partner brings, I'm starting to realize that I don't like the person I am in my friendship with this woman. I've begun to see that, in our particular dynamic, I experience myself as a huge complaining whining victim. And I think she gravitates to people who have a victim mentality, bc by playing therapist with them, she gets to experience *herself* as a savior. Like a Mother Theresa, ministering to her brood of wounded souls.\n\nI began to realize about my friend that she also has a victim mentality, but seems very stuck in her ways and unlikely to ever change. For example, she still speaks bitterly about a job she lost, due to a backstabbing dishonest boss, and she says that this derailed her career and she's never recovered. This happened like 12 years ago! The truth is that she turned down other opportunities, after she was let go from that job, bc she didn't want to work too far away from her N ex. She sabotaged her own career, but she won't take any personal responsibility for that, and still sees herself as a huge victim. Ever after all these years, she still has no insight.\n\nHer ex husband, who she divorced a decade ago, is the biggest victim of all, and she plays the role of savior, paying some of his bills to this day, rushing to his rescue whenever he has an issue, be it health problems, relationship problems, car problems, anything.\n\nI've had the painful realization that my friend likely gravitated to me bc I was someone she could similarly play therapist and savior with. My life has been so full of drama and pain and suffering the past four years, thanks to the N boyfriends, that I've had no shortage of that to bring to her. It's only as things are starting to calm down that I'm starting to see this pattern with her.\n\nI don't like who I am in the friendship anymore. Instead of looking forward to her daily morning calls, I now realize that I feel drained by them. I hang up with a negative, dark cloud mindset, as my friend expects me to open up and discuss all my innermost pain and issues, but I'm not always in the mood for a therapy session first thing in the morning. I've realized that, if you have something really bothering you and weighing on you, it can be helpful to talk it out with someone. But if you don't, then forcing yourself to generate heavy, emotional, personal talk is draining and depressing.\n\nI have a real life support group that I go to for loved ones of Ns. It's been enormously helpful to me. The vibe there is incredibly positive and inspiring and supportive and empowered. When I leave the meetings I feel *uplifted*. When I hang up from talking to my friend, on the other hand, about the exact same subject, I feel negative and drained and irritable.\n\nI think this is bc, in my interactions with my friend, I become a huge victim, full of negativity, and with my support group, I experience myself in a completely different, positive way.\n\nI've had the life changing understanding that I now have to move on from a victim mentality and to stop defining myself this way. Yes, I have been victimized by Ns throughout my life, but I don't want this to hold me back anymore. I want to take responsibility and stop feeding my addiction to that victim mindset. Unfortunately, I don't believe that switching gears to a more positive dynamic is possible with my friend, as I have begun to see her as a career victim, and someone who is likely permanently stuck. She doesn't seem interested in doing the work to grow and move on. She will become very defensive and have a lot of excuses if you ever dare suggest change.\n\nHave you developed a victim mentality thanks to N abuse? Have you outgrown friendships that you realized were largely negative?",

My narc bro has been trying to hoover me for the past few weeks by promises of “food, mac computer, concert show tickets” for all of which I replied with the same “No, thanks. I have work”. \nThe last time I allowed these narcs to abuse me was in October of last year when my narc bro devalued me and abused me in his car because I was stupid enough to not see what he was doing and was brainwashed by my covert narc mother that “we have a wonderful family” . pssh..\n\n\nI don’t know why I am so slow to understand these things. I mean I am 36 for crying out loud! I should know that these are dangerous people. Talking about danger, let me go back to the altercation I had with my narc bro today.\n\n\nSo I took a shower today and sometimes when I shower I accidently spill some water on the bathroom floor . My narc bro usually raises his terrorist voice every time it’s time for him to take his royal shower ( not directly ) , but with my mother.  But the way he does is very terrifying because he’s the same guy who tried to come at me with a knife about 3 years ago when I first moved in into this apartment. Even though  he tried to terrorize me , I let him know in a strong manner that it’s not happening and that I won’t be terrorized anymore by him.\n\n\nI got about 1.3k saved up in my bank. If I look hard enough, I can find a room for $500. I make around $1,000 a month . If I work hard enough, I can bring it up to $1,500 per month. \nWould you recommend me to leave this hell hole right now right this moment or should I wait? I ask this question because I am trying to raise my wealth , but it’s not easy for me to do considering my PTSD symptoms. I am worried that if I move with that amount of cash, $300 after $500 rent and $500 security deposit, I won’t have anything to cling on to if something goes wrong. Moreover I have to pay $100 for car registration this month because my registration is expiring.\n\n\n\nHow much money do you think someone in my situation should save up before moving out?\n",

And eventually I wasn't intimidated by him because it gave me enough time to gain enough clarity to realize that something wasn't quite right. I couldn't put my finger on it at that time but my gut was telling me that something's wrong. \n\nAnyways, one day in class the narc and I started talking. It was small talk but when the conversation ended he began to perform one of his evil stares but this time I wasn't afraid anymore. I was unchained from his control. When he was maliciously staring into my soul I separated myself from the situation while starring back. Our eyes were locked for several seconds until he began to nervously tap on his desk. I shifted my gaze towards the tapping and the interaction ended at that point.\n\nHe was probably expecting some sort of fear to surface within me but I mirrored it. After this interaction I continued to stay away from this person. He tried hoovering me a few times but he failed to catch me in his web. \n\nLiberation. :) \n",

While NMom has hurt me deeply, I don't want to do something that would be seen as nasty, these women are both equally important to me and have been there for me in ways NMom just isn't capable of. I'm just feeling torn between truly wanting to honor the women who are there for me but not wanting it to come off as something I'm doing out of spite or resentment.",

        "text": "Have come to realise over the past few years (largely thanks to Reddit) that my mother shows more than a few N traits. I moved out of my parents' house when I was 18, am almost double that age now but recently have been struggling, badly, with the realisation of everything that's 'happened to me'. I mean, I knew when it was happening, very deep down, that it wasn't right - the narrative of me being an 'ungrateful child/typical teenager' was BS (I have never smoked/taken any drugs, didn't drink until recently, didn't have a BF until I was 18, straight-edge, boring AF, straight-A student, etc) but everyone - every single person in my life - believed it, thought I must be \"up to something\". I now find myself in a high-pressure job with severe imposter syndrome, a few abusive/dysfunctional relationships under my belt, classic people-pleaser (that many perceive as weakness) mode engaged, but have been getting by OK for the most part. Life was much easier after I moved away and went naturally LC, but recently I've had to return home a lot. Both of my parents now have dementia, so they aren't really the same people any more (thankfully, in my mother's case). We now have kind of a BoJack Horseman situation going on, where she'll have these sudden moments of lucidity that she'll use to tell me I look like shit (\"Couldn't you have done something with your hair?\") after I've taken a half-day from work to bring her to a hospital appointment, or that I'd \"better get moving\" if I want kids. (How could I possibly even entertain the idea of having children when I have no idea what a parent should be?). \n\nThe worst part of it all is that I can't really talk to anyone about this. I have siblings but it's like I am the only one who perceives our childhood in this way (though they have plenty of issues between them). I have some really good friends who were there for a lot of my teens, and still are, but they never really understood (through no fault of their own - they were just judging my parents based on their own - normal - parents' standards). When I was upset, they'd try to comfort me, once even asked me if my parents hit me or sexually abused me (which just made me feel even worse, because NO, of course they hadn't, so why was I so very upset? Other kids have it much worse! I \\*must\\* just be a drama queen/looking for attention, etc, etc). How could I possibly explain about the \\*constant\\* criticism, the guilt-trips when I'd ask for something as a child (\"You KNOW we can't afford that!\"), even something I needed like clothes? How I was the golden child in public/behind my back (I was the stick used to beat the others \"Your grades aren't as good as your sister's!\"), but I could never do anything right at home. How I genuinely thought I'd never get in to college (her dream for me, she said), and when I did and came home all excited to tell her, I was \"acting like you're too good for the family, now you're in college\". There was a lot of \"But she's your MOTHER, she loves you, you'll get past this\" going on from friends, which only compounded my guilt, and feelings that I was a worthless, no-good daughter. When I tried to tell my friends about finding r/raisedbynarcissists, one friend remarked \"Oh, is that the sub where everyone goes to blame their parents for all their flaws?\". \n\nSo my question is - how do you guys cope? My major issue is guilt - I \\*do\\* actually feel like I'm blaming my parents for everything, instead of just growing as a person/overcoming adversity and being resilient. And it's not helpful. So how do I help myself? I'm plagued by self-doubt and constant anxiety, and yet I \\*know\\* I've had the strength to do things in the past that other people could never do. I walked away from my entire family aged 18 and started a new life, alone, supported myself through 2 degrees working part time along the way. I've had my work published and won awards. So why do I feel so small, useless and unworthy? Any advice would be good, particularly with building resilience. Thanks in advance, I'm glad that you're here (even though I wish none of us were).",

        "text": "I have a horribly convoluted situation that is headed toward NC, and I'm still surprised by how this is playing out, so I'm not sure how to prepare myself for what is next.\n\nLate last year Nmom got me a job at her workplace, and I was living with her. This allowed me to save money for college and catch rides with her (I have no car). Last month, her husband kicked me out of the house with zero days notice. Nmom said she'd pay for me to rent a room somewhere, but that did not happen. My mom has a history of stealing/identity theft, and I asked her if she ever stole money off my student loans. She exploded and ended our relationship. Then texted me two weeks later, raging over something unrelated. \n\nAt work, Nmom has told people we are not speaking. She will not look at me, she is having my boss deliver my personal mail, and I am spending $20/day commuting to and from work. Next weekend I need to go to her home and get my belongings. I am moving out of the country in September and this is my one and final opportunity to get whatever is there.\n\n- I have no idea what to expect when I go to collect my things. Given that I moved out in a matter of hours, the room is a mess and I am worried about how I will do this. My coworker offered to come with me, but I know that will enrage Nmom.\n\n- I do not know what kind of legal documents I need to retrieve. At this point, I do not even know what company I am sending my student loan payments to. Nmom loves this.\n\n- I am quitting my job and having surgery on the 21st of this month. I am leaving the country Sept 5. I have no idea if Nmom is going to freak out again when those dates pop up.\n\nNmom has put me under severe financial stress during one of the largest and most expensive moves of my life. I am a student and prior to all this, she was using money as a control tactic when we argued. I am unsure if I should even file a police report against her for identity theft-- I am exhausted, I am moving away, and the debt has been repaid. If I file the report, she goes to jail and I lose my only living family member.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. I can't even believe this is happening and I don't know what to expect from her next. This is the longest \"power move\" I have ever seen her carry out and I am waiting for her to swing the other way into hysterics. I am almost afraid that she won't and I will be dealing with this until the day I move away. I've spent the entirety of my twenties struggling and I am just trying to get away with as little trouble as possible.\n",

        "text": "I feel strange typing this out to you. In part because it’s something I normally wouldn’t talk about, but also because I feel a bit ashamed of it. So here it goes. \n\nI’ve gone NC a while ago and have been going to therapy since. It’s been tough; I realized things were way more toxic than I thought. Some memories were incomplete and I found back the pieces. And some had been completely been pushed down and came back up; it made me realize that my dad had been way more interested in his own daughter than he should’ve been. It’s been life changing to say the least. \nIt’s like I am more drawn to throwing my life away than ever. Sometimes I sit around and think about quitting my job and just drinking, or deciding that I’ve had enough with life and acting on it.  It all feels like a huge relief, and life gets back to being hard when I step out of the daydreaming. \nSo I can honestly say I’ve not been at a great place; with all these changes I feel like I don’t really know who I am anymore, but I also feel high strung and uncomfortable most of the time. I have flashbacks, nightmares and sometimes something specific can trigger me into feeling panicked (such as being tickled or being hugged in the dark). \n\nI’ve got a great partner. He’s kind, supportive, understanding, just wonderful. But I can tell that I am different since I went in for therapy, specifically since my last big memory recall of my dad. I don’t like to be touched, such as hugs or kisses. I feel uncomfortable talking about my feelings to anyone and I get really annoyed easily. When someone (I care about) gets close, I feel like running. So for now, the more intimate part of our relationship has been put on hold until I feel safe again. Again, he’s perfectly supportive. \nBut I find that, even though I am too scared to get close, the idea of a stranger or someone who I already know would be a terrible decision looks more appealing. \nIt’s been a handful of people I’ve thought of in terms of being attractive, and a friend who I’ve found attractive and have thought about in more than a friendly way. \nIt makes me feel horrified. I would never, ever, do anything (cheating or otherwise) but the thought alone makes me feel so ashamed towards my partner. Even it just being in my head and nothing more, it feels like he deserves better. And this is not like me; I don’t think about others that way (though i know I’d feel bad if I did). And I didn’t when we both agreed that waiting to get intimate for a while would be best for me (it still is), but I do now that it’s been a few weeks. Maybe it’s the physical response that comes with the abstinence, while I can logically acknowledge that I am not ready. I don’t know. \n\nMy therapist has told me that I’ve always been attracted to abusive people because that was all I knew, it was normal to me. Nice people scared me off, because it was abnormal behavior. She said it takes time to make the abnormal normal again. I find that it’s easier when life is good to accept kind behavior. But somehow when life is hard, I seem to feel more inclined to go back to what I know. I don’t mean to but I think that’s where it comes from, combined with realizing what my parents (specially dad) did to me which makes me feel panic when someone tries to get closer. \n\nSo my question is: am I the only one who has felt/thought this? And am I a horrible person for this? ",

        "text": "Background; dad diagnosed malignant narc, NC 6 years. He's never met my husband or children, that will never change. My mom isn't your normal brand of N. She's covert N, but co-morbid with BPD. I know this, but I still had a glimmer of hope.\n\nMy mom isn't as bad as most. Most times I genuinely enjoyed her company and looked forward to hearing her take on situations. She's a good citizen, doesn't break laws and kind of has an obsession with being morally right. Annoying, but ultimately not bad for society, right? But of course, any time I actually needed someone (anyone! for major life events, medical emergencies, anything I needed support for) she was a fucking nightmare. You know the story. I was on a 6 month 'trial' NC by suggestion of my therapist so I could heal and focus on a cross country move with my two young children. The end of 6 months is next week, and I'd crafted a letter outlining everything. I edited it countless times, taking out my own emotion, listing facts. I had 6 different people proof read and give input. My therapist weighed in on the letter heavily. It was all of her behavior that I need to protect my children from. Her escalation during arguments (mentally, physically). Her inability to read or care about the other person during arguments (pushing her children too far while they were minors). I laid bare how her authoritarian parenting style made me feel, and all the long term affects it had on my brother and I. I used past and present examples for her manipulation, minimization, deflection, denial, blame, dismissal, rationalization of her actions, justification, self pity, martyrdom and victimization. Her non-apologies and rugsweeping. I clearly laid out how the past affects the present, and how all the unresolved conflict has given me indescribably pain. I ended with saying I'd leave a designated email open for her therapist's contact information.\n\nAnd she responded by saying one of my examples didn't happen. It was when one of our arguments escalated until she hit me and I called the police, and then she lied to them on their arrival saying she never hit me. She's maintaining she didn't lie to the police. I didn't even read the rest, I don't care. I'm not going to respond.\n\nThe entire day I've been spiraling. I want to take every piece of art I've ever made and burn or smash it to the ground. Just the thought of doing that makes me more calm. I can't describe this feeling of need for destruction. I've been fantasizing about running away from everything in my life, destroying everything I've built. Abandoning my business, my home, my family. I just drove on the freeway for over an hour today listening to manifest destiny by Guster. \n\nI'm christian. Everyone in my life is family oriented. I'm asked about it constantly. I'm now NC with both my parents, and my relationship with GCbro hangs by a thread.\n\nI haven't talked to my therapist yet, and I'm not going to actually destroy anything but I can't stop thinking about it. If you've been in my shoes, what did you do? How did you get through it?",

        "text": "Tldr; FIL is N, became more apparent after his wife's death, so 6 months ago we left almost everything to get away. \n\nIve never posted before because in some ways it isn't my story to tell. Also because I haven't been in a mental place to share.  I frequent RBN but don't interact since he isn't my father.  \n\nIt really became obvious a few years after his wife died. He had heart surgery.  During the process of getting trusts and wills set up,  and lots of questionable conversations with friends and family during his recovery,  my husband and I were convinced that he was showing signs of dementia. He was finally home long enough and talking to so many people that his stories weren't adding up. My hubby and I started comparing notes. My hubby wanted so badly for it to be true. \n\nDementia would be so much easier to accept than having an N parent who is constantly and discreetly manipulating, scapegoating. It even explained how my FIL could \"accidentally\" try to run my hubby over. But it couldn't explain how this had been going on for my hubby's whole life. \n\nSo once we realized that we were intentially being manipulated and treated like slaves, we knew we had to leave the family farm.  My hubby had been working on the farm his entire 40 years. Even when he went to college... even when he moved away and got a full time job. Anytime they needed help, he was their go- to. Then his mom got sick with cancer 12 years ago, he moved back to help the family.  She went into remission eventually but he couldn't leave. He had to help on the farm. He wasn't allowed to have his own career or move because it was his duty to help farm. Drop everything in a seconds notice whether it was planting, harvest, cows got out, equipment broke down, or n-dad wanted to go on another vacation.  \n\nI moved to the farm with my daughter 8 years ago. I loved his family. They seemed... whole. But there was always what appeared to be communication problems. But when his mom got sick with brain cancer 4 years ago,  the family fell apart. My SIL1 went NC with the entire family immediately after MIL's death. SIL2 was in and out but had her own issues.  We got married 2 weeks after MIL's funeral because my hubby didn't want to reschedule.  N-dad was \"too wrought with grief\" to stay home and was ready to retire, so he traveled nonstop. \n\nMy hubby swallowed his grief and stepped up. But we could never get n-dad to sign a contract. Should have been a sign.  He set up a contract with SIL2 and her SO to take over crops behind our back. She hasn't even been in the picture for over a decade.   N-dad was originally going to give us enough crop lands to support the cattle, but SIL2 got it instead. We got cattle but no way to feed them.  Old cattle that had less than 50% fertility rates. But it's family, we did what we had to do.  The pastures had been neglected for years, the corrals literally collapsing. We put so much time and money into making the cattle business safe and functional again. And Meanwhile I  took care of n-dads  father, \"grampa\", who actually owned the farm but obviously had no say anymore. \n\nAnd this whole time, the trailer we lived in was literally rotting around us. We had no money to fix it. We started demanding to know what was going to happen when grandpa died. We needed to know what we were investing our blood and sweat in.  Turns out the whole farm would be split between all 5 of grampa's kids, even though only n-dad has been around to run it for the past 50+ years. That wouldn't leave us with enough to run the poor herd we had.  Then we demanded to know how n-dad had his trust set up. \n\nHe was also splitting everything between his 4 kids. So even though my hubby had put his entire life into this farm, and no one else had even been around,  he would end up getting a quarter of his dad's 5th. \n\nWith everything else going on (soooooo much gaslighting) we decided to cut our losses. 6 months ago we took our last cattle check and found a cheap home to put a down payment on. I still drive back every day to take care of grampa, he's now 104, but we left the farm:  home and business.  SIL2 took the opportunity to take over the cattle. \n\nThen n-dad and SIL2 started giving us the silent treatment. N-dad convinced SIL2 that we're the toxic ones. Defending ourselves just made it seem true so we stopped. That makes NC relatively easy I guess.  But it's a day to day process that hurts a lot. And there has been lots of bumps. The future is scary but at least we're taking it into our own hands. ",

My therapist before going NC was alright but she was in training, knew my NParents (like saw them at church every week), and we just out grew each other. She helped a lot with validation and being allowed to feel and talk about emotions and issues. \n\nAfter going NC I sought a therapist in my new town. I reached out to a few specialists and either never heard back or they were booked. I found one who said she specialized in abuse on Psychology Today. I went in for a consultation meeting and while giving her the over view and telling her some experiences, she started crying, saying, “how awful,” “you poor thing,” etc. I told her I felt stuck, that I wanted to work on healing and I was looking for guidance towards that. She told me I was doing everything right and just keep doing what I’m doing. While I appreciate the encouragement, it was not the experience I needed. It may just be that her methods don’t work for me. I don’t want to feel like I have to console my therapist. In the session, I found myself dumbing down or editing. Needless to say, I didn’t go back to her. \n\nLong story short, I want to look again. The resources in this community have been amazing and have helped me through so much. However, I find myself circle and falling into the same patterns. I’ll do well for a few weeks or a month and then back to old habits. I’m draining myself and my positive support system. \n\nI did a quick google search and found [Harley Therapy](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/online-counselling-psychologists.htm) which is a UK based Skype counseling. I was wondering if anyone has heard of this group or others or have tried and what their experiences are?",

Left home in NY and moved to TX. But the hoovering was strong. I didn’t even know what that meant until recently.  But when I left, my mother would constantly call me and every single phone call she did , made me feel like crap afterwards. \n\n\nFast forward to 2014, I was out of the country and all of a sudden I hear news that my narc father is on death bed. I know it’s cruel to say, but I think my narc brother had something to do with it even though the “narrative” goes that he was the good son who took care of ‘dad’ during his sick days. Smh.\n\n\nThe guy tried to kill me in 2008 which is when I left and there was a police case against him. \nAnyway, in the past few years since I moved back in , I have learned a lot more about Narcissism mainly from this sub reddit and other materials have come to the realization that No Contact starting with VLC is the only way to go. I would do the NC right away if I had the kahunas, but I don’t know if I do. \nHere’s why I say that – Even this past weekend, my narc bro and narc mom went to a wedding out of state and I felt nauseous when they left and relapsed from my addidction. The addiction to the narcissist is real and I fear that this will mess me up real bad when I move out. \n\nI fear that if I move out, loneliness will take over and I will fall into a huge addiction trap and mess up my life forever. I do understand that the “loneliness” is the withdrawal I have to go through to overcome my addiction to narcs, but I don’t know if I have the courage to do it. \nMy mother is a covert narc who supported everyone who abused me. My father was a malignant narcissist who hated me since the day I was born. My brother is my born enemy whose every waking breath is to attack me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. \n\nI want out desperately, but I am afraid I will lose my ability to earn income If I fall into addiction as a result of withdrawal from narcissists when I move out. Has anyone else gone through withdrawal from narcissists? How did you deal with it? \n\nI know Ross Rosenberg says that this is a 3 month withdrawal period usually. I am 36 right now, so it might be a little more than that for me.\n",

        "text": "Husband was always verbally abusive. He once choked me until I passed out. It ramped up again in June and I filed for divorce. He slammed a door in my face and I attempted to open the door (it barely budged; not my proudest moment) and he lied to a judge and said I hit him with a door and threatened him with homelessness and got a temporary restraining order against me. It didn't force me to leave the house and we have a child who I was not about to leave him alone with, so I stayed. He spent those 3 weeks harassing me, telling me to kill myself, that I'm garbage, etc. Our kid was asking if she is garbage. I never respond or anything. I just let him speak and sang to my kid so she didn't have to hear it. I was under a court order to not harass him. I just let him talk. He didn't show to the court date and it was vacated.\n\nA week ago he said if he was the guy I say he is he should have killed me years ago. He says I deserve to die. He says I'm filth and that he hopes I end up with someone who abuses me. He makes a choking gesture. I call my lawyer and ask if I can leave with the kid and car and I pack what I can carry when he is not looking and leave. We got a no contact restraining order against him and he had to leave the house and cannot contact me at all. However he can visit with our kid. All messages have to go through his mom or brother. \n\nHe does not work and says his fibromyalgia is too bad to work. I disagree. I offered to pay 1 year's rent and I left him with $9k in cash. I could afford both. I've reached out 3 times about setting up visitation and both his mother and brother say he is not interested at this time. \n\nI feel incredibly responsible for doing this to him, even though he has enough to stay in an AirBnB for a month until he gets a place, and we only kicked him out 5 days before his court ordered move out date. I think he is living with his mom in her studio. They mostly hate each other. His mom is ok but a hot mess herself. I was truly scared for my life. I had been sleeping next to a knife for days. My kid has not mentioned him once. When she saw him yesterday with the police to remove his things, she cried asking for the police to come back, not for her dad. \n\nI'm sure he is filing some court order against me as we speak. I want him to have once 12 hour day with our kid per week and one evening per week, or one 24 hour period per week if he has a safe place for her to be. The judge told me to not restrict his parenting time at all. Moving forward, how does anyone parallel parent with someone like this? How do you trust them not to manipulate your kid? \n\nAnd beyond that, how will I know when I am ready to start looking for someone again? I want to remarry for my kid's sake. I cannot physically have more children (I have a planned hysterectomy next year). How did you know when you were ready? ",

        "text": "I have a close, inner circle friend of almost 3 years who found me on an online forum similar to this one, for loved ones of Ns and other Cluster B types. She lives about a 4 hour drive from me.\n\nWe started talking on the phone every day, and have visited each other several times over the 3 years we've been in touch. When we met, I was deep into my abusive relationship with N #1, who was evil incarnate. I was very isolated at that time in my life, and very depressed and scared. I quickly became dependent on her support, as back then she was the only person I could really talk to about what I was going through, besides my therapist.\n\nI've been realizing that my relationship with my friend isn't so healthy, bc I'm recognizing how dependent I have been on her for emotional support. What's been especially eye opening though is understanding she created this dynamic between us, and I think wants me to be dependent on her. I've realized that most of her friendships are like this, where she plays a therapist role.\n\nShe love bombs in the form of gushing flattery at me that makes me feel icky, bc people don't usually talk to each other this way. When I get together with other friends, they're not heaping praise on me and telling me how much they love me and how wonderful I am. She will laugh at all my jokes, call me a lot, and seem very interested in all my concerns. If I tell her I stubbed my toe, or got a parking ticket, she will be full of concern and undivided attention.\n\nThen, for no apparent reason, the winds change. Or maybe a switch is flipped. She has been calling me every morning when she leaves for work for years, but she will start calling late or not at all, so that I end up confused and calling her. When we're finally on the phone, instead of the warm affectionate friend and confidante voice that I am used to, I get someone more cool and distant. Her tone is different, more flat and disinterested, and I notice it immediately. I start to feel like I am bothering her or being a nuisance, and like I have to chase her down in order to talk to her. She starts to seem aloof and unavailable in this way that's subtle but I notice right away that something is off. I start to feel *ignored* in this way I can't really put my finger on.\n\nRecently I celebrated my one year anniversary of NC with N #1, which was a huge deal to me, and she had been making lots of excited comments about it. When the day arrived, I ended up calling her and I knew immediately that the switch had flipped again, bc her voice had that flat, disinterested tone. \"Oh really?\" she said. \"That's today? Interesting.\"\n\nWhat bothers me is my reaction to all of this. When she switches into her cool and distant mode, it triggers something in me I don't like. I feel this sense of abandonment or panic and I feel compelled to chase after her for reassurance. I've realized that my other friendships don't cause me to feel this way, and I can't imagine them ever doing so.\n\nThere is something different about my friendship with this woman than with my other friends, and for a while now I've been blaming myself for that, bc of my dependency. I saw this as a personal failing on my part, allowing this to happen. But, lately I've been considering that maybe I'm feeling this way bc I've been dealing with an emotional manipulator, and that normal healthy people don't need to play therapist in their personal relationships.\n\nOne of her other dependents came on the scene in March, another long distance phone friend, and within a few weeks, she was talking to him every day for hours, and was very very interested in his life, especially his breakup with his N girlfriend. He had to go to court to fight a fraudulent restraining order filed by his N ex, and my friend gushed that she was \"on pins and needles\" to hear what the verdict was by the judge. Pins and needles!\n\nThree months later, she's visiting me, and this guy calls her, and she looks at her phone with a \"yuck\" look on her face, and says, \"Oh... it's him.\" She's made this guy the center of her attention for months, made him feel comfortable opening up and pouring out his troubles to her, spent hours listening and advising him, and now he's trying to continue this dynamic that SHE created, and she is acting like he's a nuisance. It was very helpful to me to observe her treating him this way.\n\nI've had to realize, as part of my own healing journey, that normal healthy people don't show this kind of intense interest and fascination in other people's lives, especially someone they barely know. I used to see my friend as this really kind hearted, giving person who gets taken advantage of and can be a doormat for users and mooches. I don't see it that way anymore.\n\n**Does what I'm describing sound like emotional manipulation? I could use some validation.**\n\n**Have you ever had a close friendship with an emotional manipulator? How did you handle it? Is this person still in your life?**",

It was temporary and out of necessity.\n\nIt all started well, but last week I was strongly reprimanded by my boss for a genuine fuck up. I don’t know if my boss is an N, but he is an ass hole, and I also took the fall for a few other things that were not my doing. I was told I would have been fired if I were not Nmom’s kid, and it was humiliating. Nmom and I haven’t been speaking, but she broke NC to let me know the effect this had on her, and to just how horrible it is. Nmom has been giving my personal mail to my boss at work, as she does not want to deliver it to me herself. This is also humiliating.\n\nI am quitting at the end of next month because I’m moving. This has been planned since I was hired, and when I was reprimanded, I gave verbal notice to my boss with an exact date that I’d be leaving. My question is, do I need to go back and give him written notice too? At this point, I do not want to talk to my boss, and I do not want him reporting back to Nmom. Normally resignation letters include a nice “thank you”— but I don’t want to include that. And I can’t think of anything I really want passed to Nmom in writing. \n\nI work an hourly position at minimum wage, but Nmom treats my employment like a corporate scandal because she is my mother. I feel like I’m living up to my new “loser” status at work. \n“I u/Ibakedacakes am quitting on 8/15” seems almost as embarrassing as submitting nothing at all.",

        "text": "I confronted him via email, terminated our work together, and asked for a refund for four sessions:\n\n1. Session when he announced he wanted to read my journal (this is what prompted me to verify his credentials)\n2. Session when he suddenly asked for the full name of my N ex and when I asked why, said he wanted to look him up on Facebook\n3. Session when he literally passed out in his chair right in front of me, due to not properly monitoring his blood sugar before our appointment (he is a diabetic) and wouldn't end the session even though he obviously wasn't well\n4. Another session when he had blood sugar issues and insisted on continuing with the session even though he was mentally checked out and doing things like rambling, asking irrelevant questions, and in general not seeming present and focused.\n\nI told him that I had investigated him and discovered that he is not a licensed therapist but instead a life coach. We had a back and forth over email, and I wanted to share here what his response was:\n\nHe admitted that he is a life coach, but claims that he *used to be* a LMFT (licensed marriage &amp; family therapist) and that he is \"retired\" (he's in his sixties). I do not find this credible. Why would a therapist want to work as a life coach? And he's not retired! He has a busy You Tube channel and a full schedule of life coach clients.\n\nIn his bio, he says he has two Masters degrees, but doesn't state what they are in. He buries mention of his life coach certification at the very end, no doubt to create the impression that he is a licensed therapist. He uses made up titles like \"therapist trainer\" and \"psychiatric family therapist\" in his bio - I sent it to a family member who actually *is* a licensed therapist, and she said there is no such title as \"psychiatric family therapist.\" And that this would mean he has the ability to prescribe medication, which he definitely does not.\n\nAlso note that Google search results list him as a \"doctor\" and as a marriage and family therapist. I sent him screenshots of this.\n\nHe was eager to agree to the refund that I requested, but trying to pin him down and get him to be accountable, was not happening. He would just barrage me with excuses and more excuses, but never address my concerns head on. Like, with the Facebook thing (asking for my N ex's full name so he could look him up on FB), his response was to explain that sometimes it's helpful to see what a person looks like, who he is continually hearing about, so clients will show him that person's FB profile during a session. Or they will bring in a photo. Right... but that's not what my complaint was. He just suddenly, with no context and no explanation, asked me for N ex's full name. I had to ask questions to find out why he wanted to know, and even then the explanation was confusing and I felt uncomfortable.\n\nBasically he was *sidestepping* and not directly addressing my complaints, and throwing a bunch of excuses at me and hoping one would stick.\n\nSo supposedly he's a retired therapist with many years experience under his belt. But shouldn't he know, if that's true, not to do things during sessions like annoying his clients with an endless barrage of noise like loudly slurping on bottled drinks, fidgeting, hacking, sniffling, moving things around on his desk, etc.? Wouldn't it be drilled into him by now, after so many years, to maintain a calm, respectful composure during sessions, like every other therapist I've ever worked with?\n\nAnd most importantly, wouldn't he *know* that telling your clients you want to read their journal, and look up their N ex on social media, are boundary violations?\n\nIn fact, I think his lack of any actual training as a therapist gives him away. He knows an awful lot about Narc abuse, but being very knowledgeable about a particular subject, doesn't mean you have undergone the years of training required to work with clients as a licensed therapist. Sorry, but no.\n\nMy therapist family member, who read his bio at my request, thinks he's a complete fraud and I should report him to the licensing board. I'm still amazed that he had the audacity to lie to me about his credentials when confronted, and do his whole sidestepping, talk in circles around my complaints, dance.\n\nWhat really struck me is how his response to me of making so many excuses, and talking in circles, reminded me of my N ex and how HE would respond to being confronted with his bad behavior. Both this life coach and my N ex, when you call them out, respond with an affectation of innocent bewilderment. And trying to get them to admit what they did, makes you feel like you're a lawyer interrogating someone on the witness stand, bc you have this feeling that they're being evasive and shifty and it brings out your inner bloodhound.\n\nInteresting.",

But luckily I was able to graduate with an engineering degree ( took me 6 years ) .\n\nBut their hatred didn't end there. Even though I ran away from their sadistic hatred towards me in 2008 , they still haunted me and followed me and further tried to sabotage my career.\n\nI battled multiple addictions including, alchohol, smoking and porn. The final one I am battling right now is porn and I think I am finally getting a handle on it. I relapsed after 300 days of sober last month, but I am slowly getting back on the wagon. \n\nI am still trying to become fully independent because due to life circumstances ( dad passing away ) , I moved back and live in the same apartment as my covert narc mom and my malignant narc bro.

This is when they sabotaged my career. \n\n I make around 1,000 a month from my freelance gig and I just started doing ebay last month which I hope should bring me another $500 / month. So far I have only been able to make an extra $100 from ebay , but I am still just in the starting phases.\n\nMy goal is to reach $2,000 per month and I am out of here.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was hoping for some advice to help me change my opinion of something that happened to me that has affected how I feel about myself.\n\nI fell head over heels for this person seven years ago now, and did everything I could to make it work.\n\nLast year My ex of six years left me for a person they were cheating on me with for months. I had no idea until after it ended I had been cheated on since someone came forward and told me that, there were photos to back it up as well of them looking very cosy together about four months before the break up. it was worse for me than just being rejected or left, it made me feel inadequate and devastated beyond belief. I went into a state where I was in denial for months.\n\nWhen several months went by and there was no contact from him, I reached out to get some answers. The response devastated me further, he said that he is in a serious relationship with someone ( the person he left me for) that they have moved country and that we will never see each other again and told me to let it go that we are both free now and said to get real that we were together out of convenience ,when I asked him why he left me for someone else, he then blocked me.\n\nAt that point I realized it was definitely over for good, it was obvious this person I had loved from the bottom of my heart  for years did not, and that he saw leaving me as a good thing that he was fine with and is fine with never talking or seeing me ever again and has no desire to. He had no intention of apologizing, or giving me any explanation. Yet all the feelings of rejection, and devastation were still there and are to this day, a year and a half later after the breakup. I feel worthless in a way, because I let him closer to me than anyone before,    it has caused me to put a huge wall up and not want to be close to anyone on even a friend level, my trust is gone. My personality has become a lot more serious, I used to be open to having fun, having a good time and meeting people, but all that desire is gone. If I am around people I am constantly scanning for any negative signs that mean I could be betrayed in the future.\n\nI have so many people tell me I have dodged a bullet, that he was an assh\\*le, etc...and in ways I agree, yet it still doesn't make me feel any better about it. The worst part of it all is that logically I know even if he was to ever come back I could not put myself in that position to be betrayed again, and I would never trust him or get the image of him leaving me for someone else out of my head. Yet my heart and feelings still tell me I miss him and love him, it is like they are waiting for the day he comes back, and I can't switch that off. I don't want to love him or miss him and it makes me angry that I do. How could my heart still be open to a person who betrayed me in such a devastating cruel way?\n\nHow do I stop letting the fact he left me for someone else stop eating away with me and make me feel so angry and upset? I thought I would be over this by now and that I would have repaired my life and built a new life for myself at this point but I have not, the pain has numbed but the feelings I have towards him are still there? I can't see myself ever allowing myself to be vulnerable or loving someone the way I did him, or feeling the way I did with him. I don't feel special anymore, just a damaged broken person.\n\nBy the way I did a lot of research, and there were many signs that he was a narcissist, because a lot of the time the relationship was all about him, and how it benefited him, what I could do for him, he would give me a hard time for not having friends to introduce him to, and how I never gave him a formal invite to my home etc...he would throw any mistakes back in my face years later, and remind me of a gift he gave me which \"proved\" how great he was. He would deny ever treating me badly even though he did, and could never take any criticism. He also did the silent treatment or would bombard my phone and give out if I didn't want to see him or respond to him straight away. I know it might sound crazy to think I miss someone like this, but there was a lot of fun and passion and good times as well. I also was with him since 18 and so in a way he had a massive influence in my life and the way I was and because of that I feel lost without what I thought was \"guidance\" at the time. Now looking back it was more control than anything. Even though I can see all these things, it drives me crazy to think I still love him. How do I let go of those strong feeling I have for him?",

Her mother died when she was a teen, her father could barely support her and all her siblings. \n\nI could understand why marrying quickly was the solution. \n\nI remember she used to dance. That was her SHIT. Always to competitions, to shows. \n\nShe dragged me along to her classes too. Which i hated, cause i would be bored out of my mind. \n\nBut this was a time where she had a TON of activities to do, ya know what i mean? This was her PRIME. \n\nShe always dolled herself up, dyed curly hair, vibrant clothes. I remember how her perfume would fill up the car. I remember wishing i could be as pretty as her. \n\nMy father, aka the originator of the toxic behaviours that i feel has made my mother as toxic as she became, was really not for any of this. \n\nHe got insanely jealous. Argument after argument. \"It makes me look bad\" he would say. \"My friends lost respect for me seeing my wife dance with another man\" etc\n\nMother tried to keep secretly dancing for a while. I remember this private lounge she would take us to. It was a place she and her dance gang would perform at pretty regularly. the owner, sometimes just let us hang there no charge. Perks i guess, lol. \n\nI remember going for round after round of free orange juice. It was kinda fun. \n\nDespite the men who danced with my mother being out gay men, that still didn't stop my father from hurling accusation after accusation of my mother cheating on him (He WAS cheating on her tho)\n\nFast forward, he won. She stopped dancing. Couldn't take the arguments anymore. \n\nMy mother, who the majority of her life was thin and petite, became obese. \n\nUgh i remember the fat jokes my father would make. How she would go silent. How it made me so hurt and angry i cried a bit at the backseat of the car. How my father called her an ape. How he told her that if it wasn't for him, she wouldn't even count as a human being. He provided for her afterall, right?\n\nThe smell of his spit spreading in the car as he screamed. My ears ringing. I remember how tight my throat would be. \n\nIt really really hurts me to remember. \n\nBut the point is ma, this all sucks, you had a sad life, but i'm not here to be your replacement husband either. I was never meant to fill his shoes. \n\nWhen i got together with my girlfriend, she acted so strangely like an ex girlfriend. It made me so uncomfortable. \n\nWith some distance i came to learn and understand a little bit of why things turned out the way it did. \n\nHe successfully cut her off from her friends and family. Her support system. He made her stop dancing. She no longer felt beautiful. Told her that even god demanded she bow down to him. \n\nMy GC brother has the nerve to talk about our parents being \"fighters for love?\" on instagram? Christ. This family is just so fucked.\n\nShe learned to lie to survive. How to guilt her husband into giving his children money for school, and buying good food they can eat. She NEEDED to play dirty. \n\nShe just can't seem to stop now i guess. \n\n \"Never leave mama, okay?\"\n\nShe made me promise that too. It took me so long to teach myself that promises i made to her as an underage kid that didn't know any better DOES NOT make me a lying, promise breaking, dishonorable asshole. It doesn't have to be a stain on my integrity. \n\nI still kinda feel it though...\n\nSigh...I can't, ma. I can't fix you. \nNobody can. ",

He knows there is something up as he knows I am not in contact with my parents. And his parents are in constant contact with mine, or at least they usually were. \n\nAnd I feel, as I have felt when he wanted to meet before, that I can't meet him - as I am not healed, and I am not sure what way I will be. Neither do I know what my Narents have said to his family. \n\nBut not meeting him is just prolonging my isolation, which is essentially prolonging the abuse. Why should we be held to silence like this? \n\nHow have you managed friends that also know the Nfamily you have escaped from? Do you meet them? Do you not meet them until you are healed? Is it worth telling them your side of the story? Narcissists are cowards after all, so it seems senseless to let them continue to bully and control, and hold their victims to silence. \n\nAnother friend (again of the family) has tried ringing me twice or three times. I haven't answered as I just do not know what to say, or if I do say something he might get the total wrong impression. \n\nWhat is your outlook on speaking up for yourself, versus not buying into their smear campaigns at all by just avoiding them and avoiding anyone they know?

We kept him on for a while because it seemed like we were having a good influence on him but he kept falling back into old habits. After one too many problems built up, I decided to boot him. \n\nWhen he yelled at me in person last time we played, I stayed calm without realizing it.

I was even sort of enjoying myself because I was okay and writing well is satisfying. The only time my past problems showed up is when my heart started beating hard and fast right before hitting ‘send’, and it stopped right after his first reply. And now I feel good about it. I can just move on. I was ready to move on immediately. It's so refreshing!\n\nI don't expect it will go that well if I ever have The Argument with my Ndad because there's a lifetime of abuse and its fallouts there, but this is hope that it won't go completely awfully!",

        "text": "We were 3 years NC because I gave up maintaining a relationship he put nothing into, and he didn't reach out when I stopped.  For three years.  He died last summer.  The funeral was the last time I spoke to anyone in his family and the first time I'd spoken to any of them in years.  My grandmother didn't recognize me, though she showed no other signs of dementia.  She remembered that I had a daughter even though no one in that family had ever met her and my dad had been mysteriously reluctant to even tell his mother about her.  The last time I spoke to my brother was to let him know I'd wired him the entirety of our dad's life insurance payout.  I can't imagine I'll ever talk to any of them again.  \n\nMy husband and I bought the house we live in so that my dad could move in with us.  He was bed-bound due to a gaping wound that kept reopening and festering, and he was threatening to let himself die of infection rather than go back to the hospital or the nursing home they always discharged him to.  We moved a thousand miles from our jobs to be closer to him and bought this house with a ground floor bedroom and a wheelchair-friendly layout and extra space in the garage for his van and his ramp and lots of windows and a deck he could access when he wasn't bed-bound.  It's nicer than anywhere he's ever lived.  We were going to have skilled nursing come in daily for wound care and I would be around for anything else he needed.  Then after we closed on the house he said he'd changed his mind.  He didn't want to move in anymore.  He spent the rest of his life going back and forth between the hospital and the nursing home and the hoarded up, dilapidated house where I grew up, which he also complained about because my brother had moved back home and brought people with him.  \n\nThe other day I saw the monkey bars and the wheelchair lift into the pool at my gym and I teared up.  He has been confined to a wheelchair since he was 21 and hadn't gone swimming or done anything to make his life more pleasant in decades, even though he could have, and I had had all these plans for his life being better here.  And he didn't want that.  He just sort of languished for most of the rest of his life.  I hope he was happy.  I hope he got what he wanted.  Thank you if you read this far.  I'm just having some feelings lately.  ",

        "text": "**Worst/douchiest things your N did. For when you're feeling weak and need a reminder just how awful they really were, and why going NC is the smartest thing you will ever do...**\n\nWhat's your list? I found writing all of these down to be totally therapeutic.\n\nHere's my list about N#2, who I left two months ago. I call it The Dirty Dozen.\n\n**1) The casino incident...** We were on the phone during the workday, finalizing plans for a trip the following weekend. He said he had to call me back, then never does. Hours tick by, and I finally text. No response. I text again. And got a couple of short, cryptic replies. It was a Friday night, and I had no idea where my boyfriend was, who he was with, why he didn't call me back, nothing. I asked him to call me, and he didn't. I did however, receive a pic from him around 10pm that looked like some kind of play or stage performance, and a head scratching text that read \"At a show.\"\n\nThe next day, I found out he'd accepted a spontaneous invite from some of his male coworkers to drive to a casino 90 min away. And somehow during that whole long night, he never found the time to shoot a text to his girlfriend, or give her a call, and let her know what was up, so she wasn't left hanging.\n\n**2) The blizzard...** A huge storm hit our city and he refused to come to my place (I live alone) or invite me to his. Me telling him that I didn't want to be alone during this major weather event, which was going to shut down the whole city, made no difference.\n\n**3) Our 6 month anniversary...** It happened to be on a Sunday. He left my house in the morning, said he couldn't spend any time with me at all bc he was sooooo busy with work and errands, then went home and signed for a Meetup that night in my own neighborhood, which he never told me about. I found out later, after I broke up with him the first time.\n\n**4) The singles Meetups...** He joined two singles Meetups while were were together, that I know of. The second one he joined in January, and RSVPed for one of their mixers! When confronted later about this, he claimed he never went. Note that after I broke up with him the second time, the first thing he did was delete that Meetup profile. So shady.\n\n**5) The ex girlfriend...** His ex before me was a source of jealousy for me bc of the way he would talk about her, and the strong feelings he said he'd had for her. He started up this kind of triangulation from our second date. I'm 95% certain he started talking to her again after I went back to him like an idiot, and pics on social media confirm that he has visited her city since I dumped him the last time (she lives across the country). They always somehow know the thing to do that will hurt you the most, and then they go and do it.\n\n**6) The Mayweather-McGregor fight...** Last August, we'd only been dating a month, he suggested I come along with him to a bar to watch this boxing match. I said sure! Then, the day of the event, he never calls. I called him, totally frustrated and confused, and he was dead asleep!\n\n**7) The day we were supposed to go to the beach...** He shows up at my place, and when I mention I have a headache, he says I should lie down and rest and then he turns around and goes home! I called him a couple hours later, telling him I was fine and I want to meet up. He asks if he can call me back in 5 mins, he's at the counter at the mall. He doesn't call back for an hour. After talking for a few min, he suddenly tries to get off the phone without setting a time to meet. I ask, and we set a time of 5pm. I call him 15 min before, and he's asleep!!! This means if I hadn't happened to call, he would have stood me up. This happened last summer, and in hindsight, it's the day I should have walked. We had only been dating 3 or 4 weeks.\n\n**8) Labor Day 2017...** A couple days before, he suggests going to some festival happening on Labor Day. I say yes, then ask him to please let me know either way, so I know if we're going or not and can plan accordingly. He says sure. He never calls.\n\n**9) Las Vegas...** He accepts an invite from some buddies to spend the weekend in Vegas. This was the weekend before I had to fly home for several days for a family reunion. What guy in a serious relationship takes a completely pointless trip to Vegas with a bunch of male friends, the weekend before his girlfriend has to be out of town?\n\n**10) Cold and businesslike tone during phone calls...** He always created the impression that he only had a few min for me, and could we please hurry up and get this over with? Then I'd see him an hour later killing time on social media.\n\n**11) Showing up for dates in \"power save mode\"...** This is when he would be there physically but there was no one home. He would be cool and distant and withholding. He didn't want to share anything with me, but didn't seem interested in hearing about my day either.\n\n**12) Would sneer \"What?!\" at me if he didn't hear something I'd said.** His whole face would be contorted in this cold contemptuous expression. Meanwhile, if I didn't hear something he'd said, he would often refuse to repeat himself. They are all about reinforcing their superiority in the relationship.",

        "text": "For years, maybe even my whole adult life, I have experienced involuntary fantasies of being attacked. I'm using the word fantasy to denote a sort of waking dream and not a wishful fantasy. I used to get these a lot more. They take the form of my mind imaging something dangerous happening, often it might an intruder breaking into my house and threatening me. In the 'fantasy' I always fight back with any means and I always succeed in achieving safety. Sometimes I might run away and hide. Sometimes my young daughter is with me and I save her too, though I've had these fantasies since well before she was born.\n\nOccasionally the fantasy will take the form of being threatened by something like a tidal wave and I find a way to stay safe. I want to add that I do not feel under threat or unsafe in my day to day life. I feel quite secure apart from when I experience a threat that would alarm a normal person such as someone driving extremely unsafely near me. I understand these fantasies as a legacy of how attacked and threatened I felt as a child. It is still entirely normal for me to automatically chose a seat where I can see the whole room and never with my back to the entry door.   \nDoes anyone else experience these involuntary fantasies? They don't upset me even though they do make my heart race a bit sometimes.",

(I don't consider myself the scapegoat now no matter what they are doing or saying, but it was the dynamic that forced me to leave them).\n\nAlso, I have physical issues from serious surgeries in the past, and I think that that is one main reason they have decided to put me down. Narcissists do not like weaknesses in others,it is part of why they are so pathetic I suppose. \n\nIn any case, I had to leave. And it was a year where I actually needed support, as I had to leave my job due to stress. So when I took the year out to recover, this so called family of mine decided to taunt me (covertly, of course) and give me absolutely no support, especially no emotional support. \n\nSo now the year I took out to, at first, just de-stress, has become the year I have to de-stress combined with losing my entire family. Nor are there cousins or any other family members to contact, which speaks to just how bad communication was in extended family. No extended family have tried to contact me.\n\nI suppose of all this can be framed in a positive way - insofar as the truth is now known, and it puts me in a situation where I will have to sort out my own self-belief and integrity - my survival depends upon it at this point. \n\nFor those of you who effectively lost their whole family to Narcissism, how have you coped? Did you go through a deep grieving process? Were you able to keep working? Or did you manage to return to work if you took time off? How long did it take for your true-self to arise from the ashes, so to speak? \n\nIt would be good to hear your experiences on this matter\n\nThanks for reading",

        "text": "I'm having a hard time finding a mental health treatment option that fits my needs. Because, I believe I have CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and likely a few other things like OCD. But I can function in the world like a normal person when I need to, I'm not like a \"disabled\" adult by any means. I'm just hurting a lot inside, and not living my life as much as I am just going through the motions and hiding my deep sadness inside. But only because I can, and I know in terms of my comfort and quality of life I don't want to be deemed like a handicapped adult or whatever. But I also really just can't keep going like this, I'm not happy, ever, I just \"do\" what needs doing in my life. I feel dead inside and weekly psychotherapy isn't enough. I need more intensive specialists and more frequent treatment because opening up is so hard for me that an hour a week is barely enough for me to even begin to really \"get into\" a vulnerable healing place. \n  \nTLDR; My guard is ALWAYS up, so I feel like residential is the only way I'll be able to get into a place mentally where I can let people help me. \n\nI guess ideally it'd be very similar to a residential treatment facility, but with more of a focus on empowerment and healing, and not all of the restrictions that people with addictions, etc require... \n  \nFor example, I work remotely, so the perfect place would be a residential theraputic place where I could have daily contact and treatment with therapists based on whatever plan/approach we decide on... but I'd also have some free time during the day to sit and do work on my computer and wouldn't have to like have no cellphone or internet access type deal...\n  \nAnyone know if this type of thing exists?

        "text": "Another poster mentioned this, and it's so true! It's NOT normal, especially early in a relationship, to talk fondly about an ex, in a way that makes your current partner feel threatened or uncomfortable.\n\nWith N #2, who I left a couple months ago, he started talking about his ex in this glowing way from our second date! It wasn't anything in particular that he said about her as a person, or what she looked like, or anything like that. It was the *way* he talked about her...\n\nHe would drop comments that painted this image of him having been completely smitten with his ex, and he behaved uncharacteristically bc of that. For example, he told me that was so excited about her that he rushed to tell his parents after only a month. He's Indian, and telling Indian parents that you're dating a non-Indian, is a huge deal. HUGE. He never did tell them about me. But of course, I've got this image in my head of him being so excited about his ex that he told his parents anyway, protocol be damned. And of course I'm comparing this with his choice to not tell them about me, which he was never able to explain. He would just put me off with excuses that he \"would tell them soon.\"\n\nThat's what his commentary about her accomplished... making me feel inadequate bc I worried that his feelings for me just weren't that strong. I would notice that he did things differently with me than what he says he did with her, and I would feel insecure and confused.\n\nHe planted a picture in my head of how he (supposedly) behaves when he's really infatuated with someone, and since he wasn't always this way with me, of course I'm going to notice this, and compare, and of course I'm going to be jealous!\n\nThis ex girlfriend was the only person I ever felt threatened by during our relationship, and I didn't understand that this feeling was entirely manufactured by him. He triangulated her with our relationship from the word go.\n\nI have exes, including a very nice man I was engaged to, who I'm still friendly with. I will meet a couple of them for lunch sometimes. Instead of talking about them in the way that N #2 talked about his ex, which always made me feel jealous, I would go out of my way to reassure him that they were just friends and not a threat at all. I made it clear that I only had eyes for him. I wanted him to feel secure. **This is normal behavior in a relationship!** NOT what Ns do, with their triangulation and manufactured jealousy.\n\nDid you have a N who tried to triangulate you with an ex? What's your story?",

        "text": "I have to see my Nex for a final criminally enforceable protective order hearing in a couple days. I would already have one of these in my state if a year ago I had not been so afraid to face this man, and still somewhat brainwashed. I instead stupidly got an agreed upon injunction, in where it is mostly written like a restraining order but one line in it actually gags me from talking about my abuse to ANYONE. I got this because I was able to just sit in a tiny room alone and never had to testify. \n\nAt the last court date his lawyer was on “vacation” and the pushed it all back. His lawyer made it sound on the phone like I had been breaking the order just as badly and the judge admonished us both saying the next person to break it goes to jail. Without even reviewing the order or case, or looking at all the evidence. (I’ve already been informed by multiple friends in law enforcement that the part of the order against me that I agreed to is not enforceable, without reviewing the order the judge didn’t realize this, and it is actually against the constitution.) \n\nI’ve already had this man hit me and threaten my life and his with a cocked gun. A situation I had to call police for. I’ve had him impersonate me online and get over 1000 contacts concerned. I’ve had him follow me to therapy and send my therapist crazy emails. I’ve had him take pictures of a personal diary entry (about depression nothing worse) and send them to my bosses, friends, parents and family. I’ve already had him trying to defame me with insane projection and reversions of past events in our mutual work industry for over a year. I’ve had him stalk me all the way to Hawaii. I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes. I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together.  I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him. \n\nAnd because now I’m standing up to him (by seeking REAL legal protection), it has all settled a bit, yet we still have to have this final hearing.   All the people that I NEED to believe me already do.  My lawyer is going to try and get me a real protective order and the injunction I agreed to about being silenced removed. I’m TERRIFIED to have to face this in a couple days. To face HIM again and see the other rapist as well. Yet I’ve already been through the worst and come out smarter and stronger. I’m not so afraid that I’m just running and not fighting it anymore. So WHAT exactly am I afraid of? WHAT is the reason of this fear? I mean what’s the worst that will happen and how can it be any worse than what he’s already put me through. I mean I’ve woken up from a bad accidental injury bald and confused in a hospital told that two weeks went by before and I recovered and pushed on. It can’t possibly be as bad as that so WHY am I so afraid now? ",

        "text": "I'm posting because unfortunately my ex and I have mutual friends in common and I run into him and things about him frequently and at times inadvertently, AKA through common social media friends. There is something that I have been struggling with recently and am curious how others have dealt and what to do to get out of feeling so crappy about it.\n\nI'll try to give a very general overview. My (29f) ex bf (31m) of 6 years cheated on me with 2 different women. One was a girl at a party and the other was a co-worker. The only reason I found out about the 2 OW was because he got an STD from one of them and at least had the guts to tell me before giving me something. Honestly, I think it's the only reason he told me. After that he continued to waffle back and forth between his co-worker and I and during a 4 month time frame he confessed to multiple addictions that he had been hiding, cigarettes, pain killers, and gambling. He had tons and tons of porn on his computer including some x-rated pictures of our close friends girlfriends (still not sure how he got those) and a couple of nights he came into the guest bedroom where I had moved to get away from him to cry about the OW cheating on him with other guys and telling me he was suicidal, depressed, etc. I comforted him...not my proudest moment. We were renting a house together and he would leave at night to be with her and if he wasn't with her he'd be out in the living room, on my couch, using my Netflix account, laughing hysterically at Friends like life was a bowl of cherries and nothing was out of the ordinary or weird that the girl he demolished was in the back room shaking and crying over her life being obliterated. I remember I had to take Tylenol PM to make myself sleep and I would literally jump each time I heard his text notification go off somewhere in the house and the front door slamming as he left. It was like he turned into a different person over night and I was legitimately living with a stranger. It was one of the weirdest and most terrifying times of my life. Some days I would come home and he would treat me like I was being ridiculous for ignoring him and ask me to come back and the next day his mood would shift and he would be back on with the OW. The next day, he'd be calling her names and saying what a bitch she was and needing me and then tomorrow he'd be writing her a letter saying can we still be friends?\n\nWe eventually moved out of the house we shared and he took up with the co-worker for 3 months before coming back to me ( I know.....I hadn't learned my lesson and I know that was extremely unhealthy). For 6 months we talked and \"worked on it\". He wrote my long letters about how much he was changing and how he missed me and realized how terrible he had been and blamed it on depression and not knowing what was good for him and always sabotaging good things in his life.  Alas, he left me again for her. During us \"working on it\" he kept in contact with her and convinced me it was her leading the charge not him and what could he do...he was helpless. It would be rude to block her as she was suicidal and needed him to help her still. One night when I was supposed to cook dinner and have him over to talk he just ghosted me. I called him and he was like oh sorry, she just put herself in the psych ward and I have to watch her dog. It was all a mess to say the least. She dumped him once again for another guy and now my ex lives on his dad's couch, has been fired from 3 different jobs, and is a dog sitter on weekends.\n\nI know I'm weak and have self-esteem issues. That has been confirmed and currently being worked on. I know all of this should have me totally turned off and mentally checked out and I am definitely better than I used to be but something still kills me inside. I know this sounds silly but my ex acts as if I never existed. Mind you, I don't expect him to tell the story of what he did to people, not at all, but just the way he has ranted and raved about what a \"bitch\" his ex (OW co-coworker) is has in a way made me wonder....did he ever even consider us a thing or was I just a roommate who paid the bills?\n\nMy other problem is despite all that was done to me he is a very popular and decent looking guy. People love him and he's very, very charming and funny. He has multiple women who adore him, the majority of them women he has met on Twitter or Instagram from other parts of the world or states. He supports them emotionally and tells them all if they ever need to talk or if they have a large milestone he is so proud of them. He's even gone so far as to meet some younger girls from online in person. They have all driven to him 4+ hours from where they live to hang out at whatever house he is currently dog sitting for as his car probably couldn't make that drive. It's so silly but the other thing that unnerves me is he uses a picture of him and my dog from when we lived together and that is like....4 years old on all his accounts and I know it's petty but this upsets me so much. For some reason seeing my sweet little dog and knowing he's using it because, who doesn't like seeing a cute dog, to lure other people in makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nI know it's so petty and let me say I did not do the things I did for him expecting him to be grateful or give me back anything in return but I loved him dearly. He has a chronic illness and I sat through multiple surgeries with him, nursed him back to health, and built a life with him. We also had fun and traveled but I definitely was the more mature and responsible one in the relationship. He rarely had money and unfortunately education and health wise he wasn't in the best place to have a professional job.\n\nI guess where I'm going with this is learning how these internet women and friends were being treated with such gentleness and respect feels so painful. It was like everything I had ever wanted from him these girls that didn't know him were getting 10 fold and thought he was so kind and generous while he told them what a terrible emotionally abusive ex he had to \"survive\" through (again, talking about OW co-worker).\n\nHow has anyone else dealt with your ex seemingly \"changing\" for the better after treating you like utter garbage? I know we aren't together and I need to move on like he is doing but this feeling of invisibility, like I never existed and that he never did what he did is so invalidating and demoralizing. I gaslight myself sometimes thinking maybe I'm exaggerating how awful he was but then friends, family, and my therapist quickly bring me back to reality. I know sometimes life isn't fair but it is so painful to feel like you never mattered and were just a stepping stone on the way to greatness for someone else.\n\nHe has every right to change and become a better person and move on with his life but how do I deal with this pain of feeling invisible and as if I never mattered in the first place? The reason it's hard too is in the early stages when I saw the girls he was talking to and meeting up with (not to sound self centered) but we had a similar look and interests. But not just that, he would start talking to girls he vehemently told me in the past he was not interested in and it was shocking to say the least. The hard part though were the girls like me and it made me feel like something was seriously wrong with me for him to have to go from knowing someone like that intimately for 7 years to someone he found trolling Twitter.\n\nI'm obviously not sure if he's truly a narcissist but I've come here because my experience has a lot of the signs of someone with similar personality traits. To say the least it was toxic be him a narc or not so I was curious if anyone had any advice. Sometimes I just feel so crazy and really question myself and what that relationship was it can be exhausting. I felt like if any place could understand what I'm going to this sub would. My ex was on and off multiple times with me but I feel as if this was the \"final discard\" for him. I am the one that finally cut it off. The last thing he every said to me was \"I don't think this is the last time we'll ever talk..\" and now it has been over a year since we have had any contact and I haven't heard a peep or seen hide or hair of him in any way. Any advice is much appreciated.",

They all have their quirks.\n\nHere are a couple ideas I have:\n\n\\- I'll try to hang out with the 2 dance girls a bit more and exchange facebook, set up coffees, because I know we already get along well in a group\n\n\\- One of the dance girls is a bit of a tag-along kinda girl - doesn't say much but still pleasant company and adds a friendlier dynamic and I know she'd be up for making friends which is nice. But she is shy so I am not going to pressure her to talk too much about herself\n\n\\- I'll try to make sure I find out things that dance girls have in common with soccer girl so they can talk to each other and have points of conversation to bond with\n\nBut here are things I feel nervous about:\n\n\\- The soccer girl is actually friends with a mutual soccer friend we have who is very toxic. I want to get the soccer girl on board but won't know how to deal if the toxic girl finds out and feels threatened..\n\n\\- Also with the soccer girl.. I'm not that comfortable with her one on one.. our dynamic changes when that happens and she feels meaner (but I wouldn't say that she's toxic - she wouldn't scheme and plot). But she's definitely good company as a group friend. But my issue is how do I get to know her well enough that I then feel comfortable inviting her to hang with dance friends.\n\n\\- How do I get everyone together? Working around schedules, best venues and set-ups for fun friendly and relaxed conversation?\n\n\\- I'm worried I'll stray from my boundaries in order to get this to happen. How do I accept failure if it happens?\n\n\\- Is there anything I can do to make sure everyone gets along smoothly and want to see each other again?\n\nAny ideas and help will be appreciated :)",

        "text": "12 years ago, I left an abusive home. I was 16. I had spent 4 months with my adoptive father, step mom and two step siblings, getting screamed at, beaten, socks shoved down my throat, death threats and so much more. The visual memories are starting to fade, finally. But the words... the words are still fresh in my head. They still eat at me every day. Echoing. The hardest part, is that not only do people around me not believe what happened 12 years ago, but... I've heard similar from them. Just a few hours ago, I got to hear my boyfriend's family blame me for the fact we are getting evicted. But the fact is, I've been trying. \n\nEvery day is a struggle just to convince myself to clean. The ONLY psychologist within a reasonable driving distance that takes my insurance, recently had his license suspended for \"sexual misconduct\" Rumor is 10 people in 4 years. The person who prescribes my medication refuses to believe my depression, anxiety and PTSD is debilitating on most days. Has even mocked me while I was bawling my eyes out. Yup.\n\nMy \"friends\" have told my boyfriend that I am \"Lying about my limitations, there's nothing wrong with me\" and \"I deserve to be treated like shit because I don't clean or have a job\" Mind you the latter was said to him within a month of losing a job I loved. \n\nI live in a small town where everyone knows everyone and if one person doesn't like you, the whole town doesn't. I stay home most days because I see the looks. I KNOW what people are saying about me. It's not a paranoia. And... Most days, I don't feel like much has changed since escaping 12 years ago. I don't live in the same town, hell not even the same state... but... Though I'm not being physically abused... I still feel worthless, helpless and like all those things my stepmother said, are really true. I have a few people who believe in me. But most days... that feel like trying to save yourself from a swarm of bees using nothing but a newspaper. And... I only know one or two people who understand how that affects me.\n\nAll in all... I'm honestly just feeling utterly beaten down. Got served an eviction notice yesterday, Boyfriend lost good paying job last month, then had to get a surgery that took him off work for almost 2 weeks, phones are off. I know I've come so far, but I don't feel like it right now. ",

To start over. \n\nInstead I was incessantly stalked and harassed for a year. He followed me all the way to Hawaii, tried to extort me with revenge porn, and impersonated me by hacking into my Facebook and posting an apology letter to himself. So I hired an inexperienced lawyer and got an idiotic civil restraining order. \n\nI got injured BADLY and was out of work for a while in our mutual industry and he disappeared. I thought maybe he was gone and celebrated. Then I recovered and made a comeback in my industry. I was happy and dating someone (who couldn’t handle it), and he popped back up. And I was done! So I hired a REAL lawyer to turn the order into a real criminal protective order, because I’m no longer too afraid or brainwashed to testify, or have a voice. \n\nWhen he found out I hired who I did and that I was refiling, he finally stopped most of it. My work life is good right now, I’m working towards goals and could be so happy. Yet, I feel I cannot pull the filings now or it will only begin again, by showing him I am still weak. \n\nYet I AM AFRAID. Of the retraumatization effect this will all have on me. On having to see my abuser, who brings a man who he knows raped me that I never reported, to every hearing, and any other awful minion he can bring. I don’t want to have to see any of them or hear him speak his insane lies or ANY of it. Even just the sound of his voice sends quivers down my spine. He is my own personal boogie man. I have plenty going for me including a picture of him with the gun, a video of him admitting to assaulting me, and now a letter from the DA saying that they finally have and are reviewing the case, that he constantly lies he was cleared of any possible charges of long ago. (The initial assault.) I am still filled with nothing but DREAD though. Why? And how do I get through this week? ",

        "text": "So, it didn't even occur to me to verify his counseling license. I hired him bc I think he has a really great, informative You Tube channel about Narcissistic abuse, especially concerning families. And he refers to himself as a \"marriage and family therapist.\" He's affiliated with a counseling practice that specializes in helping people recover from Narcissistic relationships. I've since learned that the director of this practice has twice been on probation by the licensing board for ethical violations. Hmmm...\n\nSo what motivated me to look into his credentials, was him very casually announcing that it would be helpful to him to read some of my journal entries. I had to ask him why, bc he didn't offer any explanation. He just made it sound like a completely normal thing to for a therapist to ask a client.\n\nAnother time he asked me, again very casually, for my Narc ex's full name so he could look him up on Facebook. I asked why he wanted to do this, and he said bc he wanted to \"check him out.\"\n\nHe had blood sugar issues twice during sessions (I think he's diabetic). He said he forgot to check his blood sugar before the sessions. The first time it happened, he literally blanked out. It looked like he was sleeping sitting up. It was alarming to witness. He wouldn't end the session and reschedule but continued on and tried to hide how disoriented/brain fogged he was, which meant that he rambled, repeated himself, asked questions that weren't helpful, wasn't able guage that he had beaten a particular subject to death and needed to move on, etc. I wanted to ask for do overs after these two sessions due to his medical issues, but I wimped out and didn't follow through.\n\nHe advertises himself in writing as someone who \"was\" a marriage and family therapist, and who has a degree in \"marriage and family therapy\" from an unnamed school, but I checked and there is no record of him with the licensing board in his state. His credentials after his name include masters degrees but he doesn't say in what, and he is a certified life coach.\n\nI feel betrayed and misled. I wouldn't have any problem working with a life coach who specializes in helping people who are recovering from N abuse, as long as they made it clear upfront that that's what their training is... that they are not a board licensed therapist.\n\nTo me, knowing that he is not an actual therapist explains a lot of his odd behaviors, including casually stating he wants to read my journal entries to \"better understand my state of mind.\" I explain my state of mind very well, thank you. A trained, licensed therapist would know that this is a boundary violation.\n\nAnother thing he would do is constantly fidget and make annoying personal noises. I recorded all of our sessions (his idea), and when you listen to the recordings, they are filled with the sounds of him slurping loudly on bottled drinks, sniffling, hacking, wheezing, moving things around on his desk, yawning, etc. Just a constant barrage of noise from him. I feel like a person whose been trained as a therapist (which he says he has been) would know not to act this way during sessions, anymore than you would during a job interview.\n\n**Would love to hear people's thoughts on this. Would you care if you found out your therapist was actually a life coach? Would you care if he/she said they wanted to read your journal entries, or if they asked to look up one of your Narcs on Facebook?**",

        "text": "Yesterday, my sister visited me after a huge fight with my parents. And I realized how, for the first time, I could name what happened without hesitation and without any excuses for our parents. What she told me was how she upset our parents (because she has anxiety issues and couldn't do some normal stuff) and they got very angry, so that my mum said something like: \"Stop it or I'll slap you.\" My sister said she had massive fear of getting hurt, because whatever she said seemed to make it worse instead of better. \n\nSo when my sister told me, I rephrased it in my head: They threatened her with violence. That's abuse. They deny her proper treatment for her anxiety disorder. That's neglect. (My parents got to keep guardianship, although she's an adult, because of mental disability. She can't decide on her own if she wants treatment or not.) \n\nAnd I was so proud of her, because usually when things like that happen, she would feel mostly guilty (internalized victim blaming). But this time she didn't ask me if she had done something wrong. She came to complain about our parents and to tell me she was treated badly. I feel that she gets out of the fog, too, and that she trusts me enough to show me. I feel she came to be validated and strengthened. \n\nI also feel strenthened. I'm VLC with our parents and in the past my sister suffered from the fact that I don't get along with our parents. I felt bad about that, because I don't want to hurt her. But now I see that it's a chance for her, too, and that it actually might help her. \n\nI always tried to avoid giving her the feeling she had to choose between loyalties, because she is still in a dependent position towards our parents and she is also strongly connected to them emotionally. But I also tried to explain my reasons to stay away in a way she would understand. Also because I didn't want her to believe that she could \"fix things\" or that she's somehow the reason for my absence. So lately, I said something like: \"You know, I don't like when dad yells at me. So that's why I don't visit them.\" \n\nIt's so empowering to see that she picks up on that, while still going her own way in dealing with our parents. Maybe there'll be a chance to challenge our parent's guardianship some day. (I don't want to do that against my sister's will.)",

        "text": "I really hate how messy my house gets. We do the minimum so it's not like it's smelly or offensive. But it gets cluttered really quickly. I find it hard to get into a routine of putting things away. I grew up in a really chaotic, super messy, mostly uncleaned house. Dishes were done but rarely much else. It was semi renovated (half pulled apart) and never completed. It was ugly and cold in winter, dark and dusty.\n\nOf course it might just be I am lazy . . . but I feel my struggle with tidying is probably connected to my history. Also I have been on the verge of utter exhaustion for the last 8 years due to child health issues and caring for elders including MIL with dementia living with us for a year. I had shingles during pregnancy due to extreme stress at the time (not related to the pregnancy itself).\n\nI also don't want Miss 7 to 'inherit' our crappy household habits.\n\nI would really like my home to feel clean and appealing when I walk in but it feels unattractive and messy. Have any of you had success in building a nicer home environment? What's worked?\n\nPart of this is also I have a partner who has chronic pain and he does most of the cooking but not much else. I have to lead the charge to get any other cleaning or maintenance done. He is not a child of narcs but has his own battles with social anxiety, low energy and I think also just a bit of laziness about not liking housework either.\n\nThings improved a lot when I put a list of chores on the wall and we ticked off how often we both did things. He has a keen sense of justice so seeing how far behind he was in most areas made him step it up a bit. I would like him to carry more of the 'mental load' in terms of organising and thinking ahead. \n\nOne of our lights needs attention from an electrician. It's the main light in our living area and has been out of action for a year. I've sat back on this one to see if he'll step up. We're not battling over it because we have a lamp we get by with. This is just one example of something that is usually 'mine' to address by either calling a tradesperson or explicitly telling partner it's time he did it. I am happy there has been some progress in this area though with the chart thing and he likes doing the chart.\n\nI guess I am trying to say it's more complex when you're trying to change more than one person and you are the only one bringing the motivation to the table. He does like a cleaner and less cluttered house but he's less motivated than me to try and achieve it. I've got to be the instigator of change.  \n",

My only saving grace was that I wasn't down to throw my life away, and was pretty serious about college etc. Just a piece of advice to anyone in highschool or college, getting wasted and high at least twice a week is not a way to live your life. It's okay to party and have fun, but it shouldn't be a lifestyle completely (and everything works better in moderation). Surely, you have dreams and that should be your top priority. You can't leave your parents' house or become the person you said you'd always be if your life is a mess due to excessive drinking, partying, or people-pleasing in general.\n\nLaunching my own athleisure brand by September, and I don't think I would've been able to do that if I had not chosen to start focusing on my priorities.",

        "text": "My N and I dated for about 9 months and worked on a huge project together.  \n\n\nIt all started the summer of 2016, when my grandfather died. She was kind, compassionate and cared. She also had a boyfriend. They were not doing so well and I wasn't too fond of her at first until my birthday had passed and I confessed I had feelings for her (I didn't know it but they had already been broken up.) She was kind, sweet, caring, comforting, she convinced me to move back into my parents house to have a more stable life while I finished up my Bachelor's. We took all our classes together and worked on our senior design project together. I needed someone badly because moving back into my parents although financially more stable and more quiet, it was very tough for me to deal with my parents and with the loneliness. I cried, a lot, and I know I \"used\" her to feel better. Not that I meant to. She was drunk and technically sexually assaulted me. At a BBQ she started making out with me and grabbing my junk. Which I would have been fine with if she was sober, but I felt very uncomfortable with that. \n\nFinally Christmas comes around and we're talking a lot but she starts talking to her ex. I didn't like it but I wasn't her boyfriend yet. \n\nFF, January we're hooking up (hands stuff) and she proclaims I'm her boyfriend. (Weird.) She comes from a Catholic background so sex is a sin or whatever so maybe she validated her morals by saying I was her boyfriend. But I loved her because she was there for me. Time passes and she doesn't want to publicly acknowledge our relationship because she doesn't want her ex to know we dated. This goes on for a while and I become more and more impatient and frustrated. In March we went out to a gay club because she liked those and I didn't mind. Then she started dancing non sexually with another guy. Okay, annoying but okay. Then we go to a fair where she invited her ex boyfriend and I was just cast aside. (I dealt with a lot of shit I realized I didn't have to and its so frustrating to see myself type this)\n\n Then on her birthday in April, I catch her grinding on another guy at the club when we had gone. She's still talking to her ex, still not telling him we're dating  (or any of our friends). It happens one more time after that.  We talked about things but she was drunk and I just said don't do it again. She texts me one night drunk saying a bunch of guys want to fuck her. Me furious, wants to know who and she just keeps repeating it. \n\nI make a move to announce it over Facebook and she is mad I did this because she hadn't told her parents. But secretly she told her sister it was because her ex. Then I got tired of everything and try to break up with her and she is sad. We end up back together but she ends up flying to Chicago to go see her ex with her family. She ends up telling him she loves him. We end up breaking up after she \"catches\" me talking to a friend of mine who I had slept with. (I use quotes because she had told me to send her a meme and we were catching up, nothing sexual) I call her out on telling her ex she loved him. She calls me out on me telling my friend I loved her (the context of me telling my friend I loved her was that she was raped and that I loved and cared for her). My ex then denies my friends rape. We end up somehow just becoming friends but I put myself in a situation where she told me not to talk to any of my friends.  She was my only friend. She tells me if we were still together she would have let me touch her. \n\nI end up losing myself and attempt suicide a few days before Christmas. This is pretty much when we stop talking because I called her out on lying to me about a bunch of stuff. About her going against standards she held me to. For shaming me for having had sex with people.\n\nI reached out to her a month ago, and I wanted validation she hurt me. She never said sorry, I had to get her to say I didn't deserve that. She didn't care she didn't want to spend time talking to me, she was short. She said she was being stern and didn't want to tolerate my behavior of crying. She said she shouldn't have dated me, she didn't want to deal with my baggage, she wasn't ready to date. I was a fool for dating her after getting out of a 6 year relationship. I pressured her into a relationship. I had to tell her that that wasn't true. That she was the one who said I was her boyfriend. That was pretty much that. She didn't feel bad for grinding on my friends right after we broke up.\n\nShe's apart of the democratic socialist chapter in my area, and I find it so disgusting that she parades herself for being a good person for being Vegan, Catholic, a Virgin, a Feminist, XYZ.... It makes me so angry that she totes herself as a good person. That I never received the treatment she gave her ex. Her dad agreed that I didn't deserve that and I should have left in March of 2017 but oh well... now I struggle with my thoughts of being a piece of shit who doesn't deserve peace.\n\nI'm sorry for the formatting, I'm sorry this is so long, I'm sorry this is incoherent.

        "text": "It's probably best not to consider how things will be in 10+ years time. It's distracting, and also impossible to predict. \n\nYet I wonder, for those of you who have broken contact with your family of origin (and who have no intention of re-contacting them again whilst you work on your grief and healing), do you see yourself helping your abusive family way down the line, when they need help? Or do you think you will forgive them but leave them be, seeing that they do not deserve your help, given how cold, cruel, and tormenting they have been? \n\nI know it is wrong to be focusing on the dysfunction of the family, and better to be working on what we can alter and improve - ourselves. Yet I wonder what your feelings are on forgiveness, and if you reach a point of forgiveness how will that effect your perception of your dysfunctional family of origin. \n\nAm I wrong to be caught up on this question? I've a feeling I probably am wrong, as if I'm trying to control who I'll be in twenty years time. \n\nI'd appreciate your opinion on it though. ",
