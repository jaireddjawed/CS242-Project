        "text": "For a long time, I wondered if I was broken. Because I didn't seem to be capable of romantic love.\n\nI'm a woman nearing 30. I'm social, fun, independent, and decently attractive (though it's weird to say so myself haha). I've had many guys/friends fall for me. I've been on countless first dates, from apps or otherwise. \n\nI'm a huge romantic. All I want is a loving relationship.\n\nHere's the trouble. I can't seem to stand most guys. As friends, totally fine. But once I go on a date, it's always downhill from there. My last serious relationship lasted 6 torturous months -- and only because I gritted my teeth and said I will stick out this one. I thought maybe if I just devoted myself to a relationship long enough, I would finally experience what everyone seems to feel so easily.\n\nIt didn't work out. The man was amazing. I enjoyed his company. But even after 6 months, if I didn't see him again for a year, it would have made no difference to me. Actually, it would have only given me back the free time I was sorely missing.\n\nAll the relationship advice I could find was geared towards people in love: \"I love them so much, but this problem...\" \"I have a crush, but they don't like me...\" \"We broke up, but I still love...\"\n\nBut what if I feel nothing? How do I fix that?\n\nAfter I ended my last relationship, I decided to give up. Maybe I'm broken. With the sheer quantity of people I've ever met and dated, if none of them was right for me, then chances were that I would never get to experience love.\n\nI was surprisingly okay with that. I already have so many things that make my life full: Friends, family, myself.\n\nThen I met this guy.......\n\nAnd I like him???\n\nThat's never happened before.\n\nHe's no better or worse than anyone else I've dated in terms of looks, status, personality, etc. But there's just something here that can only be described as \"chemistry\". \n\nI just really like him a lot.\n\nIt makes me happy to talk to him, and I gladly take time to do so. I'm a busy woman. That's usually a \"compromise\" in my relationships. But with him, I message him throughout the day and we call every single night. I haven't told him this yet, for fear of sounding inexperienced or blowing this out of proportion... but I've never done that with anybody before in my life. Not even my mom. And definitely not gladly.\n\nEverything is different with him. I have no clue why.\n\nMe being me, I don't have any overly high expectations for this. I'm a realist. Maybe this will last a while, or maybe tomorrow my brain decides it made a mistake and shut off. Or maybe I'll get my heart broken for the first time in my life.\n\nBut I don't care. I'm savoring every moment of this feeling.\n\nBecause I'm capable of this. I'm capable of falling for someone. I'm not broken. \n\nI thought I was done. My romantic life was over, especially as I get older.\n\nBut I guess you never know.\n\nLife is full of pleasant surprises.",

Sometimes I try to start a conversation, and I feel really bad about the way I started it by asking the wrong questions at the wrong time.I cringe a lot about it later and always try to avoid such thoughts, but my mind keeps recalling these incidents, which makes me less confident to start conversations with new people again.In order to improve my conversation skills, I watch a lot of podcasts and TV shows, but it doesn't help me that much. I think it's not a problem of talking with people but a lack of courage to talk with people confidently.\nDo you guys have any good solutions?

        "text": "For years, I have stayed away from the dating scene. I've never been in a relationship. Never dreamt of being in one. A cold household where nobody expressed love didn't help either. I didn't grow up seeing romantic love; it's still almost a fable to me. My parents' broken relationship definitely made me never want to marry ever. \n\nBut being at age 21 surrounded by people who are in their mid-20s made me realize that it does get lonely a lot, especially as you grow older. I am not a huge fan of being in my own company, either. With a history of being severely depressed and being a workaholic to avoid feelings, I have never considered myself \"lovable\". I am not conventionally very attractive, either. Every intimate instance I've had with anyone so far has been a one-time physical thing (mostly under intoxication). And these have been in the past few months. I have ensured I didn't ask for more from any of these people that I've been with. Because I didn't think people could ever love me like that. They could perhaps love me for my body but never for who I was. In fact, I trusted when people expressed lust over people who expressed love. \n\nIt is hard to move away from this mentality when it's been a part of me since my teenage. I still do think that I'd be a burden, that I'd be hard to love. But recently, I have started wanting someone to want me in the way people describe love to be. I want someone to text me at least once a day to check if I'm good or not. I want someone to think of me to be worth their time and effort. It would be cute, I think. But maybe I'm asking for too much. I have always believed wasn't crafted for love. \n\nI might never be able to believe if love did happen to me. But nonetheless, at least now, I have started wanting love at the age of 21. It's never too late to want good things to happen to you.",

        "text": "One of my least favourite things about the internet is the feeling that every activity must be optimised. This extends across every single facet of life that is discussed on the internet, from fitness to health to hobbies to finance. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great that you can go to the internet and get the most effective advise, but the comments (especially on reddit) always seem to lean towards strict orthodoxy and the idea that doing X activity any other way will lead to complete disaster.\n\nA few examples:\n\n\\- Exercise: this one is just a minefield in general, but one example would be the idea that using weight machines will deliver absolutely zero outcomes and you must do the 3 core lifts or you'll be DYEL forever. \"Exercise must follow 'insert guidelines' or you will literally make no progress.\" - half the people commenting on fitness information.\n\n\\- Alcohol: Lots of teetotalers (and weed smokers) act like drinking anything ever will immediately kill you, and if you drink more than the recommended amount (not talking about serious alcoholics, just the weekend drinker type deal) it's an immediate death sentence. Yes I acknowledge it isn't perfectly healthy, but life isn't healthy anyway, we all die at the end anyway. Health must be optimal or you'll immediately die, taking a few well considered risks to actually enjoy your life is something only a reckless maniac would do apparently.\n\n\\- Social interactions: This one is seriously causing damage to the younger generations. The idea that all interactions must be perfect or it's a 'red flag' and you must immediately distance yourself isn't healthy. The endless number of new social conventions that seem to suddenly be essential. Watch clips of people interacting in the 80s and 90s and there seems to be far less latent anxiety and nervousness, everyone was just being themselves. Social interactions must be optimal or they are psychologically damaging, there is no middle ground.\n\n\\- Hobbies: This can relate to anything but especially anything involving making something. Cooking for instance, if you don't follow the \"xyz method\" for cooking this particular cut of meat you are a madman and have completely fucked it all up. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this an actual problem? Is it just inherent to the way sites like reddit work?",

        "text": "So, yeah. I read for 2-4 hours each evening. It's nice. Every time in my life where I stop reading, my articulation in conversations gets noticeably worse. If I had to put a number to it, I'd say maybe 30%. Now, I like being able to express myself well. I'm sure everyone feels that way. And I'm kind of a life-hack guy, as in, if I think there's a better way of doing something and I don't see why I shouldn't try it, I go for it. Raised beds, blue light glasses, meal replacement shakes, anything that seems to improve stuff just a bit without sacrifice, I try out.\n\nSo I got to thinking, if reading gives me benefits to my speaking, could I take things further? What if I started reading out loud? I gave it a shot. And I gotta be honest, I really like it. The first thing I noticed was that there's a bit of an effort barrier to getting started, like when you don't want to get out of bed in the morning. That goes away in the first few minutes. Next, you feel a bit weird hearing your own voice, but that also goes away once you started focusing on the story.\n\nIt changes the reading experience quite a bit. Sentences that I *thought* I was reading correctly in my head, I'll realize that I was parsing them wrong. Reading out loud forces my brain to really pay attention to the flow of a sentence and predict where it will go next. It's improved my reading comprehension a fair bit just from that.\n\nI also find that my ability to pronounce words wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was. Turns out that in normal, everyday conversation, I just happen not to use a very expansive vocabulary. Reading out loud helps my practice speaking words I would normally not feel confident with, and that transfers over to better vocabulary choice in conversations. Speaking of vocabulary, reading out loud really solidifies the 'word gains' from reading. I also pick up new ways of using my voice and new ways of wording things.\n\nAs for the experience of reading, I find myself way more invested in the book. Turns out that voice carries your emotions way further. I'm laughing and exclaiming a lot more. Also, once you get into it, there's just a simple joy in getting to use your voice. It's simply more stimulating and engaging.\n\nI'm excited to see where this takes me. I'm not good at reading out loud by any means, but that just makes me curious as to how good I can get if I try. I've found that the better I get at reading out loud with enthusiasm and character, the more all of these benefits add up, and the more fun it is. It's definitely something I recommend if you have the time, space, and are comfortably experimenting a bit. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "I redownloaded a very old tiktok account of mine recently just to purge/back up the old content and possibly change it into a strictly art/business related account. But I've kept it downloaded for about a week because admittedly the explore page as been funny. Theyve also recently added a feature in the explore page where if a lot of comments are asking about a certain topic, it will automatically take you to a tiktok search page of that topic. This is important later. I have all personalization settings that I'm aware of turned off but I don't use a well protected browser admittedly. \nRecently I have had swelling and pain in the top right of my neck that has been causing pain to spread to my arm/shoulder/temple/chest on the right side, as well as causing my sinuses to drain on that side, so I was doing some shallow googling on those symptoms (I try not to google too much because I don't want to scare myself with WebMD type research as I am prone to medical anxiety). I have spoken to my doctor and two other doctors about it and am getting two kinds of imaging done tomorrow so I am confident it will get figured out soon, and my doctor does not seem concerned. \nReturning to tiktok, today I was scrolling more and saw a tiktok that said \"throwback to when we thought our friend just had strepthroat and covid\" and it jumpcut to her in a hospital with the caption \"it was cancer\". I thought that was weird and not something I'd want to see but kept scrolling for a while and saw normal posts. Then, a few minutes later, I see another post. A normal selfie with the caption \"when you think its just allergies\" and then a jumpcut to her bald in a hospital bed with the caption \"its actually stage 4 cancer\". I went to the comments and it had an automatic link for a tiktok search of **\"thyroid cancer symptoms\". ** I had not previously considered cancer, nor had my doctor indicated that to me. I immediately uninstalled the app. \nIt read my browser data and inferred from the search results, not what I actually searched. I've googled a lot of things in the past week and looked at things that weren't medical a lot more than medical. But it chose the thing that would make me go down a rabbit hole the most. The algorithm is designed without human empathy and I think that makes it evil. \nTruthfully, this side of my neck has felt slightly swollen for years, as in when I pressed on it it felt harder than the other side, and when I bent over so my head was upside down, it felt like not enough blood could ever get through that side of my neck. Only has only now started to hurt and cause the radiating pain, as well as swell and make me gag. I am truly scared. I am sure its just a swollen gland or something I don't need to stress about, especially since the imaging is tomorrow, but the consistency and length of time its been there is whats concerning me. And tiktok is what is making me spiral now. Oh well- only 22 hours until my appointment.",

I suffer with anxiety and depression so I don‚Äôt go out a lot. \n\nI had to go shopping and decided to take my son with me. I got overwhelmed very quickly and didn‚Äôt know where to put myself. I was heading for the doors bcos I felt so hot and claustrophobic.\n\nI ended up bumping into (literally) an older couple who were lovely! The lady began to speak to my son and the man asked if I was okay. No one and I mean no one has asked me that in a very long time and I began to cry. I apologised and said I was fine but he told me it was okay to cry bcos it means we‚Äôre finding ways to cope with our emotions. \n\nWe ended up speaking for over an hour, I needed that talk more than I can express. I ended up with verbal diarrhoea and told this man things that I‚Äôve never told anyone. I went to all the dark places and all the dark thoughts. He let me speak for so long and when I realised what I was doing, I apologised again but he reassured me that it was okay and he was listening. He told me some things from his past and how he overcame them. He finished the talk with;\n\n‚ÄúNever let anyone make you feel small. Never let anyone make you feel like you don‚Äôt matter bcos you absolutely do. Never let anyone make you feel like you‚Äôre not enuff bcos you are and always will be. The way people treat you is a reflection of them, not you. You are stronger than you think and sometimes we just need to be reminded of that.‚Äù\n\nI can‚Äôt tell you how much it meant to me. I‚Äôve never heard words like that before but it made me feel hopeful. They said they have children of their own and they would like to think someone would do the same for their child if someone saw them struggling. \n\nAt the end I thanked them both so so much and went home feeling more optimistic.",

        "text": "I just thought it's kind of weird after all the horror stories I've read and heard from friends.  \nSo basically 3 days ago I felt some sort of pain in the upper back of my mouth. I wasn't sure what it was but it was too little to worry about yet. Next day it got worse. Today I woke up and it was hard to eat because of pain, I also felt pressure and swelling.  \n\n\nSo I called up the dentist and went for a check up. He took a look at it and told me it needed removal and he could do it right now. He said I would not feel anything and it would take 5 minutes, I didn't really believed him because it sounded too good to be true.  \nThey took an xray, gave me local anesthesia, he put his hands in my mouth a couple of times and yanked it out.   \nMy visit took about 15 minutes all in all with the check in, check up, xray, anesthesia and tooth pulling.   \nI didn't feel a thing, but I asked him to give me 1 extra shot of anesthesia which i now regret because it spread to my upper lip and it feels weird.   \n\n\nBut overall I was pretty shocked by how fast and painless the whole thing was. In fact, since I've had like 8 or 9 cavities fixed with no anesthesia, this was the quickest and least painful visit to the dentist in my life.   \n\n\nAnyone else had it similar?",
