That Anonymous donation turns out to be Harlan Crow. \n\nHarlan Crow also donated $175,000 to build a new library wing named after Clarence Thomas. The library was one a young Clarance spent a great deal of his time at. \n\nThat same piece of shit donor gave Gina Thomas, Clarence Thomas' wife, $500,000 to start a tea party group. \n\nThat same piece of shit donor gave Clarence Thomas a $19,000 bible owned by Frederick Douglas.\n\nThat same piece of shit donor donated $2,000,000 for a museum honoring the cannery where Clarence Thomas' mother worked. \n\nThat same piece of shit donor hosts Clarence Thomas on his Yacht.\n\nThat same piece of shit donor provides Clarence Thomas free airfare on his private jet\n\nThat same  piece of shit donor hosts him at his 100 acre estate in the Adirondacks.  \n\nThat same piece of shit donor owns two paintings by Adolf Hitler. \n\nThat same piece of shit donor owns a signed copy of Mein Kamf\n\nGina Thomas also received at least $686,589 from a Koch affiliated organization, The Heritage Foundation. \n\nCharles Koch's daddy built the third largest oil refinery in Nazi Germany. Charles Koch's daddy spoke favorably of Nazi Germany. Charles Koch himself was raised by his nazi nanny for a few years until she quit to return to Germany. Hitler had invaded France and she felt compelled to return and support the fuhrer. \n\nThese people are fucking monsters and should be exposed for who they are. \n\nreceipts: \n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120203155856/https://www.politico.com/static/PPM156_liberty_central.html\n\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/22/nation/la-na-thomas-disclosure-20110122\n\nhttp://www.njdc.org/blog/2015/12/29/collector-of-hitler-paraphernalia-again-hosting-rubio-fundraiser\n\nhttp://www.protectourelections.org/2011/06/28/385/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/us/politics/19thomas.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;src=twr\n\nhttp://parkour.negaah.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dark-Money-Jane-Mayer.pdf",

This can happen, but is extremely rare, which leads to...\n\n2) A convenient Scapegoat to blame so when things come crashing down, the company can rile up the CHUDs by saying \"it's the Minorities'/Women's fault!\"",
