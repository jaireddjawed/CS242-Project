        "text": "Hi there, I was on 36mg Methylphenidate during 2022 as I was diagnosed with ADHD and it changed my life in all the best ways possible.\n\nI stopped taking the Methylphenidate over the December holidays and started experiencing bad anxiety.\n\nI went back to my psychiatrist who put me on 5mg of Lexapro for 2 weeks and 10mg after that. He wanted me to stay off Methylphenidate until a month after I started Lexapro so we can immediately identify any side effects caused by Lexapro. My experience with Lexapro has been great but once I started using Methylphenidate again, I started feeling this strange buzzed/slow feeling in my head. \n\nThe Methylphenidate is not working like it used to and I struggle to stay focused. Could it be the combination between Lexapro and Methylphenidate that is causing these side effects?\n\nThank you",

For the first time i took an ADHD test and got the most severe score (not self diagnosing) but now wondering if i do have anxiety or just undiagnosed ADHD. I don't know if it's worth looking into as I don't really see what could help - I perform really well in exams etc. But my procrastination is so bad I start 5000 word essays hours before they are due, leave work until days before and then don't sleep or eat until its done, procrastinate sleeping until 5am, and have ALWAYS been unable to sit still - constantly playing with my hair, tapping etc to the point friends and family have begged me to stop. Basically, I'm wondering if there's anyway to seperate between ADHD and anxiety.",

I haven't made the switch yet (I run out of Adderall next week) and I haven't spoken to my doc about the new meds yet (this was a little weird; we talked about how hard it was to find Adderall and that I'd be down to try other meds, but I just got a text from my pharmacy that my new RX is ready with no context from the doc? Feels like she probably should have talked to me before I switch meds, no?), but I wanted to check in here and see if anyone else has gone through a similar switch of meds, not because Adderall didn't work for them or had negative side effects, but because they couldn't get any, and if so, what your experience was. I understand all brains are different and I'll likely have a different experience, but I think it would ease my anxiety to hear from others who've gone through something like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

They say you should dedicate the same amount of time you spend in class on your homework, but I go way over that.  I also had a job for 20 hours a week.\n\nOne of my studio classes, though, has such an obscene workload, that I spend about 15-20 hours on it each week.  I tried to hold everything down the best I could.  I don’t want to come into class with crap art, because that’s shown to everyone and critiqued.  If I don’t take these classes seriously, then I don’t take my art seriously.  And if I don’t take my art seriously, I don’t improve, and then I can’t get into the industry as soon as I want to.\n\nThe first month of the semester was hell.  I ended up quitting my job, but I still couldn’t handle doing the work for my fifth studio class.  I dropped that too since it was an elective, in favor of the required class with the big workload.  Now that I have 4 classes, I can manage things better, but just barely.  I don’t hang out with friends, I don’t go anywhere — I just sit in my dorm and do work until the wee hours of the morning.  Three a.m. is an early bedtime for me.\n\nI was talking to my aunt about my struggle, and she told me that it’s nothing compared to what she did in college.  She took a 9 credit course AND worked full time.  I also talked to a girl my age who shares a couple classes with me, including the insane one.  She does three studios, two lectures, and works 38 hours a week.  I gawked at her.\n\nI feel like such a failure.  So many full time students work, but why can’t I?  Why do I take such a long time just to draw — a thing I’m supposed to be GOOD at?  No matter how hard I focus on the task at hand, my mind wanders, and that takes precious minutes away from me.  I feel like a bad student, a bad artist, and a bad worker.  No matter how much energy I give, it just never feels like enough.  Has anyone felt this way?",

Pharmacy filled it no problem.. well that same thing happened this month.. bc of the adderall shortage my dr put me on adenzys ( don't know if that's the correct spelling) and it didn't work at all. So I asked her to go back to my normal adderall and I'd just keep calling around to diff pharmacies until I found it.. So I got back in with them for an appt only for her to tell me she's not allowed to do that. I was so confused because l've been at this same drs office for 10 years and that's never been an issue before.. I understand you can't prescribe the same meds in 30 days, but if it's a diff medication or diff dose my dr in the past has never had a problem sending in a different kind even if it’s before the 30 day mark..But apparently now they aren't allowed too is what she said? \n So I'm just unmedicated for a month which completely sucks, and doesn't seem right to be honest. Because if I had an allergic reaction to a medication that means they still wouldn’t prescribe me another kind if it was before the 30 day mark…I wasn't sure if a new law got passed or something because it's never been this way for me before.

I started noticing it because during the prayer my mind always sidetracks and it’s hard to get back on track where I was.\n\ndoes anyone else have this problem when praying? other than saying it out loud, what are some things I can try to calm my mind before prayer?",

I want to help myself, but it’s almost like I’m incapable of forcing myself to even take the necessary steps towards *starting*. I feel like taking meds, even if it’s not every day, could help so much. However, I don’t want it to become something that I find myself relying on. I also don’t want it to “change” me or make me feel like I’m not myself, something I’ve heard others say, including my younger brother (he no longer takes medication).\n\nThat being said, what do the people of Reddit have to say? Do you all find that trying/taking medication has helped you overall? I know this is such a subjective topic, but any insight could help.",

It has been like this for years. \n\nSo today I went back to that new pharmacy to pick up my prescription, paid, drove home, then opened the bag and took out the bottle. The bottle was half the size of a normal prescription bottle and only half full!! so I got confused and looked for another bottle but that was the only one in the bag. Then I counted them and there are only 30 in the bottle!!!!!!! I checked the quantity on the bottle and 60 was circled and initialed by the pharmacist. BUT they literally gave me only HALF of my prescription and signed it off as the full prescription! How does that happen? Are there not multiple people that count them before giving them to the patient??\n\nI immediately called the pharmacy (7 mins before closing) and told the tech I only received half of my prescription. she said she “checked w/ pharmacist and we definitely gave you the full 60”. BUT THEY 100% DID NOT! \nI told her that they absolutely did not give me 60 and that 60 could barely even fit in the bottle anyway, as it is half the size of a regular bottle!! She said they’re closing in 4 mins and pharmacist isn’t there anymore and to call back in the morning. WTF\n\nI’m just so annoyed right now!!! I just don’t understand how this could happen. I genuinely only received half of my prescription and I’m worried bc it a controlled substance and I have no proof since I opened it at home. And even if I get my dr to write a new prescription for the other half, it was signed off that I received the full amount and processed through my insurance so they prob won’t allow me to fill it for 30 days now!! But I only got 2 weeks worth!! \n\nIdk what to do. Is there anything I even can do?? How do I prove to them I that they only gave me half??",

Gentle parenting. Rewards chart. Chores. He was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 weeks ago and has started Ritalin. His behavior in school has been much improved but at home? A work in progress to be sure. I thought it would be good for him and I to have some one on one time this evening. We took our puppy to the park, my son rode his scooter and we got frozen yogurt, had a great time. \n\nThan we get home and after dinner I asked him to do something and he just flat out said ‘no’. That’s time out behavior, and on the way upstairs he says “why do I act this way” and slapped himself in the face.\n\nI’m crying as I type this because it honestly breaks my heart when he does/says things like that. I tell him that he is not bad, that his behavior itself needs work and I don’t want him to say negative things about himself or hurt himself because a) it doesn’t help him or I 2) because I love him and I don’t want him to hurt. \n\nUghhhhh I am venting and just so frustrated tonight. I love him SO fiercely and to see him struggle sucks. \n\nHe has SO many positive qualities, and I try and focus on those and work on the not so great things (defiance, not keeping his hands to himself, impulse control) \n\nHe’s had two head injuries in the last 3 years-stitches from running around at pre-k and hitting his head on a doorframe, than last year a kid pushed him on the playground and he bumped his head hard enough to require another ER trip and a concussion diagnosis.\n\nHis head injuries were a factor to get him diagnosed with ADHD because I have a big concern with his impulse control. The last thing I want is another trip to the ER and risking a TBI.\n\nMom life is hard tonight y’all…",

Haven't used them yet but they seem to be beneficial\n* Very easy and quick to go from #**want to do thing**# to having setup a meeting.\n* People will quickly discuss what they're doing with you and then let each other get on\n\nCons:\n* $10 a month OR $84 for 12.

I am currently 32 years old. I have bounced from job to job since I could work. I have a degree (but I can’t have an office job and it’s in criminal justice lol) I cannot become a police officer, due to a record. But I have tried being an arborist (couldn’t drive a truck with a trailer worth a shit), front desk at a gym, plumber helper and now I am an apprentice plumber at the union. I just can’t seem to do well, I am not “mechanically inclined”. I just want to get a job that’s repetitive, where I know what I am doing every day. I have been thinking about working as a package delivery driver. I suck at reversing a van but I can learn that. I have a 3 month old child now so I don’t have much time to waste. Also I am taking a 2 night a week welding course but my area doesn’t have the welding I am really interested in. \n\nSorry for the long read.",

        "text": "I meet my doctor every 3 months and he gives me 3 separate paper prescriptions every time for each month’s supply. I have been going to 2 different pharmacies in my area depending on who has supply due to the national shortage and I went to the alternate pharmacy this time and filled my most recent prescription on March 5th thinking it had been 28 days since my last and paid for it with insurance covering it no problem. I realized later that it had only been 26 days.\n\nThe insurance covered the cost and the pharmacists didn’t say anything or ask any questions so I assumed it was the right time to get it filled. I went to the other pharmacy the month before so maybe they didn’t see that I didn’t fill with them the previous month.\n\nIs this allowed? I’m not sure about the exact law in my state (USA) and I don’t know if I broke some rule.",

I felt nauseated, which I can get over, but combined with the lightheadedness and dizzy thoughts/fogginess, it was a Bad Time (TM).\n\nToday I had a whopper meal and it was miles better. I had a bit of the lightheadedness, but 0 nausea, and besides the small heat flashes, I am feeling really normal. I definitely need a more filling meal, possibly one that takes longer to digest so it starts the digestion process better? IDK.\n\nAnyway, long story short, what have you guys been finding is a good breakfast for Straterra? I have 0 time in the morning because I wake up with such little time to get ready. I'd like something that you don't need to heat, and something I could potentially eat in the car.\n\nTL;DR What are some good, filling, grab and go meals for quick mornings?",
