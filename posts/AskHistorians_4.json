        "text": "Hi,\n\nOf course the atrocities committed by European colonists in the new world were horrible, bu the biggest killer of the indigenous Americans were diseases which wiped out the immunologically vulnerable population.  \n\nMy question is: could there have been any alternative to how it played out in terms of disease?  If Europeans came to the new world with humility and gifts and peace, the indigenous populations would have still been wiped out due to smallpox and malaria and etc, right? Just wondering if there could have been any way or approach to avoid that?  \n\nthanks",

If this could be said to be \"anti-norman\" why would there be anti-Norman sentiments? Perhaps this is mostly just \"pro-saxon\" though?\n\nThanks for your time!",

Here's a quote: \"*But our merciful Lord Jesus Christ did not wish that the city should be lost so cheaply that night, and also God wished the prophecy to be fulfilled.* ***This prophecy was made by Saint Constantine, the first Emperor to hold Constantinople, and he prophesied that Constantinople should never be lost, until the moon rose darkened when it was at the full***\\*, that is, lacking the half of it; so the present time was not that at which the city was to be lost, although it is true that its destruction and the loss of the empire which belonged to it was drawing near.” \n\nAccording to Nicolo Barboro, Constantine also said that 'Emperor called Constantine son of Helen, under his rule Constantinople would be lost'\n\nAll of this information is from the perspective of Nicolo Barboro, who is the only person that can be really be cited for most of this information.

I don't have a single story that tells me how he was as a person with his friends or his family\n\nIn the six volumes of \"The historical development of quantum mechanics\" you can find excruciating detail about the lives of everyone even remotely involved with Quantum Mechanics, and yet after reading them I cannot tell one thing Pauli liked\n\nI have searched for articles, biographies, interviews, there's nothing\n\nThe only thing remotely interesting I could find was the time he worked with Jung on his ideas about dreams, something that ought to be interesting, and yet it was all somehow boring\n\nPlease help me out.

Wouldn't Hannibal have to be pretty stupid to think they'd just instantly give up after Cannae?  Even when he sends someone over to negotiate peace terms he also sends them to ransom Roman prisoners which wouldn't be necessary if he was expecting Rome to surrender.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I previously posted my question on AskAnthropology, there someone suggested I try it here as well.)\n\nThis is quite a specific question, so I start with some context. I have done historical research on the impact of the local context (Mende agency, missionary presence, British colonial administration) on the fieldwork of the Dutch social anthropologist Sjoerd Hofstra among the Sierra Leonean Mende (1934-1936). Hofstra’s archive contains fieldnotes on his encounters with Gbessi, a ‘Mende-man who acted like a woman’, and the dream which, according to Gbessi’, led him to his distinctive gender expression.\n\nGbessi travelled around Sierra Leone’s Southern Province (British Protectorate) as a masked Bundu-dancer of the Sandei-‘secret-society’, the female equivalent of the Poro-society. He had ‘quite the voice of a woman’, ‘walked slowly and hesitantly like a woman’, ‘\\[made\\] on the whole the same movements and gestes’ (gestures), and did work normally done by women, such as assisting in childbirth. Gbessi’s mother had been the leader of a local Sandei-lodge. When Gbessi’s mother died, she appeared to him in a dream, in which she told him where to find charms which would make him a gifted Bundu-dancer. Under the surface of a river he encountered non-ancestral spirits (*ngafei*), who indeed provided him with a charm. Yet, the spirits demanded that he would live the rest of his life as a woman, as men were not allowed to dance for the Sandei-society. After three days Gbessi found himself in his own house again.\n\nIn his fieldnotes, Hofstra writes that Gbessi already ‘acted like a woman’ before he ever dreamt of his mother, the charm and the non-ancestral spirits, suggesting that Gbessi sought to ‘explain’ a non-normative gender expression with the dream. It is unknown to me if Gbessi only told this story to Hofstra, as a European visitor with money and connections. However, Hofstra’s Mende guides/interlocutors Thomas Conteh and Samuel believed the story, and mentioned that they knew of more people like Gbessi: ‘who are between men and women.’ They also seemed somewhat afraid of Gbessi.\n\n**Question:** Is there more historical information on the way people like Gbessi (perhaps third gender?), related their gender expression to dreams (or ‘explained’ it in this way)? Perhaps in a broader West-African context? Was it necessary for them to communicate 'the cause' of their gender expression in a culturally meaningful way (dream with powerful spirits) in order to find acceptance in their society?\n\nPS: The background story of these encounters is quite interesting as well, as Gbessi was imprisoned by the Dodo-*ndomahei* (‘Paramount Chief’) at the time. Some bathing Mende-women had supposedly seen Gbessi looking at them, against custom for a man. Hofstra, Conteh and Samuel questioned this narrative of the ndomahei, accused him of 'money-hunting'. Hofstra wondered if British sexual norms played a role here as well, as the mission increasingly made inroads into the Sierra Leonean Protectorate in the 1920s-1930s. Conteh and Samuel stated that the Dodo-women actually liked Gbessi. As they thought Gbessi's treatment and fine against ‘native rules and feelings’ they decided to free Gbessi and help him escape without paying his fine. Later, Gbessi told Hofstra that he had had a second dream, now with both the spirits and the Dutchman in it.",
