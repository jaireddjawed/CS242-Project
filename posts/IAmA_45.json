But hey, why stop there ? Bought a helmet and commissioned a sword and a shield, for the shield I still await the arrival, also bought some linen and going to learn soon how to work on that to make some padded armour. Further down the road I hope to participate in a tournament.\n\nBut along the way I thought to myself. How terribly history is portrayed in polish school, this date here, that date there, this king here, that period there. It's all boring and very polish centred, especially on polish Lithuanian union and WW II. Crusades is a foreign concept to them, as well as \"fun\" in \"history\".\n\nI asked around in the primary school that I attended as a kid if they wanted me to teach kids a fun side of a history and well, imagine a face of a 10 year old kid when a knight walks into the classroom. \n\nI wish to tell kids the fun side of the history, one without dates (because no one remembers them) and without the boring textbook text, so ask me anything\n\nProof https://m.imgur.com/a/RsXBdkH\n\n(Edit: spelled \"proof\" wrong)",

The methodology comprises the following  steps: 1) extracting features that model  different dimensions of  speech, namely phonation, articulation, prosody, and phonology, 2)  training an i-vector extractor, 3) extracting i-vectors from the  features of the test signals, namely from PD patients and age balanced  healthy controls (HC), 4) processing and analyzing these i-vectors.\n\nThe  extracted i-vectors were used to classify between PD patients and HC,  assess the neurological state of the patients according to the Movement  Disorder Society--Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS),  and assess of the dysarthria level according to a modified version of  the Frenchay Dysarthria Assesment (m-FDA).\n\nMy  experiments show that this methodology has a classification accuracy of  up to 80&amp;#37;, and a Spearman's correlation of up to 0.54 with the  neurological state and of up to 0.72 with the dysarthria level of the  patient.\n\nMy thesis has been approved and I am waiting for my thesis defense.\n\nIn  the meantime feel free to Ask me Anything about Parkinson's speech,  speech analysis, speaker verification, i-vectors, etc.  :)\n\nProof:\n\nThe front cover of my thesis along with my username [https://imgur.com/HVcefuy](https://imgur.com/HVcefuy)\n\nMy Google scholar page: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hq5r60AAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hq5r60AAAAJ)\n\nSome of my articles:\n\n[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/edad/4b36bf583c4949dd2f1272b143309f300bcd.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/edad/4b36bf583c4949dd2f1272b143309f300bcd.pdf) (this one is free and quite condensed)\n\n[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24033-6\\_10](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24033-6_10)\n\n[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7743364/](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7743364/)\n\nOur research group webpage: [gita.udea.edu.co](https://gita.udea.edu.co/)",

        "text": "Greetings, Reddit!\n\nI'm the author of *Stay Awhile and Listen*, a trilogy of documentary-style books that chronicles the history of Diablo 1-2 developer Blizzard North and WarCraft/StarCraft developer Blizzard Entertainment. The first *Stay Awhile* was published in 2013. *Stay Awhile and Listen: Book II – Heaven, Hell, and Secret Cow Levels* is [currently funding on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davidlcraddock/stay-awhile-and-listen-book-ii) in paperback and Kindle editions, and explores the making of StarCraft, Diablo 2, and the two Blizzards' history, culture, and development processes from 1997 through the summer of 2003.\n\nI've spent the past 10+ years interviewing over 60 developers about the two Blizzards: their history, their culture, and the making of their games. Want an early peek at *Stay Awhile and Listen: Book II*? How about several, in the form of sample chapters? Read about creative turbulence surrounding [Diablo's Hellfire expansion](https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/6/29/17517376/diablo-hellfire-expansion-behind-the-scenes-trouble) on Polygon; check out tales from [StarCraft's trenches](https://www.pcgamesn.com/starcraft-history-stay-awhile-and-listen-book-2) on PCGamesN; visit US Gamer for the rundown on the making of Diablo 2's [Amazon character](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/stay-awhile-and-listen-book-2-blizzard-north-diablo-2-book-excerpt); hit up Shacknews to learn about the making of Diablo 2's [desert-themed Act](http://www.shacknews.com/article/105720/how-diablo-2-evolved-from-gothic-horror-to-epic-fantasy) as well as the game's shift in tone and themes; and stop by Gamasutra to learn how [Diablo 2's skill trees](https://gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidCraddock/20180706/321425/How_StarCraft_and_Shower_Epiphanies_Influenced_Diablo_2s_Design.php) were made.\n\nGot a question about Blizzard North, Blizzard Entertainment (\"South\"), Diablo, StarCraft, WarCraft, the chat gem in Diablo 2's Battle.net interface, or how I got my first (and only) SoJ? I'll be around beginning at 3pm ET / 12pm PT so you can AMA! ([Proof](https://twitter.com/davidlcraddock/status/1015302897104572417).)\n\nEDIT #1 (650pm ET): Thanks for your questions, everyone! *Stay Awhile and Listen: Book II*'s Kickstarter will run through August 3, so check out the sample chapters above to determine if the book interests you. Enjoy your weekends!",

I collaborate with scientists worldwide supporting wildlife research with the use of specialized cameras, like Crittercams that can be worn by all kinds of animals—on land and underwater—collecting video to learn about the hidden parts of animals' lives. Footage from Crittercams deployed on emperor penguins appeared in “March of the Penguins.”\n \nAnd I’m Tom O’Brien (pictured right), the Photo Engineer (a mechanical engineer) working for National Geographic Magazine. I design and build custom photography equipment, such as camera traps and robotic camera systems, for National Geographic photographers of all types (portraiture, underwater, adventure, etc.) all over the world. Sometimes I get requests for typical camera gear that’s needed in XYZ country in 3 days, and other times, I have to fabricate the custom equipment myself. Follow me on instagram @Mehcanicalphoto for more insights to what I do and what we get up to in the basement.\n \nWe’ve both been tinkering away in the imaging lab at the National Geographic headquarters for a combined total of 20 years.
