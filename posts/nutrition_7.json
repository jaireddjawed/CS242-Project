Yes, I realize this isn't the case for all stevia but for the brands I tend to get, this is the case. Powdered stevia doesn't seem to dissolve very well in my drinks, so I tend to prefer the liquid version. \n\nMy question is this:  \nIt is about 12% alcohol, and a few drops are being used. This means that the alcohol content I am consuming is literally 12% of a few drops. This leads me to believe the alcohol is negligible. Would consuming this on a daily basis (as I have been) present any long term issues? I do feel it is not enough alcohol to have negative impacts on my health, but figured I would ask for another opinion since I can't seem to locate anything via Google on this.",

        "text": "I often have a tough time eating food, and I cope by eating a fuck ton of protein / cereal bars. Not like the full-cardboard tasting proteins bars and not candy \nbars, but bars like special K that are primarily grains, nuts, and chocolate. How do people feel about eating like this? I feel like it provides calories and is relatively healthy, so I think they're my best bet for getting nutrition when I otherwise cannot. I would love to hear other people's opinions, though!",
