        "text": "I'm running a Pathfinder game (it's like D&amp;D), and my players are approaching an area with a riddle, problem is I'm not the best at making riddles up, so would like some second opinions if it's wrong or un-solvable or anything of the sort.\n\nSet-up: The player's enter a room with a large table at it's center, an area to stand and view the table is clearly marked on the floor. The table contains a large clock within it that moves quickly (hour hand shifts once a minute), and around the table are twelve bottles, three of which are empty, the other nine contain a different color liquid.\n\nThe colors starts with Yellow at twelve o' clock, and completes a color wheel from there. The missing colors are marigold (orange + yellow), green, and aquamarine (green and blue) Three bottles are smaller than the others.\n\nOnce positioned in front of the table, it speaks:\n\nWelcome dear travelers, to a challenge for five\n\nFrom which horrors do you flee, that you should arrive?\n\nThis challenge is maddening\n\nSo pray hear my rambling\n\nAnd you might be so lucky as to escape alive\n\nThis device is quite outstanding, it isn’t like other clocks\n\nThe minute hand moves more quickly, the heavens it unlocks\n\nIn the center, a decanter\n\nHas a happily ever after\n\nThe hour is able to clear it’s path of hemlock\n\nThree bottles are smaller than their friends, and as this riddle implies,\n\nEach are unique: one saintly, one evil, and the last a nice surprise\n\nPlum wine can be found\n\nAmidst what shouldn’t be down’d\n\nNear the shortest of us is poison, if you look ahead one step clockwise\n\nAfter some wine, you may want to start mixing\n\nTwo doses of poison, the decanter is missing\n\nOne from the sea\n\nThe other for free\n\nOnce finished you’ll drink, and your prize you’ll be kissing\n\nTwo more things should be said, yet this info isn’t relevant\n\nThe news may be useful, and I’m feeling benevolent\n\nOrange governs time\n\nAccording to this rhyme,\n\nOne mixture can be found producing a drink so decadent\n\nThe object here is to mix Aquamarine with Violet in the center of the clock, then drink the result to find an artifact they have been tracking down. The catch is that Aquamarine contains yellow (poison) and Violet is poison as well, I'm hoping the line about clearing hemlock will be enough for them to realize it takes the poison out of the pigment. And the line \"after some wine, you may want to start mixing\" is supposed to imply that violet is \"after\" the plum wine.\n\nThanks for all the help!!",
