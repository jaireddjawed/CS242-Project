They will grow up into a generation of adult male virgins who won't know how to talk to girls, won't know how to drive, won't know how to prepare and cook food, and won't ever have had even an entry-level job. This attack on developing a useful repertoire of skills will leave these young men with greatly impoverished lives. \n\nSo why would any \"futurist\" consider this outcome a good idea?",

Then maybe I could pursue Synthetic Biology or Biotechnology in grad school. \n\nIs this a good plan? And does it matter where you go to college?

        "text": "This is what emotional technology is...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u45-x0-zoY\n\nHow many people do you know have had stress related health problems? \n\nOr have had to have time off work due to stress, or take medication for anxiety?\n\nMany people are chronically stressed and anxious, people often cope with chronic stress and anxiety thorough various addictions; food, legal and illegal drugs (overwhelmingly, daily cigarettes and alcohol), porn, etc. \n\nStress related diseases are a serious problem and can be fatal (google the statistics and research for yourself), the effects of chronic stress also lead to time off work, and the breakdown of relationships.\n\nHelp either comes in the form of; relaxation training (meditation, yoga, etc), therapy, and/or psychiatric medication.\n\n*Relaxation training - This often requires sustained effort to* *develop the skill, to get noticeable and habitual benefits. And* *some people (ADHD sufferers, those in a period of deep distress,* *severe anxiety, and PTSD sufferers), have very low ability to put* *forth the sustained focus and discipline needed to develop the* *skills.* \n\n*Therapy - Can be costly, can have waiting lists, and requires trial* *and error to finding therapists and modalities that work for you.*\n\n*Psychiatric medication - Medication undoubtedly works for some.* *However, some people get side effects, and/or become addicted.*\n\nAll the above solutions require money, cognitive effort, and can't be available to everyone (especially people living in remote areas).\n\n**Another solution to the global problem of chronic stress and** **anxiety is the development of emotional technology.**\n\n*Melomind* (I have no affiliation with the product/company) is a product that is a consumer grade neurofeedback device, aimed at creating relaxation responses. It is a headset that monitors brainwaves, and tailors sounds/music to create a relaxation response. This could prove to be incredibly useful for the people with stress and anxiety issues, a 'no effort required' tool that creates a personalized relaxation program. With frequent use, the algorithm become more efficient at triggering a relaxation response.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT5vSVILES0\n\n*Affectiva* (I have no affiliation with the company)  has emotion recognition software that is available to developers. The software can recognize - using consumer cameras (they have demonstrated it's use on a tablet) - displays of emotions; sadness, happiness/joy, etc. Imagine if someone took the software and took uplifting phrases/sounds (ones found to be effective in positive psychology research), and created an algorithm that created a personalized program that triggered displays of happiness. *That way; bullied* *teens, people with neglectful or abusive parents, people with low* *self worth, etc, could turn on their phone, open an app, and* *receive a daily hit of phrases/sounds that lift their mood.*\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iQiGpSmQ74\n\nI think that tech (hardware and software), is the only way to begin to deal with the stress and anxiety on a mass scale. Smartphones are almost universally available and affordable - I think we can use this tech to improve mental healthcare.\n\n*Elon Musk is someone who has an insatiable drive to spearhead* *civilization in a new direction of green energy, automated mass* *transportation, and colonizing Mars.*\n\n*He has a big ego, he enjoys his wealth, but first and foremost he* *is a visionary who wants to help civilization.*\n\n**IMO we need an Elon Musk of emotional technology. Someone** **who wants to develop apps, and tech that are effective and** **affordable to the masses, to help deal with the amount of** **chronically stress and anxious.**\n\nMoney can be made by selling the tech to healthcare providers, as a personalized, affordable and effective way of dealing with stress and anxiety.\n\nMoney can also be made by selling tech to corporations, because it will help reduce time off work due to stress.\n\n**I hope this post inspires a transhumanist to try to become the Elon Musk of emotional technology.**",

Busting my ass to do good science late into the night to work towards making replacement organs.\n\nSo many questions unanswered. Most importantly, how is she even doing any of this? What are the protocols? She's using an AAV to transfect cells with telomerase? What type of AAV? What's the sequence of the DNA she's injecting herself with? How many cells transfected? What cells were transfected? Do those cells stick around? (leukocytes is a broad term and a lot of them die within weeks to months). Not even a mention of the number of cells whose telomeres were lengthened (most likely only a few, vectors are terribly inefficient at delivering genes) - sources from reputable journals and scientists: http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v18/n3/full/mt2009286a.html , http://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-10-74 . We didn't even discuss the plethora of other cause of aging.\n\nIt's a scam and it was obvious from day 1. She's as illegitimate as they come. It infuriates me that she's selling this crap to the uneducated. No data was presented! Anecdotal crap. It's not like me to disparage someone, but if they are claiming to have reversed aging with no data, not even detailed methods!, they've earned it. Liz Parrish is a clueless non-scientist. Here whole company, site, and talk of \"we\" is just one person, her. There's no substance to any of it!\n\nPlease, for the love of science, I'm begging you, don't buy this crap.
