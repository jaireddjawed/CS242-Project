A directly linked way to connect to discuss the material would help. The readers can come from varied backgrounds and points of view, which is ideal for enrichment. \n\nThe editors could add the conversation hubs such as local [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [free4talk](https://www.free4talk.com/), [Schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world/), [discord](https://discord.com/), [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/), [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) on the article talk page and a central calendar or on the site annotation ([hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)). Linking to the existing meeting sites with facilitator present and safety measures would lower the risks. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "I have been long thinking and looking into research on how education can be sustainable, safe, quality, accessible, and scaleable. I see three issues with sustainability: The under-representation of lower-resourced communities that have a higher threshold to development of and access to the content relevant to them; the shift toward a lack of open licensing to gain finances for high-quality content; and the financing models that compromise the safety/privacy/comfort (ads) or divert the focus from the crucial work (grants, crowdfunding).\n\nA solution could be creating a pay-what-you-want remixable space where people could search, donate to, and interact with the open resources and each other via collaborative editing and discussions. The closest I found are [Amazon Ignite](https://ignite.amazon.com/#/),[ Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/),[ TeacherPayTeachers](https://teacherspayteachers.com/), [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors),[ itch.io](https://itch.io/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Learning Webs](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208191528/http://ournature.org/~novembre/illich/1970_deschooling.html), [Schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world/), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), [Anagora](https://anagora.org/), and [Wiki](https://www.wikipedia.org/). Out of these, [Wiki](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is the most malleable. There could also be links to external platforms for discussions on the article talk page.\n\nTo support the open content creators there could be a sister site where authors can post or list the link to their openly-licensed content listed with donations or [web monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) to give to Wiki. I put an offer on the [Reward board](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reward_board#Get_a_donation_for_donating_your_open_content_to_Wikimedia) in line with [Safe Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Paid_editing_(proposal)#2_important_topics) paid-article policies. The upcoming grants of the [2030 Movement Strategy](https://2030.wikimedia.org/) go toward sustainability, accessibility, and bridging content gaps. There are risks in introducing monetization. I see it as worthwhile to experiment with as there might be extensive potential benefits. What are your thoughts?",
