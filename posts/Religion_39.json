I mean it’s well documented that they were only transmitted orally until over 200 years after the prophet’s death.\nAnyhow that’s not the point. The point is I asked this question in another forum and was quite surprised by the amount of people who just took these texts as infallible texts at face value. A lot of people said that the scholars did the work and have a process in place that varify the authority of these texts etc and therefore all texts in hadiths today are authentic. They asked why I would doubt such a thing? I mean even the scholars themselves still doubt them and have debates and disagreements about them. I don’t mean any disrespect to anyone but what is the harm of being a little inquisitive?\n\nSo my question is Is this sort of blind belief common, is it in all religions or have I just chanced upon this group by accident and they are a minority and what can be done about this ?",

        "text": "14 books in the New Testament have historically been attributed to Paul, but academia has cast doubt on some of these books authorship. Should the Bible therefore be revised? \n\nWe know that outside the Bible, many unaccepted books and letters / forgeries were floating around in Paul's name. Epistle to the Laodoceans, 14 correspondence letters between \"Paul\" and Seneca, 3rd Corinthians etc. \n\nIn 2nd Thessalonians (a book determined not to be written by Paul by most secular scholars), there is a depiction of what will happen at the end of time, which runs directly contrary to that of 1st Thessalonians. Also, in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2, there is a warning about a letter circulating in Paul's name that he did not write, so  don't read it. Was that letter 1st Thessalonians? At least here we prove from the Bible that forgeries are floating around in Paul's name. Either Paul is directly stating there are forgeries in his name, or an imposter is writing in Paul's name himself here. So the Bible itself is confirming the existence of forgeries in the time of the writings. \n\nSo. There are forgeries going around. What were they?\n\nThe books that essentially everyone agrees Paul definately wrote are Galatians, 1st Thessalonians, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Romans, Philippians and Philemon. \n\nIt is disputed that Paul wrote 2nd Thessalonians, Colossians, and Ehpesians.\n\nStrong conscensus even in the religious community says Paul did not write the \"Pastoral Epistles\" 1st and 2nd Timothy, or Titus. \n\nEssentially no one now believes Paul wrote Hebrews, and rejection of Paul's authorship here goes back to the 3rd century. \n\nIf we look at the very first binding of the New Testament by Marcion, it included 10 books attributed to Paul. The 4 books not included were 1st and 2nd Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews, the same 4 books that have been questioned most over time, and are today considered the most clear forgeries. \n\nFather Raymond Collins said \"By the end of the twentieth century New Testament scholarship was virtually unanimous in affirming that the Pastoral Epistles were written some time after Paul's death...\" The Catholic Church now says that the authorship of these books is not important / if they got in there it's by divine will (something like this, citation needed - Volaer?). But should books that were accepted into the Bible under false pretences, and are now accepted as not written by Paul really be grandfathered in just because that's how it's always been? Should the church have a new council to reset the canon based on our more accurate understanding of the authenticity of the books? At least with Hebrews? Or is tradition more important?",

        "text": "I'm reading through AW Pink's [Eternal Punishment](https://www.chapellibrary.org/book/epun/eternal-punishment) and doing a line-by-line refutation on my [blog](https://laborer.substack.com/p/annihilation-of-the-wicked-part-1). I shall deal with the more nuanced aspects of the eternal conscious torment doctrine, refute the platonic doctrine of the soul etc. as I get further into his essay but one of the things that stood out to me immediately is the idea that we are obligated to confront atheists with the ultimatum that if they do not repent, they will suffer in hell for it. A quote from page 5:\n\n\"The need of giving this solemn subject a prominent place in our witness is apparent, for it is our bounden duty to warn sinners of their fearful peril, and to bid them flee from the wrath to come (Mat 3:7). To remain silent is criminal; to substitute anything for it is to set before the wicked a false hope. The great importance of expounding this doctrine, freely and frequently, also appears in that, excepting the cross of Christ, nothing else so manifests the heinousness of sin—whereas every modification of eternal punishment only serves to minimize the evil of it.\"\n\nIndeed the referenced passage does tell of John the Baptist warning the religious authorities to flee the wrath to come. Putting aside for the moment whether he was speaking about the final judgement or the destruction of the temple, it's clear that Pink mistook a description of an event for a commandment, and secondly, does not account for how greatly disputation between leaders of rival sects of 2nd temple Judaism would differ, realistically speaking, from debates between Christians and atheists. The citation mentions Pharisees and Saducees, among whom both there was a consensus view held that Elohim exists (obviously) . The matters they disagreed upon stemmed from their respective interpretations of the Torah, though the Saduccees held that there is no resurrection of the dead, like atheists.\n\nMessiah gives *actual* commands in Matt 7:6, Matt 10:11-15 to his students about how to witness to outsiders. You can read Acts 17:29-33 and 18:4-6 for instance, and see if these commandments are not followed to the letter by the apostle. You'll notice in the 1st citation from Acts, that even though the apostle does touch upon the resurrection and judgement of the dead, he does not make an explicit mention of what form that judgement will take (annihilation, hell torments, remediative punishment or anything else). Acts 18:4-6 -- no appeal to hell torments or anything of that nature to convince the unbelievers in the area they were travelling through.\n\nSo what say you? Does the Christian preach the gospel to the atheist, and leave them be if they do not recant? Or invoke hell/annihilation/whatever escatalogical school you belong to as a last-ditch attempt at conversion?",

And in such an interconnected world, I can't bring myself to believe that my religion is surely the right one.\n\nWhat do I believe then?\n\n* I believe that there is a secret order in the beauty of everything, and that this order itself is a manifestation of God. Not that God created it but God is \\*it\\*. Similar to how a sculpture has many sides, each side of the world shows one of the many faces of God.\n* I believe that all religions talk about the same God. Religions are humanity's effort to understand God, and as new religions come to be, we understand him/it more.\n* I believe that morality is constantly evolving. Moral laws are useful, but what was immoral a thousand years ago may be moral today. So there must be constant evaluation of what we consider moral and immoral, nothing is set in stone. For example, same sex relations may be immoral if population is so small and struggling to the point that a higher birthrate is critical its survival, but prohibiting them in large populations is immoral because it's restricting personal freedom for no reason.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be looking to fit into a box, but I'm just curious if anything close to this exists.",

(sorry if that seems rude.)\n\n\nthere cannot be happiness without sadness, it’s impossible for there to only be one end of a spectrum. so, can there still be famine and homelessness in heaven? if everyone is housed and well fed, wouldn’t people take it for granted and turn into bad people? would they be- for lack of a better word, corrected somehow?\n\n\nhow can so many people be happy with the knowledge that possibly significantly more people are in perpetual agony?\n\n(how would perpetual work? what is eternity in the afterlife?? forever, like space? or can we die again in a way? maybe humans just can’t comprehend that either. like space.) \n\n\nwould people really go to hell for comparatively insignificant things? like having a bad addiction, or theft? compared to, murder, or rape, or the other bad ones. i presume there are multiple “levels” of punishment in hell, but, that’s not what i’m getting at. \n\n\nthis is where this may seem a little rude. once again, i really don’t mean to be rude at all. \n\nwouldn’t people in heaven even cry for people who fell victim to things like hard drugs? or feel bad for people who lied because of possible mental illness? wouldn’t people cause uprise to “free” people who are suffering for lesser sins, and would they be punished? would heaven then be ruled by fear of punishment, and would it no longer be happy at all? at some point, would religious figures even be seen as something as far as dictators?\n\n\n\nanyway, if you don’t feel like answering all that, how does the eternal contentment work? i don’t know if human minds are meant to handle that for eternity. i really do think a lot of people would go crazy. \n\nthank you.",

        "text": "So lets give some information and context here. It is 1989. The world's eyes are fixed on the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the Cold War. But while this is happening another event is taking place. A group of Jesuit priests have been murdered by the military dictatorship of El Salvador and its CIA trained battalions of its military. El Salvador has been in the midst of a civil war between the American backed dictatorship and Cuban backed communist guerillas fighting the dictatorship. In the name of fighting \"communism\" the dictatorship initiates repressive measures resulting in the deaths of 75,000 people. These deaths include of course the assassination of the famous Archbishop Oscar Romero who is now a martyr and saint.\n\nThe organs of repression used by the dictatorship include the infamous death squad known as the ORDEN and the military battalion known as the Atlacatl Battalion. The ORDEN was known for their extermination campaigns in peasant villages where they would burn down homes and take the infants of mothers and either drown them or kill them with machetes in front of their mothers as a form of psychological warfare. Oscar Romero, because of his denunciations of the crimes of the ORDEN was ultimately assassinated by one of its members. The Atlacatl Battalion used the same tactics as the ORDEN on a wider military scale. This resulted in infamous incidents such as the El Mozote massacre where in one day the Battalion massacred 1000 civilians where the separated the men from the women and locked them in the local Church, convent and houses. The tortured and executed the men first, and then separated the women from their children, murdering them with machine guns after raping them and engaging in sexual violence. For other victims they were decapitated.\n\nBoth the ORDEN and the Atlacatl Battalion where formed and trained by the \"School of the Americas\", and organisation created by the United States Defense Department with the goal of supporting anti communist regimes and movements. This would lead to both repressive dictators as well as death squad leaders being some of its leading graduates in America's Cold war strategy in Latin America. In this context the Jesuit priests, following the example of Oscar Romero, would end up being outspoken advocates for both human rights as well as a peaceful settlement between the government and the rebels. Because of the dictatorship's antagonism to the Church since Oscar Romero's time the regime ended up considering the Catholic Church to be just as much an enemy as the communist guerilla for supporting \"subversion\". Particularly the Central American University that the Catholic priests ran which they said was a \"refuge\" for subversive activities and leaders.\n\nSo the regime ordered the Atlacatl Battalion to launch a military raid on the university campus. It was disguised as a false flag operation where the military battalion took on the insignia of the rebels so the communist guerillas could be blamed for propaganda. The marched the priests out into the gardens of the university and had them lie face down before having them all shot. Despite attempts to cover up these crimes, the military was quickly suspected of being behind this, leading to international condemnation. This would increase the pressure for a peaceful settlement which would include actors such as the U.N, the things the Jesuits died for. This eventually leads to the Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1992 as well as El Salvador's own Truth Commission in 1993. Many of the killers initially where able to escape justice both through the government's amnesty law as well as fleeing to countries like Spain and the United States which backed the dictatorship. Initially the U.S government was unwilling to hand over the killers. However things began to change when Spanish courts initiated legal proceedings against those that fled. Eventually President Obama(who visited El Salvador and paid respects to Oscar Romero's tomb) had his administration order the deportation of the killers and death squad leaders who fled, helping to lead to their prosecution. In all of this lets note some basic facts that inspired these priests to do what they did\n\n1. The example of the Biblical prophets in speaking truth to power and defending the oppressed\n2. Jesus's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount as well as his Nazareth Manifesto in Luke 4:18\n3. The Catholic Church's teaching of the Preferential Option for the Poor\n4. The Teachings of the Second Vatican Council on Human Rights.",

        "text": "So in christianity (Specially roman catholicism) there is  this concept called the \"virtuous pagan\", which basically consists of a non-christian person (Usually a pagan, but seen it being used with muslims and jews as well) who despite them not being baptized into the faith of Jesus Christ were still virtuous and good people. \n\nA good example is in the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. There he goes to hell and it is divided into different \"circles\" according to the sin people condemned to it commited, from the \"least\" sins to the \"greater\" ones. But above all circles of hell there is one in particular, called the \"limbo\". The people who are there are not really condemned or punished, the limbo is kind of a \"neutral\" place in that regard. The only punishment they recieve is never being able to see God. Here Dante shows us several examples of virtuous pagans, specially ancient greek and roman figures. Among them is peoplke such as Virgil, Homer, Euclides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle or Julius Caesar, as well as some muslims, specifically Saladin, Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd. Those are good examples of people deemed as \"virtuous pagans\" or \"virtuous non-baptized\" if we include the muslim ones.\n\nSo my question is there something equivalent in Islam? I know muslims consider shirk to be the worst of sins, but even then how would muslims classify \"virtuous\" people who were pagans, such as the ones mentioned in the Divine Comedy? This specially considering how much ancient greek philosophy influenced medieval Islam, with people such as the aforementioned Ibn Rush being a big commentator of the works of Aristotle. So what would be muslims thoughts on them?",
