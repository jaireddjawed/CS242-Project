It can help drive us to be good at our field (though in a toxic way because it\u2019s driven by a fear that if we fall behind, we lose the thing that make us valuable), but it also makes rejection very rough.\n\n>We know logically that when we get rejected from a top school in a competitive field that it means \u201cyou were a well qualified applicant, but there were too many well qualified applicants for us to take everyone,\u201d but it can feel more like \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough at the one thing you\u2019re good at and the one thing that gives you value as a human being.\u201d\n\nAgain, please share any additional resources and\/or helplines here.\n\nArchived Helpline Info:\n\nIn the US, you can call 988 for crisis support, or 1-877-GRAD-HLP for support specific to graduate students\/grad school issues.\n\nText 'HELP' to 741741 in the United States, or 686868 in Canada.\n\nAustralian folks can call 13 11 14.\n\nIn the UK, text 85258.\n\nIn Brazil, The CVV number is 188.\n\nIn India, call 022 2754 6669.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677302038.0},{"title":"first acceptance \ud83d\ude2d","author":"buckyeahice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11q1mvp\/first_acceptance\/","text":"omg after waiting for so many months waiting in limbo and checking my school's portal i finally got accepted for my school's phd psych program \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d i've been lurking a bit here + i don't really have anyone to share this joy w at the moment so :-(","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678687145.0},{"title":"My first acceptance!","author":"hemanth992","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11q099p\/my_first_acceptance\/","text":"Got admitted to PhD program at UT Dallas!

I'm not unfamiliar with academic rejection, but never have I been so completely and wholeheartedly rejected. When I applied for MAs in Fall 2020, I was accepted by a little over half and rejected by the rest \u2013\u00a0I expected that the ratio would get a little more extreme with PhDs (and 3 years after COVID started), but I didn't think I would be that unwanted. I know PhD applications are extremely competitive, especially right now given the struggles for humanities funding, but I'm still having a hard time.\n\nMy BA and my MA are in Comparative Literature (and I'm still finishing my MA), while I was applying primarily to PhDs in English and American Studies, so I'm sure that my switching fields might have to do with a little bit of it, and I'm sure that there were areas I could have improved regarding my SOP and writing sample, I don't assume that everything I did was the absolute BEST I could have POSSIBLY done - but neither were my materials for my MA applications, and I still got into a number of great programs. Which makes me think that it's the very essence of my work itself and my worth as a scholar that aren't good enough.\n\nEveryone in my life is either a very successful scholar or completely disconnected from the academic world, which makes me feel even more ashamed and alone in this \u2013\u00a0the non-academics don't seem to fully understand how much this means to me and what it feels like to be rejected in this context, and the academics have never been through this amount of rejection because they themselves are so skilled and in high demand, so their comfort feels empty and superficial, I feel like they're judging me for not being good enough regardless of what they actually say.\n\nI still have two programs left to hear from, and \"technically\" a chance at the waitlist school, but I've already been through so much disappointment that I don't want to cling to false hope. I know it's normal to need multiple cycles of applications to be accepted into a PhD program, but I have no idea what would change next time around that would actually make a difference - the only concrete change would be that I will have officially received my MA. Given my field, there's not much work I can find in the next year that will actually correspond with the skills they value in their PhD students (unlike STEM students who can do postbac research in labs), and I'm scared that having a year away from academia will cause my writing and research skills to deteriorate significantly (I have gone straight from my BA to my MA, and was hoping to go straight into my PhD from my MA). My ultimate goal is to be a professor (as I love teaching at the college level, and research and writing are my biggest passions), so going through this, I'm really struggling to believe that I'll ever be good enough to even get into a PhD program, which basically means I need to give up on my dreams. I know dealing with rejection is a really important aspect of academia, but I know so few successful academics in my field that have had to go through two cycles just to get a single acceptance, I feel like it's impossible for me to get there now.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678644991.0},{"title":"USC MS DS????","author":"themanifestingtree","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11q22f2\/usc_ms_ds\/","text":"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/11q22f2)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678688658.0},{"title":"Has anyone heard from BU Ph.D program?","author":"JohnKerouac","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11q21kh\/has_anyone_heard_from_bu_phd_program\/","text":"That's the only result I'm waiting, so I'm a bit anxious after months of waiting to heard from different universities.\n\nEdit: Linguistics program","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678688565.0},{"title":"Average students, where you at","author":"Late-Hat-9256","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11pc14a\/average_students_where_you_at\/","text":"This sub is full of people who've got exceptional profiles & have gotten into great programs in the US.\n\nI've an average profile: in terms of GPA (2.9\/4.0) and GRE (309) and close to 3 years of work experience in analytics.\n\nI've applied to MSBA\/MIS programs and didn't apply to T30 US Universities because my GPA was holding me back. \n\nLooking at all the stellar schools y'all have gotten into (I'm happy for you all) makes a little upset that I didn't aim higher.\n\nI've gotten into okay-ish schools but the risk associated with doing a master's in these schools is high because the teaching is okay-ish and these schools don't have many connections to be able to secure you with a job after completion imo, everything depends on your own effort (which I'm totally okay with)\n\nI've been pondering over this for a couple of days now,\n\nIs it worth doing a master's in average schools in the US (universities that are not IVY or next to ivy leagues)\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts,\n\nIs it worth taking a huge loan\nHow easy is it to secure a job \n\n I'm not able to process my emotions atm haha\n\nP.S\nUIC, UTD, NEU, ASU are the programs that I got admits from \n\nAlso did my research and applied to these schools based on my profile\/curriculum and job prospects (mainly location) and I am happy that I was able to secure admits.\n\nBut I've been so anxious the past few days.

People told me I wouldn\u2019t since I have this dismissal on my transcript. My question is, how the hell do I bring it up? Or explain it? I can\u2019t find any answers on google for advice and can\u2019t ask anyone I know personally due to risk of people seeing me differently.\n\nDo I bring it up?\n\nOr do I wait for them to bring it up?\n\nWhat do I say?

I was just admitted to the UMSI Masters of Science in Information program here. No financial aid info yet, but likely the only way I can afford it is by getting a GSI position.\n\nI am *very* confused about how getting a GSI position works. It seems like I have to commit to UMSI before I can apply for GSI positions, but this seems risky because I would kind of need to have one to afford to be a graduate student in the first place.\n\nI looked at current GSI positions and there are several I think I would be a good fit for, but the apps close in about 2 weeks, and I am sure my financial aid notice will not be out by then. There are currently 50% openings in QMSS (6 openings and I am a QMSS minor and have taken these classes) and CogSci 200 (I am a cog sci major) for the fall. I have been a TA in a School of Information course for 2 years, so I have teaching experience to boost my app (if there is eventually a GSI opening for this class I know I would be a great fit for that). I know the QMSS and SI profs so would reaching out to them be better?\n\nIn sum-- I am not sure what to do. Do I commit so I can apply to these positions (knowing I might have to revoke my enrollment if I cannot afford it)? Are there other things I should know about becoming a GSI?\n\nI also have read that GSI positions are not guaranteed from semester to semester, so, current gsi's-- how do you handle this uncertainty?? I can't switch back and forth between free tuition and thousands of dollars haha. I know the priority for these positions is given to PhDs so are my chances low of being able to do this? Do I have to enroll to even understand if I can afford this?\n\n**0 CommentsShareSave**","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678654692.0},{"title":"I am searching for Universities that accept low CGPA students for masters and PhD program.","author":"Substantial_Cold_372","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11ppmd0\/i_am_searching_for_universities_that_accept_low\/","text":"I have a relatively lower CGPA. 2.68 to be very specific.

Around the beginning of the fourth semester, I started to lose interest in it, so I made the decision that I needed to find a way out, but once I finished it and not before, as leaving midway was something I disliked.\n\nI always liked physics, but I never took it seriously until I got bored with engineering. So after a lot of hassle I received two internships: one in engineering and laser physics in Ukraine and another in nuclear physics at a famous government agency. \n\nI took the gre (general) and language tests to get ready for my applications for the MS in physics in the US and Europe. Got two acceptances from UK universities but was rejected by all US universities. Travelled to the UK and earned a distinction in their MSc theoretical physics. Borrowed \u00a333k in student loans to pay the tuition and support myself as there were no part-time jobs during covid times!!\n\nApplications for doctoratal programmes are a nightmare. Got rejected by every university in Canada I applied last year, and this year Chicago, USC, and Brown rejected me; Upenn, PSU, and UCSB have not responded as of yet. In any case, I don't anticipate an admission from these. I applied to my previous UK uni, and yesterday was offer holders day. To make matters worse, they never even called me for an interview. I'm still preparing for other EU applications in case I get a call for an interview. \n\nI\u2019ve lost all hope as I turned 26 last year. All of my friends are working high paying jobs in India or abroad. On the side I\u2019m preparing for doctoral entrance exam in India. This feeling of having lost and uncertainty affecting everything I do. Can\u2019t sleep properly, always sad and can\u2019t think of anything apart from wondering about how I turned into a looser. \n\nCan\u2019t figure out where it all went wrong. Was it my decision to switch to physics? How could it be when I liked physics a lot ? Was it not getting any technical job experience in industry? Only thing that\u2019s good at the moment is that I\u2019m improving my health, putting on muscle mass rapidly in the gym which seems to be a good getaway from all the misery. \n\nApologies for such a long piece.

Focus on management studies: (I like this because it's something that is required while working in tech i feel)\n3. Small cohort: (Last year's batch size was 9.

I'm not very sure how well I'll be able to pick stuff up in a year if I'm changing my career domain. To what extent will learning stuff before enrolling help? Might be too demanding health wise. \n2. Cost: it costs as much as a 2 year program. \n3. Not many people know about Cornell Tech. This can be an issue with recruiting. I don't wanna seem as a rip off. \n4. The weather in NYC is terrible. I'd like to work on the west coast. \n\n\nUCSD \nPros\n1. It's a 2 year program. Switching domains becomes easier when you learn something new for 2 years instead of 1.\n2. Proximity to silicon valley. Going to school in an area that's closer to where you want to work might be beneficial. \n3. Great weather\n4. Possible internship since \n\nCons\n1.

I am a junior in High School from Romania and I would like to apply to an undergraduate program at SciencesPo (+other universities, but this one is my top choice). Given that I only have 6 months left until the Early Admissions begin, I wanted to make sure that I use this time wisely.  \nMost of my friends apply to top schools abroad (some even Harvard) and seeing their CV has scared me a lot :). I am so so stressed out by the fact that I do not have enough activities, so I wanted to make this post to ask you whether you believe that I will be accepted and\/ or what do I have to develop in order to upper my chances.   \nAbout me: GPA 9.89\/10 (Romanian System), IELTS 8.0, and I will sit my Romanian Baccalaureate in June 2024 so there's no grade for that yet. \n\nFun-facts for the \"holistic\" approach: I know 7 alphabets (Arabic, Cyrillic, Latin, American Sign Language, Romanian Sign Language, Greek, and one invented by me 3 years ago :)). I can fluently read and write (or sign) in all of them. I self-taught myself a few things such as ASL and Romanian Sign Language (around a CEFR of A2), crocheting, Graphic Design - in Figma and Inkscape, and Programming - the basics like HTML, CSS, Python.

What of the aforementioned activities should I continue?** I am currently focusing a lot on the UNICEF one because I have just recently been named Member of County Coordinating Committee for Child Friendly Initiative. Also I stopped going to MUNs because I already have a lot of experience and I want to invest my time in sth else.  \n2. **What should I add?** What type of activities seem to be missing from my CV?  \n3. **How can I do leadership activities in my community without an NGO?** I want to do something with Opportunup because it is a true passion project that I have invested a lot of time in. We have daily posts with new opportunities and i want to also add something like donations events, but as far as I know I need an NGO to get money or donations from people, legally. The problem is I don't have the money to found an NGO so it would be a hard pass. I was thinking of webinars, but they are not of the same impact.  \n4. **I have not been a president at any association** and it is kind of late for me to do that given that I only have 6 months. I only focussed on the practical part of helping (being a volunteer, trainer, and founder of initiatives) rather than organizational (being in an executive board). **How much does this disadvantage me?**\n\n5. Any general tips and tricks for the application? Or for my civic involvement? Anything is useful as I am really stressed out. It would be a gigantic leap for my family and for my education, that is why I want to push even harder.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678650466.0},{"title":"Columbia MSCS Decisions?","author":"SongImmediate6777","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11pnpfs\/columbia_mscs_decisions\/","text":"I\u2019ve seen a few people on here \/ grad cafe get results but not a lot.

I'm taking Calculus II (100-level course) and Experimental Design and Analysis (300-level course) with the math & stats department after having graduated a couple of years ago. My school is not great. My calculus professor practically offered me a research position here for an MS in mathematics, and thinking she was just spitballing, I just said what was on my mind and probably offended her. I apologized later, and she then suggested doing an MS sort of as a gateway to cover prerequisites if I wanted to do biostatistics, but my stats class is going abysmally and I don't want to stay here for two years. How can I go about asking for a letter for a different institution?\n\nDetails:\n\nTo emphasize misconduct at my university, here are a few situations I encountered during undergrad. One professor insinuated I was trying to be a homewrecker when I was asking for help during office hours, another made fun of an autistic kid by saying \"Hey guy, wait till we get to the chapter on microdeletions, and maybe we'll figure out what's wrong with you\" and commented on a girl's butt as she was walking up the stairs: \"I'd say something about that view but I'd get fired,\" and one professor got title IX'd a half dozen times but recently was awarded tenure. I'm glad that my instructors this year are women, but that doesn't mean everything is perfect, and I really want to get out of here.\n\nI absolutely cannot ask my stats instructor because she thought I copied my homework assignment (I didn't, and suggested running it through a plagiarism checker). Later, after sending a review guide for the exam which she stated would be over the first three chapters, she instead tested everyone over chapter 4. I didn't ask her any questions during the exam unlike my classmates who essentially just asked for the answers and just turned in an essentially blank paper. She's now talking to me like I'm mentally challenged when I scored in the 97th percentile in math on the ACT and the average score at this school is about 21. The rest of the class agrees that she is not a good instructor and I know to take RateMyProfessor with a grain of salt but an 11% approval rating has got to mean something.\n\nI'm performing at the top of my class in calculus II, though, despite not taking calc I since high school. Unfortunately when I was trying to talk to my calculus professor about applying for graduate programs one day, she asked about doing an MS in math at this institution. I was half-asleep and didn't realize what she was getting at, and not knowing this was basically an offer, I said something like \"No, I want to go to a good school,\" and talked about not wanting to attend a degree mill...\n\nI think the number of professors who've acted out during class (like explicit sexual harassment because they know they won't get fired for it, or openly mocking disabled students), or said their research doesn't matter, or telling people never to go into academia, made me assume that faculty universally hated their jobs here, especially if they went to a name-brand school. Like I have actually trash-talked professors here with other faculty within and outside of this university and they were pretty real about it. But my calculus professor (who went to Notre Dame) looked pretty pissed.\n\nA couple of days later, when I realized what I'd done, I apologized for being dismissive, and she said \"No, it's me who was dismissive, you said you wanted to do public health,\" but I think she's just very civil.\n\nI really, really need a letter from her. Can I still ask for one? I just have had so many unpleasant experiences with professors that I wonder if the letter will end up hurting me  :(","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678647937.0},{"title":"Accepting Admission Despite Most Likely Not Attending","author":"spanishphysics","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11pgxmi\/accepting_admission_despite_most_likely_not\/","text":"Curious on your thoughts on this predicament I find myself in.

But the tuition is a little expensive.\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati is kind of known for its co-op and I simply can't ignore the amazing scholarship now more than ever due to the rising dollar prices, recession\/layoffs, etc. Also, I think the cost of living is on the lower side.

One of those is whether to go back to school for a masters or an mba. I figured someone here may have some insight into which one I should do. Before I get into it, I just want to say that finances are an issue for me so I am looking for preferably the cheapest way to do this. That being said: \n \nI have been applying to jobs for a while now and having no luck landing even an interview. Every job posting I see recently for companies I\u2019m interested in lists like 5-10 years of experience in industry plus all of these technical skills with different programs. I am considering a return to college to combat this. I am thinking I\u2019d either go for an MS in economics with the goal of pivoting into analyst type roles later, or I keep grinding the job market and work for a few more years and go back for my MBA with the goal of getting into financial consulting. I\u2019m not sure which of these I should do. \n\nI recently had a stroke of good luck and got ~80% of my original bachelors degree loans paid off but I would likely go back to CC first to take my math pre-reqs and some refreshers on basic stuff before enrolling for a masters. I would also probably have to spend money on GRE\/ GMAT prep for masters admissions, and application fees. So add all of that up and it would be a lot plus tuition for the 2 year degree. \n\nI was also considering potentially getting the MS now and working for a while in a role after the MS and then still going back to get my MBA later but I\u2019m not sure that would be worth it because it would be even more money and it would drag on pretty late into my career. \n\nI was wondering what kind of advice anyone here might have for me in this situation.

I got a TAship at Georgia Tech, meaning I have to pay 20k in tuition, which is 75k at NYU (72k at Columbia). NYU is also four semesters long (three for Columbia), so the living expense in NYC will add up. However, I feel like the Data Science program is better than MSA regarding career prospects and academics. It's also the better fit for me because I want to work in tech as a data scientist\/data engineer, and I'm not averse to software roles either. I don't want roles involving business input, and the MSA program does cater to that to a good extent.\n\nI can't ignore the money, though, so does anyone have good\/bad points about either program which are relevant? I have a couple of questions that can help me make my decision\n\n1. How easy is it to get TA\/RA positions at NYU\/Columbia, and what is the stipend\/tuition waiver if any?\n2. Would NYU\/Columbia be massively better for landing jobs in NYC compared to GaTech? Does the location actually factor in that heavily through career fairs? I heard from an MSA grad that most of the companies at GaTech career fairs are from Atlanta.\n3. Is it possible to accelerate a degree at NYU, making it possible with less tuition overall? Some colleges have the same tuition rates above a certain threshold of credits hence the question.  \n\n\nBasically, paying around 60k more while studying is going to compromise my life for the next 3 years, is the degree at NYU\/Columbia worth that compromise? Any thoughts people might have are massively welcome, I'm leaning towards GaTech for the money alone. It's an awesome program in its own right and a good fit for me, but not the perfect one.

My main major is environmental science, for which I have a good GPA and a pretty fair amount of research experience (including a research paper published in a respected journal), and I mainly applied to environmental science\/engineering master's\/PhD programs.\n\nDuring my studies, I double majored in a foreign language, and went quite deep in this field as well. I tried my best to tie my decision to learn a foreign language with my interest in environmental science in my SOPs, but at the end of the day, I'm a bit worried some schools may view this as lacking complete focus. Moreover, I intensively took environmental science courses during my first two years, but once I was done with my required courses, I focused on my foreign language studies (although I still engaged in environmental science research outside of class). Would some admissions councils not like seeing on my transcripts that I abruptly went from taking courses on wastewater treatment one semester to ones on grammar and culture the next?\n\nIf I do not end up going to a school this year, I was considering spending time studying to pass my country's environmental engineer's licensing exam, to \"prove\" that I am indeed skilled in this field even if I did not continuously learn it in the classroom, and then reapplying this fall after graduating.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Could learning too many things outside of one's main major in undergrad be a minus in admissions?

As an international student, I have been taking care of myself since 2019 and have had to work part-time as a server to pay for college and living expenses. While this job may not be relevant experience, it has taught me a lot as a person. Despite the constricted time between work and classes, I have maintained a GPA of 3.95, which may drop a few points by the time I am done.\n\nI am looking to continue my education by pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at a top-tier university like UT Austin, Georgia Tech, University of Washington, among others. However, I have been rejected in more than 100 applications for SWE internships due to a lack of side projects, and research opportunities with CS faculty at FSU have also been difficult to come by.\n\nRecently, I was offered an opportunity to work with chemistry scientists at the MagLab in Tallahassee, a prestigious laboratory worldwide. While the work is basic data handling in Python, they offer many benefits, including good hourly pay, which will allow me to quit my job as a server and tutor, and a lot of support for my education. However, I am unsure if this research will be relevant to improve my resume and help me get into a top-tier grad school. While it may be better than serving experience, it is not a CS research, and I won't be doing much. On the other hand, I could apply again for some research with the CS faculty, and I am confident that I could get something, but I wouldn't get many benefits.\n\nI am torn between taking the MagLab opportunity or looking for CS research. While I am pretty sure I could get a research position with the CS faculty, I won't get much help from them, and they are known for just changing the name on a recommendation letter template they have. The MagLab, on the other hand, makes a lot of emphasis on wanting me to thrive and help me with my education. They are willing to help me a lot, and I see they care about me as a human being.\n\nI am seeking advice on what to do. Should I look for a CS research position, or should I take the MagLab opportunity? Which one will give me better chances of getting into a top-tier school? I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to help you understand the situation. Thank you in advance for your help\n\nPD: I want to focus my MS in ML, so thats why i think data handling in python could be somewhat relevant, since I have been trying to train myself on Data Science (From what I understand, it is a good way to start my path in ML)","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678558128.0},{"title":"please who know about South Dakota state university.

Tuition cost: \n  - CMU: Will have to pay 3 semesters of fees (about $27-28K per sem), no tuition waiver, but wages from RA\/TAship can cover living expenses. I've also heard that summer internships\/job can help repay the loan taken.\n  - Stanford: After the first semester, CS students usually get a TAship along with a fee waiver.\n2. PhD opportunities: \n  - CMU: Coursework for ML PhD at CMU is same as that for MSML, so I would only have to do 1-2 extra courses in my PhD. This means that my PhD can conclude 1-1.5 years earlier. I can also apply to other schools.\n  - Stanford: As Stanford views their MSCS program to be an industry-oriented one, the selection for CS PhD is not that probable. However, I can apply to other schools.\n3. Curriculum:\n  - CMU: MSML is very ML-oriented (which I like), but a little rigid (which I don't mind). The courses are math-heavy and theoretical, which I think I'll enjoy. Semester system.\n  - Stanford: I'll have to take some non-ML courses too.

It\u2019s the exact kind of research I want, the national lab collaborations are already present (I have always been interested in collaborating with a national lab during my time in grad school because it\u2019s what I did in undergrad), the facilities and equipment are way better suited to handle radioactive materials (my research is in radiochemistry), 100% externally funded, the weather is a lot nicer, feels like home, I clicked super well with the current graduate students (unlike some of my other visits), classes are a lot better, no TAing required!\n\nBUT\n\nThe PIs are rather hands-off and I am a very hands-on student\/researcher. Because of this, my current PI told me she could not in good conscience recommend or encourage me to go there. I had a bad experience with a hands-off PI before so she said she thought I\u2019d do better in an environment with research that\u2019s not exactly what I wanted with a very hands-on PI rather than a hands-off environment with perfect research. It\u2019s a small field where everyone knows everyone so 4 other people I\u2019ve worked with\/talked to that know the PIs at this school agreed with her.\n\nI would normally agree but the other students said they help each other out a lot and that they\u2019re closer than the average research group. They said yeah it\u2019s hands-off but it just takes a while to get warmed up to it. They said it\u2019s a really collaborative environment so other professors are around if they really need help and they all help each other out with each others projects. None of the current graduate students described it as awful or undoable and they all seemed relatively happy.\n\nThe school also has a fantastic admin, which doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal but she keeps track of everyones funding and fellowships and makes sure everyone always has what they need and that everyone is getting paid no matter what. She handles literally everything so the professors don\u2019t have to worry about anything but the technical stuff and she's also someone that the students go to for support.\n\nWhat would you do?

I applied for three, but I am abandoning hope for the last one since I have yet to get any interview requests or responses from this university.\n\nI put my high hopes on the specific university in which I got to have an opportunity for an interview. However, I got rejected because there was a better candidate for the funding she applied to.\n\nMy field is vertebrate paleontology. Therefore, the pool is very small. Furthermore, my country (South Korea) only has two vertebrate paleontologists and they are really close to retirement. Thus, I need to move overseas for opportunities.\n\nEven though I want to try the next year again, I am afraid of applying to the Ph.D. program, especially, in the USA since, everywhere I go, the competition is fierce, and I do not feel competent enough.\n\nI think like my weak point is two-fold:\n\n(1) Lack of publication: even though I finished my master's program, I haven't published (or submitted) my work in an online journal, yet. The publication was delayed since, after defending my thesis, my supervisor wanted to change the methodology section since he felt it needed to be more objective. Thus, I had to find another methodology, do the experiment again, and write methods, results, and part of the discussion section again.\n\nIt was honestly frustrating because my supervisor has an ulterior motive behind this study and I need to prove his point despite it is not accepted by the majority of the field (and I am still a Master's student).\n\n(2) Low undergraduate GPA: my undergraduate GPA is 2.94 over 4. It is less than 3.0 and it is grabbing my ankle for application. Even though my master's GPA is 3.95 over 4, still it feels not good enough.\n\nSo my plan is to finish submitting the paper I am working on right now, ask my supervisor for another research material (which he allowed me to work on for the future), and try to find programs for next year.\n\nI have suffered from chronic IBS for a long time (since 2013) so it is difficult to focus on studying from time to time but I do want to study paleontology for life and rejection from the starting point is just utterly frustrating.\n\nSo I am asking... what should I do from now?\n\nI know I can cry for now but I have a future to move on to.\n\nI am waiting for your advice and thank you for reading this long post.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678460722.0},{"title":"Has anyone here ever applied to an online Masters program?","author":"sunseasandwich","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11o0k4w\/has_anyone_here_ever_applied_to_an_online_masters\/","text":"If so, what was the turnaround time for a decision?

I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two. For some context, two of the programs were safety schools and the third was a dream school, but no funding at all and based in NYC it would have been financially irresponsible. So my two choices are Wash U in St Louie and VCU in Richmond, VA. Wash U offered full tuition and a $45k yearly stipend and a $1.5K yearly research stipend as well as other perks with the fellowship they offered me, which is mostly for terminal degrees and is highly competitive. VCU offered full tuition and a TAship stipend of $10k per year. To preface, both programs are fantastic with very supportive faculty, however offer very different environments and perspectives. VCU has been my top pick for close to a decade. Not only for their facilities, but also their expansive approach to sculpture. In fact they have been ranked the #1 sculpture program in the country for close to a decade if not more. Wash U being a wealthy private school has stunning facilities, but presents a more structured environment and is less prestigious, ranked about #23 versus VCU #4 after UCLA, Yale, and SAIC. I\u2019ve know people who have gone to both programs and have enjoyed their time there. I come from a modest state school with a BFA in Sculpture and a BA in Psychology, so I feel very fortunate to have these offers.

Everyone around me is flourishing, enjoying, getting promoted and here I am, unsure of where I'll be in a month even.\n\nI'll turn 25 this year so I won't even be reapplying because it'll be too late to start MS at 26 and it won't make much sense to me.\n\nWith every passing day and no inbox updates, I've started getting really negative and self-doubting thoughts which is scaring me. Every time I think luck will be on my side and I'll finally catch a break, I'm proved wrong. I know how much of a struggle it was to submit these applications alongside an extremely hectic job- I barely left my room for 3 months and to think that it was all in vain.\n\nI tried talking to people in my circle but since nobody is in my situation, they don't seem to get it and whatever they say isn't helping me. I know it's a long rant, but I'm just hoping to see if there's someone in a similar situation.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThis is my list of universities and profile before anyone asks:\n\nUniversities:\nUIUC, Yale, UMich, Purdue WL, UCLA, USC, UPenn, NYU Tandon, UMass, UMD, GaTech\n\nProfile:\n\nWork Ex: almost 2 years at a MAANG company, 9 months at one of the biggest FinTech firms, 3 internships at a startup and 2 MNCs.\nGPA: 8.38\/10 (not great I know, but I have A+\/A's on almost all of the CS subjects like OS, CN, DBMS).\nOthers: 3 projects in domains like ML\/DS\/SWE, 3 TAships in Computer Programming, Computer Networking and Database courses, leadership positions in college and mentoring positions at office.\n\nGRE: 323(Q:163, V:160, AWA:4)- Not that great I know but a lot of the universities aren't even considering GRE.\n\nTOEFL: 120\/120\n\nLOR: 2 LORs from college profs who were really fond of me and who I've done projects and courses under, 1 from my older manager at my most recent org (he also wrote a strong LOR)\nSOP: Had it reviewed by several people(MS students, PhD students and one college senior who is a prof at a good university in the US) and everyone said it was a strong SOP with good chances of admit.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678347186.0},{"title":"Funding UMich SEAS","author":"Low-Ad-1305","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11n2mo7\/funding_umich_seas\/","text":"Hi!!

What's the point of them advertising they have xyz program and tell you to come apply when they already get hundreds of thousands of applications for every major.\n\nAnyone who is looking for a degree, would have already down their own home work and would apply anyways if they thought they would be a good fit so what is the point of the ad? \n\nI feel like targeted ads make zero sense in the first place because you get targeted for them... After you've already searched for a specific term. So there is a high chance before you start getting served by these ads, you already finished your research and made a decision. \n\nAnd then the other side of it is that you get served ads by whoever pays more for that ad spot to be served to you which is going to be whoever has more money. So obviously top universities have more money to spend on ads so you'll see their ads more which is pointless because you already know which universities those are. But lower ranked schools who could actually maybe benefit from running ads and advertising their programs and school to people who don't have them on their radar because people don't know about the school or whatever, don't have the money for ads or just simply don't do it for whatever reason.\n\nAnd also these universities are looking for top talent, and again if you are already an excellent candidate these universities look for, these candidates already know about these schools and an ad won't give them any new information or sway their decision to apply to which program.\n\nThe same issue I feel like is also with companies running ads for job openings... Like how does that make sense. Like in which universe am I not aware that Google exists and has employees so therefore they must have jobs I can apply to if I'm a good fit and am looking for a job? What's the point of them running job ads? Once again smaller, unknown enteties would benefit more from running job ads because people don't wake up in the morning knowing their business exists on the plant, unlike Google, but they aren't doing that cus they don't have money to waste.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678355950.0},{"title":"JHU MS in DS decisions?","author":"ComfortableFirst_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11mqk3z\/jhu_ms_in_ds_decisions\/","text":"Any idea when JHU will be releasing their decisions for MSDS program?

I just got offers for 3 grad programs last week that I never thought I had a chance at.\n\n* Teacher\u2019s College: M.A. in Higher and Postsecondary Education ($15k scholarship)\n* University of Pennsylvania: M.S.Ed. in Higher Education ($25k scholarship)\n* Harvard GSE: M.Ed. in Human Development and Education (financial aid package pending)\n\nOther programs I applied to:\n\n* USC: M.Ed. in Educational Counseling (accepted)\n* NYU: M.A. in Higher Education Student Affairs (awaiting decision)\n* UCLA: M.Ed. in Student Affairs (waitlisted)\n\nTo be honest, reality hasn\u2019t even hit yet\u2014me, a first gen low-income student getting into 3 Ivy League grad programs? The me from a year wouldn\u2019t believe it at all. Even though I should be celebrating and proud of all of these acceptances, it scares me that I don\u2019t really know what to do to be honest.\n\nSome background info:\n\n* currently finishing undergrad program (majors: Education and Psych)\n* no plans to pursue Phd\n* end goal is to work in **student affairs**, currently interested in **academic advising**. done a bit of high school outreach and academic advising during undergrad and absolutely love it\n* wants to move out of state for a new experience (did all K-16 in California), but move to New York or back to California for long-term work\n\nLike I said, I had no expectations of getting into any of these schools. I would be fine with going to any of them! But when I saw my mom crying when she first heard the Harvard acceptance, I was almost 90% sure that was where I was going to go (in the moment). Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m not too sure if the program is the best fit for what I want to do. Of course, I did do intensive research about the program and the curriculum and all of the courses look interesting and are sort of an extension of what I studied in undergrad (which I absolutely love!), but I\u2019m not sure if a Master\u2019s degree in Human Development in Education is the best option for someone who\u2019s interested in higher ed student affairs. The program at Harvard does allow their students to choose a concentration in Higher Education, but I heard from a current student that the concentration courses make up a small part of the whole curriculum (aka you won\u2019t really learn much about Higher Ed).\n\nNow, I understand that prestige and rankings shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the top of the list of factors for choosing a grad school, but it\u2019s a little hard when everyone around you is hoping that you\u2019ll go to an Ivy school. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way, because how many people can say they graduated from Harvard? Point is, I absolutely understand that the name of the school shouldn\u2019t be a major deciding factor but rather the program, but it\u2019s just a little hard to accept that.\n\nI\u2019m still currently reaching to students from Penn and TC about their experience, but I would love it if anyone could put in their two cents.\n\n(tldr; trying to choose between balance and fit of programs)","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678327578.0},{"title":"Got into Cornell MAE!!!!","author":"Material_God","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11mbckf\/got_into_cornell_mae\/","text":"But is master in MechE in Cornell better than offer in UIUC?

I may or may not try once more in an application cycle in the future. I'm trying to look into reasons for this application season not working out for me. If I find any reasons that I can't change, then I'm just going to give up on further studies. \n\nI do have accumulated graduate degrees in my lifetime. I have three masters degrees. I didn't plan these degrees, but they just happened. I used to wonder if it was good or bad. However, I have now accepted what it is, and I don't look at them as an education, but I look at them as exposure. I learned so much from my life experiences In going to different countries and cities and meeting people from different cultures.\n\nIn addition, I also spent two years in a fully funded Ph.D. program. I couldn't continue because I wasn't able to clear the written comprehensive exam. I understand my role in this, but the pandemic also was at least a bit responsible. Two students left the program just a couple of months before this written comps. That was the start of my downfall. However, after learning about my termination, I was given two choices: 1) leave the program and go home, or 2) stay for three more months and complete the coursework. I chose the latter option, and I completed my two years of coursework. I'm grateful for my university to provide me with an opportunity to stay and complete the coursework. I got to learn a lot from them. \n\nStudying is my passion, and that's why I applied to about seven PhD programs this year. I had shared my above story with them, and they seemed fine with it. Hence, that can't be the reason for my rejections. I'm just trying to request them for feedback to at least know if my reason for rejection is 1) something that I can change orglad t something that I can't change. \n(\nIn my heart, I sincerely hope that it's (2) because then I can accept that I am never going to get a PhD and move on with my life. I don't know how I will react if someone gives me a reason in the (1) category. \n\nAnyhoo, the game is going to end for me soon. I don't feel that bad for loosing the game, but I feel bad for not doing anything else while waiting. I did had a good plan b, but I didn't work on that plan b while waiting. \n\nCan anyone please suggest how can I soothe my mind for feeling bad for not working on a plan b from January to March. I took my GMAT in December and my GRE retake in January start. Hence, even though I wasn't able to get my desired score, I was at least doing something. However, I just went into full on waiting mode from mid January to now in March. All my applications were due on Jan 15. \n\nIf anyone can share any thoughts that could be any comfort to me, then that would be great. I'm glad to have found this subreddit, and I hope to stay in touch with you all!

Unfortunately the rest of them won\u2019t get back to me till about April.\n\nWould it look bad if I were to place a deposit for the March 24th school then potentially withdraw if I were to choose admission at another program? I know that I\u2019d forfeit the money which I am okay with, I\u2019m just scared of cutting ties or ruining any relationships with the first school.\n\nWould appreciate any advice!!

I'm STOKED about these acceptances, but I do not know which institution will be the best decision for me as I move forward in my academic career.\n\nFor a background, I am:  \n\\- Low-income (no $ to finance grad school outside of merit\/state scholarships -- and I am OOS for both institutions)  \n\\-Pursuing academia, probably in comparative literature or history  \n\\-The first in my family to attend graduate school, so I REALLY don't know the ropes\n\nI applied to the FLAS at both institutions and should be hearing back from both with decisions soon.

For Columbia, I can only receive full funding for one year, after which I'd be paying out-of-pocket. That said, I took a few grad seminars at my undergraduate college, so I might have transferable credits.\n\nI should also add that, while I am not picky about location, I am looking to leave what was a terrible support environment at my bachelor's institution. I was in an urban school with a bad reputation for student mental health. My advisors would also take weeks to get back to me whenever I had important and time-sensitive questions. A lack of timely communication forced me to take an extra semester of college where I didn't know of the funding status until the week before classes. I really want to see if I can find a more supportive environment wherever I end up next.\n\nI think that, future career investments aside, I'm leaning towards UMich because they've been highly responsive and friendly to me, whereas it took me 2 months to get a return phone call from Columbia. That said, I am keenly aware of how competitive it is to get TT faculty positions, so I want to set myself up with my best shot of producing high-quality research, making several university connections, and getting into a top PhD program (currently eyeing Columbia, Harvard, UMich, Penn, Berkeley, Chicago, etc.).\n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated.

I am working in real-time computer graphics and i want to get deeper in the mathematical sense of my field later in my career (cg research, optimization etc.) or even head into another field, academia is a choice too. Differential geometry is a topic that interests me (from my amateur point of view at least).\n\nHaving a cs background with the usual applied curriculum: calc 1-3, linear algebra, discrete math, numerical analysis, fourier transforms, number theory (pure), cryptography, graph theory, now i spend my free time learning the pure side of maths and it makes sense to me that if i want to follow a path of research or relevant, i think it better suits me a master degree in pure mathematics. \n\nI am intrested in programs in Europe. However, most of the programs only accept graduates from math degrees and some specifically point out not to send an application if the background is engineering, computer science or finance etc. . How do i deal with that? People suggest that GRE math exams won't suffice and its a waste of time and there are some courses online with certificates but obviously are not considered proof. \n\nHow do i approach applications out of my reach? Should i apply nevertheless, make my case and whatever happens? Is there any way to prove my time studying for grad school? I have no connections (to help publish a paper lets say) on the pure math world.

I would have to do one year of the masters at university of michigan and IF accepted to Yale, change schools. \n\nI am not interested in transfering, since they are fairly different programs and I would probably not mention it in my CV. I'm only worried of the possibility that Yale somehow finds out out I am enrolled in other school and maybe that will hinder my chances to get accepted in my reapplication. Or that University of Michigan is legally required to give out that information. I couldn't find information online. \n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678306018.0},{"title":"NEU PhD psychology decision status 2023","author":"youngblood2561","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11m01le\/neu_phd_psychology_decision_status_2023\/","text":"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/11m01le)","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678291238.0},{"title":"UCSD vs UCLA vs Georgia Tech for MS CS","author":"archiescomic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11lpi03\/ucsd_vs_ucla_vs_georgia_tech_for_ms_cs\/","text":"Haven't actually gotten into ucla or gtech, just a hypothetical question.

I will be attending <T10 school> this fall. Because I went through the PhD admissions process, some of this advice will be more geared towards those doing the same as opposed to those going through the MS admissions process, but most if it is applicable to both groups. Also, I\u2019ve never served on an admissions committee, I just wanted to offer my perspective on this process as someone who has gone through it as an applicant.\n\n# My Most Important Advice\n\nI believe the best way to understand the admissions process as a prospective student is just to surround yourself with people who are talking about it. When I was preparing to apply, I read a decent amount of literature out there, but I later found that the knowledge I gained from that was at best incomplete and at worst inaccurate.\n\nI joined a discord server focused on graduate admissions. I can't post the link here, but look around a little and I'm sure you'll find it. Once applications were submitted and the waiting period began, I began actively reading the discussion there. I learned so much from the discussion there.\n\nI imagine for most of you it is probably too late to do this, but if I could do it over again I would go about educating myself on the admissions process is by joining this server the year before (or maybe even two years before) I planned on applying. That way I go into the application season really having a good intuition for the admissions space. I myself only gained this intuition during the waiting period, when it is mostly useless.\n\n# MS or PhD\n\nFor some people the answer to this is obvious. For me, it was basically a coin flip. I\u2019ve heard that getting a MS is probably a better financial move if you want to go in to industry. But for some cool fancy research jobs you\u2019ll need the PhD.\n\nIf you are set on going for a faculty position then obviously you should pick PhD. That being said, you should look into the statistics for your prospective university\u2019s faculty placement. In short, they will be dire unless it is a top school. So just keep your expectations in check in that regard. I\u2019m still quite unsure about whether I want to go this route.\n\nAnother factor for me that maybe is a little silly is just the idea of going into debt. I might have had to take out a little dept to do a MS (honestly probably not even). I just generally prefer the idea of having my school paid for, even if its a worse financial decision overall. I sort of wish I had finessed some kind of industry job where they agreed to pay for my MS.\n\nThe final major factor I considered was just the length of the program. 4-5 years is a long time, and a big commitment. A big reason I wanted to go to grad school in the first place is that I just like school. But do I really want 4-5 more years of it? Or would 2 be plenty?\n\nI ended up going the PhD route but I\u2019m still not really sure if that is what was best for me.\n\n# Program Selection\n\nThe manor in which I selected the programs I applied to was borderline random. I pretty much just evaluated my own profile and applied to twelve schools where I thought I would most likely be rejected. However I considered the odds that I would get into at least one program I applied to to be very high.\n\nEven in my very basic dumb methodology for program selection, I failed. I very much hate the idea of waiting another cycle. I don\u2019t want to go into industry yet. As such, I should have applied to a selection of schools that were extremely unlikely to all reject me. However, my evaluation of my own profile was faulty, so I left myself very vulnerable to this possibility. I had one extremely stressful depressing week where I was almost certain that I would not be receiving any PhD admits. Thankfully at the end of that week I was accepted into two programs. However, that miserable week had me really wishing that I had been smarter about my program selection.\n\nCommon wisdom says that (for PhD) you should apply to schools mainly by assessing whether they have a specific professor that you are interested in working with. This makes a lot of sense because day-to-day your experience during your PhD will be much more about working in the lab than it is about the prestige of the school.\n\nHowever, I feel like you can really only make an informed decision about which advisor you want to work with if you\u2019ve got a very good idea about the kinds of projects you want to work on, and for me that just wasn\u2019t the case. I had a decent amount of undergraduate research work, but very little focus in any one specific field. When I researched PIs, I found an overwhelming amount of them who had projects that sounded interesting to me, making it hard to narrow down based on PI. So I ended up applying to schools based mostly on the prestige of their computer science PhD program.\n\nMy advice is to do as much focused research as you can as an undergrad. Try not to change field too much, you want to try and become as experienced as possible in one field. If you succeed in becoming an expert in something, then you should seek out professors who work closely with what you\u2019ve committed your undergrad to researching. This will give you a huge leg up. \u201cResearch fit\u201d is so important, and the rare candidate who actually has more than a surface level experience in a professors\u2019 field will have a huge leg up.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done much research, or you\u2019re like me and you\u2019ve been a little too broad in choosing research topics, then I don\u2019t see anything wrong with letting \u201cresearch fit\u201d take a back seat in your program selection process.\n\n# How many schools should I apply to?\n\nA bunch. The PhD admissions process is really noisy, so prioritize applying to a bunch of programs instead of painstakingly making sure your application is perfect for a small handful. I applied to 12 programs thinking that was a lot. Now I feel like thats only a little above average. Apply to like 20 schools you\u2019re slightly underqualified for and one of them will almost certainly end up accepting you. If you\u2019ve got a lot of research experience in one specific area and you\u2019re really only interested in working with 6 professors in the world who are doing the same stuff, maybe this doesn\u2019t really apply to you.\n\nApplying to so many schools is pretty expensive, but this is the rest of your life we\u2019re talking about. The application fees are worth it. The only real limiting factor here is that you can\u2019t be torturing your letter writers by making them send out letters to 50 schools. If you really wanna get crazy you could recruit like 9 letter writers and divide their workload evenly, but thats kind of weird and you\u2019re obviously going to get lower quality letters from your 7th 8th and 9th choice letter writers.\n\nMost people will tell you the opposite advice. They\u2019ll say. \u201cOh yeah just pour your heart and soul into like three applications and they will recognize your effort and accept you.\u201d Don\u2019t listen to them! I am right!\n\n# What Aspects of an Application are Most Important?\n\nThis section in particular would certainly be more accurately answered by someone with an admissions perspective rather than an applicant perspective, but I still have some thoughts that I\u2019d like to share.\n\nI feel like I had a fantastic GRE score, a terrible SOP, a pretty bad undergrad institution, average\/amazing LORs depending on the school, a fantastic GPA, and sort of average research experience. Add all that up and apply to a bunch of highly ranked schools and you get mostly rejects with a few acceptances sprinkled in. Here is how big of a role I think each component played in that equation, ordered from least important to most important.\n\n**6 GRE:**\n\nEveryone will tell you that these days the GRE is pretty unimportant for grad admissions, and I believe them. More and more schools are making the GRE optional or phasing it out entirely. It feels to me like roughly 15% of schools require the GRE, 75% allow optional submission of the GRE, and 10% do not allow GRE scores to be submitted\n\nI took the test anyway. I knew I would be able to get a good score, which would bolster (even if only slightly) my application to schools that allow optional submission of GRE scores. Another factor that made me decide to take it was that I did not know which schools I wanted to apply to yet, so I wanted to keep the option open to apply schools that required it. I\u2019m like 60% sure that the school I will ultimately attend required me to submit a GRE score. On top of it all, I think preparing for and taking aptitude tests is pretty fun, even if they\u2019re immoral or bad predictors or whatever.\n\nThe downsides of taking the test are clear. It is a major time investment to study leading up to the exam. I didn\u2019t spend anything during my preparation, but if you\u2019re a pay for test prep kind of person that can be expensive. Even if you\u2019re frugal like me, paying to take the test and send it to all the schools you apply to is still expensive. And in all likelihood it is a largely unimportant part of your application. If you\u2019re the type who hates or is stressed out by tests like these, don\u2019t feel too bad about skipping the GRE.\n\n**5 SOP:**\n\nI really didn\u2019t put much effort into my SOP. That is just because I was stressed out and lazy. Unlike the GRE, I don\u2019t feel writing a good SOP is something that you are justified in blowing off.\n\nThat being said, I have a hard time believing that admissions committees are turning down candidates with a more impressive CV in favor of someone who spent more time learning the to replicate the formula for how to write a good SOP. It just doesn\u2019t seem like a good way of separating candidates who will actually do well in grad school to me. Maybe it helps weed out some absolute red flags.\n\nMy SOP was basically me describing a bunch of research I\u2019ve done and then for each school I wrote one little paragraph at the end where I weakly justified why I wanted to go to that school specifically. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to do that. My SOP was better than the ones that are all \u201cEver since I was 6 I knew I loved computers\u201d, but I\u2019m pretty sure my SOP didn\u2019t win me any points with the admissions committees.\n\nThere are SOP guides out there and lots of examples of gold SOPs, so you should invest the time in actually writing a good SOP. I feel like there is a pretty low upper limit of how good an SOP can be, so its worth putting in the effort to hit that.\n\n**4 Undergrad Institution:**\n\nPeople love saying this doesn\u2019t matter at all, but it certainly does. Just look at any highly competitive program and see where its students come from. A good part of that is certainly selection bias, but there is no way an admissions committee is just going to overlook the fact that your 4.0 GPA is from Cornell instead of the University of South Dakota.\n\nSo if somehow you are a highschooler and you are reading this, try getting into a good school lol. For the other 99% of you, there\u2019s really no point in worrying about this at this point. Just focus on the other parts of your application.\n\n**3 LORs:**\n\nI\u2019m ranking LORs so high because of the influence that having a LOR from a well connected professor can have. Most of my LORs basically felt like filler LORs that probably didn\u2019t really strengthen or hurt my application. But some LORs I could tell probably made a huge difference.\n\n**2 GPA:**\n\nOk, these top two are close reflections of how you actually spent your time during your four years as an undergrad. As such, they are good indicators of how productive you will be as a grad student. So its no wonder admissions committees look at these so closely.\n\nI definitely spent more time worrying about my GPA than I did about research experience. I have some regrets about this, but I would be very wary about letting your GPA slip to focus on research. Coming from a no name undergraduate institution, I always felt like I needed the perfect 4.0 for competitive grad schools to take me seriously. I actually kind of still think this is the case. If you go to a decent undergrad, maybe you\u2019ve got a little more wiggle room in this department.\n\nWhen I started majoring in Computer Science I was really motivated to do well in my classes, but not really motivated to work on side projects or study leetcode. The fact that what I enjoyed working hard on aligned more with the goals of someone who wanted to attend grad school than someone who wanted to be a software engineer certainly had an influence on my decision to continue my education instead of entering the workforce. I think most people will tell you this way of thinking is backwards and will make you sad, but I actually think its fine. If you enjoyed reading this paragraph, you should read \u201cDon\u2019t Follow Your Passion\u201d by Cal Newport.\n\n**1 Research Experience:**\n\nThis, of course, is the big one. Research is what you\u2019re going to spend your time doing during your PhD, so a demonstrated ability to do well in this area is important. Additionally, a really great research fit with a specific professor will make them likely to stick their neck out and vouch for you.\n\nLike I said earlier, you shouldn\u2019t go so hard on research that you neglect your classes and end up with a mediocre GPA. Keep up that great GPA and try to publish something along the way. Don\u2019t just tank your GPA into mediocrity and hope to bank a really profound paper to win over admissions committees. That will stress me out. Lowkey I feel like if you have below a 3.5, competitive programs are going to need something exceptional to save your application. And if they open your application and they see \u201cGPA: 2.X\u201d they will just instantly shred it.\n\nI never got any publications during my undergrad. Secretly I actually had a couple opportunities to do so if I was a little less lazy. Even so, I\u2019ve basically been doing research of some kind for my entire undergraduate career. Even without publications, having something to talk about research wise at least kept my application afloat so that I could win over admissions committees with my other assets. I feel like if you have literally no research experience at all, even just filling all the boxes on an application would be really difficult.\n\n# Should you reach out to Faculty?\n\nA common piece of advice you see a lot is that during the application process, you should reach out to faculty members you are interested in working with. But how exactly is an applicant supposed to go about doing this?\n\nOnce during a lecture one of my professors went on a very hateful rant about prospective grad students who cold email him with a generic \u201cHey, I\u2019m interested in working with you\u201d instead of something like \u201cHey, I read xyz paper and am really interested in your field and working on such and such project\u201d. The lesson he was trying to instill is that before you reach out to prospective advisors, you should do thorough research and send a very detailed email expressing your interest.\n\nHis lesson has some merit of course. A detailed email is much more likely to pique the interest of your PI than one that blends in with the sea of generic emails. That being said, sending extremely detailed expressions of interest to every PI you want to work with is, in most cases, impossible. For example, across all my applications I listed roughly 40 PIs who I would be interested in working with. To send emails to every single one of them that were up to the level of scrutiny that my cranky professor expects would probably have taken me 60ish hours. This activity is not worth my, nor anyone\u2019s time. Depending on the school, there is a decent chance that the PI you want to work with might have little to no say on whether you are even admitted to the program.\n\nAnother factor to consider when crafting an email to your dream PI is that they may not want to be emailed. When I was applying, I found many PIs who explicitly solicited emails from prospective grad students on their website. I also found a fair few who stated explicitly that they are not interested in hearing from prospective grad students, and that those interested should contact them only after admittance.\n\nHere is my certified best strategy for reaching out to PIs. Pick out one or two who you are very interested in working with and invest some serious time familiarizing yourself with their research and crafting a detailed email that showcases just how much you care. As for the rest, I just picked about half to send an email that was as detailed as I could muster without really getting into the weeds of their research. I mostly just bothered the professors from the lower ranked schools on my list, and didn\u2019t bother joining the thousands of students who were filling up the inboxes of the professors at MIT.\n\nA few of my low effort emails garnered responses, which resulted in interviews. I also received an interview and an acceptance from one of the more highly ranked schools I applied to, despite not reaching out to any faculty there. There is certainly value in reaching out to faculty, but there is also value in your time. Don\u2019t get caught up wasting too much of it reading about professors you will never meet.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678229388.0},{"title":"I feel guilty about waiting for admits from my top preferences after receiving admits from my 2nd preferences","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gradadmissions\/comments\/11l3eia\/i_feel_guilty_about_waiting_for_admits_from_my\/","text":"What makes it even worse is that many people could be on the waitlist of my 2nd preferences and I might be the one responsible for their agony.
