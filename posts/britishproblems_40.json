They paid £53.70 for the parcels, but the items inside are probably worth much more than that\n\nThey live in a building with 2 flats - everyone was in, along with the other flat. We understand it's not the driver's fault their front door is busted, but there were definitely steps the driver should've taken but didn't\n\nIt's SO frustrating considering that even contacting Evri will result in absolutely F all - even if they're the ones at fault. Even more frustrating they're STILL a shit company providing shit service, regardless of rebranding from Hermes. I hope karma eats their asses up.",
