        "text": "Hello enthusiasts, beginner and seasoned brewers,\n\nI have been enjoying the beans of a local roaster near me for some time. (Black and white coffee roasters)\n\nHowever, I'd like to branch out and see what other roasters have to offer. I can appreciate different types of espresso, but I have 2 general \"types\" of beans I'm looking for.\n\n1. I'd like to find a bean that has incredible texture, and a classic style flavor. I would love to find something that has a surprisingly thick and syrupy feel to it, and preferably with that classic chocolate or caramely flavor to it.\n\n2. I'd also like to find a roast that is nearly opposite. Something wildly fruity, almost suspiciously so. I had a strawberry flavored roast from Black and white from a roaster called Guzman that almost had a strawberry yogurt flavor that I loved. As this has been discontinued, I want to know if anyone knows of something like this. Passion fruit or even pineapple would be something exciting to me.\n\n\nI'd like to thank those of you you fully read my post, and thank in advance anyone who takes the time to introduce me to the coffees I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing.",

        "text": "tl;dr I used harder water than normal to brew my coffee with a pour over dripper but kept everything else the same. The drawdown time was much faster but the taste was the same.\n\nI'm visiting my parents for the next few days and decided to bring my Kalita 155, hand grinder, and one of my coffees on the trip. They have harder water. I'm not sure what the TDS is, but it's really obvious, for example, based on how it dries your skin out after a shower. They just have a regular water filter for drinking water and making coffee, tea, etc. For reference, my water at home is about 150 ppm (120 after a Brita filter).\n\nI knew their water was harder, but I didn't know how this would affect my brew, so I just used the same grind setting I normally use for this coffee. The drawdown time was much faster, by something like 45 seconds, so I was worried that it would be under-extracted. However, the coffee tastes great, and I don't think I can tell a difference between it here and how it tastes at home. It seems the increased extraction power of the harder water has simply caused the brew to finish faster, and the two effects have canceled out, resulting in a cup with the same extraction level as if I had used softer water. This was very surprising to me. Can anyone corroborate this effect for pour over coffee?\n\nNote, I'm not advocating using hard water for brewing if you can avoid it. I was just really surprised at the huge difference in drawdown time and associated minimal difference in taste.",

        "text": "It is no secret that big businesses selling coffee are the worst.   \nI wouldn't want to drink from another cup of joe that has too much sugar, milk, or burnt flavours in it.  \nHowever, smaller businesses care about making good quality coffee with precision.   \n\n\nWhenever I drink coffee, I expect  different assortments of coffee beans, spices, subtle notes of fruit, or sweet flavours like caramel or chocolate without being excessive. I also expect it to be mixed with milk, a shot of espresso, or some liquid extracted from plants to intensify feeling \"high\". I can no longer stay caffeinated since I've become resistant to the effects of coffee. I have to drink multiple cups to achieve the \"effect\".  \n\n\nWhat must I do to achieve such quality of coffee?  \n\\-Do I have start spending a fortune or can I economically budget my purchases?  \n\\-Should I just cook the coffee or do I need to buy machinery?  \n\\-Where can I buy the best coffee beans, spices, chocolate, fruits, floral flavours, and tree nuts?  \n\\-How can I intensify the acidity of my coffee and achieve a strong effect?  \n\n\nAny answer or advice would be appreciated.",

The whole process takes around 30 hours, removes a lot of the water content and leaves you with a doubly concentrated milk.\n\nWhy not cut the process to 25% of the time by simply only freezing half the volume then separating the liquid? The water freezes first then the proteins and fat last so theoretically it should work. Right?",

My housemate is half Italian and bought me a Percolator so we can have the occasional espresso together when we both need a fast wake up. For the record, im the main coffee drinker, I'm starting to experiment with different types and generally having fun, whereas my housemate drinks tea and knows virtually nothing other than \"espresso\" about coffee.\n\nSo a few days ago, I was cleaning the house in a whirlwind because I had guests coming in the evening and I *may have* put the top half of it in the dishwasher not realising they don't go in there and then activated said dishwasher with the chemical tablet...\n\nI now have a very grey-ish top half of the percolator and the other half is clean and ready to go (housemate caught my mistake but too late so got to the bottom half before I did and explained to me they shouldn't go in there.. Is there any way to save the top half of this little thing or have I done it too much damage?",

Low usage - maybe 5 cups a day between the two of us.   \n\nI purchased an Oxo 8-cup due to its single cup functionality and excellent overall reviews. However, I've tried both single cup into mug, and four cup into carafe - and it seems like the coffee just doesn't get very hot at all.   This is without adding any milk or other additives.  It's not that hot to begin with, and cools off quickly.\n\nSearching on here, I've seen a mention or two of this with the Oxo 8-cup, and there are several mentions of it in the Amazon reviews.\n\nIs my unit just a dud - so I should just exchange it - or it is just the way this unit is?   My Keurig K-Supreme gets noticeably hotter, and the coffee stays warmer much longer.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

        "text": "Hello, I have just purchased a moccamaster select because I‚Äôm lazy and pouring water over ground coffee is too much like hard work in the morning.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I bought this thing was because it has a hot plate but EU regs state for the device past 2015 mean it turns off after 40 minutes.\n\nThis is not ideal, I wanted the machine to brew me a big batch of coffee and keep it warm for at least 2 hours.\n\nI know, just make another batch bro! But the moccamaster shines when it‚Äôs at full capacity and I don‚Äôt want to drink ‚Äú20 cups‚Äù of coffee (6 mugs).\n\nCan it be modified to bypass the auto off? Most posts about modifying the hot plate consist of cutting the wires to disable it - which is the complete opposite of what I want to achieve.\n\nI want 2 hour old stale coffee dammit.\n\n(Real reason I got this and want the time extended, I‚Äôm expecting a child and just wanted to make brewing coffee easier and keep it hot while doing other things)",
