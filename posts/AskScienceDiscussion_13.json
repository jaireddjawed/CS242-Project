        "text": "I am interested in L1-like orbits in slightly elliptical orbits (specifically for the Sun-Earth system). Considering a perfectly circular two-body orbit in the non-inertial co-rotating reference frame, the L1 equilibrium point is a stationary location where there is no net acceleration (in the non-inertial reference frame). Of course, in an elliptical orbit there is no such point, but nonetheless I assume there is some closed orbit in which (left unperturbed) an object would repeatedly return to the same location. Is that the case? If so is there a name for such a family of orbit, or a family of orbits which I could google? My intuition says during such an orbit, while the Earth is approaching the Sun, the L1-like point would also be moving towards the sun, but at a slower rate than the Earth (so it would also be moving closer to the Earth), and then at the point the Earth begins receding from the Sun the L1-like point would also recede from the sun (but again at a slower rate so it would also grow more distant from the Earth.) And in this way the L1-like point would oscillate radially with the same period as the Earth's orbit. Is that about right? Would there be any additional orthogonal movement? If so, how much orthogonal movement would occur? (I'm particularly curious if the L1-like point would ever move outside the angular disk of the sun as viewed from Earth, but I can also investigate this if it's easy to characterize the orthogonal movement in some other way.)",

        "text": "Hey there!\n\nRecently,  I've started reading up some pretty basic stuff about String theory,  and I have a few questions regarding it. I swear I tried to find answers  to them online a lot, but I simply couldn't...... Apologies in advance  if you find these questions dumb.....\n\nBefore the actual questions, here's a very brief understanding of String theory from my side:\n\n1. ST  isn't a unified, well defined theory as of now. There are many versions  of it, with M theory being the most popular, as it loosely combines the  six largest STs. Hence, I'll be talking about M theory from now on.  Again, there does not exist a definite mathematical formulation of M  theory yet.\n2. M  theory sticks by the Standard model, and replaces the point-like  assumed nature of particles by strings. Doing so makes stuff a lot more  elegant by getting rid of infinities.\n3. M  theory requires 11 dimensions, where 7 of them are curled up, and very  small. So small in fact, that their presence cannot be tested using  current tech.\n4. M  theory cannot survive without super symmetry. Super symmetry again,  hasn't been proven experimentally (either because it's wrong, or  particle accelerators are too low energy atm). However, the idea of  Super Symmetry isn't that far fetched, as its existence answers  countless questions theoretically. We also have a possible hint  regarding their existence by ANITA's findings (2016).\n\n**Now, this is the main part that I'm here for:**\n\nThe  curled up dimensions can be shaped in many many many many ways. Their  shape specifically determines the laws of physics in our universe.\n\nIf  we somehow get to know the shape that matches that of our universe's  curled dimensions (presuming that such a shape does indeed exist), we  would be able to make predictions of properties of particles that would  match with those in our universe. This would make M theory testable to a  degree.\n\nIs what I said above  correct? Is this a main hindrance to M theory today? If the above is  correct, then I would have to assume that the mathematics that involves  the shapes has a one-way function somewhere. This one way function is  the thing that is preventing us from simply reversing everything,  essentially giving us a correct formulation. Apologies for my completely  fked up terminologies.\n\nNow again, if what I have said above is true, then why can't we use quantum computers to get past this one way function?\n\nI  have a grade 12 understanding of physics on the mathematical level. The  undergrad program of my choice does not involve physics. Assuming this,  if I just want to learn string theory -&gt; M theory mathematically,  then could anyone please recommend a roadmap of sorts? Ie, certain  concepts that are quintessential to understanding M theory.\n\nThank you so much if you even read till the end! Hope you have an amazing day!!!! &lt;3",

How is a single element forming any rectangle, how is that a rectangular array? \n\nAnother definition goes like, \n\nA matrix is an orderly arrangement of numbers in rows and columns, enclosed within, usually square brackets. \n\nWorks well most the times, but what about if I arrange some numbers in this fashion:\n\n1\n2 2\n3 3 3\n4 4 4 4\n\nI have rows and columns here, it's an orderly arrangement, but it's not a matrix right?  \n\nI have seen this context dependency of definitions of terms many times in science, just wanted to know whether in such cases we should try to find better definitions or remember the fact that definitions are indeed context dependent?",

Called a hull magnetron.  Then, they said you got a cavity magnetron, which has plates that act as capacitors, and the electrons flow through the disc(very professional terms here) and oscillate that way. So I get it, the size of the disc(the distance between the plates?) determines the frequency. But they zoom out, &amp; you still have the natural magnet right there.\n\nSo  here's my flunked out of college mind thinking, \"dude that's an NE555  and 2 electromagnets.\"(maybe some shit in the middle, like an opamp or a relay) According to [this article](https://www.eclipsemagnetics.com/resources/difference-between-electromagnet-permanent-magnet/) (from a company the specializes in magnets), electromagnets are even cheaper to source. There are other things to consider, such as heat, but how hot would that get anyways? All you'd have to do is have the timer  oscillate between a high &amp; low frequency, and have that control the strength of the electromagnet (just change the strength of the field a little bit (what do you call it, grade?), not turn it off completely  yk).\n\nI haven't messed with circuits of this power, nor have I used an NE555 in any real project,  but I'm just wondering.

My goal is to be able to travel to places like the Amazon Rainforest, Antarctica, the deep ocean, etc. in order to combat climate change, and leave our planet better off than when I found it. I don't want to work in an office, I want to be out in the field seeing the earth.\n\nMy current degree choice is Environmental science but upon further research, I'm afraid it's primarily paperwork and government work with little opportunities to travel to remote places. I'm considering ecology and biology as well- I know I want to do something with science, I just don't know what exactly yet. \n\nBackground on me that isn't fully necessary so feel free to skip this part if you don't feel like reading more...\n\nI grew up in Ohio where I earned my private pilot license at 19, I joined the Air Force and ended up working as a mechanic for 4 years (I was miserable the whole time), I spent some time working in real estate and still own property that operates as an AirBnB in Florida. I also graduated from an 8 month program for Radio &amp; TV Broadcasting, although it was a shit school.  \nNow I live near the mountains and prioritize traveling and new experiences. I've been to Ecuador, Canada, Iceland, Mexico, Peru, and 32 states including Alaska and Hawaii. My passion lies in traveling but I feel guilty the more I travel because my carbon footprint is getting bigger and bigger with each trip- hence my interest in wanting to work in the green space. I spent a few days in the Amazon rainforest back in May '22 and it changed the way I view our world. Even the most remote places have been affected by humans and I'm sick of not doing my part. Our planet and the species that live on it deserve better. Any and all suggestions are appreciated and wanted. \n\nIf you work in the green space- what do you do? Do you enjoy your job?

After the development of the 7nm process and the introduction of EUV lithography technology, FinFET structure encountered physical limits at the 3nm node. Since then, the two leaders in advanced [manufacturing](https://go-gale-com.ezproxy.umgc.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;hitCount=40043&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=ZCDB&amp;prodId=CDB&amp;pageNum=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=umd_umuc&amp;inPS=true#) processes have diverged. TSMC continues utilizing FinFET structure in mass-produced 3nm products in 2H22, which will be officially released in 1H23, with the scale of mass production increasing quarter by quarter. In 2023, TSMC 3nm products will include PC CPU and smartphone SoC. Samsung began introducing the GAAFET-based MBCFET architecture (Multi-Bridge Channel Field-Effect Transistor) at 3nm and this process will begin mass-production in 2022. Its first-generation product is a cryptocurrency mining chip. In 2023, Samsung will focus on second generation 3nm processes, with a goal of mass-producing smartphone SoCs. Both companies remain focused on high-performance computing and smart phone platforms in the initial stage of 3nm mass production as these products have higher requirements for improving performance, lowering power consumption, and reducing chip area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nDevelopment Trends Focus on Automotive IC Design, Third Generation [Semiconductors](https://go-gale-com.ezproxy.umgc.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;hitCount=40043&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=ZCDB&amp;prodId=CDB&amp;pageNum=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=umd_umuc&amp;inPS=true#) on the Rise\n\nThe automotive industry is trending towards C-A-S-E, driving demand for automotive semiconductors. Automotive semiconductors are essentially divided into two categories: IDM and Fabless. As traditional automotive chip suppliers, IDMs offer a fairly complete selection of various ECUs and have gradually evolved from a traditional distributed architecture to Domain Control Unit (DCU) and Zone Control Unit (ZCU) architectures. Fabless continues to focus on the field of high-performance computing for vehicles and develop in-vehicle telematics systems and SoCs for self-driving computing. Due to the complexity of automotive functions, the 32-Bit MCU type ECU has become the mainstream specification in the market. In 2023, its penetration rate will exceed 60 percent with a market value reaching US$7.4 billion and it will develop towards processes below 28nm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nNew DRAM Generation Takes Shape, Development of 200+ Layer NAND Flash Accelerates\n\nIn 2023, not only will server [CPUs](https://go-gale-com.ezproxy.umgc.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;hitCount=40043&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=ZCDB&amp;prodId=CDB&amp;pageNum=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA721943640&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=umd_umuc&amp;inPS=true#) such as Intel Sapphire Rapids and AMD Genoa support CXL 1.0, but DRAM modules will also employ DDR5. Furthermore, in order to run AI and ML (Machine Learning) operations effectively, certain server GPUs will introduce a new generation of HBM3 specifications.\n\nIn terms of NAND Flash, the number of stacked layers will accelerate in 2023 and four suppliers are expected to move towards 200+ layer technology. Some manufacturers will even mass-produce PLC (Penta Level Cell), hoping for an opportunity to replace HDD applications on servers in the future as unit growth is further optimized. In terms of SSD transfer interfaces, with the mass production of Intel Sapphire Rapids and AMD Genoa in 2023, enterprise SSDs will be further upgraded to support PCIe 5.0 transfer, increasing transfer rate manifold to 32GT/s to be utilized for high-speed computing needs such as AI/ML and also contributing to the rapid increase in the average capacity of enterprise SSDs.",

However, the X chromosome of the males are the exact same as the females? If that's the case, why would they still developed into male? Is it because their body require two X chromosomes in order to develop ovaries and uterus? Which means the default gender of the Transcaucasian mole voles would be male, and the default sex organ will be the testis now? Also, the mechanism of producing male Ellobius will be that some of their sperms don't contain any sex chromosomes, while all eggs contain one X chromosome, so when the eggs get fertilized some will have two X chromosoms which becomes female and some only has one which becomes male? If the two X chromosomes are exactly same, what suppresses their gonad from developing testis like how the SRY gene suppresses gonads from developing ovaries and uterus so that they won't become hermaphrodite? Can anyone provide a better explanation of how the gender determining mechanism work in Ellobius?",

But I was thinking today, if you’re in a deficit… doesn’t the law of conservation of energy essentially dictate that you have to lose weight? If you’re in a deficit then you’re by definition burning more energy than you’re taking in. Energy can’t come from nothing, so wouldn’t you have to lose weight? Or am I fundamentally misunderstanding the physics behind weight loss?",

        "text": "Hi. I will try to explain what happens to me.\n\nThrough the past years I've had severe anxiety and panic attacks, since 2017. At first I didn't know what it was, but now I can tell that in practice I'm an expert on it. I've had two really bad time periods of anxiety. One between September and November 2017 and other one between September and December 2020. It was not because of any seasonal cause, it's just a coincidence. Each time it cured itself but the second time didn't really go away as well.\n\nThe thing is, about 3 months ago I really started thinking about my problem and put a food on the path of trying to solve it. So I started thinking.\n\nMy first panic attack was caused by a weed joint. That time period was hard for me but I didn't really know what anxiety or panic disorders were. I had anxiety and panic attacks all the time. Thinking now about what happened, I know that my body's reaction was to cut off in the production of adrenaline, norepinephrine and cortisol, because every time I had this chills or tremors starting from my upper back (where the adrenal glands are) I would have an anxiety or panic attack. So my body learned by itself to stop,  but I didn't know all this back then.\n\nTwo years went by and I was basicly fine, didn't really think about it. But in 2020 I started taking some hair supplement (saw palmetto + zinc) which I really didn't inform myself about. And also I didn't really get much sleep. So from november 2019 to September 2020 I had been taking this supplement and having this personality changes without noticing. My theory is that the excess zinc caused me to undermethylate (I was taking a 150% daily recommended value of zinc a day) plus the side effects on the saw palmetto, but that's not the case.\n\nOn September 2020 I have a huge panic attack, due to lack of sleep, the effects of the supplement and just my previous intolerance to adrenaline. It was also a horrible time period, with constant panic and anxiety attacks. I couldn't sleep either. So again, my body heals itself by blocking once again the segregation of this stress hormones from the adrenal glands. But this time I just felt that it didn't cure itself as well.\n\nI recover myself, 2021 was just fine. Stop taking the supplement and start healing myself mentally in a healthy way.\n\nSo then, three months ago, I noticed every time I had this chill/tremor in my back, my anxiety increased and some time I got on the verge of a panic attack. And I also noticed I could control those chills. So I started experimenting. Every time y used the chill, my self-steem increased, my resistance and strength in sports increased, I could think faster and be more creative, have a sharper mind. But also if I overdid them I got on the verge of a panic attack and my anxiety increased. So I started investigating. I noticed in the mirror that every time I did the chills my pupils dilated. Now it's been 3 months of controlling them and my metabolism has got faster (I need more calories every day), my sports performance has also improved as well as my mental sharpness. I can make the chills happen anytime anywhere. If I overdo them it gets a bit harder, but I still can.\n\nThese days I've been taking a vitamin C supplement for other reasons, and I noticed that the chills got smoother and thicker. I did some investigation and read that vitamin C actually helps the adrenal glands to produce this hormones.\n\nIs my theory right or is there anything that I'm missing?\nPlease let me know :)",

Another common claim is that medical researchers have long known that certain medications do not work, but refuse to publish these findings because their careers depend on publishing papers showing that they do work.\n\nThis seems like an altogether too convenient excuse, but I wanted to step back and ask whether there are legitimate reasons that a scientific result would be suppressed. I do know that there are many experiments that are not done because doing so would be unethical, but I am more talking about experiments that have already been done but whose results evince inconvenient truths, embarrass the researchers or the researchers' peers or funders, or are otherwise socially or financially advantageous to suppress.

        "text": "I tried posting this in r/askscience and I don't think they liked it much there, even though it seems like a crucial question involving science.  Anyways.  \n\nI was thinking about it, and it seems to me there are a million ways that you could prove along scientific lines that people are in fact un-equal, along a million different metrics. But **to propose any sort of essential equality between human beings (as beings?) - is science alone even capable of doing this?** And, given the difference of difficulty in proving the two opposing propositions off the bat, one cannot avoid that this question - whether we have explicitly considered it or not - inevitably has deep ramifications.\n\nI was just thinking about the line in the Declaration of Independence - \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" and wondering where that idea sits today in a world increasingly dominated by a scientific worldview (not that it really went very far back then besides sounding nice anyways, being that they still had slavery for example).\n\nOf course you might say that such propositions are assumed or made in the \"soft sciences\". ( I wasn't really sure how to flair this post to be honest.) But does that really garner the same respect these days as the ongoing demand for \"hard evidence\"? There's nearly an infinite amount of what would qualify these days as \"hard evidence\" that x person is superior to y person (or people) along z metric(s), and this is the culture we are continually bathed in I feel like.\n\nThere's also something to be said about the use of different facile interpretations of science facts for different preconceived desired ideological ends. That is to say, one could easily interpret equality from the fact of certain shared characteristics of all humans. But, in the face of all the things that can differ, and the intense degrees to which they sometimes differ - you would leave a lot of people unconvinced. So even if you've convinced yourself to satisfaction, which might be easier to do given that you have a desire to believe in equality - is that explanation really good enough?\n\nBiological characteristics, intellectual, creative or athletic abilities aside - you also have meticulously constructed palaces of concrete achievements and empires belonging to certain individuals making names for themselves. And those are all things which are provable to exist - \"hard evidence\" - and could be seen as a testament to inherent \"inequality\" amongst humans. And in the case of many of those empires, the very fact of their existence are also sometimes themselves seen as proof as justification for their existence in the first place - whether or not they may cause harm to other beings.\n\nI know at that point it may sound to be getting off the topic of science, but the way that popular culture has taken on \"pop science\" and the idea of needing \"hard evidence\" for anything to be seen as true and then possibly unconsciously applying it to fields where it may not be most appropriate - is at least interesting, if nothing else, in a sociological, anthropological or psychological way.\n\nAnyways, overall, what do you think? Is science up to the task of meaningfully \"proving\", scientifically, an essential equality to all human beings? Is it incapable? If so, is it only currently incapable and may it one day be capable? Lastly, and you don't have to answer this, but - assuming equality is a necessary ideal to maintain for a healthy democratic society, and in the case that a metaphysics may seem ultimately necessary, then any ideas on how would we begin to go about that? Or, alternatively, if there ever was a situation in which metaphysics seemed to appear to become necessary - would you prefer to leave those stones unturned?",
