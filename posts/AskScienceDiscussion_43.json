Why aren't scientists required to submit their research proposal and methodology to scientific journals before beginning their experiments?  \n\n\nThis seems like a simple solution to both improve the scientific rigor of the review process and prevent unnecessary duplication of efforts, while building a larger body of potentially useful negative results. As the process stands, there's little if any incentive to publish or otherwise make available negative results. Requiring that research proposals be submitted to journals before the start of the experiment in order for the experiment to qualify for later publishing would incentivise scientists to report all their results, not just the ones that appear exciting. The body of negative results generated could be useful for deciding on new avenues of research. Even if there's no hard requirement for publishing the results later on, this would still help when evaluating the trustworthiness of positive results \\- as a large number of previous proposals without reported results could be used to determine if there's potentially selective reporting going on.  \n\n\nI don't understand why this isn't a formal requirement to get published in a major journal like Nature. It would require no significant additional effort on anyone's part \\- the scientists already have to make their proposal and methodology before beginning their experiment, so all they would need to do is send what they've already written off in an email. The journals wouldn't have to put in any additional effort to evaluate the proposals unless the results were later submitted and considered to be potentially important.  \n\n\nSo why isn't this a part of the scientific process? Why don't journals simply put their foot down and outright reject any submitted research that doesn't have a corresponding pre-submitted proposal?",

Maybe a professor that didn't do anything is listed as author just because of status. Maybe a student is put in a paper without contributing substantially to the work.\n\nIn physics, large experimental collaboration such as LHC, Atlas, and many others (particle accelerators) produce publications with an 'infinity' list of authors, including, coders, engineers, technicians and so on.\n\nNow, I ask myself if it makes sense. Where do you draw the line? People that indeed contribute with ideas and labor, let's say to a brilliant Physical Review Letters that uses LHC data, is certainly less than 10% of the authors list. The others can be seen as leeches, in the lines of the article I referenced, farming citations and so on. People have been questioning publication ethics.

Right near my bed, fairly close to head-level, is a wall socket. For some time I've slept like this no problem, but it doesn't make me stop being curious about what would happen if, while I was sleeping, some hair of mine managed to get into the socket. With me as well, I have a full head of dreadlocks with wispy ends that would probably allow more hair to enter than the average person. Also, I sometimes go to bed with wet dreadlocks from a shower (yes, my dreads are CLEAN ;)). What do you think would happen if I stuck a dreadlock in the wall socket? \n\nNow, it's established that hair conducts static electricity. This I know. But would that make it possible for me to get my head get zapped if I put my hair in a socket?\n\nI'm asking the real questions, I realize. I hope this sort of thing is tolerated here. It's goofy, but I'd also seriously like to know.",
