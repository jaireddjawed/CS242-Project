Now I’m scrambling trying to figure out wtf I was trying to do before that. \n\nI basically need to restart and get part time work. Im not looking for a pity party, but I do wish my parents could be more understanding of the setbacks I experience. Im always hesitant to bring anything up because they have very specific ideas of what they want from me and the minute I step out of that line, I’m usually in trouble \n\nLike right now, I can’t even leave the house to go print resumes because I’m worried I’ll get questioned. I also struggle to get out of bed early because of mild depression so I lose almost half the day.\n\nIm not trying to be a failure but there’s so much pressure and there doesn’t appear to be any legroom for mistakes.",

I have the worse muscle genetics ive ever seen(im the weakest 18 year old i know when compared to people who dont even work out). In akward moments i get red as fuck(shows even more bc of my paleness, which doesnt go away in the summer). I have inward knees. I had a huge double chin even when i was 60kg and 169cm tall(this is quite skinny). I know there is no point in complaining, but it is annoying to see that my bio brother has above average genetics while i have the shittiest genetics out of anyone I know.",

        "text": "The title may come off as an obvious answer, but hear me out.\n\nI don't know if I have a video game addiction. I don't think I do, I think I just enjoy them. They don't get in the way of my social life or physical health, but sometimes I just completely disregard my other daily duties to play video games, usually in the form of neglecting school. For example, this past Sunday I had quite a bit of homework/notes for almost every class I'm currently taking, and I had this big plan to get all of it done, do my laundry, go to the store, and clean my room completely then relax for the rest of the evening. I had a volleyball tournament the day prior so I wasn't working out that day to give my body some rest. All I had to do was school and self care stuff. Fast forward to about 10 PM Sunday night and I hadn't even touched any homework due at 11:59 PM that night nor did I do any of the chores I wanted to do. I played video games all day. \n\nTry as I did, I didn't get all of my homework done. Defeated, with another zero in the gradebook in a messy room, I sat on my floor and cried HARD. The first time I've cried in a very, very long time. I felt completely hopeless and defeated and disgusted with my lack of control around these screens and games. Once I picked myself up, I deleted every video game I had and every social media app off of my phone (that was another reason why I didn't get anything done). This isn't the first time that I've put important stuff off because of video games, and I've even deleted video games before, but this is the time when I really decided that I wanted to change and that I was sick and tired of feeding into this feeling of comfort and laziness. I always come back to them, but I think at this point I've proven to myself that I can't control myself around them, so I decided to just send them to the shadow realm, never to be seen again.\n\nNow, back to the title, in my odd scenario, would it be better to just keep the video games and social media out of my life, or is there benefit in trying it again but making a point to discipline myself and not go overboard, even though I've already tried and failed at that a few times?",

This summer I graduated from one of the best universities in the world in my field with one of the highest grades in my cohort, and I got a job that puts me well in the top 1%. I stay active and in college I won a couple sport medals. Outside of covid I had a pretty good dating life in college as well. I've got a few a different hobbies and side projects going on, yet I'm absolutely miserable.\n\nI hate how much you can work and have nothing to show for it in terms of your wellbeing. I don't enjoy my current job, uni was nice overall when I wasnt stressing over deadlines. But overall I think the pains, the stresses and the sadness in my life has always been much larger than any pleasure I've derived from it. Material comfort comes at the price of your time and energy, girls come at the price of your emotional health, and hobbies are hard to make time for if you want a career.\n\nI feel like I've been working hard to get these golden keys, that unlock a new gate into a world you imagine to be full of grandeur and excitement, only to realise that it's the same dull grey as in all the other rooms. I sometimes wonder if it'd have been better had I not worked hard, I probably would've been equally miserable but with more hours of sleep and a few less wrinkles.\n\nI'm always pushing myself thinking that, if I keep working, at some point it'll feel worth it. One more book, one more class, one more social event, one more new hobby or skill or workout. But I feel exactly as I did when I was 18, only more tired and with less hope for the future. I sometimes daydream about suicide, but I know it isnt an option as it would be unfair to my loved ones. I'm just so disillusioned, and I don't know what to aspire to anymore.",

Today was an especially difficult day due to some internal fuck ups, and I had to take the lead. I've been experiencing panic attacks for the first time in the last few months also.\n\nI've been seeing a great therapist for the last few months and have made some incredible progress in myself on a lot of issues I'd had, but one area I unfortunately haven't seen much progress in is my self-esteem. Other than that, I have a great group of friends and I am doing a lot better than I have before.\n\nI've recently opened myself up to dating again, which has been fun but it gets complicated - especially when you're unsure of what you want. I've been the difficult one in relationships, but I have also experienced the feeling of being used or strung along. I'm trying to learn more about what I want and not repeat past mistakes, but because it's been so long I'm still pretty naive and unsure of myself. Like I said, it gets complicated.\n\nI don't take compliments very well, and I'm very insecure  and self-critical. I'm less outwardly insecure now but it can come out now and then.\n\nThe thing is, I can be just so unhappy sometimes and all I feel is that I need more. I can be impulsive and at some times reckless. I've never quite valued myself and I don't really understand what it means to value myself. I try to take care of myself but when things get difficult, it can spiral. I feel as though I'm about to enter a depressive episode, and I'm sincerely scared because I felt like I have just overcome a major one. I'm scared something is going to happen that's going to knock me back over the edge, and I'm once again going to utterly fail and lose my friends.\n\nThere's no reason for me to be afraid of losing my friends unless I outwardly hurt anyone, but I have lost friends in the past and I struggle a lot with shame.\n\nI'm basically asking - is a cold shower and waking up early tomorrow really going to fix things? I do this pretty regularly, but is it really going to fix me? \n\nWhat's up with my insecurities? I want to figure this out.",

        "text": "I  (M45) recently broke up with my ex (F41)) after 2yrs because (among other reasons) I wanted to live together at some point and have kids while she didn't want any of that, ever. A bigger issue for me as a man was my perceived 'inexperience' with sex, having had my first experience in my late 30's and not much after that. For us both this was our first committed relationship, in this regard I'd found my perfect match.. \n\nLooking back now almost 6 months later I think she lost respect for me bc I couldn't accept myself and my past fully, I was convinced she judged me for my 'inexperience'. She often said that she couldn't 'feel me' during sex, so ofcourse I assumed I was bad at it and needed to improve my 'technique', unsurprisingly I was in my head all the time, at some point she didnt want to make out anymore. So sex became this huge issue in my mind that I needed to fix and took up a lot of mental space, but eventually we had less and less of it and what was left was routine. I wasn't satisfied and I couldn't satisfy her anymore and became more and more resentfull of her. \n\nBasically my ex confronted me with this innate fear (and shame) of mine that I'm still not able to satisfy a woman properly, it's a defect so I need to gain as much sexual experience as I can to be able to function as 'normal man' again. I know intuitively (?) that this is not true and that the key lies in more selfacceptance, but I don't have enough positive real life experiences to back this up. So I really do feel often feel like a disabled person in flirting and it restricts me in my interaction with (attractive) women...being constantly on guard how they might perceive me and if they find me attractive or not. When they very obviously they do, I reinterpret it as they just being nice, 'don't be a creep'.\n\n I feel I can't relax anymore as long as I'm single, this drive to find a new mate trumps all my education and career goals ! How do I fix this mindset ? \n\nMy therapist remarked that I should become more 'embodied' so I can get out of my critical overthinking mind. I already do crossfit and cold immersion, I used to do a lot of yoga, but being around women all the time (he says) might not be the best thing for me, I need to be more around men. True, I have lost most of longtime male friends to having families of their own, so making new male friends just to get to women... What do you think ? \n\nFor those familiar with Enneagrams, I'm a 'sexual 9', ironically. Enneagrams really confronted me with my blind spots, but also made me realize I'm not 'weird' after all, there are many more like me. \n\ntldr: I have limiting beliefs around my sexuality that only get reinforced by (seeming) negative experiences, which restrict me more in finding a new partner which in turn undermines all my other more important goals. How to fix this ? More therapy or more exposure to dating to get over the fear ?",

I also get very needy, if there is a minor inconvenience, if I get sick or if I feel frustrated I absolutely have to vent. It’s usually to my partner via text as something is happening to me, who has told me it’s fine to do so but he won’t always be able to immediately reply. I can tell he sometimes gets fed up with how many problems and complaints I have. At least several a day. When I get sick, the people around me genuinely get annoyed very quickly. If I have a problem, I google it and if that doesn’t work I immediately come onto Reddit and make a post to see if it can be solved (like now).\n\nHow do I manage my emotions better and stop being so needy and reliant on outside help to make me feel better? I know to always think before sending a text, and I take deep breathes etc but in the moment, nothing else matters and I have to vent. Any advice?",

All i do everyday is go to work &amp; back home into my bed. I know laying down all day is bad for me, it makes me feel lazy and disgusting.\n The past year i started cleaning around the house more, which use to be a total struggle, i’d literally cry. I’ve had friends offer to help me clean around the house but i can’t accept their help because i need to learn to do it myself and i don’t want to rely on anyone to clean my filth. \n\nI struggle with depression and anxiety, and it’s hard for me to even get up and shower sometimes. I’ve tried the gym a few times but i get so overwhelmed there, scared people are staring at me, i don’t know how to start, i just feel lost at the gym. I tried yoga (absolutely love it) but there isn’t any yoga studios around me which is a disappointment. We do have a pilates studio here which i tried a  few times, also love it but the pricing is insane. i just bought my membership again ($100 for 4 classes a month) so this month i’ll go once a week and see if i’ll get in the habit of doing each week. \n\nAs i get older i don’t want to be glued to my bed anymore, i want to fill my free time i have with things that will keep me active. I don’t have any hobbies, any advice or same experiences?",

        "text": "Overcoming self-doubt and finding inner strength can be a challenging journey, but it's really important if you want to achieve your goals and live a fulfilling life in your terms. These are some of the things ive focused, manifested, and then acted on that created a shift in the type of lifestyle i was living before. Hopefully some of these tips can help you. Feel free to share your thoughts. \n\n1. **Challenge your negative thoughts -** Self-doubt often stems from negative self-talk. Everytime i thought of a negative outcome or a negative \" what if\" i immediately caught myself and literally shifted that thought. Over and over and over again!!! Never allowing my thoughts to go on a tangent of negativity. It's important to challenge those thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones.\n2. **Take action** \\- Everyday do 1 thing that you're afraid of that you know for a fact would inch you closer to your goals. I would often write a list of 5 things i was afraid to do that i knew they would make me better. I acted on them until that fear lost its power over me. The best way to overcome self-doubt is to simply take action and prove to yourself that you are capable. Start with small steps and build up from there.\n3. **Surround yourself with positivity** \\-  Limit the negative friends and conversations. Reach out to people that inspire you, show love, start to become what you what! Surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people that boost your confidence and remind you of your strengths.\n4. **Practice self-care** \\-  Every day i treated my Thursdays as selfcare days. I would search endlessly on groupon for deals for massages, acupuncture, etc.  Taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health is crucial for building inner strength.\n5. **Celebrate your successes** \\- Even the small wins! The fact that you reach 10 days of being consistent is worth noted. When you achieve a goal or overcome a challenge, take the time to celebrate and acknowledge your accomplishment. This can help build momentum and keep you motivated.\n\n6. **Remember this** \\- this is a forever process - each level is going to require more of us! More faith, more strength, bigger shoulder to carry the burdens of growth, sacrifice and commitments.",

One I still haven’t been able to do yet is quoting nicotine. This year I’ve managed to make one last longer when I’m consciously not hitting it every 10 min. I’ve been vaping since my senior year of hs (20 now) and I know it’s bad but every time I kill one I say it’s my last and after a day of cravings I seem to always go back. I know vaping is easier to bring down the percentage but most individual bottles are nowhere near what’s in a disposable vape. Already created account for free nicotine patches but I haven’t received them yet. Outside of the actual nicotine I think the flavor is what’s keeping me hooked.

I've always had it really non consistent with almost everything in life. 3 failed relationships, 2 mutual, 1 bad heartbreak, all my exes are happily married, an unstable career in hospitality since I started in 2017, I've changed like 9 jobs. My last job was contractual that ended Jan 31st. I'm back in my native city it's been more than a month of me applying jobs and getting nothing at all. It's the same cycle that's repeating from last year. I'm an embarrassing 105 kgs, I've spent like a huge amount of my savings from my last job in eating junk and buying things I probably didn't really need. My mom works a 12-14 hours job at 54 at a school and it's really embarrassing and disappointing to not do anything to help. We've been living in a rented house almost my entire life, parents divorced, the father keeps lecturing me on how I'm a failed son and is mostly sarcastic all the time. I don't hate him I hate myself. I fail at dating, relationships, career, jobs, keeping myself healthy and now even losing my financial stability. I can't sleep because of the insecurities I have of going broke (again), never being able to have a partner in life (again) and maybe getting depressed for months (again). Over the past 2 years I've joined and quit gym 4 times, wasted money, sold off my bicycle too and I was kinda excited to start swimming from today but my doc said i can't (due to Lasik surgery) i need to wait at least months before i can. Swimming and cycling are the only things I used to enjoy. I dunno how to get past all this. My friends my age getting married and my parents and family are constantly comparing me indirectly pointing to how I'm a failure at everything. It's friggin embarrassing and that makes me angry about myself. I don't know what to do. I'm nothing.  A \"Good for nothing\" as mom says when she's pissed.",

It was hard at first, because my fingers kept itching to pick up my phone and check Instagram, but I resisted the urge and stayed present in the moment.\n\nAnd you know what? It was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time! I was able to fully engage with my friends and have a meaningful conversation without any distractions.\n\nIt might not seem like a big deal, but for me, it was a small victory in my battle against smartphone addiction. It's easy to get discouraged and feel like you'll never be able to break the habit, but every little step forward is worth celebrating.\n\nSo, what small victories have you had in your own journey to overcome smartphone addiction? Maybe you left your phone in another room during dinner, or you resisted the urge to check your email first thing in the morning. Whatever it is, let's celebrate these small victories and use them as motivation to keep pushing forward. We got this!",

Not angry, sad, or bitter about it anymore but its just been a downward spiral since.\n\nI'm just bored, apathetic, and emotionless all the time. Perpetual sadness filling my chest and causing pressure in my head.\n\nI just feel like I'm not a person anymore. Life happens around me but it doesnt seem like I get to partake in it.\n\nMost of my day is spent in silence. Only people I ever really say anything to are my coworkers. Friends are always busy, we never get to hangout anymore.\n\nI work nightshift now, further isolating me. I live with family and Ive never had issues with them but its just \"meh\". I love them but I get no joy really from engaging with them or much of anything for that matter.\n\nMy spare time is spent mindlessly watching something or fighting just to care enough or have the attention span to do anything I usually like to do.\n\nBeen to therapy before. Took meds before. Need to start those again but I'm just... done?\n\nI'm extremely lonely and starved of any sort of affection or attention. But Im too much of a broken idiot to be worth dating. Also dating is just... meh.\n\nI keep my phone on silent because nobody ever reaches out anyways.\n\nQuite frankly you'd have to brainwash me just to make any progress it seems.\n\nMost of the time I just sleep, cant really find anything engaging to do so might as well sleep.\n\nI make ok money for the bills I have yet I can never save money tired of watching my bank account stay the same every week.\n\nMy diet is shit, I dont cook. Dont care to either.\n\nOverall, Im just screwed up in the head.\n\nThis is usually the time of day after work where I have my free time but I'm just too sad to stay awake so Im just going to sleep now.\n\nI'll check here later but it just seems like no one will really care about the post anyways.",

You just do the right thing, and you win. Real life is a lot less simple. You can do everything right, and still lose. Plus, real life is a lot more poorly balanced than most video games. With most recent games, playable characters are usually on similar power levels and viability with each other. But in real life, this is not the case\nSome people are just grossly overpowered, and have the best genetics and overall starting point in life. With the best intelligence, athletics, charisma, etc. While other people get just about nothing. Even with years of practice, they still just kinda suck. You can't \"spec\" your character into whatever you want nearly as freely in real life as you can in a video game. If you have a low IQ, good luck becoming a scientist or a doctor. Not naturally athletic? Good luck becoming a professional soccer or basketball player. etc\n\nI've escaped life via video games for this reason. If you don't have the right genetic capabilities, there's not much you can do to make yourself even somewhere on the average level of even most unimproved people. Some people are just that disadvantaged in life, and it pisses me off\n\nRegardless, I still try anyway, because I'm too stubborn to quit and I want to one day be in a position where I can piss on the gravestones of my former bullies and enemies and people who gave me shit",

I feel like I'm doing this in safety of not wanting to embrace my pain and whatever feelings or situations that triggers sadness or pain.\n\nBut don't they say that you have to look in the mirror and say all the positive affirmations and push yourself to become a stronger better positive version of yourself. Sighs, instead of helping me. I feel like I'm just fighting doubting and being harsh on myself.\n\nLike I'm 27 with no job and my family is struggling financially yet I still don't have a clear path in life like which college major or program to get into. I have so much critical self improvement to be done from getting a job to becoming confident to networking and building social skills. Reducing self doubts and anxiety and do much more.

        "text": "Tl;dr: Kind Reddit stranger, any advice for a recovering workaholic trying to change their life for the better?\n\nHi all! I (28 F) came to the realization tonight that my attitude around certain things is costing me my health, happiness, and the quality of my relationship with my partner (25 M).\n\nI grew up with instability and housing/food insecurity. As an adult, I threw myself into college and building a career. When I got sidetracked by an abusive boyfriend, I eventually got out of that relationship and earned my master’s.\n\nI teach part time at a local university, and 6 months ago I started a new job with a Fortune 100 company. I worked my butt off to show what I am capable of, and my boss was ecstatic with me, but when I asked about what a track to promotion would look like, I got the corporate run around. What did I do? I went from working 50 to 60 hours each week, of course!\n\nWell, tonight after a tearful call with my wonderful bf (I’m currently in a hotel for a work trip)I realized that I’m miserable. I’ve stopped exercising and I eat non stop now, so I’ve put on 10 lbs. I don’t sleep enough, I cry daily, and I’m stressed 24/7. I’m not being the best partner I can be for my bf.\n\nWhen I was a kid I dreamed of living a life where I didn’t sleep in a car or wonder where my next meal would come from. Now I make 6 figures and have security, so what am I doing? Trying to have a stroke by 30?\n \nI love teaching and my students, so I plan to keep that as is. Starting tonight, I will keep my hours for my regular job to 40/week. I am also going to prioritize getting consistent sleep and exercise. Lastly, I am going to limit time on my phone and spend more of it sitting around with books and coffee. \n\nI am marking tonight as a next chapter. If anyone would be kind enough to share advice on self improvement or quality of life in general for a recovering workaholic, I would be so thankful.",
