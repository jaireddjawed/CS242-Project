That is all fine and dandy, but most of the time the parts are complex and have multiple dimensions and spec limits.  So say I want to state my machine is capable of produces this complex part, do I need to run a CP study on every feature?  Say the features are different sizes, but have the same tolerances, can I use 1 CP study for all the different features using the variation as the data instead of the measurement value?\n\nIn addition, Say I have multiple different parts and multiple different features run through the same machine, can I run a CP study on their variance and get accurate results? Or do I need to do a CP study on each part separately?  I am assuming this is when the scope gets way too big and won't yield accurate results.\n\nPlease talk to me like I am 5.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/107hwfy/how_to_build_a_custom_jacketed_steam_kettle_for/",
        "text": "*Hello, I will begin this post by giving a big thanks to all who commented on my previous post* [*how to reduce the time require to heat up large volumes of milk?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/yj6ymc/how_to_reduce_the_time_required_to_heat_up_large/) *It was really insightful and I learned quite a lot in the process, so I am grateful and excited. This new post comes as a result of our choices resulting from all the suggestions made in the previous post. After looking at our various options, it seemed that the jacketed steam kettle system would be the most adapted to our small scale, artisan production.*\n\nWhile selecting the Jacketed Steam Kettle as the preferred method/tool for heating up large volumes of milk, I went and looked at our options on the market. Please bear in mind that we are in the country side in Asia so our supply chain and currency are weak.\n\nWe found different products on offer:\n\n* Alibaba vendors offer steam jacket milk pasteurizer with only a water inlet and outlet as cooling system for about 1,500-2,000 USD EXW.\n* Add a condenser to circulate cold water to the system and the price climbs to about 4,000 USD EXW.\n\nAfter looking into these products, although interesting, they are nothing exceptional from an engineering perspective. I am not allowed to post images here so you will have to use your imagination a bit: these are 200 to 300 L cylinders triple wall, with the insulation on the outer layer. The bottom of the jacket is deeper and has a heating element attached to some thermal controller. There's a tight lid with and an engine spinning a paddle to stir the content of the kettle.\n\nWe also found some more classic jacked steam kettles which are more shallow and wider, which means more surface area. These look like large bowls. This costs more, from 4,000 to 6,000 USD and no cooling system.\n\nWe also had a local importer that supplies the same typical bowl-shaped kettles for a ridiculous 30,000 USD with little explanation as to why they are so expensive.\n\n**Decision Factor 1:** The local supplier is too expensive, the import via Alibaba seems more financially sound but the quality of the products cannot be checked and my experience with Alibaba is rather disappointing. It is difficult to get any tech specs from the vendors who want me to buy first and explain later. \n\n**Decision Factor 2:** the standard shapes, either the cylinder or the bowl shapes are just OK. In fact for our purpose (cheese making) it would be preferable for us to have a rectangular shaped tub where we can do both the heating (and cooling when necessary) and processing of the milk into curd (curd setting) followed by the curd cutting.\n\n**Decision:** I am exploring the possibility of making my own using a local steel welder who has already produced some of our equipment until now. After sketching a first drawing, the initial quotation for putting the tub together would be 1,600 USD and the items to furnish the kettle (heating element, connectors, insulation are of negligible costs.\n\nWith a basic understanding of what is required to build a jacketed steam kettle, [I've drawn an initial diagram of what I am planning to build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13JKJsImQC5-VIL6iWClvCRt3Lapgz2FH/view?usp=share_link). However, I am not versed enough in mechanical engineering to know for sure that I am doing the right design choices, and I hope to get some tips here and there from you, to avoid some errors and reduce the risk. I fully understand that I am trading  one type of risk for another, but I am confident the model I choose to make will be more suitable for our business.\n\nThe kettle we are planning to make is made with 3 mm thick stainless steel. The kettle is made in the shape of a tub with an inner volume of 50x50x120 cm or 300 L capacity. It is made of two parts: \n\n* a double-walled inner tub with the steam jacket\n* an outer tub with insulation to hold the inner tub and keep the heat\n\nThe inner jacket has a thickness of about 2 cm on the sides and 10 cm at the bottom and it is V shaped at the bottom, to allow condensed steam to roll down the spine and collect centrally at the bottom and reach the heating element, as well as it helps letting the whey flow out as well as making the cleaning process easier.\n\nThere are high water inlets and outlets, the high water outlet is for the cold water when cooling the milk after pasteurization. It is at the top to ensure the entire sides of the kettle are in contact with cold water. There is a low water purge to empty the jacket. And there is a small water excess outlet when filling up the jacket with a just enough water for the heating process.\n\nThere is a steam outlet safety valve and potentially a gauge, though I think the gauge may not even be relevant. The steam jacket---it is my understanding---does not require high pressure to function, we just need the steam to stay put inside the jacket and only leave it when the pressure is excessive.\n\nThere is a heating element at the bottom of the jacket, connected to a control panel.\n\nOmissions:\n\n* there are also lids that are not added to the current design (they are not difficult to make)\n* there's the potential addition of some system to stir the milk, but for now we will go with manual stirring\n* I haven't planned the electricity inlet here yet but it doesn't seem to be a critical design problem.\n\n**Problems / Questions:**\n\n1. Is 3 mm thickness not too much for this project? A 2 mm thickness would reduce the cost considerably.\n2. Is 2 cm of jacket on the side good enough for the steam to circulate?\n3. Is 10-12 cm at the bottom of the jacket enough for the heating element to do its job?\n4. What volume of water do I need to add for the steaming process? I was thinking that a layer of 10 cm at the bottom should be enough, we want  to heat up and turn it into steam fast enough but we don't want the heating element to dry up, correct?\n5. What pressure resistance should I set for the steam valve? I have no clue on how to calculate this but I'm assuming it doesn't need high pressure so I can go with something as light or lighter than a household pressure cooker? How about 70 kpa?\n6. What heating element specs do I need? I've seen many sizes and wattages. I'm not sure what the best match would be (assume 220V power supply).\n7. Any other blunders you can spot or advice you can give?\n\nThank you again for your support, I'll be looking forward to some great comments once more.",
