        "text": "By 2030:\n\n\\- There will be six space stations in LEO (ISS, Tiangong, Axiom Station, Starlab, Orbital Reef, Russian Station)\n\n\\- NASA and SpaceX will have been on the Moon for five years (Artemis III in 2025 rn)\n\n\\- CNSA also has people on the Moon (2029 is their current goal)\n\n\\- SpaceX will have people on Mars (2029 is the current date set by Elon)\n\n\\- AstroForge will have fully begun its asteroid mining operations\n\n\\- Europa Clipper will be at Europa; Dragonfly will be en route to Titan; a Uranus orbiter is in the works\n\nWhat I think will actually happen by 2030:\n\n\\- As we all know, timelines, especially those set by ambitious tech companies, are more aspirational than they are real. However, of the LEO stations mentioned, the ISS and Tiangong will obviously still be around, (ISS goes down in 2031). Axiom's been making amazing progress, so they'll probably meet or come close to their 2027 timeline for a station. Not much has been made public about Nanoracks' Starlab station, though they've got a 2027 timeline so I'll be nice and give them a 75% chance at making 2030. Orbital Reef's complicated because Blue Origin so secretive about New Glenn's progress, so we really don't have much to go off of, so I'll say they've got a 60% shot at making 2030. And I have no f\\*cking clue what the Russians are doing besides the fact that they said they want their own station in orbit soon so idk 50%.\n\n\\- The Artemis program's already been ripe with delays, and that's unlikely to stop, given just how bloated and bureaucratic the SLS program is. However, my guess is the Artemis II is done via SLS, and then when a new administration comes in in 2025, SLS gets the boot, and enter Starship full time, (this is inevitable, why else would they pick it for HLS?). I'll say Artemis III lands in late 2026 or early 2027, and by 2030 the base in its beginning stages. As for China, I think they'll land in \\~2035.\n\n\\- Elon loves his ambitious timelines, but, this time he's got a reason to be ambitious. Starship is very close to its first orbital flight test this month, and from there its a pretty straight forward path. SpaceX will work with NASA in developing HLS for the Moon, and the design for Mars will pretty much be that with large fins and of course heat shields; (fun fact, Mars is the only world in the solar system where parachutes won't suffice for a landing on their own, but where you also need heat shielding). That aside, even though Starship's seen such great progress, I'm still gonna say 2031 or 2033 for a human landing, because shit happens.\n\n\\- For the asteroid mining thing, I know I'm gonna get a lot of skepticism for this one, and I get it, asteroid mining's tough. But AstroForge is a really good operation, better than Planetary Resources or DSI. They've already got $13M in seed funding and two precursor missions planned for THIS YEAR. And as for the outer solar system NASA missions, I don't see why we should expect any delays for those either.",

        "text": "Reposting from r/Astronomy\n\nI'm interested in the factors that affect planetary mass loss. I'm well aware a host of interacting factors dictate the rate at which planets lose their mass (e.g., jeans escape, planet composition, orbit, host star, and so on). However, I'm particularly interested in which factor -- aspects of the planet itself (it's composition, it's gravitational pull, and so forth) or aspects of the star the planet orbits/ the distance to that star -- have a different degree of impact on planetary mass loss. Is one factor much more important than the other? Apologies if this isn't the best group for this question.",
