Just wondering how strong dorry and brogy really are though, even though we saw them that early in the story we only saw them fight each other and blow a hole through a sea king with ikoku sovereignty(which was the cherry on top of that awesome island). Think they use haki? and if so what kinds? clearly they‚Äôre extremely strong since shanks is asking them for help to hold back kidd but are they potential top tier pirates? in their prime they said they were an extremely strong pirate crew but just how strong?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, this is gonna be a character/themes analysis of One Piece and Luffy using Kung Fu Panda 1's narrative to possibly speculate how this series will advance using this plot thread\n\n**First, how the two parallel each other:**  \n\n\nAt the beginning of Kung Fu Panda 1, we're introduced to the concept of the Dragon Warrior as this invincible master of kung fu, capable of anything and everything. There's a ceremony held on to announce who the Dragon Warrior is and as we find out\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oxdb0xhx5ka1.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=75f0adf529a85974f46c1207292478c802dedf88\n\nIt's Po, our fat, clumsy, idiotic main character, with Master Oogway stating \"how interesting.\".  \n\n\nSimilarly, we find out about Joy Boy on Fishmen Island and we're told that he was meant to raise Noah but broke his promise, as well as being a key figure in the Void Century.  \n\n\nThe similarities between the two is that both are figures set up to be neigh legendary, yet both are bestowed to two seemingly inappropriate figures. Po being the Dragon Warrior, and Luffy being Joy Boy.  \n\n\n**What this could mean for One Piece:**  \n\n\nSkipping to the end of the movie, the big reveal of it is the contends of the scroll:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5anja7tyy5ka1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a3658e7cfaf696fe2a9e0269d72fdde5f86d43c\n\nThroughout the movie, we were told that only the Dragon Warrior could open the scroll and yet we finally see it's contends, there's nothing. Just the reflection of the reader.   \n\n\nAs the movie makes it obvious, the Dragon Warrior \"doesn't exist\", in the sense that it's nothing more than a fancy title, without any special sauce to it. The ultimate message of the movie is that what makes you different makes you unique, and that if you put the hard work in and believe in yourself, you can be someone worthy of being called the Dragon Warrior.  \n\n\nBut now you're probably gonna think that the same case can't be made for Joy Boy, which to that I raise you this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ev745qrz5ka1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e09d81a4c653cd0df4453bbbe4ef263c0c8941ec\n\nKyros in the colosseum was made into this seemingly godly and legendary figure, inspiring the prisoners to be just like him.  \n\n\nAt the beginning we're told that he never existed, only to find out that that's not the case, and that he was simply another man just like every other gladiator.  \n\n\nJoy Boy could've similarly been a case such as Kyros, that of a regular man being turned to legend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdc174ih06ka1.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e5d1a2e267780ee85fba7aff95ab9df0e7a68cf9\n\nKaido says \"either\", meaning there could've potentially been millions of Joy Boy \"candidates\" he tested himself only to find \"unworthy\".   \n\n\nLike Kyros, try to look into Joy Boy in a less idealized way:  \n\n\n1. He made a promise that he couldn't keep  \n\n2. He was a key figure in the war in the Void Century, only to lose\n\nDespite the clear fear the Gorosei show of him, there's nothing to really idolize Joy Boy aside from how people talk about him, like the Fishmen and Zunesha did.  \n\n\nEven Luffy's fruit, which Zunesha said \"Joy Boy is back\" when he awakened, doesn't seem like anything special if you look at it objectively. It only really makes Luffy's rubbery properties more \"rubbery\", if that makes sense.  \n\n\nThe only thing I can't really argue against is that the Poneglyphs said that Joy Boy would return in 800 years, which lines up with the current storyline. Perhaps it could've been a lucky guess but I won't stay on this too much.  \n\n\n**Why this could be the case:**  \n\n\nOne Piece's themes have never been those of \"fate\" or \"reincarnation\" but instead, of Inherited Will and passing of the torch. There has never been a case of \"someone becoming great because it was foretold\", nor of people having second comings.\n\n  \nEven this infamous panel doesn't contradict this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7ua5b4i36ka1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f4a3ae58d1d249793c55139ede255a25b3bc0279\n\nDestiny and fate, despite being synonyms, have always had a slightly different meaning. Destiny means \"something that will inevitably happen in the future, sometimes inevitably\" while fate, although still the same, is something predetermined by a higher power, aka God.  \n\n\nThe reason the two words still persist and coexist is because destiny can be molded by a person, without the need of a higher power, while fate is inevitable and unchanging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we know from Ohara, it doesn't matter how much someone tries to erase history, the truth will always persist.   \n\n\nLuffy could've inherited Joy Boy's will and ultimately fulfill the promises he left behind, all because that's just who he is. Luffy didn't become Joy Boy because of reincarnation, or because he was the chosen one, but because he was who he was a person.  \n\n\nBecoming Joy Boy itself potentially doesn't hold any meaning, like how Kung Fu Panda tells us anyone could be the Dragon Warrior, anyone could've been Joy Boy. The only reason it ended being Luffy is because of his personality, not some predetermined thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can even draw parallels between the potential thousands of previous Gomu-Gomu no mi users and Kung Fu Panda 1's main antagonist:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aluc6tcy76ka1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0f791d25e0af62ec66a89e43c6a37e50d69fcbf2\n\nTai Lung in the movie couldn't become the Dragon Warrior solely because he didn't believe in himself, that he needed some \"magic sauce\" to be a great kung fu warrior, while Po did because he believed in his own abilities.   \n\n\nSimilarly, the reason all those previous users couldn't had been the ones to become Joy Boy because they didn't fulfill some criteria, that potentially being wanting to liberate the whole world without the want or need to control anything in return, which is why Luffy was the only one to succeed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**   \n\n\n\"Joy Boy\" could very likely be nothing more than a title that doesn't mean anything nor give anything to it's holder, in reality being a role Luffy just so happened to fulfill by accident. \n\nI hope you all enjoyed this analysis! I put a lot of thought into it, so I appreciate if you took the time to read it.",

So now extrapolating from that Luffy fights the person in command of Mihawk‚Äôs crew.\n\nTherefore, by facts and logic, The final fight for One Piece is going to be Monkey D Luffy vs Buggy D clown.",

The Reverie arc in One Pace is just 3 episodes long as compared to 12 episodes in the original anime.  \n\n\nSo I guess people who watched Reverie arc using One Pace and have also read the manga too will be best suited to answer this question",

        "text": "(Spoilers for chapter 1076 ahead)\n\n\nNow that Kidd is at Elbaf, all the pieces of the Chess board are coming into play.\n\nFor the longest time I thought how the hell would Zoro fight Ben Beckman when their respective crews eventually clash, considering the fact that Zoro is a swordsman and Beck is a gun user. Yes, I know that Luffy vs Shanks has this same issue of puncher vs Swordsman, but you know that Luffy has been fighting a variety of enemies since East Blue with various fightimg styles. His ultimate weakness has been sharp objects, so it will be awesome seeing him overcome that weakness at Elbaf.\nComing back to Beck, I think its clear that Kidd will be the one fighting him. At the time of the writing of this theory, Chapter 1076 just came out, and its been implied that Beck was the one who cut off Kidd's hand,and he holds a grudge against him for that. This means Kidd will take on Beck.\nAs for Sanji, he will solo Lucky Roux. Both of them have speed as their gimmick.\nUssop will have his reunion and fight with Yassop.\nAs for Zoro...? Well, lets wait for it.\n\nNow, how does this all fit together?\nCurrently, Kidd is about to fight Shanks. My bet is that Kidd will realise that he cannot take on Shanks one-on-one, and instead challenge him for a DAVY BACK FIGHT. They will fight over their poneglyphs. Now, obviously this game takes a lot of setup. Being a Yonko crew, Shanks' allies will probably take a whole day to set up this game.\nIn the meantime, Luffy and friends will escape Egghead and reunite with Kidd and Shanks, where Luffy will reforge his alliance with Kidd. \nUssop vs Yassop\nSanji vs Lucky Roux\nKidd vs Beck\nLuffy vs Shanks\nThis leaves Zoro....\n\n\nHere comes Buggy.\n\n\nMy speculation is that Cross Guild will reach Elbaf as well, for reasons I currently cannot guess. But it makes sense. Shanks and Buggy had vowed ti reach the One Piece, and if Luffy really does find the last Road Poneglyph here, then it makes sense for them to accompany him. Afterall, when Luffy defeats Shanks, he will consider Luffy his superior,  the worthy heir to the One Piece and Roger's legacy. \n\nAnd accompanying Buggy will be Mihawk. Mihawk will takw on Zoro, and Zoro will emerge victorious. Obviously their are flaws in this theory. For one, if Zoro reaches Yonko level in this arc, wont it make it impossible for Shiryu to fight him when their respective crews do eventually clash? \n\nThis makes me think that maybe Kidd will indeed be defeated by Shanks, and in the Davy Back Fight, Zoro will fight Beck. Now how will a fight between gun and sword go? Idk, but interestingly,  it has always been believed that gun is superior to sword. Maybe Zoro will break that obstacle using his skills against Beck. \n\nNow then, what about Kidd?\n\nEven if we take Benn out of this equation, that still leaves a MAJOR antagonist for Kidd...\n\nBig Mom has a strong connection with the real world King Napoleon. Even her sword is named after him. Napoleon lost his kingdom after losing the Battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo,  and in One Piece BM gets beaten by Trafalgar D. Water Law. \nBut do you know where Napoleon is exiled after losing his kingdom?\nAt a place called Elba!\n\nSo yeah, Big Mom is probably going to Elbaf. She had declared how she would come to take revenge on Law and Kidd, and probably she will try to do that at Elbaf. Maybe here Kidd will become a fully fledged Emperor. Who knows.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it.\n\nShanks at Elbaf.\nKidd at Elbaf.\nLuffy at Elbaf.\nBM at Elbaf.\n\nThis will be one heck of an arc if executed correctly, and I believe Oda will deliver.\n\nNow some pure speculation :\n\nI think another Yonko might be coming to Elbaf as well, even after we take Cross Guild out of the equation.\n\nBefore the story ends, aren't Blackbeard and Shanks supposed to have a rematch as well?",

        "text": "Rockstar has the teleport teleport fruit.Specifically he has the return return fruit.I believe his fruit allows him to mark either an object or a person as his \"return\" and he can port himself to his mark.I also believe he awakened this fruit which allows him to bring others around him to his [mark.It](https://mark.It) could also be called the tour tour fruit(as a pun on his name of Rock Star)\n\nproof :\n\n1)He is a new member of the red haired pirates yet was trusted with bringing a message alone to whitebeard and now recently kidd(who they have beef with as is known to be violent)\n\n2)He has not displayed any high level diplomacy skills or combat skills and his bounty is only 94,000,00 which is low for a yonko crew member.These make him ill suited to act as a messenger since he can't defend himself or talk his way out of it(he wanted to fight whitebeard until shanks talked him down which proves hes not a great diplomat)\n\n3)It explains how the red haired pirates where able to make it to marineford after clashing with kaido in a short time(rockstar marked someone who stayed behind near marineford then rockstar returned the crew to him after they dealt with kaido\n\n4)He was already a famous pirate with a different pirate crew before he joined the red haired pirates(He was recruited by shanks directly for his fruit)\n\n5) Might also explain how shanks visited the gorosei alone since at the first sign of trouble he could contact rockstar who could port the crew to shanks,and If his fruit allows him to mark multiple targets he could then port the entire crew out.",
