        "text": "YouTube is, of course, a goldmine of bad history.  My personal favourite: [*What if the Black Death wiped out Europe?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYwXLpBpfI)(spoilers: the Muslims take over and are unable to advance their tech tree).  However, I recently came across a video on a subject I feel qualified to speak on: the Russian Civil War.  It’s a video that’s better than most in YouTube’s history department, but still kind of baffling.  The offending channel is ‘The Cynical Historian’ (the word cynical seems redundant to me, but whatever) with his video [*The Russian Intervention (1918-1920) | Wars you've never heard of*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mC1bmzbgxY).  It’s an introduction to the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War, a subject The Cynical Historian calls ‘kind of [his] most studied subject in history’.  I was disappointed though, when his video failed to grasp what I believe to be certain realities of the intervention.  The three minor things I took issue with were: the reasons for the intervention, the very nature of the Allies’ involvement, and how it ended.\n\n\nFirst of all, Mr. Cynical is pretty brief on the reasons behind the intervention, which is fair enough.  It would be a lot to tackle in a 6 minute video, but I think he has omitted some important details.  I will say that I fully agree with his description of what happened as ‘convoluted’.  A cohesive policy on Russia, the Allies did not have.  I think the problem with this video is that is massively understates the anti-German reasons behind intervention.  While the First World War was still going on, the primary goal of the Allies in Russia was to prevent Germany making gains there (like capturing munitions caches or building an arctic U-boat base).  While there were Allied leaders who could not stand the thought of a Soviet state (e.g. Churchill and John Foster Dulles), there were others who were, shall we say, not quite as zealous (Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour, Woodrow Wilson).  Of course, after November 1918, justifications for further intervention were strictly anti-Bolshevik, but when intervention first came about, the priority was winning the war in Europe.  I wonder if CH has heard of the village of Pechenga where, in May 1918, British Marines and Red Guards fought on the same side to repel an incursion by White Finns?  Like I said, the priority was keeping out Germany, with or without the Bolsheviks’ help.\n\n\nAround the 2:45 mark is where I begin to doubt Cynical History Man’s claim of this being his most researched subject.  He says: ‘by July 1918 a full invasion was mounted in Russia’.  This is all wrong.  The first British troops arrived in March at Murmansk, the day after the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.  I’ll admit this was only a token force, but the more significant landings happened in August.  My real beef with this statement is the phrase ‘full invasion’.  When I think ‘full invasion’ of Russia I think of hundreds of thousands of soldiers heading for Moscow, not 15,000 or so scattered around the North and Siberia.  Speaking of which, saying ‘we took … all of Siberia’ is further evidence for my ‘CH has wildly overstated the extent of his research’ theory.  The Allied forces in Siberia were not some conquering army sweeping through, liberating towns as they went.  Much of Siberia was controlled by non-Soviet governments, the people the Allies were meant to be supporting.  Also, the Allied forces were mainly centred around Vladivostok and defending the thousands of miles of railways in the region.  They were not a cohesive invasion force as the video implies.\n\n\n\nFinally, Dr. Cynic has branded the intervention as a ‘defeat’ of the Allies.  ‘The commies beat us back’.  What?  By most accounts the fledgling Red Army were not even close to a match for the Allied troops.  Take General Ironside’s assault on the Dvina Front in August 1919, an offensive that (according to Ironside’s account) went swimmingly, *while he was preparing to evacuate*.  The withdrawal from Russia was not a military defeat of the Allies.  It was a result of a lack of cohesions, a war weariness in Europe, and an increasingly stronger Soviet government.  Calling this a ‘defeat’ is incredibly misleading.\n\n\nLook, I know this is a massively complex subject, and there is still more to be written on it, but this video just misses the mark after a fairly promising start.  The acknowledgement of the lack of unity over Russia among the Allied leadership was a nice touch but it quickly fell apart from there.  The Russian Civil War will never be an easy subject to study for many reasons, but Cynical Historian has proved about as reliable as the Omsk Government.\n\ntl;dr - YouTube historians are a bit shit",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/86jw4u/bill_warner_compares_crusades_to_jihads_and_fails/",
        "text": "Hello fellow Historians! Today I’ll be analyzing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_To-cV94Bo) posted by Bill Warner of the Political Islam channel. Bill Warner, who does have a PHD but it’s in physics and mathematics so it’s basically irrelevant to any discussion of Islamic history, claims to be an expert on Islam and has written several books on Islam and also makes inaccurate Youtube videos about Islamic history. By far Bill Warner’s most popular video is Jihad vs Crusades, in which warner attempts to show on a “dynamic battle map” all the locations of battles waged in a jihad and every battle done in a crusade and compare them on the map. This video has over one million views and a reupload has another million views so I think it's important to point out the misinformation in Warner’s video. Warner provides no sources for most of the info he provides in the video and if he were a PHD in history or a related field to what he’s discussing that’d probably be fine, but he has no background in history so he really should be citing where he gets his information.\n\n My first issue with the video is the map and what areas are shaded green. What is the green supposed to mean? The video never says what the green is supposed to be but it can be assumed that the shading is meant to indicate areas under muslim rule (since that’s the only explanation that makes any sense) but that leaves us with several massive inaccuracies. I’ll highlight a few of them along with screenshots taken from the video. There are obviously many more issues with the map than what I've listed here but these were some of the biggest errors I noticed.\n\n[Map 720-740](https://imgur.com/RdIufqj) In this screenshot there is no green shown in Iberia when the muslim conquest of the Visigothic kingdom was well underway and the Umayyads had subjugated areas as far North as the Pyrenees by 717. None of this is shown on the map \n\n[Map 900-920](https://imgur.com/tWXIpne) In this screenshot the map is updated for 900 A.D yet Sicily is not shaded green at all despite the fact that muslims had conquered nearly the entire island by 902 A.D.\n\n[Map 1320-1340](https://imgur.com/DdB8MuG) This screenshot was taken just as the video updated the green to show 1320 however it still shows the Moors owning all of Iberia as far North as Burgos. This is painfully inaccurate as King Fernando III (1201A.D-1252A.D) had reclaimed lands as far South as Seville by the end of his reign. There is no excuse for the map to be updated to show 1320 and not include a conquest that had taken place in 1248. \n\n[Map 1520-1540](https://imgur.com/WECKh7t) After the map has been updated for 1520 you can see that Sardinia and Sicily are shaded green underneath all those red dots. This is absolutely baffling to me as I cannot figure out why anyone would firstly mark Sicily as Muslim ruled in the 16th century as it was owned by Spain. And secondly, why Sicily is suddenly green in the 16th century when it was owned by Spain, instead of green in the 10th century when it was ruled by muslims. This makes literally no sense!\n\n[Map 1800-1820](https://imgur.com/bay1pTG) In the map’s last update for the year 1800 A.D we can clearly see that nearly the entire West coast of India is shown to be under muslim rule. This is incorrect as large parts of India were ruled by Hindus and the British by that point. \n\nNow we finally get to the main focus of the video; the battles. Despite what Crusader kings 2 would tell us, comparing Jihads and Crusades is already a bad comparison because they’re very different things. However because it’s the entire premise of the video I’ll overlook that. Also, what Bill Warner labels as a battle ranges from small skirmishes (which is what the majority of the dots in Iberia would be) to massive battles involving tens of thousands of soldiers. There is no distinguishing between these two massively different types of military engagement on the map as both are only represented by a single red dot. However, the primary issue I have with the map is that Warner uses a very narrow definition of crusade. Warner stops marking battles for the crusades at 1260 A.D, which is totally wrong. Crusades did not only happen in the Middle east and they were waged long after 1260. Warner seems to leave out every crusade after the Third Crusade which is simply baffling. There were several more crusades after the Third Crusade, they weren’t all as large as the third crusade but they were still crusades. Some of the crusades that Warner misses are the Northern Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, the Bosnian Crusade, the Hussite Wars, and every crusade in between the Fourth Crusade and the Ninth Crusade. But maybe to play devil’s advocate we’ll assume that Warner means to only display crusades against Muslims. But if that were the case he still completely missed all 700 years of the Reconquista as well as the Crusade of Varna. \n\t\nWhile Warner uses a very narrow definition of Crusade, his definition of jihad is far too broad to draw any meaningful comparison to the crusades. In his video description Warner provides a list of what battle corresponds to each red dot signifying that a battle which was part of a Jihad. I can’t fact check all 542 entries on the list (because even i have limits on what I’m willing to sift through) but I can say without a doubt that it’s heavily padded with battles that are irrelevant to any comparison between jihads and crusades. For example the Bosnian War is listed as a Jihad, even though it happened in the 1990’s and muslim Bosniaks had a genocide committed against them in that war. Some other notable examples of Warner padding his list with conflicts that were definitely not comparable to the crusades in any meaningful way include the Kosovo War, The Barbary Wars, The Castilian conquest of Granada, The First Crusade (Battles won by muslims are listed as Jihads even if they were defending), and the capture of Lisbon by the Portuguese. Many of the battles and wars that Warner lists as “Jihad battles” are wars in which muslims were defending against Christian invasions and many of his listed battles are from civil wars within Muslim nations. Based on a few of the sources he lists (though most of his sources link to web pages that don’t exist) it seems like Warner went to a webpage with the title “list of wars in the muslim world” and just added every conflict he saw in that list. Warner is careful in the video to make sure he is able to list any conflict muslims engaged in as jihad, making no distinction between whether the muslims were conquering territory or defending their own, while he specifies that the battles he lists for crusades would only be those in which Christians were the aggressors. This is done to give viewers a false impression of Islamic history as uniquely violent.\n\nSo far the only thing I’ve corrected are Warner’s visuals and his self-made sources but I’d also like to point out a couple of issues with the things he says in the video as well. Warner says the battles are “primarily against the classical civilisations of Rome and Greece” which is weird statement because by the time Islam emerged the Western Roman Empire had collapsed and the Eastern Roman Empire was dominated by Greeks so I’m not sure why he’d say Rome and Greece except to make it sound like Islam was a few centuries older than it really is. Also most of the battles Warner shows on the map aren’t against the Eastern Roman Empire so his previous statement is false. Bill Warner also has a tendency to say statements like “the navy of Islam” which make it sound like every muslim nation just used one big collective fleet,which was not the case, instead of each nation having their own navy. I also cannot find a source for Bill’s statement that “it was traditional that when the Sultan came to power, the brand new Sultan, he would immediately try to launch new wars” so I’m going to assume he made that up unless someone on this sub knows a source for that, in which case I’d be glad to hear about it. Bill incorrectly says that the reconquista in Spain lasted for 400 years when in reality it was closer to 700. And contrary to what Bill would have you believe, all of the Crusades were not defensive wars. Even if we were to buy into Bill’s theory that the crusades were a response to muslim expansion then that still doesn’t explain how the Albigensian Crusade or the Hussite Wars were defensive. This same argument applies to Bill’s statement that the Crusades were to liberate Christians, as the motivation behind the Albigensian Crusade and the Hussite Wars was not to free Christians from oppression but to convert heretics. \n\nAlso just as a fun aside, Bill Warner puts these testimonials on his website (under his Press Kit section if any of you are curious) to try to prove his credibility in the study of Islam. These include quotes from a retired Major General, an ex-muslim, and a guy who runs an anti-muslim website. However the most interesting of these testimonials comes from a guy named Kevin who says “Every word he (Bill Warner) said is very true, I read the Quran in Arabic. Mr Warner tells the real story about Islam.”. No last name is given for Kevin and no credentials are given so now I’m stuck here wondering just who is Kevin?!? [Could this be Kevin?](https://imgur.com/cauBlh3)\n\nSo in conclusion, Bill Warner’s video is complete garbage. It’s designed to draw a direct comparison between jihads and crusades but fails to represent either accurately and is just a sad attempt to trick people into having a negative view of Islamic history. It’s actually really sad that Bill Warner describes himself as an expert on Islam and dedicates so much of his time to discussing it yet has such obvious disdain for Islamic beliefs, culture, and history.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed doing the research for it! I hope you all have a wonderful day!\n",

        "text": "There's no easy way to put this, so I'm just gonna go out and say it: people are morons. I've literally been sitting in front of my computer for several minutes trying to come up with some clever opening line that encapsulates the point I'm trying to make in some grandiose, literary way when I could've just saved myself the time and effort and just out and say that people are morons, and morons are dangerous. In some cases, it only takes one moron to destroy political systems, nations, even civilizations. They just have to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nI know I sound like a bit of an asshole saying this, but when we see morons, we need to call them out. Let it be known that they are what they are, and should not be trusted - at least until they stop being morons. Nip them in the bud. Hence, this post.\n\nI was motivated to write this after I stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn7QBMOyC_0) on Youtube called \"Did the Parties Switch?\" It's a relatively small video, with about 77,000 views as of time of writing, from a relatively small channel with about 32,000 subs to its name. Normally, this wouldn't be cause for alarm. However, the video in question is only just shy of being five months old, and is the channel's inaugural video - meaning this channel has accrued over 30,000 subs in less than five months from nothing. It's growing fast, and, if it isn't called out, I'm afraid it may be making the rounds on this subreddit a little more often in the near future.\n\nBut anyway, on to the video in question. As can be inferred from the title, the video tackles what the narrator calls at 0:07, \"The Great American Political Party Switch\", or, \"The Switch that Never Happened\" as the narrator later suggests at 0:20. A political paradigm shift that anybody who has read up at all on their history will know as the\"Southern Realignment\".\n\nBroadly speaking, the Southern Realignment was a process which [flipped political support in the American South from Democrats to Republicans](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/19/us/gop-tries-hard-to-win-black-votes-but-recent-history-works-against-it.html), whose Presidential Candidates have held the region comfortably from the 1970s until now. The opinion of many historians is that this realignment was due in large part to the Republican's use of the 'Southern Strategy', or, the [targeting of racist whites in the south by demonizing blacks](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/17/archives/nixons-southern-strategy-its-all-in-the-charts.html). The Southern Strategy is... controversial, within certain conservative circles (its mere mention [will get you banned](https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/2ypllz/the_southern_strategy_myth/) from r/conservative - I'll get back to that later)\n\nAnyway, back to the \"Great American Political Party Switch That Never Happened\". At 0:58, the narrator claims the two prongs of the 'myth' are \"1) Whites in the South who used to vote Democrat now vote Republican, and 2) Blacks who used to vote Republican now vote Democrat.\" There's a bit of a problem with that second point though. While it is often assumed that, since there was a switch, and black people by and large vote Democrat now, they must have therefore voted Republican before. This is only half-true. While the pre-New Deal Democrats weren't friends of black people, neither were Republicans. Don't just take my word for it though, the [official history and archives website for the House of Representatives says as much](http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Temporary-Farewell/Party-Realignment/), stating:\n\n&gt; African-American leaders at the national level began to abandon their loyalty to the GOP. While the party’s political strategy of creating a competitive wing in the postwar South was not incompatible with the promotion of black civil rights, by the 1890s party leaders were in agreement that this practical political end could not be achieved without attracting southern whites to the ticket. “Equalitarian ideals,” explains a leading historian, “had to be sacrificed to the exigencies of practical politics.”\n\n\n&gt; At its 1926 national convention, the NAACP pointedly resolved, “Our political salvation and our social survival lie in our absolute independence of party allegiance in politics and the casting of our vote for our friends and against our enemies whoever they may be and whatever party labels they carry.”\n\nIt wasn't that black people voted for Republicans, they just voted for whoever wasn't in favor of lynch mobs. Interestingly enough, the narrator of the video argues a similar line of thought, pointing to black voting trends in the early 1930s at 1:23 which display a distinct siding with Democrats post-New Deal. However, rather than point out how this pertains to Southern Realignment - or that showing black people in support of Democrats might invalidate his claim of the \"Great American Political Party Switch\" being the \"Switch That Never Happened\" - the narrator instead goes on a tangent about how the New Deal is racist, Democrats brainwashed black people into voting for them, and free market economics are the way to go for the next 2 minutes and 10 seconds - of an 8 minute video. Although, to be fair, spending a substantial amount of time going on a tangent to propagate your ideology is a hallmark of badhistory.\n\nWhen the narrator gets back on topic - sort of - at 3:53, he claims that President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act, was \"well known for saying this exact quote among his peers: 'I'll have those niggers voting Democrat for the next 200 years.' And this one he said when he appointed Judge Marshall to the Supreme Court: 'Son, when I appoint a nigger to the Supreme Court, I want everyone to know he's a nigger.'\" While the second quote does have some sourcing behind it, the first quote has come under heavy fire. Contrary to what the narrator says, it has not been \"well-documented\", in fact, it might have never been said. The quote originates from Ronald M. MacMillan, a former Air Force One steward [whose accuracy and reliability has come into question](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lbj-voting-democratic/). He made several claims about LBJ and his family which have been denied, uncorroborated, or in some cases run counter to historical evidence - that quote being one of them (as [private recordings exist showing LBJ to genuinely believe in Civil Rights](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lbj-voting-democratic/), despite being a bit of a casual racist). But, hey, why let a few facts get in the way of a good ideological spouting?\n\nAt 4:29, over halfway through the video, the narrator finally tackles the actual issue of Southern Realignment - why Democrats lost the South and Republicans won it. The narrator points out that \"this trend of whitey starting to vote Republican begins occurring well over a decade before the Civil Rights Act even passed, as industry from the North began moving south and upholstering all the agrarian industries and creating new cities and suburbs, the people living in those regions started voting more Republican. They were having some economic prosperity and voted for more free-trade economics.\"\n\nWoo boy, is there a lot to unpack here. First of all, yes, the trend of the South voting more Republican does have its roots in the 50s, but it wasn't due to Southerners becoming richer. There are two main factors, the first of which is the Second Great Migration, wherein [over 5 million African-Americans from the South moved north](http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm;jsessionid=f8301648211521663951690?migration=9&amp;topic=1&amp;bhcp=1) and west to more economically viable areas. This resulted in, unsurprisingly, fewer black people in the South, giving more power to racist whites. Secondly, it wasn't that industry from the north moved South and made everyone richer and therefore more Republican, rather, the South became richer beforehand, which attracted Northerners to migrate south. Consequently, the states with the most Northerners ended up being more likely to vote Republican (according to James L. Sundquist in *Dynamics of the Party System: Alignment and Realignment of Political Parties in the United States*)\n\nAt 5:31 the narrator states \"White racists... who were rooted in the Deep South, never switched [parties]. They were Democrats until the day they died.\" This is demonstrably untrue. As can be seen in [this map of the 1964 election](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1964) between Lyndon B. Johnson (D) and Barry Goldwater (R), Goldwater won all the traditional states of the 'Deep South', and nothing else (save Arizona). This was the [first time since 1876](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1876) that a Republican carried a Deep South state. If the narrator is to be believed that racist white Democrats didn't switch parties, then that would require all the racist whites in the Deep South to either die within the span of ten years or never vote again after 1964. Considering we're talking about the 50s/60s, when practically every white citizen of the Deep South was racist, that'd be a hell of a feat (hyperbole, obviously).\n\nThe last two minutes of the video are just the narrator pointing at various racist democrats from the era, including Strom Thurmond at 6:24 (noting how he was the only \"Congressman\" to defect to the Republicans - oblivious to the fact that he was actually a Senator) Al Gore, Sr. at 6:36 (noting how he took part in a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act) and Robert Byrd at 6:52 (noting how he was a former Klansman). I was actually going to skip over this bit in my write-up, because it's not really relevant, but then something came up.\n\nRemember when I said I would get back to that thing about r/conservative? Well, when linking to [that post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/2ypllz/the_southern_strategy_myth/), I noticed the mod did his own little write-up about the Southern Strategy and how it's a 'myth'. In said write-up, the mod brought up four examples of racist Democrats. Three of whom happen to be Strom Thurmond, Al Gore, Sr., and Robert Byrd. Not only that, but similar points are raised about the three men: Strom Thurmond was the only Democrat in the Senate (at least the mod got that right) to defect, Al Gore, Sr. voted against the Civil Rights Act and Robert Byrd was a former Klansman. Considering the fact that said mod's source is no longer available, that leaves me with two options: A) most arguments against the Southern Strategy invoke the same irrelevant ad hominems, representing a lack of substantive points, or B) the maker of the video read that post on r/conservative and copied those points down. For some reason I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\nAnyway, to finish the video off, the narrator announces at 7:35 that \"there's a lot more to this issue that I'll cover in another video regarding the Southern Strategy.\" It's been almost five months since he posted that video, and he hasn't posted that video on the Southern Strategy yet (although he has found the time to make other videos with titles like \"Hillary Rigged the Election\" and \"PizzaGate Explained\") so I'll just pre-emptively defend the Southern Strategy's existence here (because I know he's going to claim it doesn't exist - and if he doesn't, then I'll edit in an apology for being presumptuous).\n\nMany people (the mods of r/conservative included) have tried to discredit or outright deny the Southern Strategy's existence essentially because it means that Republicans have, since the 1960s, sought to use racist dogwhistling and policies to maintain a grip on power. The greatest evidence we have for the existence of such a strategy is, you know, people claiming to create and use it. Take Kevin Phillips for example, [one of Richard Nixon's 1968 election strategists and pioneers of the Southern Strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/17/archives/nixons-southern-strategy-its-all-in-the-charts.html) who told a New York Times Magazine reporter in 1970 that:\n\n&gt; From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.\n\nEdit: Cleared up some language",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI-Z-cwPrU8\n\nA friend of mine who I play World of Warships with linked me this video thinking that I'd find it interesting. I did, but not for the reasons he probably expected.\n\nSo this is a video from The Infographics Show comparing two World War II battleships, the Imperial Japanese Navy's *Yamato* and the American *USS Iowa.* This is a comparison that's been made over and over by naval historians and buffs of WWII at sea over the years, and the badhistory here isn't really in the comparisons they make/conclusions they come to, it's more that the video is just awfully researched. FWIW, I give the advantage to *Iowa,* because USN fire control's nothing to scoff at.\n\nFirst off, you need to know that Wargaming sponsored this video. This doesn't normally mean anything bad - in fact one of Wargaming's in-house guys, Nick Moran, does really excellent historical work. He goes by Chieftain and if you're into armor at all you'll be familiar with his work on the Sherman tank.\n\nAt 0:48, the narrator says that they'll be comparing *Yamato* and *Iowa* with ship graphics on the screen. These are both of aircraft carriers. We're off to a good start.\n\n0:52, the narrator goes into the sponsored bit and talks about World of Warships. He then talks about the \"historical accuracy\" of the game (I'll tell you this, there really isn't any) and then talks about the \"iconic warships\" in the game, such as *HMS Monarch* and *HMS Iron Duke.* So... about that. *Iron Duke* is perhaps well known to naval historians for being Admiral Jellicoe's flagship at Jutland, but she's not exactly *iconic,* in the way that the titular ships or something like *Bismarck* or *Hood* are iconic. What's worse is *Monarch.* The most well-known *Monarch* is probably the 1868 ship famous for having her guns mounted in turrets, but this vessel is not in the game. In-game, *Monarch* is a bastardized *King George V* class ship with bigger guns, not particularly historical at all.\n\n2:15 Again we’ve got what’s clearly a CV (looks vaguely like a Kiev-class) labeled as a battleship.\n\n2:25, the narrator says “All modern navies only have destroyers in use.” Infographics should probably know that since they started the fucking video talking about aircraft carriers that this isn’t the case. They could possibly be referring to surface combatants, but even this is untrue - many navies have Frigates, Cruisers, and other types of non-CV vessel still in service. This is confirmed by a cursory wikipedia search.\n\n2:38 “Other than *Yamato,* contenders for top tier BBs include *Bismarck,* *Mikasa,* and *HMS Victory.*” I don’t think any serious commentator thinks *Bismarck* is on the same tier as *Iowa* or *Yamato.* *Bismarck* was bloated, heavily overweight, and possessed an outdated armor scheme more suitable to Jutland than any modern naval engagement. She's only so famous because she blasted a World War One era battlecruiser with a reputation.\n\n2:43 - This is the most ahistorical claim so far: “*Yamato,* built in the Yamato province of Japan...” HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Yamato was built in Kure. Yamato Province doesn’t even exist anymore, being part of what’s now Nara Prefecture. It was also completely landlocked, so I don’t think we’re going to be building massive BBs there.\n\n2:55 “Some people say when she set off to Okinawa it was a suicide mission.” Uhh… That’s because it was? Operation Ten-Go was the plan by which *Yamato* would beach herself on Okinawa and be used as a floating shore battery to shell the American invasion force. It's fairly obvious the Japanese never intended for her to return as she only had just enough fuel to make Okinawa.\n\n3:13 Discussing her sinking, “Until that time, Japan thought her to be invincible.” Well, her sister ship, *Musashi,* had gone down in Leyte Gulf during October of the previous year, so I don’t think anyone in the IJN's high command had these delusions.\n\n3:32: We move on to discussing *Iowa.* “Her first hit came when Japanese projectiles hit turrets two and five.” Iowa has three main gun turrets, not five. This is apparent if you, I don't know, look at the ship.\n\nThe next few minutes discuss the relative advantages of the two ships. There's a lot to go into that they just get wrong and I don't feel like discussing. If you'd like an actual comparison of the two as well as other ships of the period, I recommend John Parshall and Tony Tully's (the guys who wrote *Shattered Sword,* really talented naval authors) comparison on the (admittedly ancient) Combined Fleet page. http://www.combinedfleet.com/baddest.htm\n\n7:31 “Only battleship slugfest that did ever happen was Denmark Strait when Bismarck and Prince EUGENE.” First off. *Prinz Eugen* as Prince Eugene? I know that's the translation but come on. Cringe. \nAlso, REALLY? Okay, so the claim, if you missed it, is that battleships only fought each other one time. This is ludicrous. We'll discount Dogger Bank and Jutland cuz those are WWI, that’s fine. WWII still leaves us with the fight off Lofoten between the twins (German *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau*) and *HMS Renown,* Cape Sparivento, the final battle with *Bismarck,* Casablanca, Second Guadalcanal, the North Cape and Surigao Strait. There are a ton of these, and wikipedia has a page *literally listing battleship engagements.* This is not hard stuff to figure out.\n\nThis is classic badhistory pedantry, and maybe I'm more angry at the shitty video quality than anything else, but this annoyed me so much I wanted to say something.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

South Africa constructed six nuclear weapons, but its nuclear program ended in 1989 still when the country was in white minority rule.

        "text": "Ok, first a little bit of background. James Allsup is the former president of the Republican club at Washington State University who resigned shortly after he was sighted at a white power rally. He identifies himself as “white identitarian” which isn’t the same thing as white supremacy at all... he just thinks that the US should be white only because other races simply aren’t intelligent enough and put a drain on society. So yeah, totally not a nazi. Anyhow, the video was made defending Trumps infamous “shithole” comments about Haiti, and delivering some bad history in the process. Now, he only delves into history for about 30 seconds, but the history was just so terrible I had to pick it apart. \nHere’s the link to the video if you want to kill a few brain cells: [LINK](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XBNNMNT9nTg)\n\nOk so first off:\nAllsup begins by saying that the black population rose up at the start of the 19th century to rebel against the colonial “oppressors”\n\n1)So he puts “oppressors” in quotes for some reason, as if the overwhelming majority of the black population wasn’t enslaved. I think it’s safe to say that most of the black population was oppressed when\n- about 50% of them were dying of yellow fever before a year on the island\n-constantly subjected to sexual abuse and rape\n-subjected to punishments such as whipping, burning, and castration constantly\n\n2) it’s a bit of a blanket statement to say that all of the black population revolted. While slaves did make up 90% of the population on Haiti, a portion of free people were free blacks or mulattos, a mixed race people with white and African parents. Since Haitis economy revolved around plantations, many of these free people of color worked as plantation administrators or even owned slaves themselves. I’m not sure if Allsup isn’t mentioning this because it hurts his narrative that the slaves were some sort of savage revolutionaries or simple ignorance of history, but it’s probably both.\n\n3) Allsup mentions that the slaves massacred a lot of the white population on Haiti. That is true. But what he doesn’t mention is that the surviving white militias also murdered defenseless slaves as an act of revenge. Of course Allsup would never mention this, the slaves are supposed to be the bad guys in this video.\n\n4) Allsup says that by killing the white population , the Haitians were left with nobody who knew anything about building or maintaining a civilization. [I’m just gonna leave this here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture) Louverture is just one example of an African slave that was educated and able to govern a nation pretty effectively, given the circumstances (an idea that Allsup couldn’t even fathom)\n\n6) Allsup concludes this historical abomination by not mentioning \n- The economic embargo placed on Haiti by France and the US, as well as the two countries forcing Haiti to pay millions of francs as reparations for lost slaves\n- the lack of a skilled and educated population. I don’t think the system for educating slaves was particularly stellar, and as a result, Haiti felt the impact\n- during the Revolution, a good portion of the plantations on the island were destroyed, thus destroying the ability to produce Haiti’s livelihood.\n\nIn summary, Allsup basically says “dumb Africans kill smart and just white man and then their country falls apart cuz they’re dumb”. \n",

The Ottomans enslaved primarily white European Christians, so suck it.\n\n&gt; From that moment onward, every major civilization in the world practiced slavery. Until white people said NO, we aren't doing this anymore! We sacrificed 600,000 lives in the civil war for that.\n\n&gt; But you refuse to give us any credit. It seems to me that you are the unreasonable one and I am the good one.\n\nOh my sweet Jesus, this is wrong on so many levels.\n\n1. We have no idea how far back slavery goes, but we *do* know it predates Sumer by several thousand years. It's basically as old as agriculture.\n2. I'm not sure it's really accurate to call Sumer a \"modern civilization,\" given it's one of the oldest known civilizations *period.*\n3. Sumer fell around 1900 BCE. The Ottoman Empire was formed in 1299 CE. Quite a lot of human history happened between those dates.\n4. I'm going to quote the Wikipedia page on slavery here: \"Slavery was known in almost every ancient civilization and society including Sumer, Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, Carolingian Europe, the Roman Empire, the Hebrew kingdoms of the ancient Levant, and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas.\" **All of those** predate the Ottoman Empire.\n5. Nobody has ever claimed the Atlantic slave trade was the beginning of slavery. What made it unique was its scale and extremity.\n6. I can only assume that \"We sacrificed 600,000 lives in the civil war for that\" is a reference to the American civil war, which had very little impact on the *global* abolition of slavery. Furthermore, that number includes people on the side fighting to *continue* slavery.\n7. The only reason white people may have lead the charge on abolition is that, thanks to colonialism, white people were ruling over the vast majority of the planet at the time. On that note:\n8. Toyotomi Hideyoshi banned slavery in Japan in 1590. Over 200 years before any country in Europe would do so. **Edit:** okay, I probably could’ve expressed this one a little better. There were some countries in Europe that had banned slavery before this, but to my knowledge, those bans were either only applicable to white people/Christians or reversed once the whole colonialism thing got popular. I believe this is the oldest existing complete ban on slavery, but I could be wrong about that. And certainly the Imperials didn’t exactly respect it, but it was still banned *de jure* AFAIK.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/84v3vu/disneys_mulan_is_not_an_entirely_accurate/",
        "text": "So I figured after my last post had me digging through some really vile and racist material I’d take a little break and instead make a more light-hearted and fun post about a movie that I really like: Mulan. While it’s obvious that Mulan is set in China the film never actually says when the film is set, however using clues in the script and visuals of the film we can determine what period the film is set in and then we can look at what elements in the film are ahistorical to that period. Hopefully this post can use the film as a vehicle to discuss some aspects of Chinese history that often go unmentioned in Western school curriculum as well as being a fun read.\n\nSo in the film there are big clues, which tell us a lot about when the film is set, and little clues that just give us hints. First I’ll just run through some of the smaller clues that help us tell when the film is not set. The film features a lucky cricket, which tells us that the film is set after 500 BC when the tradition of lucky crickets emerged. We also see some men playing Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) which was developed during the Warring states period that lasted from 475 B.C to 221 B.C. At the training camp we can see examples of steel, paper, and an abacus being used, all of which date back in China to the Han dynasty. We can also see Mulan’s father eating dumplings, which supposedly go back all the way to the Three Kingdoms, which was the time period from 184 AD to 280 AD after the collapse of the Han dynasty. The final little clue we are shown is the use of cannons which utilize gunpowder. Gunpowder was not used for weapons in Chinese history until the Tang dynasty that lasted from 618 AD to 907 AD. With these small hints that more or less just tell us that the story is not set in ancient China out of the way we can look at the larger hints.\n\nThe first big hint we are given comes in the first scene of the movie when the Great Wall is being attacked. The Great Wall (Chang Cheng in Chinese) was originally built during the Qin dynasty by Qin Shi Huang. However that early wall is not the one we are shown in the film. The wall shown in the film is clearly the Ming Great Wall, which was built after the Ming dynasty’s aggressive foreign policy towards the steppe peoples proved to be a complete failure (even resulting in the Zhengtong emperor being captured by Mongols). After this failure to protect their borders the Ming decided to fortify the border and built the Great Wall as we know it today. The state of the Great wall can also be used to tell us what strategic period of the ming dynasty mulan is set in. The first strategic period from 1368 to 1449 was marked by the Ming maintaining an open frontier and little wall building, which would mean that the film cannot have taken place during this period. The film is also unlikely to have been set during the second strategic period, which took place from 1449 to 1540, as it was marked by a shift from an offensive to a defensive policy regarding the steppes and saw little wall building. This means that the film is almost certainly set during the third strategic period, which lasted from 1540 to the end of the Ming dynasty and was marked by the fortification of the Ming borders with the steppes. The film also likely takes place after the late 16th century as this period was when most major construction on the Great Wall occurred and the wall we see in the film appears to be complete.\n\nThe second really big hint is that the film often mentions the “imperial city” and shows us the Meridian Gate. The Imperial City (Huangcheng in Chinese) refers to the section of Beijing housing the Forbidden City. This leads us into the Meridian Gate, which is the image most commonly associated with the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City completed in 1420 by the Yongle emperor and the Meridian Get was originally for the emperor’s use alone.\n\nWe can also infer that the film is not set in the Qing dynasty which succeeded the Ming as nobody in the film is seen to have a queue. The queue was the traditional hairstyle of the Manchu people and after they conquered China and established the Qing dynasty they demanded that all Chinese men follow this tradition and wear their hair in a queue. The film could also not have been set in the early Qing dynasty, before the queue order was enforced, as not even the emperor and his officials are seen to have queues. So based on these clues we can conclude that the film takes place in the early 17th century, before 1644 when the Ming dynasty collapsed. With this concluded it leads us to the bad history that is also in the movie.\n\nThe most striking example of bad history is the Huns. They make fantastic villains for the film, but the Huns were only prominent from the 4th to 6th centuries and even then the extent of their influence never reached China. The theory I’ve seen to work around this is that the leader of the Huns is named Shan Yu, which is possibly a reference to the Xiongnu, a group of nomadic steppe people who raided the ancient Chinese and fought the Han emperors. They notably have sometimes also been called Huns. However this theory would also be badhistory as the Xiongnu had been long since been sinocized and incorporated into China by the Ming dynasty. The only other possible explanation for this badhistory is that the term Hun is used as a pejorative term, and the invaders are actually Mongols. Mongols would be a period appropriate antagonist as they were well known to have raided the Ming borders, however the theory is undercut as Shan Yu calls his own army the Huns, which he wouldn’t do if they weren’t meant to be Huns. So we can chalk that one up as some badhistory.\n\nThe next example of bad history is the cannons that play a pivotal role in the film’s exciting confrontation between the huns and the Chinese Army. As far as I can tell the cannons shown in the movie are entirely made up. The closest example of a real Chinese cannon resembling the ones in the film are those described in the Huolongjing, a 14th century Chinese book on weaponry. The closest cannon in the Huolongjing to the cannons seen in Mulan are the Huo long chu shui, which was a multistage rocket which would fire a dragon shaped projectile which would then launch a series of smaller rockets once it was airborne. The cannons shown in the film fire a dragon shaped projectile but it does not launch smaller rockets, which I can’t find any evidence for having existed. The cannon is likely an attempt by Disney censors to avoid showing real cannons to allow the film to maintain a G rating.\n\nThe final notable bit of badhistory I noticed in the film was general Li’s helmet. General Li, Shang’s father, has a really cool helmet, but the only problem with it is that it’s from the wrong dynasty. The helmets of generals in the ming dynasty looked more like [this helmet](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/10/05/18/10051880b21a0e4bb637df7513a15ad9.jpg) while General Li’s helmet most closely resembles [this helmet](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-90M-FQfAYCY/V8UF8Ayw7QI/AAAAAAAADlY/HdhDn3VYxoEhLyBB0Zkw1tvvcouYCUL3QCLcB/s1600/Han33.jpg) from the Han dynasty.\n\nAlso, though not explicitly bad history, the Hun archer mentions that the village they are about to attack is surrounded by black pines. Presumably this refers to the Pinus thunbergii, or the Japanese black pine. But as the name implies this tree is native to Japan and some parts of Korea so I’m unsure how it would be in a village in northern China.\n\nThose are all the instances of badhistory I noticed in the film, though I’m sure more exist. Mulan is definitely one of my favorite movies and it’s really neat that the film has so many historical references that you can actually pinpoint approximately when the film took place despite the film never telling you when it’s set. So hopefully you’ve all enjoyed this post that was very different from the type of posts I usually make and my next one will probably be more in line with what I usually post. I hope that a few of you learned a little more about Chinese history from this post and possibly are interested in learning more about the fascinating history of China. Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a wonderful day!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/845757/bad_history_of_womens_pro_wrestling_from_wwe/",
        "text": "As anyone who watches WWE knows, the company has lately been running what it calls the 'Women's Revolution,' which is a term that means 'We Finally Decided, In 2016, To Stop Treating Women As A Joke, And Expect To Be Praised For That.' This has included an increase in the number of women's matches on shows that aren't jokey fanservice, which is good, and an increase in making sure the boss's daughter comes out to stop the show and talk about how we're going to have a historic First Women's (Whatever) soon¹, which is a lot less so. In the spirit of patting themselves on the back for noticing that women exist, they've decided to add to Wrestlemania a massive women's battle royal. Admittedly, they did that before too, but this time they're using the phrase 'historic' and 'revolutionary' to describe it, so it's not a waste of time and talent and Stephanie MacMahon is literally the reincarnation of Eleanor Roosevelt. Now because their male version was called the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal, this one needs to also be a Memorial Battle Royal. Now naturally, WWE would have to choose someone fitting for this. Fortunately for them, they happen to have a former women's AND men's champion (even if it was the Intercontinental and not World title, THANKS STEVE,) a woman who was incredibly popular for a long time, was key to them becoming the company they are today, was promoted as the heir to Andre the Giant while she worked for them, and probably most key to having a memorial event, is dead. Unfortunately, THAT woman used to date the boss's son in law, so they had to choose someone else instead.\n\nThe woman they went with was not necessarily a terrible pick. Mary Lillian Ellison, AKA \"The Fabulous Moolah.\" She may not have been the most stand-up person in history, (in fact, as I will explain, she was probably one of the least stand-up people you'd find) but if we weren't allowed to honor people in pro wrestling who WEREN'T horrible people, we'd have to limit our discussion of the history of the business to \"That one time Mick Foley jumped off a cage, and then nothing happened for a few years until John Cena showed up.\" WWE, though, was not content to simply honor her as a successful businesswoman who had a 50-year career in a business that chews people up and spits them out like an overcooked steak, and a person who was willing to risk serious injury in the ring well into a time in her life that most people are at risk of injury from such high-risk activities as 'Walking too fast,' becoming a WWF women's champion at the age of 76. That's an impressive career, and accolades well worth praising someone for. You could even point out that she was one of wrestling's longest-running champions, holding a women's championship for almost 28 years straight, never being without the belt for more than a month, with multiple reigns, one of which lasted ten years, six months, and eight days from April 2nd, 1968, to October 10th, 1978². Now all of these statements have caveats, many of which I'll explain. For example, \"It's not too hard to hold onto a championship when the owner of the company puts you in charge of everything related to the women's division,\" but to be perfectly fair to WWE, they shouldn't HAVE to admit their show is fake on the show. They sort of do anyway, but they don't HAVE to.\n\nThat said, WWE was not content to simply praise her for the really cool things she did, and decided to rewrite history to make her one of the greatest female athletes, indeed, greatest WOMEN that ever lived. The victors may not always write history, but sadly, the MacMahons usually do, and I thought I could at the very least provide some counternarrative, and explain why WWE's video praising the history of Moolah is extremely misleading whenever it stops outright lying to you. Watch along!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WWE/status/973375209116807168\n0:05 \"Mary Lillian Ellis rose to be one of the greatest pioneers for women's athletics.\"\n\nThat didn't take long. Fabulous Moolah did not become one of the greatest pioneers for women's athletics. As far as women's professional wrestling goes, the only thing Moolah pioneered was making it really boring to watch and treating the women as jokes and eye instead of legitimate athletes. (Perhaps not coincidentally, her 28-year-reign marks a period during which women's professional wrestling in the US consistently lost popularity and prestige, and American women would not reach a level of popularity and ability that even approached that of their Japanese peers until the last decade³.\n\n0:08: \"In the era of Babe Zaharias, Esther Williams, and Althea Gibson, Moolah challenged the norms of a once-male dominated sport to become the inaugural WWE women's champion, a championship that the first woman of pro wrestling held for over 27 years. \"\n\nFirst, Babe Zaharias was far more successful in the very early, prior to Moolah's becoming champion. Esther Williams was, in fact, successful in the 50s... But she was also successful in the 40s, having been considered for the 1940 Olympics which were canceled due to an unfortunate outbreak of 'terrifying war.' Althea Gibson is more accurate, winning her first Grand Slam the same year that Moolah took the women's title.\n\nAs far as a largely male-dominated world, that's false too. Well, at least the way it's implied. While wrestling has always been 'male dominated,' the fact that most able-bodied young men in the 40s were off fighting a war created a vaccuum that was filled by some of the TRUE pioneers of women's wrestling, such as Mildred Burke, who won the title in 1938 and carried it until her divorce from her husband, promoter, and trainer Billy Wolfe in 1952, at which point she left the company.\n\nUnlike Moolah, who believed that women's wrestling should be treated as a sideshow focused on things like hair pulling and comedy, Burke believed that female wrestling should be treated as a serious competition. So while Moolah became the trainer for most all women who wrestled from the 1950s to the 1980s, Japanese Joshi stars took an inspiration from Burke, and became major successes in their own right. One could argue that, especially considering the influence Japanese wrestling and Joshi and Junior Heavyweight styles in particular have on modern professional wrestling, the current women's stars of WWE (women like Charlotte or Sasha, not to mention actual Japanese women like Asuka) owe a lot more to Mildred Burke than they do to Moolah.\n\nAll of which is to say that while wrestling WAS a male-dominated sport throughout its history and up to today, it was far LESS male dominated when Moolah entered it in 1949, than when she wrestled her last match in 2003.\n\nFinally, it's TRUE that she was the inaugural WWF women's champion. What they aren't noting is that she worked for Vince Macmahon Sr when he took his company out of the NWA, and that her becoming the inaugural champion was not a case of being a trailblazer who fought for women's wrestling, so much as happening to work for a guy who wanted to leave the NWA while holding the belt. And in fact, rather than RETURN the belt when she left the NWA, she sold it to Vince Sr, in exchange for being allowed to book the women's division.\n\nAnd, as I said before, she won the /NWA/ Women's championship in 1956, not the WWF one. Vince Sr. left the NWA in 1963. 27 years after was 1990, the year that WWF deactivated their women's championship, then held by Rockin' Robin. And, while her 1975 loss is recognized by no-one, WWE did, at the time, recognize multiple losses during the period of her title run - It was not 28 unbroken years.\n\n1:28 \"We started out with Moolah, the longest reigning women's champion of all time.\"\n\nConsidering the multiple interruptions to her reign, Mildred Burke, who held the title for an unbroken 14 years, held the women's championship longer than 28 broken years. That's how math works.\n\n(I won't comment on being 'one of the first women to compete at Madison Square Garden,' because I don't have access to the history of Garden cards, or anything of the like.)\n\n1:34 Bayley: \"I just, grew up watching her!\"\n\nPamela Martinez, ('Bayley,') is 28 years old, about the same age as Moolah's alleged title run. Born on June 15th, 1989, Bayley would not have grown up watching Moolah wrestle. One could argue she did in fact grow up 'watching Moolah,' in that Moolah was, throughout the late '90s, a comedy character used for gross out about her being a sexually active septugenarian, along with her friend Mae Young. But to say she grew up 'watching Moolah' would be like someone born in 2003 saying they grew up watching The Rock. They probably did, but they grew up watching him act in movies and have brief Mania appearances. This may not be untrue, but it is misleading.\n\n1:43 Charlotte: \"This woman who wants to... Empower other women.\"\n\nNow THIS is the line that made me write this up. And as fun and jokey as I've been up to this point, I'm going to change my tone, and add a content warning for discussion of forced prostitution, robbery, blackmail, and sexual coercion, because this is where we go from 'Silly WWE history' to 'You are lionizing a horrible person.'\n\nUp until now, it's been acceptable WWE-history. Moolah was popular for a while, though less so than other women. But to say Moolah wanted to 'empower other women' was, quite frankly, ridiculous. It's insulting to anyone who knows anything about Moolah's 28-year hold on the title.\n\nFabulous Moolah did not want to empower women. She wanted to empower herself. It's even in the name. When asked why she wanted to wrestle, she answered 'the fabulous moolah,' and it stuck. It's true she created the 'Women's Wrestling As Softcore Grappling For Men' trend, but one could make the argument (though wrongly) that that was necessary, and at the very least, that she was trying to get women's wrestling ahead, even if she failed. However, Moolah's detrimental effect on women in the industry during the three decades she controlled the championship extended beyond her effect on the in-ring product.\n\nStarting with the least horrible part, her exploitative business practices. Not only did her holding onto the belt mean that other women who grew popular were pushed back down to keep her on top, her behavior as the head of the division was itself far worse than just burying younger talent.\n\nMultiple women who worked in WWF's women's division between 1963, when she entered, and 1983, when Vince Macmahon Jr (the current owner) took over and made her surrender the title to rising star Wendi Richter, reported that Moolah treated them less like fellow professional wrestlers and co-workers, and more like her property. Moolah took a shocking percentage of any money any of the women earned, even by the standards of professional wrestling, leaving other women in the company struggling to make ends meet and, in a travelling business with no travel subsidies, it would often cost money to work for WWF as a woman.\n\nNext up, her career as a blackmailer. Working with her friend Mae Young, Moolah would scam married men by seducing them, taking them back to their hotel room, beating them, and stealing their money. They would then threaten to send their wives pictures of this if they didn't pay them more money, under the theory that the men would not go to the police, since to do so they'd have to admit to trying to have an affair AND being beat up by women. This didn't always work out perfectly, which is why we have record of it, but it did set up a solid side business.\n\nFinally, and most disturbingly, it was common for wrestlers signed to one promotion to be 'loaned out' to another promotion, whether for one night or a few months. The other promotion gets someone with name value they don't have to build, and your wrestler can go do something while you don't have plans for them. The wrestler would receive a portion of the gate, and the company with their contract would as well. Not only, as I mentioned, did Moolah take a majority of the booking fee that would be paid to the wrestler rather than the company (and a portion of the company's take as well, which is what she was 'supposed' to get,) the women loaned out were expected to provide sexual favors to the promoters and wrestlers at the company as well. Those who refused would, on their return, matches with Moolah, where she would effectively beat them up for ten minutes before giving them the go ahead to give up.\n\n(It's worth noting that this phenomenon of 'punishment' matches was not unique to Moolah, and was common throughout the wrestling world. If you pissed off the booker, a high profile wrestler, or some people just thought you needed a lesson, you would be booked to wrestle someone in a match where your opponent would take the chance to inflict physical punishment for whatever real or imagined offense you had engaged in. The last high-profile case of this occurred at the 2005 Royal Rumble, where several wrestlers attacked Daniel Puder.\n\nToday, WWE prefers to punish its performers by publically humiliating them, rather than physical assault.)\n\nAs I said, I don't mind WWE choosing Moolah. She was a horrible person, but there were a lot of horrible people in the business. She was, admittedly, worse than most, but she was still a major figure in the industry who you really can't talk about American women's wrestling without, and while she probably ruined women's wrestling for 30 years, she still found success where others didn't. And on top of that, for as awful as he was, Vince MacMahon Jr. has always kept his promise to his father that a few people his father was close to would always been recognized as the greats in WWE. That list included Gorilla Monsoon, (who Vince used as a commentator, then, as he got ill, an onscreen authority figure, and continued to pay out a contract for employment after his death,) \"Classy\" Freddy Blassie (who was largely written out in 1993, but continued to pick up a regular paycheck at a generous portion of company revenue until 2003, and Dennis Dunn, (Who not only was employed until his death, but whose son, Kevin, has a lifetime job as producer on all WWE television products, and owns WWE stock worth $2.7 Million, the second largest held by a private individual not directly related to Vince MacMahon, despite his duties being effectively limited to directing television shows, while the largest is owned by company co-president George Barrios,) and, finally, Moolah. Who was also given a roll on WWE until her death, received regular paychecks, and was offered (but turned down) a fair share of the company in 1997. Vince MacMahon is a lot of things, but one thing you can't accuse him of is being a bad son⁴, and I respect that he's giving Moolah a place in WWE history.\n\nWhat I DO NOT respect, however, is presenting her as a great feminist hero who wanted to empower other women. She was a blackmailer, she was a thief, she was a tyrannical and abusive boss and trainer who stole money from her employees and singlehandedly turned a thriving women's pro wrestling scene into a show for comedy and titillation. I would say she set things back, but she didn't, because women's pro wrestling was a lot healthier at literally any point prior.\n\n¹This is often not actually the first women's Whatever, but if we admitted that we might have to somehow imply that Stephanie MacMahon is not the greatest feminist who ever lived, and we certainly couldn't allow that.\n\n²BAD HISTORY FROM HYENA DANDY! Sue Green defeated Moolah for the title in Texas in 1975, but this title change was not officially recognized by WWF and I'm going to let them use their 'official' history. Maybe if I do so they can explain to me how Tatsumi Fujinami manages to count as a former NWA Champion without giving Ric Flair an extra reign.\n\n³ Note that I said popularity AND ability. While women like Trish Stratus, Lita, and the aforementioned Chyna (my favorite) reached great POPULARITY in the late-'90s and early 2000s, it was not until far more recently that women like Paige, AJ Lee, or Charlotte Flair began to do so while also putting on great matches.\n\n⁴ Except for the whole 'Made his father think he wouldn't do the thing he immediately did as a condition for buying the company,' thing, but that's not even proven and really Vince Sr only wanted his son not to go national because he thought it wouldn't WORK, not because he didn't want the company national.",

        "text": "[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMPkVRfWc04) is Simple History's recent video on the Maginot Line. \n\nNow, I believe the specifics on the Maginot Line stated are correct (Though the cost is argued, some sources put it higher at 5 billion francs), I'm not an expert on it but it does sound right from what I've read. The reason this is badhistory is around the 1:50 mark with this line, \"Unfortunately, the French did not prepare for the Blitzkrieg tactics of the German forces, or their invasion through neutral Belgium, which allowed them to simply outflank the Maginot Line in 1940.\" \n\nIgnoring the Blitzkrieg tactics bit, as I'm sure it's been discussed about here before, the focus is on the statement that they did not prepare for an attack through Belgium, as if it was some massive oversight by the French who didn't realize that it could just be outflanked. No, the entire point of the Maginot Line was to force any German attack to go around, almost certainly through Belgium, thus guaranteeing France would have allies in the war, and more importantly allowing them to concentrate the majority of their forces there to meet the Germans. The Maginot Line served as a blocker to prevent a major invasion from the east, in that regard it worked splendidly. The French knew all along the Germans would try to circumvent it, it was the whole purpose of the line. \n\nSo, to say the French were unprepared for an attack through Belgium is just silly. The bulk of the Allied forces were concentrated there, the mistake was in falling for Erich von Manstein's trap. Army Group B's attacks into the Low Countries were merely feints, to draw the Allied forces further up north, all so Army Group A could make the push through the Ardennes and cut them off. This is what the French were not prepared for, the attack through the Ardennes forest, something that they had previously thought essentially impassable for a military force. The Germans proved them wrong and in little more than a week had reached the Channel, cutting off the best troops France had to offer and most of the BEF. \n\n[Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France#Dyle_Plan/Plan_D) a pretty good summary of the defenses the Allies had prepared in the area from wikipedia, its source is The Seeds of Disaster: The Development of French Army Doctrine, 1919–39.\n\n\"By May 1940, the 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of France from the Channel coast to the west end of the Maginot Line. The Seventh Army (Général d'armée Henri Giraud), BEF (General Lord Gort), First Army (Général d'armée Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard) and Ninth Army (Général d'armée André Corap) were ready to advance to the Dyle Line, by pivoting on the right (southern) Second Army. The Seventh Army would take over west of Antwerp, ready to move into Holland and the Belgians were expected to delay a German advance, then retire from the Albert Canal to the Dyle, from Antwerp to Louvain. On the Belgian right, the BEF was to defend about 20 km (12 mi) of the Dyle from Louvain to Wavre with nine divisions and the First Army on the right of the BEF was to hold 35 km (22 mi) with ten divisions from Wavre across the Gembloux Gap to Namur. The gap from the Dyle to Namur north of the Sambre, with Maastricht and Mons on either side, had few natural obstacles and was a traditional route of invasion, leading straight to Paris. The Ninth Army would take post south of Namur, along the Meuse to the left (northern) flank of the Second Army.\" \n\nI would say that's not unprepared at all. They had a significant amount of their forces ready to counter a German attack through Belgium, it wasn't a surprise to them in the least when the Germans invaded through there. It's just the oversight was with the Ardennes, something he doesn't mention in the video at all. What annoys me about this is it perpetuates the idea that the Maginot Line was a massive failure, when in reality it did just what it was created to do. [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2645az/was_the_maginot_line_really_a_huge_blunder_for/) is a great askhistorians post that explains how the Maginot Line factored into the French defense.

        "text": "So most of you have probably heard about [this news story](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-public-school-teacher-white-nationalist-podcast_us_5a99ae32e4b089ec353a1fba) about a Florida teacher who was fired after it was revealed that she had not so secretly been hosting a white-supremacist podcast. The podcast (entitled Unapologetic) has been removed from basically everywhere on the internet and I cannot find any working links to the episodes, which I’ll assume is an attempt by Tianna’s lawyers to remove any evidence. But luckily for me, and unluckily for Tianna, I had the podcast’s homepage open yesterday before the page was deleted so I was able to download the episode I’ll be discussing. [It’s here if you want to listen to two people spout nonsense for a half-hour and have some context on what I’ll be discussing](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0ZSuo9ujvoC). The episode mentioned is hour long interview with Brian Hendrix, a white-supremacist  author whose book is sold exclusively on a website called groypthink.com (not a typo, it’s a white nationalist website that Brian made to sell his book). Brian also writes for a white nationalist website called Halsey News. The podcast is hosted by “Tianna Dalichov”, a pseudonym for former middle school social studies teacher Dayanna Volitich who was suspended for hosting a podcast espousing racist sentiments. Dayanna is also an author, as she [wrote an unsuccessful young adult book series](https://www.amazon.com/Agenda-46-Rebellion-Rising-1/dp/1517770009). So with that out of the way let’s take an unapologetic look at the Unapologetic podcast.\n\nFair warning, this post may toe the line between anthropology and history at some points but I’ll try to focus on the bad history unless one of the hosts says something so wrong that I just can’t let it go\n \n-Brian seems to be under the impression that Newton only said that Gravity existed and that it was only later that we learned how to measure gravity and learn what G is. This is false as Newton had already developed his Law of Universal Gravitation by 1686.\n\n-Modern humans most likely emerged about 300,000 years ago, the 200,000 that Brian mentions is a less likely  possibility, though admittedly there is some debate as to when the actual year was and in some places I have seen 200,000 years ago given as a possibility.\n\n-Ok so we get into some real bad history when Brian describes the lives of two made up humans named Tom and Tim living 200,000 years ago, with Tom representing African cultures and Tim representing European cultures. He describes Tom as having to “chase down food in the desert” while Tim is “stuck in a cave because of the ice age”. This is simply an inaccurate analogy, humans only began migrating out of Africa about 100,000 years ago so I have no clue how Tim somehow got to Europe. Also humans didn’t survive the ice age because they were “stuck in a cave”, they survived because they lived in the equatorial region. And the oldest known settlements in Africa only go back 70,000 years and it’s notably not in the middle of the desert where water is scarce, it’s on the Nile River. And Tim should definitely not be in Europe 200,000 years in the past as humans only reached Europe about 40,000 years ago.\n\n-Brian then elaborates on his flawed analogy by stating that Tom’s African culture would develop a hunter-gatherer lifestyle while Tim’s European cave people would have to start breeding animals. The hunter-gatherer lifestyle was obviously not exclusive to Africa, and it was not sedentary peoples who first domesticated livestock, it was nomads who were practicing nomadic pastoralism. Also Brian leaves out the development of agriculture which is kind of important in the story of human development. But the development of agriculture runs against Brian’s ignorant depiction of Africans as hunter-gatherers as one of the first places to adopt agriculture was Egypt, so that could explain why he left it out. Or maybe he’s just an idiot. Probably both.\n\n-Brian thinks that racism is genetically provable rather than being socially constructed when even the wikipedia page for race says it lacks a basis in biology. And on Brian’s point about determining race from skeletons, you can determine where someone’s ancestors are from through that but that’s different from race.\n\n-Brian then literally says that he uses the term culture to avoid sounding like a white nationalist, so he's kind of showing his hand a bit by saying this.\n\n-Brian incorrectly defines all American Indian cultures as hunter gatherer when we have very clear evidence of American Indians practicing agriculture and building very successful civilizations. The Incas, Aztecs, and Mayans were very clearly not hunter-gatherers.\n\n-Oh my fucking gosh Brian just said that Black people go looting because they don’t know what else to do in a natural disaster. This isn’t bad history, it’s just being a bad person. It’s honestly just insane that someone actually unironically believes something so ridiculous.\n\n-Brian says that there was never a point in history where Black people built cities. Someone should really tell Brian about Mali, Greater Zimbabwe, Songhai, Benin, Nubia, and all the other civilizations that developed in Africa and did build cities. Brian needs to get his head out of his ass and stop believing every racist stereotype he hears about Africa and its history.\n\n-Brian says that if the Nile flooded that the Egyptians would “just move on”, implying that they wouldn’t rebuild and says that they wouldn’t build dams or levees. Brian needs to go to a 6th grade social studies course (preferably one that isn’t taught by Tiana Dalichov/ Dayanna Voltich) because in 6th grade students learn how the Nile floods in a predictable pattern and the reason that ancient Egyptians never attempted to stop the flooding was because the floods deposited silt into the soil around the river which would make it extremely valuable as farmland. Also the Egyptians definitely didn’t pack-up and move everytime the nile flooded, they were a sedentary society.\n\n-Brian then compares the earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010 to the earthquake that hit Japan in 2011 and Tiana/Dayanna then says that the only thing different between Haiti and Japan is the culture. That’s fucking stupid because there’s a fuckton of things different between Haiti and Japan like their economic prosperity, their differing histories (Japan was an imperialist nation while Haiti was founded as the result of a slave rebellion), and their different geographical locations.\n\n-Brian says that people were oppressed in Haiti sarcastically like he thinks that they weren’t living in some of the worst enslaved conditions on the planet and were then shunned by the rest of the world upon gaining their independence due to other nations’ fears about supporting a nation founded by former slaves.\n\n-Tiana/Dayanna literally says “they (referring to black people) have low IQ’s because they live in a primitive backwards culture”. I guess the first thing to say to that is that there is no biological connection between race and IQ and the only cultural connection is that IQ tests are biased in favor of the culture delivering the test. If you don’t believe this I’d direct your attention [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/why-people-keep-misunderstanding-the-connection-between-race-and-iq/275876/). And the second issue is that Black and African cultures are extremely diverse and lumping them all together as primitive and backwards displays an astounding level of ignorance about the world that we all live in. Prior to this Brian was saying the majority of the racist garbage but after hearing Tiana/Dayanna say this I definitely understand why she was fired because oh my gosh, someone who thinks this should definitely not be employed by a school!\n\n-Brian then says that “White people bred with Neanderthals and that’s how we (referring to white people) developed more brain mass”. The issues with this are 2-fold. First off, White people don’t have more brain mass than any other race. Secondly is that there is little to no evidence of Neanderthals significantly interbreeding with modern humans. So Brian’s theory kind of falls apart there.\n\n(Edit: Several people in the comments have brought up that i may have been working from outdated sources when making this claim. So as a correction there is evidence that modern humans did interbreed with Neanderthals, however this interbreeding does not support Brian's white-supremacist conclusion)\n\n-Brian says that Africans never built bridges, dams, or cathedrals which is demonstrably false and can be proven with [these bridges](http://www.africaranking.com/top-10-longest-bridges-africa/), [these dams](http://www.africanzeal.com/list-largest-dams-africa/), and [this cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Our_Lady_Mary_of_Zion) which was originally built in the 4th century and has been rebuilt multiple times.\n\nOk so with that episode finished I’m going to call it a day. There’s another half hour of interview in the next episode with the same guest but I honestly don’t think I could stomach it. This podcast is some of the most vile and ignorant racist trash that I’ve ever had the misfortune of listening to. I cannot express how glad I am that Brian and Tiana/Dayanna’s careers are so irreparably damaged that they will never work in an academic environment ever again. And with that I’ll just end this here. I’m so sorry if any of you decided to actually listen to the podcast, it’s just objectively terrible not only due to the fact that they’re both racists pretending to be intellectuals but also because Tiana/Dayanna has no clue how to run a podcast at even a mediocre level. So in conclusion I guess I’m just glad that this woman finally was found out and I’m glad that she’ll likely never teach again. Thanks for reading this and making it this far into my post, i hope you have a wonderful day.\n\nEdit: Several changes have been made to the post to more adequately follow the subreddit's rules.",

        "text": "So last week I was performing my ritual of perusing the campus bookstore and peeking at reference books when I came across DK’s *Remarkable Books* book. Paging through, I found that one of these “remarkable books” was Mao’s Little Red Book.\n\nMost the entry seems fairly innocuous, though it mainly focuses on the book’s content and distribution, and only gives passing mention to the crimes of the Cultural Revolution, which seems a bit tasteless to say the least. However, reading through, I found a glaring historical flaw that could have been fixed with a simple google search:\n\n[“After Mao took control of China in 1949, the national flag was changed from yellow to red”](http://i.imgur.com/c8zR4Rz.jpg)\n\nThis is wrong. Very, very wrong. This could be debunked in ten seconds, but since this is r/badhistory, I’m going to get into a bit of flag history.\n\nThe anemic Qing Empire adopted [this badass design](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Flag_of_the_Qing_Dynasty_%281889-1912%29.svg) in 1889. As we can see, yellow is the primary color, which was associated with the ruling Manchu ethnic group. During the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, there were several revolutionary flags, **none of which had yellow as the dominant color**.\n\nThe eventual design that won recognition as the flag of the Republic of China was [the “rainbow flag”](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China_%281912-1928%29.svg). The five colors represent the five major ethnic supergroups in China: Red for the Han, Yellow for the Manchu, Blue for the Mongols, White for Muslims, and Black for Tibetans. This reflected Sun Yat-Sen and other revolutionary leader’s strong belief in racial unity after millennia of having one of the “races” dominate the others at various points. As you can see, yellow is included, but not dominant.\n\nAfter Sun Yat-sen was forced to flee south at the beginning of the Warlord era (I’m glossing over a lot of detail here) he adopted the [“white sun and blue sky over red earth” design](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg), presumably to help distinguish his rival government from the military junta now running Bejing. The red represents fraternity and the blood of revolutionaries, the white equality and democracy, and blue for nationalism and liberty. Notice that there is no yellow on this flag at all. Following the success of the 1928 Northern Expedition, **this would be China’s National flag until 1949.**\n\nSo, why does this matter? To me, it’s a matter of reliability. If I can trust the book on such a simple, easily corrected fact, what else can’t it be trusted on? It might seem pedantic to some, but to me, accuracy is important and such a blatant error makes the source questionable, which is really unfortunate.\n\nSource:\n\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China (Again- such an easy fact check!)",

        "text": "If you're reading this, then it's because my own watching of *That 70s Show* on Netflix has continued and my gift of catching stupid things has revealed itself once more.\n\nMore specifically, we're up to Season 5, Episode 6, \"Over the Hills and Far Away\".  The gang of Eric, Kelso, Hyde, and Fez are taking a visit with Eric's parents to the University of Wisconsin.  Meanwhile, Donna and Jackie are visiting Marquette University.  But with the boyfriends and girlfriends separate for what may be a hedonistic weekend, the tension of what the present and the future hold with college looming is there.\n\nSure enough, the guys love UW but have to fight temptation.  And Eric is terrified of what the future of his relationship with Donna might mean if they're apart for four years.  Meanwhile, Eric is also dealing with the misery of mother Kitty going through the early throes of menopause.\n\nBut these are nothing compared to the real issue that's about to appear.  And that is when Donna and Jackie are at Marquette, with Donna wondering why she has to visit a school that she doesn't want to go to.  And while pondering this aloud, we see her standing in the vicinity of a large yellow poster that says \"GO GOLDEN EAGLES\".\n\nThe Marquette Golden Eagles have a tremendous athletic tradition, and recent years had been especially kind to them.  Although the school's football program was dropped in 1960, the basketball program had risen up from mid-level mediocrity to national contenders.  The first glimpse of success was in 1954-55, when coach Jack Nagle led the team to a 24-3 record and then NCAA Tournament wins over Miami University and then over \\#2 Kentucky.  Unfortunately this was an anomaly; Nagle's career record at Marquette was just 45-52 outside of that one magical season.\n\nEddie Hickey was hired to replace Nagle in 1958, and he repaid the school by leading the basketball team to a 23-6 record and another tournament appearance.  Hickey coached for six years, leading Marquette to two NCAA tournament berths (no wins) and the semifinals of the 1963 NIT.  He left in 1964, after a dismal 5-21 season.\n\nBut nothing could prepare even the most optimistic fans for what was to come.  With Hickey gone, the coaching vacancy was filled by Belmont Abbey head coach Al McGuire, whose Crusaders had gone 13-39 in the previous two seasons.\n\nHis first two years at Marquette were middling: 8-18 in 1964-65 and 14-12 in 1965-66.  But then in 1966-67 came a breakthrough, as McGuire's boys went 21-9 and earned an NIT invitation.  Once there, they knocked off Tulsa, Providence, and Marshall in three close games.  Alas, the title game against Southern Illinois was a disappointment, with the Salukis defeating Marquette by a 71-56 score.  Still, it had been a tremendous season.  But could it continue?\n\nAs it turned out, it could.  The next year saw a 23-6 record and an invite to the NCAA Tournament, where a win against Bowling Green was followed by a loss in the round of sixteen against Kentucky.  The next year saw Marquette go one round further, losing a 75-73 game in the round of eight against Purdue.\n\nIt continued on though: a 20-3 record in 1969-70, followed by storming through the NIT field to win the school's first basketball championship.  Then it was a 26-0 record in 1970-71, only to come to a halt with a 60-59 NCAA tournament loss against Ohio State.  The next two years saw 25-4 records, spoiled by losses in the round of sixteen of the NCAA tournament.\n\n1973-74 saw the big breakthrough: a 26-5 record with an NCAA tournament invite.  Slotted into the Mideast Region, Marquette knocked off Ohio University in the first round, then upset Vanderbilt in the second round.  This was followed by a thrilling 72-70 victory against Michigan, pushing them into the Final Four.  In the national semifinal game, it was a 64-51 victory over Kansas....and into the national championship game against North Carolina State.  That is where the journey ended, with a 76-64 loss against the Wolfpack and a bit of notoriety as McGuire became the first head coach ever ejected from a title game.\n\nRather than let that be the high mark, it was right back to work.  1974-75 saw a 23-4 record and another tournament apperance, 1975-76 a 27-2 record and making it into the round of eight of the NCAA tournament.\n\nAnd then it finally happened.  Although Marquette began the 1976-77 season ranked \\#2 in the country and stormed out to a 4-0 record, they lost in short order to Louisville and Minnesota.  Dropped down to \\#12, they'd claw back, peeling off ten straight wins before a loss to Cincinnati.  After two more wins, it was three losses in a row against DePaul, Detroit, and Wichita State.  What looked like a dream season was rapidly coming undone.  A 73-58 win against in-state rival Wisconsin turned the tide, with three more wins in quick succession.  Then it was a loss against Michigan to end the regular season....\n\nMarquette was slotted into the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament, and dispatched Cincinnati 66-51 in the first round.  This was followed by a nail-biting 67-66 win over Kansas State, then an 82-68 win over Wake Forest to go back to the Final Four.\n\nThe national semifinal game against UNC-Charlotte went down to the wire.  With the score tied 49-49 and just :03 left on the clock, [a long inbound by Marquette to the far end was converted into a buzzer-beating basket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5u8JuNltiw) that put them back into the national championship game.\n\nIn the title game against North carolina, the Tar Heels gained a narrow second-half lead and then tried to milk the clock with the infamous Four Corners tactic.  A three-minute UNC possession ended with a missed shot, and Marquette would come back and take the lead before then turning their own slowdown offense loose.  Harried and fouled, Marquette simply buried all twelve of their late-game free throws to pull away en route to a 67-59 victory.  Marquette: national champions.\n\nHaving accomplished everything he wanted, McGuire retired as head coach with a career 295-80 record, plus an NIT and an NCAA championship.  His teams had earned postseason tournament invites in eleven consecutive years, nine of them to the NCAA tournament.\n\nMcGuire's top assistant Hank Raymonds took over as head coach, and the team didn't miss a beat.  By the time that Donna and Jackie are visiting the school sometime in either 1977 or 1978, the basketball team was on the road to yet another NCAA tournament invite.  All told, the ten years *after* McGuire's retirement all culminated in postseason invitations.  By the time the streak ended in 1987-88, Marquette had appeared in either the NCAA or NIT in twenty-one consecutive years.\n\nJackie and Donna were visiting Marquette in what were truly years of dizzying success for a non-football-playing school in Wisconsin.  They were one year removed from a national championship, and the possibility of more to come showed that these were indeed heady times.  Although it's extremely unlikely that the only indication of school spirit would be a lone \"GO GOLDEN EAGLES\" poster, that's not the issue.\n\nThe real issue is that this poster could not have existed for one very simple reason: Marquette was not the Golden Eagles, and they would not become the Golden Eagles for a few more years.\n\nFrom the *Gadsden Times*:\n\n&gt;Fans cheered the Marquette Warriors into the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA basketball tournament last season.  Will the new Marquette Golden Eagles do as well?\n&gt;\n&gt;At least one fan raised the question Monday as Marquette officials announced the selection of Golden Eagles to replace the Warriors nickname that was considered offensive to American Indians.\n\nThe date on this story?  [May 4, **1994**](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19940504&amp;id=bb0fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LtgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4542,383292), which is well outside of what could be considered the time frame of something called \"That 70s Show\".\n\nMarquette's national title came in what can only be described as [some very 70s uniforms](http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/ItemImages/000067/67736c_lg.jpeg), but it would not have been as the Golden Eagles.",

They spoke Latin instead of German, wore togas instead of pants, and kept the borders and government systems of the Romans. They were, in effect, Romans. Earlier in the 800s, Charlemagne sent dignitaries to marry Byzantine empress Irene and plans were made to reunite the Western and Eastern Roman Empires ~802AD. However, the Byzantine Nobles didn't like the idea and had her killed.\n\n&gt; Nobody thought the Roman Empire collapsed. People just thought the Roman Empire was run by Franks now. The last true Roman Emperor was probably Charles V in the 16th century, who ruled most of Western Europe, and had made plans to take France too. Following him, the Westphalian theory of statehood was developed in which existing kings agreed to respect each other's posessions, and within a century after the agreement, Edward Gibbon wrote The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and history was rewritten to post-rationalize nationalism.\n\nThis one was fun. Should be noted that the top comment calls them out saying this:\n\n&gt; Your statement that people considered themselves Roman until the 17th century is just completely false. The entire Renaissance clearly shows that people recognized that they no longer lived in a Roman world. The Americas were conquered for the glory of Spain, Britain, Portugal, and France, not the Romans.\n\nIn another comment found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/81480a/feminism_killed_rome/dv1cl6v/) (would quote it but it's a bit long) the first user claims adoption of certain Roman systems of military, bureaucracy and use of a ceremonial toga indicates not that Charlemagne was attempting to take on the systems of the Empire and fulfill the Imperial role in a successor state, but that Charlemagne had in fact recreated Western Rome as it was before the \"fall\" and this state lasted until Gibbons pointed out it did not.\n\nObviously, the Franks and further Germans never saw the Holy Roman Empire as an extension of the Western Empire, but just to hammer in that point, while the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned as Roman Emperors, the legitimacy given to the title by the elected title \"King of the Romans\". \"King of the Romans\" was originally called \"King of the Franks\" as early as the 900s which shows that even at the highest nobility of the Empire, it was understood that they were not Romans.\n\nGoing a little bit later than Charlemagne, the French culture and identity was one of the earliest and widely understood cultures in Europe, they were distinctly *not Roman* and everybody clearly knew it. The title \"King of France\" was first used in 1180 by [Phillip II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France) which obviously separated himself from the Kings of England if that distinction hadn't already existed.\n\nMy personal favorite part is his claim that it took until 1776 for Europe to realize it was no longer part of the Roman Empire. Like everybody just up and realized one day \"holy shit, we're actually French.\"",

        "text": "Black History Month is ostensibly a time to celebrate the contributions of black Americans, but more often than not, it is used an occasion for partisan necromancers to summon the revenants of black historical figures and enlist them in the political struggles of today. The preferred choice for conservatives is usually Martin Luther King, whose radicalism is stripped away, leaving only quotable generic, feel-good statements about equality that support some kind of notion of a color-blind society. But this year, there was a strange uptick in quotes from the right about Frederick Douglass, especially on [r/The_Donald](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7xj1a5/happy_200th_birthday_to_one_of_americas_greatest/?st=jdodgkgr&amp;sh=83f3508a).\n\nMaybe The_Donald has just been overcompensating ever since Trump’s gaffe last year when he [referred to Douglass as though he were still alive.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/02/trump-implied-frederick-douglass-was-alive-the-abolitionists-family-offered-a-history-lesson/?utm_term=.303c5bb7e3b2). Or maybe the right’s renewed interest in Douglass has something to do with the release earlier this month of a book by the Cato Institute’s Timothy Sandefur titled [“Frederick Douglass: A Self-Made Man.”](https://www.cato.org/multimedia/events/frederick-douglass-self-made-man) (the post on The_Donald corroborates this since it echoes a [tweet]( https://twitter.com/CatoInstitute/status/963876238426345475) sent by the Cato Institute the day before)\n\nIn his book, Sandefur makes the case that Frederick Douglass was a classical liberal, which today has become practically synonymous with “libertarian.” This is not the first time that libertarians have tried to claim Douglass as one of their own. Back in 2012, Damon Root of Reason magazine [made the same claim](https://reason.com/archives/2012/07/17/frederick-douglass-classical-liberal), and the following year, there was evidence that the libertarians’ campaign to brand Douglass as “our guy” had borne fruit when a writer in Salon pondered the [Tea Party’s new-found love of the radical abolitionist icon.](https://www.salon.com/2013/07/03/frederick_douglass_new_tea_party_hero/). \n\n#Classical liberal or reform liberal?\n\nMuch of the libertarian argument that Frederick Douglass was a “classical liberal” comes from the work of Nicholas Buccola, a political science professor at Linfield College and the author of “The Political Thought of Frederick Douglass: In Pursuit of American Liberty.” He was even interviewed for a Youtube video on Douglass for Libertarianism.org titled [“Where does Frederick Douglass Fit Into the Libertarian Tradition”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ0GKwAIouM&amp;t=8s).\n\nWatching this video one might get the impression that Buccola supports the libertarian interpretation of Douglass’ political thought, but interestingly enough, Buccola only a few months prior had written an [article](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/recovering-the-progressive-frederick-douglass) decrying exactly the sort of conservative appropriation of Douglass that he was now, wittingly or not, a party to. Furthermore, he places Douglass within the progressive tradition. Buccola’s thorough and nuanced analysis, which will be used throughout this post, provides an excellent overview of the ideas of one of America’s greatest thinkers. \n\nThe claim that Douglass was a classical liberal—while not entirely unfounded—is misleading. A case could be made that Douglass owed an intellectual debt to classical liberalism and that he shared many of its ideas, but that’s not sufficient to say he *was* a classical liberal in the sense that we’ve come to understand the word. All the ideological offspring of a tradition aren’t necessarily equivalent. For example, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek stood on opposing sides of a bloody civil war, but both claimed to be ideological heirs to Sun Yat-sen.\n\nBuccola places Douglass within the broad tradition of liberalism and identifies the two opposing currents within the tradition that roughly correspond to the left and right wing of contemporary mainstream American politics: [reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism) and [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism). The two share similar aims and concepts but they differ in how to realize those ideals. Buccola observes that while Douglass was an “ardent defender of self-ownership, self-reliance and several other lodestars of the classical liberal tradition, a pure libertarian he was not.” \n\nWith regard to concepts like self-ownership and natural rights, Douglass did take his cues from the founders of classical liberalism like Locke, but on practical issues of policy, his views often fell into the reform camp, with arguments for the type of government interventions that the average libertarian considers anathema. In short, Douglass generally took a classical view with regard to ends and ideals but tended toward reform liberalism when it came to means.\n\nBuccola cites political scientist Kenneth Dolbeare who argued that the principal tension within the liberal tradition stems from a conflict over the prioritization of different natural rights, with classical liberals and libertarians arguing that property rights are equally as important as the rights to life and liberty, while progressives and reform liberals contend that property rights are not as fundamental as the other two.\n\nOn this question, we are lucky enough to have a direct, unambiguous answer from Douglass himself. It’s hard to apply the label “classical liberal” to Douglass when it is clear that he had a deep concern for material equality that few, if any, libertarians share.\n\n&gt; The question, whether civilization is designed primarily for Man or for Property, can have but one direct answer, whatever may be the methods each may think desirable by which to attain that end. The happiness of man must be the primal condition on which any form of society can found a title to existence. The civilization, then, looked at in its material aspect alone, which on the one hand constantly increases its wealth-creating capacities and on the other as steadily leaves out the benefits thereof to at least seven-tenths of all who live within its influence, cannot have realized the fundamental condition of its continuance.\n\nBuccola argues that Douglass’ concerns about the conditions and pay of the working class “belie the claim that he was a laissez-faire thinker.” The brilliance of Douglass’ thought—tragically lost in any attempt to reduce him to an ideological mascot—is that he deftly navigated between the extremes of the liberal tradition, infusing classically liberal doctrines with concepts like “mutual responsibility” and “fair play.”\n\n\n##Self-reliance and “fair play”\n\nConservatives are fond of quoting writings and speeches like Douglass’ 1862 essay [“What shall be done with the slaves once emancipated?”](http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/4386) because on the surface, they seem to be a case for the ethos of rugged individualism that is at the core of conservative thought. His answer to the question of what to do with freed slaves was: “Do nothing with them; mind your business, and let them mind theirs. Your doing with them is their greatest misfortune. They have been undone by your doings, and all they now ask, and really have need of at your hands, is just to let them alone.”\n\nIt’s really tempting to see this as a ringing endorsement for the principle of laissez-faire, which translates literally to “left alone.” In his dissenting opinion in the landmark 2003 affirmative action case of Grutter v. Bollinger, Justice Clarence Thomas quoted another speech by Douglass with almost identical content.\n\nBut Buccola takes exception with Thomas’ attempt to portray Douglass as some kind of “anti-paternalist libertarian.” He observes that the meaning of Douglass’ words becomes clear when placed in the proper context: “If you see a negro wanting to purchase land, let him purchase it. If you see him on the way to school, let him go; don’t say he shall not go into the same school with other people.” \n\nBuccola argues that the demand to be “left alone” refers to interference by both state and non-state actor in the African-Americans’ free exercise of legitimate rights and interests. He adds that such statements were almost always accompanied by the demand for “fair play,” which demonstrates the progressive character of Douglass’ political thought:\n\n&gt; For Douglass, fair play meant that the social and economic rules were not rigged in favor of or against any particular group. He believed that government had a vital role to play in ensuring that individuals were relatively free to participate in the marketplace, and were not subject to systematic attempts to prevent them from making economic progress (as was the case, for example, with sharecropping).\n\nWhile Buccola concedes that both conservatives and progressives accept this as a legitimate function of government, they differ in how this should be achieved. He says that Douglass believed the government should take aggressive action to level the playing field, citing Douglass’ speech “Self-Made Men,” from which Sandefur takes the title of his book:\n\n&gt; It is not fair play to start the negro out in life, from nothing and with nothing, while others start with the advantage of a thousand years behind them. . . . Should the American people put a school house in every valley of the South and a church on every hillside and supply the one with teachers and the other with preachers, for a hundred years to come, they would not then have given fair play to the negro. The nearest approach to justice to the negro for the past is to do him justice in the present.\n\nDouglass’ libertarian fans either consciously omit the concept of “fair play,” mention it in passing or rationalize his progressive views so that they fit in within the classically liberal framework.\n\nWriting for Reason, Damon Root tries to square the circle:\n\n&gt; Douglass did defend an active role for the federal government, including subsidized land grants by the Freedmen's Bureau and universal public education for African Americans. But there is an important distinction between his justifications for these programs and the arguments made today by advocates of welfare-state liberalism.\n\n&gt; As far as Douglass was concerned, the former slaves had been robbed, not just of the fruits of their labor but of their very minds and bodies. They were therefore entitled to some serious compensation from the federal and state governments that had aided, abetted, and profited from those crimes. So he wasn't talking about redistribution; he was talking about restitution—paid directly to the victims.\n\nWhile we can’t really say with any sort of certainty what Douglass would say about policy issues today, Root—though he doesn’t state it outright—is strongly implying here that Douglass would be opposed to the welfare state. But to come to that conclusion, one has to assume that if Douglass were magically transported to the future, he would look at the present state of American society and say “fair play” has been achieved. If, as Root acknowledges, restitution to slaves was just, then the denial of that restitution post-Reconstruction and during the 100 years of Jim Crow segregation that followed was unjust.  In other words: not “fair play.”\n\nConservative columnist George Will, writing for the Washington Post, cited Sandefur’s book in a [recent article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/frederick-douglass-a-champion-of-american-individualism/2018/01/31/8698e452-05f1-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html?utm_term=.a55363883f46), but Will should be credited for actually giving fair play to “fair play,” noting the parallels between Douglass and LBJ:\n\n&gt; Although Douglass entered the post-Civil War era asking only that blacks at last be left to fend for themselves, he knew that “it is not fair play to start the Negro out in life, from nothing and with nothing.” A 20th-century Southerner agreed. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘you are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” \n\nBut who knows? Maybe Douglass, who championed compulsory public schooling and integration, might today favor privatization of education and oppose busing out of some abstract libertarian principle.\n\n## Douglass hated socialism and unions?\n\nRoot attempts to shore up Douglass’ classical liberal bonafides in another article titled “[Frederick Douglass hated socialism](http://reason.com/archives/2017/03/12/frederick-douglass-hated-socia).” Here Root could have been intellectually honest and accurately portrayed Douglass’ rejection of socialism, but he goes to great lengths to portray Douglass’ socialist associates within the abolitionist movement as cynical opportunists at best and enablers of slavery at worst, going so far as to argue, “When it came to attacking free labor, the socialists and the slaveholders adopted certain identical positions”\n \nHe (mis)quotes Carl Guarneri, historian of the 19th century utopian socialist movement, as saying “most socialists” before the civil war “were hostile or at least indifferent to the abolitionist appeal because they believed that it diverted attention from the serious problems facing northern workers with the onset of industrial capitalism.”\n\nHowever, instead of “most,” [Guarneri actually wrote “many”](https://books.google.com/books?id=3-qbKEL1vLAC&amp;q=abolition#v=onepage&amp;q=indifferent&amp;f=false) and instead of “socialists,” he wrote “labor leaders.” Both of these seemingly minor tweaks by Root fundamentally change the meaning of the sentence.\n\nOne of the major sources of friction between the liberal and utopian socialist factions of the abolitionist movement was the tendency of the latter to conflate chattel slavery with “wage slavery,” which understandably angered a former slave like Douglass. But Guarneri explained that, however misguided, such comparisons had a purpose and they weren’t malicious:\n\n&gt; (Albert) Brisbane and the Associationists (followers of Fourier) claimed that broadening the abolitionist platform to include attacks on wage slavery would attract greater working-class support for antislavery. A universal crusade against the oppression of all labor would be irresistible.\n\nUtopian socialists earned the reproach of Douglass, who called the equation of wage labor with slavery “arrant nonsense.” Libertarians have gotten [a lot of mileage out of this episode]( https://www.google.com/search?q=frederick+douglass+arrant+nonsense&amp;oq=frederick+douglass+arrant+nonsense&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l2j69i60j35i39l2.9782j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). With repetition, it has been stripped of its context, so Douglass is portrayed condemning not just the statement of one particular socialist but rather the “ideas of socialism.” One libertarian, in a book that is a veritable smorgasbord of bad history (Did you know Hitler was inspired by Lincoln?), [claims the “arrant nonsense” comment was directed at Marx, himself](https://books.google.com/books?id=LidEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=frederick+douglass+arrant+nonsense&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0teGPJRN-e&amp;sig=9KPaxjWeBzuWqwwzcUdbHXiIRCM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG1OOh2cjZAhUF-mMKHbCfD8E4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=frederick%20douglass%20arrant%20nonsense&amp;f=false), which is sort of funny if you consider that Marx was no fan of utopian socialism either.\n\nInterestingly, in a [later speech]( http://coloredconventions.org/items/show/554), Douglass himself would draw comparisons between the status of freedman before and after Emancipation. Of course, the key difference here is that he is referring to freed blacks specifically rather than wage labor in general. But note his use of a peculiar turn of phrase.\n\n&gt; Experience demonstrates that there may be a wages of slavery only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and *that this slavery of wages must go down with the other.*\n\nSo what is this “arrant nonsense” Douglass is talking about? Word order notwithstanding, “slavery of wages” sounds suspiciously like “wage slavery.” But then again, he is talking about freed slaves as a particular group of have-nots vulnerable to the exploitation of the haves, so he’s not necessarily referring to all of wage labor as slavery. Still, later in the speech he conspicuously diverges from the libertarian notion that relations between employer and a free employee are entirely voluntary, considering the disparities in power.\n\n&gt; An empty sack is not easily made to stand upright. The man who has it in his power to say to a man you must work the land for me, for such wages as I choose to give, has a power of slavery over him as real, if not as complete, as he who compels toil under the lash … \n\n&gt; Feeling themselves somehow or other entitled to our labor without the payment of wages, *it was not strange that they should make the hardest bargains for our labor and get it for as little as possible.* For them the contest was easy; their tremendous power and our weakness easily gave them the victory.\n\n\nAnd, I can’t really recall the last time I heard from a libertarian such a full-throated, passionate condemnation of economic inequality:\n\n&gt; The implication is irresistible—that where the landlord is prosperous, the laborer ought to share his prosperity, and whenever and wherever we find this is not the case there is manifestly wrong somewhere. This sharp contrast of wealth and poverty, as every thoughtful man knows, can exist only in one way, and from one cause, and that is by one getting more than its proper share of the reward of industry, and the other side getting less—and that in some way labor has been defrauded or otherwise denied of its due proportion, and we think the facts, as well as this philosophy, will support this view in the present case, and do so conclusively. \n\nAnd if one had to wager whether the following passage came from Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” or Murray Rothbard’s “Man, Economy &amp; State,” for argument’s sake, which would be the smarter bet?\n\n&gt; The labor of a country is the source of its wealth; without the colored laborer today the South would be a howling wilderness, given up to bats, owls, wolves and bears. He was the source of its wealth before the war, and has been the source of its prosperity since the war. He almost alone is visible in her fields, with implements of toil in his hands and laboriously using them today. Let us look candidly at the matter. While we see and hear that the South is more prosperous than it ever was before and rapidly recovering from the waste of war, while we read that it raises more cotton, sugar rice, tobacco, corn and other valuable products than it ever produced before, how happens it, we sternly ask, that the houses of its laborers are miserable huts, that their clothes are rags, and their food the coarsest and scantiest? How happens it that the landowner is becoming richer and the laborer poorer?\n\nOf course, we don’t really need to guess his attitudes on socialism because we know he rejected it, referring to it as “unrepublican.” That’s not to say that he “hated” it, like John Foster Dulles or Joe McCarthy did. In fact, had he been alive during the Red Scare, Douglass might have been thrown in prison by HUAC under the McCarthyite doctrine of “guilt by association.” \n\nFor a person who supposedly “hated” socialism, Douglass sure had a lot of intimate relationships with socialists. It strikes me as odd that a person who “hated” socialism would employ for such a long time [Peter H. Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_H._Clark), the first Black American socialist or that he would be the running mate for the presidential candidacy [Victoria Woodhull]( https://thewire.in/79757/marxist-suffragette-mrs-satan-victoria-woodhull-the-uss-first-woman-presidential-candidate/) the mystic Marxist suffragette.\n\nBut what did he think of labor unions? If we are to believe Damon Root, Frederick Douglass thought labor unions were evil incarnate. \n\n&gt; Nor was Douglass a fan of organized labor. Since most labor unions at the time excluded blacks from their ranks, while lobbying the government for exclusive privileges, Douglass justifiably saw unions as yet another racist obstacle to black economic independence. As he argued in his 1874 essay \"The Folly, Tyranny, and Wickedness of Labor Unions,\" there was \"abundant proof almost every day of their mischievous influence upon every industrial interest in the country.\"\n\nThis is an essay that libertarians also cite prolifically, most likely because its title appears to be a relatively straightforward, and eye-catching, condemnation of unions. Maybe Root is too lazy to look up primary sources himself or maybe he declines out of libertarian principle to use products of wasteful government spending, like the Library of Congress, but one can actually view a [digitized copy of the issue of the New National Era](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026753/1874-05-07/ed-1/seq-2.pdf) that the article was published in. (thanks, big government!). \n\nAside from his concerns about discrimination against black workers, Douglass’ principal beef with unions appears to be that they were corrupt and run not by “industrious workmen themselves” but by “unprincipled demagogues, who control them for their own benefit.” Mostly, the article is a fairly straightforward retelling of a [strike at the Cambria Iron Works.]( https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/04/21/79071683.pdf) But as to Root’s claim that he wasn’t a “fan of organized labor,” it seems kind of disingenuous that he would neglect to mention that Douglass was, in fact, the president of the nation’s first [black labor union.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_National_Labor_Union). His paper The New National Era (aka the same paper Root is quoting)—at the time called the New Era—was the official organ of the short-lived union.\n\nSo in context, Douglass wasn’t critiquing unions generally as an institution, but rather unions as they existed at the time. But Root doesn’t even need to embellish and paint Douglass as anti-union to show his ideals are compatible with libertarianism. His other writings show that he is at least consistent with the position on unions laid out in the liberty party platform, which is to say he believed that union membership should be voluntary and without coercion of any kind. Generally, he thought of unions as a way to achieve the goal of economic equality within the framework of liberal rights, and his views demonstrated concretely the balance between “self-reliance” and “mutual responsibility.” \n\n&gt; It is a great mistake for any class of laborers to isolate itself and thus weaken the bond of brotherhood between those on whom the burden and hardships of labor fall … What labor everywhere wants, what it ought to have and will someday demand and receive, is [an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.](http://www.azquotes.com/quote/1042271) As the laborer becomes more intelligent, he will develop what capital already possesses—that is the power to organize and combine for its own protection. \n\nSo to summarize, Douglass had substantial ideological differences with socialists but he shared their concern about inequality and worked closely them, under his motto “I would unite with anyone to do right, but with nobody to do wrong.” And regarding labor, he supported the idea of unions, but he had many legitimate criticisms and expressed understandable disillusionment with the unions of his time. It also should be noted that he supported the efforts of legislator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts to form a commission that would “investigate the subject of the wages and hours of labor, and of the division of the joint profits of labor and capital between the laborer and the capitalist\" (Side note: This was a [response by Radical Republicans to the Paris Commune]( https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lkc4bfhV9UC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=George+F+Hoar+the+paris+commune&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kTYP0v0gOj&amp;sig=e0-ayC8Vhut3vVJHN5eD4Sk-Skg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJh_njmcrZAhUT6WMKHViiBzAQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20F%20Hoar%20the%20paris%20commune&amp;f=false)) \n \n\n## Douglass on private prisons\n\nBut going beyond broad discussion of Douglass’ view of classically liberal concepts like “self-ownership,” we can look at his positions on concrete issues that have parallel contemporary political questions and judge whether he would qualify as a libertarian today.\n\nFor example, the libertarian position on private prisons is [generally favorable](http://www.wtvm.com/story/19971785/presidential-candidate-talks-guns-prisons), while Frederick Douglass heaped scorn on the forerunner to private prisons [the Convict Lease System](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/fredouconlea.html). He referred to this and the Lynch Law as “twin infamies which flourish hand in hand” and decried how companies would lease convicts, “work them as cheap labor and pay the states a handsome revenue.”\n\nThe main libertarian criticism of private prisons is that their concession process [violates free market principles](https://mises.org/wire/dont-confuse-private-prisons-free-market-prisons), but Douglass was more concerned with the systemic inequalities that caused the prisons to be filled disproportionately with black men and women:\n\n&gt; The second reason our race furnishes so large a share of the convicts is that the judges, juries and other officials of the courts are white men who share these prejudices. They also make the laws. It is wholly in their power to extend clemency to white criminals and mete severe punishment to black criminals for the same or lesser crimes. \n\nDouglass noted the excessive sentences handed down to black prisoners in a Georgia penitentiary, observing that “a large majority of these 1,200 convicts had for simple stealing, without breaking in or violence, been virtually condemned to be worked and misused to death. One man was under a twenty years' sentence for hog-stealing. Twelve men were sentenced to the South Carolina penitentiary on no other finding but a misdemeanor commonly atoned for by a fine of a few dollars, and which thousands of the state's inhabitants (white) are constantly committing with impunity — the carrying of concealed weapons.”\n\nHe didn’t hesitate to liken it to slavery either: “Every Negro so sentenced not only means able-bodied men to swell the state's number of slaves, but every Negro so convicted is thereby disfranchised.”\n\nBut then again, who knows, maybe Frederick Douglass would think the criminal justice system perfectly fair today and turn his attention to more pressing issues like budget deficits or the age of consent.\n\n## Douglass on public schooling\n\nEarlier, when we saw Root rationalize Douglass’ advocacy for an active role of the federal government, he framed it in terms of legitimate “restitution,” but he mischaracterized Douglass by saying he supported universal public education “for African Americans,” when he actually favored universal public education. Full stop.\n\nLike many other black leaders, Douglass supported the ill-fated [Blair Education Bill](http://fordham.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5422/fordham/9780823270118.001.0001/upso-9780823270118-chapter-010), which would have provided federal funding for the establishment of public schools for black and white children. Though black children stood to gain the most from public schooling, Douglass saw it as a universal public good, not merely as a form of “restitution.” Douglass well understood the liberating power of education, since it quite literally freed him: he used his ability to write to forge a fake note from his master, giving him authorization to travel.\n\nAfter it failed to past, Douglass lamented that the Republican Party had become a party of “money rather than a party of morals; a party of things rather than a party of humanity and justice” and later he said “this Congress has preferred protection to commerce and property to protection of personal and political liberty.”\n\nSo in addition to his support for public rather than private schooling, Douglass diverges from libertarian orthodoxy by recognizing that the protection of liberty can at times be at odds with the protection of property, and he really leaves no room for interpretation as to which takes precedence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrederick Douglass was a profound thinker, who beyond doubt deserves a high place within the American pantheon, but it’s also important to note that his thought evolved throughout his life, and we should be wary of those who use partial, ellipses-filled quotations that represent only a snapshot of his massive body of work in order to put a black face on an ideology that’s hard up for non-white exemplars. The 21st century has seen the exhumed corpse of Frederick Douglass propped up in the most odious ways, from the [NRA]( https://www.nraila.org/articles/20140128/negroes-and-the-gun-slaves-fugitives-freemen-and-citizens) to the far-right [Center for Immigration Studies](https://cis.org/Cast-Down-Your-Bucket-Where-You-Are-Black-Americans-Immigration).\n\nI agree with Buccola’s sentiment that what makes Frederick Douglass such a great and unifying figure is that people from all points in the political spectrum can and should find value in him. I’m not opposed to the Cato Institute or whoever else celebrating the aspects of Frederick Douglass that align with their political values, but they can do so in a way that captures his complexity as a thinker. To do otherwise, insults not only Douglass but also the intelligence of Reason’s libertarian readership, who I am sure are perfectly capable of understanding nuance and don’t need things to be oversimplified into some Manichaean dichotomy.\n\nTo paraphrase the man himself, the best thing we can do for Frederick Douglass in the past, is to do justice to him in the present.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

Conact the FFRF or ACLU. This is nonsense\n\nPretty bad as a standalone statement. However, after users asked for a source, he replied with this:\n\n&gt;There's a reason for that. No secular historians are claiming \"Jesus\" existed as a historical personage. The debate over \"Jesus\"' histrocity is a theological question not one actual trained historians weigh in on.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;According to biblical scholars maybe. But something tells me they have a vested interest in proclaiming an actual historical \"Jesus\" (despite the derth of evidence for one).\n\nHere's a quote from Bart D. Ehrman, an agonistic historian and leading NT scholar for biblical criticism, in his [book defending the historical Jesus:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_Jesus_Exist%3F_(Ehrman)\n\n&gt;\"He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees, based on clear and certain evidence.\"\n\nEDIT: I also think it's worth noting that Robert M. Price, a proponent of the Christ myth theory, conceded in his book *The Historical Jesus: Five Ways* that his viewpoint actually went against the mainstream census on Jesus' existence on page 61. \n\nThis denial of the historical Jesus is a conclusion born out of the fear of granting Christianity any authenticity, or as a previous thread put it, \"ceding\" to religion. However, many on r/atheism don't seem to realise that the historical Jesus and biblical one aren't the exact same person; acknowledging his existence has no bearing on whether you think he was divine or not. \n\nOverall, the current consensus among biblical scholars and historians is that Jesus existed, and those denying it are the outlier.\n\nMore stuff from the thread:\n\n&gt;Jesus is not a historical figure. There is no evidence of a real person Jesus actually existing. People will debate whether or not there was some guy preaching around the time who went by the name Jesus. For my part, I don't think there ever was a real Jesus. (I think it was made up at the time they made up the gospels, forty years after Jesus supposedly existed). But I digress. The point is that Jesus is not a historical figure, by any stretch. Jesus is a religious icon.\n\n.\n\n&gt;This would be an interesting thesis of the biography, essentially \"I couldn't find any verifiable evidence that anyone named Jesus of Nazareth ever existed, and all documentation seems to indicate the myth is an agglomeration of multiple myths from several different cultures. \"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/80zyak/if_bob_odenkirk_and_drunk_history_are_both/",
        "text": "[Link to the actual thing](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/wn3ynw/drunk-history-steve-dahl-s-disco-demolition)\n\nNow, I know that [Drunk History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_History) isn't the best source of information (but still AskHistorians approved), but a piece I recently discovered on that show by legendary comedian [Bob Odenkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Odenkirk) is wildly misleading in some aspects regarding the „death of disco“: [Disco Demolition Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Demolition_Night). If you are only concerned about literal errors, words that might be true in any other universe but not in this one for what makes something bad history please look away, because Bob prefaces most of the events with his own opinions (even more than the excellent [Thomas Edison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27CiI-zMsRA) segment, which, for context calls Edison a „cunt“, „greedy reptilian shitbag“ and „demon“ in the last 45 seconds alone), making it hard to see what he'd view as a fact, rather than a blurted out message. It also doesn't help that he's drunk, which could make many statements inaccurate towards Bob's general message, whick is probably „disco sucks“, but let's take all statements at face value.\n\n00:17-00:28 – Not really. The year 1977 has no meaning to this story at all besides „disco was popular“ or „Saturday Night Fever came out“, which in later comments is sort of Bob's angle. Even if Bob thinks disco was created in 1977, he would be mistaken. The earliest succesful disco album was [„Love's Theme“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLTJ95kj9ng), written by [Barry White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_White) of all people in 1973, but hit [#1](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1974-02-09) on Billboard in 1974. \n\n00:31-00:45 – Bob apparently thinks WDAI was a disco radio station in 1977 which it definetly was not. WDAI was a rock and roll station at the time, led (from January 1978-December 1978) by Steve Dahl, the man who he would go on to either praise to the heavens or accurately depict, depending on your opinion.\n\n01:00-01:05 – By 1977 or 1978 KISS did not have a disco record. He is most likely reffering to [„I Was Made For Lovin' You“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlSFmotba2I) which was released in 1979, just two months before the big night. Because of the vagueness of his comments, I'm counting this as bad history because if he had gotten the year right (which he had two separate occasions to do) this would've been accurate. Still no word if KIZZ had released „DIZCO“ by that time, though.\n\n01:29-01:45 – Glossing aside whatever „promotions kid“ was (even though Veeck was the promotions director, a position that in theory is „the promotion kid“ while Schwartz was just a sales manager) Bob is right. Schwartz did tell Veeck about a disco demolition. By Steve Dahl. In a shopping mall. Schwartz, instead of telling Veeck about his plans for Disco Demolition Night, told him about Dahl's plan to blow up a bunch of disco records in a shopping mall. Veeck wanted a similar event, but much larger in scale, to happen in [Old Comiskey Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiskey_Park). Regardless of what Veeck thought of Dahl, Mike probably wanted to attract people to come to the game, with a „follow the money“ approach. If the White Sox were anti-disco, would they have organized a Disco Night in 1977? Schwartz did suggest a promotion with WLUP, Dahl's station, after Veeck, Schwartz and other promotions director Dave Logan were thinking of organizing an anti-disco night.\n\n02:43-02:55 – Dahl was actually suprised about the attendance: he thought the full attendance was going to peak at 5k, instead of the 50k it ended up being. He should have known this because of something I have been ignoring but cannot go on until I mention it. If you look at Steve you can see he's wearing a pin that says „Insane Coho Lips“. Coho, as it's known was to some a fake organization and used to refer to Dahl's fans but for me a group of fans that borderline terrorized the Midwest. Dahl organized several protests regarding disco, in which fans fought the police due to a sold out event, cornered a driver who was promoting WDAI into a park, „occupying“ a disco and attacking a dance floor. Dahl encouraged these events, which should have made him realize the havoc he was going to cause that night.\n\n02:57-03:05 – Oh I bet they were cutting into the grass. Thankfully no one was injured during the game, however think about that for a second. Kids are literally flinging large vinyl records next to baseball players and if a record struck them anywhere, they were probably out for the season. The first disco record missed a player by inches, and it would have hit him in the head too. The statement wasn't really inaccurate, but rather a oversimplification. \n\n05:25-05:39 – Although riot police was sent out and 39 people were arrested no actual fullscale beatdowns happened, and considering the events that had happened prior riot police was probably needed. Rather than just running around the field and reminiscing of the days of Babe Ruth, fans slid down foul poles, lit bonfires on the field and in the stands and also destroyed parts of the stadium. Even Bob Odenkirk, who was born 10 miles from Chicago should know you don't call burning a baseball field „being a teenager“.\n\n05:45-06:05 – Either the alcohol supply was running low or it was getting too high. What the hell does tweeting in the 1970s have to do with disco? Doesn't he understand how meaningless it would be if a bunch of kids just tweeted „I don't like disco that much. Okay?“ Also if it did not kill disco, why did most disco stations like WDAI and WKTU switch to other formats by 1981, along with denouncements from Nile Rodgers of Chic, Gloria Gaynor and the Bee Gees? Coincidentally, Chic's last album before the event was placed at #5 on Billboard while their next was #30. Similarly Gloria Gaynor's last album was #4 while her next was #58. Last but not least the Bee Gees finished #1 for Spirits Having Flown in February 1979 but for Living Eyes in 1981 they got #30, their lowest placing album until 2005. It sure didn't kill disco, it just sent a tweet.\n\n06:42-06:48 – I cut out a previous part that went along the lines of „It was an event that said we didn't need disco 24/7 because I felt it was too mean and too opinionated but this one is just unforgivable. Even if you don't like disco, just calling it shit doesn't do the service it provided. Disco was one of the first musical genres to effectively use electronic equipment like the [Technics SL-1200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200) or the [Yamaha GX-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_GX-1). The music that came out after disco wasn't nothing either, remember, post-disco music lead to synthpop, new wave and of course everyone's favourite, italo. Disco's high-tempo lead to early hip hop music, which would lead to rap. Even if the lyrics of some songs were nonsensical, a lot was incredibly good, including „I Will Survive“, „Staying Alive“ and yes, even „YMCA“ have profound lyrics which you could ignore thanks to the song being so catchy that most people wouldn't listen to it – but they should!\n",

This broke an Appeasement Agreement between Hit;er And British PM Neville Chamberlain, thus Causing war between Germany And Britain. Both of them had allies, so things snowballed in Europe. The holocaust, however, wasn't mentioned, as it was pretty much kept secret.\n\nOne could mention America, but what caused America to enter the war was Pearl harbor, and their allies soon followed.\n\nRussia? They started because Germany invaded them.\n\nIn fact, American and Russian troops actually followed the train tracks to Concentration Camps because they thought the camps were storage bases. And they took pictures of the camps, which made people aware of the Holocaust.",

The cartoon then shows a third level, where people have digested that complexity and get back to a version of the simple understanding (recognizing that Hitler was bad), but suggests that a lot of people, when confronted with the second stage of complexity, decide that they were LIED TO and that HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG! \n\nI'd love to get my hands on this for a class I'm teaching.

        "text": "This isn't even an article about history, [it's an article about an architectural award](https://www.arch2o.com/peter-pichler-architecture-wins-massive-project-china/), but I still felt the need to be very angry. \n\n&gt;Interestingly, the project is located in Taiping, a city in southwestern China known for the prominent historical event known as the 19th-century Taiping rebellion.\n\nUntil reading this article the only city called Taiping that I knew of was in Malaysia, and let me tell you I have read a ~~*lot*~~ sizeable amount on the Taiping^*, so I'm pretty sure I would have noticed a place called Taiping had it actually, you know, been involved. \n\nThis is combined with a clear case of r/badgeography as well, so I provide here a [map of the Taiping and Qing territories with provincial boundaries marked](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Taiping2.PNG). Now, the actual 'city of Taiping' is apparently '30 kilometres from Kunming', and must therefore be firmly within in Yunnan Province. (I mean it doesn't even get a [page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping) so I don't even know [which of the several Taipings in Yunnan](https://www.google.com/maps/search/taiping+yunnan/@24.6967574,100.1364939,7z/data=!3m1!4b1) is being referred to, especially given that all of those Taipings are 100+ km away.) The Taiping Rebellion *did not reach Yunnan*. It began in Guangxi, migrated briefly into Guizhou before sweeping into Hunan, then settled in Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei and southern Jiangsu, and sent a two-pronged northern expedition to Beijing passing through Henan, Shandong, Shanxi and Zhili. Shi Dakai's expedition in 1856-63 was focussed almost exclusively on Sichuan. ~~Nowhere have I ever found reference to even the slightest Taiping activity in the entire province of Yunnan, let alone a town named Taiping near Kunming (then Yunnanfu).~~ EDIT: according to u/Lithide Shi Dakai's expedition did spill over into Yunnan. It still remains that Yunnan was not the centre of rebellion, and the relatively central province capital of Kunming was not directly affected by the Taiping.\n\nWhat Yunnan did experience in the 1850s was not the Christian Taiping Rebellion but the *Muslim* Panthay Rebellion, which although less glamorous still killed around 1 million people. But the badhistory isn't over just yet, oh no.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, the city of Taiping is more popularly known for the mid-1800’s rebellion, when the Manchu-led Qing dynasty fought against Christian millenarian movement [sic] of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The civil war or rebellion took place began [sic] in 1850 and ended in 1864.\n\nThere should honestly be [sic]s after 1850 and 1864 as well. Although clashes between God-Worshippers and Imperials had begun in December 1850, the foundation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (and hence the start of the actual Taiping Rebellion proper) was on (IIRC) 11 February 1851. Furthermore, the southern territories of the Taiping remained until 1866, and the last of Shi Dakai's forces were not wiped out until 1871. Whilst the fall of Nanjing ended hopes for the movement, it was not the actual end, in the same manner as Waterloo, which happened 80 days into the Hundred Days.\n\nTL;DR: Taiping in Yunnan cannot have been known for the Taiping Rebellion because the Taiping Rebellion did not even involve ~~Yunnan~~ the part of Yunnan in question.\n\n^* Including but not limited to: Jonathan Spence, *God's Chinese Son* (1996); Stephen R. Platt, *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom* (2012); Franz Michael, *The Taiping Rebellion* (1966); Philip A. Kuhn, *Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China* (1970); Richard J.

        "text": "I always look forward to people debunking Molyneux on this sub, but instead of waiting for another morsel I decided to add my own.\n\nMolyneux [reviewed the remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ4XA7_UmKs) of *It* last year and managed, in the way only he can, to somehow work in criticisms of immigrant amnesty policies by Democrats, the Russian collusion scandal, the suicide of Jim Morrison of the Doors and, a bit after 7:40 minutes in, Franklin Roosevelt's first inauguration speech.\n\nIn a tangent where he blames the 'overcome your fears' message of the movie for supposedly blinding people to real world problems, he lurches into the following bullshit:\n\n&gt;\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt said after taking the oath of office in 1933: \"so, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance\"... TOTAL CRAP! We have nothing to fear but fear itself? Oh, I dunno, Frankie, how about a 13 year economic depression that destroys the economy of the country and the freedoms of the west, which then culminates in the most brutal war in all of human history killing 60 million people and spreading democidal totalitarianism halfway across the globe!\"\n\nHe then goes on to claim that this speech embodies the way that 'rulers' condition their populations to ignore real problems by dismissing their fears as imaginary.\n\nThis ignores the actual context of the speech. FDR was directly referring to the anxiety Americans had about the depression.\n\nI assume readers of this sub will know the speech, but for those who haven't, and more importantly Molyneux fans that stumble across this post, take a look at [this transcript of the speech](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrfirstinaugural.html). Let me put the bit Molyneux quoted in context:\n\n&gt;\"This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.\"\n\nBy the way Roosevelt then went on to summarise the state of the Depression for almost the entirety of the rest of his speech. Hardly trying to distract people from it.\n\nHe was talking about the fear of making difficult decisions. He was urging the American people to give him their trust and support as he made the hard choices necessary to restore the economy, to look optimistically into the future as opposed to feeling hopeless about the state of the nation. \"This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper\".\n\nAnd yes may I remind you this was in a review of that creepy Stephen King clown movie. Perhaps the really scary thing here is that Molyneux's young audience have likely never heard Roosevelt's inaugural address before, and now they're going to come away thinking FDR was some demagogue who misled the American people in the midst of a terrible crisis.",

The SRD thread was on [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/7zh965/how_the_japanese_roll_their_sleeves_up/duo9hmj/) particular comment, which reeks of historical revisionism, determinism, 'weebiness' and worst of all, war crime apologia, for lack of a better word. As a disclaimer, I'm not a specialist in Japanese history, and I do recognize that Japan did pull off a very impressive turn around with the Meiji Restoration. But the comment I wrote this as a response to implies that Japan was always the greatest civilization on the planet, which is simply not true.\n\n&gt;Japan was years ahead of most of the world back then in their isolation.\n\nNo they weren't. Technologically they were pretty far behind until the end of sakoku. For example, almost all of the nation's firearms were matchlock guns, which had been obsolete in Europe for over a century.\n\n&gt;In the 18th and 19th century when voyagers (before Commodore Perry) we're attempting (and failing) to force Japan open to the world\n\nNobody really tried to open up Japan before Perry because there wasn't anything there worth taking that couldn't be gotten elsewhere. The framework of the global markets and international politics that prompted the opening of Japan couldn't have really happened earlier.\n\n&gt;Washing their hands with soap and water, while European Kings and queens took a bath once a month and believed bathing to shorten life. So while everyone in Europe was dying of infections and sickness the Japanese were all set.\n\nThis is mostly a myth about the medieval period, partly stemming from the fact that when a lot of medieval sources talk about bathes, they're talking about lengthy times in public bath houses which were a social affair, not the simple washing of oneself. [Medieval Europeans actually did bath, and did so fairly often.](http://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/did-people-in-the-middle-ages-take-baths/)\n\n&gt;their fabrics we're superior compared to the itchy near potatoes sac level clothing of Europe.\n\nThey had silk. Big whoop, so did China. And I doubt that it was that much more comfortable than the cotton clothes that were being used in Europe.\n\n&gt;Their structured economy and politics we're also more advanced (despite being run by the Daimo).\n\nFirstly, it's Daimyo, not Daimo. Secondly, the political structure of Shogunate Japan was... not good. It was decentralized and weak, a feudal relic of a past age. There's a reason that Japan had to purge itself of the Daimyos before it could modernize.\n\n&gt;They also have paved roads and streets that were well maintained and very clean.\n\nMost cities at the time had paved roads. And I'd like a source on their cleanliness. No city with a high population and premodern plumbing is going to be clean.\n\n&gt;This was so advanced that the Europeans that first went to Japan called it one of the most advanced nations on Earth and how they were very intelligent (they had a lot of mathematical and architectural wonders that the Europeans could not believe) and how they should be one of the world leaders.\n\nI actually study how medieval Europeans viewed Asia, including the first depictions of Japan by Europe. This line is utter bullshit. Marco Polo talked about Japan as a great place full of gold and stuff, but it's doubtful he ever went there, and most depictions of the east at that time were understood to be more symbolic in nature anyway. If you read the depictions of China and India from the time it's the same language used.\n\n&gt;Japan was so advanced and powerful, that they challenged Russia to a war over China and fucking won.\n\nBy the time Japan fought either of these powers it had already ended its isolation period and adopted western military tech and strategy. China was the 'sick man of Asia' during the Sino-Japanese war, long beaten down by the Century of Humiliation, wracked by internal conflict and gripped by the stagnating forces of conservatism. The reason Europe was surprised by the Japanese victory there was because they underestimated how quickly and efficiently Japan adopted western tech and doctrine (which, to be fair to Japan, was an impressive accomplishment).\n\nThe second time Japan fought China was in the 1930s, when China was divided among multiple warlords and autonomous statelets. Once again, not exactly a difficult fight for Japan.\n\nRussia is a bit of a different story. They were still a formidable force at the time of the Russo-Japanese war... in Europe. Russia's Asian capabilities were generally pretty poor, since there's a lot of land in Siberia and the forces were more useful as deterrents against the European powers. Russia's infrastructure was also poor and the railroads were inefficient. By the time most of the Russian army got to the war, it was already over.\n\n&gt;Japan nearly rose to absolute prominence, they nearlyed United Asia under their strong handed rule and through a series of near failures they fell back.\n\nThat's a nice way of saying \"they committed war crimes and tried to conquer a continent but failed because they got too ambitious\"\n\n&gt;Britain who challenged everyone, refused to touch them!\n\nBritain was not a nation of murder hobos. They didn't just go declare war on people because they felt like it. Britain never had a reason to go to war with Japan, they were more useful as an ally to contain Russia. Britain also never declared war on Belgium, but you'll never see anyone talking about how this demonstrates that Belgium was the strongest nation ever.\n\n&gt;Even after an atomic bomb, extreme recession and a declining population, Japan is still a powerful nation.\n\nA powerful nation due to the reconstruction efforts of the US as well as its own populace, but its still headed for a demographic disaster.\n\n&gt;Imagine if they had succeeded. They would have towered.\n\nYeah I can imagine it. It's not a pretty sight.",

The guy was a massive asshole and coward who hated accepting responsibility for failure.\nEdit: I've clearly pissed off the Napoleon fans. So lets keep going, cause fuck that guy. Go read about what the man was actually like. He was incredibly paranoid, insecure, and downright evil. He punished generals who made correct decisions if it made him look bad. He could not stand criticism. He used artillery against civilians. He believed he was the next Alexander. During his expedition into Egypt and the Middle East he massacred civilians, and he planned to go from Egypt up along the coast and through Constantinople in a reverse of what Alexander had done. He didn't get far and most of his victories were against poorly organized locals. Instead he failed at the Siege of Acre, then ordered his sick men be poisoned, abandoned his army to die, and finally marched back to Egypt and demanded a parade in his honor as if he had won some great victory when in fact he had lost completely and betrayed every man who followed him. The penalty for the locals for not showering him with praise was death. He also reinstated slavery in France's colonies.\nThe man's campaigns were there simply to stroke his own ego. He cared nothing for the fact that he was responsible for the deaths of roughly 6 million people, 17 years of constant war, the bankruptcy of France, the loss of France's colonies, and the economic destruction of an entire generation of Europeans. Most of Napoleon's popular image as a great ruler is purely from his own propaganda, and most of his victories were down to pure luck. The man made consistently more terrible decisions all to propagate this idea of his that he was invincible and destined to rule the world. He had such a childish need to win at everything that he even cheated at cards.\nWe like to think of people like Napoleon as great because of their ambition, but he was arguably one of the worst European rulers to come before the rise of Hitler.\"\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/7ze8is/this_years_make_war_not_love_be_like/duofyqz/\nWow a classical Napoleon = Hitler post.

        "text": "[Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/112hlg/a_question_on_korean_poetry/c6iu4yi/)\n\n&gt; I don't know a helluva lot about this [Korean poetry], but I'm gonna attempt answering your question anywho. Hopefully this will inspire someone to go ahead and correct my mistakes.\n\n&gt; For one, the main body of Korean poetry (as far as I know) has been written in Chinese, and according to Chinese literary traditions. The history of writing poetry in Korean is fairly new, and is tied up with radical political actionism after the WWII (check out Ko Un, who rocks). As such it is quite influenced by western literature (I know that Brecht was important).\n\n&gt; That being said, classical East-Asian poetry does have fairly strict framesets for it's different lyrical forms, but they are very different from the western stress on rhyme and syllable, focusing more on efficiency and precision of language. In fact, imgaism, one of the early directions in modernism, adopted this ideal when rebelling against the rather stuffy, neo-classical poetry that was dominating Britain in the early 1900's. This makes critical works on imagism a good way to bridge the gap of understanding between west and east (I've heard good things about Penguin's anthology).\n\nLet's start off by noting that the OP did recognize that they don't know much about the subject and invited people to correct their mistakes. Still, I think it's worth correcting the errors here for a few reasons. First, nobody did correct OP's mistakes until now. Second, OP is a flair in an /r/AskX subreddit, and for good or for bad, we have a sort of authority in Reddit culture. \n\nSo here goes.\n\n---\n\n&gt; the main body of Korean poetry (as far as I know) has been written in Chinese.\n\nThis is true in a way, but wrong in another way.\n\nIn Early Modern Korea, poets distinguished between a genre called *si*, conventionally translated as \"poetry,\" and the genre of *norae* or *ka*, which then and now meant \"song.\" *Si* was always written in Classical Chinese. In 1834, the septuagenarian polymath [Chŏng Yakyong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Yakyong) declared in the fifth stanza of his Chinese-language *si*, \"One Pleasing Thing for this Old Man\":\n\n&gt; Another pleasing thing for this old man:\n\n&gt; To write crazy verse, wherever goes the brush!\n\n&gt; No need to be tangled in difficult rhymes,\n\n&gt; No need to take long with rewrites and corrections.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; I am a Korean man,\n\n&gt; I shall write Korean *si*.\n\nOf course, what Chŏng meant was not that he would write *si* in Korean, but that he would write works in Classical Chinese that was \"Korean\" in a way because it didn't obey the strict metrical rules and rhyming schemes of traditional Chinese poetry. Indeed, Chŏng notes that this very poem was \"written in the style of [Bai Juyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Juyi),\" ninth-century Chinese poet. The poets of *si* all wrote in the Chinese literary tradition, not a Korean-language one.\n\nWhat was the point, then, of Korean-language \"songs\" or *norae*? Let's quote another Korean scholar, the sixteenth-century [Yi Hwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Hwang), who himself versified in both Chinese and Korean:\n\n&gt; Nowadays, in the leisure of my restful retreat, I write poems every time I feel a stirring in my mind. But the poems of today are not the poems of yesterday. It is possible to *recite* a [Classical Chinese] poem, but impossible to *sing* them. To sing, one must write in the language of the people [i.e. Korean]. Generally, the tunes of our country make it so [that all lyrics must be in Korean].\n\nThis reveals the critical difference between Classical Chinese verse and Korean verse in Early Modern Korea. Classical Chinese *si* was strictly literary, only to be read but never sung,^1 while Korean *norae* was usually intended to be the lyrics to one tune or another. So if you think poetry is *defined* as not being intended to be musical, I suppose you could argue that most Early Modern Korean poetry was in Classical Chinese.\n\nI do not believe this is a particularly helpful way to look at things at best, and extremely misleading at worst. The distinction between non-musical verse (\"poems\") and musical verse (\"lyrics\") was very fuzzy at best for many, many cultures throughout history. The earliest compilation of Chinese poems, the *Classic of Poetry*, is widely accepted to have been originally accompanied by music. Greek lyric poetry was accompanied by a lyre (hence *lyric*), but I doubt Sappho becomes any less of a poet because her poems were meant to be sung. \n\nPremodern cultures had a fluid distinction between writing and orality.\n\nAnd besides, virtually all historians of Korean literature do accept  standardized elite forms of Early Modern *norae* as a form of poetry, especially given their strict rules (on which see below) and their lack of meaningless refrains inserted solely for musical purposes (common in both Korean folk songs and fifteenth-century Korean court music).^2\n\nWho wrote these standardized song-poems? Well, the elite at large. The composition of these Korean poems became so emblematic of elite culture that peasants would mock them in popular plays. \n\nHere's an example from the masked plays of Pongsan, a village now in North Korea. This play in particular mocks the vanity of the Confucian *yangban* class (i.e. the Korean nobility). The *yangban* spontaneously begin to compose a terrible example of a *sijo*, a genre of elite Korean-language poetry that features only three lines, and their servant Malttugi responds by singing a (good) song sung by Korean shamans, the implication being that the folk songs of the shamanist peasants (shamanism was scorned by the Confucian elite) is far superior to the nonsense poem-songs of the *yangban*:\n\n&gt; First *Yangban*: Shush! Hey, little brother. Given how we're all *yangban*, it really is stifling just to sit here, isn't it? Let's sing a *sijo* each.\n\n&gt; Second *Yangban*: Good words, brother!\n\n&gt; The *Yangban*: (They sing a bad *sijo*.) \"...Since we are old, we shalln't be young again...\" Ha! (The *yangban* laugh at what they believe to be a poetic masterpiece. Maltukki asks leave to sing his own song.)\n\n&gt; Maltukki: Ten leagues from Luoyang / In those tombs high and low / Which heroes sleep dead there? / Which beauties and belles? / When our lives too pass by / We'll all join them too. [First stanza of a shamanist song dedicated to the house god]\n\nOr to put things into numbers, three of the five people who appear in [South Korean currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_won) (one fifteenth-century king, one sixteenth-century general, two sixteenth-century scholars, and one sixteenth-century artist) wrote elite Korean-language poems. The great statesmen involved on both sides of the seventeenth-century Rites Controversy, like [Yun Sŏndo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Seondo) and [Song Siyŏl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Si-yeol), were composers of both Korean *and* Chinese verse. Even kings and princes (the fifteenth-century king [Sŏngjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seongjong_of_Joseon) or the seventeenth-century kings [Injo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injo_of_Joseon) and [Hyojong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyojong_of_Joseon), for instance) would regularly send letters in Korean verse. Even the people at large began to sing these elite songs. Or at least, modern Korean shamans do in their rituals, and shamanism in Early Modern Korea was simultaneously *the* popular lower-class religion while being scorned by the Confucian elite.\n\nFinally, even the dichotomy between a non-musical Chinese-language tradition and a musical Korean-language tradition falls apart by the seventeenth century, if not earlier. While the most popular genre of Korean-language poetry was always the three-line *sijo* mentioned earlier, there was a much longer genre called *kasa*, of indefinite length. The length of some *kasa* grew more and more in the Early Modern era, up to several tens of thousands of lines by the eighteenth century, while the content of many *kasa* became increasingly narrative. This strongly suggests that these *kasa* were longer being sung and were being read for their narrative instead, even while many other *kasa* were definitely still being sung.^3 Then, even if we pointlessly define poetry as non-musical verse, there *was* Early Modern Korean-language poetry.\n\nIn Early Modern Korea, the two traditions of verse – the always recited Chinese one and the usually, if not always, sung Korean one – were complimentary, and appreciation for both were necessary for the educated gentleman. Saying \"the main body of Korean poetry has been written in Chinese\" is misleading, if not wholly incorrect.\n\n---\n\n&gt; The history of writing poetry in Korean is fairly new\n\nIt really isn't.\n\n**Korean-language poetry in Ancient Korea**\n\nThe first surviving work of Korean history, the *Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms*, has this to say about Korean-language verse:\n\n&gt; This year [29 AD], the people were joyous and comforted, and finally the *Song of Tosol* was first composed. This was the beginning of the song.\n\nWhile this particular work has not survived, the *Chronicle* would have musical-poetic composition in the Korean language go back to the first century AD. The earlier parts of the *Chronicle* are generally not very reliable. But at the very least, this tells us that the Koreans of the twelfth century, when the work was written, believed there had been a tradition of composing poems in their own language for more than a thousand years.\n\nMoving on to firmer ground, by the seventh century AD, the southwestern kingdom of Silla (which would later unify the peninsula for the first time in history) had a flourishing poetic genre called *[hyangga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyangga)*. *Hyangga* literally means \"local songs,\" and as the name would imply, they were songs written and sung in Korean by the Silla elite. The modern Korean alphabet being an invention of the fifteenth century, the *hyangga* poets wrote Korean using Chinese logographs (the so-called *hyangch'al* system, similar to the Japanese *[Man'yōgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana)* system also dependent on Chinese logographs and without separate *kana* syllabaries). Here's an example of how this system would work in English:\n\n&gt; English original\n\n&gt; &gt; In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\n\n&gt; English hypothetically written in an imaginary *hyangch'al* system\n\n&gt; &gt; 引 德 開始媵, 神 創造逸 德 天叱 偃斗 德 地.\n\n&gt; Pronunciation of the above glyphs in Middle Chinese pronunciation, with parts in bold to be read for their phonetic value:\n\n&gt; &gt; **In dək** kaishi-**ing**, Jhin chriangdzhau-**it dək** ten-**chit 'iændou dək** dhi.\n\n&gt; With parts to be read as *translations* from Chinese in brackets and capitalized, with everything else to be transliterated:\n\n&gt; &gt; In dək [BEGIN]-ing, [GOD] [CREATE]-it dek [HEAVEN]-chit 'iændou dək [EARTH].\n\nIf you're questioning the use of the character *chit* to write the English plural suffix -s, in the actual *hyangch'al* system, the Korean genitive suffix -s (pronounced exactly the same as the modern English suffix) really was written with *chit*. As you can tell, *hyangch'al* was far from a consistent or even easily readable system.\n\nDespite these struggles caused by a writing system rather unsuited for Korean, *hyangga* became an important element in the Silla court's cultural life. From the *Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms*:\n\n&gt; In the third month of the seventh year [881 AD], [the king] held a banquet for many ministers in the Imhae Pavilion. After falling drunk, the king played the [*guqin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin) and the ministers around him each composed a song and presented it to the king. So they enjoyed their day.\n\nOr from the thirteenth-century chronicle *Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms*:\n\n&gt; Again, one monk came from the south, wearing a patched cloak and carrying a sack [the attire of humble Buddhist monks]. The king was pleased and invited him atop his pavilion. Looking inside the monk's sack, the king found many accessories for the tea ceremony.\n\n&gt; \"Who are you?\" Asked the king.\n\n&gt; \"I am Ch'ungdam,\" replied the monk.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; The king asked, \"I have heard that there is to be found a most elevated meaning in your *Song in Praise of Kip'arang* [a *hyangga* work by Ch'ungdam]. Is this so?\"\n\n&gt; The monk replied, \"It is indeed.\"\n\n&gt; \"Then you shall write me a *Song to Comfort the People*.\"\n\n&gt; Ch'ungdam obeyed the royal orders and soon presented the new song to the king. The king was struck by its beauty and appointed him as royal prelate, but Ch'ungdam again prostrated himself before the king and refused to take the position.\n\nThe *Memorabilia* also contains a little more than a dozen *hyangga* poems, the only Silla-period works in the Korean language still known today. One work is introduced by noting that \"in Silla, there were many who venerated the *hyangga*. And it was more than once or twice that they moved to tears even the heavens and the earth and the gods.\" Here's the work in question, *Song in Memory of a Deceased Sister*:\n\n&gt; Here on the path of life-to-death\n\n&gt; I stay, afraid, while you have gone\n\n&gt; Without even saying you might go.\n\n&gt; Leaves blown in autumn winds\n\n&gt; This way and that; we who once\n\n&gt; Grew on one branch do not know,\n\n&gt; Any of us, where we are going.\n\n&gt; I shall prepare the way\n\n&gt; to the Land of [Amitabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha), and there\n\n&gt; There I shall wait.\n\n(McCann's translation, *Early Korean Literature*)\n\nClearly, Ancient Koreans cared much for verse in their own language.\n\n**Korean Poetics in Chosŏn Korea**\n\nThe *hyangga* genre disappeared some time around the twelfth century and left less than two dozen examples behind. The dynasty of Koryŏ that succeeded Silla also left a mere two dozen or so works in the Korean language. So far, it might seem that the claim that \"the history of writing poetry in Korean is fairly new\" isn't entirely false; there really isn't much Korean poetry from before the invention of the Korean alphabet in the 1440s under the Chosŏn dynasty, which ruled from 1392 to 1910. \n\nEverything changes after the fifteenth century. The defining genres of Chosŏn Korean poetry, the *sijo* and the *kasa* mentioned above, were probably consolidated then.\n\nAnd once we get to these two genres, any claim that \"the history of writing poetry in Korean is fairly new\" completely falls apart. A 2012 anthology of as many precolonial *sijo* as the authors could find contains 46,000 *sijo* poems, categorized into 6,845 different themes, and even that is almost certainly far from comprehensive. A similar compilation in 1972 only included 23,000 *sijo*,  so the number of *sijo* poems known to scholarship has doubled in four decades.^4 I personally don't doubt that if we sift through enough libraries and family archives, we'll easily find a hundred thousand *sijo* poems or more.\n\nAs mentioned above, the defining feature of a *sijo* poem is that it has three lines (and a specific rhythmic scheme shared by *kasa*, which I'll get to just below). There is virtually no restriction on theme, as to be expected given that *sijo* was the default Korean-language poetic form for all educated Koreans. For example, *sijo* can be moralizing and Confucian (and the second one references a Chinese proverb):\n\n&gt; As the man makes a detour when a woman comes her way,\n\n&gt; As the woman takes a side street when a man comes her way,\n\n&gt; Do not ask the names of those not husband and not wife.\n\n--\n\n&gt; when the husband goes to till the fields, the wife carries the food.\n\n&gt; In giving him the tray, she lifts it to her eyebrows.\n\n&gt; She is thankful for her husband; he is no different from a guest.\n\nOr erotic and vulgar. The first one here makes a pun on the words for \"belly\" and \"boat\" being homophones (*poy*) in Korean:\n\n&gt; I'm cold, so hug me now. I've no pillow, give me your arm instead.\n\n&gt; There's wind in my mouth; let me sleep with your tongue there instead.\n\n&gt; And when the tide comes at night, give me your boat to ride.\n\n--\n\n&gt; I wish I weren't a man; if only I were a [*Paulownia* tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulownia)\n\n&gt; With the inside all hollow, so they'd turn me into a music box\n\n&gt; Then I'd sit on my lady's lap and flirt with her a hundred times.\n\n*Sijo* can be activist:\n\n&gt; A fire burning in my chest is scorching all my innards,\n\n&gt; I go to Shennong [god of medicine] in a dream and ask him for the antidote,\n\n&gt; \"This fire's fuel is loyalty and righteousness, for which I have no antidote.\"\n\nOr profoundly defeatist:\n\n&gt; Do I dream? Do I awake? To the Palace of White Jade I ascend,\n\n&gt; Though the Jade Emperor greets me, the Immortals all shun me.\n\n&gt; Enough! Five lakes and smoky moons [synecdoche for nature] are indeed my lot in life.\n\nThere is supposedly a general tendency for *sijo* to become less Confucian and moralizing over time, but I do wonder how much of that is an artifact of conservation (most surviving *sijo* are from after the seventeenth century).\n\nOne notable development in the *sijo* genre that began in the late sixteenth century and flourished in the eighteenth was the emergence of the *sasŏl sijo* sub-genre. This sub-genre is structurally marked by an extremely long second (and sometimes third) line. Thematically, it generally tends toward vulgar themes or comedic episodes in popular life, and with increasingly less interest in Confucian matters. Protagonists are usually peasants and other ordinary people, and unlike normal *sijo*, the authors of almost all works of *sasŏl sijo* are unknown.\n\nScholars earlier in the twentieth century imagined that this meant *sasŏl sijo* were subaltern literature. We now know this is not the case and that *sasŏl sijo* were written by the *yangban* elite or the \"middle class\" of merchants, doctors, and other professionals, who preferred the long-winded format and the accompanying \"obscene music\" to express socially illicit desires, and as a sort of escapism evoking the imagined simple lives of their social inferiors. (During their parties, the first songs would be *sijo*, and as people got more and more drunk and inebriated, the musicians would change to *sasŏl sijo*.)^5\n\nStill, the sub-genre only adds to the staggering diversity of the *sijo* format, especially in the sort of themes it covers:\n\n&gt; He drinks wine like a horse drinks water; when it's decent food, it's like a horsefly on an old horse's back.\n\n&gt; Two legs swollen with gout, arms thin like a plow adjuster, slanted eyes, hunchbacked, impotent at that – shall I just let my husband be?\n\n&gt; You big metal-welder just out the window! Come sleep here tonight.\n\n--\n\n&gt; Let's drink a cup! Let's drink one more cup! Let's pluck the flowers and count the cups we drink as we drink endlessly and endlessly!\n\n&gt; When I die, no matter whether I am carted off with straw matting wrapped all around me, or moved on a bier covered in tasseled silk with ten thousand men all crying as they follow me, once I go to that forest of silver grass and scouring rush, of sweet oak and quaking aspen, and when the yellow sun and the white moon rise there, and when drizzles of rain and flakes of snow fall there, and when gusts of wind blow there, who then shall ever tell me, \"let's drink a cup\"?\n\n&gt; And when the monkeys whistle on top of your tomb, what good does it do to regret not drinking then?\n\nWhat of the other great genre, the *kasa*? If the *sijo*'s defining feature is the three-line format, the *kasa*'s defining feature is that it is indefinitely long. That allows it to have a narrative, and eventually came to be particularly favored for travelogues and love stories.\n\nAs mentioned above, longer *kasa* were eventually read, not sung. They became easy ways to introduce unfamiliar scenes (again, travelogues) to audiences who might not be sufficiently educated to know Classical Chinese. This was why one man who accompanied the Korean embassy to Japan in 1764 wrote a 8,000-line *kasa* detailing his adventure there (making it longer than the first three *Harry Potter* books). The grandeur of Osaka that he describes there would, of course, not be possible with the restricted format of *sijo*:\n\n&gt; Looking all around me, the terrain seems exotic,\n\n&gt; And how many all the people! A million, I reckon.\n\n&gt; From east to west, the capital of our country,\n\n&gt; Is ten leagues wide, they say. An overestimate!\n\n&gt; Our richest homes may have a hundred rooms,\n\n&gt; And we say a house of earthen tiles is grand.\n\n&gt; The Japanese grandees build thousand-room houses\n\n&gt; And the richer among them line roofs with copper tiles,\n\n&gt; They drape houses in gold; strange luxury indeed.\n\n&gt; South to north, their city counts near a hundred leagues.\n\n&gt; The people's crowded houses leave no room to spare,\n\n&gt; But winding between them: the [River Naniwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodo_River)!\n\n&gt; Is there any other such scene under Heaven?\n\n&gt; A translator in our company, been to Beijing, told us all:\n\n&gt; \"The opulence of China is no greater than here.\"\n\nBut *kasa* did not always have a didactic or narrative purpose in mind. Sometimes, the poet simply wanted to express whatever was on his mind in more than just three sentences. Imagine you're a poetically minded eighteenth-century Korean sixteen-year-old who's going through a breakup. You can write a *sijo*, but maybe that's not enough for your angst. You might want to write something like this (excerpt from a longish *kasa*):\n\n&gt; When we held our hands together, this was what we vowed:\n\n&gt; \"You die and be a flower, I'll die and be a butterfly,\n\n&gt; \"And we'll never leave each other till our youth fades away,\"\n\n&gt; But the human world is talkative, the Creator too was envious,\n\n&gt; And perhaps my love was not enough – so anguished farewell...\n\nIt's only natural that *kasa* would be much fewer in number than *sijo*. For one, *sijo* was the default format. For another, one very long *kasa* is quantitatively equivalent to several thousand *sijo*. So if anything, it's surprising that one 2007 anthology found as many as 2,800 different *kasa*.^6 And with further research, I'm sure more will surface.\n\n*Sijo* and *kasa* were complimentary genres, each with different functions reflecting their different length but nevertheless fully able to cover similar themes.^7\n\nThis, hopefully, was enough to demonstrate that any claim that \"the history of writing poetry in Korean is fairly new\" is entirely false.\n\n---\n\n&gt; [Korean poetry has been written] according to Chinese literary traditions\n\nThe two traditions are qualitatively different.\n\nFirst, is it true that *sijo* and *kasa* often reference the Chinese historical tradition? Certainly. But take the example of the following work, the third and fourth stanzas of *Mournful Song of National Humiliation*, a series of *sijo* poems that together form one longer poem. Written in the context of the Manchu invasion of Korea, when the Chosŏn king formally submitted to the Manchus and gave his sons up as hostages, the poet references two analogous events in Chinese and Korean history.\n\nThe first event is in the context of the famous [Chu-Han contention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention) in China in the third century BC. The two kingdoms of Chu and Han were contending for power in China after the fall of the Qin empire. Xiang Yu, king of Chu, had unfortunately captured the parents of Liu Bang, king of Han. One rhetorician in the service of Liu, named Hou Gong, managed to convince Xiang Yu to release Liu's father Taigong and his wife.\n\nThe second event happens in the backdrop of fifth-century Korea. The Silla kingdom had sent the current king's brothers abroad as hostages, including one prince who was living as a captive in Japan. The Silla minister Pak Chesang offered to rescue the princes, which he did, but on the way he was captured by Emperor Ingyō of Japan and burnt alive (this is corroborated in both Korean and Japanese sources). His wife, longing for her husband's return, supposedly turned into an east-facing stone on Ch'isul Pass.\n\n&gt; Hou Gong is dead; who shall now appease King Xiang?\n\n&gt; For our hardships have but grown after three years of war in Chu.\n\n&gt; And when shall the Han sun rise to make Taigong come?\n\n&gt; --\n\n&gt; When Pak Chesang died, who could know his lord's anguish?\n\n&gt; Who else could have brought back the princes abroad?\n\n&gt; I shall grieve today for the ghost in Ch'isul Pass.\n\nAs we see from this example, Korean poetry made references to history in general, not just to China. It just so happened that the Korean elite was well-trained in both Chinese *and* Korean history and thus well-equipped to draw examples and imagery from both countries' past. There was certainly no attempt to evoke *solely* the Chinese past.\n\nWhat about the actual format of poetry? Let's compare two extremely well-known examples of Classical Chinese and Korean structure, to see how they differ:\n\n&gt; [Chinese poem: Quiet Night Thoughts]\n\n&gt; 牀前看月光\n\n&gt; 疑是地上霜\n\n&gt; 擧頭望山月\n\n&gt; 低頭思故鄕\n\n--\n\n&gt; [Mandarin reading]\n\n&gt; *Chuáng qián kàn yuè guāng* \n\n&gt; *Yí shì dì shàng shuāng* \n\n&gt; *Jǔ tóu wàng shān yuè*\n\n&gt; *Dī tóu sī gù xiāng*\n\n--\n\n&gt; [Character-by-character translation]\n\n&gt; Bed / Before / See / Moon / Light\n\n&gt; Wonder / This / Earth / On / Frost\n\n&gt; Raise / Head / Watch / Mountain / Moon\n\n&gt; Lower / Head / Think / Old / Home\n\n--\n\n&gt; [Poetic translation by Arthur Cooper]\n\n&gt; Before my bed, there is bright moonlight\n\n&gt; So that it seems like frost on the ground:\n\n&gt; Lifting my head, I watch the bright moon,\n\n&gt; Lowering my head, I dream that I’m home.\n\nThere are very, very many genres of Chinese poetry. But with this famous example, let me illustrate a few things characteristic of prosody in regulated Chinese verse after the Tang era (7th-10th centuries):\n\n* All lines in the poem have a set number of syllables, here five.\n* The rhythm of each line is marked by two units, again with a set number of syllables. Here, the two units are a disyllabic one followed by a trisyllabic one. \"Before my bed / I see bright moonlight. I wonder if this / Might be frost on earth. Raising my head / I watch the mountain moon. Lowering my head / I think of my old home.\" The two first characters make a natural unit within the five-character line, and indeed Cooper's translation naturally ends up separating them with commas. **This is called semantic rhythm and is the defining feature of Classical Chinese poetic prosody**, quite distinctive to Classical Chinese due to its propensity for monosyllabic and bisyllabic words.\n* There is a rhyme scheme. In many Chinese poetic genres, the scheme is something like ABCB. Here, we have AABA. The rhymes are *guāng* \"light,\" *shuāng* \"frost,\" and *xiāng* \"home.\"\n* Chinese is a tonal language, and many poetic genres in the language feature a tonal meter scheme based on a harmony between \"level\" and \"slant\" tones. Here, the meter is LLLSL / LSSSL / SLSLS / LLLSL. This is somewhat unorthodox, since the convention that the second and fourth syllables of each line have a different tone is broken by two of the four verses in this poem.\n\nFar from being \"very different from the western stress on rhyme and syllable,\" we see Chinese poetry having a good deal of focus on prosody in the form of rhymes, syllabic schemes, and tonal meters.\n\nWhat about Korean poems? Are they, too, about syllables and rhyming? Let's look at this extremely famous *sijo*:\n\n&gt; [Untitled Korean poem]\n\n&gt; 靑山裏 碧溪水ㅣ야 수이 감을 자랑마라.\n\n&gt; 一到蒼海하면 도라오기 어려오니,\n\n&gt; 明月이 滿空山하니 수여 간들 엇더리.\n\n--\n\n&gt; [In Modern Korean]\n\n&gt; *Ch'ŏngsalli Pyŏkgyesu-ya! Sui kamŭl charang-mara.*\n\n&gt; *Ildoch'anghae-hamyŏn tora ogi ŏryŏoni,*\n\n&gt; *Myŏngwŏl-i man'gongsan-hani suyŏ kandŭl ŏttori.*\n\nClearly, there isn't any sort of set syllable number here. Nor is there any rhyme scheme. So what exactly is it?\n\nAs it turns out, Korean poetry is fundamentally [accentual verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accentual_verse) like English. This is exceptional. Chinese features syllabic verse as we have examined and Japanese verse is based on [*mora*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics\\)), not stress.\n\nLet's look back at the poem, but with primary accents bolded and in brackets, and secondary accents just bolded:\n\n&gt; [**Ch'ŏng**]sal**li** Pyŏk[**gye**]su-**ya**! [**Su**]i **ka**mŭl [**cha**]rang-**ma**ra.\n\n&gt; Il[**do**][**ch'ang**]hae-**ha**myŏn to[**ra**] o**gi** [**ŏ**]ryŏ**o**ni,\n\n&gt; Myŏng[**wŏl**]-i [**man**]'gongsan-**ha**ni [**su**]yŏ **kan**dŭl [**ŏ**]ttori.\n \nWe see that each line has four primary accents which are evenly distributed. We can divide each line into four separate units, each defined by its primary stress and (if applicable) the following secondary stress:\n\n&gt; Ch'ŏngsalli / Pyŏkgyesu-ya! / Sui kamŭl / charang-mara.\n\n&gt; Ildo / ch'anghae-hamyŏn / tora ogi / ŏryŏoni,\n\n&gt; Myŏngwŏl-i / man'gongsan-hani / suyŏ kandŭl / ŏttori.\n\nWhen Koreans read *sijo*, it is conventional to pause where the dashes are.\n\nInterestingly, each of these rhythmical units are also semantic units. Here's what each of these units mean in translation:\n\n&gt; [Translation of each rhythmical unit]\n\n&gt; Green hills in / O jade blue stream / Easy going / Do not boast\n\n&gt; Once reach / Wide sea, when you do / To return / Is hard\n\n&gt; Bright moon / Since it fills empty hills / Going while resting / How about it\n\n--\n\n&gt; [Poetic translation]\n\n&gt; O stream in the hills, boast not of your speed,\n\n&gt; When you reach the wide seas you shall never return,\n\n&gt; The bright moon floods the hills; why not rest a while?\n\nOf course, the parallels between the accentual divisions and the semantic divisions aren't perfect. In the second line, the phrase *ildoch'anghae* \"once reach the wide seas\" is a loaned Classical Chinese sentence and functions as one word in Korean. So a purely semantic division of the verse into four groups would make you pause after *ildoch'anghae*, not between *ildo* and *ch'anghae*. But because accentual demands trump semantic demands, *ildo* is on its own and *ch'anghae* is obliged to be in the same rhythmical group as *hamyŏn*, which would otherwise lack a syllable with primary stress.\n\nFurthermore, the Korean poetic form demands that the two first and two last rhythmical units of each line be organized into semantically meaningful [hemistiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemistich). And indeed, in the translation, the divisions are clear:\n\n&gt; O stream in the hills [first hemistich] // Boast not of your speed [later hemistich]\n\n&gt; When you reach the wide seas [first hemistich] // You shall never return [later hemistich]\n\n&gt; The bright moon floods the hills [first hemistich] // Why not rest a while? [later hemistich]\n\nChinese verse is syllabic, defined primarily by the system of semantic rhythm and secondarily by a rhyme scheme and tone meter scheme. Korean verse is accentual-semantic, with each line divided into two hemistiches and four rhythmical units defined by a syllable with primary stress and usually by semantic coherence as well.\n\nThe two are very different types of poetry.^8\n\n---\n\n^1 Singing Classical Chinese *si* would have been pointless because no Korean can understand unfamiliar Classical Chinese sentences without having the text in front of them. Classical Chinese words in Sino-Korean pronunciation have too many homophones for that to ever work, especially since Korean lost tonal distinctions after the fifteenth century.\n\n^2 E.g. Kevin O'Rourke (*The Book of Korean Shijo*), Kichung Kim (*An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature*), and David Richard McCann (*Form and Freedom in Korean Poetry*), for one, and virtually all Korean historians (정병욱, 박미영, 박이정, 성호경...)\n\n^3 Some historians think there were unsung *kasa* from the very beginning of the genre, but this is a minority view. More generally, see \"가사의 본질과 담론 특성.\"\n\n^4 These are 고시조 대전 (김흥규 et al., 2012) and 역대시조전서 (심재환, 1972).\n\n^5 From 김학성's 사설시조의 담당층, where he argues for the *yangban* as propagators of the genre:\n\n&gt; [*Sasŏl sijo* do not present] a soliloquy on the experiences of the poet's own subaltern class, but instead make them comedic moments to be enjoyed by a superior social class, the *yangban* or those associating themselves with the *yangban*. Thus, although the *sasŏl sijo* may prefer to discuss the habits of the people at large, the assumption that the genre is therefore a lower-class one is a superficial error.\n\nFrom 강명관's \"사설시조의 창작 향유층에 대하여,\" arguing that the Chosŏn middle-class is owed credit and not the *yangban*:\n\n&gt; The genre of *sasŏl sijo* and its liberal use of direct and literal sexual references are not the work of *yangban* aristocrats wearing some sort of mask. They must have been born in courtesan houses, where discussion of sexual activities was freely permitted, or in those entertainment industries where that particular atmosphere of courtesan houses were also to be found... In sum, the middle classes began to enter the entertainment industry in the full force in the late seventeenth century, and it was they who came to dominate the courtesans and the brothels, the core of the industry. The many defining characteristics of *sasŏl sijo* were products of this environment.\n\n^6 한국역대가사문학집성 (임기중, 2007)\n\n^7 There was another genre called *chapga* which I won't go into, but they're similar to *kasa*.\n\n^8 Chinese poetry is extremely complex. For a good introduction, see *How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology* (Zong-qi Cai, 2007), which also has a collection of about a hundred of the better works. For Korean poetry, see \"The Structure of The Korean Sijo\" by McCann and his *Form and Freedom in Korean Poetry*. The *kasa* verse is structurally identical to the *sijo* verse.",

        "text": "**Part 1: Obligatory bit about definitions**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/7wu4m1/stalin_was_a_liberal/\n\nThe bulk of badhistory is in the comments, but first I'll acknowledge that they're in response to some equally badhistory (and badpolitics) that calls [Stalin, Mao, Lenin, Castro, Chavez, and Pol Pot](https://imgur.com/0Rf9OI8) liberals. This is rookie stuff. Liberalism barely has a coherent definition anymore--it implies center-left to left-wing positions in Canada, the US, and Colombia, and center-right to right-wing positions in Australia and France--but broadly speaking, it tends to favor the following:\n\n* Free participation in political life for all citizens\n\n* Accommodation of ideological differences\n\n* Minimal state intervention in citizens' private lives\n\n* Secularism\n\n* Some kind of free-market capitalism.\n\nThe form capitalism takes can vary from social democracy to laissez-faire, but liberalism is *always* at least grudgingly tolerant of capitalism (think Bernie Sanders). The only point that liberals and socialists tend to agree on is secularism (and even that is very shaky).\n\nMao himself wrote a pamphlet in 1937 called [\"Combat Liberalism.\"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_03.htm) He gives some illustrations of “liberalism” that accurately convey how communists see liberalism:\n\n&gt; To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate. Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms. [...] To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue.\n\nFin. Communism ≠ liberalism.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Nazis, in my Social Democratic Party? The answer will surprise you!**\n\nNow, on to the tankie stuff. https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/7wu4m1/stalin_was_a_liberal/du3v00h/\n\n&gt; Might be because liberals side with nazis all the fucking time.\n\n\"All the fucking time\" dooms almost any historical claim (except for the most basic statements like \"the Confederacy was a white supremacist state all the fucking time.\" That happens to be true). This particular argument fails as soon as you get to 1939-1945, during which at least one liberal world power was constantly at war with Nazi Germany.\n\nNow let's move on to the specific bits of badhistory.\n\n&gt; [The liberal German government sided with the Nazis to bring them to power. Not to mention how England and France refused to ally with the USSR to take out the Nazis in the 30s.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/7wu4m1/stalin_was_a_liberal/du4u7hz/)\n\nHalf marks for this. Establishment conservatives like Franz von Papen (who were \"liberal\" in the academic definition) did allow the NSDP into a governing coalition in 1933, and gave Hitler enough power to become a dictator. This was a disgraceful move that nearly led to the death of liberal democracy in Europe, but to be fair, Papen didn't realize that he was signing on for World War II or the Holocaust. When it became clear that Hitler would not be reined in, Papen tried to check his power by publicly denouncing Nazi policies in the [Marburg speech of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_speech). This was too little, too late: Hitler's response was to launch the Night of the Long Knives two weeks later. Liberal-conservative opponents of Nazism, including several of Papen's key political allies, were murdered alongside Nazi cadres whose loyalty Hitler considered suspect. Papen (who survived because of his high social standing) was stripped of power. At worst, Papen *et al.* put political expediency before decency and good sense, and failed to unmake their monster. That's bad, but it doesn't make them Nazis.\n\nIt's lesson that liberals -- in Western Europe, at least -- have learned from. [Germany's current difficulty forming a coalition government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/world/europe/german-coalition-merkel-schulz.html) is the result of Germany's unwritten taboo against letting right-wing populists govern. The same taboo exists in Sweden, where the far-right Sweden Democrats are excluded by all other parties in parliament.\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: Stalin wanted to stop Hitler, but the French wouldn’t let him**\n\nThe second part of the above statement\n\n&gt; ally with the USSR to take out the Nazis in the 30s\n\ndeserves scrutiny too. The author thinks the USSR was itching to gang up with the liberal Western powers and squash the Third Reich. Wrong again. The USSR and the Third Reich maintained formal diplomatic relations throughout the 1930s, which culminated in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the joint invasion of Poland. Even hawkish figures in Moscow like Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, who considered Germany the USSR's chief security threat, thought the Red Army wouldn't stand a chance against Germany, and hoped that deterrence would be enough.\n\nTo help deter the Nazi threat, the USSR *did* successfully politick with the Western powers. This user thinks Western powers turned the Soviets away, but [Franco-Soviet relations actually *improved* by a lot at this time](https://www.jstor.org/stable/150262?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) (JSTOR link, apologies to those without university wifi). In fact, the French and Soviets [signed a mutual defense pact in 1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance).\n\nI also smell the \"Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys\" meme. This meme is made possible by how unimaginable World War I is for us today. Seriously, [look at this graph](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/graphs-maps/interpreted-graphs/life-expectancy-france/) of French life expectancy over time. In 1914, the life expectancy of a Frenchman fell from 50 to *less than 25*. Just to give y’all some perspective, right now America is talking about an unprecedented public health emergency because life expectancy fell by *three-tenths of a year.* This person follows up with this:\n\n&gt; You say that, but between WW1 and WW2, the US, France, and England invaded Russia to support the Monarchy. So clearly they werent opposed to war.\n\nThis statement equates a minuscule overseas military intervention -- [France sent 600 troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War), a fraction of its average single-day losses during the Battle of Verdun -- with a total war fought on one's home soil. If anything, the fact that France did so little to help an allied regime suppress an unprecedented popular uprising speaks to how war-weary they really were.\n\n---\n\n**Part 4: We don’t talk about Poland**\n\nOf course, the USSR ended the decade by entering into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which leads us to one major bit of Nazi collaboration our tankie friend does *not* want to talk about: The Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland. In 1939, the Soviet Union teamed up with the Third Reich *as an aggressor*. This was a case of pure and simple collaboration, and it’s a historiographic masterstroke of propaganda that Russia has been able to claim clean hands in Poland’s suffering as well as it has. Such was the extent of Nazi-Soviet collusion against Poland that pre-determined spheres of interest were drawn up before the invasion, and were honored by both sides.\n\nThis guy doesn’t say anything about Poland, but given the charges he levels against Finland (coming soon, I promise) the fact that he doesn’t mention this episode tells me that either he’s completely uninformed about the outbreak of the war, or he’s arguing in bad faith.\n\nThe Nazi-Soviet partition of Poland actually led to one truly incredible episode: [a joint Nazi-Soviet military parade.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland#Aftermath)\n\n&gt; Even though water barriers separated most of the spheres of interest, the Soviet and German troops met on numerous occasions. The most remarkable event of this kind occurred at Brest-Litovsk on 22 September. The German 19th Panzer Corps—commanded by General Heinz Guderian—had occupied the city, which lay within the Soviet sphere of interest. When the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade—commanded by S. M. Krivoshein—approached, the commanders negotiated that the German troops would withdraw and the Soviet troops would enter the city saluting each other.[107] At Brest-Litovsk, Soviet and German commanders held a joint victory parade before German forces withdrew westward behind a new demarcation line.\n\n---\n\n**Part 5: Perkele!**\n\nNow we get into the badhistory of Finland. Like, *really* badhistory. \n\n&gt; [Finland? They allied with Germany against the USSR]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/7wu4m1/stalin_was_a_liberal/du5ci6s/)\n\nFirst, there’s an extremely important detail about Finland’s involvement in World War 2: Finland actually fought three distinct wars between 1939 and 1945. They were:\n\n1.\t[The Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War) of 30 November 1939 – 13 March 1940, fought against the USSR. This is the one almost everyone remembers.\n\n2.\t[The Continuation War]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War) of 25 June 1941 – 19 September 1944. During this one, also against the USSR, Finland *did* align with Germany and Fascist Italy before making a separate peace with the Moscow Armistice, after which it flipped allegiances, leading to…\n\n\n3.\t[The Lapland War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapland_War) of 15 September 1944 – 25 April 1945, fought *against* Nazi Germany with Soviet support to comply with the terms of the Moscow Armistice.\n\nLet’s actually look at the dates of the Winter War closely: it ended in March 1940, and the Nazis did not back out of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact until they launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. Well, fuck me, you know what that means? *When the Soviets invaded Finland the first time, Moscow was officially on* ***better*** *terms with Nazi Germany than most of Western Europe was.* And again, the Soviet Union had collaborated with the Third Reich in the invasion of Poland. So Finland entered World War II fighting against a Nazi co-belligerent.\n\n&gt; Finland sided with the nazis, and Liberal Germany aided the nazi rise to power. Edit: Oh and of course Sweden sided with the nazis. … You understand that the Finns and Swedes were allowing Nazi soldiers through their country, and allowing them to use railroads and munition outposts to make it easier for them to occupy Norway and Denmark, right? **And that an invasion doesn't fucking justify them supporting genocide.** *[Emphasis mine]* Edit; Besides, the Winter War was over before they allowed German Soldiers to use munitions and railroads, so that argument doesn't make any sense in the first place.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/7wu4m1/stalin_was_a_liberal/duard2x/\n\nYeah, I’m linking to my own argument, but I’ve let this lie fallow for a while. Anyway, an absolute *ton* of badhistory in a few short sentences here. I’m just going to focus on a few bits of it.\n\nFirst, the charge that Finland supported the Holocaust? Completely wrong. Like, as wrong as you can possibly be. The darkest Finnish action during the Holocaust was deporting eight Jewish refugees to their deaths in 1942. [When this story was reported it sparked a national scandal, with mass resignations from governmental posts, and no further deportations were carried out.]( http://jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article8d14.html?articleid=194) Throughout the Continuation War, while Nazi troops were literally on Finnish soil, Finnish Jews worshiped freely, served in the Finnish Army, and Finnish Jews in the army were given leave on the Sabbath. [Per Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Finland#World_War_II)\n\n&gt; Later in the war, Germany's ambassador to Helsinki Wipert von Blücher concluded in a report to Hitler that Finns would not endanger their citizens of Jewish origin in any situation. According to historian Henrik Meinander, this was realistically accepted by Hitler. Yad Vashem records that 22 Finnish Jews died in the Holocaust, when all died fighting for the Finnish Army.\n\nTL;DR: By virtue of the fact that it helped to invade Poland, the Soviet Union literally bears more responsibility for the Holocaust than Finland does.\n\nThe charge of Swedish support for Nazis relies on a selective reading of history, which acknowledges Swedish iron exports to Germany while completely ignoring [Swedish training of Norwegian partisans, and major joint intelligence work with the Allied Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_during_World_War_II#To_the_Allies), both by private Swedish citizens like codebreaker Arne Beurling, and by the Swedish intelligence apparatus itself.\n\nThat’s all I have time for. I worked on this in fits and starts over the past week, so apologies if it’s a bit disjointed.\n\nED: fixed a link",

They put millions into robotics just to produce a good looking robot that is completely 100% useless and can’t do anything other than look nice and futuristic, try comparing the Boston Dynamics robots versus any robot produced in Japan, see the difference for yourself, during the Fukushima disaster, they didn’t have any robot to send there that could be of any use, all their robots can only smile, sing and look cool, but can’t do anything practical. I have done extensive research and i can say with confidence that everything you see in Japan is a copy cat of America or Europe, when the American companies literally created the gaming industry, beginning from the first Arcade games, Nintendo wasn’t even a gaming company, they became a gaming company only after they acquired a license to distribute the American games in Japan. If you look at the early models of Honda, Toyota and their car brands, they are 100% copy cat from the Europeans, mostly the Germans and French. Their movie ‘’hits’’ were too all copies from the American movies. Japan has invented nothing, and copied everything. They copy something created someplace else, change few elements, and then popularize it to the world as their own invention. They have successfully created the myth that they are technologically advanced, because it is in the core of their culture to focus on the image other than the content, they focus on making things look good, rather than actually BE good, they put so much efforts to create this false and twisted image (mask) of themselves and it works apparently.

India, on the other hand, Is large as well as very diverse. There are 31 different official languages of India and 1600 unofficial languages.\n\nUhh... Sure 90% of the population are Han, but China definitely is diverse. 55 other ethnic groups are officially recognized by the PRC government and there are around 300 living languages (according to [here](https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CN)).

People of China worshiped various spirits and deities in their history, even if you ignore all those countless folk religions and ancestor worship since the beginning of time. Famous heroes like Guan Yu were worshiped as deities of war after their deaths. Even in Confucianism there is a concept of Tian, or sky (天). While the concept of \"God\" in Taoism and Confucianism is more closer to pantheism or deism, but it's far from the modern concept of atheism.\n\nAlso Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism etc coexisted throughout history, though at some points one suppressed the other.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;The Harappan civilization or Indus Valley civilization was one of the very first civilizations on earth, which is said to be the ancestor of Vedic civilization of India.

        "text": "The politicisation of the Northern Irish linguistic landscape continues with [this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/aqkJJzR.jpg) from Northern Irish councillor Henry Reilly. It's pretty plainly ridiculous so let's start with some helpful explanations of the terminology used\n\n&gt;Scots - A Germanic language which seperated from English in the Medieval period, distinguished by a greater degree of Anglo-Saxon vocabulary and more influence from languages like Gaelic, Dutch and Norwegian\n\n&gt;Ulster - The northernmost nine counties of Ireland: Fermanagh, Antrim, Derry, Tyrone, Armagh, Down, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal\n\n&gt;Gaels - The indigenous Irish population\n\n&gt;Scotti - A Latin term for the Irish\n\nSo you can see already that Henry is a bit mixed up. Gaels and Scots are (or were) different words for the same group of people. Gaels from Ulster and from the rest of Ireland did frequently go to war and exchange territory back and forth, but this is true for every part of the island, not just Ulster. As for how Gaelic culture came to spread to Scotland, there are two competing theories. The traditional view was that widespread Irish settlement which began around the Mull of Kintyre and spread outwards eventually saw Gaelic culture gain supremacy in Scotland as the Irish became socially dominant, while more recent scholarship suggests that no settlement took place and that what eventually lead to the Gaelicisation of Scotland was the prestige associated with the Dál Riata, which was a wealthy trade Kingdom encompassing the north east coast of Ireland and the south west coast of Scotland. Whichever view you're more inclined towards, it certainly has nothing to do with \"the Gaelic invaders driving the Scotti people out of Ulster\" (if you wanted to be extraordinarily generous, you could say that the Ulaid's difficulties with the Airgíalla and the Uí Néill encouraged them to seek trading partners elsewhere rather than in Ireland, which isn't exactly the same as being driven out).\n\nThe first claim of the Tweet, that \"Scots is the indigenous language of Ulster\", is also the most ridiculous. If you look at any document written in Ireland between when they first became literate and the Norman invasion, it'll be written in one of two languages - Irish or Latin (sometimes a weird mixture of both!). From then on, French and English get added to the mix. Scots isn't historically attested in Ireland until 1571, in a letter written by one Agnes Campbell to Elizabeth I (who, according to her Italian tutor John Florio, spoke Scots quite well). It reads in part:\n\n&gt;It woll ples eower maiestie ken yat I eower maties suitore Agnes Campbell Lady of Cantire in Scotland hes happynit trew my chaunce and potoun to cum heir Irland in zour maiesties rike and is marreid uponn Oneill quha zour maiesties trew subiect...I am maist desyris any erthlie thing that eower grace accept and recive my said husband Oneill zour hienes service and subiectioun quha is verrie earnestlie bent thra.\n\nThere really isn't much more to say here, other than that I'm pretty sure my great grandparents didn't grow up speaking Russian.\n\nSources:\n\n* Dauvit Broun, 'Pictish Kings 761–839: Integration with Dál Riata or Separate Development' in Sally M.

        "title": "Picking Apart the Armour of Kingdom Come: Deliverance",
        "author": "MRPolo13",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7yvidc/picking_apart_the_armour_of_kingdom_come/",
        "text": "Hello ladies and gents.\n\nSo Kingdom Come: Deliverance came out, and with it came out screenshots that allow me to pick apart some of the plate armour present in the game. I don't own the game myself, because I'm poor filth, but I have friends who have it and I've seen one of them play a bit. And I was not amused. Alas, I was concerned when I saw what I saw.\n\nI think it's best for me to pick apart the armours one-by-one. What's interesting is that, fairly often, Kingdom Come gets the *general* shape right. On the surface everything looks great. But the problems really start when any significant level of scrutiny is given to the armour. I have a feeling that they based a lot of the armours off full-contact reenactors, for a couple of reasons.\n\n[So this image comes first](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/kingdom-come-deliverance/thumb/a/a3/Plate.jpg/228px-Plate.jpg). Right off the bat, the breastplate is [based on a real survival example from Churburg](https://imgur.com/007WJTm). This breastplate is most likely from the late 14th century, and had the plackart added to it in the early 15th century to update it. Interestingly, because of this, the real example is much thicker and heavier than even some reproductions of it. The breastplate appears to be Italian, so quite a distance from Bohemia, which would be far more influenced by Germanic armour traditions, anyway, but the time period more or less fits (the plackart is estimated to have been added around 1410, so a bit later than the game), and it's a very interesting breastplate, so I'll allow it. Besides, exports happened. The bigger problem is the lack of shape on the breastplate. You'll note that the extant bulges out sideways a lot more. This is a very common problem with reproductions in general. The globose shape of late 14th and early 15th century breastplates was very pronounced. It'd smooth out slightly later on, though that too depended on the style and region.\n\nIt would appear that around this time period the arm harness in Germany would be different to this. Firstly, in this period the gauntlets, for the most part, continued to be of the [hourglass sort](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/23/32/5d/23325d0d5e851ec25bcc39050cbd0f89--th-century-hourglass.jpg). This means a very short, very flared-out wrists that weren't articulated. I think there might have been a few experimental period examples for this elsewhere in Europe, and indeed [there's an effigy from 1407 showing articulated gauntlets](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/5596/20027/). I have a feeling, however, that the artist either completed the effigy decades after the death of the person depicted, or had no idea what armour looks like. Or both. Anyway these gauntlets might actually be accurate, though not common at the time.\n\nMore importantly, however, the breastplate isn't covered by any cloth. While 'white armour' (which at the time meant armour not covered by any cloth) was popular elsewhere in Europe, it seemed that Germanic family of armours at the time often put cloth over their plate armours. Examples [here](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/3078/2598/), [here](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/872/2988/), and [here](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/664/896/). While you might consider it slightly pedantic, I believe that regional variations in armour and style are very important, and we shouldn't allow ourselves to mix and match armours from all over Europe just because we feel like it.\n\nAlso this breastplate seems very ubiquitous in this game. That's a very big problem, because the real example is an old breastplate that has been repurposed, and so is more than likely to be a one-of-a-kind. That's not to say similar breastplates didn't exist, though they certainly seem rare.\n\nAlso just a note about use of effigies: they're generally a decently reliable source of information. Tobias Capwell quite famously loves effigies, and if one of the de-facto experts on European plate armour finds them fairly reliable, I don't see why we shouldn't.\n\nThe leg harness is a little bulky, but since I'm not very well-versed in how leg armour was formed (there were tonnes of small variations here and there with leg armour that I can't begin to comprehend), I won't say much more.\n\nNow we get onto the helmet. And oh boy the helmets in this game annoy me. You might think that there are too many breadths in the visor, but there are historical examples, [such as this beauty housed in the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw](https://imgur.com/kS5knLI), so this isn't necessarily badhistory. They were fairly uncommon, but existed. What IS wrong is more or less everything else.\n\nThe bascinet (aka the helmet bit) itself is very round. Late bascinets had a ridge running along the top of them, and often it even ended at a fairly sharp point. The possible exception, and one that an earlier effigy I showed presented, is when the bascinet was used as the secondary helmet for a great helm, which despite being a way of wearing armour dating back all the way to early 14th century, seems to have persisted even at Agincourt, and even moreso in Germany and Eastern Europe.\n\n(NOTE: At a different angle, [the shape doesn't seem to be too bad](https://assets.rpgsite.net/images/images/000/063/858/original/kingdom_come_deliverance_armor-1.jpg), though still doesn't seem great for the time period. The bascinet also has a klappvisor hinges, which would have been removed if the helmet had been converted to side pivoting. However, that seems to imply that this is an old bascinet which was repurposed, so the shape argument doesn't work. So the closeup fixes a problem, while creating another. I'm keeping my argument because I think it might be of interest to people).\n\nThe eyeslits are just terrible. My God they're wide. You could fit the Titanic through those bloody things, let alone a sword. Refer to the visor I showed earlier to see what real eyeslits would look like. Thin, difficult to fit a dagger through. The visor was there primarily to protect the wearer, that's why it pivoted so easily - the wearer was protected when he needed to, and when he needed to see he could raise his visor. That's why a lot of deaths occurred from wounds to the face in that time period.\n\nWhat this also doesn't show is that, from what I've seen, the (chain)mail aventail is problematic. There are two different kinds of mail armour we'll discuss: the mail coif and the mail aventail. A coif is a hood made out of mail. An aventail only goes up to attach to the bascinet, and doesn't cover the top of the head that's protected by the helmet anyway. The whole point of the bascinet is that the mail is attached to it, instead of forcing the wearer to wear a coif underneath. From what I've seen very often the mail is not integrated into a bascinet. Furthermore the mail doesn't protect the chin. [Look here](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/664/896/). The mail in the time period ALWAYS covered the chin, then tapered down over the neck. This is very important in armour.\n\nLastly, we have [this monstrosity](http://www.heypoorplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kindgomcomedeliverance1.jpg). I have absolutely never seen a helmet with oculars like  this. And why on good God's earth would I? The oculars in this instance provide a flat surface with many holes. The point of a pollaxe would have a lot of flat space to bite in and penetrate, and at that point it's game over sunshine. \n\n\nAnd it unfortunately goes on. Most armours have very unfortunate, and seemingly easily fixed problems. There seems to be an obsession for keeping BOTH the klappvisor hinges and the side-pivoting hinges on bascinets, which was very rare. Repurposed bascinets would have the klappvisor hinges removed and have the holes riveted over. I have a sneaking suspicion that there was relatively little research on the arms and armour of the Bohemian region from the early 15th century, and instead a lot of the armour was based on reenactors. This is confirmed by a LOT of things that reenactors often get wrong. The mail not covering the chin, for example, is very common in reenactment. 'Sporterizing' gear and thereby making it more dangerous to the wearer through methods like making the oculars wider than they need to be is another. Breastplates being poorly shaped is another. There are a few reasons that reenactors do this. Firstly, and obviously I shall never hold this against anyone, the budget. Plate armour is expensive, and if you want to get into a hobby, you should have every right to. Secondly, many reenactors, especially the full-contact guys such as Battle of the Nations, seem to believe that they know better than people that did this for a living, and as a result often get the wrong impression of how an armour should really work on the wearer. Lastly, there is the rule of cool, which is the bane of many a historian.\n\nThis isn't to say that ALL reenactors are bad. Hell, pretty much all reenactors I've met are really nice people who are genuinely fascinated in the time period as I am. The problems really start when their word is taken as gospel, and no further research is done, and that unfortunately is how the vast majority of people will get their history. So the myth that all Medieval swords were blunt clubs persists and is reinforced by BoN and others, without the given caveat that these sports have very little actual historical basis. This seems to be what happened here: relatively little research into real period examples has been done, and as a result the historical accuracy of armour in this game suffers. This is an even greater shame because museums LOVE to jump on every opportunity they can to help out people who want to present history. I recently went to the Polish Army Museum, and the curators there were fascinating to talk to and said that they very often get budding armourers (as I wish to be once I can actually afford the startup costs) asking questions and getting to handle the extant examples. I know that Tobias Capwell at the Wallace Collection also loves a good chat, and any museum, really, will be happy to share their findings with people who want to learn.\n\nI'll get the game eventually, and I'll look past these problems, because it still looks beautiful and is set in a very interesting time period. But the problems are there, and they're very unfortunate.\n\n\n**Edit: I've now played the game and can say that some of the criticisms aren't necessarily valid. My point about there being no jackets over armour was, for instance, incorrect as the player can choose to wear a jacket if they so desire. I am planning on writing up a follow-up at some point.**",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7you45/not_an_argument_slavery_wasnt_a_race_issue/",
        "text": "In my [last post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7we0ld/not_an_argument_the_free_market_would_have_ended/?st=jdqzqvfh&amp;sh=4659e8ef) about Stefan Molyneux’s video “The Truth About Slavery [(Transcript)]( https://board.freedomainradio.com/topic/38948-youtube-the-truth-about-slavery/),” I focused on his denial of the role of market forces in perpetuating and intensifying the practice of slavery in the Americas.\n\nThat section of the video represented only a small portion. Aside from his obvious libertarian ideological objective, Molyneux has a second objective, which dovetails with the interests of white nationalism: to deny the racial character of slavery while crediting white Europeans with ending it (and writing black abolitionists out of the tale entirely). \n\n&gt; Europeans ended slavery, and therefore, you only ever hear Europeans being blamed for slavery.  This is horribly unjust.  Look, if we want to move the moral standard of mankind further up, which I think we all want to do, let's stop attacking everyone who shows the first sign of conscience and better behavior in the world and only ascribe the blame to them.  Let's not look at European guilt as a mineable resource which you can squeeze with state power to produce the diamonds of fiscal transfers. \n\nHere, Molyneux is arguing against a strawman. No one blames Europeans for slavery as an institution, generally speaking. But it’s a historical fact that slavery in the Americas was distinct in its racial character. The racial caste system created under slavery outlived abolition. Jim Crow laws, which had deep roots in the slave codes, had a lasting impact on American society that is still felt today since there are people still living who were raised under segregation.\n\nFurthermore, “scientific racism” and the other racist ideologies that provided a justification for slavery still have an effect on our society. In fact, Stefan gives a platform to many of the modern-day inheritors of these ideologies, like white nationalist Jared Taylor and Pioneer Fund-affiliated race researchers, such as Richard Lynn, Charles Murray and Linda Gottfredson. \n\nIt’s not so much that you “only hear” about white North Americans with reference to slavery—most people who don’t get their history from Youtube videos know that slavery existed in the Roman Empire or Brazil—it’s that the history of Trans-Atlantic slave trade is particularly relevant to us, which is why it looms so large in the narrative when we attempt to tell the story of who we are as a people.\n\n#A note on sources\n\nMolyneux goes beyond bad history in his “Truth About” series. This isn’t even just poorly applied historiography with an ideological bent. It’s propaganda that mixes unverifiable, untrue and poorly sourced material with a lot of information that—while factually accurate—is presented in a misleading way without context that would fundamentally change its significance. \n\nAfter my last post, I noticed that Molyneux’s videos contain a link to sources. From my attempts to run down sources for many of his more incredible claims, I gathered that his sources weren’t the best, but upon actually seeing his [list of sources]( https://board.freedomainradio.com/topic/38948-youtube-the-truth-about-slavery/), they were somehow worse than I had imagined.\n\nMany were from sites with a [circa-1998 geocities aesthetic](http://www.truthandgrace.com/muslimslavery.htm) that just screams “credibility,” two were anti-Muslim Wordpress blogs and then of course there is that venerable repository of arcane historical knowledge [Rasta Livewire]( https://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-egyptian-hercules/the-forgotten-white-slaves-part-ii-nehesy/).  Much of his “Irish slave” material came from an article by notorious historical revisionist, conspiracy theorist and Holocaust denier [Michael A. Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II#Holocaust) who authored “They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold Story of Enslavement of Whites in Early America.” The book earned rave reviews by none other than Wilmot Robertson, the man who coined the term “ethnostate.”\n\nThe other claims about “Irish slaves” come from the author of “[White Cargo]( https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/reviewing-the-fallout-from-an-influential-but-fatally-flawed-work-of-popular-history-about-white-be6cfc37069b),” which is slightly more credible but still problematic and not the work of professional historians. \n\nOf all his sources, the most credible is the website of the History Channel and the most academic is a lesson plan of a high school history class.\n\nI also tracked many of the statistics on the various anti-Muslim websites he sources back to a single book by South African missionary Peter Hammond titled “[Slavery, Terrorism and Islam](http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=34302).” Hammond is one of those Eurabia-type nutters who believes in a global Islamic conspiracy comparable to the average neo-Nazi paranoia about the Jews. \n\nAnd if using bad sources weren’t bad enough, he plagiarizes prolifically, in some cases verbatim.\n\nFor example, here is an excerpt from the transcript of his video:\n\n&gt; Islam dominated the slave trade from the 7th to the 15th century, but between 1519 and 1815 Europe also joined in the trade in human flesh.  Interestingly enough, it was the European nations that had suffered the most at the hands of the Muslim slave raiders, and under centuries of Muslim military occupations such as Spain and Portugal who dominated the European slave trade.\n\nHere is a line from the Christian site “Truth and Grace” listed in his sources:\n\n&gt; While Islam dominated the slave trade from the 7th to the 15th Century, between 1519 and 1815 Europe also joined in this trade in human flesh. And it was those European nations which had suffered the most at the hands of Muslim slave raiders, and under centuries of Muslim military occupation, Spain and Portugal, who dominated the European slave trade.\n\nCan you spot the difference? Me neither.\n\nHe also copies the entire section that follows almost word for word, but you get the idea. And this isn’t the only instance. I would venture a guess that about 75 percent of this video (and most of his videos) is just a bunch of garbage dredged up from the bowels of the Internet and interspersed with lame jokes and commentary. \n\n# ‘It wasn’t a race issue’\n\n&gt; One, is it has become a race issue for obvious financial gain reasons and reasons of the profitability of victimization in the face of a relatively empathetic culture.  So, it's become a race issue and it fundamentally wasn't.  It was a power issue.  Where the British could get away with enslaving the whites, they got away with enslaving the whites.  When they could get away with enslaving the Africans, the enslaved the Africans.  When the Muslims could get away with enslaving everyone, they enslaved everyone.  When the Jews could profit from their participation in the slave trade, they did and could. \n\nWhile it’s true that slavery in general wasn’t “a race issue” throughout most of history, Stefan goes to great lengths to try to show that American slavery in particular wasn’t racial, which is about as far from the truth as one can get. Its racial character is what made the “peculiar institution” so peculiar.\n\nAs Confederate Vice-President Alexander Stephens said in his famous Cornerstone Speech stating the casus belli of the Civil War (which Stefan claims “wasn’t about slavery”):\n\n&gt; The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization… Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. \n\nMolyneux’s claim that slavery wasn’t “a race issue” rests on two faulty premises: \n\n1.\tWhites were slaves too  \n \n2.\tThere were black slave-owners.  \n\n\n\n\n##Indentured servitude vs. slavery\n\nIn conflating the indentured servitude of whites with chattel slavery, he makes a number of statements that range from vaguely truth adjacent to flat-out false:\n\n&gt; Now, not really known, very often up to one-half or more of the arrivals in the American colonies early on were white slaves—we'll get into that a little bit later.  They were slaves for life.  Generally, the slavery was hereditary.  Some of them were called \"indentured servants\".  So they would sign up or be kidnapped and sold into bondage, and yet these contracts were generally extended at will.  Nobody was really there to enforce them. \n\nSo here we see what historians refer to as “lying.” Indentured servants were not slaves for life nor was their servitude hereditary. Most people learn the difference between slaves and indentured servants in high school history. I don’t know. Maybe it’s different in Canada. Maybe they replace the part about slavery with a unit on maple syrup. But someone like Stefan, who has a [Master’s degree in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux#Background), should know better. I’m sure he actually does know better, but he prefers to chew historical facts up and regurgitate them into the mouths of rubes and racists eager for validation of their prejudices.\n\nThe majority of indentured service contracts were entered into voluntarily—as an anarcho-capitalist, Stefan should consider any voluntary arrangement to be sacrosanct and ethical—and their terms were t usually three to seven years, though the average was around four. Convicts sent to the new world generally had longer terms of seven years or if their crimes were serious, 14. Terms for skilled laborers were on average 20 percent shorter while terms for women were on average 1.5 years shorter due to the shortage of women. Contracts could be extended, but it wasn’t “at will.” Usually they were extended as a punishment for attempting to escape or some other infraction. \n\nThere were laws and regulations governing the institution and explicitly differentiating between it and slavery. For example, a Virginia statute passed in 1705 on servants and slaves obligated masters to provide servants with a “wholesome and competent diet, clothing, and lodging” and prohibits them from “immoderate correction” or whipping “a Christian white servant naked, without an order from a justice of the peace” for which the penalty is 40 shillings to be paid directly to the injured party.\n \nIt’s important to note that not all indentured servants came of their own free will. Some were kidnapped or became indentured because of debt or as a punishment for some petty crime. Still more were “Barbadosed,” which is a term for Cromwell’s mass deportation of Scots and the Irish mostly to the West Indies and Virginia.\n\nUsually the contract entitled the servant to “freedom dues,” which varied from contract to contract but often included land, livestock, clothing, weapons and some money to start their new life, but it was not uncommon for planters to welch on this obligation, especially in Barbados.\n\nAnd here it should also be noted that life expectancies were short, particularly in the unforgiving climate of the West Indies, where heat and tropical diseases conspired with harsh labor to shorten the lives of everyone—slaves, indentured servants and planters alike. So in many cases, indentured servants would die before they achieved freedom, but many more would not and a lucky few would ultimately enter the ranks of the colonial elite. Nevertheless, this has to be distinguished from chattel slavery, which was, barring an act of manumission, both lifelong and hereditary.\n\nBut instead of noting this difference, Molyneux appropriates the experience of black slave women to white women, indulging simultaneously in the fallacy of relative privation and outright falsehood. \n\n&gt; And, the English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit.  Children of the slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the merchant's workforce.  Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her children would still be born as slaves to the master.\n\nHereditary slavery was governed by the legal doctrine of [partus sequitur ventrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partus_sequitur_ventrem) established in Virginia law in 1662. It stated that a child’s condition would be based on that of the mother, but it didn’t apply to indentured servants, who were legal persons bound by a contract. There was only one circumstance under which a white woman’s child would be born into any form of servitude and that was as punishment for miscegenation. \n\nUnder Virginia law, if a white woman bore a child by a black father, she was forced to pay a fine and if she could not pay, she would be indentured for five years. Either way, her child would be indentured until the age of 30. So the few white children who were born into anything remotely resembling slavery were actually evidence of the fundamental racial character of slavery.\n\nAs for “breeding” Irish women, there’s really no evidence that this was ever a thing. At the same time, sexual abuse of women with less power and social standing has pretty much been a constant throughout history, and most certainly occurred among female indentured servants, but there’s no indication it was more severe than the sexual abuse of slave women.\n\nThe important distinction between indentured servitude and slavery is the notion of legal personhood, or in colonial times, “subjecthood,” which was defined initially in terms of Christianity and blood relation to a subject of the crown. Indentured servants had rights—though not necessarily well enforced—and some form of legal recourse in the event they were mistreated whereas slaves did not. A master could be tried for murder for killing an indentured servant whereas one could kill a slave with impunity.\n\nIn his personal narrative of life as a slave, the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass tells of a time when an overseer shot a slave named Demby in the face for refusing a command. Douglass gives an account of his justification to the master:\n\n&gt; His reply was—as well as I can remember—that Demby had become unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves, one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation… His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence of slaves, and they, of course, could neither institute a suit nor testify against him. And thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives.\n\nDouglass names a series of similar killings to illustrate how common such wanton acts of cruelty were. In terms of indentured servitude, masters were to a certain extent limited by law in the punishments they could inflict on insubordinate workers, but more importantly, they had non-violent options at their disposal, namely extending the term of the contract.\n\nA common tactic of those pushing the Irish slaves myth is to take an extreme example and portray it as typical while purposefully omitting crucial context. In his [excellent series debunking the Irish slaves meme](https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/we-had-it-worse-eebe705c41a), Liam Hogan, a research librarian at the University of Limerick,  addresses a claim that “Irish slaves” would be hung by their hands and have their hands and feet set on fire as punishment:\n\n&gt; This refers to the case of John Thomas, an indentured servant in Barbados who in 1640 was hung from his wrists by Francis Leaver (his master) and Leaver’s brother-in-law Samuel Hodgskins. They placed matches between his fingers and set them alight…It is somewhat ironic that the meme claims that such a punishment was normal for Irish indentured servants. Thomas was likely from England…It is also arguably one of the worst recorded examples of servant abuse in the seventeenth century Anglo-Caribbean. More importantly, as John Thomas was a servant and not a slave, he had the right to complain about his treatment and to hopefully bring his torturers to trial. Both Leaver and Hodgkins were imprisoned and ordered to pay for Thomas’ medical treatment. Thomas was freed from his indenture and paid compensation that amounted to 5,000 pounds of cotton.\n\nHogan then goes on to catalogue the various atrocities visited upon slaves in the West Indies that were the rule rather than the exception. I recommend the reader refer to his page for more, but I’ll just mention one particularly cruel example he offers, which comes from historian Trevor Burnard who writes of master Thomas Thistlewood’s “willingness to subject his slaves to horrific punishments, which included savage whippings of up to 350 lashes and sadistic tortures of his own invention, such as Derby’s dose, in which a slave defecated into the mouth of another slave whose mouth was then wired shut.”\n\nWhile these aren’t examples from Molyneux’s video, he adopts similar tactics by decontextualizing an account of [“white” slave children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_slave_propaganda#Freed_slaves_from_Louisiana) to bolster his case that slavery “wasn’t a race thing.”\n\n&gt; Dr. Alexander Milton Ross attended a slave auction in New Orleans where many of the slaves were much whiter than the white people who were buying them.  In Lexington, Kentucky, Calvin Fairbank—that's the least hood name you'll find—described a woman who was going to be sold at slave auction as \"one of the most beautiful and exquisite young girls one could expect to find in freedom or slavery…being only one sixty-fourth African.\n\nBut when told in full, the tale of these “white” children underscores the racial character of slavery. Here I place “white” in quotation marks because these children, who to the casual observer appear to be white, were considered black under the law. They were part of an abolitionist campaign to gin up Northern support for the cause and to demonstrate the absurdity of the One-Drop Rule, which Molyneux hints at but never really explores. \n\nIt speaks to the dehumanization of the black race that was central to slavery. Abolitionists had to resort to such propaganda in order to elicit sympathy from white Northerners who were otherwise unmoved by the plight of black slaves. The girls with the lightest skin used in this campaign had the greatest impact. Harper’s Weekly wrote of one girl named Rebecca: “to all appearance, she is perfectly white. Her complexion, hair, and features show not the slightest trace of negro blood.” \n\n\n##‘White slaves’ were cheap, expendable\n\nIn the last post, I talked briefly about how the information in Molyneux’s videos often goes viral and can do great harm to public understanding. Mr. Hogan’s work on the Irish slaves myth seems to confirm this. One particular claim that Hogan documented almost certainly originated in “The Truth About Slavery:” the Irish were treated worse because [they were less expensive than black slaves](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TUQlZ4E-jg46NwZJV5i9lA.png).\n\n&gt; So, African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling).  Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling), and this is partly because you could just grab them.  You didn't have to pay the African warlords for the slaves, and they were cheaper and easier to transport.  If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime.  A death would be a monetary setback, but much cheaper than killing a more expensive African. \n \nHere is that same statement in [meme form]( http://showerofkunst.com/sok/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-fNeH9dXQIgl5B8eB8lHUrg.jpeg). In a delicious irony, the true story behind the image in the meme disproves its main claims. It uses a picture of [Elizabeth Brownrigg]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Brownrigg#Trial_and_execution:_August%E2%80%93September_1767), who actually did whip a servant girl to death—not an Irish slave but an orphan named Mary Clifford—and it most certainly *was* treated as a crime. It was a huge scandal that was still being talked about a century later and she was executed for it.\n\nBack to that claim that “white slaves” were cheaper and were treated worse as a consequence. Putting the numbers aside for the moment, B does not necessarily follow from A. We know that slaves generally were treated worse than indentured servants. That’s not really up for debate.  \n\nThough some historians have acknowledged that the economic incentive of protecting one’s investment mitigated the cruelty of some slave masters *to a degree*, the key difference, as we’ve established, is legal personhood. Also, on larger plantations with many slaves, it made sense to use terror as a management tool. As we saw from Douglass’ account of the slave Demby, the death of a slave was considered an acceptable loss if it preserved order on the plantation.\n\nDuring certain periods, indenture contracts may have been less expensive relative to the cost of a slave, but over time, the underlying economic factors changed the cost-benefit equation and prices, which ultimately prompted the shift to slave labor (also after events like Bacon’s Rebellion, rich planters grew fearful of the threat of a growing underclass of free labor and preferred permanent slaves, who were much more manageable.) There is an obvious reason why an indenture contract was less valuable than a slave that had nothing to do with overhead. One provided the owner four to seven years of labor; the other, a lifetime (or more if you include offspring).\n\nSo let’s look at the numbers. Stefan says 5 pounds for indentured servants and 50 pounds for a slave in “the late 1600s.” [This site]( https://erenow.com/modern/atlanticslavetrade1440-1870/43.html) has some historical estimates for slave prices, and for Virginia, it gives a range of 28-35 pounds from 1700-1750 and for Barbados, 16-23 pounds in the same period.\n\nFor indentured servants, the price of a contract was closely tied to the cost of passage and was nearly double.  According to [the source](https://www.fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/efiahlessons/indentured-servitude-activity/) I could find, the cost of passage *fell* to 6 pounds in the 1700s and the cost of a contract was about 10-11 pounds, so we can safely assume that it was somewhat higher during the period Stefan is talking about. I think a reasonable guess would be somewhere around 14 or 15 pounds. So yes, slaves were more expensive for the aforementioned reason, but it was at most double rather than 10 times the price of an indentured servant.\n\nStefan tries to back his claim that the Irish were treated worse with a single piece of anecdotal evidence from Frederick Law Olmsted’s “Journey to the Seaboard Slave States.” \n\n&gt; [Olmsted] was in Alabama on a pleasure trip and saw bales of cotton being thrown from a considerable height into a cargo ship's hold. The men tossing down, somewhat recklessly into the hold, were Negros.  The men in the hold were Irish.  He said, \"What's going on?  Why is it this way?\"  \"Oh,\" said the worker, \"the n*gg*rs are worth too much to be risked here.  The Paddies are knocked overboard or get their back broke, nobody loses anything.\" \n\nOn the surface this seems to confirm Stefan’s thesis, but it’s misleading. There’s a certain economic rationale at work here. A slave is property whereas a hired hand is rented labor, and prior to laws on safety and employer liability, placing a wage laborer in a job that had higher risk of death and injury made perfect economic sense. Manual labor in the cotton fields was relatively low risk, so you could brutally whip a slave and otherwise treat them awfully without lasting damage to the slave as an investment. So this is hardly proof that “white slaves were treated worse.” \n\nAlso, it’s a single account, so there’s really no way of knowing how typical it was in reality, and you can weigh this against the brutality that was the common thread running through some 2,000 slave narratives collected by the Works Progress Administration\n\n\n##Scale of the ‘white slave’ trade\n\n&gt; The economics of Irish slavery were pretty tragic.  From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves.  You see, half a million blacks get to North America, 300,000 whites sold as slaves in a 10-year period. \n\nLiterally nothing in this paragraph is accurate. What I also find amusing is that Stefan is so goddamn lazy that he can’t even be bothered to find precise, accurate figures when doing so would actually help his argument. The highest estimate for the death toll of the Eleven Years’ War—from fighting, famine and disease—is actually around 600,000 based on the Down Survey taken shortly thereafter, and the best estimate for the number of black slaves transported to North America is significantly lower than “half a million” (388,000). You’re welcome, Stef. Learn to Google.\n\nHogan already addressed most of these figures in a [response]( http://www.globalresearch.ca/englands-irish-slaves-meme-the-numbers/5529851) to the article that that Stefan is using, so I’ll mostly just quote him, but first I wanted to just call attention to what Molyneux is doing here. \n\nHe is not content to make a false equivalence between slaves and indentured servants qualitatively, he has to attempt to demonstrate that the two were were roughly the same quantitatively, even to the point of implying that there may have been more “Irish slaves” because *only* half a million black slaves were trafficked total while nearly that many “white slaves” were “sold” in just a decade. \n\n\nHis intellectual dishonesty is particularly egregious because his total figure for “white slaves” includes both North America and the West Indies, but he only cites the number of black slaves imported to North America, which accounts for less than a quarter of the slaves imported by Britain (2.2 million). He does this throughout the video to minimize the role of Europeans, particularly Britain, in the slave trade. Furthermore, it should be noted that focusing only on the number of slaves imported obscures the true scale of slavery since at the time of emancipation the slave population was nearly 4 million.\n\n\nBut even if we were doing an apples-to-apples comparison, Stefan’s numbers are way off the mark. Hogan looked into the 300,000 figure, which he traced back to the [blurb on the jacket of White Cargo]( https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i2K_dvX9vNSh4h07vUHxMQ.png), and notes that from 1630 to 1775, the total migration from Ireland to the colonies was only 165,000. During the entire colonial period about 500,000 Europeans migrated, of which 350,000 were indentured servants, the vast majority of whom came voluntarily.\n\nCromwell did deport some Irish after the war, but here Stefan errs to the tune of 288,000. Around 10,000 to 12,000 Irish were deported during this period.\n\n&gt; During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England.\n\nAgain, this is sourced directly from “White Cargo.” It’s totally baseless and wildly exaggerated, and since we’ve already established that 165,000 Irish came over a period of 140 years, I don’t feel the need to debunk this further. Next.\n\n&gt; In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia.\n\n\nOf this figure, Hogan writes:\n\n&gt; This exaggerated figure of around 52,000 has lineage. It can be traced back to Sean O’Callaghan’s “To Hell or Barbados.” O’Callaghan incorrectly attributes this number to Aubrey Gwynn. But he either misread Gwynn or has deliberately misled the reader because Gwynn took a guess at 16,000 sent to the West Indies and his total estimate of 50,000 includes the 34,000 that left Ireland for the continent. \n\nStefan again tries to play on the viewers’ sympathies with another story of exploited and kidnapped children\n\n&gt; In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2,000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.\n\nHogan responds:\n\n&gt; The only vaguely accurate statement in the entire article. It was 1655 and it was Henry Cromwell (then Major General of the Parliamentarian army in Ireland) who made the suggestion, not his father Oliver. In the absence of any further evidence, historians are almost certain that this scheme did not proceed. \n \nHogan also goes on to note that kidnapping did occur but English and Irish alike fell victim. See his article for a more detailed exploration of the topic.\n\n\n#‘Blacks owned slaves’\n\nNow we come to the other half of Stefan’s non-argument that slavery wasn’t a “race issue” and it might be convincing on its face if one is totally ignorant of history—which accurately describes the majority of his viewership.\n\n&gt; Blacks owned slaves even in America, according to the United States' census of 1830.  In just the one town of Charleston, South Carolina, 407 black Americans owned slaves themselves.  One study has concluded that 28% of free blacks owned slaves, which is far higher than the free whites who owned slaves.  It was a lot of a class thing. \n\nTo refute this, I turn to the work of black historian Henry Louis Gates, whom the reader may remember as the Harvard professor [arrested trying to enter his own house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_arrest_controversy).\n\nOn the Root website, which Gates owns and operates, he took a sober and honest [look at the question]( https://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436). He notes that, yes, there were black slave-owners, but the truth is more complicated than the “truth.” They collectively owned very few slaves and the overwhelming majority were family members or other slaves purchased as a means of emancipation. Still, a minority purchased slaves for the same reason anyone else did: exploitation.\n\nGates looks at the work of Carter G. Woodson who most extensively studied the year 1830 (the same year Stefan mentions, so we can assume we’re working with the same research). In that year, there were almost 320,000 free blacks, 3,800 of whom owned slaves, so that comes to about 1.2 percent, not 28 percent. They owned 12,900 of the more than 2,000,000 slaves at the time, which translates to 0.6 percent of the total.\n\nBroken down by number of slaves owned, 94 percent owned from one to nine, while 42 percent owned only one, and Gates argues:\n\n&gt; It is reasonable to assume that the 42 percent of the free black slave owners who owned just one slave probably owned a family member to protect that person, as did many of the other black slave owners who owned only slightly larger numbers of slaves… Moreover, Woodson explains, \"Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms.\" In other words, these black slave-owners, the clear majority, cleverly used the system of slavery to protect their loved ones. That's the good news. \n\nGates then spends the remainder of the article describing what he calls the “rogues gallery” of black slave-owners who didn’t fit this description, including some who matched their white counterparts in cruelty and avarice. I won’t really go into it here, but it’s a masterful work by an excellent historian who treats the subject with the nuance it deserves. \n\nFinally, we turn to Stefan’s questionable estimate of the percentage of white slaveowners:\n\n&gt;… so, if you include all the white people in the North at the very height of slavery, only 1.4% of white Americans owned black slaves.  Monstrous, immoral… that was the truly evil 1% of the day\n\n[Politifact]( http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/) already did a great job of debunking this claim when it started circulating in meme form late last year, so I’ll just summarize its main points for the convenience of the reader.\n\nFirst, Stefan dilutes the rate of slave ownership by including the population of states where slavery had already been outlawed. Second, a more accurate picture emerges of the pervasiveness of slavery in the South when it is calculated by household, which is the method historians prefer because it cuts down on statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children.\n\nWhile around 5 percent of individuals in slave states owned slaves, nearly a quarter of households owned one or more slaves. In the states that were most dependent on the slave economy, the rate of ownership was nearly 50 percent. In Mississippi and South Carolina, the rates were 49 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Also, one didn’t have to own slaves to benefit from slavery as it was common for slaves to be rented out by their owner, especially if they had some kind of skill.\n\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThere’s a case to be made that the hardships of indentured servants, factory workers, child laborers and the millions of others who have undergone cruelty and exploitation deserve more attention in classrooms and history books. But this can be done without trivializing the experiences of those who endured the evils of what was indisputably the darkest chapter of our nation’s history. \n\nIt’s one thing to honestly portray the trials and tribulations of all of the oppressed in a sincere effort to recognize that suffering is the common heritage of humanity. But it’s another thing entirely to exaggerate the suffering of one’s own ancestors while simultaneously minimizing or virtually erasing that of others’.\n\nIt takes a special kind of sociopath to so heinously distort reality in pursuit of a transparently racist ideological agenda, and then apply to it the stamp of “truth.” \n\nDr. Martin Luther King once said “The truth, when crushed to earth, will rise again.” And looking at the world today, one can’t shake feeling that this is happening—that truth is being crushed, buried beneath fake news, bad memes and the lies of cheap hucksters with Patreon accounts. \n\nMaybe I’m naïve, but I have faith that the truth—the real truth—will rise again, and its light will send cockroaches like Stefan Molyneux scurrying back to whatever dark hole they came from.\n\nThanks for reading. In part three, we’ll look at Molyneux’s claims about “Muslim slavery”\n \n\n",

[...] Point being: mainstream Greek nationalism doesn't care about an obscure semi-foreign Empire that once sat in Constantinople and reigned over all Greece any more than the French Nationalists would care about the Angevin Empire.^1\n\nI stumbled upon this small passage while on my usual half-asleep 8 a.m. morning browse across reddit, specifically through /r/kaiserreich. For those of you not in the know, Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg is an alternative history modification first for Hearts of Iron 2: Darkest Hour, now for Hearts of Iron IV. The short version: Germany has won WWI / the Weltkrieg and has proudly enjoyed supremacy over most of Europe for 15 years, but in 1936, things start not going according to plan. [Visit the Kaiserreich wiki](https://www.kaiserreich.wikia.com) for more insight into the often well-thought out lore. Visit /r/kaiserreich for the memes.\n\nNow, Kaiserreich aims to be historically plausible. Not historically accurate, because that would be stupid, but plausible. Which is why for the now over 10 years of existance of this mod, there has been absolute consensus on not many, but at least one thing: No Byzantium. But as mentioned, /r/kaiserreich has been pretty meme-heavy since it was repurposed as a community for the mod about a year ago,^2 and has therefore always taken a liking to Byzantium. That liking exploded into what observers claimed to be \"a shitstorm\"^3 when Paradox Interactive, the developers of Hearts of Iron IV, announced it would soon be possible to create Byzantium in the Vanilla game.^4\n\nThe quotation we'll be dealing with today is an abridged version of a developer's comment arguing against the inclusion of Byzantium. Due to the subject matter of the paper I should currently be writing (Perception of Rome in Byzantium and Gaul in the 6th century), you can imagine feathers were ruffled when I read this argument. Let's start dissecting it:\n\n&gt; Byzantine Hellenism, which is the root of Greek nationalism\n\nAccording to the DNP definition of Hellenism, the word was introduced into the historiographical debate in the 19th century and refers to \"a period approximately between Alexander the Great and Augustus [singularised by] the fusing of Greek civilization with the culture of oriental peoples (with clear dominance of Greek)\".^5 As you may notice, this period ends approximately 450 years before the beginning of what we now call the Byzantine Empire, and about 1200 years before the Fourth Crusade, and the word wasn't reintroduced into the debate until 300 years after the demise of the Empire. It is true, however, that Byzantium has been characterised as \"Roman political concepts, Greek culture and the Christian faith\",^6 but this is due to a simple matter: Many of the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire spoke Greek. This leads us to the next point.\n\n&gt; is largely credited to the fact that the Latin Empire sat on Constantinople for a few decades, which basically resulted in a distinct feeling of \"we are the Greeks, an ancient proud people [...]\"\n\nThe inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire would not have called themselves Greeks. In fact, Graeci (Greeks) was only used as an insulting epithet for them by western rulers and historians, which they protested very strongly against. Their Empire was the Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων (Basileia ton Romaion, Empire of the Romans), and they were Ῥωμαῖοι (Romaioi, Romans) who just so happened to speak Greek (or Aramaic, or Syriac, or any of the other myriad provincial languages). In fact, the whole idea of *imperium* was, already in the Roman Empire of antiquity, connected to a dominance over a multitude of peoples.^7 Even the most ethno-centric interpretations of the Byzantine Empire agree that \"ethnic origins were irrelevant and usually forgotten after the requirements of assimilation were met\".^8\n\nThe short period of the existence of the Latin Empire played only a small role. The Roman Empire is a bit older - in fact, during the exile from Constantinople, in 1246, the Roman State had its alleged 2000. birthday. And even during that period, the Byzantines did not stop to identify themselves as Roman and taking the name of Greeks as an insult. Let me quote a short excerpt out of a letter by the exiled emperor Nikaia Batatzes, written as answer to a letter by pope Gregorius IX in 1237:\n\n&gt; When those who were sent by your Holiness approached my Imperial Majesty they gave me a letter, which they claimed was yours and insisted that it was adressed to me. Yet I, seeing that its contents were absurd, could not believe that it was yours and though that it was written by someone who is extremely irrational, whose sould is full of delusion and arrogance.\n\n[The pope said that Batatzes, in his wisdom stemming from him being a part of the ancient Hellenic race, should not forget the wisdom of the ancient papal throne.]\n\n&gt; That wisdom springs from our genos [people] is said truly. But how did you forget, or, rather, if you did not forget, how did you supress the fact that, in addition to our reigning wisdom, imperial authority in this world was also bestowed upon our genos by Constantine the Great?\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; You demand that we not neglect your throne and its authority. Shall we then, not counter-demand that you observe and recognize our just rights to the authority and power of Constantinople, which rights originated in the days of Constantine the Great and, passing from him through a long series of rules of our genos that extended for about a millenium, has come to us?\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; Even though we have been forced to change our location, regarding our rights to that authority we remain forever unmoved and unchanging, by the grace of God. For he who is emperor rules over an ethnos [nation] and a laos [people] and a multitude, not over rocks and wooden beams, which make the walls and towers.^9\n\nEven in this darkest hour (well, up to that point) of the Byzantines, they were still the Roman Empire, and not just some provincial kingdom of Greeks.\n\nOnwards!\n\n&gt; \"[...] those Latins reigning from Rome (the Pope) can go fuck themselves\"\n\nThe, let's say, animosity between the Byzantines and the Catholic West is also a bit older than the Latin Empire, and in good parts also developed out of the Byzantine identity as the Roman Empire. It's a complex thing, but a few issues can be rather quickly identified: The ecclesiastical differences between the Orthodox East, with the Emperor as Pontifex Maximus of the five Patriarchs, of which the bishop of Rome was supposed to be one, and the Catholic West, were the bishop of Rome one day through to himself \"you know, I should really create a title named Pope and just be that from now on\". Totes. Then first the Frankish, then later the Ottonic usurpation of the title of Emperor, crowned by that \"insurgent\" bishop of Rome... \n\nIt wasn't exactly an easy relationship, as should be expected of one spanning several hundred years, though the obvious low point seems to have been the conquest of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. These are archive meters of academic literature dedicated to these questions, but even pedantry must in doubts err towards actually posting the pedantry, so I'll stop discussing this point here.\n\nAll in all, I'm sure many Byzantine Emperors would have wholeheartedly agreed with the sentiment in the quote above.\n\n&gt; Point being: mainstream Greek nationalism doesn't care about an obscure semi-foreign Empire that once sat in Constantinople and reigned over all Greece any more than the French Nationalists would care about the Angevin Empire.\n\nMainstream Greek Nationalism is something that has been through a lot of development. According to Ioannis Zelepos, the Megali Idea is exactly the thing that built the bridge between a traditional Greek proto-nationalism up until the foundation of the modern Greek state, oriented towards the Orthodox church and the city of Constantinople, and a modern ethnical nationalism after that point, which, influenced by the enlightenment, oriented itself towards antiquity.^10 The key point in this analysis, however, is the vagueness of the term. It did not include a done and sealed foreign policy program; rather, it was a rallying cry that allowed for many interpretations.\n\nBut even in this vague context, Byzantium was hardly discussed. Therefore the single, overwhelming proof speaking against the Megali Idea having anything to do with the restoration of the Byzantine / Roman Empire is negative. It simply did not occur to the leaders of the national Greek movement of the 19th and early 20th century to demand a return to a multi-ethnic empire, because they were building a state for Greeks, not for Romans.\n\nIn conclusion: Even though the Marble Emperor is a cool legend, it is a legend, not a national myth in the kind of those popular before the World Wars / Weltkriege. Its place, and that of the Byzantine Empire in a work of fiction aiming for historical plausibility should be that of a temporary wayside joke roadkilled by history.\n\nThank you for your attention! I shall now return to being a statue.\n\n**TL;DR:** Here's the thing. You said a \"citizen of the Byzantine Empire is a Greek.\"\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a historian who studies Greeks, I am telling you, specifically, in history, no one calls citizens of the Byzantine Empire Greeks. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"Greek family\" you're referring to the multi-ethnic grouping of Romans, which includes things from Italians to Syrians to Egyptians.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a citizen of the Byzantine Empire a Greek is because random people \"call the kinda brown ones Greeks?\" Let's get Turks and National Populists in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A citizen of the Byzantine Empire is a citizen of the Byzantine Empire and a member of the Roman family. But that's not what you said. You said a citizen of the Byzantine Empire is a Greek, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Roman family Greeks, which means you'd call Italians, Egyptians, and other peoples Greeks, too.

That being said, this thread is free-for-all, and you can discuss politics, your life events, whatever here. Just remember to np link all links to Reddit and don't violate R4, or we human mods will feed you to the AutoModerator.\n\nSo, with that said, how was your weekend, everyone?\n",
