        "text": "I know it's a weird comparison, but just hear me out.\n\nIn the United States, dogs (cars) are prioritized over pedestrians, though some infrastructure does exist to separate the two. Dogs (cars) expel waste (pollute) on the streets, and while some measures exist to limit pollution in the form of pet waste bins (carbon regulations), a sizable number of dogs urinate (emit carbon) onto thoroughfares and buildings. Dogs (cars) also emit noise pollution, though not all dogs (cars) do. Large dogs (large cars) take up significant space on sidewalks (roads) and slow down traffic. Dogs (cars) can also be a source of anxiety for some people, and whether the dog (driver) is friendly or not, does not excuse the fact some dogs (drivers) are dangerous and life-threatening.\n\nAlternative pets (transportation) is under constant threat from dogs (cars). Walking your cat or small dog (biking or scootering) puts your pet (you) in danger from large dogs (cars). In the United States, there is a dog (car) culture, where dog owners (drivers) are highly protective and emotionally invested in their pets (cars). This makes opening a dialogue about these issues difficult and combative.\n\nThat's not to say dogs (cars) should be banned from dense city centers. At the very basic level there needs to be infrastructure to support and facilitate service dogs (cars). To be clear this type of infrastructure does not benefit your average dog (car), and only dogs (cars) that provide a service. One should look to Japan to see how they utilize dogs (cars). Dogs (cars) are small and infrequent except if it's a service dog (car).\n\nThere should also be mixed use for dogs (cars) and pedestrians. Parks (public transit) that are dog-friendly (buses) are useful for all involved. Green spaces and landscaping along sidewalks (medians) serve to allow dogs (cars) to expel waste in a sanitary manner (buffering non-motor-vehicles).\n\nWe should also look at penalties imposed for violations of public safety in accordance to off-leash laws (reckless driving). In my city of Dallas, an off-leash dog in a public area appears to incur a fine of $100-200 (30 days in jail or $200 for reckless driving). In comparison, in Hong Kong \\[I can't find what the penalty is in Japan\\], an off-leash dog would land you with 3 months in prison or a $3000 fine (in Japan reckless driving would be 3 years in prison or a $4600 fine). I don't agree with incarceration, but I do think that in the United States we are way too lenient with public endangerment that is easily preventable.\n\n___\n\nI recognize my own biases, I am uncomfortable around dogs and I love cats. I find the concept that dogs can just excrete waste wherever they want disconcerting. People love to complain about the homeless defecating or urinating on the streets, but from my eyes the frequency of that pales in comparison to how often dogs do. Especially with the frequency of when that waste is then ignored by the owner.\n\nBut I do want a solution to urban environments that is conducive to dog-lovers, while being proactive about the issues dogs impose on cities. I am open to hearing your ideas and thoughts (including if you think this whole topic is absurd and a non-issue).\n\nThanks!",

When urban planners are trying to increase density of cities, they don’t realize that this increased density poses tremendous health risks for future generations. The rate of infectious diseases spreading is much greater. Having major cities may also be a risk in terms of safety on an international scale. Also, allocating too large of green areas may create ecosystems in the city that are habitable for ticks, mosquitos, flies, etc. Having porous surfaces that allow dirt underneath to collect rain also becomes a hazard since mold will grow and become harder to remove. \n\nIn an ideal world, greener cities can help combat climate change and create healthier environments to work, live, shop, or recreate. There is also a possibility that going too green could lead to unforeseen consequences for scenarios not thought about. I’m open to hearing thoughts on this.",

        "text": "First off, apologies if this thread is a bit off topic. As someone who loves watching restored historical footage, I've been falling down something of a rabbit hole of watching footage of cities from 50+ years ago, as it feeds into my interests of urbanism and history. Some examples of these videos:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GK0CwIOGHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GK0CwIOGHw)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZwUIEK6uM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZwUIEK6uM)\n\nNow, to clarify, I don't at all want to imply those times were better or are anything we should necessarily yearn for. *But* that said, the cities shown in these historical videos have much less litter (as in trash just tossed in the street) and less garbage (as in trash hauled to the curb) than their modern counterparts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a few obvious reasons for this. One simply being that fitting more people in the same amount of space results in more trash being produced. Another reason being that disposing of trash has simply become more expensive; recycling programs, filtering incineration waste, and not dumping into the ocean are all great things, but they do increase cost overheads. And finally, people produce far more trash per person than they did in the past - 100 years ago the average person produced \\~100 lbs of garbage per year, while the modern figure is over 6 times that.\n\n \n\nSo if garbage is a problem apparent in many cities, what is the most practical solution to it? Stopping the problem at the source by severely limiting the use of single-use containers seems like the best approach, but implementing such a law on a city-wide level isn't realistic. Spending more on cleanup crews and sanitization departments seems like the next best thing, but that's just throwing money at the symptoms of an underlying problem. Is there even a practical solution that can realistically be implemented on a city-wide level to effectively deal with the issue of trash / litter?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/yqp9vm/urban_sprawl_is_not_financially_unsustainable_nor/",
        "text": "\nI would preface by saying that I am personally not a big fan of \"urban sprawl\" and have no desire to live that kind of lifestyle. That said I strongly oppose policies that seek force higher residential on people that don't necessarily want it. One argument used to bolster policies that are designed to restrict urban sprawl is that sprawl is economically unsustainable, however real world evidence shows that this isn't the case.\n\nThere is some evidence of higher infrastructure costs associated with urban sprawl, but this does not necessarily make urban sprawl uneconomical.\nFrom Todd Litman's own Cost of Sprawl study we see some degree of higher infrastructure costs. All the other so-called \"costs of sprawl\" are simply costs of cars and car ownership.\n\nFrom: Analysis of Public Policies that Unintentionally Encourage and Subsidize Sprawl\n\n\"For example, this analysis indicates that sprawl increases annualized infrastructure costs from $502 per capita in the smartest growth quintile cities up to $750 in the most sprawled quintile cities.\"\n\nSo while there is a cost premium, a few hundred extra dollars per person per year would not render sprawl economically unviable nor would it bankrupt governments.\n\nAll the other costs from the study are simply the costs of cars and roads. \n\nEven if you substantially increased residential and employment densities, and substantially reduced driving, you would still have people who drive and you would still need roads for buses, trucks, delivery vehicles, police vehicles, fire vehicles and emergency vehicles. Hong Kong, for example, has some of the lowest car ownership in the world, but they still have cars and roads.\n\nMost of the costs, whether external or internal are merely the cost of cars and car ownership.\n\nFrom \"Putting People First\", by Wendell Cox\n\n\"Nearly 90% of the cost is attributable to personal vehicle use, and is based on a fixed cost per mile differential between the Most Compact (densest) quintile of US urban areas and the four quintiles that are less dense.\"\n\nYou could argue that denser development reduces driving, but job densities have more effect on transit use and therefore driving than does residential densities. Places with higher residential densities tend to have higher job densities as well.\n\nThis paper, \"Making the Most of Transit: Density, Employment Growth, and Ridership around New Stations\",\n https://www.ppic.org/publication/making-the-most-of-transit-density-employment-growth-and-ridership-around-new-stations/\n\n\"Looking across all metropolitan areas in the United States, those with higher density have higher transit ridership, but the magnitude of the relationship between employment density and transit ridership is twice as large as that between residential density and transit ridership. Furthermore, metropolitan areas where employment is more centralized in downtowns have higher transit ridership, even after taking residential and employment density into account. At the neighborhood level, transit ridership is higher both among residents of a Census tract where tract residential density is higher and among workers in a Census tract where tract employment density is higher. And again, the relationship is slightly stronger for workers and employment density.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, employment densities at trip destinations affect ridership more than residential densities at trip origins\"\n\nThis paper, \"New Open-Source Analyses of Transit Job Access and Transit Ridership\", found a very strong relationship between transit ridership and employment density.\n https://ncst.ucdavis.edu/research-product/new-open-source-analyses-transit-job-access-and-transit-ridership\n\n\"Converting that association into an elasticity, if the number of jobs accessible within 30-minutes were to increase by 1 percent, on average stop-level ridership would increase between 0.6 to 0.8 percent.\"\n\nhttps://ncst.ucdavis.edu/research-product/new-open-source-analyses-transit-job-access-and-transit-ridership\n\nThe 2000 Rutgers university study puts the cost of sprawl at a capital cost of 11,000 dollars per unit, which would only be a few dollars per square foot. This cost could be covered by a modest increase in developer fees. Places with very high developer fees would actually be making a profit from it. This cost is comparing dense greenfield development with low density greenfield development. In fact infill development may have higher infrastructure cost than either low density or high density greenfield development\n\nFrom: Regulation for Revenue: The Political Economy of Land Use Exactions\n\n\"the cost of creating an additional unit of sewage or water-carrying capacity may be much higher than the unit cost of existing capacity if the old sewage or water lines must be dug up and replaced with larger ones.\"\n\nhttps://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/new-feudalism-why-states-must-repeal-growth-management-laws\n\nAnother study shows that sprawl does have higher infrastructure costs, but only modest costs\n\nFrom Fiscal impacts of sprawl:\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pbaf.12239\n\n\"From a policy perspective, these results suggest that the median urban county area could experience a decrease in per capita expenditures by encouraging more compact development patterns. However, the practical effects are modest.\"\n\nModest meaning not enough to impact finances that much\n\nWe also have to consider the costs of unaffordable housing, I don't believe denser housing is unaffordable, but places with growth boundaries have unaffordable housing. Growth boundaries make all housing unaffordable. The cost in terms of greater welfare spending, greater homelessness and so forth. This is a case where the cure is worse than the disease. Homelessness isn't purely affordable housing, but it is connected.\n\nCalifornia will spend 1 billion on homelessness.\n\nhttps://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/homelessness/2021/06/02/garcetti-signs--11-billion-budget--with-nearly--1-billion-for-homeless-crisis",

        "text": "\nOne solution to housing affordability proposed by Yimbys is mid rises and missing middle housing (mostly small apartment buildings like 2 plexs and 4 plexs). The problem with such buildings is that the price of land is such that they would be uneconomical in much of the US. For infill development a 2 plex wouldn't generate much more profit at all than single family homes in many instances and thus unlikely to be built even if legalized. Many missing middle housing options would really only be viable if they were greenfield rather than infill.\n\nPlaces that have legalized missing middle have seen only modest increases in construction\n\nhttps://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/9/2/what-if-they-passed-zoning-reform-and-nobody-came\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-21/sb9-housing-bill-uc-berkeley-impact-study-projects-modest-home-building\n\nTo make a meaningful impact on prices you need much more construction. According to Yimby studies you need a 10% increase in development to have a 1% reduction in rents. Development on that large of a scale in big cities requires high rises.\n\nhttps://cayimby.org/yes-building-market-rate-housing-lowers-rents-heres-how/\n\nContrary to popular belief there isn't a gigantic construction cost per square foot difference between low rise, mid rise and high rise.\n\nhttps://estimationqs.com/building-costs-per-square-foot-in-canada-altus-group-statistics/\n\nThe cost of an elevator makes mid rises less economical than high rises and low rises.\n\nFrom: Edge City: Life on the New Frontier, by: Joel Garreau\n\n“Residential structures either have to be less than three stories above the main entrance, in order for you to build them without elevators, or they have to be high-rise. Once you start building a residential structure of concrete and steel to accommodate an elevator, your costs kick into so much higher an orbit that you have to build vastly more dwelling units per acre in order to make any money.”\n\nThe price of land is so high in many markets, that only high rises are economical.\n\nOne study found that in order to have a break even rent of about 2,300 per month, you would need 12 floors in San Francisco. Shorter buildings would require rents of 4,000 a month or higher.\nSource:\n https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3674181\nEdward Glaeser argues that much taller buildings are needed to make NYC affordable\n\n\"In New York City, the price of building an additional square foot of living space on the top of a tall building is less than $400. Prices do rise substantially in ultratall buildings, say over fifty stories, but for ordinary skyscrapers, it doesn’t cost more than $500,000 to put up a nice, new 1,200-square-foot apartment. The land costs something, but in a forty-story building, a 1,200-square-foot unit is only using 30 square feet of Manhattan, less than a thousandth of an acre. At those heights, the land costs become pretty small. If there were no rules restricting new construction, then prices would eventually come down to somewhere near construction costs, about a half million dollars for a new apartment. That’s a lot more than the $200,000 that it costs to put up a nice 2,500-square-foot house in Houston but a lot less than the $1 million or more that such an apartment now costs in New York\"\n\nIn my view any high priced parcel of land should be 40 floors by right",

        "text": "Municipal mergers are extremely rare. They've happened in metro areas in only a handful of scenarios: Nashville merged in the 60s because it's suburbs wanted access to municipal resources. Jacksonville's merger came from a set of criminal indictments as voters wanted to professionalize the municipal government. Louisville's merger happened as a way to save the inner city. And Indianapolis and Toronto's mergers came from top-down reorganization from the state and provincial government and happened for purely political reasons.\n\nI come from Detroit, a city that's been declining since the 50s and doesn't seem to be turning around despite new investment downtown. In my conversations irl as well as posts to the sub, I've floated consolidation/merger as a way of rescuing the city for good and despite mostly everyone I talk to being open to the idea, they always express the opinion that \"other people might not be open to the idea\" despite their own support, so they feel like \"it isn't the right time\" to talk about a merger.\n\nSo....... if repeated censuses showing a declining population isn't a reason to support a merger, what is? How do you even sell a merger to inner cities, suburbs, and rural areas? Most importantly, how do you make a merger not become a suburban takeover of the inner city like what's happened in Indy and Toronto?",

        "text": "In my neighbourhood we have one big 5 lane stroad cutting through the area. Our community is technically its own municipality but is effectively just a neighbourhood of another nearby bigger city, wheat most people in my community work. For this reason, this central stroad is often very busy, as it is the primary connection to the bigger city.\n\nI have recently got a lot into biking, and urban planning. I’m doing a project in school to redo sign a major road, to make it safer for cyclists and pedestrians. I Chose this main stroad.\n\nThe main road is a five lane road, with two lanes of traffic going in each direction, and a dual directional left turn lane (suicide lane) in the middle that turns into a dedicated left turn lane at intersections. The two lanes of traffic are both necessary, given that this is the main road in my community and is often very busy (10-15 cars in each lane wait at red lights during rush hour). One of the ideas I had to make the road safer, is to remove this suicide lane, and replace it with a very thin median, in order to create extra space for protected bike lanes on each side of the road.\n\nMost businesses on the road already have service roads, and the ones that don’t could easily convert part of their parking lots into one. For this reason, the road wouldn’t need the function of the central left turn lane, and the businesses could simply cut their connection to the main road, and use their service roads for access.\n\nThe main worry I have about removing the suicide lane however, is the fact that I would also have to remove the dedicated left turn lane at intersections. My fear with making the inner most lane between the two thru lanes on each side, a turning/thru lane, is that it would lead to more congestion. Cars going through the intersection on the inner most lane, would have to stop and wait for a car turning left, as it waits for space to appear on the opposite side to complete its turn. This would mean lines of stopped cars could appear, simply because one person needed to turn, and the road would become backed up. \n\nI could keep the road wide at intersections, so it can still have its dedicated left turn lanes, but this would mean I’d have to get rid of the bike lanes at the intersection, where many would say they are most crucial.\n\nAre dedicated left turn lanes really as crucial to intersections as I’ve made them out to be? Does anyone have any examples of cities getting rid of dedicated left turn lanes? What are some alternatives to getting rid of the dedicated left turn lanes, if they are deemed necessary?",

        "text": "Hey y'all.  I'm posting this in a couple other relevant subs.  I'm putting together a project for a child development course and I've been trying to find research on a specific topic: does mode of transport to school as a child effect a person's transportation modes and inclinations as an adult?  \n\nI'm focusing mainly on active moves (walking/biking) vs. inactive modes (driving/school bus) and I'm hoping to argue for facilitating active transport to schools to educate kids to have healthy and sustainable lifestyles.\n\nPersonally, I walked to and from elementary and middle school while nearly all of my peers were driven, and now I find myself much more willing than most people to leave the car at home and bike a couple miles even though the local infrastructure is not especially accommodating (small Texas city).  There are inconveniences but they really don't deter me as much as they do other people, even fellow urbanists.  I think walking to school as a kid had an influence and I'm curious to see if this has been studied.  If not, it sounds like a good dissertation topic for anyone who needs one.",

I know multiple people who have had to leave the county and even state to find a place they can afford with a reasonable standard of living. How do we make more affordable housing????",

Many local governments have begun to look at ways to address the issue, that likely include denser development and better public transit. Over time, will affordability improve since many localities are playing catch up on housing needs? Or will housing affordability relative to incomes continue to deteriorate?\n\nThe issue I see is a lot of new developments aren’t affordable to most people. And construction costs are sky high right now. I don’t see how it gets better but hopefully the increases stabilize and affordability to income ratio can come back down to earth. Younger adults are moving to urban areas, so whichever metros handle the issue the best will do better overall.",
