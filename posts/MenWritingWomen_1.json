Do you give it a pass or think he's using the lame excuse of narrator's voice to write like a gross horny old guy?\n\nHere's a quote I had to hit the pause button on and set the book down for the night...\n\n&gt;Seductive eyes! That guard captain back there had them. She and Odrade and Lucilla were alike in this. Few people paid much attention to the importance of eyes when it came to seduction, he thought. It took a Bene Gesserit upbringing to make that point. Big breasts in a woman and hard loins in a man (that tightly muscular look to the buttocks)‚Äîthese were naturally important in sexual matchings. But without the eyes, the rest of it could go for nothing. **Eyes were essential. You could drown in the right kind of eyes, he had learned, sink right into them and be unaware of what was being done to you until penis was firmly clasped in vagina.**\n\nIt's technically a narration from one of the characters, but it does not fit his persona at all.

        "text": "Since this sub never discuss about another work of Tatsuki Fujimoto, Fire Punch, I am motivated to make new one. Fire Punch manga had done exceptional job of portraying its female characters (or any gender in this matter), and I particularly  like the character named Judah. In my opinion, she stands out as a realistic take on the evil woman trope. For the context, at the beginning, Judah is a woman in highest position in her country with an immense \"magical\" power of regenerative abilities, making her almost immortal. \n\nI had frequently saw power hungry evil woman with great magical abilities and laugh everytime her enemies are murdered. Usually this trope also followed by femme fatal type that use sex and seduction to manipulate mans. But Judah has nothing of it. She didn't laugh when her enemies brutally murdered, she was just like \"Ok that's that, good job everyone. Time to smoke.\" And since she has immortality power, she is afraid of nothing anymore and make her become cold and cycnical that view everything in nihilism take. She feels that everything has become meaningless after living for so long. Everyday, she only does the job, she lies, manipulates and exploits slavery, as if it's just another day of soulless productive day. She didn't feel pleasure from it like most psycopath, but still, she commited the horrible atrocities without batting an eye. In a way, evil people like her scares me the most on how detached they are from the crimes they commit.  \n\nAnd despite having immense power and control over people, Judah is tired of the responsibilities that come with her position, and endless suffering caused her her own immortality. This led her to even ask her enemies to kill her. In my opinion, this kind of character development is not commonly seen in manga, especially in a woman character. But Fire Punch's author, Tatsuki Fujimoto, has done a good job of portraying a nuanced and realistic character.",
