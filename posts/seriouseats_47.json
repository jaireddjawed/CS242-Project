        "text": "Hi,\nI'm not sure if this is a working forum for suggestions for the Serious Eats site, but since Kenji is active, and since there should be a large group of users here, I'll try.  \n  \nJust a few minutes ago I got inspiration to learn how to make a Basil Daiquiri. [I found a recipe at serious eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/dave-arnolds-thai-basil-daiquiri-booker-and-dax-recipe.html), but was immediately confused/irritated as it was a nice combination of fluid ounce fractions, and fluid ounce fractions to cups with a missing magic number.  \n  \nThe receipt tells you how much syrup you should use (by volume), and tells you the ratio of the ingredients, but it does **not** tell you how much you need to end up with that amount of syrup. When trying to find the volume to weight ratio of syrup, I find there is something called degrees Brix, but luckily [a forum](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=689003) tells me this simple rule: *“syrup = water + sugar/2 for a simple rule of thumb”*, so that gives me the missing magic number.  \n  \nI then googled \"4 floz in ml\" and was shocked by the result, as that's 3 times the legal amount in a (sold) drink in Norway. Scrolling a bit up reveals: \"Yield:serves 2\", which clears that up, although it's a bit strange to list a drink recipe in pairs.  \n  \nIn the end, I figured out that one drink is 55 gram rum, 30 gram juice, 15 gram sugar, 15 gram water, 5 basil leaves and a small pinch of salt, as I use a scale for making drinks, but this whole process could have been a lot simpler if your site had the option to switch to metric units, and also to pick the number of servings. For some things, your cups of strawberries et cetera is annoying, but not critical, but for drinks and baking where it's both hard to estimate in metric units, and critical to the right result, it would be great if you could offer the option to list in metric units, and preferably also by weight, even if that means your writers have to punch a few numbers into a web page, or actually use a scale and measure all ingredients used. The same goes for picking number of servings, where your writes could hit a check box if the recipe is scalable which enables a small JavaScript that multiplies the values.  \n  \nSo yeah, great site, great testing and research, I'm a big fan of everything until you get to the unit and values part of the recipes. I have to bring a calculator and a tablet to the kitchen most times when making things, or pre-calculate things and write down on a piece of paper.  \n  \nI hope this is an feature you can bring to your site which would greatly improve the accessibility of your recipes for those of us who cook by scale, metric units, or just single servings.",

Both recommend par-grilling the dough, then adding your toppings and transferring them directly back onto the grill grate to finish cooking. It seems like the pizza stone would at least shield the bottom during this last step of cooking to provide more time for the top to heat through.  So how do you guys feel? Pizza stone or no stone on the grill? Assuming a true stone here - no baking steel for grilled pizza  since it would exacerbate the problem. ",

I mean, I still effed it up by over-reducing but I can still use it - it's just like molasses until it warms up.  I've used it on green beans, carrots, broccoli, chicken and pork chops.  Just this week.  It's the glaze that doesn't quit.  And I still haven't made a dent in the over-reduced solid-molasses like jar I have in the fridge.  \n\nThen I figured out the calorie count for the glaze.  Before reducing, you have about 3 cups at 1400 calories.  But it is reduced to 1 cup.  So are those calories just concentrated?  Do some burn off?  \n\nDo I care?  Not really because you really use so little but I am more curious than anything.  Even at 1400 calories per cup, that is still just 30 calories per teaspoon.\n\nI've roasted, broiled and blanched the veggies then just did a quick saute with the teriyaki at the end.  The steam from the veggies kind of waters down the teriyaki so you have a nice little watery dipping sauce at the bottom of the bowl.  Haven't tried BBQ'ing yet because my kids stole all of my skewers.  For what?  I have no clue but I guess I am good because they are still in one piece (the kids - not my skewers).\n\nTL:DR - Are you just boiling off water when you reduce something or are other things evaporating, thereby reducing the calories from the original ingredients?

        "text": "Yesterday I posted to r/cooking about an unexpected result regarding when to salt burgers. Ever since reading Kenji's article about when to salt ground beef, I've always followed the rule of salting only immediately before cooking.\n\nBut yesterday I tried a little experiment, where I salted the steaks and let them rest in the fridge for a few hours before grinding. I compared this with a burger salted the usual way (just before grilling). After grilling, however, both burgers had the same loose, tender texture and taste. \n\nSure my methods weren't up to the standards of a professional test kitchen, maybe one got a little more salt or heat or something, but what prevented my burgers from getting that sausagy texture like the article says would happen?\n\nBoth were 5 oz with an even mix of sirloin and chuck, coarse ground, loosely handled, and grilled to about 135. I would estimate I used between half and 3/4 of a teaspoon of kosher salt per patty, which is less than the article suggests but I doubt that little extra salt would have caused such a major physical change. \n\nDoes the rest really undo all of the damage the salt caused in the article? Or is something else going on?\n\n[xpost from r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/4oqvw2/questioning_the_wisdom_about_salting_burgers/)",

What weight does the 4 hour cooking time refer to? \n\n2) I'm interested in cooking Galician beef, which I believe has a higher fat content than regular beef due to its age (say 15 years) at slaughter. Would the cooking recommendation change for this type of beef? \n\nThanks all for any advice!",

It said to use a butt roast and slow cook it for 12 hours.\n\nThis obviously rendered the fat and gave it a nice soaking fat bath. So I'm curious, is this technically a Confit? Or does a Confit have to start in fat and then be packed?\n\nI read http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/01/ask-the-food-lab-what-the-heck-is-confit.html#comments and am still a little confused.\n\nThanks for your help!!!",
