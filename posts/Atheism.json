I believe we should live because we do, and that reasoning about the reality of death is not necessary to keep doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've only recently started giving form to these ideas, so this isn't a developed thesis but meant more as a starting point for what I thought would make good discussion.\n\nI believe it is accurate to say that people of all beliefs, or lack thereof, can agree that death is a fact of human experience. There are of course the transhumanists among us who argue that may not always be the case. But at least we can all agree that, without some divine or technological intervention, the human body eventually dies. Here, I don't intend to consider the transhumanist perspective - I'm talking about people who believe their time in this existence is almost certainly limited. (Although I welcome the transhumanist perspective in the comments!)\n\nOut of those of us who choose to believe that we *certainly* *will* leave this mortal plane (a majority of humanity, I think), some are prone to think things like, \"why are we here?\" and, \"why do we have to die?\". The facts are that *we are here now,* and that *we will not always be*. It is natural to want to construct some understanding of the relationship between these two, immutable truths. My intuition tells me, that this (at times) insatiable desire to understand the relationship between our living experience and the fact of our deaths is what drives people to abandon reason in their search for the truth, and embrace what many call faith.\n\nMy view is that these questions simply do not have (in the literal sense) *reasonable* answers. They arise from observations that we *experience* as being *unreasonable* when considered simultaneously, our life and our death. At first it doesn't seem fair, but clearly both are facts, so we assume there must be some reason why both are true. And so philosophy, metaphysics and religion are born.\n\nThat isn't to say though, that just because there is no reason, doesn't mean you should stop living. You already are, you have been this whole time. There is no reason for you to be here, and there is no reason for you not to be. You are, and so is everything else that is. Everything lives without reason. But because we die, and because we are human, we are prone to produce a satisfactory reason to do so. I think this is my central problem with any religion: they are driven by the desire for a reason to die, when the reality is that nothing needs a reason to die, and so there probably isn't one at all.\n\nWhat do you all think?","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678724271.0},{"title":"Religion and Conspiracy","author":"FaeDragons","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11pvxp7\/religion_and_conspiracy\/","text":"One thing I've noticed, being a former Christian, is that religion and conspiracy theorists are so similar, yet so different. Like they're both so extreme for different reasons that they end up being the same.\n\nWhat I mean is, for the religious their thing is they believe what their pastor\/church tells them without question. They believe the bible, without question. To question is to doubt, and to doubt, is to lose faith. And being terrified of hellfire, they can't accept that. They'll defend passages that are disgusting because it tells them it's 'right' even if it goes against any compassion or empathy that a human might have. They're very trusting to their church and pastor. So much so in fact I was told by one that they think satan buried dinosaur bones to trick scientists. A supernatural, unseen demon, placed thousands upon thousands of fossils in layers of rock to trick the world. \n\nConspiracy theorists on the other hand, are so mistrusting, so against 'following a herd' that they basically make up their own reality. They go against any 'mainstream' science as it's called, and calling any scientific organization that doesn't accept their ideas as dogmatic. Like flat earthers, they have it in their heads the entire world somehow has kept it secret that the world is flat for many years. That every field of science, every government, every single person who's been to space or flown around the world as intentionally lying. \n\nBoth of these groups, for the most part, deny science - only wearing it as a hat and claiming they have the 'true' science. Much like people claiming 'quantum mechanics' prove that reality is in the mind. I mean just take a glance at the spirit science channel on youtube and all that woowoo where he claims it's science, but it's just empty assertions and feelings that guide his beliefs. I was stunned when he tried to claim ancient egyptians were actually 50 feet tall because the statues were that size - and that jews are from space. Like, how do you go so far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy where you're both mistrusting and trusting of everything? How can he trust *all* religions without question, but go against 'mainstream science' for being dogmatic and closed minded, and in the same breath claim his channel promotes science?\n\nI'm honestly baffled by it all.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678670155.0},{"title":"Counter Protest - Made the news yesterday!!","author":"SecularInternational","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11pfzhd\/counter_protest_made_the_news_yesterday\/","text":"Hello Everyone!\n\nWent to counter protest to support drag queen story time in a neighboring city after hearing religious people were planning a protest.

He has a youtube channel (which i will not name for i am afraid he will find out about this post) where he talked about crazy shit, and i mean crazy.

If you ever looked at how DNA is built, it spells Yahweh.\" (:redflag: #6)\n\nAnd I had it. I was like, \"Dude. That's not how science works! Coincidence does not equal causality. You're telling me, that 'God', in his almighty wisdom and humility, spelled his own name, into how we define DNA?

We as a species  can't even agree on how to spell or pronounce ALUMINUM?\"\n\nBut wtf is logic to someone like him? He brushed it off and went straight to another subject about his god.\n\nLike, wtf. No means no, bro. Instantly, I felt like a girl who was caught giving a creep a decent human interaction, only to have this guy rape me with \"you need 'God'\".\n\nLuckily, the flight started boarding.

He has always been a religious hypocrite who cheated on his first two wives multiple times (even cheating on my mom on their wedding day with her friend) and wasn\u2019t around much growing up due to his job. When he was around, he was short tempered and had a big ego, so we never really bonded. We still stay somewhat civil with one another, but we don\u2019t talk aside from a message on our birthdays and holiday wishes. He currently lives with his third wife (who was one of his affair partners from church while with my mom) in a different state from where my mom, sister and I live.\n\nSo lately he\u2019s become even more religious and has been following a bunch of crap conspiracy theories (yup. He\u2019s anti vax \ud83e\udd2e) and some skeezy internet televangelist guy that easily swindles money from people like my dad and his wife. My partner, sister, and mom are all agnostic while my BIL and I are atheists. We\u2019ve been very clear with our dad that we do not follow religion and asked him to stop trying to force religious pamphlets on us every chance he gets, which he stopped doing eventually about 6 years ago.\n\nAnyway, so we haven\u2019t spoken in months and one day a package shows up at my door. Inside are two bibles, one intended for me and one for my partner, along with a $50 for each of us lol. He put a note inside that is attempting to explain what the bible is as if we have never heard of the bible before! The real kicker is that these \u201cbibles\u201d are a revised version written by that internet preacher guy he follows.\n\nI immediately texted my sister to see if he sent them to her and her husband as well, and sure enough, when she got home from work they were there. We were both cringing so hard and couldn\u2019t figure out what we should do with them. Send them back to him? Leave them outside of a church? We didn\u2019t want to just throw them away because that\u2019s a waste of paper, but we didn\u2019t want to give them away to anyone and have them be poisoned with that garbage. My sister came up with the idea of selling them to our local second hand book store which scored us $5 per book. We tore the first page out which had our names in the dedication section (ew. lol) and messaged our dad saying basically, \u201cThanks for the money, but we are not going to use the bibles and don\u2019t send us anymore otherwise we\u2019ll stop talking to you entirely.\u201d\n\nThen my partner and I used the $110 on weed lol.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678563613.0},{"title":"Three Texas women are sued for wrongful death after allegedly helping friend obtain abortion medication","author":"TurnipTaint","url":"https:\/\/www.texastribune.org\/2023\/03\/10\/texas-abortion-lawsuit\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678489753.0},{"title":"Burning the Quran isn't extreme, but you know what is.","author":"Mission_Mark4869","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11ny3k8\/burning_the_quran_isnt_extreme_but_you_know_what\/","text":"Physical assaulting people for burning the Quran.\n\nRamming and flipping over people's cars, almost killing them, for burning the Quran.\n\nSetting cars on fire because people burned the Quran.\n\nThrowing rocks at people who burn the Quran.\n\nCommitting criminal and immoral acts in general and acting like a bunch of crazed lunatics because someone burned a book is extreme.\n\nThese are just a few reactions I've seen to people burning the Quran.

We are \"meant\" to live once and make the most out of it. Anyway. The problem I get from my theist friends is that how could life mean anything if it ends. My very simple answear is \"How could life mean anything if it does not end\". A very basic econimic rule is that the value of everything is tied to its rarity. The old diamonds and water dilema. Why is water so cheap when it helps you survive and diamonds so expensive if they are not mandatory for your wellbeing? The answear is rarity\n\nNothing eternal is valuable. Life loses its meaning when its eternal. You are meant to live in hell or heaven for the rest of eternity and this just sounds miserable. Your life aint special either way. Having and infinite amount of time to \"be\" waters down your being. However, having a limited amout of time to exists, to make mistakes and live with them , gives people purpose. In eternity there will be no change (think of the heatdeath) and where is bo chage there is no life, no autonomy. Being immortal in heaven and hell would destroy your person.\n\nIt is a good thing we are mortals. It is a good thing we have a limited amount of time on this earth. Its not scary. Its realivieng. Heaven is a stagnant bliss with no conflict and no real autonomy. Hell is the place where you go to suffer for eternity but the suffering can become as numb as anything else so again, no autonomy, just a conflictless state of being.

The most honest goal of researching history is to find the best explanation of available evidence chosen from the most probable explanations. The problem with Christian apologists is that they simultaneously hold two conflicting judgments about the probability of resurrection.\n\nOn the one hand, apologists believe that resurrection is rare and extraordinary enough such that Christ's resurrection proves his divinity, and that resurrection claims outside the Christian tradition ought to be dismissed. Yet on the other hand, resurrection must also be probable enough such that it is the best explanation of the Easter narratives, which happen to be very contradictory and incomplete. Furthermore, the fine-tuning argument as proof for God presumes that the laws of nature are consistent, making resurrections improbable.\n\nWhat evidence do we have? The only clear report of a public encounter with the risen Jesus is that of 1 Corinth. 15:6, which mentions 500 brethren who saw him together. To satisfy the criterion of early attestation, apologists insist that Paul recorded this from an earlier source, but doing so concedes that this sighting occurred before Paul's conversion, implying that Paul was not there firsthand. Moreover, there is no mention of the location of this sighting nor the names of any of the brethren. Did these brethren know what Jesus looked like before the sighting? There is a chance that even Paul himself had no way of tracking down these brethren to confirm these claims, since there is no mention of the names of any of the brethren, nor where they lived.\n\nThe gospel accounts fare no better. Reliable manuscripts of Mark, which is the oldest of the four, end abruptly at Mark 16:8; based on Mark alone, it could not be said that the risen Jesus is even encountered at all. The other three describe encounters with Jesus in private settings with mostly close acquaintances. Was the tomb door open or closed when Mary Magdalene arrived? was there a man or a pair of angels present when Mary Magdalene arrived? did Jesus first encounter the disciples in Galilee, Jerusalem, or Emmaus? what did Jesus say and do after the resurrection? To these questions each of the gospels gives a unique set of answers.\n\nNot only are the Easter narratives contradictory, they diverge more severely than the narratives about the last supper, the betrayal, the passion, and the crucifixion. The first encounter with the risen Jesus arguably deserves far more attention than, say, that of an ear sliced off from one of the men who arrested Jesus. And yet, the slicing of the ear is recorded with far more consistency in all four gospels than the first encounter with the risen Jesus.\n\nIt is also said that the disciples would not had risked their lives to spread false reports of his resurrection if they did not truly believe what they preached. But a belief that Jesus was resurrected is not the same as a belief that one personally encountered Jesus after resurrection. If enough people were confidently proclaiming that Jesus rose from the dead, then more followers who were formerly devoted to Jesus could very well had come to believe it as well. It might very well be the case that the disciples believed Jesus rose from the dead without believing that they personally encountered the risen Jesus themselves, and that the claims of the risen Jesus visiting all the disciples were legends and embellishments that developed later. As social media has taught us, misinformation often spreads faster and is believed by more people than the truth. And martyrdom does not prove truth, as many other religious and political movements throughout the ages have taught us.\n\nThe New Testament has over 5000 ancient manuscripts while other ancient works are lucky to have merely ten. It is therefore often said that the events of the NT could be asserted with more confidence than any other event of ancient history. But a large number of manuscripts only makes it easier to reconstruct what the authors originally wrote. It does not imply that the authors wrote reliable history in the first place. Ancient scribes devoting more papyri and ink to copying a text does not change the thoughts of the original authors.\n\nApologists regularly appeal to the criterion of embarrassment, asserting that the absence of legendary embellishment in the narratives of favorable claims increases the likelihood of their truth. But they ignore embellishment when it endangers other favorable claims. The claim that Jesus' tomb was guarded by soldiers is one such claim, which is recorded only in Matthew and indeed seems legendary. An angel arrives and shakes the ground so forcefully as to paralyze the soldiers with fear before throwing open the door to the empty tomb.\n\nWithout guards, some political enemy of the Pharisees who wanted to undermine their power may very well had bribed someone to steal the body from the tomb and to confidently proclaim the resurrection of Jesus to rekindle the zeal of the fading Christian movement. Perhaps the young man at the tomb described in Mark was that bandit. I do not have a shred of evidence for this alternative explanation; but as was stated at the beginning, a claim cannot be both extraordinary and yet probable enough to be the best explanation of contradictory evidence, especially when the laws of nature are consistent, as is presumed in the fine-tuning argument. Therefore, an actual resurrection could not be a better explanation than the one herein proposed.\n\nThe claim of Jesus' resurrection does have real-life consequences. Christians are often taught to die for this claim, or to prioritize this claim above good works. Dogmatic adherence to this claim often results in prejudice towards those who reject it, despite it being perfectly reasonable and harmless to doubt. It can lead to aggressive methods of proselytism, such as that of John Chau who tried to evangelize the Sentinelese in 2018 at the risk of wiping them out with disease. Belief in this claim is protected under 1st amendment rights, but it can only be taken on faith, and not forced upon other people as unquestionable history.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678526084.0},{"title":"Where does our sense of Morality and Ethics originate if not from a Higher Being.","author":"TravelingMerchant199","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11p6ezp\/where_does_our_sense_of_morality_and_ethics\/","text":"Hi, I'm new to Atheism, and I get constantly get asked this by religious people. \n\nI'm keen to hear some of your insights into this.\n\nI've seen studies that show an underlying proclivity towards ethical behaviour in animals and humans.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, could have prepared me for his last message. **This is what it said:**\n\n>when you take a moment and think about it science can't even prove how the universe was created. let's dissect the evolution claim. evolution claims that 2 atoms came together to form the universe. that would mean that the universe created itself. meaning it had an awareness. and actually the big bang theory is taught in schools. i'm pretty sure you've heard of it. you are the one who is illiterate. science is a physical man made construct. it was our way of understanding the world we live in. and if you stop trying to downplay religion and combine science with religion you will have the answer. first: the big bang theory actually does suggest that let me quote the exact theory(A COLLISION between TWO BRANES could have jolted the universe from contraction to expansion). making that single point(their collision) the start of the universe. which makes my statement somewhat true.\n\n>second if jesus isn't proven to be real the why is there an entire era of his time (2023 A.D) A.D meaning after death which refers to the death of Christ. (Jesus Christ). well it wouldn't make sense to refer to the death of someone who doesn't exist now does it? you like to think that you're smart right? maybe you might think that doesn't make sense either. now i have to ask you this, if a person were to make a claim that there was a spaceship with an alien inside of it. and later on they find the spaceship, and it's clearly not from earth. doesn't that kinda prove that the persons claim was true?\n>second: if big bang theory was just a theory then why is it taught in EVERY school in the united states?\n>third: all religious beliefs are based upon faith. that's how religion works actually Imfaoo.you have to believe it's real before you can understand it.seems i'm not the one who's\n\"scientifically illiterate\".\n>fourth: you didn't think about your argument very well. your entire point is that \"there's no scientific proof that god or a divine being exists so it can't exist\". there's no proof that the center of the earth is made of magma so that can't be true right? exactly, that stupid ass argument doesn't make any sense.\n\n>fifth: proof of gods existence is in us. the world is to perfectly designed for it to be a coincidence that it was created. the planet is at the perfect distance from the sun to sustain life. that Can't be a coincidence. plus if that's the case then why can't we prove that's what happened? science ALONE isn't the \"best method\" for determining the truth. if it was then why is religion still even relevant?\n\nThis message honestly broke me. I didn't think people like this could actually be real. I didn't even know how to even start explaining how fundamentally wrong his understanding of EVERYTHING was. I didn't think it was possible for someone to have such a fundamental lack of understanding in all areas of science.

As a child, luckily, I was given no religious instruction. And so when I figured out I\u2019m gay, I wondered why I am an abomination. Being an avid reader this lead me to reading the bible. \n\nAfter four years I got through that tome, it was a long hard slog. One of the worst written, poorly edited pieces of fiction I have ever read. But I\u2019m very glad I did it.\n\nSince, according to Pew Research 90% of all \u201cchristians\u201d have never read the bible, I win every debate I enter about the bible. I will enumerate some of my favorite bits of biblical lore I use to horrify the true believers.\n\n1.  There are two conflicting creation stories in Genesis.\n\n2. In Genesis 6:2 it is stated god has \u201csons\u201d, meaning Jesus was not god\u2019s \u201conly begotten son\u201d (1 John 4:9).\n\n3. In the flood of Noah, god drowned all humans except Noah and a small handful of his relatives, included in the drowned was any number of infants, one and two year olds, and pregnant women.\n\n4. In Exodus 4:21 god \u201chardens Pharoah\u2019s heart\u201d so Pharoah will not let the Jews leave Egypt, this is so god can bring plagues onto Egypt including the slaughter of all the first born, god\u2019s second mass murder, (this includes the first-born cattle, Exodus 12:29)\n\n5. A concubine is a sex slave. Exodus 21:7-10 gives detailed instructions on selling your daughter as a sex slave. \n\n6. There are two sets of \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d Exodus 20:3-17 and Exodus 34:14-28, these two differ greatly.\n\n7. Leviticus 15:16-18 tells you what to do if a man\u2019s \u201cseed of copulation go out from him\u201d. You never know when this will come in handy. Pun intended!\n\n8. Leviticus 20:6 warns you not to go \u201ca whoring\u201d after wizards. Does this include Harry Potter?\n\n9. Leviticus 19:20 states if a man rapes an engaged female slave, she shall be beaten.\n\n10. Leviticus 25:44-46 give instructions on who you can own as a slave, and how to obtain said slave.\n\n11. Leviticus 27:1-7 god puts monetary value on human life, fetuses and infants under one month old are worthless.\n\n12. Leviticus 27:32 god claims 1\/10 of your gross income.\n\nWasn\u2019t that fun, and I barely scratched the surface of the first three books of the old testament, there are literally thousands of morally disgusting tidbits in the \u201cHoly Book\u201d, and the new testament isn\u2019t any better.\n\nIf you can, I suggest every atheist read the bible, I would suggest reading a modern translation as opposed to the King James Version, the KJV was written about the time of Shakespeare and we know how easy his plays are to read.\n\nToday there are numerous internet sites to help a person understand this foul book, one of my favorites is \u201cThe Skeptics Annotated Bible\u201d.

So freakin mad. Today was the talk about evolution in our biology class and the amount of people who support creationism (seemingly almost everyone) is what I find disgusting. So it started out with the question given to the class on what they knew about evolution. \n\nI was the first to answer stating that we didn\u2019t come from monkeys rather, they are our cousins (thank you forest valaki\ud83e\udee1) The teacher then talked for some time about this affirming that this is a common misconception but then what happened next made me so mad. \n\nShe asked the class what the Bible said and what the Bible thinks. Obviously my class had the answers because of the majority of the religious individuals and we then went down that rabbit hole. \n\nWe started to talk about what religions believe and she even showed a religious diagram of how they claim evolution has happened with  the flood and she mentioned how the graph showed the rapture at its end. We talked about the fucking rapture at a public government run school!!!\n\nThat isn\u2019t even what I feel is the worst part. Throughout the talk she made sure to speak about science as only theories( which technically yes they are) and when mentioning the Bible just stated that the Bible said so. What also killed me is when she was trying to make the case that science isn\u2019t fully reliable and that it has be wrong in the past and she gave the example about how science said the earth was flat and it was wrong. This is a lie, science never claimed the earth was flat. She needs to read a fucking history book because I know full well how the church reacted when it was presented with the idea of a heliocentric model.\n\nScience doesn\u2019t claim to be all knowing like religion, rather it works to find the truth. She emphasized the need for faith in the belief for both religion and science but she didn\u2019t mention how we have actual evidence for evolution and not a dusty old slavery promoting book for religion. \n\nThere is a common angry atheist stereotype that I am now starting to see why it exists. It is because when you are constantly bombarded every day by Jesus loves you and thank god statements you get hella pissed. Not to mention a teacher making the case that religion and science are just conflicting views and making it seem like a happy disagreement. Looking forward to college and I hope to immerse my self in the most secular activities possible and end my lineage\u2019s belief in this shitty thing called religion. \n\n\n\nEdit: I have reported this on ffrf and on the anonymous bully reporting app stop it that our school uses. \nIn both I have included the words below detailing the exact actions that where taken ( she said and did a lot more but that would just be my own word and it would probably be possible for the school to find the creationist diagram she used in her google drive, I didn\u2019t want to make any unverified claims and decrease my credibility or get in trouble for what they might think is lying)\nHere they are:\n\nBiology teacher was doing a lesson on evolution and framed it as a controversial topic between religion and science saying how you must understand both sides. Everything I say below is what I honestly remember with no hyperboles or exaggerations.\nShe said or did the following things:\n1. A creationist evolution diagram was shown. (That is the exact diagram in the image below)\n2. When reviewing the creationist diagram and looking at the lower blue line, she mentioned Noah\u2019s ark and the great flood saying that is what religious people believe happened\n3. When reviewing the creationist diagram she explained how the top grey line indicates the rapture or the second coming of christ.\n4. Stated how it is important to understand both religious and scientific views in order to better under the controversy\n\nThe diagram she used can be found on the awnsers in genesis website right below.

So i spammed them with pro choice literature, as well as peta, mormons, islam, hinduism, nambla, church of satan, andrew tate, climate change deniers, climate change information, flat earthers, scientology, local bdsm stores, various vegan blogs, various porn sites, etc.  Fuck these people and fuck their outreach program. I hope they are forced to change their email and approach. I laughed like a madman with every sign up i did. The more outlandish or annoying i thought the sign up was, the harder i laughed.

You need to believe and know your god is Real and wants the most of \/ all your adoration:\nCommandment 1 \u201cYou shall have no other gods before me\".\nCommandment 2\u00a0\u201cYou shall not make for yourself a carved image,...You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the\u00a0Lord\u00a0your God am\u00a0a jealous God,\u00a0...\" Exodus 20 ESV\nNo others before me? Meaning, you can, as long as it's not in God's face? Also, an idol by definition is a connecting object to the transcendent\/spiritual, although the graven image is a material image or representation of god to be used in worship. Therefore, a stained glass or iconostasis of Mary Theotokos is more an idol than BAAL, or pagan gods. Furthermore, the golden calf was an idol. Desert Israelites didn't forget YHWH, but appropriated His worship to the bull, not Moses. Aaron said here is the God that took you out of Egypt. The Bible is full of condemnations of idolatry in gentiles, but then concedes and says in 1 Corinthians 8 that there is only 1 God, so it's okay to eat food sacrificed to idols (which Psalms 115:5-8 says that they are just non-living materials: ears they have, but do not hear) . Tell that to Daniel 1, right? What about Paul's warning against idolatry, or witchcraft (which is pharmakeia in Greek)?\nMy question is this, why is it non-religious people that get accused by believers of the supernatural for having our own religion: atheism, being a football fanatic, or even committing a sin when we watch more TV than reading the Bible and\/or the confessional prophet (Joseph Smith, Mohamed, EGW, etc). To have an idol means to actually believe in it, so what's different between believing in your god vs your neighbour's (which you gotta love as yourself) god?

And also, if you're reading this as a Christian visiting this subreddit, just don't bother trying to convert me in DMs or in the comments, I promise you I've heard everything and you will just waste your time.\n\nI don't consider myself fully atheist, because I don't see it being completely impossible that one or multiple gods exist, I just have a hard time believing in the existence Abrahamic God of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, as well as in Jesus. I also wanna point out that I don't look down on religious people since I'm not the type of person who looks down on anyone, and because some of the nicest people I know are practicing Christians. But I am sick and tired of the same old phraces that they say about God. \n\nAccording to Christians, God loves every single one of us, and he has \"plans\" for how our lives are supposed to turn out. Yet he still let's every single bad thing happen to someone, including the most terrible and traumatic experiences, and you're supposed to believe that these are \"tests\" or whatever? Yet when someone is clearly struggling, god keeps letting bad things happen to them, but apparently it's a huge sin if one commits suicide, and will lead to eternal suffering in the underworld... Can you really call God loving then, because it sure as hell doesn't seem to me that God is loving at all, like why does he let terrible events and natural disasters happen to people if he loves all of us? And why did he let the world wars, the holocaust, and every other genocide happen if he truly loves us all? You wanna know what that makes me think Christian? It makes me think that what you claim God is is utter bullshit. To me, God seems like an uncaring being who simply watches over his creation.\n\nPersonally, I think it's much more likely that \"God\" in reality is some kind of eldritch lovecraftian being, and that existence is all but a dream inside it's mind, and that it will inevitably wake up.\n\nI didn't write this post to seek sympathy, but to give a little bit of insight about me: I'm depressed, anxious and at times suicidal. I've had a life dominated by loneliness, and things only got worse after my parents' divorce. It's one of the reasons I've never been religious, because the world has always seemed cold and uncaring to me.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678327580.0},{"title":"Christianity destroys the environment","author":"6_child_Da_Vinci","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/O10KvgIggus","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678325543.0},{"title":"Atheists of Reddit, do you find humor or take offense to Christian movie\u2019s depiction of \u201cAtheists\u201d?","author":"UnfallenAdventure","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11mhwvy\/atheists_of_reddit_do_you_find_humor_or_take\/","text":"If you\u2019ve ever seen most any Christian movie you\u2019ll find the antagonist to be an atheist. \n\nWhich is terrible, absolutely.

However, this could be a biased observation considering I have only researched about cults in a specific country where a majority of the population does not practice the religions.\n\n And one day, I was grabbed a random old lady who was trying to convince to attend the church. When I told her that I don't believe in any sort of god, she told me that atheists like you become the most ardent believers in the church, saying she was an atheist as well before she become christian (but she didn't seem okay).\n\n Not everybody are immune to falling into cults since it can be exist in many forms, like hustler university, but I wanted like to know what others think about this question. I wish I have done more research but it's hard to find some paper or articles on the correlation between prior religious beliefs and cult susceptibility.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678197812.0},{"title":"Tech coach Adams' comment 'racially insensitive'","author":"TheLe99","url":"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/35791167\/texas-tech-coach-suspended-racially-insensitive-comment","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678230770.0},{"title":"They always use this argument!

IMMEDIATELY the mood changed and my Ma got a completely disgusted and angry look on her face and said\n\n\"Well now I'm not watching it. Hollywood always has to stick their gay agenda into everything.\" \n\nI'm always having to listen to their vile rhetoric on gay and trans people and I'm just tired of it and looked at her and said \n\n\"Why don't you just say that you hate gay people?\"\n\nAnd she was thrown back and said\n\"I don't hate gay people, Hollywood just has to throw it in our faces and shove it down our throats! It's everywhere!\"\n\nAnd I replied, \"So are heterosexual relationships but you don't complain about that.\"\n\nAnd my dad chimed in saying\n\"That's because it's natural.\"\n\nThere was a long debate back and forth where I explained to them again that homosexuality is natural and has been shown to be natural, and they kept going on about how gay people are so privileged and that Christians are the real persecuted people in the US and that gay people are soon going to be having Christians tried in court for being Christians then start decapitating them and yadda yadda yadda more persecution fetish and how gay people need to just shut up and stop being in media and such. And I ended it with telling them that they are the perfect examples of the American Christian because they aren't loving, they sit in front of Fox News all day and complain about how gay and trans people are the fall of society and how they shouldn't have rights but it's okay because it's \"not hate\" they do it out of \"love\".

It's dehumanizing and having to spend the one life I have having to fight for my right to exist because you have people like pastor Steve Anderson and Dillon Awes calling for the execution of gay people and the absolute diseased ideas they spread to others who then take out their problems on people they have been told to hate, it's exhausting. I'm exhausted. \n\nIf you're the type of person who talks like they do, just say it. You hate gay people. You do. Just be honest. I'm tired of pretending it's something that it's not because you don't have the balls to say what it really is. I'm tired of defending my family. I love them, but they hate people like me. Which is sad because they are otherwise good people. But it's like Hitchens pointed out, religion makes normally moral people do and say wicked and disgusting things.\n\nI'm just frustrated and wanted to get this off my chest because I'm just honestly so tired of it. And I want to say, if your family is the same, you don't need to defend them. I'm learning it's okay to love your family but also recognize when their ideas are absolutely vile and honestly probably recognize that they may not be good people. I can't wait for the day when all these horrible ideas are dead and in the past. \n\nIf you read my whole rant, thanks! I wanted to put more but didn't want to bore everyone. \n\nTL;DR My parents hate gay people, I told them to just say it and stop pretending that they don't.

And that is true to some extent, but there are some things that are hidden to the general public even among Sikhs, and I think it would be interesting to unravel them and have a discussion about it.\n\nSo let's start with Guru Tegh Bahadur, the 9th Sikh guru, and the second last human guru of Sikhism overall. He was described as an itinerary guru who travelled across the Indian subcontinent , preaching and also involving himself in the political affairs of the country such as mediating and interceding in disputes. He eventually bought a site near the Himalayan range and had a city built on it called **Anandpur Sahib**. During his time, there was the reign of a Mughal ruler, Aurangzeb, who is widely considered to be one of the most oppressive and intolerant rulers in Indian history, and was vigilant in wanting to implement orthodox Islamic rule throughout the subcontinent, and he was ruthlessly efficient in quelling rebellions and expanding his empire. Hindu and Sikh sources make it very, very clear that Muslim oppression was rampant during this period. Sikh tradition has it that a congregation of Kashmiri Hindus approached Guru Tegh Bahadur on account of their oppression and forced conversions in Kashmir, the Guru is said to have responded by saying that such activities can only be mitigated by the sacrifice of a holy man, his son Gobind Das, was said to have overheard and responded by saying \"Who could be a greater sacrifice than you to defend the poor Brahmins\". And so Guru Tegh Bahdur left for the capital Delhi to protest against the injustice and was detained by the Mughals and later executed for refusing to convert to Islam. Mughal\/Persian sources state that the Guru was actually executed for plundering and coercing donations from the people of Punjab along with a Muslim associate. Both sides ofc have reasons to make their side look good so there's definitely embellishment on both sides and we don't know the exact story.\n\nGuru Gobind Das (or Guru Gobind Rai, later Gobind Singh) was shortly thereafter made the next Sikh guru. Sikh tradition has it that Guru Gobind Das ruled in Anandpur Sahib, had 52 court poets which would translate various Hindu scriptures and the original compositions of Guru Gobind. He would have many conflicts with the Hindu hilly kings near Anandpur, causing him to temporarily relocate and was determined in overthrowing the Mughal rule at the time. He would later create the Khalsa (baptized community of Sikhs), mandating to them the belief in one God alone, and made the Sikhs a military order that would transcend caste proscriptions and injunctions which is why Sikhs use the name Singh and Kaur to hide any caste indicators in their name, and was determined in defeating the Turks (archaic way of saying Muslim in that time). Eventually the Hindu hill kings and the Mughals created an alliance to remove Guru Gobind Singh from Anandpur, they sieged the city, and when the Guru's fort eventually ran out of supplies due to being encircled, Guru Gobind Singh agreed to leave Anandpur and asked for safe passage. The Mughals and Hindu hill kings agreed and even swore upon the Quran and the holy cow respectively. Both of them broke their promises and pursued Guru Gobind while he was leaving, in the confusion 2 of Gobind's children were killed in battle and the other 2 captured, taken to Sirhind and executed after they refused to convert to Islam. Guru Gobind Singh later met a Hindu monk in Nanded, Maharashtra called Madho Das, later Banda Singh Bahadur, and made him his military successor before the Guru was assassinated.\n\n**So obviously the siege of Anandpur is a watershed moment in Sikh history, it led to the death of all 4 of Guru Gobind's children and led to the downfall of Guru Gobind himself, but what is left out in modern discourse is the casus belli of the siege which is that the Sikhs were actually the transgressors and were constantly looting and harassing the villagers in the hill kings' territories. The number of Sikhs in Anandpur Sahib began to proliferate rapidly during the early 1700s and because of that the Sikhs were compelled to loot from other villages. Eventually this got out of hand and the hill kings decided that Guru Gobind had to be kicked out and petitioned the Mughals in the upcoming siege. And this is Sikh sources in the 1700s and 1800s that mention this. There is a text called Gursobha which was written in 1711 by one of Guru Gobind Singh's court poets, it says in Chapter 11**\n\n>That was how the Khalsa conducted itself, Daily would its warriors invade the villages. Whosoever came out of a village to receive them, Some offerings in kind would he offer to the Khalsa.||5||408|| If some one showed reluctance in making an offering, Instantly, would the Khalsa plunder his belongings. As Khalsa\u2019s rising power became a talk of the town, The hill chiefs started confabulating among themselves\n\nIn another primary source, Ratan Singh Bhangu who is one of the most prolific and influential Sikh historians wrote in his Gur Panth Prakash\n\n>The Khalsa force, thus, adopted such a strategy, Which they kept on practising for a considerable time. When the numerical strength of the Panth (Sikh nation) increased manifold, They decided to impose a mandatory tax on the people. As the Khalsa Panth kept on increasing day by day, They started feeling the scarcity of provisions and clothing. So they passed a resolution to the effect: That they must impose a compulsory contribution on each village. When people refused to make the compulsory contribution, The Singhs used violent and coercive methods to get provisions. The affected people went to approach the Mughal rulers, And petitioned against the Singhs for their violence and coercion\n\nAnd this narrative is also confirmed by very reputable researchers such as Louis Fenech in his Oxford University book The Sikh Zafar-namah of Guru Gobind Singh, Anshu Malhotra, Farina Mir in their Oxford University book Punjab Reconsidered: History, Culture, and Practice and even Jagtar Singh Grewal in his Cambridge University book The Sikhs of the Punjab.

The Sikhs came and went and the Guru's darbar daily increased in pros- perity and splendour. Two years and some days passed in this manner when again the old sore reappeared. The Khalsa horse- men again began to fall upon villagers and levy contributions by force. Those who paid forthwith were not troubled further but those who delayed or refused were looted. The plain truth was thus brought home to the Hill chiefs that they could have no peace and security until the Guru was expelled from Anandpur. Evidently the villages around Anandpur had been ceded to the Guru by the Raja of Kahlur as a part of the agreement already referred to, and this, as we have seen, had ensured peace for two years. The Guru and the Hill Rajas apparently lived on friendly terms and the Mughals had no reason to interfere. But with the gradual increase of the Guru's power and the number of his followers, he oould not go on without a further expansion of territory and the old troubles reappeared. Fresh hostilities be- oame inevitable and the Hill chiefs arranged a formidable com- bination against the Guru. An ultimatum was sent to the effect that the Guru must forthwith evacuate the fort of Anandgarh\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur who avenged Guru Gobind Singh and his sons' deaths by killing Wazir Khan (the man responsible) and is today respected and celebrated by many Sikhs was actually kicked out of the Sikh religion by Guru Gobind Singh's wife. Many sources say that he went against the Guru's commands like changing the Sikh dress, the Sikh slogan, demanded that the Sikhs be vegetarian only, and even that he was harsh towards the Muslim commoners during his quest to conquer Punjab and even practiced caste rituals that the Sikhs were ordered to disregard completely. We know for a fact that him and Mata Sundri were at odds with each other, and Banda even wrote letters to Mata Sundri calling her a dumb woman. Because the Sikhs who allied with Mata Sundri abandoned Banda, the Mughals were able to capture him and it led to his grisly execution.\n\nSo yeah, I just thought this was interesting, and it shows that even in \"good religions\" like Sikhism and Buddhism, there's some issues and ugly history in it.

Although he was an atheist, he didn\u2019t object to singing Christian music \u2014 years in children\u2019s choruses and \u201choliday\u201d concerts had accustomed him to that.\n\nBut as I, high on maternal pride, was calculating how I\u2019d get him to two rehearsals a week, he asked me whether the church condoned same-sex marriage. I said I didn\u2019t know. He said, well, if they didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t join.\n\nI checked: They most emphatically did not. When I told the choirmaster why my son was declining the invitation, he responded that progressive forces inside the church were working toward change. I wished him well. Even if their efforts succeeded, the change would no doubt arrive after my son\u2019s tenure as an angel-voiced advertisement for a discriminatory institution.\n\nAre you impressed by the moral clarity I expressed \u2026 after having been schooled by a seventh-grader?\n\nI thought of this moment when I read that last month, Pensacola Christian College in Florida had disinvited the King\u2019s Singers \u2014 an a cappella group visiting campus \u2014 two hours before their scheduled performance. The college canceled, it later said, \u201cupon learning that one of the artists openly maintained a lifestyle that contradicts Scripture.\u201d In other words, because one of its members was gay.\n\nIn fact, two are. The King\u2019s Singers knew about the college\u2019s position on homosexuality when they agreed to play there, but as they explained in an Instagram post: \u201cOur belief is that music can build a common language that allows people with different views and perspectives to come together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely gracious statement. Yet I have to ask them, as I belatedly asked myself years ago: Why so tolerant of bigotry?\n\nAre we just so accustomed to the anti-LGBTQ stances of conservative religious institutions that they don\u2019t even register? Are we so used to church-sponsored homophobia that we ignore the vast, forbidding landscape of prejudice while celebrating the tiniest signs of change?\n\nIt made the news, for example, when Pope Francis told the Associated Press recently that homosexuality should not be criminalized, as it is in 67 countries, and urged bishops around the world to recognize everyone\u2019s dignity. Amen.\n\nHe noted, however, that homosexuality is still a sin. The Catholic Church will keep calling it a sin, and urging sinners to repent, and it will keep refusing to recognize same-sex marriage or to condone adoption by same-sex parents, but in a way that also totally recognizes their dignity!\n\n(Not for nothing: Where does the pope think those countries first got the idea that homosexuality should be a crime?)\n\nIn January, the Church of England apologized for its treatment of LGBTQ people while clarifying that such people would not be allowed to marry in the church. \u201cFor the times we have rejected or excluded you, and those you love, we are deeply sorry,\u201d the pastoral letter reads. And for the times we will continue to reject or exclude you, we are so deeply sorry for those, too!\n\nThese official church statements represent genteel, soft-spoken prejudice in God\u2019s name. For a more brutal version, take a look (if you can stomach it) at Hemant Mehta\u2019s recent roundup of \u201cChristian hate preachers,\u201d each opining on video that gay people should be executed. It\u2019s horrifying.\n\nOf course, many progressive churches \u2014 and synagogues and mosques \u2014 welcome their LGBTQ siblings as full and equal members. And many that don\u2019t yet will get there eventually.\n\nThe Episcopal Church, for example, now officially sanctions same-sex marriage. And the Albany diocese \u2014 well, it\u2019s working on it. A statement on the Episcopal Church website notes: \u201cAs with all spiritual journeys, everyone walks at their own pace. Some Episcopal congregations are actively involved in LGBTQ ministry and their arms are open wide; others are more reserved, but their doors are still open to all; some are still wrestling with their beliefs and feelings.\u201d\n\nFair enough, right?\n\nNow, let\u2019s pretend that instead of talking about LGBTQ people, the church was talking about congregations \u201cwrestling with their beliefs and feelings\u201d about Black people.

Raised in a \u201cmoderate\u201d loving household (very liberal for Christian standards) but still was baptized, went to church as a kid and teen in the youth groups. The only reason I think I was able to find my way out is because I stayed in public schools and was allowed to do secular activities so I wasn\u2019t always surrounded by religion to brainwash me to the point of no return. I started questioning my beliefs around the end of high school. When I went to college from age 18-22, that was my big journey into atheism and now realize that I am totally not a Christian and have no problem criticizing religion and defending my views on it.\n\nDuring my transition, I have realized the issues it had caused me as a teen, unable to think critically because of my parents making me go to church and being forced to be subjected to the Bible instead of being able to just naturally let my views develop. In the Christian mindset this makes sense, you want your kids to \u201cturn out good\u201d, but in the atheist mindset I feel pissed because I was denied the free thinking about what healthy sexuality is, what critical thinking is, that I am worthy enough, and I am good enough. It caused me a lot of conflict working through the fact that I felt dirty for natural sexual desires and that it would be sinful for me to have sex before marriage. My parents instead of giving me secular sex education they gave me ZERO sex education and forced me to learn from church and the internet. \n\nOvertime as I strengthened my atheism I begin to see new ways it has robbed me of previous time I\u2019ll never get back. My parents know I\u2019m annoyed with religion and try to tell me about how \u201cit\u2019s not all bad\u201d and it just makes me mad knowing how ignorant they are about the issues they enabled me to experience. So I\u2019m kind of a closeted atheist at home until I move out.\n\nBut when they see I have a girlfriend and we begin to take vacations, or move in together they\u2019ll know right away that we\u2019re having premarital sex and my Mom thinks it\u2019s wrong yet has never been able to say why and just says \u201cit\u2019s just what I feel\u201d (when knowing my sister moved in before marriage with her BF) and I suspect they\u2019ll give me those little criticisms and I\u2019m gonna have trouble not exploding at them. They probably think they did nothing wrong raising me the way they did, and then will be disappointed that I no longer share their views on religion and sex. You can\u2019t raise a kid and expect them to mirror your beliefs, you\u2019re supposed to enable them to think for theirselves and become a independent adult, and I had to do the last parts of that by myself while I undid all the crap religion did to me.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna bring it up because telling someone who\u2019s been religious their whole life that I think it\u2019s wrong to raise me in it isn\u2019t gonna be a very productive conversation. But the longer I live the more I realize the things I have been robbed of and had to undo, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever be able to understand without either breaking their hearts or hurting our relationship, but I think the topics gonna eventually come up someday as they get more hints that I am atheist overtime (not practicing abstinence, never going to church, dating a fellow atheist, not baptizing my kids someday, etc.)","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678132572.0},{"title":"Mayor Adam\u2019s Recent Comments - Alarming?

About 2 months ago my parents found out i was in a secret relationship with a non-muslim guy. They found out through me sneaking him in which is dumb i know but still. They freaked out and went through my phone. When they went through my phone they found out that I had drank before and my friends actively drink and hang out with the opposite gender (just as friends). They lost their minds and eventually downloaded my data from snap chat and went through message records and found out i wasnt a virgin. Since then they have made me take a pregnancy test, sold my car, my dad made my mom quit her job and blames her for everything, he hit my mom in front of me, they have me on full lock down,not let me hang out with my friends, deleted my social media accounts, and constantly emotionally black mail me. Telling me how I've ruined their life and broken their trust and completely betrayed them, how I played with their religion and crossed Allah's boundaries. They repeat back things he texted me and things we talked about, mocking me for it. They tell me how I also ruined the family name and have the devil in me. Now all of this I can deal with the emotional and verbal abuse. But I'm a senior in highschool and now they are refusing to let me go to my state college and want to sell our house and move to another state. They want to leave our state completely and leave everything behind to \u201csave my religion\u201d. They want to force me to take a gap year and attend an institute to strengthen my deen and then want to move me to another state so I can get away from \u201cbad friends and influences\u201d. They have already put the house on sale. I am so mentally and physically weak, I have panic attacks all the time, I have lost so much weight and I can't eat half of the time. I don't want to move. I love my home and my friends, I had plans to go to school here and be with my boyfriend. My boyfriend is now going out of state since I will no longer be attending our local college. I'm so distraught, I don't wanna lose him. I love him so much and he's willing to do long distance with me but I'm not even sure how that will work out since he will be in Maryland and god knows where I will be. I'm so thankful for him. He's been my rock this whole time. I wouldn't be able to do anything without him. Please help me or give me some advice. I've thought about moving out but my parents would fully disown me and they would be ridiculed in society and i'm an only child so everything kind of rides on me. I'm so sad. I wish this never happened. I was so close to freedom I was so close to having my own life away from my family. I was so close to living out college with my boyfriend and now everything seems so hopeless. I never expected my parents to be so extreme. I'm so alone, I'd rather die than end my relationship with my boyfriend but I won't even get to have the last few months of highschool with him because of them. I'm gonna be so alone without anyone and I'm gonna miss him so much and he's gonna find someone else and I'll be so alone. I wish I didn't mess up so badly. My parents aren't evil.

Mostly, it's due to personal reasons. Now, I definitely don't live and die military. Or white and blue, for that matter. \n\nIf you are not aware of it, the military tries to accept and protect all religions or lack thereof, but it is inherently Christian. Most chaplains you meet are Christians or were raised Christians. A lot of upper leadership, you guessed it, are Christians, because they're old and that's how they grew up. \n\nThis isn't inherently an issue, but it can be, especially if left uncontrolled.\n\nNow, this post isn't just about the military aspect of it. In fact, I am making this post to hopefully help you build some courage to stand up for others, even at the cost of your own comfort. Keep it in mind, however, that there are many layers to this post, so I understand you may disagree with some of my points.\n\nNow, to the story:\n\nMy immediate shop \"leader\" is a Christian, with a big C. He loves and dies Jesus, and goes to Church every Sunday. To no one's surprise, he is also extremely conservative. Loves guns, loves big T, big DeS, loves his submissive wife, loves low corporate taxes, loves poor people, loves the uneducated, loves people without melanin on their skin, hates homeless veterans, the whole thing. \n\nIn the past, he has gotten in trouble for saying the big no-nos out loud: Being openly racist, homophobic, antisemitic, etc.. He shut his mouth for a little while, but like any other true Christian, he felt like he can't be silenced and his true colors just NEED to show. He's now back to saying anything that's on his mind, as long as he feels like he's with his safe group. Sometimes he lets it slip, though.\n\nBeing in the Military, we are obviously known to curse a lot. We curse, we say stupid shit, we talk about controversial topics, etc.. It's all obviously unprofessional, but they can't fire us, so who cares, right? On the flip side, since they can't fire you, some people think they can just openly be the same shitty fucking person they are at home, at work.\n\nIf that happens, there are one of two things we usually do when this comes from those above us. 1) Shut up and pretend to be on their side so we don't get fucked over or 2) Report the actions to the inspector general (not to management, because they'll likely just slap them on the wrist and tell them to not do it again). The problem is, the IG isn't as helpful as you'd think, because mission takes precedence a lot of times. \n\nSo you're essentially left with option #1, since you don't want to be any more miserable at work than you already are. \n\nExcept that, you know, this shit has been going too far for far too long. \n\nNot just in the Military, but outside even. For too long, these Christians have been allowed to roam the country and spout the most racist and homophobic shit with no consequences because they know no one will do anything. They'll take your freedom because it doesn't align with their vision of what freedom is. They'll take away your books because it makes them look bad. They'll take your children from you, because you are in love with the wrong person. \n\nFor too long, they have been allowed in positions of power, making the lives of anyone with opposing views miserable.\n\nSo, for my own mental health, I have decided I need to speak up, even if it'll get me in trouble. At work, I have started calling my superior out on his bullshit Christian values in front of others. Any comment he makes that is out of line, I'll tell him how \"that's not very Christian of you.\" Hates homeless veterans? \"Wow, what would God say about helping others?\" \"Loves that Mexicans are being shipped to Brandon's house?\" Yep, what good morals you have! \n\nOnce in a while, he'll feign ignorance and ask me what I mean. I grew up Catholic, so I'll tell him that I don't remember being taught to be so ignorant, so selfish, and just overall a bad person. \n\nOverall, I am just trying to make people realize how fucking disgusting he is. For a long time, I used to think that \"whatever bad values you have, just leave them at home.\" I have come to realize that is wrong, too. No, don't leave that shit at home. Don't go home to beat your wife because she didn't make dinner, or your kids because they talked back. That is exactly what this country has done for the last few decades, and it has all come to bite us in the ass.\n\nFor too long we have kept quiet. We have let people pass on these horrible traits to their children. Their children grew up thinking that diversity is bad, that God is the only thing that matters and any opposition is inherently wrong. They grew up being told that a woman's place is in the kitchen, that black people are inferior, that poor people don't deserve to be helped. They grew up knowing only Christian hatred, and they're becoming loud once again. \n\nHere is how I see it: the people who are supposed to be there to help you, guide you, bring you the \"love of God,\" are the most judgemental, pieces of shit human beings I have ever met. They'd rather let you rot in misery before helping you. I'm not talking about giving you money in the time of need, or a bed during a cold night out. I'm talking about helping society become better for everyone, not just the people they deem worthy. \n\nThey will tell you in your face that rape is justified, that only their definition of love is what matters, that kids deserve to die of cancer because \"God works in mysterious ways.\" They'll spit you in the face and tell you it's your fault. They'll do this with no remorse, because they know that on Sunday someone will tell them that they did God's work.\n\nThese people have roamed free of consequences for far too long, and they've gotten too comfortable. They deserve to know when they're out of line, and we clearly we need to remind them of it. \n\nPlease, do your neighbor, your friend, your family member, and do society a favor:  don't stay quiet anymore. Don't expect to change these people minds, but let's aim to influence those arounds us. \n\nLet's be the change that needs to be made, one voice at a time.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678037101.0},{"title":"All the apologetics for the unequal treatment of both men and women's roles in religions is frankly terrible","author":"donotholdyourbreath","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11jk0pf\/all_the_apologetics_for_the_unequal_treatment_of\/","text":"Saw a few apologetic videos of Islam.

The Church exists ONLY because of the resurrection  \n2. Therefore the Resurrection happened  \n3. The Resurrection is proof of God's power and hence proof of God  \n4. All objections are then debunked (unless you can think of another?)   \n5. Question. If the Resurrection didn't happen, what kickstarted the Church instead, that fits the evidence.\n\nThe long, wordy, preachy, sneering version:\n\nYou can ridiculously deny God exists, even that Jesus existed, but you CANNOT deny that the Church exists, because there is a church building on every street corner, housing a congregation that has proclaimed the SAME GOSPEL message since day one. \n\nYes, different denominations have different peripheral traditions today, but the core doctrines are still the same whatever the denomination, whether Catholic or Orthodox, Baptist or Methodist, Anglican or Reformed. \n\nWherever any first century church congregation was sited, it proclaimed the SAME gospel. The Church congregation in Spain, founded by James, independent from any scripture, proclaimed the same gospel, independently of the Christian Church congregation in Rome. They independently proclaimed the same gospel as the congregation in India, founded by Thomas in 50AD, before the New Testament was even written. That church proclaimed the same gospel as the congregation in Jerusalem, or the church congregations in Galatia, Ephesus, Colossae, Hierapolis, Corinth, Philippi, Thessaloniki, and dozens of other places. All the SAME gospel, ALL proclaimed independently, and ALL proclaiming the same CHRIST and what happened to him. \n\nAnd that same Church in its entirety, collectively, whatever the denomination, can trace its roots in an UNBROKEN line, to the Christian Church's  beginning around 33AD after ONE event. Before that one event, the church did not exist. After it, it did. \n\nThe Christian Church HAD to start at a point in time, because it exists today, it has existed for 2000 years, but there was a day when it didn't. And the next it did, and spread like wildfire. In 33AD there was no church. By 35AD, without main roads, rail, air, email, Twitter or Facebook, it had spread across the Roman Empire and beyond, and every one of those Churches proclaimed the same gospel. \n\nSo what was this church founded on? \n\nThe Church was not founded on Jesus' teaching. There were many rabbis at that time, including John the Baptist, none of whom founded a church. \n\nNor was it founded on any \"martyrdom\" on the Cross or anywhere else. John the Baptist was executed, martyred, yet a church never grew up round him. Nor James (beheaded by the Romans), nor any of the other Apostles. \n\nIt was not founded on Jesus' miracles, nor on Judaism, nor on the death of Jesus.   \nIt was not founded by Paul either, who was still a Pharisee PERSECUTING Christians when the Church began, and did not start writing his letters to individual congregations until around 50AD, congregations that had already existed, proclaiming the Gospel, for over a decade.\n\nIt was not founded by Constantine either (LOL) because he did not live until the 4th century, hundreds of years after Christianity and the Christian gospel had already spread from Spain to India, from Northern Europe to Africa. \n\nIt was not founded on Jesus' words. It was not founded by the disciples. It was certainly not founded on the Bible because the Church began around 33AD and the first New Testament book was not written until 50AD or later. \n\nIt was founded on ONE event and one only. \n\nBefore that one event, the disciples were a motley crew hiding behind locked doors, for fear it was their turn on the Cross next. After that one event, they were immediately transformed into the most dynamic evangelistic force the world has ever known. Overnight. They left their locked doors behind and fearlessly went out into the streets, even in the same city where Jesus was put to death days before, proclaiming the reason for WHY they proclaimed the gospel of Christ. And proclaiming that event not to obscure goatherds  in the local fields, but to the VERY people who condemned Jesus and murdered him. \n\nThe disciples were ridiculed, beaten, tortured, imprisoned and most were eventually killed. The execution of Stephen, as an example, is recorded in gruesome detail in Acts 8. His site of execution is STILL preserved in Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley. His remains were scattered across the Roman Empire. Part of his arm bone still rests in St Sergius Church in Russia. Martyrdoms of the earliest Christians are well attested. James' execution, for example, was attested by Josephus, in part of his work that has NEVER been questioned by absurd, babyish atheists like you. \n\nThe Disciples and other followers suffered brutally, yet continued to evangelise, because of one event only. \n\nAnd that one event that began the Church was the Resurrection of Christ. The disciples  didn't just preach it in some backwater. They proclaimed it from the rooftops, they proclaimed it in the market place, in the synagogues, even in the Temple itself, in the VERY city where Jesus was executed just days before, in front of those who executed him. They were arrested, tortured, even ridiculed by people  like you, but they refused to back down, even under persecution, for something they KNEW to be true.\n\nThe fact is that the disciples knew Jesus well. They had spent three years with him 24\/7. They saw him crucified, and knew he was dead. Yet a couple of days later they were utterly, utterly convinced that they saw him alive - not just a weak, resuscitated zombie, but more alive than ever, glorified, and vibrant. \n\nDid they make it up? \n\nWell, people sometimes give their lives for something they believe to be true - even suicide bombers. But NO ONE gives up their lives for something that they KNOW to be a LIE. \n\nSo no. The disciples \"making it up\" makes, NO sense. \n\nThe simple fact is that the disciples and other followers saw Jesus publicly executed. He was dead. Romans didn't make mistakes. If a crucifixion was botched the punishment was that the Roman executioners were executed in the place of the victim, and the victim despatched properly afterwards. Jesus was dead, period. Crucifixion and a spear thrust into his heart ensured that.\n\nAnd this was attested not only in the independent gospels, not only by witnesses like John who clearly attested it, not only in the extra-canonical documents, but even in Roman and Jewish histories (Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus, Pliny, etc) the oral traditions of the Church congregations before scripture was even written, as well as archaeology such as the Alexamenos Grafitto. He was dead, period. \n\nThat was on the Friday. And yet on the Sunday after the death of Jesus, the disciples were utterly, utterly convinced that they had not only met the risen, glorified Christ, but they had walked with him, talked with him, touched him and even eaten with him.\n\nNor were they the only witnesses to the Resurrection. \n\nThis Resurrection was experienced by hundreds in the first few weeks with the new \"Christians\" seeing Christ alive, not as some half dead zombie, or a ghost, but in a vibrant new state of being. \n\nResurrection does NOT mean the resuscitation of a corpse! It is the raising to a new life, a new, glorified and immortal state of being, just as Jesus promised would happen. The Resurrection was predicted by Jesus many times in his ministry, first off as a unique event by Jesus but also as a forerunner to the final Resurrection of all who follow Jesus. And he kept his promise.\n\nOnly after the Holy Spirit anointed the followers and they received Christ's Spirit, did the appearances of the risen Christ stop. But because the Holy Spirit was poured out on all those who trusted in him, that same Spirit has anointed the Church ever since. Many attempted to quash the gospel. People like you still try to do it today. But the Christian Church is alive and thriving, growing phenomenally across most of the world. That same Church you see on your street corner has proclaimed the Resurrection ever since it happened, and STILL proclaims it today. \n\nWe have a full, unbroken record of the Resurrection gospel going right back to the day it happened. The Resurrection was the event that started the Church. And without it the Church would never have existed.\n\nThink about that for a moment. \n\nPut simply,   \nThe mere existence of the CHURCH today is, itself, proof of its founding and therefore proof of the Resurrection event that founded it.   \nThe Resurrection is, itself, proof of the power of God.  \nThe power of God is proof of God.\n\nMany ridiculous theories have been put forward by absurd atheists like you who, when confronted with the Resurrection (and hence its proof of God) desperately try to make excuses about it.\n\nAnd I'll tell you this for free. I've heard all the excuses, so don't bother. And like everything else here, I can wipe the floor with all of them:-\n\n\"The whole story of the crucifixion and Resurrection was made up\"   \nWhy? To bring fame and fortune to the disciples? The same disciples whose \"reward\" was persecution and death? \n\n\"Jesus didn't really die on the Cross but just fainted, and came round in the tomb\"   \nYeah, right. Lol That shows the level of understanding of Roman culture as reflected in the intellect of a flat earther. \n\n\" The body was stolen by the Jews\/disciples\/Romans\/Aliens\/Donald Trump  \nSo why did they not produce it to stop the rumours of the Resurrection, an event  that threatened to destabilise the Greco\/Roman\/Jewish world? \n\n\" The women went to the \"wrong\" tomb\"  \nYou mean the only tomb in the area where they saw Jesus buried just a short time before? \n\n\" it was all a\" plot\" or \"hoax\" by the Jews\/Romans\/disciples\/Republicans\/the pope\"  \nWhy? The last thing the Jews etc wanted was a rumour of a Resurrection!! \n\n\" The disciples were hallucinating,   \n... despite hallucinations being PERSONAL experiences not corporate. \n\n\" Jesus still lies dead in a tomb somewhere\"  \nDoes he? Then why is it not a shrine? \n\n\"Resurrections don't happen\"   \nLOL and, according to some, people could not travel to the moon in the 1960s\/70s\n\n\"Jesus' 'twin brother' (WHO???) or someone else, died in his place  \nWhat evidence is there he had a twin brother? Talk about scraping the barrel fir excuses! \n\n\" the independent Bible accounts do not agree\"   \ner... yes they do... \n\nEtc etc\n\nPerhaps you can think of one of your own. But, like these, I guarantee I will destroy it as I have irrefutably destroyed these in the past. \n\nAs I said above, \n\nThe existence of the Church is, itself, proof of the Resurrection.  \nThe Resurrection is, itself, proof of the power of God.  \nThe power of God is proof of God.\n\nIn addition there are other pieces of evidence worth mentioning. First, women in those days were deemed unreliable witnesses. They were not allowed to testify in court. If the Resurrection was made up, then no sane person would have the records of it confirming that women (eg Mary) proclaimed it to the disciples. Yet they did report this, for the only reason that it must have happened. \n\nThe site of the Resurrection was immediately recognised and proclaimed, BUT IT WAS NEVER REGARDED AS A SHRINE, as were the burial tombs of the Apostles. Instead it was well documented and preserved as the site of the RESURRECTION until 70AD when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and buried the tomb. But the site was remembered and its location passed down through the church. In the 4th century, the tomb was excavated, and a church built over it. Since then that same empty tomb has still been recognised as the site of the Resurrection. Though replacement churches have been built over the tomb over the years, the current Church of the Holy Sepulchre can still be visited in Jerusalem as well as the tomb still inside it, where the Resurrection took place, constituting real, physical, archaeological evidence of an event that has an unbroken chain of witness going right back to the Resurrection itself. Few other sites of the ancient world, if any, have such provenance. \n\nFinally, there are a huge wealth of writings affirming the Resurrection, even from some hostile sources not only the Bible, including  many first century writings that are also not in the Bible, including the 1st century Didache, the 1st century works of Justin, Ignatius, Clement and others. Paul proclaimed the Resurrection to the Churches in around 55AD, just 20 years or so after it happened, to the same churches that had already proclaimed it for decades, while people who had witnessed it were still alive. Remember that those Churches had proclaimed the Resurrection for decades before Paul wrote to them. In other words they proclaimed the Resurrection from day one. The Church in Spain proclaimed it, as did that in Ephesus, as did that, founded by Thomas in India in 40AD. EVERY church proclaimed it, because it was the sole reason for their existence. \n\nMoreover, there is not ONE ancient source, even written by those hostile to Christianity, like the Romans, Greeks or Jews, that has EVER debunked, questioned, disproved, or even negatively mentioned the Resurrection, despite their annoyance and chagrin at the explosion in the church based solely on this ONE event. \n\nIf you can give me one, then name it.\n\nA classic book called \"Who Moved the Stone\" was written by Albert Henry Ross using the pseudonym Frank Morrison. He was a militant atheist who wrote it as a means of disproving the Resurrection, by actually examining the evidence as in a court case. However the upshot was that he changed his mind, realised that the Resurrection was fact, and became a Christian based on his findings. \n\nI could go on. But that gives you enough to consider for the moment. \n\nNow, prove me wrong. If you disagree with this:-\n\n\\*\\*\\*TELL me what began the church instead. \\*\\*\\*\n\nYou obviously did not know what started the Church. Now you do. And if you disagree, then you need to explain why, WITH EVIDENCE. Tell me what started the Church instead. I'm looking forward to systematically taking it apart. \n\nI won't accept nonsense like \"this isn't proof of the Resurrection\". The fact is that the Church's very existence is because of the Resurrection. Without it, there would be no Church. If the Resurrection did not happen and the Church began some other way, then... tell... me... what... it.... was. \n\nI also won't accept \"we don't know\" because we DO know. It was the Resurrection. That is the accepted reason that the WHOLE Christian Church proclaims, whatever the denomination, for it is its sole raison d'etre. \n\nYou won't accept this, I know. So you need to tell me what kick started the Church instead that fits with the evidence.  As you won't accept the resurrection and its proof of God. you need to tell me why you believe the disciples, the writers in the first and subsequent centuries, the sum total of the Christian Church over 2000 years, and even those 1st century people hostile to Christianity who couldn't provide an alternative, are all liars, and you're the only one here telling the truth.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678055784.0},{"title":"(Joke) Why do christians think Jesus was white?","author":"starcap","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11iosrl\/joke_why_do_christians_think_jesus_was_white\/","text":"Because the guy at church said he was made out of crackers.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677994567.0},{"title":"The stupidity or the genius of blasphemy laws?","author":"WaterDemonPhoenix","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11jdywf\/the_stupidity_or_the_genius_of_blasphemy_laws\/","text":"You decide.

I'm not religious but I was raised through Christian Science (not scientology lol). Anyway I thought I might share the argument.\n\nScouring the overview of monotheistic religions (religions that believe in one true god), the properties generally circumvent the trifecta of power. A god is:\n\n* Omnipotent (all powerfull)\n* Omniscient (all knowing)\n* Omnipresent (everywhere at the same time)\n\nIf a god does not encompass one of these elements, it's no longer considered a god (right?).\n\nIf you accept this, then there is absolutely no need to be religious \/ believe in god. If god (who doesn't exist) wanted me to believe in his existence it would have convinced me of his existence through methodology that I would accept. In my case (which god knows and understands right?) that would be something scientifically reproducable. \n\nAunt: But god is giving you little messages all the time!\n\nBut god is omniscient, and therefore he knows how I think, why I think that way and what I would need to believe in him. He's omnipotent, so he must have the capacity to do so. Communicating to me about his existence using mystrious, wishy-washy messages of causality or coincidence won't sway me (and he know this lol).\n\nAunt: But the Bible says...\n\nSure. But if god is omniscient he will know that I'm unconvinced by the content and as he's omnipotent he has the ability to produce evidence that would convince me.\n\nUncle: Can't you feel his presence? \n\nNo. I'm sure I could. If god would adhere to my requirements for acknowledgement.\n\nAnd so it goes. In summary, it's all about the power and knowledge that a god has to remove ambiguity concerning his excistence and his requirements (church). Ergo there are two options: \n\n1. God exists but doesn't require believers followers \/ religion. Believing is inconsequential\n2. God doesn't exist \n\nMy family does not talk about religion with me any more.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678025296.0},{"title":"25 \"Prophets\" who said Trump would win the 2020 election","author":"charismactivist","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s8BNNTueyN8","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677944577.0},{"title":"\"Pro-life\": Women who seek abortion in South Carolina could face death penalty under a proposed new bill.

She sounded more presuppositionalist than anything else.\n\nLastly, she railed on the destruction of Babylon \u201cprophecy\u201d pretty hard for most of the e-mail. Not once did she actually address the problem of knowing how a prophecy was fulfilled, rather than jumping to the conclusion that it must be divine intervention. She finished off by saying she wanted to talk to me even more about that specific subject.\n\nOverall, she didn\u2019t really address my main questions and concerns, and wasted most of her time on a topic that wouldn\u2019t convince me of her god\u2019s existence, even if 100% proven. Generally unsurprised, though.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should respond, or what anyone else here would do.

But physical interactions do not distinguish between forward and backward in time. Bounce two protons off of each other and their paths will be the same whether the interaction is made forward or in reverse.\n\nCausality is actually a statistical phenomenon that we interpret as cause and effect. It is highly unlikely that 15 pool balls will land in a perfectly racked position with the cue ball in place. It is not impossible. But more importantly, our direction of time is determined by a state of massively low entropy called the Big Bang. Our ability to experience anything is tied to a low-to-high entropy gradient. That does not mean that all entropy flows in the same direction in all of existence.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nWell for one thing, it disqualifies the question \"Why?\" in the cosmological sense. If there is no universal requirement for cause, then there could be no ultimate reason. There certainly would be no requirement for infinite regress. There's no need to require a universe \"from nothing\" because \"from\" is synonymous with \"caused by\" in this sense; and \"nothingness\" is already proven to be false\n\nLet's also be sure about one thing\n\nEven if this worldview is true, it still means nothing for pragmatic purposes. We exist in a teeny fraction of existence and time moves in the same direction for all of us here. We may or may not have the illusion of free will but we have no choice but to continue making choices as ourselves within our limited social and physical worlds.\n\nAny ideas on the term for this?\n\n\"Super determinism\" is already taken and also still carries causality associations. \"Nihilism\" is more concerned with the lack of purpose than I really agree with.

It\u00b4s about a man striking down a suposed holy tree but he didn\u00b4t get smithen by god - rather nothing happened. The man obviously was a christian and the followers of whatever cult just got called out quickly jumped ship and joined Christianity. Do you think the mistake was to clearly define the tree as holy and god as someone who will always clearly smithe the heathens. Christianity does it better but you need to understand that Christianity has some very deep flaws that will oneday be it\u00b4s downfall. For starters: the christian god isn\u00b4t omnipotent.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the biggest problems of christianity because what is infinity if not god. The muslims figured out parts of that problem but most of it is still deeply illogical.

I know this subreddit is not unbiased but I don't know where to ask about my questions so please help me.\n\n* Firstly, to counter the  problem of evil: why an all-loving, almighty god allow evils to exist - the answer is free will: God allow human to do things by their free will, therefore they do awful things to others. But if He stopped them, they would lose their free will. And of course the almighty god cannot find a better way to solve this problem.\n\nBut the thing is, I don't think it makes sense. Why stopping evils destroys humans' free will? Let's say if you want to jump from the top of a skyscraper and survive, but you do it then die, does that mean your free will is violated? Of course not, right? You are still free to choose to do it or not, and face the consequence.\n\nSo what if God made human still free to commit sins like murders, rapes, etc... but die right after, just like when they jump from the top of a skyscraper? Again, they would be still free to choose to do it or not, and face the consequence, but the crimes and sufferings will reduce greatly, right?\n\nThe fact is, God never gives human total freedom. We still don't have complete control over our bodies, our senses, our knowledge, even our thoughts and our actions are limited. So when we are already limited so much, why God doesn't limit us a bit more, to prevent our suffering? We can still use our \"free will\" (whether it actually exists or not) to create things like arts, right? Why he allows us to kill and harm, but not enjoy extreme sports like jumping from skyscrapers?\n\n* Second is the idea that \"God Works in Mysterious Ways\": people use this to explain why God to something that they can't explain, like the above problem of evil. Because God has some great goals and how he operates is beyond our understanding. And again the almighty god cannot find a better way to explain himself clearly to us, but still want us to trust him.\n\nBut then, how do you explain the holy books, the commandments, the revelations, the angels and prophets? Why the mysterious god choose the be very clear and particular about all those things, like what foods you should eat, that you should not have gay sex, etc... ? He is very non-mysterious here, even if he still doesn't reveal himself directly and says what he want clearly to us, but keeps hiding and relies on middlemen like some guys in the middle east or some churches and authorities to communicate to us.\n\nIt seems particularly different from his modus operandi - being mysterious. So the question is: why we can be sure it's actually him that commands us to do those things? What is it's actually the Devil all along? What if the true test of him is to see if we fall to the Devil's trap and start believing in some man-made books? What if only the atheists can go to heaven?\n\nWhat should we believe in? If God created us, then aren't our feelings and reasons also his creation as well?  If a man-made book say we should do something, but our heart and our mind say different, what should we believe in?  Should Abraham offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice to god?","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677840935.0},{"title":"Rabbi blames Israel earthquakes on LGBTQ+ community: \u2018God said you are shocking your people\u2019.","author":"Leeming","url":"https:\/\/www.thepinknews.com\/2023\/03\/02\/rabbi-blames-israel-earthquakes-on-lgbtq-community\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677771564.0},{"title":"Grief and Atheism- insomniac thoughts about how comfort can be given as an Atheist","author":"adastraperabsurda","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/11gvov8\/grief_and_atheism_insomniac_thoughts_about_how\/","text":"As an atheist, I have a very pragmatic sense when it comes to death. I don\u2019t share that part with people because it rarely comforts them to talk about thermodynamics and stardust. \n\nBut lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about difficult it must be for others to find comfort or relief in grief with atheism like I do. Mostly because I\u2019m now in this odd stage of my life where there are fewer weddings and more funerals- I see people who are deeply religious grasp onto the traditions their religions to find anchors in the seas of grief.  And I think that\u2019s how religions really get people. Because in the most vulnerable times- it gives easy answers to complicated questions and feelings. \n\nSo if you are here, looking for ways to figure out how to give comfort with grief- I thought I would share.  And I hope you guys add to this too. It\u2019s not for everyone- it\u2019s just what I do to comfort others. \n\n1) I always reach out when someone is grieving but not through social media. I do it with text messages, written notes, food. I do it the moment I see something because I know that moment is not the moment of death per se but the moment that they can compose something and the moment they start bracing for the impact of death. It\u2019s a harsh reality. Carbs help. \n\n2) I always try to hug a person- friend of family.  I try to gauge it (yes, I ask) but really, all of the science says that it helps with the release of oxytocin. At least a six second squeeze. \n\n3) I follow up.  Especially before the first Christmas or holiday season. It\u2019s so hard during that time and it can be so damn awkward.  But I do it anyway. \n\nI know it\u2019s weird to put this out there.  But I have had two friends tell me how they don\u2019t know how I am an atheist after losing so many people in my life.  My feelings about it are that I miss them every day and I set aside one day a year to really remember them. Same day each year I drink a little scotch, listen to music, write down a few memories. Nothing big. But there is always a little crying. \n\nI also don\u2019t try to understand their deaths.  Or try to fantasize about time travel miracles.  Or try to attach a meaning to it. Because it detracts from their life. And that\u2019s really what we leave- the impact on others lives. \n\nI hope this helps and that others share how they deal with grief and atheism.  I also hope that no one takes this is some kind of authoritative guide: every grief is different.  But because atheism is amorphous and non-communal in nature I thought a conversation might be helpful.  \n\nAnd forgive me. I probably shouldn\u2019t be posting this at 3:30 am.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677832812.0},{"title":"Youth drag show canceled in Roseville after community uproar","author":"AJerk2SomeButtNotAll","url":"https:\/\/www.abc10.com\/article\/entertainment\/television\/programs\/to-the-point\/youth-drag-show-canceled-roseville\/103-eaa7d68c-396f-4846-870c-48ef40141b71","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677786952.0}]
