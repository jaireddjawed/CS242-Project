I approached this by setting their time derivatives equal to 0 to keep these values constant, thus ensuring the above.\n\n**My question**: Is this a correct approach or should I ensure constant values of selected input parameters differently or \"more efficiently\"?\n\n**My concern**: Although everything works (somehow), I wanted to check.\n\nThanks!",

I have trouble finding some information in english textbooks. Maybe I have not looked hard enough though.\n\nI posted an image of the table of contents that pretty much shows most of the topics I would like to study\nmore. Unfortunately I cannot take this book home.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for textbooks in english or french that I could find on libgen.\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

I wanted to know how math is thaught in the USA, what do you learn (in which grade) and what's the level? I graduated high school in Belgium with the 'highest' degree in maths (Science and Mathematics ASO) last year. \n\nI have had a look on the internet but I didn't quite find what I was looking for. I also had a look at some SAT practice tests; I made the math part without any preparation and had al 20 questions correct in about 20 minutes. However, I found it rather easy. So is this really the level of math they teach in the US, or are the SATs just a bit too easy for students?\n\nAnyway, I just want to be prepared. So let me know your own experiences. \n\nThank you in advance :)",

        "text": "I just recently finished my first semester of graduate school in Engineering and was a bit disheartened by the teaching methodology chosen by some of my professors: reading from slides rather than writing on a chalkboard (or any surface).  I prefer the chalkboard method as the lecturer \"learns with their student\", and builds to a result from a proof rather than displaying it.  I've found that it is difficult for me to learn (let alone appreciate the material) from slides as I'm not digesting the information gradually and I am just rewriting the information and trying to keep up.  As a result, I don't learn much in class and I have to spend more time outside of class to inexpertly reteach the content; this takes away time from my research progress and I leave the class at the end of the semester learning less than I could have if the lecturer didn't use the slides approach.\n\nMoving forward, my plan of study is very theoretical and many professors, unfortunately, prefer to read from their slides because it is less work as they can reuse their lectures and write less during class.  I understand their desire to optimize their time, but it is hard to digest rigorous material from Beamer slides.  For context, I have undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Engineering.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of this, it is unavoidable as Beamer is used throughout conferences, talks, and seminars; I need to adjust.  Does anyone have a technique that works for them or feels similar?",
