All I can remember from the riddle is that it starts with \"My neighbors aren't doing well\", references America as \"the man across the street's teenage son who ran away\", that it references Algeria, and that the answer is France.\n\nCould any of you help me out?",

On November 5th, 2017 at 2:15 am, security camera footage shows an explosion next to a bank, leaving a hole in the side of the building, then immediately after the explosion, the footage shows a man running into hole created by the explosion at full speed. 5 minutes later at 2:20am, the same man is seen sprinting out of the bank with a sack full of cash.\n\nPolice have matched the DNA and evidence left at the scene of the crime with a suspect, and the detective and police arrive at the house of the suspect to arrest him. When they ring the front door, the man answers the door in a wheel chair, with his left leg in a cast. During questioning, the detective asks the man \"where were you on November 5th, 2017 at 2:15am?\"\n\nThe man replies that he was in the hospital ER, getting a cast put on his broken leg.\n\nHospital records confirm that the man checked into the Hospital ER at November 5th, 2017 2:12am with a broken leg. The hospital is located about 8 minutes away from the bank. An X-Ray confirms that the leg is genuinely broken, and that there's no possible way that the man would have been able to run on it, as shown by the security camera. However, the detective is convinced that the man is guilty of committing the bank robbery.\n\nWhat is the detectives reasoning?\n\n(Remember your spoiler tags please.)",

        "text": "(Possible repost, unsure) \n\nThere is a room which has three light bulbs inside and outside the room there are three light switches. You are offered a challenge whereby you have to figure out which light switch corresponds to which bulb. The only thing is you can only go inside the room with the light bulbs once and you can only answer with 100% accuracy which light switch does which light. You can flip the switches as many times as you want but once you leave the room with the bulbs in, you have to give your answer. Here are some extra rules to follow.\n\n1. You are doing this on your own. You cannot have a friend flip the switches while you are inside the room or have him enter while you flip the switches.\n\n2. While outside the room you cannot see I to the room or how much light is coming out. I.E you can’t flip a switch then look into the room and switch another.\n\n3. There is no time limit or limit to the number of times you can flip the switches\n\n4. Once you are inside the room the switches lock and cannot be switched until you leave the room (no cheeky string attached)\n\n5. You have to give your answer with 100% certainty of which switch is for which bulb. So you can’t figure one bulb then guess the other two\n\n[What strategy do you use to ensure you win the challenge?](/b)",
