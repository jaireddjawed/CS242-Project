        "text": "So, first thing I want to give you guys a bit of background. I am a 22 year old Vietnamese girl, I have a normal life since I was born, my family is a normal middle class one, never been into anything occult or shady that I know of. I live in a populated area in Ho Chi Minh City and I have never seen anything out of the ordinary... that is, until today.\n\nAs many of you guys know, 2023 has just come, about 5 days into 2023 now, but we're still not done celebrating as there's still a Lunar New Year coming up. It's around this time that my family want to clean the whole house to let out all of the bad energy and \"embrace\" the new year. So. it started when my mom woke me up at 7:00AM to clean, I was given the task of the attic, since both my parents have bad ankle problems and my brother was out for school. \n\nSo I had breakfast, a few nagging here and there from my mom at me for being so young but so lazy at the same time. I didn't mind them very much since I know they come from a place of love, also, this activity always happens every year, so I just don't mind it very much. My house is a normal 3 story house, my family used to have relatives who lived here for some times until they're more financially stable to move out, so now the 3rd floor is currently rented by my university friend. He has gone back to his hometown for Lunar New Year with his family since we're all done with our semester. His room is right next to the attic entrance.\n\nThe attic is quite dusty and dark, with quite many boxes of books and family albums, old stuffs from my deceased grandparents that my dad doesn't want to throw out. I have to clean up the attic, find stuffs from last year that are either too broken to be repaired/out of use and then clean up the mess on the 3rd floor after I'm done dusting. I put on my earplugs and began to dust the whole place, when I was done, I looked through the box that wrote 2022 on it (my family keep track of these things, basically it's just a pile of trash that my parents didn't want to throw but have no knowledge on how to fix them so they just pile it like \"hoarders\" on those American shows, and use this opportunity each year to tell me to clean their mess). As I was sifting through the trash piles, my eyes stumbled on what  seemed like the old family computer set, with the keyboard, monitor,... everything. I got hit with a wind of nostalgia, all my memories of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, long lost dead anime online forums, nights of playing Java games with my brother, Yahoo Messenger... if you were born in the 2000's in Vietnam then you might be very familiar with what I just described. After what felt like a good 5 minutes of reminiscing, I suddenly remembered that I can ask my mom if I can sell this old hunk of junk away for some snacks money, to my surprise, both my mom and dad were super chill about it and agreed to let me sell it away. \n\nIt took me around 1 hour to move it to my room on the second floor, I tried to clear my desk to plug it in, because still working computer and monitor can make more money. To my surprise, the old junk did work! The nostalgic Windows 2000 music hit my eardrums, and my old Admin account with the stupid picture of me and brother are still there. I decided to retrieve back every old thing on the computer, like one last goodbye before sending a piece of my childhood away. Then, I saw the desktop screen with the scenery picture of Hanoi that my mom loved, and to add more to my surprise. I saw the old Yahoo Messenger icon! Yahoo Messenger was a big thing in Vietnam during the 2000's - early 2010's, it was a thing for middle schooler, high schooler, hell, literally every young person to have a Yahoo Messenger account. It was announced dead back in 2018. \n\nExcitedly, I clicked on the application without thinking much, then strangely, it connected! I could see the log in screen and everything, as if it was never dead to begin with. I decided to experiment, I looked through my old diary to find the memo of my old account information, I thought it would be funny to show old chat logs of me and my friends again. As I hit that log in button, I was left speechless at the working site. My friends are online! I was scrubbing my eyes to double check if I was hallucinating. No. It's fucking real and working. Then, a friend of mine texted me. I didn't think of grabbing my phone to ask everyone, I just straight up chatted on Yahoo, thinking the site had a revival when I was cleaning or sleeping. (note: I translated our chat logs so everyone reading this will understand.)\n\n\"Hey, so you just joined the party huh?\"  \n\"holy shit, did something happen when i was asleep? did they revive yahoo?\"\n\nShe took a while to type, then she replied.\n\n\"Yes\"",

        "text": "For context, I live in a fairly small town in the north of England. Most of our department stores either shut down or are prohibitively expensive, so it was… strange to encounter one that had just been founded a few months prior.\n\nNaturally, it all seemed benign enough. I mean, it’s a department store opening at a weird time is all.\n\nMy first shift was a night shift. They wanted me down in the stockrooms to clean out all the shit that isn’t in season, all the dust that gathers and set out the new mannequins at their displays. I was due to work from 8pm through until 2am - it would make getting home difficult, sure, but the rate of pay was super competitive so I figured I could probably afford taxis if I wanted to carry on with it.\n\nSo my shift starts, I clock in and the place is dead silent. The store had only closed about half an hour prior so typically you’d expect some hustle as folks tried to finish up their closes, check inventory for the next day, y’know? But there was nobody there. Just me and the mannequins.\n\nI don’t know if you have ever felt a sense that you were somewhere you shouldn’t have been. That creeping sense of something deeply wrong, that tingle in the small of your back and that nervous apprehension with every step forward - like every neurone in your brain is screaming at you to turn and run, to get out before you see something you weren’t meant to.\n\nBut, regardless, I was getting paid for this. Hell, it couldn’t be anything suspicious - it was the JobCentre that referred me here and they’re only going to give you stuff that’s above board.\n\nThe lift to the lower floors was old - *really* old. Like, fold-out grate door levels of old, hear the cables creak as the car shifts up and down the lift shaft old. Was this in line with safety codes? When was this place fucking built?\n\nJust as I was beginning to question it all, I heard the bell ring. Steeling myself, I stepped forward. The place was a fucking shambles - mannequins everywhere, no sign of stock for the clothing department or the food hall, and cobwebs occupying damn near every crevice of the place. On the wall, the only clean thing in the room was a plaque, listing a set of rules.\n\nRule 1: Clock in at exactly 8pm. Clock out at exactly 2pm.\nRule 2: Leave lights on in rooms you are not occupying at all times.\nRule 3: The security cameras are not ours. Avoid them.\nRule 4: If you hear movement, leave the room. Do not investigate. Do not turn around.\n\nWhat the fuck had I signed up for? Was this their idea of a fucking prank?\n\nNext to the plaque was a dustpan and brush. With a sigh, I picked it up and began working.\n\nFirst, I dusted off the floor. All seemed well enough. Then, I began to arrange the seemingly disorganised mannequins. I began to try and get rid of the webs when I heard it.\n\nA whisper, but loud enough to echo through the whole complex:\n\n“Look at me.”\n\nImmediately, I felt my body begin to freeze up. Quickly, and near-silently, I progressed through a door into the next room. I checked my phone - 12am. Another two fucking hours.\n\nI continued to work, despite my nerves. My workflow was the same - sweep, tidy, cobwebs. Simple.\n\nThen I remembered. The light. I had forgotten the light.\n\nTaking a deep breath to settle my nerves, I walked back through the other room - making sure to turn the lights on as I left. As I looked around, I began to process something. The room was in a worse state than when I had first entered.",

        "text": "I just killed a spider. It was a common house spider, the kind you see on a regular basis. No big deal, right? Well, ever since an incident I had with them recently, I never want to see another one of those ugly bastards again.\n\nYou see, when I was a child I got diagnosed with a crippling phobia of arachnids. I am more afraid of spiders than the usual person, and I experience panic attacks or even faint when I see one. This makes life a bit difficult for me, because I just so happen to live in Australia. Yeah, the continent that is associated with having huge spiders. \n\nI live in a pretty wealthy community, right in the heart of Sydney, the largest city in the country. I wasn’t born into it, I had to work for it. Months and years of working for a corporation that specializes in designing self-driving cars. This got me into the area that I live in now. I used to live in some crappy slums when I was young, in the middle of actual nowhere. A place where spiders loved to hang out.\n\nI spent my childhood, my teenage years, and my twenties living in constant fear and paranoia, waiting for the next time one of the 8-limbed demons would make its appearance. It would usually end with me on the floor covered in my own urine. \n\nThankfully, now that I no longer live in that dustbowl, I am far away from those things, and I’m currently living my best life. I’ve got a net worth of $1.8 million dollars, a beautiful wife, and an amazing daughter.\n\nSpiders come and go, I see them rarely and when I do they are small enough to make me scream like a little girl at most. My family doesn’t seem to be bothered by them, in fact, they laugh whenever I get visibly freaked out by a spider. It bothers me. They don’t understand how much it affects me as a person, how my mind and body can completely just shut-down upon seeing one. They think it’s some kind of joke, or act. \n\nLast week, my daughter called me downstairs. “What is it darling?” I said, briskly entering our living room.\n\n“Check it out!” She said, pointing at the floor. I peered around the couch to see what she was pointing at, and there I saw a black widow spider. Just sitting there on the carpeted floor, not moving. \n\nI got light headed, but didn’t faint. \n\n“JESUS CHRIST.” I screamed. “GET AWAY FROM THAT THING.” My daughter moved out of the way. My wife entered the room to see what all the commotion was about. “Oh, a spider.” She said. “Yeah, that is a goddamn black widow! That is the deadliest species on this planet!” I almost couldn’t stand, I was shaking violently and sweat was dripping down my head. My wife took care of the spider, she put it in a glass and chucked it outside in a matter of minutes. She handled it pretty well, needless to say.\n\nThat was the first time I had seen a giant, truly dangerous spider in years. Maybe even in a decade. I had forgotten about that and thought I had moved on. Well, turns out my fear still remains, and unfortunately that wasn’t the last ordeal I had with them.\n\nLast night, at midnight, I was in bed with my wife. The lights were out, and I was trying to rest. Visions of the black widow flashed in my head like a movie, and that’s when I felt something scurry across my leg.\n\nWhat the hell was that? I thought, twitching my leg violently, kicking my wife in the process. \n\nShe’s a heavy sleeper, so she was still passed out cold, I on the other hand, was a nervous wreck, sweating and panting. Fearing that I was in bed with another one of those dreaded black widows. I shifted around in bed and removed my sheets, shaking them, ready for a loose widow to fall out at any moment. But, nothing. Must’ve been the wind, I thought. \n\nI eventually fell asleep, after what felt like an hour. My dreams were unpleasant to say the least, close up shots of several beady red eyes staring at me, views of intricately made web patterns, and the distinct sight of fangs, ready to insert venom into the flesh of an unsuspecting victim.\n\nI woke up, and got up in bed. Sunlight shone through the glass window, the sky presented an array of colors, like a wonderful mosaic painting. The light rippled off the ocean like a beam of warmth and tranquility. I was calm again. I was okay. Everything was going to be fine.\n\nI felt something squish in my mouth, and as I closed my jaw after yawning I felt the burst of a spider-sack and the tickle of hundreds of baby spiders enter my palette, crawling around on my tongue and diving down my throat. I fell to my knees and began to stick my fingers in my mouth, trying to get them out. I ended up vomiting, never before have I been so utterly disgusted and horrified before.\n\nAnd there, sitting in the pile of putrid stomach bile, laid a massive, mother black widow spider, curled into a ball, embracing the touch of her fresh spawn.\n\nJesus fucking Christ. Fuck that shit.\n\nI’m moving again.",

        "text": " \n\nWhen you brain starts to shut down, when the only thing keeping you going is the promise of a hot meal, when you don’t notice that you’ve stoped shivering, that is the cold. When the memory of that lack of heat sends you into a shivering fit that not even the body heat of your partner next to you can stop, that is the cold reminding you it’s still there. Even as I type this I shiver from the memory alone, I should be dead, If the jeep wasn’t there, If there wasn’t an emergency space blanket, I wouldn’t be here. Hypothermia is horrifying, even two years after dealing with it I still suffer psychological effects akin to PTSD that cause me to violently shiver no matter the ambient temperature. The shaking itself starts in my spine, it crescendos then fades away only to start again in my core. From my core it radiates out in pulses which can be violent enough that an outside observer can take notice. \n\nSome necessary detail, the hike/trip in question was part of camp counselor training at a summer camp I had gone to since I was 12, the camp in question is located in Colorado and is pretty damn old. The trip itself consisted of two parts, the first leg of the journey was 3 miles with about 1000 feet of elevation gain ending at a log cabin built back in the 40’s. The second leg of the trip was a loop with the goal of summating a 12,352 ft peak, from there we would have circled back to the cabin, stayed the night, then made our way back to the camp proper. All in all not a very grueling trek normally, hell I had done it a few times before even, this time was a bit different though. The first leg of the trip was a-ok, I had some proboms with my frame pack since I was too damn skinny but we made it work. The second leg was the real problem, we spent the night in that log cabin and then woke up inside of a cloud. When I exited the cabin that morning I couldn’t even see a full 5 feet in front of me most the time, It was full on monsoon season (July) in that region of the rockies and due to the elevation we spent most of our time within some ridiculously thick and wet fog, which dropped the temp to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Now this wouldn’t have been a problom, except my rain gear was no longer waterproof.\n\nWe were over an hour into the hike when I made the lovely discovery that my rain coat was no longer water proof, I was saoked completely through. All of the group was tired, most were pissed off due to the weather, and all of us were hungry. Honestly the only thing motivating us to continue was the promise of a hot meal at the half way point. The husband of the camp director was supposed to meet us where the trail and a dirt road intersected, the problem was there wasn’t really a trail any more. The spring winds had blown over a fair few trees creating a wall of gnarled roots and dirt in multiple spots. It took us 2 hours to navigate around that clusterfuck and at that point nothing I had on was dry, in retrospect that’s when my condition really started to decline. We had stoped quite a few times to reorient and find a route through the mess, that’s around the time the folks I was with said my shivering became sporadic. At that point things had become pretty fogy to me, my soul focus was getting to that road and getting a hot meal. According to those I was with I would only mumble responses and just sorta rock in place. Once we started moving again I got a bit better evidently, my responses were still kinda mumbles but definitely more understandable.\n\nOnce we were past the tree falls only a marsh stood between us and that road, I remember doing my best to stay out of the water but kinda giving up part way though since the water felt warm to me. Actually at this point everything kinda started to feel warm, but I didn’t pay it any mind. Looking back on it my brain was already shutting down, I was moving forward only because that was what I was supposed to do in my mind. By the time I made though the marsh there were 3 people at the jeep, I remember seeing one of the lead counselors looking pissed and then being pissed myself. The fucker who was supposed to bring us hot food had brought us plan bagels and these little cinnamon bun looking things that were around the size of a half dollar. By the time everyone had grouped up by the jeep I had begun to sway again, this is where shit truly goes fuzzy for me. I remember leaning on another trainee and asking them to get some one, apparently what actually happened was I fell directly on to them and mumbled something about counselors before kinda going limp. My next memory was of someone's incoherent voice and my feet dragging, then I remember hoping out the jeep to vomit on the side of the road, I don’t remember getting back it. By the time my brain was staring to work again the jeep was moving and I was covered in a space blanket, I was right up against the heater too and violently shivering. I was confused as shit, I still didn’t really understand what was happening around me, just we were moving. From there I was taken back to camp, given hot food and dry cloths, then I slept. When I woke back up, that’s when things finally started to make sense to my brain. \n\nIn retrospect they should have taken me to the hospital, my brain was shutting down and damage was definitely caused. Hell I know for sure that my hypothalamus was damaged, while I don’t like to self diagnose it pretty fucking clear that Ive got some temp regulation problems along side some psychological shit. Hell Ive been shivering the entire time Ive been writing this and I’m wearing fleece lined work pants, a thick flannel, and wool socks inside of a temperature controlled building. \n\nMoral of the story, make sure your gear works and have those emergency supplies prepped and ready.",

        "text": "*Creek*\nWhat was that? Caleb wondered, lying comfortably in his bed. Crickets audibly chirping from outside. Caleb swore he heard a creeking sound, but it was probably just his childish imagination making it all up. Either way, he had woken up from his sleep.\n\n*Creek*\nThere was the noise again. \nA faint creek, underneath Caleb’s bedroom. Most definitely coming from the basement. As the young boy Caleb sat up in his bed, he closed his eyes and listened carefully, focusing on the noise. The noise was sharp and quick, only lasting about a second each, with a 15 second pause between each time he heard it. \n\n*Creek*\nThe noise was much too faint to make out, so Caleb shifted through his sheets and got out of his bed, the alarm clock on his dresser drawer read “2:32 AM”, he should have been sleeping if it weren’t for the disturbance of the noise. The moon illuminated a small portion of his room from an opened window, and a draft of cold autumn air sent a shiver down Caleb’s spine, accompanied by the eerily mysterious noise from below him. \n\n*Creek*\nCaleb then got down on his hands and knees, pressing his ear against the floorboards, hoping to hear the noise in greater detail. As he closed his eyes, a million thoughts buzzed around in his head, as to what the sound even was, he was fearful, for he was not too sure. \n\n*Creek* \nAs the noise happened, Caleb could almost make out what it was, it almost sounded like the iron door of a dog cage, swinging in the wind. At least, that’s what it sounded like to him. Caleb was scared stiff, the visceral fear of hearing the sound up close frightened him like never before. He got up from the floor, and grabbed a flashlight in his small hands, trembling with fear, sweat forming on his forehead. \n\n*Creek*\nHe decided to investigate, to find out what the source of the noise was. Caleb left his bedroom and marched down the twisted hallways of his house, making sure not to wake up his mother and father, who were in the midst of a deep slumber. His flashlight shone down the darkened chasms. \n\n*Creek*\nAs Caleb approached the basement door, the feeling of uneasiness washed over him. Caleb grabbed a hold of the door knob, and swung open the door rapidly, like a hand on a hot stove. It revealed the stairs protruding into the pitch-black basement, and as Caleb stared off into the darkness, it seemed like the darkness stared back at him.\n\n*Creek*\nCaleb eased down the steps, using his light to show the path ahead of him. That’s when he saw it, the source of the noise. His prediction was right, the sound was in-fact a dog cage, with the door swinging to and fro. His dog must have escaped from the cage in the middle of the night, and left the door open there to swing and create the loud creaking noise. Caleb smiled with relief, as the outcome could have been so much worse. \n\nCaleb closed the dog cage, so the god awful sound wouldn’t happen any longer, and he analyzed the dog cage for a moment, because something about it seemed off. The size. The dog cage was so big that it looked like it could fit an adult man inside of it. The size of the dog cage was unreasonably large, and that unsettled Caleb. He then turned back to head up the stairs to go back to bed. \n\nBut that’s when Caleb remembered something… \n\nHe doesn’t have a dog. \n\nThe monster that Caleb’s parents never told him about had escaped its enclosure, and as the beastly growl echoed from behind him, that’s when he knew he was about to meet his terrible demise.",

        "text": "It’s watching *everyone* on this subreddit.\n\nThis is the price we pay for tempting fate. We should never have posted our experiences. Some stories should be left alone. We could have simply been *glad* to survive these terrible things, rather than flocking to NoSleep in an eager rush to gloat of our triumphs. We toyed with forces beyond our understanding, and this is our comeuppance.\n\nThink about it. Think about what we’ve done. We’ve posted about ghastly ghouls and abominable apparitions. We’ve bragged of our narrow victories against unfathomably powerful forces. We’ve even, on occasion, made *jokes* in comment sections. I’m not judging you. I’m the same. Comedy is a soothing bandage for the chasms of horror that traumatic events can open in our souls. Still, evil doesn’t care about that.\n\nDon’t fool yourself into thinking that *readers* might avoid this reckoning. Even the lurkers and non-voters have contributed to the thriving nature of this dark and twisted place. You’ve caught the eye of something truly insidious.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until a *very* bad thing would find r/nosleep and turn it into a computerised haunted house.\n\nPerhaps I should explain what I’ve discovered. I have read the experiences of so many people on this subreddit. I’ve gleefully soaked up their tales of true horror, and it has become a slight addiction. In fact, I think I first noticed something unsettling because I obsessively pour over the finer details of everything I experience on NoSleep.\n\nI’ve seen things that have been there one second and disappeared the next. The early events were things that seemed like glitches with Reddit. The name of r/nosleep changed to r/sleep, but clicking on that link didn’t take me to the entirely-separate subreddit of that name; it took me to a solitary Google image of a stick figure sleeping on a mattress.\n\nI messaged countless people, searched Google, and even submitted reports of what I’d experienced. Nobody else had seen the name of the subreddit change or found the picture of the sleeping stick man. Nobody had hacked the NoSleep subreddit. There had been no glitch for anyone else. I thought, perhaps, that I had accidentally left the official Reddit site and ended up on a fake version of r/nosleep. I couldn’t really think of any other explanation.\n\nThe true terror began when events defied any form of reason.\n\nI was reading one of many NoSleep posts on rules for dealing with certain unnatural beings. When I looked at the comment section, I saw something that unnerved me. I was disconcerted, yet again, by what seemed to be a glitch. The comment had no username listed above it.\n\n*Rule 11: It is unkind to joyfully read true horror. Sticks and stones will break your bones.*\n\nThere was an almighty sound of smashing glass in my room. Soul vacating my body for a brief moment, I twisted my desk chair around to face numerous shards that were scattered across my carpet. In the centre of the wreckage was a small stone that had seemingly been hurled at my window, breaking it. I sprung to my feet and peered through the now-glassless frame. There was something on the other side of the road. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to scrub that mortifying image from my mind.\n\nWedged between two hedges, slightly illuminated by the dim glow of a nearby lamppost, I was watched by a shadowy figure. His form was emaciated and blackened. Upon closer inspection, I realised that it wasn’t a person. It was a stick figure.\n\nI screamed, tearing my curtains closed. Shuddering, I sat beneath the empty window frame with my back against the wall. I remained that way for the next seven hours. I didn’t sleep, unless it counts as rest to persistently daydream of a lurking stick man.\n\nIt turned out that he wasn’t a figment of my imagination. It was quite clear, even before learning of Rule 11, that the watchful stick figure only harboured sinister intentions.\n\nIn class, I struggled to listen to my teacher. During breaks, I struggled to engage in conversations with my friends. My head was elsewhere. And I know this might sound foolish, given the warning it had sent to me, but I was *obsessed* with the concept of this horrifying spectre. I had become the very definition of morbidly curious.\n\nI browsed NoSleep, looking for clues. The ‘Rule 11’ comment had vanished without a trace, but I tirelessly read posts, searched for edited descriptions or images, and even scoured comment sections for anything untoward. I found nothing. That didn’t put me at ease, however. It only *worsened* my fear. At least the stick figure hadn’t seemed so threatening as a static, pixellated image on my screen. On the other hand, in real life, the crooked figure had been the most terrifying thing I’d ever seen.\n\n*Why me?* I wondered.\n\nI sent out requests for help from people who had endured unexplainable supernatural experiences. Somebody by the name of Archie Bolton replied:\n\n*This has the hallmarks of greycode (a type of code that connects occult things to the digital world). After receiving your initial message about the mattress image, I started to notice similar things on* r/nosleep*. Strange comments appeared from a poster with no username. The site description read: “I’m watching you, Archie. No sleep for you? That makes me unhappy.” And I saw two long, shadowy lines stretch towards me from the darkness of my bedroom. They looked like arms. Stick arms.*\n\nHis reply was one of many messages I received. People purported to experience similar things. After reading this post, you might notice strange things, too. I think, once it has been pointed out, it’s hard to un-notice the malevolent thing that is observing us.\n\nAfter overcoming the initial shock and terror of being watched by a being that couldn’t be explained by science, I decided to take a different approach towards this phantom.\n\nMoronic.\n\nWhen I saw my wardrobe door swing open in the middle of the night, I strode confidently towards it.\n\n“WHAT DO YOU WANT?” I cried.\n\nFrom the void of the open wardrobe, which was only a foot in front of me, two gangly stick arms protruded. They lifted me into the air, feeling like a pair of blunt knives digging into my shoulder blades.\n\n“All who use r/nosleep shall die of exhaustion,” It whispered. “They will lose the ability to sleep.”\n\nI didn’t understand what the entity was saying, but I think I was struggling to understand *anything*. I was entirely transfixed by the petrifying nothingness before me. I couldn’t distinguish anything of the stick figure, other than the pitch-black limbs that it was employing to hoist me off the carpet.\n\n“None of you should be on NoSleep,” It snarled, icily. “It is my home. *Leave*.”\n\nI howled in agony at a searing pain that suddenly emanated from the stick arms which were digging into my shoulders. I looked down at my body, which was barely visible in the streetlight pouring through my still-broken bedroom window. The flesh of my arms was changing. In utter horror, I realised they were starting to transform into the same pen-drawn stick arms as the creature in front of me. *It was morphing me.*\n\nAs I screeched in fear, the stick figure dropped me to the ground with an almighty thud.\n\n“Everyone has a choice,” It hissed. “Leave NoSleep or *join my realm*.”\n\nThe wardrobe door creaked shut. I lay on the carpet, considering my options. Initially, I was too frightened to return to this subreddit, in all honesty, but I felt I owed it to you. My arms have mostly returned to normal, but they won’t fully heal. There’s still a rigid, stick-like quality to them, even though my flesh has returned. I can barely type, but I’m soldiering onwards. I need to submit this post.\n\nThe stick figure is watching you, and it’s offering you the same options that it offered me. Leave NoSleep behind, or join it as some two-dimensional, soulless stick figure in a digital hellscape.\n\nWhat will you choose?",

        "text": "This started about a month ago. someone would knock at my door but when I’d open my door, there was nothing. At first I thought it was the local trouble makers but then I thought “why would they target me?” then it was “I'm on the 13th floor, that's a lot of effort to mess with someone”. Then again I've heard stories of kids who’ve tormented someone for months just because he looked at him funny. After the first three days I used the majority of my money to buy a camera to put outside my door. When they came knocking again I looked at my camera to see absolutely nothing.\n\nMy thought then was to point it down the hallway to see if I could watch them run away because I’m at the opposite end of the stairs and elevator. So the next day when they knocked I looked immediately and once more saw nothing, so still looking at my phone I opened my door and saw no one, and I didn’t hear any doors close so it’s not like they hide in a room. Might I add that the walls are very thin so I can hear someone at the end of the hall open and close their door. I looked at the time and took note; 1:03 PM. I was stumped, how could I win? The next few weeks I tried sitting at my door and when I heard the knock I threw the door open but once more I got nothing. Then after that I tried sitting with my door open right before 1:00 PM but then I just heard the knock from the stairs at the end of the hallway.\n\nI tried talking to the police but they said that with no real evidence or threat then they couldn’t do anything. I tried telling them that it was harassment but they just laughed and said then that every Mormon should be put on trial then. Thankfully I know a guy there that I just so happen to be friends with since elementary school; I’ll call him John. John agreed to stay up with me till 1:00 PM but after that he was gone for the night. Again at 1:00 PM I heard the knock. I jumped up from where I was sitting and shouted “there it is, right on time.” I ran to the door and opened it to again see nothing but this time when I looked down the hall I saw a leg go into the stairwell.\n\nI ran down the hall with John in tow saying something I couldn’t hear. I ran to the stairwell and opened the door just to see the leg going down the stairs. I followed skipping steps along the way, shouting for them to stop. I made it to the bottom of the stairs to see the door close. I ran through the door and ran face first into a chest, before I continue let it be said that I consider myself to be pretty tall, standing at 6’6 and when I say I ran into his chest, I hit like just below his pecks. I step back getting ready to really lay into this person but standing in front of me is no man, but a thing, a monster, a creature.\n\n Though it stood on two legs and had a head, shoulders, and two arms it was not human. Its skin was black and almost gelatinous. It wore a tattered trench coat and chimney sweep hat, and on its face was a cracked yellow, cartoon smiley face mask. Only being held on by what I could only assume to be its head. It spoke in a deep gravelly voice that sounded as if it had many voices. “You are seeking things that should not be sought. You are making a very big mistake, seek us again and you shall learn the consequences.” and with that it was off, making large strides to cover a large amount of ground fast.\n\nJust then John came up behind me, out of breath, and through gasps of air he spat out “I don't… know… what you heard… but… I heard nothing… no person… no footsteps… and definitely… no… knocking.” I just sat there in stunted silence. I tried to tell him what I just saw but I physically couldn’t. I just told him to go home and get some rest. I went up to my room passing people looking outside their rooms to check what all the commotion was but I paid them no mind. I went to bed that night, and believe me or not but I swear I heard knocking from my bedroom window just before bed. This was two days ago and the knocking has gotten worse.\n\n Now its at 1:00 PM, 1:13 PM, and 1:26 PM. I need sleep but I just can’t. It's currently 1:37 PM and I just heard a very distinctive knocking at my bedroom door at the times listed before. The clock has just hit 1:39 and I just heard it from my walls, my door, and my window. I see his face at my window and I think I see a crack. My door is splintering too, I've called the cops but they just called me the crazy knocking guy. This is my last ditch effort to get help or at the very least, get my story out there so when they find me dead, they know why.",

        "text": "I woke up in a strange room.\n\nIt all started with the sound. Strangely familiar, it cut through the blackness, crudely smashing its way into my eardrums like a wrecking ball into an unassuming wall. Although I heard the piercing sound, my consciousness remained stuck in a strange, frustrating sort of limbo state somewhere between wakefulness and slumber. I laid there for a bit as I tried to muster the strength to wake up fully, and the beep continued to grate at my ears and rattle my teeth in the meantime. With a burst of irritation, I finally got my eyes to snap open.\n\nWhite ceiling. White walls. White floor. No windows, no carpets, no lights. In fact, this room was so pristine that it was devoid of even the smallest speck of dust. It had no distinguishing features besides a single doorway, the metal bed I woke up in, and me. Despite the lack of obvious source of illumination, however, the room was brightly lit.\n\nI looked around blearily yet nervously for the source of the sound and suddenly noticed a nightstand near the bed. On it was one of those telephones you see used in offices: it had a handset, keypad, cord plugged into the wall—the whole nine yards. Except the handset was hanging by the cord. It swung gently, nearly touching the floor. I looked at it for a moment, struggling to decide if I should return the handset to its holder or get out of the room first. Within a few moments, the desire to fix this anomaly won. After all, what if this sound was putting me in danger? Who knows what lay beyond the door, and since I probably would have to confront whatever it was at some point, I might as well catch it as much by surprise as was currently possible. I reached down and took the handset gingerly, placing it as soundlessly as I could back into its holder.\n\nThe noise stopped.\n\nI exhaled, realizing that I'd been holding my breath the whole time. After a moment of relief-filling (yet crushing) silence, the phone began to beep softly. Something in my gut told me that this was supposed to happen, so I didn't touch it; instead, I focused on quietly getting out of bed. It was a bit silly, since it's not like the room was silent—the phone was beeping away, after all—but I still wanted to be as cautious as possible. I didn't know the rules of this place, if there were any. Besides, I didn't want to be careless and disrupt the peace that seemed to have only just then descended over the room.\n\nI put my feet down on the floor, one at a time. It was icy and tiled with your typical small squares. The edges of the tiles dug into my feet slightly as I stood up. I suddenly realized that my feet were bare.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked around again, both my vision and mind much clearer. The room was basically empty, like I'd thought. There weren't any mirrors, either, so I couldn't even see what state I was in. I looked down at myself. Aside from a few bruises and what felt like a couple pulled muscles, I seemed to be fine. I wasn't sure where these bruises had come from, but I somehow felt like whatever had left me here wasn't responsible for them. I then noted that I was wearing what looked like a hospital gown, which was as white and clean as the rest of the room. This creeped me out even more than I already was, and an unsettling thought entered my mind.\n\nI wasn't dead, was I?\n\n*No, there's no way,* I thought.\n\nI didn't want to admit it to myself, but subconsciously, I was pretty sure I had no way of actually knowing for a fact that I wasn't dead. I mean, I was stuck in a weird place with no memories of either my past life or who I was, so frighteningly enough, anything was possible.\n\nOh, I guess I forgot to mention that part. Yes, at some point after I'd woken up, I realized that I didn't really remember anything: my life, where I was, how I got here, who I was—nothing. I knew that I should have probably been panicking about that, but somehow, I felt strangely serene. Well, not serene, exactly—it felt more like I was in a kind of daze.\n\nIn any case, I knew I had to get out of here at some point, so I quietly walked across the large room towards the door. I placed my hand on the cold metal doorknob and took a shaky breath, swallowed heavily, then slowly turned the knob and nervously cracked open the door.\n\nI wasn't sure if I was more comforted or disturbed by the sight before me. When I peeked outside my room, I saw what looked like a somewhat narrow and completely empty and silent hallway. It was lined with identical-looking doors on the opposite side and was lit in a similarly ethereal and unexplainable way. As the initial wave of relief passed, I felt myself getting more unnerved. A cold sweat started to break out on my back. I highly doubted that I would have been lucky enough to have ended up anywhere near an exit. I suddenly remembered that the phone was still making noise, so I shut the door as noiselessly as possible and leaned back against it for a moment, thinking about what I should do.\n\nThere wasn't much to think about, though. I could either stay in this room and wait for whatever was going to happen to happen, or I could take initiative and leave. Maybe then at least I'd have a chance to escape. I fretted for a moment about having done something I wasn't supposed to. Then, I remembered that nothing had been obstructing me from leaving my room, so it seemed like whoever—or whatever—left me here was either giving me a choice or just didn't care enough to lock me up.\n\nI took another deep breath and opened the door again. Once more, I was facing the silent hallway, and it was still as empty as it had been before. Before I could chicken out, I stepped through the doorway and closed it. The faint beeping that had been accompanying me all this time was cut off, and I was left alone with the oppressive silence. I realized then that I'd begun to find the sound comforting, and without it, I felt myself getting nervous again.\n\nI took another quiet and deep breath. At the very least, the silence would help me detect in advance whatever could be wandering these halls, although there was no guarantee that whatever that... thing could be would make any noise at all. I found myself reaching for the doorknob again, and with a shock I realized that it wasn't turning anymore.\n\nI was locked out.\n\nIt seemed like the door locked automatically from the inside. *Fuck,* I groaned mentally and gritted my teeth. I *really* hoped I hadn't fucked up already, but again, anything felt possible here. I clenched my jaw, then looked around.\n\nThe hallway was *monstrous*, stretching and winding to either side of me for what felt like miles before rounding a corner at each end. It felt longer and more ominous than any other hallway I'd probably ever been in. It was just as pristine as what had previously been my room and was devoid of not only living beings, but also any furnishings or anything in particular besides the long rows of identical doors. I didn't hear anything coming towards me, so I picked a side (right) and started to walk.\n\nAlthough I truly did try to walk without making a sound, the sound of my bare feet padding across the cold floor still felt deafening to me. I found myself panicking for a second, and then I forced myself to calm down. There was not much I could do about my situation, anyway; I'd already been locked out and I couldn't walk any quieter than I already was trying to, so if there was anything wandering the halls, I couldn't do much to prevent it from finding me. Instead, I focused on sharpening my senses to the max so that, if I did encounter something dangerous, I'd be able to get away from it before it could catch me.\n\nI rounded the corner and kept walking, following my intuition. Eventually, I lost track of how many turns I'd made and how many hallways I'd gone down. I did my best to prevent myself from going in a circle, but... there were *so many* hallways, and each was as vacant and still as the last. Although I stayed as vigilant as I could throughout, I couldn't help but start eventually getting used to the monotony. I felt like I'd been walking for hours. I wasn't tired, no—only later did the strangeness of that strike me—but I knew that a very considerable amount of time had passed since I'd left the room I'd originally found myself in.\n\nJust as I began to lose hope that I'd ever see anything other than long white space, I suddenly realized that I'd noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye.\n\nI froze and looked to the left. I was standing at a sort of T-intersection of hallways, which, though not commonplace in this space, I'd still encountered before, so that wasn't the most unusual thing. What had caught my eye, though, was a set of wide double doors at the end of the branching off hallway I'd almost passed just now. Not once had I seen anything like this in all the time I'd spent walking, and the sight of something so out-of-character for this place frightened me. My heart pounded in my ears and I hesitated, unsure of what to do. On one hand, the doors seemed to not be particularly threatening, but on the other hand, I couldn't be sure that I could say the same for whatever lay beyond them.\n\nI sighed softly, then shook my head to get rid of my anxious thoughts. Standing there and endlessly contemplating a choice that I couldn't escape wasn't an option. Even if these doors didn't lead to an exit, they acted as a sort of relief from the unbroken pattern of the endless hallways. They might, at the very least, give me a clue about where I was and what I was doing here. On the other hand, maybe I was wrong and they were a dead end. But I couldn't be sure of that until I gave them a shot.\n\nI turned down this new hallway and began walking down it. After I approached the doors, I hesitated for one last time and then tried pulling on the large handles. The doors didn't budge, so I tried pushing. Of course, that's when they opened. I laughed to myself for a moment over my mistake, then refocused on the task at hand. I looked through, and then hurriedly pushed my way through the doors, still taking care to be as silent as possible about it.\n\nWindows! There were windows here! In fact, besides the double doors, the hallway was completely devoid of doors. Instead, it was lined with windows all the way to the end. I hurried to the window to my right and my eyes widened. Not only could I see what looked like the outside world, but that outside world was also... on fire. My eyes took in the brilliant reds and flashing yellows of the flames below me, the pillars of smoke rising to the infinitely soaring gray sky, the burning, dying trees. As my eyes continued to feast on the first color I'd seen in what felt like days, I noticed two more things.\n\nThe first thing that I saw was that the fire seemed to be running on loop. It was baffling and, frankly, disturbing. The trees wouldn't stop burning. I saw them collapse into sparks and ashes, and then somehow, they would rise back up and start burning anew. The grass was also afflicted with this disease. It was perpetually shriveling, poisonous black bleeding into dying green, withering to charred dust and then bursting forth again in a neverending cycle of life and death.\n\nThe second thing I noticed was the figure in the distance. To my horror, it looked like whatever or whoever it was was covered with searing burn marks all over: clothes, body, and all. As it stumbled closer through the acrid haze, I saw that the figure appeared to be a woman. She didn’t notice me and instead kept moving painstakingly forward, a step at a time. A few more steps later, she reached the edge of the field of fire and collapsed in the grass, the smoke billowing maliciously around her. She was still a couple hundred feet away from the building I was in. Even through the windows, I could hear the furious roar of the raging fire.\n\nMy feet felt frozen to the ground. *What do I do?* I thought frantically. She was not moving, and who knew how much longer she had left? I couldn’t call for any help, either; I seemed to be the only hope this person had around here, and yet I couldn’t even get down there to help her. Jumping from the window would be suicidal. I know it doesn't make sense that I would trust a total stranger—if she was even human—considering the position I was in. However, the gut feeling I had was real, and it was screaming at me that I absolutely must help whoever this was. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes and I wiped at my face, distraught, my mind racing. *What do I do?* *WHAT DO I DO?*\n\n\"I can help.\"\n\nI screamed in surprise and whipped around towards the source of the voice. Behind me was a man dressed in all black, a languid, Cheshire cat-like grin on his sharp, yet handsome face. He was leaning back against the windows casually, examining his fingernails like he hadn't a care in the world. I backed into the window I was looking through, my back pressing against the cool glass.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I barked at him. I tried to sound intimidating, but even I could hear the slight tremble in my voice. Whoever this man was, his abilities weren't to be taken lightly. I had been absolutely certain when I’d entered this hallway that there was no one else there besides me, and yet here he was. He must have appeared soundlessly behind me at some point without me even noticing.\n\nThe man looked up at me, his smile widening slightly. His piercing eyes were a brilliant, sparkling gold. He didn't say anything. Instead, he pointed down the hallway. \n\nI followed his finger and saw a sign hanging beneath the ceiling a short ways away from me. I knew for a fact that it hadn't been there before. \"STAIRS\", it read. A little person walking down stairs was drawn beside the word. Without thinking, I bolted for them, gasping out a quick instinctive \"thank you\" as I passed by the man. I heard him chuckle lightly, but I didn't look back. I shot through the doorway and into the stairwell. Down, down, down. Just when I began to wonder if the stairs would ever end, I reached the bottom and almost ran smack into a set of narrow double doors. I flung myself through them and into the open outside space, my chest heaving like a racehorse's, and looked around wildly.\n\nThere she was, still unmoving in the grass.\n\nI made a dash in her direction, and somehow, within moments, I was by her side. I coughed as I reached down for her arms, grabbing them and hauling her in short, jagged bursts of movement back towards the building. The smoke stung my eyes and burned my throat, and, unable to take the strain of pulling the woman in conjunction with the poison of the fire, I collapsed, my vision going black.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I cracked open my eyes, I noticed that something was blocking my view. It was the man again. He was standing over me, his golden eyes glimmering, the smile on his face as calm and relaxed as ever. I sat up suddenly, almost smacking him in the forehead with my own, and scooted away from him on my butt.\n\nI felt my hand brush what felt like another person's hand, and I grabbed it, realizing at that moment that it must belong to that woman. She was still lying on the grass where I'd fallen with her. I then noticed that this grass was fresh and springy, and that the air I was pulling into my lungs was clean. I must have somehow made it outside of the circle of fire and passed out in the safe zone. I wasn't sure how much time had passed since then.\n\nI eyed the man suspiciously. \"What do you want? I have nothing to give you.\" My eyes filled with tears of fear, and I felt more dread than ever.\n\nThe man looked at me for a moment silently, then looked away and let out a short laugh. \"Yes, you're right,\" he looked back into my eyes. \"You don't have anything to give me.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"Nothing that you're thinking of, at least.\"\n\nI swallowed. His voice was sonorous, smooth like the song of a double bass, but behind its musicality I could hear that this man was nothing short of absolute power and authority.\n\n\"Check on her first,\" he said, pointing at the woman.\n\nI wasn't sure what else I could do, so I followed his suggestion, turning around to assess the woman's condition. As I'd guessed, she was still lying on her stomach. With some effort, I flipped her over onto her back, then pressed an ear to her chest.\n\nI heard nothing. Horrified, I passed a hand over her burn-covered lips, hoping to feel even the faintest whisper of breath. But there was nothing.\n\nTears spilled from my eyes and flowed down my face like rivers. I wasn't sure why I was crying, then, but I knew that whoever this was was someone who I had needed to save, and I’d... I'd failed.\n\nI felt a hand on my shoulder.\n\nI stopped crying immediately, as if on command. Something told me that that was what he wanted me to do.\n\n\"Good,\" he said. I could hear the Cheshire grin in his voice again. I turned to face him.\n\n\"I couldn't save her!\" I cried. \"I was supposed to and I co-\"\n\nSomething in the man's eyes made the words die in my throat.\n\n\"Do you know why you're here?\" He asked, suddenly serious.\n\nI started to shake my head, but then I realized something and my eyes went wide. Suddenly, everything flooded back to me. I hadn't remembered anything concrete at that moment, no, but even though I couldn't put it into words, I knew.\n\nThe man inclined his head slightly, seeming pleased, though he wasn't smiling. He watched me quietly for a bit.\n\n\"This is the one time I will ever permit this,\" he spoke softly. \"I know how much you care. Do you understand?\"\n\nI nodded, and I felt the tears running down my cheeks again, try as I did to hold them back.\n\n\"You know what you have to do now,\" he murmured, then smiled again and turned, walking soundlessly away from me back to the building. \"Farewell,\" he said, raising his hand in languid goodbye.\n\nAs my vision faded to white, I noted vaguely to myself that that last smile had been different from the rest. It was warm and full of nostalgia, like the kind of smile a grandparent might have on their face as they wistfully, yet contentedly watch their grandchild play.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up to a white room. Unlike the one I had originally awakened in, this one was lined with fluorescent lights and was filled with all sorts of equipment. I then realized that I was lying in a hospital bed.\n\nWithin a few moments, the door opened and a doctor walked in. He was old and had a gray beard; he looked grave, but when he saw me looking at him, he suddenly smiled.\n\n\"What-\" I began to say, then coughed. My voice made me sound like I hadn't drunk any water in aeons.\n\nThe doctor shook his head lightly and briefly, and I didn't say anything after that. A nurse walked in afterwards, and they both checked on my condition, taking notes. The nurse then offered me some water, which I gratefully drank.\n\nEventually, the nurse left, and the doctor and I were alone.\n\n\"Do you remember what happened?\" he asked gently. I had a vague idea, but I wasn't totally sure if I remembered everything, so I shook my head.\n\nHe then concisely explained to me why I was here. There had been a fire, and my mother and I had been rushed to the hospital. I'd flatlined on them at some point, but miraculously, I came back. He said they still weren't sure how that happened considering how long I'd been dead for, technically speaking, but that they were happy to have me back. When I asked if my mother was okay, he said that in spite of the burns and smoke inhalation she'd suffered, her condition seemed to be stable. He also mentioned that, strangely enough, she had also briefly flatlined and then recovered like I had—at the very same time, too. I nodded, taking everything in, my head still hazy. After giving me another once-over, the doctor left me to myself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm writing this from my computer now while I sit at my mother's bedside. I'm really glad that I'd had the foresight to ask for a pen and some paper as soon as I felt that I could write. There's no way I would have still been able to remember so clearly what had happened while I was dead without the notes I took.\n\nMy mother and I were both so lucky, considering all that transpired. I'd had a fight with her that evening and, when I couldn’t take it anymore, had stormed out of the apartment complex to get some air. She stayed up all night waiting for me to come home, but fell asleep. When I came back, the complex was on fire. I'd tried to force my way in to get my mother out. I remember screaming for her, choking over my words in the smoke, then dragging her past the blazing sections of carpet and splintering beams. At some point, something heavy fell on me and I passed out.\n\nI've apologized to my mother now and she has done the same to me. Thankfully, we've made up. I'm glad that we're alive, and I'm glad that I got back there in time to help her at least a little before the fire overwhelmed me.\n\nI'm... not really sure if God exists. I've wondered about that for much of my life, and I've alternated between tentative belief and disbelief throughout. Even if there is a God, I'm not certain if that is who the man was. I'm grateful to him, though. Whoever he was. He saved us.\n\n[He gave us a second chance.](https://youtube.com/@nexiah)",

        "text": "DISCLAIMER: I wish to start off by mentioning that this is not a fictional story. I am beyond honest with everything that I am about to say.\n\n\nMy long-distance relationship boyfriend visited me for the Christmas holidays. We hit the gym for a couple of hours, after which we went home to get a nice rest after such a tiring day. It was around 10 PM when we got home, and after we ate the delicious dinner that my father prepared, we went straight to bed. It must've been at least 11 PM when we fell asleep. I recall having a nightmare, I'm not exactly sure what it was about, but I woke up a couple of times during the night. This is not something out of the ordinary for me, since I've been having problems with my sleeping schedule. After a few times of waking up out of nowhere, I took a glass of water (it was near the TV). I checked the time: it was 2:40 AM. My boyfriend woke up, considering I'm not a very quiet person and I might've woken him up while taking the glass. My boyfriend is the type of person that can't stay in a room for more than 2 hours without opening a window, unless he's asleep. But since he wasn't, he stood up and approached the window that was right in front of the bed, to get some fresh air. He came back in bed and fell asleep shortly after. Unlike him, I couldn't fall asleep, so I scrolled a bit through my phone, hoping I'd manage to wake up in the morning, since I wanted to fix my sleeping issues and form a better schedule. After about 30 minutes, I closed my phone and went over to my boyfriend that was facing the opposite direction and cuddled him from behind. The window was still open. Normally, I would go and close it. But this time something was holding me back. And that something was the noise I could hear from my very own garden. It sounded exactly like someone or something stepping on leaves. At first, I was not scared. But I just couldn't go and close the window, for no specific reason. I waited and waited, until I heard it again. The same sound of leaves coming from the open window. I was making excuses in my head, such as \"It's probably just the wind. There are trees outside, anyways.\" or \"Maybe it's the cat\" But then I realized: It was winter. There couldn't be any leaves on the ground, especially in any trees. And my cat sleeps inside the house every night when it is cold outside. I could feel my heart beating faster.. And it didn't stop there. I was praying that my boyfriend wouldn't wake up or make any noises, because I didn't want to alarm whoever was outside. I was breathing heavily, as the steps got louder and closer to the window. I hugged my boyfriend tightly, which I assume woke him up, because in the next second, he looked at me with wide eyes, after which I kissed his cheek and he went back to sleep. I didn't tell him anything about the noises I was hearing. He gets scared very easily, and I didn't want him to feel the same way as I did: desperate and scared, frozen in the same position I've been in for the past 15 minutes. What was odd, was the fact that the noises were not constant. They went on for 2-3 seconds and then, they stopped. It was like whoever was there, stopped for a moment to watch us, and then kept walking. I started praying, wishing it would stop, but it didn't. It was a nightmare that wouldn't end, except it was real. I don't know if it was a coincidence, or if God answered my prayers, but my boyfriend stood up and approached the window. I was scared for him, but I didn't say anything, since I didn't want to alarm him. Now, this is a bit embarrassing, or maybe even odd, but my boyfriend tends to pee out of the window, because we don't want to wake my parents up. He avoids using the bathroom for that reason. Now it wasn't any different. He was about to do it, when we suddenly stopped to look around. I told him: \"Hey, baby, it's okay.\". But he didn't say a word. He froze and quickly closed the window. I asked: \"what's wrong?\" but no answer. After he came back in bed, he said in a shaky voice: \"I heard footsteps.\" My heart sank. It wasn't just me, he heard it, too. I didn't know how to react, so I told him \"It's scary, isn't it? I've been hearing it, too for the past 20 minutes.\" but no reply. I took my phone and started writing this story. It is currently 4:12 AM and I plan on going to sleep. My arms hurt from keeping them in the same position for the last 20 minutes, as I've been writing this. I took a glance at the window and I swear I saw a shadowy figure standing in front of it. I don't know what to think or do. Maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me. I'm going to sleep now, I'll update in the morning, if I see or find anything, but I'm definitely never opening my window during the night again.",

        "text": "It was raining, and fog enveloped the city, the evening dew clinging to my flesh like a mangy coat, the city dog I was. Rats scuttled down leaking, rusted pipes, sipping the muddy water from the cracks, and I licked my lips, my stomach growling with anger, and for a moment I was hungry. The temptation was there, reach out with a clawed, hairy hand of mine and pluck it squirming from the wall, alive as I chewed through diseased fur, organ, and bone alike, sucking on the marrow like the world's nastiest lollipop. But I decided to wait. If I ate now, if I let that blood dribble down my cracked and dry lips, I'd be full, and I could not be full. Full meant content. Full meant cozied and fattened up. Like I could lie down and sleep in the dumpster and soak in the garbage juice, and never wake up as the world turned and burned around me. \n\n\nNo. I would not taste flesh. I would let that knot of hunger burn into my blade and let it strike true. \n\n\nI was hungry, and they were *here*. \n\n\nYou could tell who they were by the smoke they left. The stench of mind numbing drugs, lines of cocaine and meth filling the air with a sleepy, drugish haze. You could see it in the way they walked, like the living dead, shambling and screaming as they walked without purpose, searching for something they could not find, chasing an illusion of the past that had gone up in ash and mist. I desire them for they were nothing. No one would even notice they were gone. Yet they walk in a herd, and if you take away one, you take away a supplier, a resource, a means to an end. No, I have to look for those who walk alone, so empty of mind that they will not even scream. \n\n\nWhere are they? \n\n\nWhere is *it*? \n\n\nI see her. She might have been young, she might have been old, it made no difference here, so coated in muck it was all the same. Her skin was yellowed like the worn pages of a book, and her teeth brown like the shit they left on the concrete. What clumps of hair that remained on her shriveled scalp swung like the pendulum, counting down as my watch went *tick, tick, tick*. \n\n\nMidnight. The witching hour. \n\n\nI struck. \n\n\nShe didn't see me as I approached, so consumed on getting the last few specks of powder into that greasy lighter that I was no more than a phantom looking through tinted windows. But I coughed, grinning all the while, baring my crooked, gleaming, fangs. \n\n\nAnd there was finally some light in those murky blue eyes. For that I was glad! Some recognition that someone other than *you* lady exists! Thought for a second I'd have to grab a crowbar and do some troubleshooting on her faulty wiring, but there was some life in her yet! \n\n\nLet's fix that, shall we? \n\n\n\"Good evening madam…\" \n\n\nI did a twirl, putting a little pep in my step as I bowed. \n\n\n\"A pleasure to make your acquaintance! Now tell me, what is a lovely young lady like you doing out on her own tonight?\" \n\n\nYou wouldn't believe how much I wanted to gag when I said young. The things I do to please! \n\n\nAnd wouldn't ya know, she blushed! Looked at me like I was some hot shit ripped right off the clothes line and that wrinkled frown split into a Cheshire grin. She fingered the smoldering wick in her hand, throwing it to the ground and putting it out with her worn leather soles. \n\n\n\"Oh you know. Just enjoying the sights and sounds. Relaxing in this…fine weather we have here.\" \n\n\nBoy, did I *know* alright. \n\n\n\"Sights? Like making friends with the maggots? Tell me, what is your name, lass?\" \n\n\nShe hesitated, but said, \"Carol.\" \n\n\n\"Well Carol, as sweet and clear as the heavenly bells, may I accompany you on this fine night? Trust me, I can show you some real nice places, if you'll have this grandpa as your guide?\" \n\n\nI returned her lopsided smile with an unblinking stare of my own. She didn't notice, I was almost disappointed she didn't. But those sweet little wrinkles lightened up and the years fell back from her face. \n\n\nI almost felt bad for her. I blinked, and the illusion was gone, Carol was Carol once more, not what might have been had life taken a different course, but what life had spat out and run over and left to die, twitching and bloodied. \n\n\n\"I don't have anywhere else to be! Would you have me?\" \n\n\n\"My dear, why wouldn't I!\" \n\n\nAnd she took her arm in mine, and we went on our merry way. \n\n\nIt was such a beautiful night. \n\n\nThe sirens were howling, and the murky clouds obscured what stars might have been twinkling in the night sky. I saw a black cat or two pass our way, yeowling as I peered into their golden amber eyes, hiss making it quite evident that if I got close I better be ready to sew my hand back on. But I avoided those pests, and I didn't even worry about the boys who passed us by, donning leather jackets with greased back hair, playing at being men, thinking one day they'd make it big and leave this city but they'd end up just like me, with that same unquenchable first and I know full well the lengths you'll take to satisfy it. \n\n\nI met their eyes. They looked away. Perhaps they didn't like looking in the mirror. I know I didn't. \n\n\n\"Tell me, have you always lived in the city? We don't often get newcomers you see, at least not anymore. But I know faces well, yet I can't seem to have recalled you. At least not back in the old days, and as you know, those were different times.\" \n\n\nI gave her a side smile and it was all too real. We all knew the ghosts who danced in these streets, and the holes they left when the well dried up. \n\n\nHer eyes glazed over again, but it wasn't because she was numb. I knew that look, looking into a hazy past you'd rather forget. And you've been running from it for so long but it still follows you. \n\n\nYou wonder, has anything changed? \n\n\nI don't think it has. \n\n\n\"Would you be surprised if I said I was raised on a farm? Well I was! Milking the cows, warding off predators with the butt of my shotgun, reinforcing the barbed wire fence and plucking any critter that had the misfortune of getting too close.\" \n\n\nI winced. Every rose had its thorns. \n\n\n\"But despite the blood and the rough and tough lifestyle, I didn't really want that. I read those stories of a country girl leaving her parents and making it out on her own and I thought, I wanted to be that! I wanted to be a shining star and get on that stage and fucking own it, let the world know who I was and I wouldn't give a damn what anybody thought of it. Ain't that silly, huh?\" \n\n\nI grinned and clapped her on the back. Be an actor, slip on that costume and be something you're not, you're preaching to the choir missie and if only you knew! Maybe we weren't so different after all! \n\n\n\"Silly? A little idealistic sure, but silly, I'd never call dreaming a dream silly. That's what dreams are for! You wish on a star and hope the stars return your call.  Growing up is just realizing they never even picked up the phone.\" \n\n\nShe paused at that, looking downward, then up to the empty sky. I led her along, through the ways none walked, where concrete bled into cracked, muddy ground and empty, rotted stumps loomed. \n\n\n\"Wherever are we going?\" \n\n\n\"....Tell me, have you ever dreamt of getting out of this city once you got here?\" \n\n\nThe clouds parted, just a bit, and the blue and red lights of the siren song died down. You could see flowers, even from here. Dulled, wilted, drooping, but life all the less, surviving despite the weeds that tried to eat them up. You fight tooth and nail and somehow, come through on the other side. I would have liked to meet Carol back in those dreaming days, maybe I'd be a different man, maybe we'd have a night to remember and many more to come. \n\n\nAlas, a man can dream, right? \n\n\n\"It was different. The poets were wailing in the streets and the lights of the theater filled up the night. Even if you couldn't afford a ticket you'd sneak in around the back to get a peep through a window and run away cackling as a fat guard waved you away with a baton. I yearned for that voice, the kind of voice that whisked you away to another world and made you believe in it too. That voice could bring about change, that voice could light a fire and I still wondered if I'd ever find my spark.\" \n\n\n\"Did you?\" \n\n\nDid I? \n\n\nShe laughed, and it was funny, in a drink yourself to death sort of way. \n\n\n\"Do I look like I found it?\" \n\n\n\"You look like you traded your spark for a lighter.\" \n\n\nShe punched my shoulder, giggling like a schoolgirl as I spun her around, wrapping my arms around her waist and she batted those batty eyelashes at me and I winked back, and a part of me wished I had a tophat to make the scene complete. \n\n\n\"Your mom taught you to speak to a lady like that?\" \n\n\n\"My ma taught me many things, missus!\" \n\n\nCarol rolled those wide peepers, looking the other way. \n\n\n\"They left while they still could. The money had run dry. A war had come, our boys were sent to the front lines and we were left to keep this country in tip top shape. Nobody had time for art anymore. It was a passtime, a privilege and a luxury, fat to be trimmed. And that little girl became a bitter old hag who hated the world for never even giving her a chance, never trying to listen.\" \n\n\nBut what did the world owe you? \n\n\n\"So she curled up in a ball and withdrew into herself, further and further and further till even the shell that remained rotted away, and all I could do to escape the pain was inflicting even more upon myself so hopefully my body would stop registering it. And here I am now, dancing in the dark like there is no tomorrow.\" \n\n\nYou were more right than you knew, sweet Caroline. Good times never seemed so good. \n\n\nShe brought her leprosus hand to my warm, scarred chest and stroked it as I purred, holding her frail, trembling body close to mine, rubbing the back of her neck. \n\n\n\"So where did you come from, oh so mysterious gentlemen that roamed the night preying on cougars like myself?\" \n\n\nI closed my eyes, and ignored how they were wet. I ignored the warmth of my body flowing into hers and the beating of my own cruel heart. \n\n\n\"Could I tell you a story?\" \n\n\nShe was silent. \n\n\nI led her through a grove of trees, out into a clearing. This might be the only place you could find clear water, might have been the only place in the world for all I cared. The link teemed with fish and mother ducks leading their ducklings through the darkness, away from danger and into the safety of her presence. There was an ache I'd have rather liked to forget as I watched the ducklings play with their momma, who quacked with delight and carefully fed these hungry hungry hippos worms from her beak. We sat down, and I skipped a stone, didn't make it very far but you could see the ripples it made. \n\n\n\"How did you find this place?\" \n\n\nI shrugged, tossing a stale piece of bread from my pocket to the birds. Wasn't much, but it was better than nothing, right? \n\n\n\"Seemed like it'd always been here. The only place you could see the stars in this god forsaken place. Yet no one ever came here besides me, and sometimes I pretended it was my own little fairyland. You're the first one I've brought here, maybe the last.\" \n\n\nShe smiled so sweetly as my chiseled hand met hers, and I sighed contentedly, stomach growling all the while. \n\n\nSoon. You can only dream for so long. \n\n\nI watched our reflections in the water, distorted by the cool breeze that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I saw a man, a beast, and a boy, and they were all the same. \n\n\nAnd I saw the shadows behind him, he that left and the parasite that remained. \n\n\n\"My dear old dad pulled me aside one day, looked at me with a real serious look he only got when there was something he actually cared about. He told me, 'Son, I'm not always gonna be here, so when I'm gone you better be the man of this house and take care of your ma for me.' And he stared me down like I was a rat in a cage and I promised him yes of course, I'd do anything for momma! I was a good boy who loved his mother to the ends of the earth, to hell and back.\" \n\n\nI wrapped my arms around my knees, not looking at Carol as I continued. \n\n\n\"I didn't know what he meant, but he disappeared the next day. Went out for errands and never returned. Back then, I'd assumed something had happened, someone had hurt him, maybe he'd tried to save someone from a burning building! It wouldn't have surprised me, daddy was a hero and you couldn't tell that bright eyed bastard otherwise. So I puffed out my chest and held my head high because real men don't cry.\" \n\n\nTill you realize you don't have any tears left to give. \n\n\n\"But momma, sweet, fragile as a teacup couldn't cook to save her life so I better whip out that cookbook and get learnin' momma was inconsolable. And that sweet as molasses boy for his life couldn't understand why, but give him an A plus plus plus for trying! Pucker up child, don't be so sad, lie and just say *everything was going to be okay, things will turn around somehow*. Hold your trembling mother close and hide all the knives and the pills and wipe every tear away and read her a bedtime story till she falls asleep and even then, better not leave because she might wake up and if she's gone by morning it'll be all your fault and *she's all I had left*.\" \n\n\n\"'Why momma,' he asked, 'He's coming back, isn't he?' Just around the corner, he was just playing hookey from life for a while but eventually he'd remember who we were and we'd matter again and suddenly he'd come back and all is forgiven dear old dad you aren't a deadbeat, you're my *hero*! Come here so I can give you a smooch. And mom would say nothing, the sobbing continued and I just felt worse because she was here, yet she wasn't, and I did was make it worse. I always made it worse.\" \n\n\nCarol's eyes never left mine, the center of her gaze as the moon became my spotlight. Good. This was what I deserved. Maybe if you had a voice like mine Carol you'd get somewhere in this world. Maybe if you stopped feeling sorry about yourself you'd get off your ass and do something about it. \n\n\nDon't turn away from me, women. Don't look away for a second, because I ain't done and you'll know *when I am.* \n\n\n\"Did she think shielding me from the truth would protect me somehow? Did she think I didn't know horseshit when I saw it and I was clinging to a lie to keep my life from falling to bits, but I was already holding it together by a thread and the cracks were starting to show! Did you know I was sinking with you mom? Did you want to drag me down with you cause you couldn't bear to be alone so better to die young than live long enough to grow sick of it? But I didn't question you because I wanted to see your thousand watt smile fill up the room again! I wanted to jump with you on the couch and sing those tunes that played on the radio and sure we couldn't sing a note to save our lives and we'd probably butchered the song but at least we were doing it together, at least we were a family…But a part of you died when he left and you can't dig up a rotting corpse and breath new life in it, can ya?\" \n\n\nCarol wasn't there anymore. She never was. It was always you, you were following me, vying for my love, my affection. You think you can hide from me mother, you think you can disguise your face and give yourself a new name and I won't recognize you by the fruits you bear?! You were backing away now, terror written plan on your disfigured, ugly face, but I yanked you back to me right where you belong before you could get any of those silly ideas about running away. \n\n\n\"So who did you give up on first, yourself or me? I probably shouldn't care huh? The past is in the past and good men, good boys forgive! Good boys don't get angry at their momma because she is puking and shitting and convulsing, and it keeps happening no matter how much you beg her to stop putting that poison in her body. And I found where you hid it and what little drug induced strength you had you used to beat the shit out of me till I looked worse than *you*?\" \n\n\nI giggled. \n\n\n\"In hindsight, that was pretty funny cause we both like two circus freaks, don't we?\" \n\n\nI shrugged and stroked her bulging veins, eyeing those scars from every needle and injection. Wondered if I'd connected the dots I could get a constellation. Probably not. \n\n\nThere were no stars here. \n\n\n\"Till the day came where I was tired. Tired of picking up your mess and tired of my own. I did the one thing I knew how to do, and didn't even feel bad about it, I didn't feel.\" \n\n\nI picked her up and led her to the lake. You really always were such a delicate thing. Were you ever strong once, or did you find your strength by leaching it off of others? Was that light I once saw in you ever your own? \n\n\n\"You begged and screamed and honestly, that was the most life I'd seen in you in a long while. And a part of me didn't want to snuff it out, cause if you died that boy would die with you, but he was on life support and I didn't want him to suffer more than he already had. I told you, it was okay, nothing personal really, but when you remembered how to love me, I'd forgotten how to love you. And I swore to myself that I'd never let another person live who'd wreck a home. Who'd make a child suffer because of their own pain. Who'd make the next hit and high more important than their own family.\" \n\n\nI set down and dipped my toes in my water, cradling mother to my chest. She had gone limp. Maybe she'd finally give up. \n\n\n\"I'd rather be a deadbeat than a deadweight. So for all it's worth, I hope you can move on.\" \n\n\nI waded out into the water, so dark you couldn't see the rocks that nipped your feet, the little scavengers that saw what was dead and picked away at what remained. They were eyeing her, I think, they knew a meal when they smelled it. \n\n\nI dropped her and she struggled, but I held her head down till she stopped, and left her to sink. The last thing I saw of her, seared into my skull, were those sweet honey blue eyes that tasted bitter. And when I was young pa threw me into the pool, because you either hit life running or got behind, and I learned quickly, but you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even if I gave her a chance she'd drown anyways. I just hastened the inevitable. \n\n\nAnd as I turned to go back home. To the city I'd always known, my kingdom and birthright, I could still feel her eyes burrowing into me. Hungry. Not done yet with this game. \n\n\nToo bad, so sad. \n\n\n*\"Don't come back.\"* ",

        "text": "I always new I was gay. I fought against it as hard as I could. See I grew up in a very conservative and religious community. I was always told that anything beside the nuclear family was „abnormal“. In school the teachers told us this and the priest sometimes even prayed in the sermon for the „lost sinners“ that lived such a degenarative lifestyle.\nFor the first 18 years of my life I could succesfully hide it and even had a relationship with a girl for the last two years of highschool. \nAfter I graduated and went to goshen college I thought I could carry on with this life.\nBut than I had my first lecture in religious studies when I saw him. I couldn’t listen to a word my professor said because my eyes were all over this boy. HE LOOKED HEAVENLY. It seemed like he was glowing but this probably were just his beautiful blonde curly hair. They fell on his broad shoulders. At first I could only see him from behind but I didn’t mind that. \nI nearly fainted when he turned around. A participation list was given around. He had the cutest smile I ever saw from another human. His dimples showed when he gave the paper to the girl sitting behind him. \nI knew this was going to be my favorite lecture. \nWhen I arrived in my dorm I masturbated to all the fantasies that I had in my mind. I needed to talk with him to find out if he’s gay. On the next day I saw him in the hallway. He came to my locker. He smiled.\n„Aren’t you in my class for religious studies? I’m Mark.“ \n„He..Hey M..Mark“ I stuttered.\n„Is everything okay with you?“ he responded and laughed. \n„Oh yeah. I just…“ \n„All good dude. I thought maybe we could sit together over the semester and lear…“\n„YES“ I squeezed. \n„Ahh okay. Wanna come to my place tomorrow I will send u a text with my address“ \nMy eyes got big I smiled. „That would be so great“ \nI told him my number and he apologized cuz he had to go to his next class. \nI stood there for another five minutes. I had to be the happiest person on the planet. The next 24 hours went by like a breeze. I was nervous but still couldn’t believe that HE asked ME to hangout. \nAt 8pm I arrived at his place he lived off campus with a girl in a nice loft. \nAfter I got in I asked if she is his girlfriend. \n„Oh no LOL“ \nOkay that was the first good sign. \nWe went into his room and talked for a short while about the class but there wasn’t a lot because we only had one lesson so far which was more about what we would do in the upcoming time so he asked me if I wanted to stay and watch something on Netflix. I happily agreed and we sat down on his couch. \nAfter some time I caught him when he glimpsed towards me and smiled. This goddam smile.\nI needed to make the first move so I put my knee next to his. He pressed his leg towards mine- like he wanted to tell me nonverbally that it’s okay. Then he put his arm on my shoulders and we cuddled. I was screaming inside. „Soooo you’re gay?“ I asked him. \nHis faced turned red. „I think so.“ he replied. \nI bend over and kissed him and got a warm feeling in my stomach. \nAfter this we met nearly every day. This was the best time of my life. We had to hide because we still were in a pretty conservative college but I didn’t mind. \nOn Thanksgiving he asked me what I had planned because he wasn’t going home. I told him he could come with me to my parents house we just had to make sure no one will find out that we are a couple. \n„No problem babe.“ \nSo I called my parents and they were okay with that. \n„At least you don’t bring a girl home than we had to put you in separate rooms we don’t want accidents happen here and another little guest next year“ my father jokingly said. \nIf they knew - I thought. \nSo Thanksgiving came along after a 3 hour drive we arrived. My parents told us they were invited to a dinner party by some friends so we had the next evening for ourselves. \nI was happy that I had a whole night with Mark for myself not knowing what would come. \nAt 4pm my parents left and we went into my room it was upstairs but because I had a big window u could see into it from a certain angel. \nAfter fucking for some time I stood up and looked outside. I screamed. An old friend from my grandparents was standing on the street. Mark stood up and asked me what happened. I pointed outside. “Mr.Donovan saw us”. When he saw us together he looked even more angry than before. He shook his head and went on. \nI panicked. “My life is over. I will be dismissed. My family will never speak to me again” \n“Don’t worry, I will take care of this” Mark said. \nHis words didn’t help me at all. What could you do against this. I was mad at Mark that he wanted to come along. Mad at myself that I was gay. I couldn’t sleep for a second that night. \nOn the next day the day of thanksgiving a big storm was coming not only metaphorically.\nIt rained and thunder joined in eventually. \nStill my parents made sure that before thanksgiving dinner we went to church with the whole family. \nStrange I thought when we arrived. Normally the old dude would normally sit front row. But he wasn’t there. \nThen music started and the priest started his preaching. Mark put his hand on my knee. I gave him the maddest look. Still he didn’t stop. Did he went insane I thought for myself. \nAfter greeting the community the preacher said “Sadly I have to inform you that a beloved Member of our lovely town had died. Mr.Donovan was struck by lightning today on his way to his kids and grandchildren” \nMy eyes got big. What… How…. \nMark bend over and whispered into my ear “I told you I will take care” \nWhat was going on",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zpgnro/my_greatgrandfather_founded_a_town_that_doesnt/)\n\n\\*\\*\n\nI haven’t gotten a single night of good sleep since I opened Uncle Howard’s box. After waking up with raw, bleeding fingers outside of the garage door, I bought cheap but sturdy handcuffs from Party City and started chaining myself to the bedpost in the evening. While I lie there, waiting to slip into another disquieting dream, I can see the journal in my mind’s eye, lying quietly in the box, in the dark.\n\nThis morning, while my wrist ached from trying to free itself in the night and my brow hosted a layer of cold sweat, I sat on the edge of the bed. I was starting to splinter under the weight of the events of the past couple of weeks; I was tired, so *fucking tired*, and the stress was making me question myself, if I truly belonged here – in this house, on this bed. Everything felt wrong, fake, as if I had crossed into a world where I no longer had any agency. I’ve probably never had any anyway.\n\nIn my formative years, I fibbed constantly. Little lies, like adding a half point to my GPA in conversation or buying expensive sneakers during the holiday season to pretend I had gotten normal gifts and not adjustable suspenders (“Hollywood lies, Wyatt! This is the real deal, this is what your great-grandfather would have worn when he was traipsing the Sierra Nevada!”).  \n\nThe fibs eventually became flat-out falsifications, glimpses into my ideal reality: where my father was a father and not a low-functioning alcoholic, where I was going to turn out okay and not just like him. My obsession with normalcy spiraled; I spent weeks filling out cursive workbooks at night in order to scribble convincing notes from my “mother” in my lunches. “I love you! Have an amazing day,” they would read. “Have fun at school!” I’d scoff and make a show of throwing it away. \n\nMuch too early to correct, I started eating away at myself. The guilt gnawed at me, the regret that I couldn’t will my fictions into existence eroded my ambition; the comfort of evading shame from outside judgment won instead of the comfort of self-respect. I brought the habit into my adulthood, too. I tell imaginary stories, conjure surface-level problems to seem relatable, and create comfy characters to fill the gaping hole. I hold opinions that aren’t mine, espouse convictions without conviction. Even before the journal surfaced on my doorstep, I would watch my fiancé sleep and feel a deep, sinking shame, because I was a collection of lies, a bundle of wishes on shooting stars, and she might never know how truly far apart we were. \n\n*But then, where does the journal fit?*\n\nIt seemed fated, a day I had been waiting for, or a destiny unrealized. Perhaps it’s the way out. A path to redemption. \n\n*YES.*\n\n*Keeping it in my garage, hiding it – what if that was the wrong answer?* \n\n*YES.*\n\n*It’s an opportunity for change. To start over and start to write a new narrative, one where I don’t get scared by what I don’t understand. To forge my own fate.* \n\n*YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES*\n\nSteeled with this newfound conviction, I rose from the bed with a strength and purpose I hadn’t felt in a long time. I strolled, almost gliding, to the garage door, passively noticing that it was no longer locked. I wrapped my hand around the knob and pushed, revealing a pitch-black room. It was strangely dark, as if it was nullifying all of the light that tried to spread inside. I reached my hand in to turn the light switch on–\n\nA dry tut emanated from a sinister, raspy voice somewhere in the garage. Part of me expected something like this to happen, but that expectation accomplished nothing in the face of the wave of shivers exploding throughout my body. *I’m going to have my fucking way for once,* I thought. \n\n“Oh yes, Wyatt. You can have your way. YES,” the voice hissed. I jumped. “Because *your* way is *my* way.” A loud, hacking chortle pierced the blackness. \n\n*What does that mean?*\n\nI waited. Silence. I reached my hand further into the dark and cursed the distance the light switch was from the doorway. I strained my arm, stretching it as far as it could go, trying to limit the amount my left half was exposed to the sticky blackness of the garage. My fingers groped for the switch. I’d spent a lot of time in this room, clearing the previous owner’s hoard of antique 1980’s furniture. I knew where the light was, and I never remembered it being this far. In the murky shadow I searched, waiting for the hoarse, unnatural voice to break the silence. \n\n“You don’t think, Wyatt,” the voice jeered. “I do your thinking for you.” \n\n*There it was*. I found it. I fumbled, but finally got a two-finger grip on the switch and pulled it up. \n\nTo my surprise, the light actually turned on. It illuminated a cramped but otherwise undisturbed room, the owner of the voice not visible. I stepped through the threshold and toed, still on edge, to the corner of the garage. Next to a veritable pile of paint cans stood the box, small but teeming with malice, practically pulsating. \n\nI felt a warm breeze hit my ear. It tickled, like a fly had grazed against it. I reached down towards the box, arms extended. My ear twitched again: the same feeling. I froze. I recognized what that breeze was, from years of sleeping next to someone. *It was breathing.* Something outside of my peripheral view was breathing wetly into my ear. I could smell it now – putrid and sour, reeking of rotting meat. \n\n“Why… do you think you came in here?” it gurgled. “It’s because I made you.”\n\n“You didn’t make me do anything,” I squeaked.\n\n“Those thoughts that brought you into this room… WYATT. They are MINE, not yours. I am the one who put them there.”\n\nI felt a long, slender hand run through my hair, sloughing off what I can only assume was chunks of soft, decaying flesh, exposing the bone, which started to scratch my scalp painfully. I groaned in pain.\n\n“Poor Wyatt… No mommy… no daddy,” it shrieked gleefully. “but soooooooo much DOUBT!” The voice erupted into shrill, unhinged giggling. \n\nI felt a cold wetness dribble on my ear. Drool. A drop of blood from my raw scalp plopped on the floor; we were in a standstill. It was waiting for me to do something, say something, and I was afraid of what its response would be. My thoughts whirled with uncontrollable fears, drawing a picture of this invisible monster. In my mind, it was slender and tall, leathery gray shriveled skin with long, rangy appendages and a hunched back, leaning ever closer with beady black eyes and an eerie sharp-toothed grin, flesh caught in its blackened teeth. This image petrified me. There was nothing more terrifying than that. *There was nothing more terrifying than that.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a brief moment where two warring forces in my soul stopped fighting and looked at me. It was a beautiful pause, one where the evil around me ceased to exist; it made sense, it made so much sense in that moment, of course that’s how it was. My facilities slowly returned, and I laughed heartily. Booming, it echoed in the garage, bouncing off the walls and doubling, tripling in magnitude; it didn’t quite sound like me, an edge that I had never noticed twinging my echoing guffaws. *It makes so much sense.* \n\nI sprung into action, leaping over to the pile of paint cans and grabbing one of the thin handles with two hands. I blindly swung the can with my full weight. Right before the climax of the swing, I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I was right, it wasn’t as scary as I imagined. Nowhere close. \n\n*Thunk.* I hit it, hard. The creature, which was at the very least much smaller than I expected it to be, burst into a busy cloud of – what was that, pine needles? – without so much as a whimper. I stood amid the gently falling needles, drinking in my real and symbolic victory, and the fresh aroma of the trees. I got to thinking.\n\nIt makes sense. Every single frightening event that’s happened since the journal came has been just that: scary. Not dangerous, or life-threatening, only taking advantage of my shortcomings, fears, and uncertainty. That realization gave me relief; my intuition had been screaming at me each time I faced those *somethings,* the photograph, the nightmares, the creature in the garage, that I was going to die without any doubt. Maybe that was no longer true.\n\nThere was not much else to do but get to the reason I came to the garage in the first place. I plodded back to the corner where the box lay. I stared at it for a few beats, drunk in its innocence, and briefly lamented the loss of mine. Somberly, I pulled it open. The journal was still there, and I wasted no time anticipating some horrifying event; I flipped the cover and turned to the first page. \n\nThe cursive was hard to make out at first. It was like no handwriting I’d ever seen before – instead of the swirling, uniform script I had studied as a child, the leading and trailing lines of each letter were connected, independent of the word. The As had a closed system circle from the beginning of the letter to the end that looked reminiscent of an at sign. Each other letter was similarly cryptic. I slowly started translating. The first word: *Ahjikz.* It wasn’t English. It wasn’t even a language I recognized. \n\nMy great-grandfather was American, he spoke English, so why was his journal in another tongue? I turned to the next page, to see if it was the same pseudo-language. It was blank. Blank? *What?* I kept flipping through the pages – they were all empty. \n\nI sat, looking at the first page, staring at the psychedelic font, expecting the puzzle pieces to somehow come together and reveal some hidden meaning. I was on the garage floor for a long time, until the lack of sunlight filtering through the cloudy glass in the garage door jerked me from my trance. I took one last hard look at the mystifying passage, trying to will something forward. An answer, perhaps. \n\nSuddenly, the words on the first page started to leak. The ink sunk, cloudy and expanding, slowly taking over the page until the entire sheet of paper was the darkest shade of black. Only one word remained in the very center of the page, one that wasn’t there before, in perfect English cursive. \n\n*Newcomer.*\n\nThe word disappeared, completing the page’s transformation into an empty, striking darkness. It hit me with the same dread as the bottom of the ocean or the depths of a pit would, something unknowable and unescapable. It began pulling at me then; I couldn’t take my eyes off the page, and my hands and arms moved on their own, lifting it closer to my face, closer and closer until I couldn’t see anything but the void, my eyes closed and opened, but saw the same nothingness and among all of this fascinating melancholy I hardly noticed that I was losing consciousness. The tugging didn’t quell, no, I was being led somewhere through the dark, somewhere I wanted to go. And I was about to find out where.",

        "text": "As a kid, I loved and always believed in the tooth fairy, I mean, who doesn't like free cash anyways? Since I was about 8yo I always was mindful of tooth fairy coming at night and always checked constantly if she took my tooth. \n\nWith years passing, my schoolmates kept making fun of me for still believing the existence of the tooth fairy but I never actually listened to them. At school I was the smartest kid with the best grades and because of society, I was considered a nerd and no one is willing to become friends with a nerd...\n\nThat didn't bother me much, all i kept thinking about is my teeth gradually falling because that would make me gain some money. However, there's one particular thing that is still... I don't know what is the most-matching word... Unknown? Clear? Well you get the point.\n\nWhat I mean is, usually my teeths usually fall off when I normally have dinner but the fact is, after it does fall off, as everyone would do, I instantly sprint to my bedroom to put it under my pillow and wait for the tooth fairy to come exchange it but growing up I was curious about how she looked and one night, decided to place cameras.\n\nAs everytime I wait for her to come and exchange it while I'm talking with family in the kitchen (I was sure none of my family was faking to be the tooth fairy because it's impossible that they instantly went to my bedroom and exchanged my tooth even though they were in the kitchen the whole time). I come back into my bedroom and check under the pillow, yeah my tooth is gone and there's cash... But!!! I caught the tooth fairy on tape!\n\nI decide to take my hidden camera and check the recordings. Nothing happened for a few minutes, until I actually saw something move. It's her, I'm sure!!!\n\nThe glance on my eyes suddenly fades... The file for some reason corrupted right when I was about see what she looked like, however... I was kinda able to see what she looked like but she looks nothing like described normally though??? I saw like just 3-4 frames of the video and here what she looked like:\n\nShe looked absolutely nothing like a fairy, she looked made out of wood, she looked like a total tree, had a rather wood-ish texture. I'm quite perplexed because why would something described tiny and generous look like absolute monster.\n\nShocked from what happened I go back to bed and fall asleep. A few months pass by and another tooth falls out. As everytime I put it under my pillow. I went to sleep, fell asleep. The night passes, I'm awake. I wake up and immediately check under my pillow. What the heck?!?!? There's no cash, I grab my tooth, rotate it and actually saw something quite astonishing... My tooth had something written on. It definitely was \"her\" who wrote it.\n\nIt was something in capital letters, I can't remember what it really said, I was 9 at the time and now I'm close to graduating school but I remember it was something like \"DON'T.TRY.AGAIN\" written in a dark red colour. After this one tooth, my teeth never fell out again... I'm still quite confused of what happened...",

        "text": "I was in the school library studying for my finals last month before the break. The library was closing soon but Marge, the librarian, always takes her time, and she lets me stay and keep working. So just like every time before, she did. Most of the lights are turned off automatically at 11:00pm except for the emergency lights. I pulled out my phone and turned on the light. I had gotten way behind on studying for this one with my dad being sick, so I was absorbed in the chemistry text. I didn’t notice that the emergency lights went off this time too. I was in complete darkness with only my phone light. That’s when I heard it: a high-pitched laugh; almost a shriek. I was confused cause Marge is eerily quiet and too used to being in libraries. It was so out of character.  \n\n“Marge?” I look down the stacks toward the front desk. That’s when I realized every single light was off. It was pitch black. “Marge, was that you?” \n\nNothing; dead quiet. My heartbeat started to quicken, and I’ve never packed up my books as fast before. I slung my backpack over my shoulders while fast-walking down the same stacks I looked down earlier.   \n\n“It’s me Charlotte! I’m still here remember!” I yelled, maybe Marge was already leaving the building. But when I broke through the stacks she was nowhere to be found. I run straight for the main door and pull the handle. It’s locked. I cup my hands around my eyes and press myself up against the glass door. Her car is parked outside but she isn’t there. No one else is either.  \n\n“Ha!” The shriek again. I flip around and shine my phone light all around. \n\n“Who’s there?!” Silence meets me again. I whisper under my breath, “Marge, please tell me you're just going crazy.”  \n\n“Charlotte...” The unsettled whisper of my name tickles my ears. I get goosebumps. Then high-pitched, “Don’t you know the library is closed and off limits to students now?” I can’t tell where it’s coming from, it echoes off the walls.  \n\n“Please, I don’t want any trouble, if you could just unlock the door I’ll be on my way.” I listen for any type of movement but can’t hear anything.  \n\n“But that wouldn’t be any fun...” the voice trails off. Then as if she was right upon me, “We’re here for you.” \n\nI scream and my phone drops. She shoves her hand over my mouth to muffle my screams and then all I see next is a dark sheet being pulled over my head.  \n\nWhen I come to, I’m in a room I don’t recognize. It’s so like the library I’ve spent hours of my life in, except the books are old, dusty, and the décor is styled like I’ve time-traveled to a hundred years ago. \n\n“She’s awake.” It’s Marge, I know it. Her voice is soft, quiet, and old. “Finally.” The harsher voice says. \n\n“Marge? What’s happening?” I ask, my voice hoarse. Marge has a sad look in her eye and dodges mine. \n\n“Shh.” A glass of water is held up to my lips. “Here, drink this.”  \n\nI muster out, “Who are you?” But the woman pushes the glass harder against my lips, and I drink, the water cooling my aching throat.  \n\n“Where am I?” I try to sit up but realize my wrists are locked into metal cuffs on this hard, wooden chair. \n\n“Don’t worry, you haven’t left the library.” the woman responds. “You may call me Cecilia, Charlotte. We’re related, you and I, blood sisters by birthright.” \n\n“What? I don’t understand. I don’t even know you.” I stammer. \n\n“You know this place, don’t you?” I’m obviously very confused cause she leans over my chair and gets close to my face. “It knows you.” She stands up and picks up a blood red book from a stand that’s lit by candlelight. “Haven’t you ever wondered where that lure came from? Why you always seek to be in its presence?”  \n\n“I just like to study in the library, most everyone does.” \n\n“But not everyone stays past closing and comes back day in and day out. Don’t lie to yourself, you like it here, feel home here. Don’t you?” \n\n“Sure, I like libraries more than others, but I’ve just always liked libraries. So what?”  \n\nShe looks to Marge and nods off to the right, then takes a step closer to me and opens the blood red book. \n\n“But this one is special, isn’t it?” She stares knives into my eyes like she already knows my answer. \n\nI don’t want to respond but I feel she can read my mind. “Yes.” I whisper.  \n\nI hear creaking behind me and flip around as best I can in this chair. Marge walks over with a long silver dagger in hand. \n\nMy eyes go wide. “What the fuck?! Marge! What are you doing?!” She won’t look at me, just keeps walking closer. “No Marge, please. Please don’t! Please!” I yell and thrash around in the chair to get out of the shackles. \n\n“Calm down.” Cecelia says. Marge hands her the blade and Cecelia takes it. \n\n“What do you mean calm down?! You’re going to kill me!”  \n\nCecelia laughs, this time controlled. “Ah so naïve, just like I was for mine. But so much fire in you. I like it.” \n\nCecelia cuts her hand and barely winces from the pain. She walks toward me, and I fight harder at the shackles. “Get the FUCK away from me!” I yell.  \n\n“Marge?” Cecelia requests kindly. Marge walks around me toward my right hand. I ball it into a fist and grip like my life depended on it, which it does. Marge pulls at my hand to open it, she struggles. \n\n“Just open your hand.” Cecelia demands. “Honestly, this is absurd. I’m not going to kill you.” \n\n“The fuck you won’t!” I’m losing the fight in my grip. \n\n“I didn’t kill myself did I”? Cecelia lifts her bloodied hand.  \n\nFinally, Marge yanks my hand open and holds it flat with both hands. As quick as a flash, Cecelia slices my hand with the bloodied edge of the knife. It feels warm, then pain sets in. I grip my fist together and wince, my toes curl inward. What I didn’t notice was Cecelia placed the handle of the blade into my closing grip. Before I could release the knife, Cecelia slammed Marge’s head down into the blade, right through her eye socket. I screamed bloody murder and let go of the knife. Marge fell to the ground, dead. Cecelia grabbed me from behind and held me. \n\n“Shh.” I still screamed so loud that she held her hand over my mouth again to quiet me. “She chose Charlotte. She chose.” I couldn’t take my eyes off Marge’s lifeless body. “And now you are fully born.” \n\nIt’s hazy after that. The next morning, I woke up in my dorm room as usual, but now with a white bandage over my right hand and black ink on my fingertips. It started flooding back to me, the bizarre night, Marge being murdered, my part in her death, and Cecelia warning me not to tell a soul. Then a soft breeze drifts past me, and a piece of paper falls off my nightstand. I pick it up, the writing is jagged and black like the ink on my fingers. It’s as if I wrote it, but I don’t remember this. I read it aloud to myself: \n\n“You are not yours anymore. Like a loss of your soul, she takes all. I’m sorry. Run!” -Marge \n\nI drop the paper. Goosebumps shiver up my spine and for a moment I want to do what she said, but it disappears just as fast when this desperation from within pulls me to go to the library and I swear I hear a voice say, “Come.” \n\nFeeling like I’m on autopilot, I put on a hoodie and some boots and take off to the library.  \n\nWhen I get there, I notice Marge’s car is gone. I should leave but that desperation comes back, almost painful this time so I pick up my pace and walk inside. Some students pass by, and I’m led up to the front desk where a woman sits at a computer.  \n\n“Finally.” she says, and I know this voice now; I know it very well. \n\nShe turns around, it’s Cecelia. She smiles pleasantly but her eyes say differently. She holds a finger up to her lips. “Shh.” \n\n\\+++++ \n\nSo, if you’re ever in an old library, don’t assume what you see is what you get. There may in fact be something dark lurking just below the surface, waiting to claim its next victim.",

        "text": " She said she was Death herself.  \n\nHer calm confidence didn’t waver for even a second as she said it, nor in the awkward silence that followed. Normally I would call bullshit – easily – but something about her made me doubt my own mind. Then again, maybe I was just a sucker for her striking beauty and did I not have anything to lose either way. (Yay for depression.) \n\nI had felt emotionless for weeks now. \n\nStill, to claim yourself a mythical presence is quite a ballsy move. \n\nI stared at her quietly, already regretting allowing her to join my table, as she let out a chuckle. ‘You’re free to walk away now, love, if that’s what you’d like. You’re not going to die today either way,’ she spoke lightly. ‘But if you do decide to stay, know that most always regret it. I do enjoy the company though.’ \n\nFor a second I had considered doing so. I mean, she must’ve been batshit crazy, right? \n\nBut I stayed put, god knows why. In a way she reminded me of a story I read on a forum once, about someone who decided to die, as Death – a beautiful young woman – was waiting for him.\n\n‘Idiot,’ she laughed, ‘But thank you for staying.’ \n\nShe took a sip of her coffee and we chatted for a while, though she remained just a mysterious &amp; charming as when she sat down. The socially awkward fool that I am, I just tried to make it through the conversation, at the same time trying to figure out if she truly was who she said she was. \n\nUntil she glanced at her watch for the fourth time since we met. ‘Let’s go then. But please just quietly observe.’ With a certain elegance she stood up, only taking her jacket. I still was none the wiser about her. \n\n‘Where are we goi-‘\n\n‘Quiet, I said,’ she replied again, both firm and with a smile. So I did just that, too intrigued not to. \n\nWe had been walking for a few minutes – in complete silence – until she stopped at one of the higher buildings in the city. ‘Wh-‘ I stopped myself, remembering her words, and simply followed her with my eyes as she looked up. I did the same, but saw nothing but the building disappearing into the fog at some point. \n\n‘Luckily they have an elevator,’ she muttered absent-mindedly and walked inside, with me still following her like a lost puppy, probably having too much faith in her telling me I’m not dying today. \n\nAs we made it to the roof, I immediately realised why we were here, seeing the man sitting on the edge. How could she possibly have known if she wasn’t – in fact – Death herself? It was impossible to see him from down below.\n\nNot going to lie, I panicked completely – though I understood his sentiment all too well – and froze. \n\n‘Shoul- Should I call-‘ I barely could squeeze out the words. \n\nShe shook her head, composed as ever. ‘Don’t, please. This is difficult enough as it is,’ she pleaded calmly and took hold of my hand, taking me to the side – further away from him. ‘Look away if you need to. But don’t interfere.’ \n\nI swallowed away the sour taste in my mouth and nodded, as I saw a glimmer of gratitude in her eyes. It didn’t seem wise to go against her either way. \n\n‘I’ll be right back, I just need to go have a chat with Paul over there.’ \n\nThen she walked towards him. I wish I could hear them speak. \n\nI could swear he recognised her, in between the emotions of defeat and fear. He seemed panicked and I thought perhaps… it was a good sign. Perhaps it meant he didn’t want to die. From what I had read, the ones who are sure, have no more fight left in them. It even seemed like he was about to come down, the safe way. \n\nBut then, in the blink of an eye, she pushed him. \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI had been in the police station for hours before they finally spoke to me. Apparently an older woman living in the apartment block across from ours had seen the man being pushed, though not by whom. \n\nSince I was the only one left on the roof, after she simply walked away, they were quick to assume I was involved. \n\nWhen they asked what happened, I told them the truth – every little detail part from one. I assumed they might think I’m mental myself, talking about the Grimm Reaper being a 20-something woman and all. I never was a good liar though, so I wasn’t even going to try. \n\nMaybe them believing I’m an insane person was better than being a murdered, but I still hoped for the best. \n\nI was ready for them to get pissed. They didn’t. They just looked each other in the eye, before once again turning to me. The older ones eyes full of pity. The younger one… frustrated?\n\nThey waited for me to finish, to then slide a sketch in front of me – of her. \n\n‘Is this the woman you described?’ \n\nMy heart skipped a beat. The sketch was of bad quality and not entirely accurate, but it was obvious. ‘Yes, yes. That’s her. I don’t understand-‘ \n\nThe older one of the two men in front of me sighed. ‘What I’m going to tell you, may be upsetting, miss Dabria,’ he started, ‘This isn’t the first time this has happened.’ \n\nAnything they said after that is more like a vague memory. \n\nI threw up the first time when they told me she scoured a depression support forum looking for people on the edge of succumbing to mental illness, starting a conversation with them where she convinced them to choose for the end – even when and where. When they refused, she’d resort to other ways – blackmail, manipulation, and so on. And lastly, simple murder. \n\nOnce she had her eyes on her victim, they were meant to die. Like Death. \n\nI threw up the second time when I realised I watched a man get murdered, and I did nothing to stop it. \n\nI almost did a third time – after which they let me leave - when they kept asking me the same questions, knowing I couldn’t give them any more information simply because… I didn’t know anything. \n\nExcept for one little detail, that I had kept just for me, the last words she spoke to me before she left the scene. \n\n‘See you tomorrow, love. We should do this again.’",

        "text": " \n\n**There is something in the waters near our ancestral home, but no-one believes me.** \n\n**Back when I was eleven, my dad got a letter stating we had inherited a plot of land containing an antique home from the 1700’s near a small riverstream. It had recently belonged to my great uncle who had neither a spouse nor children. I hadn’t heard of the man before but my father told me that near the end of his life, he had become completely isolated, so much so that he didn’t even attend my grandpa’s funeral, his brother’s. All the old man would do was stand outside all day, staring at the shallow water of the river, as if he was looking for something. But not too long ago, he had mysteriously disappeared, without a trace. Some say he drowned, seeing how he spent a majority of the time near the river. But search parties never found a corpse, not near the house nor down the stream. And thus after weeks of searching, he was proclaimed dead by the authorities. The official story states he wandered off in a state of confusion and likely died somewhere in the wild of hypothermia or starvation. But the real truth is that no-one cared, we didn’t even know when exactly he disappeared to begin with. It could’ve been hours, it could’ve been weeks, it could’ve been years. In fact, if it wasn’t for the inheritance note, we might not have known at all.**\n\n**That month my father decided we would go and check out the house to see what we could do with it. We drove for hours, past the safe and secure confines of our home city, through the dark neighboring forests. There weren’t any modern roads leading to the house, so we unexpectedly had to make a big part of the journey on foot, following an unlit overgrown dirt road. I remember it vividly, the big trees looming over us in the dark, their branches and leaves weeping with the wind, warning us of the dangers ahead. Along the road there wasgrass and reeds so high you could get lost in them. Somewhere, even though we were still far removed from the river, I swore I heard the burbling of water, ever so gently, leading the way.**\n\n**Deep in the night, we finally arrived at the house. It was barely visible, decrepit and overgrown. The grass that had, once upon a time been faithfully warded off by former inhabitants, had completely overtaken the area, growing long enough to touch my shoulders. While my parents had a look at the house, me and my older brother explored the area a bit when suddenly we found ourselves at the edge of a river. It was at least 10 steps wide from shore to shore and flowed at a steady pace, yet unlike earlier, it was completely silent. The both of us could swear we saw the water move yet in terms of sound, the river might as well not have been there. Furthermore, when I looked into the river I couldn’t see the bottom. I remembered my dad saying it was extremely shallow, yet it felt like looking into a mirror. The surface of the water was so reflective I could make out even the most miniscule detail on me and my brother’s faces, I could see the full moon in all its splendor, I could even count individual stars. Yet when I looked up, the stars were barely visible and the moon was small and barely noticeable.** \n\n**That’s when my brother said it; there is something in the water.**\n\n**As he stepped forward and his feet touched the river, ripples spread across the surface, yet it didn’t make a sound. A feeling of panic overtook me as the images were distorted by my brother’s disturbance. As if by instinct, my legs gave out and I fell to my knees. My eyes frantically tried to puzzle together the now fragmented reflection, almost desperate to behold them again. My head lowered more and more until my nose almost touched the surface of the river as if pulled closer by some invisible force.**\n\n**A bit further in the water I saw the reflection of my brother, now standing in the middle of the river, his own eyes looking back up at him. His feet were barely submerged, so we knew there couldn’t be anything hiding under the water yet the longer we were staring at that beautiful mirage, the more it seemed like something was there. Something that was hidden behind that intriguing reflection and spying at us, all we had to do was see past the surface of the water. My brother kept muttering; it’s watching us from the waters, there is something in the waters, but I can’t see it.**\n\n**Before he knew it, he lowered his head, lured in by the promise of discovering what was underneath the surface of the water. At that point he was already kneeling in the stream, but he was not wet in the slightest, nor was there a trace of mud on his pants. Then at last, his head disappeared past the reflective barrier, submerged past his neck, deeper than shallow water would ever allow.**\n\n**That was when I felt the urge to submerge my head in the water as well, to see for myself what was there, past the glimmering reflection, at the bottom of the beautiful river. Who is waiting there for me, who is watching me? I had to know. Both wonder and fear overwhelmed my heart as I readied myself to plunge down there.**\n\n**But before I could do so, I was awoken from the trance by my mother pulling me to her side. When I came to my senses I saw my father dash through the river, calling out my brother’s name. They asked me where he had gone, that they had been looking for us for hours. I was confused and turned my head to where my brother had stood in the river.**\n\n**He wasn’t there anymore and when I looked down at the river again, I saw only myself staring back at me.**\n\n**We left the area the same night. My brother was never seen again and it was assumed he wandered off into the wild and died there of hypothermia or starvation. But I knew better, I even warned them. Something was watching us from the depths of that shallow river, something was in the water.**\n\n**But no-one believed me.**\n\n**There was no body for the casket, only a picture, staring at us from behind the protective glass of the photo frame, like a prison keeping his image sealed away forever. During the funeral it almost felt like he was watching me from underneath the surface of the photo, his piercing gaze luring me away from my seat. Even when they buried him, I couldn’t help but shake the feeling he was watching me. At one point I even felt the sudden urge to see what was behind the glass of the picture frame, past the photo. After all, a photo is nothing but a reflection frozen in time and I craved its secret.**\n\n**For years it plagued my mind. Every window I passed, every river I crossed, every mirror I looked into, all I wanted to know was what lay past their reflection. During the day and at night, my mind was plagued by the same question: what was there looking back at me.**\n\n**But I can’t handle it anymore, the pills stopped working and everyone else has moved on. Not me, I have to see what’s there. I can't go another restless night awake in fear, lying in my own sweat.**\n\n**Tonight I will return to the river and I will find the truth there. To whoever reads this, I suggest you do the same. Because you can only be sure something is there when you’ve seen it and only then will you be able to be at peace.**\n\n**Something is watching us from the waters, I swear it.**",

        "text": "Before anyone ask me about it i'll clarify that it's been nearly 6-8 years ago when life really wasn't going well for me but that's another story. At the time i earned what i could by robbing stuff and delivered to gangs in exchange for money,it wasn't the best way to earn a living but i just didn't want a job for whatever reason i had back then,you know,young adult life but let's move for what matters.\n\nAs i got the money after an risky robbery,i was heading for the place that i used to call \"home'\" which was more of a place to sleep and eat,when my crappy old phone ringed and i got a call from one of the gangs i stealed things for,they told me about an nearby school  which supposedly had an hidden safe full of cash within the principal's office,they ordered me to find a way in and steal the money,if i managed to i would recieve half the amount as reward.\n\nThinking that it could be a huge chance to actually earn something i wasted no time in grabbing my mask and some very basic tools and asked about the location. After reaching the place i analysed the surroundings and found my way inside by the campus and started looking for the office as i carefully walked around the vaguely lit hallways,staying in the shadows to make sure i wouldn't be noticed. After a long time searching i saw some signs on the wall which guided to upper classrooms and to my luck the principal's office.\n\nFrom there it was just more walk until i noticed a security guard coming out of the corner with a flashlight,i immediately hid and crawled out of the flashlight's range,those minutes felt like hours until i was fully sure it was safe to go as the guard's footsteps faded away onto the echoing halls,with a small club i managed to knock the guard out to make sure he wouldn't spot me if he passed by again. From there on i managed to find the principal's office and started to look for the supposed money safe but there was nothing,no safe,no hidden money,just loads of paperwork,feeling the loss i decided to head back when i noticed another flashlight and quickly hid behind the desk.\n\nI thought to myself:\n\"HOW?!JUST HOW?!WAS SOMETHING WRONGLY PLANNED?!\"\n\nI was pretty sure there was only one security guard at the building which is the one i knocked out,but then i paid attention to the sounds and the footsteps sounded heavier and tense,curiosity got the best of me so i peeked a little from the side of the desk and caught a glimpse of an tall humanoid being,i couldn't see much besides it's height before i quickly hid again from fear.\n\nThat's when i heard the security guard's voice:\n\n\"This is no place to be at this time,leave the premises now.\"\n\nThey sounded somewhat rusty and muffled but i thought it was because i was covered by the desk and the room that is until i heard the guard's voice again:\n\n\"Who-WHAT ARE YOU?!?!WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!ANSWER ME-\"\n\nAnd then there was what sounded like a giant slice and then silence,i finally gathered courage to look outside,whatever the tall thing was,it was gone and only an fatal wounded security guard remained with a huge slash in his chest,laying at the floor as he kept bleeding,i approached to help,maybe bring him outside and call for 911 but he just told me wjth his last breaths:\n\n\"Young man...just...leave,agh,you st-til have a chance to survive...leave this life of risk behind and...enjoy the best.\"\n\"What about you?i you're still breathing,i'm sure i can take you to help-\"\n\"No...i won't be able to survive any longer...i-i don't know what that is...but it will come for you...please...don't become it's next victim...\"\n\nAnd as he finished that sentence he fell dead on my arms,not even minding that i was a robber,and i really know he was telling me the best option i had,so i got my things and grabbed his baton in case i had to fight back even if it meant death. As i walked to the way i entered i went extra silent and tried not to make a single noise,from time to time i'd hear it's footsteps or his light around the corner so i'd hide.\n\nAs i finally found the way i got in i noticed lights flickering behind me,i knew jt was best not to but again curiosity got to me so i turned my head over my shoulder and saw it,it was indeed humanoid but jt was much taller,it almost reached the ceiling,it only had one arm but instead of an actual arm it had a rusty metal blade and on it's head it was just shining with light from a source i couldn't identify, and it spoke:\n\n\"This is no place to be at this time,leave the premises now.\"\n\nScared as it very slowly made it's way toward me,i closed my eyes to not be blinded and threw the baton at the monster's head and only heard it screeching,i turned to the way out and wasted no time in getting out as i heard it roar in anger,i thought for a moment that it almost latched onto my leg but i got out fast enough and found two police cruisers waiting outside,someone saw me break in and called the cops and they were waiting.\n\nI surrendered as it would be best,i got interrogated regarding the guard's death but they couldn't link what i told them about the creature,they did check the footage and only saw the moment the bright light covered the camera's view and then the dying guard on the floor. After that i was sentenced but all those years in prison was filled with nightmares and trauma from the incident,i got myself clean and managed to restart my life,but i still think that the thing is still residing at that building,waiting for a new guard to be hired or for someone unluck enough to get in.",

        "text": "I was a typical college student, struggling to make ends meet and trying to stay afloat in a sea of student loan debt. My parents had immigrated to the United States from China when I was a child, and like many first-generation immigrants, they had sacrificed so much to give me the opportunity to go to college. But even with their support, I still found myself struggling to keep up with the high cost of tuition and living expenses. I had to work multiple part-time jobs just to get by, and even then, it was a struggle. \n\nBut then, one day, a friend of mine came to me with a proposition. She told me that her aunt was a traditional Chinese matchmaker, and she had a client who was looking for someone to marry a \"ghost bride.\" I had heard of the concept before - it was an old tradition where, when a woman died before getting married, her family would find a man to marry her in death, lifting the shame of being husbandless for eternity. It was a bizarre, almost superstitious idea, and I initially said no, thinking it was silly and that my parents wouldn't be happy about it.\n\n\"Jin, please, just hear her out,\" my friend pleaded. \"She's offering a lot of money. It could really help you out with your tuition and bills.\"\n\nI was torn. The idea of marrying a ghost seemed absurd. But I desperately needed the money. I agreed to meet with the matchmaker. She was an elderly woman with a kind face and a gentle demeanor. She was dressed in a red silk qipao, a traditional Chinese dress, and her graying hair was pulled back into a bun. She greeted me with a warm smile and invited me to sit down.\n\n\"I'm glad you've decided to consider my proposal,\" she said, her voice soft and soothing. \"I understand that this may seem strange to you, but it is an ancient tradition that has been passed down for generations. It is a way to honor the spirit of the deceased and bring peace to her family.\"\n\nI nodded, still feeling a bit skeptical. \"I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of marrying a ghost,\" I admitted.\n\nThe matchmaker nodded sympathetically. \"I understand your hesitation. It can be a difficult concept to wrap your head around. But let me assure you, this is not a real marriage. It is simply a symbolic gesture to honor the deceased and lift the burden of shame from her family. You are not expected to have any physical or emotional connection to the ghost bride.\"\n\nShe reached into her desk and pulled out a check, sliding it across the table towards me. I gasped when I saw the amount. It was more than enough to cover all of my tuition and living expenses for the rest of the year.\n\n\"In return for your help, you will receive this generous sum as a token of appreciation for your role in this tradition,\" the matchmaker said with a twinkle in her eye. \"It is a small price to pay for the opportunity to bring peace and honor to the spirit of the deceased.\"\n\nI stared at the check, my mind racing. The matchmaker’s words were persuasive. Anway, I didn't believe in ghosts, and I figured it would be a quick, easy way to make some much-needed cash. I decided to accept the proposal right there. \n\nThe day of the ceremony had finally arrived. As I stood at the altar, surrounded by the smell of incense and the sound of chanting, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me. The wedding ceremony was taking place in a small, dimly-lit temple, filled with the pictures of the bride's ancestors, all of whom seemed to be staring at me with disapproving glares.\n\nThe bride's family was in attendance, huddled together in the front row. They were a wealthy, traditional Chinese family, and I could tell they weren't thrilled about the idea of their daughter being married off to a stranger. But they had agreed to the arrangement in order to lift the burden of shame from their daughter's ghost, and they were going through with the ceremony with grim determination.\n\nThe priest was an old, wizened man, who looked like he'd seen a thing or two in his time. He was officiating the ceremony with a mixture of reverence and skepticism, as if he wasn't sure whether to take the whole thing seriously or not. The matchmaker was there as well and was probably the only one who looked perfectly at ease.\n\nThe ghost bride was represented by an effigy made of bamboo, adorned with real clothing and fake jewelry. As for me, I was standing at the altar, feeling like I'd made a terrible mistake. I had agreed to this arrangement for the money, but now, as I stood there, about to marry a dead woman I'd never previously met, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd made a deal with the devil. But it was too late and I repeated my vows as instructed. The priest placed the bride’s ancestral tablet inside the effigy to animate her spirit. As the ceremony came to a close, the effigy was fed the wedding feast. In a final, terrifying act, the effigy was burned to be sent to the spirit world.\n\nThe next few days after the wedding were no different than before. If anything, I slept better with the peace of mind that my full year's tuition was accounted for. But the calm didn't last long. One morning, I woke up to find that the objects in my room were in different places than where I left them the night before. At first, I brushed it off as the result of my forgetful mind, but as the days passed, I started to feel a creeping sense of unease. Every night, I was visited in my dreams by a ghostly figure - a bride, dressed in red and translucent as fog. I tried to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the dreams felt too real, too vivid.\n\nI had always thought of ghosts as nothing more than a creation of overactive imaginations and superstitious minds. But as the ghost bride became more and more aggressive, appearing to me in terrifying visions that left me feeling drained and terrified when I woke up, I couldn't help but wonder if there might be something more to it. Maybe it was my guilt and insecurity getting the better of me. After all, I had married a ghost bride for the money. Maybe my subconscious was punishing me for it, I reasoned.\n\nI tried to avoid sleeping as much as possible, but eventually, exhaustion took over and I drifted off into a restless sleep, praying that this time, the ghost bride wouldn't appear in my dreams. But she always did. Every time she visited me in a nightmare, I woke up in a panic, my heart racing and my breath coming in short gasps. I couldn't stay in the room with her, so I ran out onto the balcony, seeking refuge in the cool night air. I stayed out there for hours, staring up at the stars and trying to clear my mind of the terror that the ghost bride’s image had inflicted upon me in my dreams.\n\nThe sleepless nights were taking their toll on me. I was tired all the time, and it was affecting my ability to concentrate in class. I knew I couldn't keep this up forever. Sooner or later, I was going to have to face my fear head on and find a way to banish her from my dreams once and for all. But I didn't know how. I didn't know where to start. All I knew was that I couldn't keep running forever. Eventually, I was going to have to stand my ground and fight back.\n\nBut the ghost bride had other plans.\n\nI was lying in bed one night, my eyes closed as I tried to get some rest. It had been a long, difficult day, and all I wanted to do was escape into the peaceful oblivion of sleep. But just as I was starting to drift off, I felt a sudden chill sweep through the room. My eyes snapped open, and I saw her - the ghost bride, standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nHer pale, translucent skin was stretched tightly over her bones, giving her a gaunt, skeletal appearance. Her red wedding dress was torn and tattered, hanging off her thin frame like cobwebs. And her eyes - oh, her hazel eyes. They were cold and empty, staring right into my soul.\n\nI couldn't move. I was frozen in place, my heart racing in my chest as I stared at the ghost bride. She didn't say anything at first, just stood there, watching me with that empty gaze. But then, she opened her mouth and spoke, her voice a whisper that sent shivers down my spine. \"You should have never married me,\" she said. \"You don't belong to me. You never will.\"\n\nI was terrified. I could feel the fear coursing through my veins, making my hands shake and my heart race. I wanted to run, to escape this nightmare and never look back. But I couldn't. My body wouldn't cooperate. I was trapped, unable to move as the ghost bride stood there, watching me with those cold, empty eyes.\n\nAnd then, she disappeared, melting away into the darkness like a wisp of smoke. I was left alone, trembling and terrified, wondering what this all meant. What did the ghost bride want from me? Why was she haunting me like this? And most importantly, how could I make it stop? I couldn't go on like this, with the ghost bride terrorizing me every night. So, I decided to do some research and try to find a way to exorcise her from my life.\n\nI started by reaching out to a local spiritualist, a woman who claimed to have experience with exorcisms. She listened to my story with a skeptical expression on her face, and then shook her head. \"I'm sorry, but this is beyond my abilities,\" she said. \"You've made a deal with the ancestors, and there's no easy way out of it.\"\n\nI tried other alternatives, seeking out ancient rituals and seeking the advice of traditional healers, but none of them seemed to be able to help me. It was like I was trapped in this nightmare, with no way out.\n\nAs the days went by, her visits became more frequent and I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I tried to ignore her, but it was impossible when she was standing right in front of me, asking me what I liked about her or why I married her. My body shook uncontrollably every time she appeared. Cold sweats drenched my body and my scalp felt red hot as the fear took over. Paranoia and anxiety gripped me as I struggled to maintain any sense of normalcy. I lashed out at those around me, snapping at friends for no reason. I became isolated and distant, trapped in this cycle of fear and desperation.\n\nI was on the brink of losing my mind completely. I couldn't sleep, eat, or function properly. I was trapped in this endless cycle of terror, and I could only hope that somehow, I'd find a way to escape the ghost's grasp and return to a normal life.\n\n\\---------  \n\n\nI was at my wit's end, desperate for a way out. And then, one day, I stumbled upon an old, dusty tome in the library, filled with ancient rituals and spells. I wasn't sure if it would work, but I was willing to try anything at this point.\n\nAs I started to read through the book, I realized that many of the rituals were designed to appease the spirits, rather than banish them. And that's when I got an idea. Maybe, instead of trying to exorcise the ghost bride, I could try to appease her, to find a way to make her happy.\n\nI spent the next few days researching the ghost bride's family and their customs, trying to find a way to honor her and show her respect. I discovered that they were a traditional Chinese family, and that they placed a great emphasis on ancestor worship and the importance of maintaining harmony in the family. \n\nWith this information in mind, I set to work preparing a series of offerings and prayers that I hoped would appease the ghost bride. I started by setting up a small altar in my room, placing a photograph of the ghost bride in a prominent position. Then, I gathered some of her favorite foods – pineapples and mangoes – and drinks and placed them on the altar as offerings.\n\nNext, I lit some incense and recited a series of prayers, asking the ancestors to accept my offerings and to bless the ghost bride with peace and happiness. As I spoke the words, I could feel the ghost bride's presence in the room, watching me with those cold, empty eyes. But instead of feeling terrified, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. The ghost bride's presence slowly faded.  \n\n\nI was exhausted but exhilarated, and as I collapsed into bed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment wash over me. I'd found a way to appease the ghost bride.\n\nAs the days went by, I started to feel a sense of hope and optimism that I hadn't felt in a long time. The ghost bride's haunting had become infrequent, and I felt like I was making progress in finding a way to live peacefully with her.\n\nAnd then, something else happened that started to brighten my days. I met a woman, and we hit it off right away. Her name was Mia, and she was smart, funny, and had beautiful brown eyes. We met in one of my classes at college. We found ourselves sitting next to each other in a seminar on Chinese folklore. We bonded over our shared fascination with Eastern mythology. We started spending more and more time together, and before I knew it, I found myself falling for her.\n\nBut there was one big problem. I couldn't tell Mia about the ghost bride. I was embarrassed and ashamed of what I'd done for money, and I was afraid she'd judge me if she found out. So, I started making excuses to avoid having her visit my apartment. I told her I had a roommate who was always home, or that I was a neat freak and I didn't want her to see the mess I'd made.  \n\n\nMia was understanding, but I could tell she was starting to get a little suspicious. I felt guilty for keeping this secret from her, but I just didn't know how to tell her the truth.\n\nI was stuck in this predicament, torn between my feelings for Mia and my fear of what would happen if I told her the truth. I knew I needed to find a way to come clean, but I wasn't sure how to do it without risking everything. Every time I thought about introducing her to my ghost bride saga, my stomach would twist into knots. In the end, my fear won out, and I kept my secret hidden from her, hoping that somehow everything would work out in the end.\n\nOver time, the ghost bride's haunting had almost stopped, and I made progress in my relationship with Mia. I felt ready to move on to a new life with Mia. \n\nBut just when I thought things were starting to look up, everything fell apart.\n\nIt started with a series of strange events that could only be attributed to the ghost bride. Things went missing from my apartment, and I started to feel like I was being watched. And then, one night, the ghost bride decided to visit me again. I was in bed, trying to get some rest, when I felt a cold gust of wind sweep through my room. I opened my eyes and saw the ghost bride standing at the foot of my bed, her pale, translucent form barely visible in the darkness.\n\nShe didn't say anything at first, just stared at me with those cold, empty eyes. But then, she opened her mouth and spoke, her voice a whisper that sent shivers down my spine. \"You thought you could escape me,\" she said. \"But you were wrong. You will never be free of me.\"\n\nI could sense a new jealousy and anger in her voice, and I realized that she was upset about my relationship with Mia. \"You shouldn't be with her,\" the ghost bride said. \"You belong to me. You always will.\"\n\nI had reached the end of my rope. I didn't know how much longer I could go on like this, with the ghost bride haunting me and threatening to tear apart my relationship with Mia. I was starting to think the only way to put an end to this nightmare was to leave everything behind and start over. I knew I had to also come clean to Mia and tell her everything. It was the only way to move on and start a new life together.\n\n\"Mia,\" I said, my voice shaking as I finally gathered the courage to confess. \"There's something I need to tell you. I've been keeping a secret from you, and I'm sorry. I married a ghost bride for the money, and I've been haunted by her ever since.\" I went on to tell her everything about my wedding with the ghost bride and my life since then.\n\nMia's eyes widened in shock, but to my surprise, she didn't pull away from me. \"Jin, that's a lot to take in,\" she said, taking my hand in hers. \"But I'm here for you. We'll figure out a way to deal with this together.\"\n\nI felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. With Mia by my side, I felt like I could find a way to put an end to this haunting once and for all.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" I said, my voice steady now. \"I think we should leave town and start over somewhere new. It's the only way we can escape the past and move on.\"\n\nTo my surprise, Mia was onboard. She had been feeling suffocated and trapped in her old life, and she was ready for a change too. We talked about our dreams and our plans for the future, and we felt like we were on the cusp of something special. We decided to sell everything we owned and set off on a road trip, determined to leave the past behind and start anew.\n\n\\---------\n\nAs we drove through the darkness, Mia by my side, leisurely munching on some fruit, we experienced a sense of freedom and possibility that had eluded us for quite some time.\n\nBut then, just when I thought everything was falling into place, my phone rang. It was the police, and they were telling me that there had been a break-in at Mia's house. \"We've found a body, and we need you to come down to the station to identify it. A neighbor gave us your phone number.\"\n\nI was in shock as I listened to the police officer's voice on the other end of the line. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A break-in? A body? Whose body? It didn't make any sense. I was there just an hour ago. I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nI had no idea what I was going to find when I got there. I turned to Mia, trying to gauge her reaction, but something was off. Her eyes looked different, almost hazel, and the warmth on her face was replaced by a cold, expressionless look. She put her bag of sliced pineapples down and took my phone from my hands and turned it off. Then, she looked at me and smiled.",

        "text": "\"Who are you?\"\n\nI heard the alarm in Yohannes' greeting downstairs and assumed he was on the phone until the shrieking reply.\n\n\"Yohannes! Oh my god, I can't believe I found you!\"\n\n\"What are you doing in my house?\"\n\nThis was the practiced, firm assertiveness we had learned to use with people who broke past our boundaries.\n\nI ran downstairs.\n\nShe was wearing this year’s tie dye hoodie emblazoned with our ship name, Yoston. She was petite and couldn't have been older than sixteen. I was a bit relieved. Yes it was a crazy person because she had clearly broken in, but she was just a young girl. A TikTok follower. Someone we would have liked meeting in a circumstance that was actually appropriate.\n\nHer face lit up at the sight of me. \"Oh my god, Easton!” She rushed toward me, her arms outstretched.\n\nYohannes stepped in her way and put both hands up to her in a firm stance, blocking her from advancing toward me. \"Do not try to hug him. I understand that you wanted to meet us, and we appreciate that you supported our relationship, but it’s not okay that you just came in here. How did you get in our house?\"\n\nShe looked at us both. A dawning appeared in her eyes. \"Oh no! I'm not like, a stalker, I promise. I'm a normal person. I looked at a bunch of your posts and figured out that you lived here, and I just really had to talk to you so I got in through the window which I know sounds like a lot but you have to hear me out. I love you two, and you can't break up. I mean, I know you literally just did, but you can't. You're too good together to give up on each other. You said you'd never do that. And what about all of us, what about all the fans who need you?\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked.\n\n\"Christina.\"\n\n\"Christina,\" I said, speaking calmly. \"You need to go home, so we're going to call the police to come help you and make sure you get home safe.\" It sounded dumb but I was hoping my phrasing and whatever parasocial relationship she saw us as having with her would lull her. My phone was upstairs, so I said to Yohannes, \"Baby, please do that for her right now?\"\n\nThe accidental term of endearment brought a flush feeling to my face as soon as I said it. I would have to learn to break the habit while we newly figured out where to go from here. I could spend time cringing myself into the sun later. Right now I needed focus. Yohannes would probably agree that we weren’t going to press charges. We just needed her and anyone else who might try this to know it was not going to be rewarded.\n\nShe looked stunned. \"I've supported you this *whole time*! Why would you call the police on literally your biggest fan?\" \n\nShe ran into the adjacent room. \n\nWe followed her into the kitchen. I wasn't even fully sure what we thought we would do to stop her, because even though she was the one who broke into our house, she was still a young girl and we were two grown men, so we couldn't just put our hands on her, right?\n\nShe went directly to the knife drawer, opened it, and pulled out the butcher’s knife. She stepped toward the kitchen entrance, sealing off our only exit.\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nWe both backed toward the cabinets on the opposite end.\n\nYohannes spoke firmly but more gently than before. “Christina, put the knife down.”\n\nShe shook her head, tears welling in her eyes.\n\nShe'd known not just where the kitchen was, but exactly where to grab the knife. Yes, we’d shown our house and posted cooking videos, but there was something intense and unexpected about someone memorizing the layout.\n\nI tried to step in front of Yohannes to protect him and ended up almost tripping over him when he did the same.\n\nChristina looked at us both with a tearfully fond head tilt. \"Look at you two right now. You're magic. This is why you guys are literally the most adorable couple ever. You're not even on camera and you're just like this in real life. \" She pulled out her phone and aimed it at us. \"I know I lost the moment but do you think you could do something else cute? So I can prove to my friends I met you?\"\n\nWe looked at each other, realizing that as much as we didn’t want to perform in this girl’s circus, it could buy us time if we tried to distract her. Yohannes put his hand at my waist to pull me close to him. He leaned into my ear and whispered, \"I dialed the police and they're on the line. Let's hope they can put the pieces together and show up as soon as possible. In the meantime, let’s just try to talk to her.\"\n\nI nodded, relieved. \n\nHe took my hand and gave it a comforting squeeze. He continued, “I know this is crazy but it’s also so stupid and someday we’ll laugh about it.”\n\nThis time I could see he was the one cringing inside. Over the suggestion that we would do anything together someday.\n\nI don't really cry often, but I found myself blinking back tears.\n\n\"Oh no, Easton. Why are you crying?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Because I'm tired,\" I said. \"I'm tired of feeling like a character that other people animate in their minds. I'm tired from what it felt like for three years to hold my boyfriend's hand and feel guilty whenever I didn't 'capture the moment' with a fucking camera.\"\n\nShe put her phone down, chastised.\n\n\"And I'm tired because all I wanted to ever do is love him and that failed, and now there's someone in our house, you, and you're threatening us with a knife over it.\"\n\nChristina's jaw opened. \"WHAT? You think I'm *threatening you*?\"\n\nYohannes said, \"Yeah. What else is this?\" \n\nShe didn't put the knife down, but she lowered it, to my relief. \"I would never ever hurt you. You're both so pretty. Sorry, I mean, you're also so nice and such amazing people. I would never hurt you.\"\n\n\"Okay thanks, that's great,\" Yohannes said. \"So that means you can put the knife down.\"\n\n\"Are you going to get back together?\"\n\nShe could see the answer in our faces.\n\n\"You made me believe in love,\" she said tearfully. \"But now I know that people can just... stop. Anyone can, at any time. I don't want to live knowing that.\"\n\nShe turned the knife on herself. \n\nThe second she started falling forward, we shouted no, we rushed to stop her. She hit the ground. The blade came through the other side of her, through the avatars of our faces on the back of the hoodie.\n\nI collapsed beside her. She was still breathing, making stilted jolts of movement. I saw the blood already pooling before Yohannes turned my face and pulled me away.\n\nI don't know how long it took the police and EMT to arrive. Maybe another minute. Maybe twenty. I was in a haze as Yohannes sat on the floor with me, next to the girl, shaking as he tried to explain things to the emergency line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see her outstretched arms every time I descend the stairs. Every meal I make, I see her body on the floor. Every noise I hear from outside, I dread that it’s another child who has come to die in my house.\n\nEveryone heard what had happened. The discourse was more than we could read in a lifetime. A lot of people in the public eye, friends and strangers to us alike, quietly stopped posting their relationships.\n\nTonight, Yohannes held me, his body spooned up with mine in bed. His arm was wrapped around me and I kissed his fingertips. I got out of bed in hopes that writing and sharing this might calm me enough to sleep some.\n\nI know our relationship is running on trauma, that this is what had brought us back together. Neither of us can go to sleep now without someone to hold us through our nightmares. \n\nWe’re going to try, and I know that this time it’s different. We might work out or we might not. But either way, there won’t be a camera in sight.",

        "text": "Hello. I would like to begin this post by saying, if you are seeing this, please contact some kind of help service. We need help. Please. As you can probably tell from the title of this post, it all started with a lunch time club at my school. That my friends and I would attend as a joke. We found it amusing, and it wasn't harming anyone, right? Turns out we were wrong. So, so wrong. I still remember the last time I saw everyone. It was another school day, and a friend reminded us after 4th period and at lunch that the club was on once again. We all chuckled, a great source of entertainment as lunches on days that didn't have the club running were boring to the point of insanity. We elbowed eachother as we walked down the corridor towards the door. \"Here we go again\" I laughed as we pushed open the door. Kpop music began filling our heads and blasting into our ear drums. People squealing over their biases whenever they happened to appear on the screen. My friends and I sat in the corner, and began talking, when suddenly, a randomly amusing dance move motioned on screen. I laughed -maybe a bit too loud now that I think about it- and everyone turned their head towards my friends and I, with the same emotionless expression and cold eyes. Weird, I thought, so I just looked at my lap, uncomfortable with all these eyes in my direction. When I looked up again, there was the teacher running the club, holding a chair. \"Uh, yes miss?\" My friend muttered, and before anyone one else could speak, I felt the chair make contact with my head, and as I blacked out, I felt all the eyes staring at me. What have I done? All I did was laugh.. Right?\n\n\n\nThat leads us to where we are now. I'm stuck in the classroom. I cant escape. When I awoke, the first thing I felt was an immense sense of dread, later followed by a shooting pain in head that rippled all the way down my neck. As I stood up slowly, holding my head in my hand, I realised everyone was still in the classroom. Except the people I arrived with. Where were they? Why didn't anyone help me when the teacher hit me over the head with a goddamn chair of all things? Why on earth did she hit me in the first place? I picked up my bag, which felt 5 times heavier with the added pain that had made its way to my shoulders, and left the classroom, only to reenter it again? What? Why am I back in my seat? Didn't I just leave like, 2 seconds ago? Ugh. My head must really be damaged or something. I did the same as I did before, pick up bag, walk to door, open door. Only to find the same classroom, full of people staring at me. Unnerving as hell. What the... It took me a few mores attempts before realising that I wasn't going anywhere. I wasn't going to jump out the window, that would be stupid. I'm not gonna risk my life for this bull. I decided to sit and watch tiktok, as I didnt have anything better to do. And this is how I realised how I'm here. The first video on my feed began talking about how people access the backrooms, a fictional area that can be accessed by clipping through dimensions, and that had no exit. Wait, no exit? What if, I was trapped in some kind of backroom? No, my head is just messing with me, it hurts after all. But later on in the video, the person commentating began talking about monsters that can be found there, followed by a barrage of horrifying images. And then they played an audio file recorded by someone claiming to have escaped the backrooms. The most chilling sound I have ever heard. But it was obviously fake, right? Theres no exit in the backrooms! Ha! It was a load of crap! I smiled to myself, until I heard the same chilling noise again, but not from my phone. It was.. coming from behind me..",

        "text": "  \n\n**Don’t Look Behind You**\n\nI was slightly weary to go down. I knew it was the Lost Town because of how similar it was to my own. It wasn’t identical, as there was one key difference. It was a better place. Sure, the layout was the same, and everything looked similar, but everything had been improved upon. The roads had no cracks or holes, and the overgrowth was well kept. There were no nettles. It was cleanly cut grass with flowers growing from it. White daisies flooded my view as I walked along the empty road. The houses were almost identical to our own, only painted better. Although none of the houses *looked* abandoned, they were all completely empty. Beautiful vessels of empty space. I could see the Silent Lake, shimmering in the distance. It looked even prettier than the real one. Real one… was this the real one? Which one came first? The questions filled my head as I wandered the desolate streets. But suddenly I jumped as I felt the same hand on my shoulder as before. Again, I was frozen in place. But then the creature, whatever it was, began to speak.\n\n“Do not turn around,” it spoke in well-constructed Czech. “I do not wish to hurt you.”\n\n“Wh-what are you?” I asked, scared out of my mind.\n\n“I am a resident of this town. I live here, as do many others. They will hide from you, but do not fear them.”\n\n“Why can’t I look at you?”\n\nIt laughed. It was a wretched, deep laugh that has haunted me to this day. “It’s just one of the rules.”\n\n“What rules?”\n\n“They’re why I need to talk to you. We’ll let you stay here for as long as you desire. But in return, you obey our rules. There aren’t many, don’t worry. The first you already know. You do not look at us, you will only see us if you try to. So, don’t worry about accidentally catching a glimpse of us. The second rule; don’t try to come back here,” it said before pausing. In a deeper voice it said, “Ever.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“You only found this place because we let you. You were on the brink of death. We saved you.”\n\n“Oh… okay. Thank you. Sorry for like, running away from you. Your introduction was very creepy.”\n\n“I just wanted to make sure you wouldn’t see my face.”\n\nMy mind imagined what his face could look like. Surely, if he could speak and walk, he was human. “Are you self-conscious?” I asked jokingly.\n\nHe didn’t reply. “There is one last rule.”\n\nI already knew what it was. If this is where all the Returners actually went, then it was clear. “Don’t tell anyone about this place.”\n\n“You’re smart. But yes, do not even think about telling anyone about this town. We will know if you do.”\n\nThe last sentence caused my body to stiffen up. How would they know? I prayed to God that it was just an empty threat.\n\n“God won’t listen to you here,” it said before laughing.\n\n“Wh-what?”\n\n“I told you; we know everything you think. Now go and enjoy yourself. If you ever need anything, anything at all, just shout what you want.”\n\nIt was hard to enjoy myself with the fact that they could hear whatever I was thinking. But I needed to listen to them. The shop. I needed to go there. I walked along the clean streets before finding it. It was, like everything else, a neater copy of the one I knew. I stepped inside, only to find it was packed with food. At the back was a large wall filled entirely with Semtex. Was this heaven? I ran to it and grabbed a can. It was cold but reminded me of home. “How do I pay?”\n\nA voice came from a speaker in the corner of the shop. “You don’t. Anything you want, take. It’ll be restocked the moment you leave the shop.”\n\nThe voice coming from the speaker was different to the man I met. It was more feminine and less intimidating.\n\n“Woah, okay,” I said as I looked back to the can. It was real, this wasn’t a dream. A confused expression fell on my face as I started to think about everything. Before I could even ask, the voice answered my question.\n\n“Because you are our guest. That’s why. We rarely get visitors, so we treat each one with the respect and courtesy that they deserve.”\n\nBefore I even thought about what I was going to say, I blurted out, “Filip was here less than a week ago.”\n\nThe voice fell silent. Static buzzed through the speaker, as if the woman was questioning what she would tell me. “What makes you think that?”\n\n“Well, he’s a Returner,” I said as I threw my can up and caught it again. “At least, he was. He went missing again. He talked about some place. I’m assuming this is the place he mentioned. This *is* the Lost Town, right?”\n\n“Maybe it is. But maybe it isn’t. What has made you believe that this is the town that was lost, rather than the one you came from? Which one shouts the word ‘lost’ at you more? The clean, well-kept town with everything you want, or the decrepit place you call home?”\n\n“Nová Vés isn’t only accessible through a cave at the end of a road. Let alone the writing on the cave entrance.”\n\n“Abandon all hope.”\n\n“Yeah. What does that even mean?”\n\n“We didn’t write it.”\n\n“Why don’t you get rid of it?”\n\n“It’s not part of our town. We can’t.”\n\n“Oh. Well, thanks for the Semtex,” I said as I walked out of the shop. My fingernails were dirty and close to being ripped off, so I dug my fingers deep into the ring of the pull tab and pulled it backwards. The can opened, but I cut my finger on the opening. It was a clean incision, wrapping around most of my finger. I wiped the blood off and took a sip. It was even better than the Semtex at home. At this point, I wasn’t surprised.\n\nI looked around the empty streets, thinking of what to do. The glimmer of the Silent Lake beckoned me towards it. With nothing better to do, I followed my gaze. The town may have been pretty and clean, but it was silent. Deathly silent. Other than my footsteps and the occasional sip of my drink, I couldn’t hear anything. But there was something else that kept bothering me. Every time I turned around, I felt whiplash. Something hiding away in the corner of my eye. Heeding the man’s words carefully, I tried to not look around too often.\n\nThe lake was cleaner than the Silent Lake. The water was clear, and the rocks weren’t jagged. “You guys don’t mind if I go in naked?” I laughed. These people were friendly. I could make jokes.\n\n“Go ahead,” said a voice from the trees. It was different to the past two voices. Maybe there really was a community of these faceless beings.\n\nI stripped down until I was butt naked and took a step into the water. It was perfect. Not too cold, not too warm. It was lighter than the Silent Lake. It felt like the dead sea; I could float no matter what I did. It was pure bliss. I swam deeper in, until I couldn’t touch the floor. I shut my eyes and swam downwards to soak my hair. But then something happened. The water grew cold. Freezing cold. And the light that shone through my eyelids faded out. I opened my eyes quickly to find out what happened.\n\n“What the hell…” I said out loud to myself as I saw where I was. The Lost Town was gone. I couldn’t see any trace of it. I wasn’t in a lake. I wasn’t even naked. I was back at the tree deep in the woods. My throat began itching again. I started to shiver uncontrollably and in curled up in a ball. Was it a dream? Surely not. It was real, I know it was! I know for a fact that everything I experienced was certainly, one hundred percent real. Right?\n\nAs my mind kept clearing up, I began thinking about if it was real or not. It felt real, that’s for sure. But nothing that happened was new. My mind knew about the Lost Town, and it knew the phrase, “Abandon all hope,” from somewhere. Everything that happened was possibly, if not probably, a mere figment of my imagination. If it wasn’t a dream, it was a hallucination. \n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the yellow light of a torch, shining around me. “He’s here!” a voice shouted. I put my hand to my forehead to try see clearer with the light in my eyes.\n\n“What’s going on?” I asked, confused.\n\n“Come here son, you’re safe now,” said the voice. Suddenly, I recognised it. It was a police officer. I can’t remember his name; it’s been years since I’ve even seen him. I stood up and walked towards him, still shivering. He brought me to his car and put me in the back. I saw several others getting in different cars.\n\nHe drove off. “You’re lucky we found you. You were deep in those woods, son. With the cold, you were close to catching hypothermia.”\n\nMy teeth chattered. How was I still cold? I was debating on whether to ask him a question or not. “Sir… have you heard- “\n\nMy sentence was broken by my own voice in my head. It spoke to me as if it had a mind of its own, if that even makes sense. It told me to stop.\n\n“Go on,” the officer said.\n\n“No, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nThe officer looked confused. “Right then. No problem.”\n\nThe car slowed down and I looked out the window. We were home. Looking at my house made me feel warm inside. “Well son, you’re home. Have a good night.”\n\nOne thing that struck me as odd was the lack of questioning. Maybe it was just because of how many kids go missing in our town, but it just felt strange. There was no, “What happened?” or, “Where did you go?”\n\nMy mum opened the door before I even got to it. She hugged me and told me she was so glad I was home. She told me she was getting worried sick about me. But I had only been gone for a couple hours, right?\n\n“Mum, how long was I missing for?”\n\nShe looked at me, puzzled. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I swear I’ve only been gone for a couple hours, a couple more if you include me and the lads hanging out at the Clubhouse.”\n\nShe leaned in and looked even more confused than before. “Are you joking? Oliver, you’ve been missing for three days!”\n\n“Th-three days?!”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“What the hell… nothing makes any sense. How are Martin and Radim doing?”\n\nMy mum smiled sadly. “We can talk about it in the morning.”\n\nI felt strange. Everything that I had believed to happen in a matter of hours had actually been days. My mum didn’t want to talk about my best friends. The police didn’t ask questions. The Lost Town was maybe real. Maybe it wasn’t, I didn’t know.\n\nI needed to know what happened to my best friends. Once I knew that my mum was asleep, I snuck out of the house. In the cold night, I ran as fast as I could to Radim’s house. It was close to mine than Martin’s. I climbed on the bins and jumped up to grab his window ledge. Pulling myself up, I knocked on the window. Radim wasn’t asleep. He was lying in his bed with his eyes wide open. Once he heard the knock, I could see he got scared. He turned around quickly and saw me. He laughed and his eyes widened. I smiled back and told him to open the window. He did it carefully, as to not knock me off. I climbed into his room.\n\n“You’re back!” he said and hugged me.\n\n“Yeah, I know. As something happened to you or Martin? My mum didn’t want to talk about you two for some reason.”\n\nRadim looked at me solemnly. “I thought you would know?”\n\n“Know what?” I asked, beginning to feel scared again.\n\n“You and Martin both went missing that night. Me and Martin ran off together from the party. We looked everywhere for you. Martin thought he saw you run off into the woods, so I decided to check. I came with him, but it got dark. I told him to turn back, but he kept going. It’s my fault that he went missing. I should have stayed with him.”\n\n“It’s not your fault, Radim. It’s not mine either, and neither is it his own. He’s a good friend. It’s a shame that he had to go missing. Do you wanna go look for him tomorrow?”\n\n“I’ve been searching with the police every night since it happened to find you and him. Now that we found you, all we need is to find him. Can I ask something?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“What happened while you were away? Is the Lost Town real?”\n\nI felt a sharp sting in my mind when he mentioned the Lost Town. “Not much to be honest. And I didn’t see the Lost Town, so I don’t think it’s real.”\n\n“Well then, Olly. You should probably go home now. We’ll look for Martin tomorrow.”\n\n“Yeah, you’re right. See you tomorrow.”\n\nI left his house and wandered along the now empty streets. It reminded me greatly of the desolate streets of the Lost Town. I was scared for Martin. I had survived, but something deep down inside me told me he wasn’t so lucky. But there was nothing I could do except wait until the next day.\n\n  \n\n**Martin**\n\nI’m going to keep this chapter short. I don’t like talking about it. But you have to understand exactly what happened to him to truly understand what happened to me.\n\nIt had been four days since I returned. I’d say I found it funny being called a Returner, but with the nature of the situation it was difficult to find anything funny. Any mention of it would bring back the trauma of what happened to Martin. I didn’t go back to school for the next week. However, every day since I came home, Radim and I would go look for Martin. We searched for hours every day but there was not a trace of him anywhere. It was a Friday. It was eleven O’ clock. I was lying on my sofa, watching TV. I was on the local news station, hoping for some sign that Martin was safe. At this point I was only half-paying attention. I found my eyes wandering around the room in a haze, while I thought about what could have happened to my best friend. My dazed state was broken by a news presenter on the television.\n\n“In a tragic turn of events, fifteen-year-old Martin Zima was found dead earlier this afternoon.”\n\nMy stomach dropped as I beard the news. I was speechless. Words can’t describe my bewilderment. But then as the single sentence started to sink into my mind, it hit me like a speeding truck. Martin was dead. My mouth began to droop, and tears started welling in my eyes at an unfathomable rate. I started screaming words that not even I could understand myself. My mother ran downstairs to see what was wrong. But one quick glance at the television told her everything she needed to know. She tried to comfort me, but I couldn’t stop bawling my eyes out. For hours I lay, curled up beside my mum on the sofa, crying. I don’t even know at what point she left. I was too broken to even comprehend anything going on around me.\n\nI can’t imagine the pain that Martin’s family were feeling. I doubt Radim reacted in the same way I did, but he was emotionless for the weeks following the discovery of Martin’s body, nonetheless. In the state I was in, I hadn’t even watched the news for long enough to understand what actually happened. Once I was feeling better (by better I mean not falling to the floor every few seconds), I picked up the remote and pressed the rewind button until I could see the headline appear. I felt sick just watching it. But I had to find out what happened. As I’m sat here, writing this, I have the tapes from that day sitting next to me. I’ll write down the exact statement that the presenter gave.\n\n*It was late last Friday when police arrived at the home of Josef Prazak, who had been hosting a party that night. Several complaints had been given to the police regarding this party. As the police arrived, all the adolescents at the party ran off. This included Oliver Kosina, who was only recently found again. Martin Zima and Oliver Kosina’s best friend, Radim Melcer, remains adamant that he was with Martin after the party. From what he told us, Martin ran back into the woods to look for Oliver.*\n\n*It is believed that following Martin’s return to the woods, he got lost. As night fell and everything went dark, Martin stumbled across the Black Hill Northern Rim Trail. With the lack of vision, Martin was unable to properly see. He is assumed to have fallen into the waterfall and slipped. His impact on the rocks below tragically ended his life on the 10th of September.*\n\n*There will be a memorial for Martin held on the 15th for anyone wishing to commemorate his life.*\n\nAnd that was it. Just as Martin’s life had been cut off short, as had the broadcast. Now, please tell me I’m not crazy. Please tell me that the broadcast felt off. To this day, I struggle to make sense of the uncanniness of it. Martin wasn’t stupid. He was never fuelled by emotion to act out irrationally. He was always thinking straight. It wasn’t like him to go into dangerous situations so rash. But then again, how could I ever understand what someone else was thinking at the time.\n\nWriting everything out feels strange. I can’t describe the feeling of having all my experiences, my feelings, my life, written out through words on a page. Writing this has been hard. But it’s a meaningful footnote. Something to leave behind once I’m gone, for people to read and understand. But most of all, I want Nová Vés burned. I need it to be brought down, before or after I pass away. There’s a lot more of this story yet to be told. But I need a break. My hands are shaking from writing this, and my eyes are closing over. As for now, this is Oliver Kosina signing out.",

        "text": "  \n\n**An Unforgettable Party**\n\nThe week passed uneventfully. Nothing happened, school was boring. Until Friday. Friday rolled around and something felt different. The air was thinner, colder, harsher. The roads were dryer than they had been all week yet somehow, they felt harder. I could hear my feet hitting the concrete with every step. The whole town was so quiet that the streets echoed with footsteps. \n\nAs usual, I met up with Martin on my way to school. He was excited for the party. “You wanna skip?” he asked. We had skipped school before. Being a small town, people would back each other up. Skiving? No, you’re sick.\n\n“On the first week?” I replied.\n\n“Yeah. So what? Fridays are slow as hell,” he said, talking slowly to emphasise his point. “Plus, it’s really dry today. We can go to the Clubhouse and chill.”\n\n“Yeah… no thanks.”\n\nMartin leaned a bit closer and looked around. “I have some ‘divine grass’.”\n\nFinding new and crazier ways to describe marijuana was a tradition within our friend group. I laughed. “Still, no thanks.”\n\n“Suit yourself.”\n\nWe got to school, earlier than usual. The dry roads meant we weren’t constantly slipping into the overgrown grass on either side of the road. There were nettles hidden in the grass, meaning on ‘special occasions’ we would throw people in. For some reason, I miss the sting of the nettles. The sharp pain resonating through my legs where I had been stung always had a soft touch to it. God, what I would give to be in that state of mind again. Nowadays, any pain I experience is purely mental. I’ve gone numb.\n\nMy first class was maths. Contrary to the belief of Radim, I was actually very good at maths. I didn’t like it, though. Does anyone? Algebra was one of the seven sins in our friendship group. The list goes as followed; Wine, ditching, algebra, English, bad music, homework, and most importantly, destroying the Clubhouse. Of course, that last one never actually happened. It was just a precaution. I need to stop losing track of what I’m saying. \n\nI’m not going to bore you with the details of the school day. God knows I’ll lose track of what I was doing, again. After the last period I met up with Martin and Radim at the front gates. I blew into my hands to warm them up.\n\n“So, the party starts at five,” said Radim as he checked his watch. “And it’s still only half three. What are we gonna do until the party?”\n\nI looked at Martin who was already looking at me. “You really want to get high *before* a party?”\n\nWithout even a second glance, he simply said, “Yes.”\n\n“Can’t we at least go to the shop first?” I asked. Now, I need to remind you. Nová Ves was tiny. There were a few shops, but there was only one that we visited. A small corner shop near the church. “I’m dying for a Semtex.”\n\n“Okay, sure. So, the plan is, we go to the shop, we go to the Clubhouse, smoke some green, go to the party. Sounds good?”\n\nRadim shrugged. “Sounds good to me.”\n\nThe thin roads, especially on Fridays, would be lined with kids on their way home from school. You could hear their conversations, and arguments. Radim groaned as he saw one of these lines of kids right outside the shop.\n\n“There’s never this many people,” said Martin, before giving a defeated laugh. “Ah well, who cares?”\n\n“Me,” said Radim and I in unison.\n\nAs we approached the corner shop, we could hear the tinny sound of Latin American muzak from the speakers. There were dozens of teenagers outside, either waiting to get in or waiting for their friends. Radim shoved all the smaller ones, pushing their shoulders sideways to get past. Martin followed suit, sometimes apologising. That’s the funny thing about Martin. He could do the most messed up thing in the world, and make it look like he’s sorry for it. And you would never truly know if he was sincerely apologetic.\n\nI trailed behind the two. Being slightly shorter than both, I fitted better with the people being pushed rather than the people pushing through. Suddenly Radim stopped. Martin bumped into him and looked at me in confusion. I leaned sideways and looked past the others to see what happened. The shop owner, who was doing his usual, had looked up at Radim right as he was shoving a younger kid away. By usual, I mean smoking a cigarette and reading the paper. I held my breath in the dead silence as the shopkeeper stared at Radim. Then he rolled his eyes and looked back down at the paper. I laughed.\n\nThe three of us got into the shop and walked straight to the back. I watched in horror as I saw an older boy take the last red Semtex. “Aw shit, man.”\n\n“What’s up?” asked Martin. I didn’t even need to respond, I just watched as the boy took the drink away. There was a moment of silence before Martin laughed. “Don’t act sad. You knew we were just gonna take some from the back anyways.”\n\nHe was right. We were just going to go to the storage room and grab some while nobody was looking. If we were lucky, we wouldn’t even have to pay.\n\n“Psst, Olly, come here,” whispered Radim from the storage room door. I checked to make sure the shopkeeper was still “busy”. I still don’t know what he loved so much about the local papers. They never had anything interesting, except for the Returners. And I highly doubt a forty-year-old man cared for them. But regardless of what he was reading, he was invested. I took a quick step towards the storage room and met Radim. He was standing before an entire box of red Semtex cans.\n\n“We can’t take them all, there’s too many,” I said.\n\n“We have bags.”\n\nI looked behind me at my black Adidas bag. I looked back and grinned at him. “You’re an idiot.”\n\nI took my bag off and opened it. Radim looked through the door before shoving the entire box in the bag. I felt the weight of the bag all through my arms. I even struggled to put it on my back. I checked to make sure we were safe. Luckily, Martin had our cover. To not seem suspicious, I grabbed a chocolate bar and walked up to the till. There was a queue of about six people. As I waited, I could feel the straps of my bag digging into my shoulders like knives. I finally got to the till and looked at the cashier. She looked back at me. Was she suspicious of me?\n\n“That’ll be ten korunas,” she said. I gave her two tens. “Need anything else?”\n\nI thought about it for a moment. “Nah. Keep the change.”\n\nI left the store, anxious that the woman would notice the odd shape in my bag. I comforted myself by thinking if she would even be allowed to check what it was.\n\n“You ready?” I asked.\n\n“We were waiting for you,” responded Radim dryly. We crossed the road and walked onto the closest street to the Clubhouse.\n\n“Can someone take the bag? It’s too heavy.”\n\nMartin took it off me and handed me his. “Woah, this really is heavy. What do you even have in here?”\n\nI looked at Radim. “You didn’t tell him?”\n\n“Nope, he’ll find out once we get there.”\n\n“What if I take it off and check myself?” \n\n“That would be really gay,” I told him. This was a time where calling another boy homosexual was the peak insult.\n\n“I was only joking. If you don’t want me to see it, then I know it’s gonna be good.”\n\nOnce we got to the Clubhouse, we finally let Martin see the box. “Holy crap. You managed to have all those cans in your bag while walking past security? You know, if they caught you, you’d be so screwed.”\n\n“Well, they didn’t.”\n\nMartin laughed. “Yeah, no shit. Here, I’ll climb the ladder and you can pass me the box.”\n\n“Got it.”\n\nMartin made his way up the ladder and leaned as far as he could out the edge, reaching his hand out. I lifted the box and raised it up until he could reach it. With all his strength, he pulled himself back and set the box down. He then stretched, rather dramatically. Martin and Radim were strong. Very strong. But I was fast and agile. So, I had my own route up to the treehouse.\n\nI jumped straight up with my arms above me, catching a branch perpendicular to me. Still holding on, I swung my legs up to a little hole in the tree and stuck my foot in it. I climbed up a little more until I got to what was pretty much a tightrope. Balancing along, I kept going until I was above the treehouse. I had my own trapdoor which I lifted and jumped down. I landed in an old beanbag we had found while Martin’s house was being renovated.\n\n“Never gets old,” I muttered to myself as I grabbed a Semtex and cracked it open.\n\n“You talking about the drink or your love for men?” asked Martin, clearly having overheard me.\n\n“Either way, I’m definitely not talking about your mum. She’s been aging for years now.”\n\nRadim sucked through his teeth. “Damn, that was uncalled for. You got anything to say to that?” he asked as he looked at Martin.\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Very funny.”\n\nMartin handed Radim a drink and took one for himself. They opened them at the same time. “Did you forget?” Martin asked me with a smile.\n\nI laughed a bit and smirked at him. “Of course I didn’t.” I stood up and took a few steps. \n\nTogether, we shouted, “For the Returners!” and hit our cans together. It was a stupid tradition, but I have fond memories of it. I fell back into the bean bag and took a long sip. The acidic taste burnt my tongue like flaming needles.\n\n“That’s the stuff…” sighed Radim.\n\n“I know, man,” replied Martin. “But you know what would make the situation even better?”\n\n“You already told us you have weed.”\n\n“Oh. I didn’t realise I already told you.”\n\nI laughed. “Give it here then, I wanna try some.”\n\nMartin lifted the bag out of his back pocket along with some joint paper. He carefully rolled a spliff and handed it to me. Radim, who we had long theorised to be secretly an arsonist, took a lighter out. He flicked it on a few times, but there were just sparks. On the third time, a flame ignited. He held it under my joint and let it blaze. I took a long puff and inhaled. A few seconds later I breathed back out. Martin and Radim watched in anticipation. “Well, how is it?”\n\n“It’s good. It’s bloody incredible. Where did you get this?” I asked Martin.\n\n“Stefan.”\n\n“Melcer?” I asked.\n\n“Do you know any other Stefans?”\n\n“No, I guess not. Where did he get it from?”\n\n“His whole family are addicts. His uncle probably grows it.”\n\nI passed the weed along to Martin. He took a puff and passed it along. I took a sip of Semtex and waited for my turn again. The cycle went round a few times, every time I felt more and more like laughing for no reason. I don’t even know how many times I had taken a hit before I finally realised, I was high. My adrenaline was pumping from the energy drink, and my mind was numbing from the weed. The contrast made me feel light-headed, in the good way. I lay down and looked at the roof of the treehouse. I felt like I was floating in a peaceful ocean, letting myself drift away into the unknown. I could even hear the sounds of waves crashing against my face, swooshing in my ears and landing in my mouth. I don’t even know how long I was in this trance.\n\nMy tranquil rest was interrupted by Martin. I looked up at him and saw his eyes were a dull red. “Yo… what if the Lost Town is like… the real town, and we’re the Lost Town.”\n\nRadim stared blankly at him and blinked a few times, mouth hanging open. A few moments later his eyes widened. Slowly, he said, “Oh… shit. That’s crazy.”\n\nLooking through the window, I saw light glimmering off the Silent Lake. Suddenly, I was reminded of the party. “Guys, what time is it?”\n\nMartin checked his wrist, only to see that he didn’t have a watch. He looked at me and shrugged drowsily. Radim looked at his phone for a few seconds, trying to figure out what he was even doing. “Oh. It’s… like thirty past five.”\n\nThe words echoed through my head, which honestly felt hollow, until I could comprehend what he said. “We’re late, yo.”\n\n“You can’t be late to a party, dumbass,” Martin laughed. I could tell that we were all starting to sober up.\n\nAfter five minutes, we were all back to normal and getting ready to leave. I looked at the nearly full box of Semtex. “Should we take it?”\n\n“Nah. If we leave it then we’ll always have it for next time we come. And if someone steals it, who cares. We didn’t pay for it anyway,” Martin replied.\n\nI laughed. Not wanting to wait for the others to get down, I climbed out the trapdoor. The wind hit my face as I tried to keep my balance. Before I knew it, my foot caught on a loose nail, and I tripped. A two-metre drop might not seem like a lot from the bottom, but at the top, it’s a long fall. Luckily, I was able to catch myself on the tree before I fell. With one hand, I was holding onto a thin branch that I could hear snapping. But, because I was hanging, the drop was far shorter. So, I let go and fell to the ground. \n\nThe lads rushed over to help me, presumably after hearing the thud. “Are you alright?” asked Radim.\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine.”\n\n“Well, hurry up then.”\n\nI got up and followed them. The sky was darkening, but we knew the path to the Silent Lake well. The loud bass of speakers was the first thing we heard. Then came the laughing and splashing of water.\n\n“Yeah, I wanna jump in,” said Martin.\n\n“Weren’t you going off about *me* jumping in?” asked Radim defensively.\n\nThe party was big. Bigger than I had imagined. There were more people here than my entire year. The kid must’ve invited the years above and below.\n\n“Nice house,” I commented, as we approached the back end of the house, bordering the lake.\n\n“Of course. It’s the Prazaks’ house,” said Martin.\n\nThe Prazaks were well respected people. They owned a lot of land in the town, and a large part of the lake too. Out of all the rich folk, they were the best. They let anyone swim in their part of the lake, unlike the Dorazils.\n\nWe were welcomed by a drunk boy from the year below ours. “Wassup?” he said drowsily. He raised his hand for a high five. Radim went for it, but the boy pulled his hand away. “Too…” he burped before continuing. “…Slow.”\n\nRadim grabbed the kid’s arm and twisted it behind him. The poor boy fell to the floor. “Too slow,” mocked Radim.\n\nMartin laughed, but I felt bad for him. We walked into the house, and Martin went to get a drink. “I could do with a drink too. You coming?” asked Radim.\n\n“Yeah, I need the toilet though. I’ll meet you by the lake in five.”\n\nI had to push through crowds of drunk teens and spilled cups. Even the stairs were littered with people. I even had to pull a boy and girl apart. Making out on the stairs? People have no shame. I finally got to the toilet and was glad to see it was empty. There was a vent going from the bathroom to the toilet, letting in cool air. I locked the door and unzipped my trousers. If I needed to pee, I could’ve done it anywhere. But I really needed to take a crap. I sat down and was disgusted to find the toilet lid warm and slightly wet. As I stood up to try wipe it, I heard people speaking from the bathroom. The vent made it easy to hear what they were saying.\n\n“I heard Ella’s here,” said the mystery man.\n\n“No way, I’m definitely gonna ask her out,” replied the second mystery man.\n\n“Easy there, Romeo. Her *boyfriend* is here with her.”\n\n“Oh, for God’s sake! Does he follow her everywhere she goes?”\n\n“You do that. And you’re not even her *boyfriend*.”\n\n“Do you have to say ‘boyfriend’ like that?”\n\n“Nah, I don’t need to. But it’s funny. Anyways, if you wanna impress her, you should start fighting him.”\n\n“No way, his friends will join him.”\n\n“If they do, I’ll back you up. The others will too.”\n\nThere was an awkward silence before mystery man two spoke again. “You sure it’ll work?”\n\n“Yeah, of course. Bitches love strong men.”\n\n“You know what? That sounds like a plan and a half. I’m in.”\n\n“That’s the spirit! Knowing them, they’ll probably all be- “\n\n“At the lake.”\n\nI heard the door open and shut. I felt like a creep, listening to their conversation while I was on the toilet. But if their “plan” were to work, everyone would know soon enough anyway.\n\nI finished on the toilet and opened the door. Some kid who looked no older than thirteen was waiting outside. I grinned at him. “I’d give it a minute before going in there.”\n\nBefore he could reply, we heard a commotion from outside. Everyone in the hallway rand down to try see what was happening. Of course, I already knew. But I wanted to check it out for myself. Outside, on the embankment, there was a fight. But it wasn’t between two boys, it was between twenty. I could see a girl trying to break it up from the side-lines. I figured that she was Ella. More and more boys joined in, even some girls were pulling each other’s hair. The noise got louder and louder as more people joined in. Even Radim eventually jumped in. He had no idea why they were fighting, so was his own man, acting like it was as free-for-all. Martin was cheering him on. The drunk kid from earlier who Radim threw to the ground came up behind Martin and shoved him into the fight.\n\nIt was mesmerising. Morbidly fascinating. Horrifyingly intriguing. There was shouting, screaming, blood on the sand, all the while the loud music kept playing. But then everything died down as a kid shouted, “Everybody listen!”\n\nNobody knew what they were listening for, until they heard it. Police sirens. Some neighbour must’ve gotten fed up with all the noise and phoned the local police station. And that’s when everything turned to shit.\n\nEveryone ran. People pushing other people. Boyfriends throwing girlfriends into the water. Kids hiding behind rocks. Shouting. Screaming. It was like the fight but worse. Worse because now *I* was involved. In the hive of people, I couldn’t find Radim or Martin. I couldn’t even find anyone I was remotely connected to. So, I did the only logical thing I knew. I ran deep into the Bohemian Forest, until the darkness swallowed me.\n\n  \n\n**Damp Air in Cold Places**\n\nAs I ran deeper and deeper into the black woods, I kept cutting myself on branches and thorns. There was a piercing ring resonating in my ears like a mosquito swarming my head. The cold night air sent shivers down my spine as I looked around. I was lost. I was scared. I was alone. I stopped to think. The ringing in my ears slowly died down and I began to realise how deathly silent it was. In fact, the only noises I could hear were my own breaths and the pitter-patter of my own blood dropping onto the forest ground. Every step I took was cautious and weary, unsure of what I would find behind every tree. I constantly looked behind me in fear if being followed. I kept feeling like I was being watched, observed by something hidden in the trees. I took my phone out to provide me some light. But it was dying rapidly. The Bohemian Forest is huge, it stretches for dozens of miles in every direction. Growing up here, you learn from a young age that getting lost in the woods is one of the most dangerous things to happen. Not only are there bears and wolves, but there are environmental dangers too. You could starve. And if you die deep in the woods, the chances of your body even being found are slim.\n\n“Martin! Radim! Anybody!” I shouted from the top of my lungs. But there was no response. Not even the fluttering of birds or the shrill shriek of an owl was there to break the disturbing silence surrounding me. Scared and confused, I decided to keep running. Hours passed. My hunger started to grow, and I needed to drink. My throat was scratching. My cuts stung like acid. I didn’t know what time it was, but it was getting dark. The only light was the faint glow of the moon. It cast shadows on the trees, creating monsters in the dark. I was beyond lost. I was constantly thinking back to what I *could* have done. I should have said something about the fight I knew would happen, I should have stayed with my friends, I shouldn’t have run into the abyss. With my legs on the verge of breaking, I sat down at the foot of a tree. I rest my head against it and thought about what could happen. Would I die here?\n\nI could feel my eyes drooping and kept forcing them to stay open. I couldn’t sleep here. But maybe a short rest wouldn’t do any harm. And before I even knew it, I had fallen asleep by the tree.\n\nI woke up to my throat feeling like a desert. I tried salivating and swallowing it, but it was no use. My mouth was too dry to even make a ball of spit. The sun was rising, shining through the trees. I got up to continue walking. I looked around. The forest looked so much friendlier in the light of day, and the trees were shedding, creating a floor of brown leaves that crunched with every step. Birds sang to signify morning. Maybe this place wasn’t as bad as I had been led to believe. I started to hear the slight sound of running water in the distance. I closed my eyes to try understanding where it was coming from. It was straight ahead. I picked up my pace and ran to it. The river was clean, small, clear. I cupped my hands and put them in the cold water. It ran down my chin as I poured it into my mouth. It took a couple of tries before my throat stopped burning. The freezing water made my hands numb, but it was the least of my concerns. I stood up and looked up the river. If it was flowing down to here, then there must be a lake or something at the top. \n\nI walked along the river, careful not to slip into it. The air was uncharacteristically warm. Not hot, but warm. My body wasn’t shivering, and my fingers didn’t feel like they would fall off once the water dried. The air was also cleaner. I could smell sap and dead leaves. It created a faint aroma that I enjoyed. Every breath was deep and purposed so that I could take in the scent of nature.\n\nI saw a clearing up ahead, illuminated by the sun shining through the trees. I ran to it. But it was no clearing. It was a road. A long road stretching from beyond my sight to something that I couldn’t make out. Now, if you live in a forested area, you know that roads are the best thing to find if you’re lost. Roads lead to towns. But this road led to what looked like a cliff. I walked on the side of the road, squinting constantly to try make out the cliff before me. But once I finally saw it, I felt no better. It was a cave. The road... led to a cave. At first the cave looked like it had been mindlessly vandalized, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the town I lived in. But it wasn’t mindless. And vandalism is a strong word considering what it read. As I stepped closer to read the writing, I realised it was a single sentence, repeated over and over again across the entire cliff face. “Abandon all hope.”\n\nI recognised the phrase, but couldn’t remember where I had heard it. It raced through my mind, looking for a home. Where had I heard this phrase? And even more puzzling, why was it written here?\n\nI wanted to turn back and go down the road. But something compelled me to keep going. Whether it was mere curiosity or divine intervention, I’m unsure. But I needed to explore the cave. The air was damp, and the ground was uneven. It felt like the whole place was closing in on me like a cage, tightening and loosening every time I stepped forward. The light behind me grew thinner and thinner until I couldn’t see at all. But I needed to keep exploring. I felt my way around, touching the walls with my hands to make sure I wouldn’t walk straight into them. They were jagged and sharp like the teeth of a shark. Part of me wanted to turn back, walk along the road, and finally end this nightmare. But the other part had a stronger force pushing me to go deeper. Deeper into the depths of hell.\n\nThe walls felt damper every time I touched them, until my fingers were completely wet. The smell was getting stronger, too. It was a grim, fungal smell that blocked my nose. It was cold. A shiver ran down my spine as I heard the shuffling of something else in there with me. I stopped moving entirely and held my breath. I heard it again, louder this time. A slow, purposeful footstep in the dark. The realisation of something else being in here with me made me think about what I was even doing here. I turned back. But in the darkness, I didn’t know where I came from. I went from being lost in the woods, to being lost in a cave. Then I heard the footstep again, and again. It was getting closer to me. My heart started racing and I looked around with quick breaths. Slow breaths. Slow breaths. Slow breaths. I kept repeating it to myself as if it would change anything. Suddenly I felt a cloud of warm air on my neck. My eyes widened and my legs felt like they would buckle. I wanted to run, but my legs were frozen in fear. I felt something on my arm. Sharp, long, bony fingers digging into my shoulder. I don’t know what suddenly started in my body, but I bolted. I cut my face on the wall in front of me. I could hear the creature panting a few metres behind. I felt sick to my stomach. With every turn, I crashed into a wall and injured myself in one way or another. I had been running for at least five minutes before I noticed the creature wasn’t pursuing me anymore. I took one last step forward. Suddenly a blinding lighted appeared from the corner. It burnt my eyes and I was beyond terrified. Once my eyes adjusted, I saw it. An opening into a field.\n\nI sprinted out into the field and looked down. There was a town. And then it hit me. This was the Lost Town. At least, I believed it to be. But I was wrong about what the Lost Town was. This place was different. Very different.",

        "text": "  \n\n**Prologue**\n\nI can’t believe I’m actually doing this. I swore that I would never breathe a word of this to anyone, let alone letting the entire world know. But, assuming you’re not from my cursed hometown, you are probably confused as to what in the hell I’m talking about. Well, let me explain.\n\nMy hometown, which I will not reveal the true name of, is a small town in the south-western region of the Czech Republic, bordering Germany. I’ll be referring to this town as “Nová Ves” from now on, purely for simplicity’s sake. When I call this town small, I mean small. You could walk from one end to the other in under twenty minutes. I wouldn’t call the town run-down, but it wasn’t some luxurious holiday resort either. The roads were cracked and littered with potholes, the only school had about five hundred students, and the shops were no more than concrete blocks with mediocre cooling systems. Very rarely would anyone visit our town, unless they were resting before a hike in the mountains, only dozen miles from it.\n\nDuring the Winter, snow would pile up like ash and block up the roads. Farming would be a hassle and most people stayed indoors. Kids would often play outside, however, and enjoy the white wonderland while it lasted. During the Summer, the tar on the roads would melt, leaving a sticky, black goo that stuck to your shoes while walking. The days would be boiling, and most people would wear very little clothing. Boys my age, myself included, opted to wear no shirts at all. \n\nWith the rarity of people ever moving here from other places, the importance of families was clear. Some surnames had bad reputations, while others were looked up on. Surnames like, “Dorazil” or “Prazak” were seen as implications of power while surnames such as “Melcer” would have been frowned upon. Of course, it was mostly only the older generations that believed in this importance that surnames had. Kids my age didn’t care about these surnames. We rarely had any kids our age, and thus stayed friends with everyone we could.\n\nAll of this must seem irrelevant and mundane to you. But let me assure you, all of this has its role in the story. Now, I will explain to you what makes this town so disturbing. An ever-growing group of kids known as the “Returners.” The name was first coined after the mayor of town (during my childhood we no longer had mayors) stated that the kids who went missing all returned. And he was right. Every once in a while (the time gap was never the same), a kid would go missing for days. After the few days, they would return to the town and act as if nothing had happened. They would downright refuse to talk about what they did while being lost. If local legends are true, people had been going missing like this for over seventy years. It was the local phenomenon. Everyone had their theories on what truly happened while the boys got lost. Some theories made sense, like the one where they fell unconscious due to a chemical leak, or the one where simply nothing happened, and they got lost. The latter was most likely crafted by one of the Returners themselves. But no theory was as interesting (or outlandish) as the Lost Town theory. This “theory”, if you can even call it that, was little more than an urban legend. A myth, even. It suggested that an exact copy of our town existed somewhere in the unending woods, and the Returners found it. They mistook it as their own, and refused to talk about it to anyone in the real town. The story clearly has many unanswered questions. Why does a town like that exist? Why does nobody talk about it? Where did this theory originate? The first two questions I cannot answer. The third, however, has quite an interesting answer. It was first told by a boy named Lukas Janicka. This was no random kid. This was the brother of a Returner. And not just one of the dozens of kids that went missing, Matej Janicka went missing again. This time he never returned. Lukas telling this nonsensical story about his own brother’s disappearance was something most people didn’t brush over lightly. And so, it became its own story. Sometimes kids who told the two stories would have no idea they’re connected.\n\nSo, now you know a brief history of the town and its legends. Now we enter my story, which ties deeply into this history.\n\n  \n\n**September Blues**\n\nI was fifteen at the time. Summer had been great. I had spent every day outside, with my friends. The year was 2009. Only one kid in our neighbourhood had a console, and we went all the time to play on it. But now it was the first day of school again. I sighed as I dragged myself to school. Fain remnants of rain dripped from the eves of houses and into the potholes on the road. Bleak weather lined the sky, leaving trails of grey and white clouds. Fog rolled over the mountains, blocking the view of the forest ahead. I could see the school building over the roofs of houses. It filled me with a sense of dread, and the thought of staying there for six hours made me want to run into the woods and never come back. I laughed to myself as I pictured the Returners being nothing more than kids bored of school. Seemingly drawn to my lifted mood, my friend Martin Zima jumped in front of me. I stumbled backwards, surprised by his sudden appearance. I nearly slipped onto the concrete, but he caught my arm before I fell.\n\n“You should have seen the look on your face!” he said, still laughing maniacally. \n\n“Yeah, yeah. Hilarious,” I replied sternly. “Still can’t believe we’re back in school. Summer went by so fast.”\n\n“I know, right?” he asked rhetorically. There was an awkward silence for a few seconds before he spoke again. “Hey, did you hear about Filip?”\n\nNová Ves was a small town. Everyone knew everyone, and everything everywhere. I knew who Filip was. He had gone missing three days prior. “Uh, yeah. He went missing a few days ago.”\n\n“No, I know. But he just came back. He’s completely normal. So much that I think he’s gonna be with us today in school!”\n\nI sighed and laughed. “Oh, Martin. You’re so naïve.”\n\nI wanted to sound smart. I wanted to make him think that I knew so much about the Returners, even though I knew just as much as everyone else. Unfortunately for me, we saw Filip only a few seconds later, crossing the road. Martin playfully punched me in the shoulder and asked sarcastically, “Who’s that?”\n\nThe two of us got to school just as the bell rang. Not wanting to be late on our first day, we picked up the pace. The hallway was crowded with all the new students. Martin very vocally expressed his distaste for the new students, calling each of them them “a nuisance in every conceivable way.”\n\nMartin went off to his class, and I went to mine. My teacher, Mr Dorazil, was a tall, slender man with glasses and a perky nose. His hair was swept to the side and his expression was cold. “Oliver Kosina. Late,” he said as he ticked a box on his clipboard.\n\n“Bastard,” I muttered under my breath. With my luck, and extreme timing, I happened to mutter this right as the class went silent and the door closed. Of course, Mr Dorazil heard me. Detention on my very first day back in school. I was hoping one of my best friends, Martin or Radim Melcer, had done something as stupid as me. At least that way I wouldn’t have to be in detention alone. But I was.\n\nThe day passed slowly, dragging on like a bowling ball through snow. It never felt any faster. I hated thinking about how this was going to be me life for the next entire year. 6 hours later, the day finally came to a close. Not for me, though. I still had my detention to go to. But before I went, I decided to go to the toilet. Even on the first day, the toilets stank. Cigarette smoke filled the room and the pungent smell of piss stung the back of my tongue. I locked myself in the only cubicle not smeared in human faeces. I had a small flip phone with only a few games. Snake was my favourite. I clicked it and started playing. After a few rounds of Snake, I suddenly realised I had forgot to go to the detention. Checking the time, it became clear that I was twenty minutes late. Before I could open the door, the bathroom door burst open. I couldn’t tell who it was, but they started coughing and vomiting. I tried to peer through the small gap in the door. I scanned the room. But whoever was there was hidden so well that I couldn’t see their face. Then they spoke.\n\n“Leave me alone!”\n\nThe shout was so convincing that I genuinely believed there was someone else in the bathroom with them. But then I heard the same voice, much quieter and deeper this time.\n\n“This is your home. You don’t want to go back *there*. You’re happy here. Here. Here. Here.”\n\nI unlocked the stall door and slammed it to the side, eager to see what was going on. But all I saw… was a little boy sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall. His head was tucked into his knees, and he was crying. It was Filip. Suddenly, my interest in the Returners was back. I had been resurrected into my youth and I ran home, careless of my detention.\n\nI called Martin and Radim to come meet me in “The Clubhouse.” The Clubhouse was a little treehouse that three of us had built about a year prior. We would always go there to smoke cigarettes that Martin stole from his dad. The Clubhouse was in the Bohemian Forest, ten minutes from my house. We met up there at five in the evening.\n\n“What’s up?” asked Radim.\n\n“Filip. I was in the cubicle and then…” I explained. I told them the whole story of what had happened.\n\n“So, what are you trying to say?” asked Martin.\n\n“I think the Lost Town is real. Or something similar at least.”\n\nRadim laughed. “Well, this has been a waste of my time.”\n\nMartin gave me a look that told me he agreed with Radim. “Look, maybe if you had told us this before Summer ended, I would have believed you. It would have been fun to investigate during our days off. But we’re back in school now. There’s no point in trying to do something this time-consuming while we have schoolwork to do.”\n\nRealising my enthusiasm was not shared by my mates. I frowned. “Fine.”\n\nMartin patted me on the back. “It’s alright. Anyways, you coming to the party on Friday?”\n\nI thought about it then remembered. A classmate was throwing a house party and inviting the entire year. “Yeah, I guess. Why not?”\n\n“Good to hear. Let’s just hope Radim doesn’t get as drunk as he did last time.”\n\n“I heard that!” Radim shouted from a few steps away. “And I didn’t get *that* drunk. I was only a tiny bit tipsy. That’s all.”\n\n“You tried to jump off the balcony into the Silent Lake, fully clothes. That’s more than ‘a tiny bit tipsy’.” The Silent Lake was a small lake in the forest. Many houses bordered it due to its beautiful view. Radim laughed without saying anything and left. I walked home with Martin, and we split off before it was even dark.\n\nI got home at quarter past five and lay down in front of the TV. It was one of those big fat televisions with a round screen. I flicked through the channels, trying to find something interesting. Something caught my eye on the news channel. It was our area’s local news station. They were talking about Filip. He had gone missing again. A pit formed in my stomach as I thought about the events that had occurred earlier that day, in the toilets. Was he crazy? Or was something darker at work?\n\nI could hardly eat my dinner. My mind was racing at a hundred miles an hour. Was it all connected? Maybe, just maybe, all of this was real? The Lost Town. I was far too enthusiastic about this. I felt grown-up, investigating the disappearances in my town. But little did I know the true horror that resided in those woods.",

Cooper was the first to reach land followed by Jimmy, then Theo, then Ethan. I was the last to pull up so I arrived a bit late to the conversation that was already being had.\n\n“... his back man, you agreed to come, Jimmy!” Ethan was yelling at Jimmy, who appeared to be in hysterics.\n\n“I wasn’t told there were going to be GIANTS, Ethan!”\n\n“How the hell was he supposed to know that! Even if he mentioned giants, would you have believed him?”\n\n“I…. FUCK MAN! Fuck!”Jimmy kicked the sand on the bank and walked in a circle. “We’ve got four more days to wait out till help comes to pick us up! How are we going to even survive that long?”\n\n“We’ll figure it out. In the meantime let’s–” Cooper, who’s usually one of the calmest people I know, butt in.\n\n“E, how can you not see that we are IMMEASURABLY fucked?” I got out of my boat and made my way over to them. Theo, was hugging his knees and sobbing, sitting a little ways away from the conflict.\n\n“Cooper–” said Ethan. “You gotta chill man. If you don’t chill–”\n\n“ Don’t tell me to CHILL, Ethan! I just watched Goliath tear three people into pieces–” I pointed my gun to the river and fired. Everyone shut up real quick and looked my way. I had their attention, and one less bullet in this magazine.\n\n“We have four days left in these woods. Four days to get to the base of this river or we are absolutely screwed without any chance of survival. Does everyone understand that?” Heads began to nod.\n\n“Ok.” I paused. I needed to think of something or these guys were gonna tear each other's throats out before the giant would ever get a second chance to. “We know something everyone else who died before did not know. We know FOR A FACT that something is out there, looking to kill us–”\n\n“How is that supposed to make us feel better–”\n\n“It isn’t Jimmy, so shut the fuck up please.” He looked to his feet, quiet as a cucumber. “That thing can be injured by bullets, I shot the bastard today. We all have guns… save for Theo, sorry buddy.”\n\n“Oh crap, you’re righ–”\n\n“We can hurt, and possibly kill… whatever it is. And the fact that we know it exists takes away its ability to surprise us…” I looked into the woods. Everyone followed suit. We stared for maybe ten seconds.\n\nNothing, thank God.\n\n“*Theoretically*, it should not be able to surprise us *as easily*. And… that gives us some kind of heads up on the competition.” Theo’s face went pale when he heard the word.\n\n“Head… why… What is it doing with their heads? I mean you guys saw it! The bodies, they all didn’t have heads. It–” he paused and he shook his head. “It ripped off Kyler’s head… it ripped off Sau–” he didn’t finish the sentence. Instead, he began to dry-heave. Ethan put his arm around Theo, and patted his back as he heaved and cried..\n\n*This poor kid,* I thought to myself. He’d watched his best friends get literally ripped apart barely an hour ago.\n\n“We’re gonna get you out of here, Theo,” I said. “We’re all getting out of here.” Jimmy was the first to question my optimism.\n\n“How Frankie? How do you expect us to last the next four days when that THING is after us?” It was a valid question. One I didn’t really have a good answer for. What I did have to offer was honesty.\n\n“We gotta just keep making pace–”\n\n“We’re dead–” said Cooper.\n\n“I’m serious. Our best chance is to keep moving and pray that we can get to the base of the river and avoid it until our ride gets here.” I thought for a second. “Besides, it didn’t attack us BEFORE we got to the valley in Second canyon. Maybe it's trapped there.”\n\n“And maybe it isn’t trapped there, and that’s just the best place to kill people?” asked Theo.\n\n“That’s also a possibility. But now that we know the thing exists, it’s gonna be a lot harder for it to sneak up on us. Especially because we’ll be armed and as ready as we can be.” Looks were exchanged amongst the panickers. Ethan offered some support.\n\n“If we can’t get our shit together, boys, we will be as good as dead. An idea is better than no idea, and being that this is the only option we have, I suggest we stick to the original plan, this time, with our heads on a swivel.” And that was what we did.\n\nWe busted the guns out of our bags and moved them onto our persons.\n\nFood was made.\n\nSmall talk was kept to a minimum.\n\nFor the most part, everyone was on edge and kept to themselves. Around six we realized we’d probably have to stay put for the night and wait to head into Third Canyon in the morning, on account of the setting sun. No one was happy about that. Camp was set up, tents were pitched, and we came to sit around the fire.\n\n“We’re gonna need someone to keep watch tonight.” said Coop after a long bout of silence. Ethan was quick to jump in after him.\n\n“No. We need two folks on watch.”\n\n“Why two?” asked Theo. The answer was pretty simple so I just threw it out.\n\n“Because they can keep each other awake until the next shift.” Ethan nodded at me.\n\n“Exactly.” Silence filled the air after Ethans affirmation. No one wanted to stay up for the first watch. I couldn’t blame them. The day had been an emotionally and physically exhausting endeavor. I volunteered to take the first shift. And in a surprising turn of events, Jimmy said,\n\n“Then I will too.” All of our heads turned to him. “What.”\n\n“No, no … it’s just…” Ethan stammered. “Didn’t see that coming.”\n\n“I’d rather just stay up later and go to bed for a bit before we move again then have to wake up in the middle of the night and wait to ride in a bumpy kayak with no sleep.” Nods were exchanged between the other group members, being that it now made sense.\n\nTheo, Ethan, and Cooper hit the hay, Jimmy and I sat by the fire, facing the woods with our guns in our laps. We’d been close in high school, but over the years, I’d gotten a little closer with his brother than I was with him. When Jimmy met Amanda, she began to occupy more and more of his time. I moved out of the midwest and to the east coast, he had kids, and we began to drift apart. There wasn’t any negativity between us, we were just both… busy.\n\nI was glad he volunteered for the same shift as me because I knew it’d give us a chance to reconnect, and it did.\n\nHe told me about how Molly and Jacob were ten and eight now.\n\nHow Molly had a solo in “Hey Jude” at her last choir concert.\n\nHow Jacob hit a triple in tee ball this season.\n\nHow the kids loved going bowling with him and Ethan.\n\nHow happy he was.\n\nAnd I was happy for him.\n\n“I’m glad I got to see you again, man,\" he said after a brief silence. I smiled at that.\n\n“I’m glad too, Jimbo. I wish the circumstances were different.”\n\n“Me too.” He took a beat and I saw his face drop before he spoke again. “Frankie, I don’t want to die here.” \n\nThose words felt like a knife in my gut. I’d dragged him, and Ethan and Cooper out here. He had a wife and kids at home. And there was a very very good chance that we weren’t going to be able to make it out of Nahanni alive. His fears were one-hundred-percent rational. We could end up dead by the end of the night. We all knew this. Still, I felt I had to offer some kind of hope.\n\n“If we stick together, we won’t.”\n\n“But how can you know that for sure?” His eyes were watering now. I couldn’t bare to look in them any longer. My head dropped.\n\n“I can’t, Jim. I can’t… all I can say is we give ourselves the best chance possible if we do. And we owe it to ourselves to have a fighting chance. I owe it to you guys. You followed me into the fucking wilderness on a whim because I asked you to. I’m gonna try my damndest to get all of us out of here, ok?” My friend didn’t answer me. I looked up to see why that was and… and his eyes.\n\nHis eyes had turned black as the night sky.\n\n“J-Jim?” His response wasn’t a verbal one. It was an action.\n\nHe reached for his gun.\n\n“Jim what the fuck's going on?” He picked it up and pointed it to me. Before I even knew what happened, he squeezed the trigger.\n\nAnd nothing happened. The safety was still on. \n\nHe didn’t realize it was still on. \n\nHe was trying to... shoot me. \n\nI lunged for the gun in his hand, and as I did, he flipped off the safety. He pulled the trigger again as I felt the barrel dig into the outside of my arm. A bullet took a fat chunk out of my arm and I felt pain like I had never felt before. A wail clawed its way out of my throat as I managed to rip the gun out of Jimmy’s grasp. Now up close, I could see how black his eyes had become. It was almost as if there were voids under his corneas. Absolute nothing. I threw his gun toward Theo’s tent and managed to let out the beginning of a “HELP” before Jimmy had his hands around my neck and his knees on my shoulders. He began to slam my head against the sandy ground over and over again and chant in some language I’d never heard of before.\n\n“Pleee–” I managed to squeak out. I couldn’t help but feel like I deserved it as I slowly had the life squeezed out of me. I dragged them here. I killed us all. It’s only fitting that I be the first to go.\n\nAnd then the grip was released. I gasped as the air found its way back into my lungs. I looked up to see Ethan now wrestling with Jimmy.\n\n“What the fuck is wrong with you, Jimmy?!” Ethan got his brother into a triangle hold. Jimmy squirmed and flailed his limbs to no avail.\n\n“He tried to shoot me!” Ethan took his eyes off his brother and looked to me.\n\n“What?!” It was for a second too long, though. Jimmy slammed a closed fist into his brother’s nether regions. He broke free as Ethan, who was in a considerable amount of pain, dropped to his knees, clutching his groin. Jimmy began to beat down on his brother’s face with his fists.\n\n“JIMMY STOP!” I tried to stand, but I stumbled and fell flat on my ass. I was still dizzy from almost losing consciousness. I looked back up just in time to see him bite Ethan’s left ear off. Ethan wailed and screamed as Jimmy spit it out onto the sand, mouth now covered in blood. That’s when he turned his attention back onto me. Jimmy snarled when his eyes met mine. He got on all fours and began to slowly crawl toward me.\n\n“Jimmy…” there was no look of recognition in those black eyes. “Jimmy.”\n\nAnd then he charged me.\n\n “JIMMY!”\n\nHe was ten,\n\nFive,\n\nTwo feet away from me when:\n\nBANG!\n\nBANG!\n\nBANG\n\nJimmy’s chest blew open, sending splats of blood and chunks of rib in all directions as his body fell on top of me. Blood spurted out from the bullet wounds in his torso.\n\nAny possibility of getting an answer as to why he attacked us was as dead as the man I held in my arms. The man I grew up with, who I considered to be my brother. He was dead.\n\nAnd mere minutes before, I was promising him that I’d try my best to get him out of this forest alive.\n\n“JIMMY?!” Ethan screamed, holding the gushing wound on the side of his head. He made his way over to me. I looked over my shoulder to see what exactly killed Jimmy:\n\nIt was Theo, holding the gun I threw towards his tent.\n\nEthan sprinted to Jimmy’s lifeless body and pulled him off of me. He began to sob and caress what remained of his brother.\n\n“What the fuck did you have to shoot him for?!” Ethan screamed as Theo began to stammer.\n\n“I– he– it was trying to kill–”\n\n“It?!?” Rage filled Ethan’s eyes as he continued to cradle Jimmy. “*It* was MY FUCKING BROTHER!” He began to cry again.\n\nI didn’t know how to react to ANY of this. Theo had just murdered Jimmy. Jimmy had just tried to shoot me, and he attacked Ethan.\n\n“He was gonna kill you, Ethan!”\n\n“You don’t know that! You don’t fucking know that, Theo! You just met him last night! You don’t know anything!” Ethan was beside himself. I looked to Theo again and noticed the poor kid had gone and pissed down his leg. He was just as scared as us. He’d faced loss today too. And he tried to do the right thing here.\n\n“E,” I spoke up. “He wasn’t *him* anymore.” Ethan looked to me now.\n\n“What the hell is that supposed to even mean, Frankie?”\n\n“I mean… I.” I looked for the right words to no avail. No matter how I could put it, what I thought to be true was going to sound insane. “Ethan, I think Jimmy was possessed.” He stared me dead in the eyes for what felt like a year.\n\n“Are you out of your Goddamn mind? Possessed?” He took it how I thought he would.\n\n“We were attacked by a Giant not even eight hours ago E, I’ve given up on what I thought I knew was impossible.”\n\n“What would even lead you to think that he was possessed?”\n\n“I don’t know man. Besides him trying to shoot me, strangle me, and smash my face in, he also bit your fucking ear off!”\n\n“He could have been having an episode!” My face went blank.\n\n“I’m sorry, what?”\n\n“Psychosis or some shit, I don’t know, why else wou–” before he could even finish, Theo cut him off.\n\n“I’m a psych major, Ethan. And no neuro-divergent disorders turn people’s eyes black and send you into a blood lust.” Theo let Ethan process that before he continued. “I thought I knew a thing or two about the world before what happened today… happened. But life threw what I thought I knew out of the fucking window when a giant beheaded three of my best friends. Your brother tried to kill you, and your friend. I am beyond sorry that I killed him, but I made a game time decision. It was either drop him or let him kill you two.”\n\nSilence filled the air and it was louder than a gunshot. Ethan looked back down at his brother, who’s eyes were still black and mouth was hanging open. He brushed Jimmy’s cheek with his hand. He began to whimper.\n\n“He… his kids. Amanda… he has people.”\n\n“We all do, Ethan,” I said in between whimpers of my own. “And we gotta make sure you get back home because Jimmy’s family is gonna need you to take care of them.” Ethan nodded, letting a few more tears fall onto Jimmy’s face before he looked back up at me.\n\n“Ok.” He rested Jimmy carefully onto the floor. “Where’s uh.. Where’s a shovel.” He stood up, and took a step.\n\nThat’s when Jimmy grabbed Ethan by the leg.",

        "text": " \n\nI am writing here in hopes to comfort myself from the thing terrorizing my husband and me. I’ve heard that this post has a number of people who have dealt with similar problems as mine. I should begin by saying that this is not some kind of story I have written up for entertainment, I need help and answers for how to solve this. I recently bought a house with my husband. It was supposed to be a sweet place for us to make memories after our marriage. The house was bought for cheap, it was really all we could afford on our budget. The listing was set on a normal housing site so really there should have been no problems. We moved in a month ago in November, the house was a bit old and creaky, but that's what we got for the amount of money we paid for. The first problem was the leaking. One morning I was vacuuming and I noticed a stain on the wooden floor almost rust colored. I cursed and looked up at the ceiling expecting to see some water damage, but nothing was there, the ceiling was fine. It was strange, where could the stain have come from? I looked around till I noticed the wall, it was bleeding. Just in the middle of the wall a rusty colored red oozed out. It startled me, but I like to think before I react there must be a logical reason to this. So I got a towel and dotted the wall, cleaning up the red from my wooden floors and floral painted walls. It was disgusting to clean up, but really I didn't want to ruin my new house. I threw the red stained towel into the wash and went about my day. It was weird but I had things to do and one weird thing couldn't keep me from my duties. I wish I had cared a little more, maybe then I wouldn't be dealing with this mess. \n\nWhen Larry, my husband got home, he kissed me and began to say, “ The house looks good so far.”He grinned a toothy smile I fell in love with, but then he paused looking at something behind me. “What is that?’He furrowed his brow.\n\nAs I turned around I saw red oozing from the yellow wall, but what was strange was we were in a different room than where the red had originally come from. Larry walked closer to the wall and touched the red ooze.\n\nHe quickly cursed, “What the Hell is this?!”, I ran over and observed his hands.\n\nWhere the red ooze had touched his hands it stained them black. He had quickly rubbed the ooze on his pants so the only black parts of his hands were his fingertips.\n\n“Larry, are you okay, do you need ice?”, it was all I could think of asking. I had no clue what happened to his fingers, maybe a chemical burn? Instead of responding Larry was staring at the wall spaced out, as if I wasn’t even there.\n\n“Larry…?”, I reached to touch his shoulder and he jolted away from me.\n\n“I…I am fine it must have been just some weird paint…”, He gave me a toothy grin and that gave me the belief he was fine. After all, I had fallen in love with that toothy grin and it gave me some comfort. That night was our first time sleeping in the house. I was tired from cleaning and organizing the house so I practically fell into bed. I waited for Larry to come join me, he normally would come in and wrap me in his arms as we fell asleep, but after twenty minutes he still wasn't in bed. I was alone in the dark room. It was not fully set up so it was just our bed with a bunch of boxes surrounding it. The floors in the room, similar to most of the other rooms in the house, were wooden. The house seemed to creak and sway, I felt like a scared child in the dark.\n\n“Larry…Larry..?”, I called out my voice a bit shaky. I feel a bit ashamed at how scared I was, but the dark and lack of my husband was starting to scare me. There was no response, then my thoughts got the best of me. I was worried something had happened to him, so I got out of bed walking across the creaky floors with my phone flashlight.\n\n“Larry, are you okay…?”, I tiptoed out of our room and I felt as if something was watching me. I tiptoed a bit faster, continuing to call for Larry. I had checked all the rooms except for the room with yellow wallpaper and the one with floral wallpaper, since both of the rooms had the red ooze. \n\nI bite my tongue before walking into our floral living room, “Larry please, I’m scared.”\n\nThe room was empty, my heart began racing. That left the yellow entryway, the place Larry had touched the ooze. I walked towards the entryway feeling more and more watched as I got closer. Then I saw a shadow in the shape of my husband standing by the wall, however my heart did not stop pounding.\n\n“Larry…can we go to bed..?”, I almost whispered out. Then I flashed my phone light onto the shadow. I gasped my hands shaking, that was my husband but he was mostly covered in a red ooze and the parts that weren't covered were stained that chalky black. I almost didnt recognize him, but when I saw his face it was plastered with a big toothy grin. I screamed, closing my eyes hoping for this nightmare to go away. \n\nThen I felt two hands shake me awake, “Veronica…Veronica…VERONICA!” , my husband called my name and I shot up in bed. The lights were on and my husband looked at me with concern.\n\n“Whats wrong darling…?”, he cooed. My breath was shaky, but slowly I got it under control. I had been asleep? That was strange I hadn’t remembered falling asleep.\n\nI looked at him trying to muster a smile, “I..I'm fine just had a bad dream.” I looked down at his hands and noticed he was wearing gloves.\n\n“Gloves…?” I said looking at him.\n\n“Yeah, its a bit cold in here.”, He showed his toothy grin that seemed to not be as comforting.\n\n“Oh I see..” I said, “I am ready to sleep now, how about you?”\n\nHe paused for a moment, “Yeah I am too .”, and with that we both went to bed.\n\nThat morning I woke up exhausted, I rubbed my eyes as I got up preparing to go to work. I went through my normal routine brushing my teeth and hair, putting on clothes, and make some toast and coffee. Something was wrong though, but I couldn’t place what it was. The timer went off for the coffee and I took out two mugs for my husband and I. Then it hit me, where was my husband? \n\n“Larry coffee is ready!”, I called out and waited for a reply.\n\nThere was silence so I grabbed my coffee and checked the time, and realized I needed to get in my car or I’d be late to work. I didn’t have any paper to leave a note, since we were still unpacking, so I just left the coffee in the kitchen and texted Larry saying there was coffee in there. I then slipped on my shoes and headed out to the car. Larry’s car was still in the driveway, but I thought nothing of it since it was his day off. I got to work and began to edit the final draft for my paragraph in the newspaper. I work for a newspaper company. I won’t name which one, because I don’t think it is very relevant to the story. During my break I checked my phone to see if Larry had texted me back. However when I went to check I just saw that he had read the message, but had not responded. It was strange for him, since normally he would respond right away to my text and would tell me how much he loved me. I didn’t have much time to dwell in that though, because I had to get back to work. After a long day I drove home. I was looking forward to seeing how far Larry had gotten to setting up the house, since we had agreed to take turns unboxing on our days off. I pulled up to the driveway and opened the door to the house sliding off my shoes on my way in. \n\n“Honey I’m home!”, I called out but there was no reply,”Larry?” I called again. \n\nI placed down my bag and began to search the house for him. I started in the kitchen where I found that the coffee had been cleaned up. I smiled at least I knew he had gotten the coffee. I began to walk twords our room after searching the rest of the house, and yes I even searched the two rooms which had the red ooze. Now something about our house was that we had an attic, but in order to get to it you would have to pull down a latch on the ceiling in our hallway leading to our bedroom. After pulling on the latch a ladder would unfold and would allow you to climb up, and when you wanted to close the ladder you would just pull on the latch and it the ladder would fold back up and automatically lock. We had been warned by the real estate agent that if you happened to be in the attic and the ladder closed behind you you would need someone to unlock it from the other side, since the door would auto lock leaving you trapped. Now when I got to the hallway I saw the ladder leading to the attic was down. I called out to Larry thinking he must’ve gone up in the attic to clean or to put some boxes up there. I called out to him one last time, before I decided to climb up the ladder.\n\n“Larry are you up there?”, I said this slowly going closer to the ladder.\n\nThen I heard a CRASH in the attic.\n\n“Larry!?”, I frantically said running up the ladder.\n\nI got to the top and turned on my phone light, since the attic was pitch black. I shined the light taking the last step into the attic. I looked around before I noticed the red on the walls. There was a lump in my throat as I walked closer to the walls. I shined my phone light observing the walls closer. My stomach was in knots as a terrible realization came to me, not only was the walls in attic bleeding red the red ooze spelled out the words “THE BLOOD TURNS TO BLACK THE BLACK TURNS TO ASH THE ASH FEEDS THE WALLS” I felt sick my stomach was churning into something unsavory. The room began spinning, what the hell was wrong with this house? Why was this happening? Then I passed out, and as soon as I had fallen asleep I woke up to my husband looming over me.\n\nMy head was aching, “Larry..? Is that you?” I mumbled.\n\nHe waited a minute before responding, “ Yes darling it’s me.”\n\nI sat up and quickly looked at the walls, “Larry give me my phone.”\n\nHe didn’t question me and just handed it to me. I turned on the flash and began looking for the message. There was nothing, it was gone, or was it even there in the first place?\n\n“What..where did it go?”, my eyes widened as I got up and searched the attic for the message.\n\n“Darling what’s wrong?”\n\n“It’s..it’s gone.”\n\n“What’s gone?”\n\n“ The red ooze! It was all over the walls-“ I said rambling, looking back I must’ve seen crazy.\n\n“ I don’t know what you’re talking about. I found you up here after searching for you. Then I decided to check the attic to see if you had accidentally locked yourself up here,and that’s when I found you.”\n\n“No..that’s not right. That couldn’t be..” I mumbled pacing around the attic.\n\nLarry came up behind me and hugged me from behind. That should have been comforting, but he was ice cold. I looked down and noticed he was still wearing gloves. I tried to push him away, but he clasped on harder.\n\n“Why are you so cold and you are still wearing those gloves? ”, I asked this still trying to get away from his arms.\n\n“Veronica, I think you need some sleep.” , he said, picking me up bridal style.\n\nI couldn’t argue, my head was pounding and maybe he was right. I didn’t know what was happening, maybe moving was putting some kind of stress causing me to pass out and have nightmares. He took me downstairs and placed me into our bed kissing me before lying down next to me. \n\n“I love you.” He said.\n\n“I love you more.” I smiled waiting for him to respond, but he didn’t.\n\nSomething my husband and I did was when we said I love you, we would say a sequence of responses. Yes I know it’s cheesy, but we’ve done this since before we were married. After saying I love you he would say I love you to the moon and back, and I’d say I love you so much I’d buy you the moon, and lastly we would say at the same time and I’d love you for eternity. Again I know it’s cheesy, but it was just one of the things that made me love him even more.\n\n“I love you to the moon and back.”, I said his line hoping maybe he would finish our little ritual.\n\n“ You are so sweet.” He replied.\n\nI just rolled over, trying to ignore the pit in my stomach. Something was wrong with him. He wasn’t acting like his usual self, and it was making me sick. I decided to sleep, hoping when I woke up I wouldn’t be so paranoid. I drifted to sleep without any problems and I didn’t have any nightmares. However that was short lived, I woke up to my husband leaving our bed and walking out of the room. I waited a couple minutes before checking the time; it was 2:19 a.m . I opened up my phone and opened my messages app. I texted myself  “This is not a dream.” What I’m going to say may sound paranoid but I then covered myself in a blanket and opened the notebook app and wrote the same thing. If the walls were alive then I didn’t want them to see me writing this message. I pushed the covers off and put my phone in my pocket. Then I slowly got out of bed and headed to the entryway, trying to make as little noise as possible. He was there again in the entryway, I crept up trying to see what he was doing. He was whispering something, touching the walls as he continued to mumble.\n\n“It’s almost time, it’s almost time she doesn’t know, the walls must be fed.” \n\nMy heart almost stopped everything began to spin again. I fell backwards cursing. Larry turned around and I think he smiled but it was to dark to tell.\n\n“Oh Veronica.”, he hummed walking closer to me, “ You are so foolish.”, at this point he was towering over me. \n\n“Larry,wh..what the hell are you doing.”, I knew he was smiling as his white teeth shined in the dark. Oh god were they always that sharp? What happened to the smile I fell in love with?\n\n“You will realize soon, but not yet no not yet.” Then he punched me in the head causing me to pass out.\n\nThat brings me to right now, I woke up in my bed with my head pounding harder than last night. I asked Larry and he said I must’ve hit it harder than I thought last night in the attic. I almost believed him no…it that thing is not my husband. That was until I looked at my phone, the text was deleted but the notebook page was not. I was not asleep what happened was very real, in fact I don’t think I was ever dreaming, everything that happened must have been real. Please someone help, I can hear him singing in the kitchen cooking breakfast. Larry can’t cook or sing, that thing is not my husband. The walls must be fed and I think I’m it’s next meal. I think I’m going to try and sneak out without my husband noticing, so I can get to work early and research this stupid house. I guess working in a newspaper company has its perks. If I don’t respond I am probably dead. Please tell me if you guys have any idea what is going on, any advice is welcomed.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1049nvr/there_are_animatronics_where_i_work_and_i_dont/",
        "text": "I work at an establishment that specializes in children's birthday parties. We have a group of characters that sings the birthday and are on all the cups. One of the things the place is known for is the animatronics of those characters.\n\nAlmost everyone my age (people who grew up on the internet) who comes in asks about the animatronics and compares it to FNAF. Y'know, the typical \"Are they alive?\" \"Have you seen them move?\", and so on. \n\nI started working there recently, so I always thought the other employees were joking when they would answer \\*yes\\*. It's the type of thing where you play along with the bit, like improv or whatever. Like when a kid comes up to you and says they have superpowers, you just play along. That's all it was.\n\nAt least that's all I thought it was. \n\nI don't often work the opening shift, I'm not a manager or anything, but I took someone elses shift. The managers have a rule that no one opens or closes alone, so I wasn't alone when I entered the building at 5am. Normally people don't come in until after lunch (kids don't tend to want to get up in the morning), so we have the morning to ourselves. It's mostly set up; cleaning tables, changing out the napkin holders, setting up the VIP birthday tables, food and salad bar prep, etc. The manager who opened with me had to call into a meeting with the big bosses (I don't exactly know, I wasn't listening), and she was going to be closed in her office until 8am. \n\nSo I was essentially alone for the morning. \n\nI put on my headphones and started going around and sweeping the main floor. The set up of the store/restaurant(?) is pretty simple. You enter and have the front counter immediately infront of you, directly to your left is the main/game room. Its a large area that has all of the arcade machines and the tables. There is a hallway at the back that goes to the kitchen, that is behind the front counter (the break room and managers office are there too), bathrooms, and a storage room. \n\nI am usually the one who has to deal with the animatronics. We don't really set up the animatronics anymore, instead there is a suit that an employee (usually me) wears. The animatronics haven't been turned on or plugged in in years, and tend to gather dust-bunnies like flies to fly paper.\n\nBoth the suit and animatronics are in this storage room. Part of my opening routine is to go into the storage room and clear out any dust that has gathered. \n\nThats where I was at like 5:30. \n\nI was jamming, as one does when they have their music turned all the way up. I was sweeping and minding my business, when one of the animatronics turned on. I didn't think much about it, there was a work party the night before and they must have messed with the animatronics for fun. \n\nThe animatronics are in a line, backs to a wall. This means that I have to go around and behind the other animatronics to get to this ones plug. I struggle, stepping through cobwebs one after another. I get to the one that turned on and its not plugged in. \n\nThe thing about this specific character is that it wouldn't (or shouldn't) work even if it was plugged in. A while back a rat had chewed through the cord. I stood behind the wall of characters, staring at this cord for a solid minute, perplexed. \n\nI decided that it must be left over juice from when I was plugged in, so I left it alone. If you couldn't tell, I don't know much about the machinery of the animatronics. \n\nI slide out from behind the character line-up and was about to return to my chores when I see a light. I thought it was a reflection at first, because it moved. It couldn't be, there was no window, and the only light source was from the main room light spilling in through the open storage door. I turn. The animatronic (the mouse) I was looking at had turned its head to look at me. \n\nI felt my stomach drop. \n\nIt had to be someone messing with the new employee. I stepped out of the room, shouting, \"I swear if one of you is trying to scare me I will punch you if you show up behind me in that suit.\"  \nI returned to the room and put the mouse's head back in the resting position. Not scared, but still on edge, I continued sweeping. After 3 or 4 beats, I heard a clunk. \n\nThe mouse was looking at me again. This time, however, it was in the middle of stepping off of the platform the characters were all lined up on. I frooze. No way this was happening. \n\nIt had to be a joke, right?\n\nI decided it wouldn't phase me, so I kept sweeping. Albeit without my headphones on. Even if it was turned on somehow, its not like it would hurt me. It was programed to sing Happy Birthday and do a dumb dance. The most it could do was sing to loud or out of tune.   \nRight?  \nThankfully, the mouse was quiet for a while as I finished up sweeping. Unfortunately, the world is cruel. As I finished tossing the colony of dust bunnies in the bin, I heard that dreadful clunk clunk. I should elaborate, the clunk sound is not the sound of dropping a trunk on the ground. It is the grating sound of jagged metal dragging across cement floors. It is not high pitched, rather its like biting down on chalk. \n\nThat god damn mouse was infront of the door. The door was still open, but the entrance was blocked by this 6 foot something mouse robot. My phone told me that it was 6:15. The next person  scheduled to come in was at 7. I sighed, *ffuck this*.\n\nI decided that 3 times is too many. I crawled under the legs of the mouse and out of the storage room. There was no way I was touching that thing, let alone moving it back. So I just closed the door. I was on kitchen duty that day, so I didn't have to wear the suit. \n\nThankfully. \n\nNo one else said anything about the animatronics, and I didn't say anything. \n\nI haven't been scheduled for an opening shift since. I'm not worried about opening again.\n\nI am, however, worried about my closing shift tomorrow.",

Cooper was the first to reach land followed by Jimmy, then Theo, then Ethan. I was the last to pull up so I arrived a bit late to the conversation that was already being had.\n\n“... his back man, you agreed to come, Jimmy!” Ethan was yelling at Jimmy, who appeared to be in hysterics.\n\n“I wasn’t told there were going to be GIANTS, Ethan!”\n\n“How the hell was he supposed to know that! Even if there was some way he could’ve, would you have believed him?”\n\n“I…. FUCK MAN! Fuck!”Jimmy kicked the sand on the bank and walked in a circle. “We’ve got four more days to wait out till help comes to pick us up! How are we going to even survive that long?”\n\n“We’ll figure it out. In the meantime let’s–” Cooper, who’s usually one of the calmest people I know, butt in.\n\n“E, can you not see that we are IMMEASURABLY fucked at the moment?” I got out of my boat and made my way over to them. Theo, was hugging his knees and sobbing, sitting a little ways away from the conflict.\n\n“Cooper–” said Ethan. “You gotta chill man. If you don’t chill–”\n\n“ Don’t tell me to CHILL, Ethan! I just watched Goliath tear three people into pieces–” I pointed my gun to the river and fired. Everyone shut up real quick and looked my way. I had their attention, and one less bullet in this magazine.\n\n“We have four days left in these woods. Four days to get to the base of this river or we are absolutely screwed without any chance of survival. Does everyone understand that?” Heads began to nod.\n\n“Ok.” I paused. I needed to think of something or these guys were gonna tear each other's throats out before the giant would ever get a second chance to. “We know something everyone else who died before did not know. We know FOR A FACT that something is out there, looking to kill us–”\n\n“How is that supposed to make us feel better–”\n\n“It isn’t Jimmy, so shut the fuck up please.” He looked to his feet, quiet as a cucumber. “That thing can be injured by bullets, I shot the bastard today. We all have guns… save for Theo, sorry buddy.”\n\n“Oh crap, you’re righ–”\n\n“We can hurt, and possibly kill… whatever it is. And the fact that we know it exists takes away its ability to surprise us…” I looked into the woods. Everyone followed suit. We stared for maybe ten seconds.\n\nNothing, thank God.\n\n“*Theoretically*, it should not be able to surprise us *as easily*. And… that gives us some kind of heads up on the competition.” Theo’s face went pale when he heard the word.\n\n“Head… why… What is it doing with their heads? I mean you guys saw it! The bodies, they all didn’t have heads. It–” he paused and he shook his head. “It ripped off Kyler’s head… it ripped off Sau–” he didn’t finish the sentence. Instead, he began to dry-heave. Ethan put his arm around Theo, and patted his back as he heaved and cried..\n\n*This poor kid,* I thought to myself. He’d watched his best friends get literally ripped apart barely an hour ago.\n\n“We’re gonna get you out of here, Theo,” I said. “We’re all getting out of here.” Jimmy was the first to question my optimism.\n\n“How Frankie? How do you expect us to last the next four days when that THING is after us?” It was a valid question. One I didn’t really have a good answer for. What I did have to offer was honesty.\n\n“We gotta just keep making pace–”\n\n“We’re dead–” said Cooper.\n\n“I’m serious. Our best chance is to keep moving and pray that we can get to the base of the river and avoid it until our ride gets here.” I thought for a second. “Besides, it didn’t attack us BEFORE we got to the valley in Second canyon. Maybe it's trapped there.”\n\n“And maybe it isn’t trapped there, and that’s just the best place to kill people?” asked Theo.\n\n“That’s also a possibility. But now that we know the thing exists, it’s gonna be a lot harder for it to sneak up on us. Especially because we’ll be armed and as ready as we can be.” Looks were exchanged amongst the panicers. Ethan did me a huge solid by offering some support.\n\n“If we can’t get our shit together, boys, we will be as good as dead. An idea is better than no idea, and being that this is the only option we have, I suggest we stick to the original plan, this time, with our heads on a swivel.” And that was what we did.\n\nWe busted the guns out of our bags and moved them onto our persons.\n\nFood was made.\n\nSmall talk was kept to a minimum.\n\nFor the most part, everyone was on edge and kept to themselves. Around six we realized we’d probably have to stay put for the night and wait to head into Third Canyon in the morning, on account of the setting sun. No one was happy about that. Camp was set up, tents were pitched, and we came to sit around the fire.\n\n“We’re gonna need someone to keep watch tonight.” said Coop after a long bout of silence. Ethan was quick to jump in after him.\n\n“No. We need two folks on watch.”\n\n“Why two?” asked Theo. The answer was pretty simple so I just threw it out.\n\n“Because they can keep each other awake until the next shift.” Ethan nodded at me.\n\n“Exactly.” Silence filled the air after Ethans affirmation. No one wanted to stay up for the first watch. I couldn’t blame them. The day had been an emotionally and physically exhausting endeavor. I volunteered to take the first shift. And in a surprising turn of events, Jimmy said,\n\n“Then I will too.” All of our heads turned to him. “What.”\n\n“No, no … it’s just…” Ethan stammered. “Didn’t see that coming.”\n\n“I’d rather just stay up later and go to bed for a bit before we move again then have to wake up in the middle of the night and ride in a bumpy kayak with no sleep.” Nods were exchanged between the other group members, being that it now made sense.\n\nTheo, Ethan, and Cooper hit the hay, Jimmy and I sat by the fire, facing the woods with our guns in our laps. We’d been close in high school, but over the years, I’d gotten a little closer with his brother than I was with him.When Jimmy met Amanda, she began to occupy more and more of his time. I moved out of the midwest and to the east coast, he had kids, and we began to drift apart. There wasn’t any negativity between us, we were just both… busy.\n\nI was glad he volunteered for the same shift as me because I knew it’d give us a chance to reconnect, and it did.\n\nHe told me about how Molly and Jacob were ten and eight now.\n\nHow Molly had a solo in “Hey Jude” at her last choir concert.\n\nHow Jacob hit a triple in tee ball this season.\n\nHow the kids loved going bowling with him and Ethan.\n\nHow happy he was.\n\nAnd I was happy for him.\n\n“I’m glad I got to see you again, man.” I smiled at that.\n\n“I’m glad too, Jimbo. I wish the circumstances were different.”\n\n“Me too.” He took a beat and I saw his face drop before he spoke again. “F,nkie, I don’t want to die here.” Those words felt like a knife in my gut. I’d dragged him, and Ethan and Cooper here. He had a wife and kids at home. And there was a very very good chance that we weren’t going to be able to make it out of Nahanni alive. His fears were one-hundred-percent rational. We could end up dead by the end of the night. We all knew this. Still, I felt I had to offer some kind of hope.\n\n“If we stick together, we won’t.”\n\n“But how can you know that for sure?” His eyes were watering now. I couldn’t bare to look in them any longer. My head dropped.\n\n“I can’t, Jim. I can’t… all I can say is we give ourselves the best chance possible if we do. And we owe it to ourselves to have a fighting chance. I owe it to you guys. You followed me into the fucking wilderness on a whim because I asked you to. I’m gonna try my damndest to get all of us out of here, ok?” My friend didn’t answer me. I looked up to see why that was and… and his eyes.\n\nHis eyes had turned black as the night sky.\n\n“J-Jim?” His response wasn’t a verbal one. It was an action.\n\nHe reached for his gun.\n\n“Jim what the fuck is this?” He picked it up and pointed it to me. Before I even knew what happened, he squeezed the trigger.\n\nAnd nothing happened. The safety was still on. He didn’t realize it was still on. He was trying to shoot me. I lunged for the gun in his hand, and as I did, he flipped off the safety. He pulled the trigger again as I felt the barrel dig into the outside of my arm. A bullet took a fat chunk of me out of my arm and I felt pain like I had never felt before. A wail clawed its way out of my throat as I managed to rip the gun out of Jimmy’s grasp. Now up close, I could see how black his eyes had become. It was almost as if there were voids under his corneas. Absolute nothing. I threw his gun toward Theo’s tent and managed to let out the beginning of a “HELP” before Jimmy had his hands around my neck and his knees on my shoulders. He began to slam my head against the sandy ground over and over again and chant in some language I’d never heard of before.\n\n“Pleee–” I managed to squeak out. I couldn’t help but feel like I deserved this as I slowly had the life squeezed out of me. I dragged them here. I killed us all. It’s only fitting that I be the first to go.\n\nAnd then the grip was released. I gasped as the air found its way back into my lungs. I looked up to see Ethan now wrestling with Jimmy.\n\n“What the fuck is wrong with you Jimmy?!” Ethan got his brother into a triangle hold. Jimmy squirmed and flailed his limbs to no avail.\n\n“He tried to shoot me!” Ethan took his eyes off his brother.\n\n“What?!” It was for a second too long, though. Jimmy slammed a closed fist into his brother’s nether regions. Jimmy broke free and Ethan, who was in a considerable amount of pain, dropped to his knees, clutching his groin. Jimmy began to beat down on his brother’s face with his fists.\n\n“JIMMY, JESUS CHRIST!” I tried to stand, but I stumbled and fell flat on my ass. I was still dizzy from almost losing consciousness. I looked back up to see him bite Ethan’s left ear off. Ethan wailed and screamed as Jimmy spit it out onto the sand. That’s when he turned his attention back onto me. Jimmy snarled when his eyes met mine. He got on all fours and began to slowly crawl toward me.\n\n“Jimmy…” there was no look of recognition in those black eyes. “Jimmy.”And then he charged me. “JIMMY!”\n\nHe was ten,\n\nFive,\n\nTwo feet away from me when:\n\nBANG!\n\nBANG!\n\nBANG\n\nJimmy’s chest blew open, sending splats of blood and chunks of rib in all directions as his body fell on top of me. Blood spurted out from the bullet wounds in his torso.\n\nAny possibility of getting an answer as to why he attacked us was as dead as the man I held in my arms. The man I grew up with, who I considered to be my brother. He was dead.\n\nAnd mere minutes before I was promising him that I’d try my best to get him out of this forest alive.\n\n“JIMMY?!” Ethan screamed, holding the gushing wound on the side of his head. He made his way over to me. I looked over my shoulder to see what exactly killed Jimmy:\n\nIt was Theo, holding the gun I threw towards his tent.\n\nEthan sprinted to Jimmy’s lifeless body and pulled him off of me. He began to sob and caress what remained of his brother.\n\n“What the fuck did you have to shoot him for?!” Theo began to stammer.\n\n“I– he– it was trying to kill–”\n\n“It?!?” Rage filled Ethan’s eyes as he continued to cradle Jimmy. “*It* was MY FUCKING BROTHER!” He began to sob again.\n\nI didn’t know what to make of ANY of this. Theo had just murdered Jimmy. Jimmy had just tried to shoot me, and he attacked Ethan.\n\n“He was gonna kill you, Ethan!”\n\n“You don’t know that! You don’t fucking know that, Theo! You just met him last night! You don’t know anything!” Ethan was beside himself. I looked to Theo again to notice the poor kid had gone and pissed down his leg. He was just as scared as us. He’d faced loss today too. And he tried to do the right thing.\n\n“E,” I spoke up. “He wasn’t him anymore.” Ethan looked to me now.\n\n“What the hell is that supposed to even mean, Frankie?”\n\n“I mean… I.” I looked for the right words to no avail. No matter how I could put it, what I thought to be true was going to sound insane. “Ethan, I think Jimmy was possessed.” He stared me dead in the eyes for what felt like a year.\n\n“Are you out of your Goddamn mind? Possessed?” He took it how I thought he would have.\n\n“We were attacked by a Giant not even eight hours ago E, I’ve given up on what I thought I knew was impossible.”\n\n“What would even lead you to think that?”\n\n“I don’t know man. Besides him trying to shoot me, strangle me, and smash my face in, he also bit your fucking ear off!”\n\n“He could have been having an episode!” My face went blank.\n\n“I’m sorry, what?”\n\n“Psychosis or some shit, I don’t know, why else wou–” before he could even finish, Theo cut him off.\n\n“I’m a psych major, Ethan. And no neuro-divergent disorders turn people’s eyes black and send you into a blood lust.” Theo let Ethan process that before he continued. “I thought I knew a thing or two about the world before today… happened. But a giant and now this threw all of what I thought I knew out of the fucking window, man. Your brother tried to kill you, and your friend. I am beyond sorry that I killed him, but I made a game time decision. It was either let him kill you two, or put an end to whatever that just was.”\n\nSilence filled the air and it was louder than a gunshot. Ethan looked back down at his brother, who’s eyes were still black and mouth was hanging open. He brushed Jimmy’s cheek with his hand. He began to whimper.\n\n“He… his kids. Amanda… he has people.”\n\n“We all do, Ethan,” I said in between whimpers of my own. “And we gotta make sure you get back home because Jimmy’s family is gonna need you to take care of them.” Ethan nodded, letting a few more tears fall onto Jimmy’s face before he looked back up at me.\n\n“Ok.” He rested Jimmy carefully onto the floor. “Where’s uh.. Where’s a shovel.” He stood up, and took a step.\n\nThat’s when Jimmy grabbed Ethan by the leg.",

        "text": "\nJumping slightly, I hunched forward while looking behind me.  Carol was back there, smiling at me with her small eyes and too-broad face.  She scrunched up her nose.\n\n“Sorry!  You just had a tag poking up.”\n\nUgh.  Why did that mean she needed to touch me?  She was always doing stuff like that.  Invading people’s personal space, touching them, making weird comments.  For someone in HR, she didn’t seem to get what made people uncomfortable.\n\n“Oh…okay.  Well, thanks I guess.”\n\nShe squinted back at me in what was probably supposed to be a grin but made her look like a demented chipmunk.  “No prob, hun!”\n\nUgh.\n\nTurning away, I made a point of taking a couple of steps forward, even if it meant invading the personal space of the guy in front of *me*.  At least he didn’t have to worry about me creepily touching his…\n\n“Gah!”\n\nShe’d touched my neck *again*.  What the fuck was her problem?  Turning back around, I didn’t temper my glare this time.\n\n“What’re you doing?”\n\nShe scrunched her face at me again like she was taking a painful shit and was happy about it.  “Sowwy.  You’ve still got something poking out back there.  Trying to get it.”\n\nFrowning, I shook my head at her.  “No.  Just…just leave it.  It’s fine.”  I turned back around, still angry.  I didn’t know what good it would do, but I was really close to reporting her if she kept this shit up.  She’d always been a bit weird and off-putting, but this was ridiculous.\n\nThe next few minutes passed slowly and the line moved forward a few more feet.  Bored, I took out my phone and started writing all this down.  When I looked up next, I saw Jenny from upstairs further along the curving path of people.  I felt my stomach tense a little.  She was beautiful, and way out of my league, but hadn’t she been friendly the couple of times we had talked?  And when we had that week-long seminar last summer, she’d sat next to me and joked around some too.  Normally I didn’t see her enough to make small talk or look for an opening to ask her out, and I felt awkward just going upstairs to visit her like we were really friends.  But if I could figure out a way to get up to her spot in the line, then maybe…\n\nI felt a searing pain in the back of my neck as my thighs tensed and my knees felt floaty and close to buckling.  It was like someone was trying to pull my insides, or at least my nervous system, out through my neck, and I twisted violently around to make it stop.  Carol was looking up at me, a nasty smirk on her face.\n\n“I almost had it that time.  It’s a thread I think.  A red piece of thread.”  She giggled, her eyes still hard.  “It’s funny.  Your shirt isn’t red.  And it almost looks like it’s growing out of your neck.”\n\nGasping, I blinked back tears as I tried to figure out what to do.  My first impulse was to punch her and walk away.  Go to the bathroom or go home or something.  Or a doctor.  Figure out if something was really wrong with me or I was just being freaked out by her crazy.\n\nBut I held back.  If I hit her, or did anything violent, I’d be the one that got called crazy and violent.  I’d probably get fired and arrested.  My hand trailed up to the back of my neck.  I did feel something back there.  It could be a thread.  And…was it stuck to my skin or something?  \n\nShuddering, I dropped my hand and took a deep breath.  I had to stay in control of myself while getting her to leave me alone.  Fighting the frustrated fear I was feeling, I leaned down into her face and spoke in a low tone.\n\n“Leave me alone, you crazy bitch.  If you touch me again, I’ll report you.”  Then, thinking about the weird HR speak they always told us about at meetings, I added.  “This is your formal warning and notice that you are harassing me and I want it to stop.”\n\nHer eyebrows furrowed at me in anger, but I didn’t wait for a response before turning back around.  I’d just ignore her.  Maybe I could find a way to move up to where Jenny was, but for now I’d just look at her or my phone and…\n\n“That’s what you like, huh?  Little pretty with nothing in her head.”  Her voice was soft and light, but I could hear the anger there.  I forced myself not to respond.\n\n“Little pretty is a slut, you know.  A stupid little slut that will spread her legs for anyone that will get her ahead or buy her shiny things.”\n\nI felt a flare of anger and turned slightly so my whisper would carry back to Carol as the line moved forward a little.  “You’re a sad and mean creep.  She’s not stupid.  What, you’re jealous of her so that makes her dumb and a slut?  And what business of yours is it an…AHHH!”\n\nThe pain in my neck was a hundred times worse now, and the jolt from it did bring me down on my knees and then to laying twitching on the floor.  Carol was on top of me, pulling on the string or whatever it was, laughing as I screamed and flailed, unable to control my limbs or even ask for help beyond a wordless wail.  \n\nNot that it would have mattered.  The line had stopped for the moment, but no one was looking around at what was happening to me.  Either I was invisible or nobody cared.  I gagged as Carol’s hot breath washed over my tear-streaked face.\n\n“It *is* my business because *you’re* my business.”  She had repositioned herself now, keeping my string pulled tight in one hand while she stuffed the other down the back of my pants with sharp, questing fingers milling against and into my flesh.  I let out a new, deeper wail, pleading inside for Jenny or someone to help me.   But nothing.  Just the sound of my pain and Carol’s harsh, excited panting as she hurt and violated me over and over again.\n\nI blacked out for some of it I think.  Or at least my mind made it a blur.  When she was finally done, she kissed the side of my head and let go of my string with a last, contemptuous whisper.\n\n“Get up.  You’re holding up the line.”\n\nTrembling and snotting everywhere, I stood up shakily.  I…I had to leave.  I’d run and hide if I couldn’t get away.  I just couldn’t let her ever touch me again.  I went to take a step out of the line and…\n\nI couldn’t.  Letting out a wet sob, I tried again and again, but my feet wouldn’t move left or right or back.  Just\n\n“Forward.  Got to keep moving forward.”  Her voice was hoarse from all her terrible laughter…before.  The man in front of me was several steps ahead now.\n\nSucking in a breath, I tried moving with the line.  My feet worked just fine.  What…what was this?\n\n“Help!  Some…someone please help me!  I’ve been attacked.  I need…I need help getting away from here.  I can’t move right.”\n\nA low chortle behind me, but nothing else.\n\nI spent a few more minutes and steps trying to escape the line, but I can’t.  I’ve gone back to my phone and am writing it all down, thinking at first it might be the thing that saves me.  I'll send this out and maybe someone can come help me.\n\nIt’s just now that I realize I don’t remember where I am.  It’s been hard to see much other than the hard floor we’re all walking across and the line a few people ahead and behind.  When I realize I don’t remember what this line is really for or how I got here, I try to notice more details or see farther.  Staring hard into the hazy distance, I finally make something else out.  It’s hard for me to be sure at first—it must be a trick of the distance or my bleary vision or how the line is curved.\n\nBut no.  When people move again, I see it clearly.  The flow of motion like a ripple, moving to me and from me and to me again in a slow, crawling wave.\n\nThis isn’t a line.\n\n[It’s a circle.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)",

        "text": "\nI was ten years old when I was put on a plane to fly across the country and live with a Father I'd never met before. The few things I knew about him, which my social worker had told me, was that he was a veteran and he lived on the other side of the country. Social services had a hard time finding somewhere to place me after her death. My mother, who’d just passed away in a car accident on the way to work, had no immediate family. It was then determined that my Dad would take me. To this day I still can’t figure out why he’d even agreed to do this.\n\nI had many different ideas and fears about what he would be like but in reality he was simply, well, disappointing. Ever since I’d arrived at his doorstep, he’d treated me as if I was some unwanted pet. He tolerated my existence and kept me fed, but it was clear that would be the extent of our relationship.\nI still clearly remember the day he picked me up from the airport. He was waiting for me and my airplane escort at the end of the terminal and already seemed tired. I was a scared little kid, but he just gave an annoyed sigh as he led me to the car.\n\n\"Look\", he said bluntly as we were driving to my new home. \"I don't really like kids. I'll do my own thing, and you do yours. Deal?\"\n\nNot knowing how else to respond, I nodded nervously in the back seat. \n\n\"Good.\" He said, glancing at me in the rear-view mirror.\n\nIf I was disappointed in my father, I was twice as disappointed in the house. While the outside looked small and unassuming enough, the inside looked like it'd never seen a broom since the day it was built. Dirt matted the carpets and ugly stains dotted the frayed wallpaper. The house constantly smelled like rotting wood and unwashed dog even though we didn’t own a dog. My \"room\" turned out to be a single mattress in the attic.\n\nTrue to his word, my Dad ignored me and did his own thing most of the time. His routine was surprisingly simple. He’d spend most of the time watching TV and sipping beer, before going out to a bar in the evening and coming home late into the night. He was never physically abusive and he didn’t mind if I hung out in the living room with him as long as I was quiet, but the way he sighed whenever I asked for something or was too loud hurt. \n\nNaturally this wasn't exactly a prime environment for a grieving ten year old. I spent a lot of time in my “room” crying, but it was too hot and muggy up there to even do that properly. So much of my time was spent outside. \n\nAs much as I hated living there, I will say the backyard was fantastic. The yard was huge, with a thick forest that choked the edges of the large mowed lawn. I spent a lot of time exploring. The bayous and swampy forests were magical. I’d like to pretend I was an explorer discovering a new land, each ancient tree becoming a mystery, each animal calling or tadpole a new discovery. And every time I went deeper and deeper in, it was like I could leave my grief behind, if not for a moment. One day on one of my little outings, I happened upon a large clearing with an ancient willow tree, its arms stretching all the way to the ground as if they were too heavy to bear. \n\nBut what I spotted on one of its branches made my heart stop. It was my mother, dressed in one of her favorite sun dresses, humming a tune to herself and gently swinging her legs back and forth. I could only see the back of her but her profile was unmistakable. \n\nShock and fear electrified my brain. Something primal inside me was screaming at me to run away. I knew this was impossible, that it was a breach of nature. It had to be an illusion, there was no other way. But I didn't care. I burst into tears and ran to her, flinging myself on her and wrapping my arms around her waist. \n\nI completely broke, telling her how much I missed her and how much I wanted to go home. I promised I’d be a better daughter if only she’d come back. I told her I needed her and it was ok if we didn’t have that much money, just please come back. She petted my hair gently as I bared my soul to her. Despite the situation, I cried so much and fell asleep. When I woke up she was gone.\n\nThe past month I had been escaping to the swamps, heart heavy, with no ambitions except to get away from the day. But ever since I saw her in the woods, there was a change in me. I suddenly had a mission. I didn’t find her the second day, but the day after I found her in the same wooded clearing. She was turned away from me and the sun illuminated her yellow sundress. My heart jumped to my throat when I saw her. She turned to look at me, looking the least bit surprised.\n\n“Hello.” I said quietly. \n\n“Hi.” She said in my mother’s voice. But there was something off about it, it sounded colder than how I remembered she spoke.\n\n“Can I… sit with you?”\n\nShe nodded. \n\nI walked over awkwardly and sat. Now that I was here, I didn’t know what to actually say. As you can imagine, the whole scenario felt incredibly odd. However, the longer I sat with her the more I realized something.\n\n“You’re not really my Mom, are you?”\n\n“No.” She replied in a calm, mellow tone.\n\n“Then, who are you?”\n\nSilence lapsed between us. She stared off into the distance with an unreadable expression. I tried a different question.\n\n“Then, do you have a name?”\n\nShe was quiet for so long that I didn’t think she would respond when she answered.\n\n“Sarah.”\n\n“Alright then. Um, Miss Sarah.”\n\nI began asking her more questions but she either didn’t reply or her replies were short and slow. Instead, I started to talk about myself, if not to ease the awkwardness of it all. We talked for a good while (or rather, I did the talking) before the light grew dim and the forest started turning to twilight. I eventually decided to go home, but before I left I asked if I could visit her again and she agreed. I knew visiting a mystery woman in the swamp who looked like my dead Mother was well, a dumb and dangerous idea, but I couldn’t help myself. This wasn’t the type of thing I could just ignore and it wasn’t like I could tell my Dad about it, so despite my unease I kept visiting. \n   \nMy fake Mom, or Miss Sarah, wasn't the only interesting thing that happened that week. I went downstairs one morning to find my Dad and a stranger talking in the living room, packing bags for what looked like a hunting trip. I was surprised because I'd never heard my Dad talk so much, or sound so happy for that matter. The stranger turned to look at me when he heard my footsteps and looked at me in curious surprise.\n \n“Who’s this?”\n\n“Oh that’s just Lacey. Darline’s daughter, you remember Darline right? Uh, my kid.”\n   \n“I have a niece?” Said the man excitedly. “Why, you should have told me!”\n   \nHe walked over to me and shook my hand, and I was introduced to “Dale”, my sudden surprise Uncle. At first I had a positive opinion of my Uncle, as weird as it is to say it now. I was a kid who had suddenly lost her only parental figure, and Dale stepped in with all the sympathy and attention I was looking for. However, I became weary of him long before he had actually done anything.\n\n For one, if there was one word to describe my Uncle, it would be slimy. His hair was lank and greasy, and he’d often wipe his sweaty hands on his filthy pants, which did nothing but smear the grime around even more. I’d never seen him change out of his camo gear, and considering his stale smell of weed and alcohol, I was sure he never washed his outfit. Still, I wouldn’t have minded if he didn’t feel a little… off. \n\n As a single mother raising a young daughter, my mom had made it her mission to drill in my head the concept of “tricky people”. And Dale hit all my warning sensors for a tricky person. His hugs were always a little too long, he’d casually touch my shoulders from behind when I was sitting down asking if I was feeling “tense”, and he wanted me to sit on his lap when we were in the living room watching tv. For an Uncle who’d hadn’t shown up once during my time there except for the hunting trip, he had suddenly started showing up everyday. Still, it seemed to make my Dad happy he was around and I was afraid to make a big stink over nothing, so I kept my unease to myself and spent more time outside.\n\nOn the flipside, I was making great progress with Miss Sarah. I was uncomfortable and nervous at first, but I realized rather quickly that she meant no harm, and I began visiting her every day. She didn't say it but I could tell she liked the company. However, there was one obvious glaring question that I couldn’t get out of my head.\n\n“Why do you look like my mom?”\n   \n“To hunt.”\n   \n“To hunt?”\n   \n“Yes.”\n   \nI didn’t get it.\n   \n“Are you hunting me?”\n     \nShe gave the faintest of smiles.\n   \n“No.” She said, “You aren’t something to hunt.”\n   \n“Then, can you…please stop looking like her?”\n   \nShe seemed surprised.  “You do not like it?”\n   \n“No. Because… because, well- you *aren’t* her!” I said with a big sob. “I know my Mom died, I-I’m not stupid. But every time I see you it makes me think of her. Like I can almost pretend it’s really her. But you’re not her Miss Sarah. You’re n-not. I’d rather you just look like you.”\n   \nShe sat there quietly as I sniffled.\n   \n“I see.” She said simply.\n    \nAnd then the strangest thing happened. My brain felt hazy and I stared into space, and then a moment later I snapped back to normal. I looked over at Miss Sarah only to see that instead of my mother in a yellow sundress, it was a woman of indeterminate age in an old tattered dress. Her skin and hair were dark and while she now looked quite different from my mother, she still had the same quiet, unreadable look in her eyes.\n   \n“Is this what you really look like? You’re pretty.” I said.\n   \nShe smiled and patted me on the head.\n   \nMeanwhile things were getting increasingly more suffocating at home. Dale practically used Dad’s home as his own now, and he liked to come over when Dad was off to the store to “babysit”, which made me increasingly uncomfortable. Still, I think I could have put up with it if it wasn’t for what he did next. \n  \nEven years later I still remember crystal clear when it happened. Dad was out doing who knows what, and like normal, I was by myself. On that particular day I lay slouched on the couch, watching tv with the rotating fan pointed towards me, and all doors open, trying to escape the muggy summer heat. I heard the sound of tires spitting up gravel, and saw a familiar red pickup truck pull into the driveway through the window.\n   \nA moment later Dale walked in, two large plastic bags in his hands. I sat up and he gave that familiar rat-like smile. \n   \n“Hey Sweetheart.” He said. “Hot as shit eh?”\n   \n“I guess.”\n   \n“Well turn that off and look what I got yah.”\n   \nCurious, I did what he said and walked over to him. He was kneeling on the floor and focused on digging out something inside the plastic bag. After a moment, he pulled out a tiny wad of fabric and handed it to me. I unfurled it and realized it was a bright pink doll shirt with the words *Baby* stenciled on it in glittery silver. I looked at him confused, but he just grinned at me excitedly, expectantly. \n   \n“Well? Try it on!”\n   \n“This?!” I said in disbelief. It was at least two sizes too small, and the end of the shirt wouldn’t even cover my belly button.\n   \n“It’s too small!”\n   \n“It's supposed to be like that. Come on, it's what all the girls wear these days. But if you don’t like that, I have other things you can try on, look!” \n   \nHe started rummaging through the bags and pulling out items one by one. My stomach dropped as he lay them out on the floor.\n   \nThere was a skimpy sailor outfit with a skirt way too tight with a matching heart shaped gartner, shorts that bordered on looking like underwear, a couple risque looking dresses, some crop tops, and of course various types of underwear that he made sure to express were specially handpicked by him.\n   \n“So, what do you want to try on first?”\n \n “None of it.” I said staunchly, nervousness flaring in my gut.\n   \n“Oh come on, don’t be like that. I spent a lot of time- stop backing up! -picking these out. Just try on something.”\n   \nI kept denying, but Dale kept insisting. I tried to hold out, but Dale was getting more and more forceful with his urging. There was an undertone of aggressiveness to it that scared me, and my nerves were threatening to swallow me.\n   \n“Ok.” I said meekly, just wanting to get this nightmare over with.\n   \n“Excellent!”\n   \nI looked over the collection and picked out what I deemed to be the most appropriate looking item; a red wine spaghetti strapped sequin dress. I turned towards the direction of the bathroom when Dale grabbed my arm.\n   \n“Where are you going?”\n   \n“To the bathroom.”\n   \n“No, you’re going to put it on here.”\n   \n“What?!”\n   \n“I want to see you put it on. So I can make sure you are putting it on properly.”\n   \nWe broke out into an argument again, but this time Dale was out of patience. His tone flared right up into that angry undertone again, and he started shouting and waving his arms in an agitated manner.\n   \n“Put. On. The. Dress. *Put on the dress!* The underwear too! I want to see you put it on!”\n   \nI shook in place, sobbing and gripping the dress as he increasingly grew angrier and angrier.\n      \n“What’s going on here?”\n   \nDale’s head whipped around to see a concerned and confused looking Dad standing in the doorframe. Neither of us had heard his car pull up, but a sudden sense of relief flushed through me. Dale’s eyes went wide.\n    \n“I bought Lacey new clothes for school and she hates them.”\n   \n“What? Is that true?” Dad said, looking at me.\n   \n“N-no!” I managed to choke out.\n   \n“I thought she probably didn’t have a lot of clothes now since she moved, so I wanted to be nice and buy her some. But she hates them. They’re not stylish enough for her.”\n   \n“Lacey!” Dad barked, frowning. \n   \nI wanted to defend myself, but it was like there was a large golf ball in my throat, and the words simply wouldn’t rise.\n   \n“Your Uncle goes out of his way to be nice to you, and this is how you act?” He began stomping over.  “You’re such an ungrateful…” his tone trailed off once he got close enough to actually see the clothing laid out on the floor. \n\nHis eyes widened and he stared at them. Dale tried to hastily stuff them in the bag and quickly said, “I don’t know what kids like these days so I only got what the female clerk recommended to me. I just got what she said to get, but I don’t really know what kids like these days, you know?” He gave a nervous laugh.\n   \nDad was quiet for a moment, then said, “Lacey got to your room.” His tone had lost almost all its previous anger however.\n\nHe didn’t need to tell me twice, and I gratefully escaped. I don’t know what Dad and Dale talked about, but I didn’t see Dale for the next week. Dad seemed pretty depressed about it, but didn’t talk about it so I never asked.\n   \nI gratefully regaled this to Miss Sarah. That had become our routine. I would talk and talk about whatever was on my mind and Miss Sarah would listen. Sometimes she’d ask questions and I’d answer, but she mostly just listened. I got the feeling that she didn’t know much about the modern world, since most of her questions consisted of asking what things were, such as television or electronic fans when they came up in conversation. Computers were especially hard for me to explain to her, and by the end of my jumbled explanation I wasn’t sure if she actually understood what I was saying or was just pretending to.\n   \nI stopped asking too many questions about herself however. She didn’t explicitly say it, but I got the feeling she didn’t like talking about herself, and any replies for when I did ask were usually short.\n   \nA week and a half was all it took for my Father to let Dale back over to the house. My Father had pulled me aside and said, “Look. I know what your Uncle did made you uncomfortable, but I think it was really all a big misunderstanding. He explained it to me and he really didn’t mean any harm, he just didn’t realize it would make you uncomfortable since he just doesn't get kid's stuff. He wants to apologize, so he’s coming over tomorrow.”\nMy heart sank. I immediately tried to protest but my Father stopped me.\n   \n“If you don’t like it then you can just avoid him alright? But at the end of the day he's family.”\n   \nAnd that’s exactly what I did. Apparently Dale came over the next day but I didn’t see him since I was outside until dark with Miss Sarah. I came home to find a stuffed cat plush with a bow on it on the table, a handwritten letter that said *to Lace, my sweetheart* beside it. I threw both in the trash. Dale continued to come over after that, and I continued to avoid him. The few times I did happen to run into him, he kept apologizing and trying to “make up” with me. I was polite to him so my Father wouldn’t get upset, but I always managed to slip away back to the forest.\n   \n As much as I loved Miss Sarah, I still had many questions about her. She practically knew my entire life, but I knew next to nothing about her. Despite trying to avoid personal questions I decided to just be forward about it.\n      \n“How’d you end up out here Miss Sarah?”\n   \nI expected her to get mad or grow cold, but she never did. I wasn’t sure why I was expecting that, since Miss Sarah had never gotten angry at me before. Instead of her usual terse replies, she began to talk more than I’d ever heard her talk before. She told me about her life, way before. She told me how she used to live on a plantation way on the other end of the swamp. It was a long time ago, and she admittedly doesn’t remember much. She just remembers it was a miserable place. However, she did remember how she died. The plantation owner’s son dragged her into the swamp and raped her, then beat her into a broken mess.\n   \n“I laid there for a long time then.” She recalled. “Until the bugs began to eat away at my skin and my body began to sink into the earth. But my mind had not quite left, just slept. I lay dormant until bits of me began to slowly reassemble.” \n   \nMiss Sarah likened it to a broken mirror that had been glued back together. She was like before, but now fundamentally different. I didn’t completely understand it but I accepted it anyway. \n      \nThe next morning I was in the kitchen fixing myself some leftover corn dogs and thinking about Miss Sarah. She had made my life so much less dreary these past couple of weeks and her story saddened me. I thought about what it meant to be family. She wasn’t blood but, could we really become a family? \n   \nA sudden jab pinched both my sides and I shrieked, dropping the box of frozen corn dogs. I whipped around and there stood Dale, looking down at me and smiling.\n   \n“Tickle fight!”\n   \n“GET AWAY FROM ME!”\n   \n“Come on, don’t be like that.”\n   \nI jumped back like a feral animal and nearly snarled at him, heart beating like crazy.\n   \nHe frowned.\n   \n“I’m just having fun with you! I’m just being an Uncle, ok? Come on, tickle!” \n   \n“Leave me alone!” \n   \nHe ignored me and came forward, arms outstretched and laughing playfully. It was anything but playful to me, and I screamed and shouted at him to stop as he started chasing me around the living room. He just laughed at my cries and continued swooping at me until I shouted,\n   \n“I’m telling Dad! I’m telling him what you're doing!”\n   \nHe dropped his hands and looked annoyed.\n   \n“I’m just playing! Come on, there’s nothing wrong with it.” He took another step.\n  \n“I’m telling! I’m *telling!*”\n   \n“God- Stop being such a brat. I’m just-”\n   \n“Get away!” \n   \n“Come here!”\n   \nHe swooped at me faster this time and grabbed my wrist before I could dodge him. He looked surprised. \n   \n“Let go!” I wailed, twisting helplessly. He watched me struggle for a few seconds, realizing I couldn’t pull away from his grasp. Then he grinned. I bit his hand.\n   \nHe immediately yelped and retracted his hand, the sudden movement sending me sprawling to the floor. My bite was deep enough to make his hand start gushing with blood. His face turned to rage. \n   \n“You bitch! You fucking bitch!” He tried to come after me but I was already halfway out the door, adrenaline pushing my legs as fast as they could.\n   \n“Come back you you fucking whore!\"\n\nI sprinted blindly through the forest, tears blurring my vision. I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t care, I just needed to get as far away as possible. My emotions kept bubbling up to the surface and I tried to drown them with my running. I ran for an indeterminate amount of time until I saw Sarah in the distance. I threw myself onto her and burst into tears, everything that had just happened exploding out of me. I’m sure she must have been surprised, but she took me and sat down with me, stroking my hair as I wept and rambled disjointedly. She let me hug her like that for a while, pouring my soul out to her.\n   \n“Oh Sarah what am I going to do? He’s going to do something to me soon, I know it. It’ll be worse. I-I don’t want to go back. I’m scared, I’m scared… oh Sarah…”\n   \nShe cupped my sniffling face in her hands and brought it up to hers, looking at me lovingly. \n   \n“It’s time to go hunting.”\n\n..\n\nI didn’t go back home until the dead of night. By that time Dale was gone, thankfully. I didn’t sleep well that night, and many thoughts swirled fitfully in my mind. The next morning, I came downstairs to see my Father and Dale watching T.V together in the living room. Dale’s eyes followed me as I went to the kitchen to make myself some cereal. \n   \n“Mornin.” He called out naturally to me.\n   \n“Morning.” I said.\n   \nConsidering Dad didn’t scream at me first thing in the morning, and the fact that Dale was wearing a long sleeved shirt even though it was the summer, it seemed that he hadn’t mentioned our little fight to Dad. I guess it would be more trouble than it was worth to try and twist what happened and make it seem like it was my fault again. He probably was afraid Dad might hear my side of the story this time. Either way it worked in my favor.\n   \nI took my bowl and plopped down on the recliner. Dale looked surprised. Usually I ate in the kitchen and left as soon as possible, wanting to spend as little time as I possibly could near  him. I paid Dale no mind and pretended to be interested in the T.V. I took a bite of my cereal. I could barely taste it.\n   \nAfter I finished my cereal I slunk off the couch, put my bowl in the sink, and casually walked outside, taking a few steps before leaning against the side of the house. It was a good spot. It was far enough away that I could have a private conversation without Dad hearing from inside, but close enough he could still hear me if I shouted.\n   \nA minute later, I heard Dale get up, mumbling something I think was about needing to take a piss. He walked outside and spotted me, a slick smile growing on his face. Anxiety plunged into my stomach.\n   \n*If I scream, Dad will hear me. If I scream, Dad will hear me. If I scream-*\n   \n“Hey Sweetheart, whatcha doin’ out here?”\n   \nI swallowed. “Hey Dale.”\n   \n“Nice of you to join us in the living room this mornin.”\n   \nI looked over at the hand of his I bit. The bitemark wasn’t fully hidden by his sleeve. He noticed me looking and put his hand up to his chest.\n   \n“About yesterday, I know-”\n   \n“I’m sorry.” I blurted.\n   \n“What?”\n   \n“I’m sorry Dale. I knew you were just playing. I shouldn’t have done that. It was wrong and I’m sorry, I- I really am…” \n   \nHe looked surprised, but then his smile grew wider. It reminded me of a cat after it’s caught its prey.\n   \n“Oh Sweetheart, it’s alright. I forgive you.”\n   \n“N-no, it’s not. I-I know I was wrong to do that. I should have been… more understanding. It must have hurt right?” \n   \n“It hurt a lot, it really did. I couldn’t even sleep last night ‘cause of the pain. Did you know that kissing a booboo makes-”\n   \n“I want to make it up to you. I um, I made you a gift. It’s special. Are you babysitting tonight?”\n   \n“Of course I am.”\n   \n“Good. I’ll give it to you then. Oh, but it’s uh, the gift, you can’t tell anyone about it. Since it’s special. Not even Dad. I… it’s a special surprise, only for you, you know? And you’ll have to wait ‘till it’s dark for it. You understand?”\n\nI was terrified he’d notice how off my voice sounded, but instead he just nodded, eyes lighting up in understanding. His grin grew wider and he looked me up and down. I wanted to scream, but I held it in.\n   \n“That’s wonderful. I can’t wait, Sweetie.”\n\n..\n\nAs the sky started turning into a wash of orange and red, like clockwork, Dad got up and stretched, ready to head for the bar.\n   \n“Be back.” He grumbled, grabbing his keys.\n   \n“Have a good time. Here- treat yourself tonight.”\n   \nDale pulled out some cash from his slimy jeans and handed it to him. \n   \nDad smiled. “Thanks Dale.”\n  \nDisgust filled my stomach. I’m sure Dad thought Dale was just being a kind older brother, but I knew his real intention. He wanted him gone as long as possible for tonight.\n   \nHe walked Dad out and waved him off as he left for the bar, then came back in.\n   \nThe look he had when he came back in made me want to run right then and there. He was grinning from ear to ear, looking as if he was finally about to eat a piece of dessert he’d been saving for a while.\n   \n“Sweetheart…” He cooed, coming closer to me, like a panther slowly zeroing in on his prey, positioning itself for the pounce.\n   “Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart…”\n    \nI jumped up from the couch. “Your present! I need to give your present!” I nearly shrieked, trying to subdue the panic in my voice.\n   \n“It’s outside! Remember, in the woods, I told you. W-we need to go out and get it.”\n   \nHe stopped, looking amused. “Alright then Sweetheart, if you want to do it that way, I’ll play ball.”\n   \nHe quickly grabbed my hand, forcing his fingers to interlock with mine. I resisted the urge to yank it away.\n   \n“Lead the way.”\n   \nAnxiety coursing through my insides, I led him outside and we started heading towards the tree line. Unfortunately however, the yard was long and Dale was impatient. As we walked, he started rubbing his thumb against the backside of my hand.\n   \n“Can I have my present now?” He said, yanking me back as we were almost across the yard.\n   \n“No!” I said, yanking forward. “Wait we're almost there!”  \n   \n*I have to get past the tree line, I have to get the tree line.* Sarah warned me that her domain only reached as far as the tree line.\n   \n“I want my present now.” He said, continuing to grab at me.\n   \n“Please!” I said, the panic now clear in my voice.\n   \n“Don’t be so difficult.” His tone was demanding.\n   \nWe struggled right at the edge of the yard, and our steps grew fewer and fewer. Terror enveloped me and tears sprung from my face as I twisted helplessly. Just as Dale grabbed my hair I heard it.\n   \nIt was the sound of my mother’s voice singing.\n   \nThe tone was low, unearthly and beautiful. An old rendition of a nursery rhyme my mother used to sing me as I fell asleep. Sarah, in the form of my mother and dressed in her old flower dress, stood a few yards away. The light of the now rising moon illuminated her figure through the gap in the trees, making her look ethereal. \n   \nDale stared at her transfixed before letting go of my hair. Then his face erupted into the most disgusting smile I have ever seen.\n   \n“Hey there Sweetheart, whatcha doin out so late?” He said, but he wasn’t talking to me. He was staring at Sarah. Sarah didn’t respond, just continued to quietly hum her beautiful tune.\n   \n“Does your Mommy know you’re out here so late?... Sweetheart, where are your clothes?”\n   \nHe took off his shirt and eagerly started walking towards her.\n   \n“Put this on Sweetheart, it’s chilly. How old are you? It isn’t safe for you out here you know. Come here, don’t worry. I’ll help you....”\n   \nHe wrapped this arm around Sarah’s waist. Sarah grabbed his arm and started leading him into the woods. Before she did however, she looked back at me. Her brown eyes shone almost gold in the moonlight. They were cold, predatory looking. Her face looked inhuman and feral. It sent shivers down my spine. As close as we were, right now I felt as if she could seriously harm me if I approached her. It was time for me to leave. I ran back to the house and locked the door. Then I went into my room and hid under my covers, shivering like a baby animal...\n   \nDale didn’t come back the next day. Or the next, or the next, or the next. Dad started to get worried. He eventually called the police. As the last person to see him alive I was asked multiple times by both Dad and the police about what happened that night. I adamantly stuck to my story that Dale and I had watched T.V together until I went to bed, and I hadn’t seen him after that. I was terrified they’d catch on that I was lying, but they didn’t press me too much. After all, it’s not like a ten year old kid would be involved with a disappearance case. The investigation never ended up getting anywhere.\n   \nI only asked what happened to Dale once, mostly out of nervousness the police would find him and somehow connect it back to us. Miss Sarah just smiled.\n   \n“Made into fun little chunk sizes…”\n   \nIt’s been years now since that incident. I started school at the end of that summer, eventually graduated, and I’m now married with kids. That summer felt so long but now it feels as if time breezes by. I’m still in contact with my Dad but I keep the relationship at a distance. Ever since Dale died he’s been the same, but worse. He sits alone in his house all day, quietly drinking or leaving for the bar, no other joys or missions in life. I do feel a bit of pity for him, but it’s his life. As for Miss Sarah, we still keep in contact regularly. \n\nMy family and I live on the opposite side of the swamp so my Husband and kids get to see her fairly often. When I first introduced my Husband to her when we first got engaged. I was quite nervous, but he accepted her existence pretty well, and she, his. That’s when I knew he was the one. Usually I bring a picnic basket and we all have a nice lunch together while the children play. Just like when I was little I like to tell her about my day and she still listens, quietly and contently. \n\nMiss Sarah may not be my mom, but she will always be my family.",

        "text": "I know how this might sound to some of you. “Here we go again, with one of those conspiracy freaks from the depths of the Internet” – and you’d be right to think that. I’ve seen my fair share of nonsense online, but I can promise all of you that I’m telling the truth, or at least I’m telling you all what I think I saw. I don’t know if I was drunk or high or some crazy shit like that, but if there’s even a small chance that what I saw was real, then we are all in grave danger. Let’s get formalities out of the way.\n\nMy name is Hank Beauregard, Ph.D. I studied astrophysics and astronomy at the University of Minnesota from 2007 to 2011, and I now work at an observatory in Texas. My job’s not as glamorous as it sounds; mainly my colleagues and I sit around plugging data into automated programs at local observatories and reading over photographs taken overnight. I mean, the pay’s decent, and the subject matter is pretty interesting.\n\nOver the past three or four years, my team and I have been studying a set of dwarf galaxies in close proximity to our own, occasionally discovering new stars or more detailed regions of the night sky. So far, we’ve discovered at least a dozen subsections of the galaxies orbiting the Milky Way – another step in analyzing the observable universe. But enough about my work – if you’re still here, you probably want to hear about what I witnessed.\n\nAround a week ago, I was examining a set of images aimed at a matrix of irregular galaxies not far from our own, when I noticed something was off about them. The entirety of the Carina Dwarf galaxy was gone, and a decent portion of the Magellanic Clouds was missing.\n\nI was bewildered, to say the least. From what I know, there’s no phenomenon that could just block off a whole cluster of stars like that. Even if it was a large planet, each star would have simply appeared a little dimmer than before, and there’s no chance that all of them went nova – the colossal release of energy would have destroyed our planet. And besides, there’s no way so many stars could have detonated at once.\n\nClearly, something had happened to these galaxies to have blocked them off from view – or, if it was even possible – to have removed them entirely. I hadn’t seen anything like this since I learned about the Boötes Void – a dark, generally empty region of space roughly 700 million light years from Earth. I passed the images off to my colleagues, but they had just as much of an explanation.\n\nA couple days went by, and we received yet more images from the Hubble telescope, and to our surprise – even more of the Magellanic Clouds had gone missing, lost to whatever mysterious force had claimed it. Fellow astrophysicists and I were in a frenzy. No known phenomenon in the entire universe could produce this enigma– let alone spread faster than the speed of light itself. Perplexed and unnerved, we consulted our partners over in Houston, who even then couldn’t give us an explanation.\n\nWe watched in horror as the Large Magellanic Cloud was devoured by unknown jaws, as the stars before our very eyes disappeared without a trace. Whatever happened to those stars was spreading, and at far beyond the speed of light. The rules of our world, no, our universe were being rewritten before our very eyes. My colleagues and I started to formulate theories as to what was going on up there. Perhaps the starlight was being obscured by some exotic phenomenon, like dark matter or some strange, unknown form of energy.\n\nMaybe we had just seen signs of an advanced alien civilization whose spacecraft somehow achieved interstellar travel. These creatures could have been feeding on the stars they touched, absorbing their mass and energy into a larger structure, like a Dyson Sphere or a Matrioshka Brain, or perhaps some other megastructure we hadn’t even thought of yet! In any case, what we saw in those pictures was beyond anything we ever knew, or probably will ever know. Some members of the lab got so desperate that now they’re even praying, asking for forgiveness from a god who has clearly abandoned us.\n\nYesterday, I looked up at the night sky, remembering how, as a child, I’d stare into the heavens and wonder about the endless possibilities space held for humankind. But in the end, I was gravely mistaken. Our first glimpse of the universe’s true potential was not a stellar adventure among the stars. It was not some space opera, where daring crewmembers of an advanced, futuristic ship made landfall on an exotic world. This was real, and it was terrifying.\n\nI’ve already shoehorned in the inexplicability of this phenomenon, but to be honest it’s all I can think about, how we barely scratched the surface of what really lies in the cosmic abyss. For now, all I can do is wait for it to reach the Milky Way and engulf us, or destroy us, or whatever the hell it has planned for our world. Whatever it is, it will be here soon – based on the distance from the Carina galaxy to our own, the events we witnessed happened just over 8,500 years ago – before recorded human civilization even existed. I’m sure laboratories and amateur astronomers around the world are starting to see the slight differences in our view. I’m sure major news outlets will be brimming with anxious news anchors by next week, spreading the story further and causing panic. I’m just here to warn you about what will come next.\n\nLive life as best you can. Embrace your family and friends. Take that trip you were planning all those years back. Ask out that cute boy a couple lockers down. Do it all now, because it won’t be long until this anomaly reaches our world. We can already see stars fading around the outer Sagittarius-Carina arm of the Milky Way, and we’ve predicted that at the rate the stellar blackout is spreading, it will be upon our world in approximately 58 years and two months. I have to go for now, but I’ll keep you posted. Stay safe and do what you can to enjoy your lives. And for those stargazers out there, don’t be surprised when you see some changes in the heavens – because the night sky looks different tonight.",

        "text": " \n\nFor some this story might sound FAKE but i am sure what I saw.\n\nI'm a car mechanic from Toledo, Ohio i was visiting family in Lakewood Colorado when i drove trough a forest at around 2:15 AM. I left my home late so i knew i would need to drive trough the night but i didn't expect do need to drive a 2 hour detour because of road works. What the hell kinda road works need a 2 hour detour, i didn't think much of it anyways. I should have arrived at my parents house at around 9 AM but i didn't make it and this is why.\n\nIt was 1:56 AM when i drove past a sign that read: \"beware animals might cross road unexpected\" by that I knew i would be driving trough a forest or a field. About 10 minutes later I arrived at the entrance of the forest and once again there was the same sign that said: \"beware animals might cross road unexpected\" so i made sure to turn on my fog lights so i would see if an animal crossed the road.\n\nI drove half an hour trough the forest and it was still going i thought in myself: 'damn this is a big forest when is it going to end' then suddenly my headlights went out so i pulled over and got out of my car. since i'm a mechanic i thought i could fix it myself, I opened the hood of my car and saw that the cable was disconnected, it must have happened when i hit a bump the cable was probably loose. I connected the cable again but the lights didn't turn back on, oh yeah the engine isn't on so i turned the key but nothing happened it didn't even make a starting noise. Dammit i guess i'l call my parents and tell them i will be late and then call a cab.\n\nI had 0 cell service so there was no calling and i didn't know how long to walk until there was an end to this forest and i am not walking in the night, I guess i'l sleep in the car until morning and then walk to the nearest gas station. I was about to get into my car when I heard a howl close by, crap i don't have time for this. I ran towards my trunk where i had an AR 15 stored (don't ask me why I had an AR 15 in my trunk i had my reasons) it was dark so i couldn't see 5 feet in front of me so i duck taped my flashlight to the barrel of my gun so i could see where the wolves were, then i saw it we stared in each others eyes when it ran towards me and i fired 5 times every shot landed in its head and i fell down in front of my feet. i nudged it with my muzzle to see if it was still moving but it wasn't so i was ready to get back into my car when i heard a moose and that's weird because there aren't moose's in Missouri, I didn't know if it was aggressive or not and i wasn't risking it so i got into my car and kept my eyes wide open.\n\nThen i saw it but it wasn't a moose it was something else it was like a shadow a human silhouette, so i got out of my car and aimed my rifle and turned on my flashlight but I still couldn't see what it was i told it to come closer so I could see it better but it had no face no anything it was like a shadow then it ran towards me so i shot it 3 times but it kept running the bullets went trough the shadow and into the tree behind it so i started running into the forest, I'm a pretty fast runner so i thought I lost it.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of walking i found a deserted camping i was used to camping out in deserted buildings because of my time in the marines that's why i shot the wolf so accurate if you were wondering I sat their on a chair what felt for hours but it was probably just minutes that is when I heard that moose again there was noway i was falling for that again so i flipped a table took cover behind it and aimed my rifle at the door.\n\nWaiting about 10 minutes and i heard a stick break so I knew it was the mysterious entity it opened the door and I dumped my mag in it but it didn't even get hit, once again all the bullets went right trough him. It ran towards me and I closed my eyes i knew it was over. Let me tell you one thing, in the movies and stories before you die your life flashes before your eyes but it doesn't. I was surprised when i woke in my with my rifle next to me, maybe it was a dream i checked my mag but all the bullets were missing so i did shoot them all, it was only then when i realized that i wasn't in a forest but it was in the same spot I left it in even my hood was still open and the wolf was like before laying next to my car. Weird\n\nMy car did eventually start again and i called my parents saying i couldn't make it, I drove home and decided to tell my story.\n\nTHE END.",

        "text": "My name is Danny, and I'm writing this from a hospital bed. I was in a coma since the night of December 23rd, having woken up yesterday.\n\nThe first thing I heard was my mum screaming for the nurse, which scared the hell out of me. Then she sternly told me I'd missed Christmas, like she held a grudge. Then she cried. A nurse told me she'd been by my side every day since I was admitted, even Christmas day. Apparently my dad and brothers cooked Christmas dinner. Really wish I could have seen that! Maybe not eaten it though, knowing their kitchen skills.\n\nI'll get to that damned tower soon, but first I'll explain why I'm afraid of heights. I was eight years old, and our family home then was a flat on the second floor of a five-storey block. The building needed some external maintenance, so a construction company came to put up some scaffolding. It surrounded the whole building. For a kid, it was essentially a giant climbing frame.\n\nTemptation got the better of my best friend Reuben and I. The danger-red ***WARNING*** signs dotted around the frame only encouraged our determination to scale the building. That, and being at an age where secretly defying our parents was the best kind of naughty. We'd both been told we were not to climb the scaffolding under any circumstances. So naturally, we did.\n\nWe avoided areas that had windows, just in case we were spotted. On the parts where it was impossible to go any further without passing a window, we'd crawl on the wooden planks to stay low. When someone walked by the building, we laid completely flat to stay out of sight, covering our mouths to stifle the giggles.\n\nAfter a few days we felt courageous enough to reach the highest level of the wooden walkways. Don't get me wrong; it was scary being that high. But it was also exciting! We sat on the edge of the planks and dared each other to look down. But then Reuben suggested something that made me feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"Wanna hang?\" he asked with a smirk. He was standing very close to the edge, leaning over and holding onto one of the parallel rails for support.\n\nI shook my head. \"No way, Roo. Don't be stupid!\"\n\n\"Come on, Danny. Don't be a scaredy-cat…\"\n\nHe pretended to lose his footing which made my heart pound, but then he grinned.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" I said, taking a deep breath. \"I think it's time to head back down. We might get found out!\"\n\n\"No one's gonna know we're up here, Danny. We're too high…\"\n\nIt was as if Reuben tempted fate, because almost as soon as he'd finished talking, there came a booming voice from just below us.\n\n\"Get down from there, you darned fools!\"\n\nIt was cranky old Mr Woods who lived on the top floor, shouting out of his window. His outburst startled us. It was enough to make Reuben slip, for real this time. He ended up clinging onto the rail a few feet away from the edge, nothing but a five- storey drop below him.\n\n“Danny, help me!” he yelled. “Pull me back!”\n\nI froze. It was momentary, but when I actually took the steps to help, one of his hands lost its grip.\n\n“Roo!” I screamed. I had just enough time to see the shocked look on his face as he fell out of sight.\n\nI never saw the impact. I fell to my knees, collapsed onto my back, and stared up at the sky in a daze. Mr Woods was shouting, but I couldn’t tell you a word of what he said. I'm not sure how long I was there, but I heard screams, and then sirens.\n\nIt was my dad who came to get me. I have a vague memory of him passing me down from the highest planks to the ones below, Mr Woods’ arms reaching up to grab me.\n\nI didn’t talk for a few days after that.\n\nThe thing about fear of heights (acrophobia) is that even the thought of being at a great height can be triggering. Images too. For example, that scene in one of the *Mission: Impossible* films where Tom Cruise scales the Burj Khalifa; I had to stare into my popcorn and ask a friend to let me know when it was over. I felt a wave of vertigo and panic threatening to take over my body.\n\nI can avoid most things that cause these reactions. If I have to visit big cities, I’ve trained myself to keep my eyes low. I can use escalators if I keep my head down. Lifts are generally fine as long as I know the doors won’t open to large windows. Glass lifts on the other hand; absolutely not. I can visit friends who live in apartments above ground floor, I just avoid windows. I can even fly if I have to. Give me an aisle seat and a xanax, I’ll get through it.\n\nThe experience changed my life significantly. Not only with my aversion to heights, but the guilt I carry. I was just a kid, but rarely a week goes by without me feeling somewhat responsible for Reuben's death.\n\nThis leads me to the night of December 23rd. It was my family’s annual pre-Christmas get together at a restaurant out of town. It’s about an hour's drive from me; on a good day! We had snow in my part of the UK, so that added a little extra time to my journey. I absolutely hate driving in those conditions, but I'll do it if I have to.\n\nOne thing about that journey is the road passes a tall transmitting tower. It's hard to avoid looking at it for parts of the journey as it's directly on the horizon, though I try my best to pay it no mind. It's an imposing structure that never fails to accelerate my heart rate.\n\nIt seems the tower is always shrouded in a light mist. It makes its appearance all the more ominous. I don't think I've ever clearly seen the top of it. With the snowfall we had that day, I barely saw the tower at all on my drive up. But the red lights that line it could be seen through the flurry, and that was enough to send a shiver down my spine.\n\nIt was already dark when I said my goodbyes to my family and started my journey back home. I was grateful that the snow wasn't as heavy by that point, but still drove with caution. My radio was off as I didn't want any distractions. There were a string of headlights behind me for a lot of the journey. I imagined the drivers swearing about my reserved speed.\n\nTurning a corner, the tower lights became visible. My heart skipped an inevitable beat as I shifted my gaze to the road ahead, but those lights were a constant glare in my peripheral vision.\n\nThen, I heard a voice.\n\n*\"Danny.\"*\n\nIt was breathless; just above a whisper, but clear.\n\nI slammed my foot on the brakes, skidding on the road for several metres before my car came to a stop. The car behind me managed to swerve, avoiding a collision. The driver held down the horn as they passed, and several other cars followed.\n\nMy hands were shaking. It took me a few minutes before I felt composed enough to move the car, which was at an angle. My foot trembled on the accelerator, but I managed to reach a lay-by where I parked up. I stepped outside, the cold night air biting at my skin and throat as I breathed in.\n\nI sat on the hood as I tried to make sense of what I heard. It was probably just the wind and I imagined the rest, something like that. I looked into the sky. The light snow falling onto my face was incredibly sobering. I managed a laugh.\n\n\"You fucking idiot,\" I chuckled to myself as I stepped away from the car. I took the opportunity to relieve myself behind a bush, grateful I hadn't pissed my Levi's. I continued to chuckle as that old saying *don't eat yellow snow* came to mind. Then just as I was making my way back to the car, the voice came again.\n\n*\"Danny.\"*\n\nThere was no denying it this time. My feet gave way and I fell backwards. It was like my name travelled on the wind. I barely had time to acknowledge the fear that gripped me before realising exactly where I was.\n\nLooming over me were a row of vertical red lights, disappearing into the snowy night sky. My hands began to clench, snow compacting within my fists. My heart stopped as a siren blared somewhere high above. It was like the sirens you hear in movies set during the blitz. There was no doubt it was coming from the top of the tower.\n\nIt was calling me.\n\nI stood up and blinked away snowflakes from my eyelashes. Despite the cold, I felt perspiration all over my body. That familiar feeling of dread was heavy in my stomach. And yet, I found myself walking back to my car for my woollen beanie and gloves. I left my phone in the glove box and locked the doors, putting the keys in the inside pocket of my parka jacket.\n\nMy winter boots crunched in the snow as I walked towards the tower. There was no time to appreciate the beauty of the untouched white fields and dusty trees. My heart was racing, stuttered exhales of breath visible for seconds before dispersing.\n\nThe siren continued to blare until I reached a small building in the vicinity of the tower, where it abruptly stopped. The whole area was bathed in a red glow. As I approached the tower, a ladder within the frame became visible. My hands gripped a rung, which felt ice cold even through my gloves.\n\nI took a few deep breaths and slowly looked up. The red lights appeared to have no end. I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.\n\n*\"Help me, Danny.\"*\n\nMy eyes shot open as the words echoed from above. It sounded just like…\n\nThe closest light, maybe 20 feet away, began to glow with ferocity. I had to look away, momentarily blinded as if looking directly at the sun. I could hear the intense buzz of electricity, and squinted as I turned my head to look up.\n\n*\"DANNY!\"*\n\nThe voice screamed my name as the light exploded, showering sparks over me. My arms covered my face as I cowered in the snow. When I eventually turned back, one by one the remaining lights on the tower began to glow a little brighter, as if inviting me to follow them. I stood up, grasping the ladder again.\n\n\"Lord, give me strength,\" I said out loud in an attempt at self motivation, having never believed in a higher power. I took a sharp intake of breath, held it for a few seconds, then began to ascend the ladder.\n\nTo begin with, it was one rung at a time at a snail's pace. I'd take a step upwards; left foot first, then meet it with my right. Pause, then repeat. I had no concept of time, and can only go by how long it felt. All I can tell you is after what felt like at least 5 minutes, I was barely 10 feet from the ground from my very quick glance down.\n\nThankfully, the position of the ladder meant that no snow had built up on the rungs. Though I was conscious of ice. The thermometer in the car put it at -3°C, and some of the rungs had a shimmering surface.\n\nAs I passed the destroyed light, I was managing to step up to the next rung immediately without meeting the other. I counted roughly five seconds between each rung. By the time the first working light became close enough to touch, I was climbing a little faster. There was slight heat radiating from it, so I stopped to enjoy the subtle warmth it provided.\n\nI hooked my right arm around a bar and slowly looked down. The ground was barely visible now the lowest light source was gone, but visible enough to gauge how high I was. My head spun and my legs threatened to buckle, my left foot slipping on the rung in the process.\n\nMy scream reverberated within the tower's structure. For a brief moment, both of my feet left the ladder. My right arm, still hooked over the rung, took my body weight and stopped me from falling. There was a dull pain in my shoulder that was almost forgotten about instantly as I regained my footing. My breathing was as dramatic as you can imagine.\n\n\"Don't look down, don't look down,\" I said over and over like a mantra, closing my eyes and willing my head to clear. Once I could focus again, I winced. It felt like I'd pulled a muscle.\n\nSome 30 or so minutes later, I passed five lights. They were situated no more than 2 ft away from the left side of the ladder. I estimated there was around 20 ft between each one, which meant I was likely more than 100 ft from the ground by that point. Daring to only take quick glances down, I could no longer see the ground. If it hadn't been snowing it would have been different. I could only see the illumination of the lower lights. If I looked to the side, I could see the distant headlights of cars on the road.\n\nI stopped counting the lights. I'd built up a little more confidence and was ascending quicker. I noticed the air was getting colder too, and appreciated the brief moments of warmth the lights provided.\n\nAround an hour into the climb, the siren blasted again. It was louder than before, confirming I was closer to the source. It made me jump, but I didn't slip. I paused and clung on to the ladder to compose myself. The closest light to me began to pulse.\n\n\"What now?\" I said, having let my guard down. I looked up at the snowflakes, which were shades of pink and red. All of the lights appeared to be pulsing. I silently prayed that none of them would explode again. Not only because of the injuries they could potentially cause me, but if those lights went out I would be in complete darkness.\n\n*\"Danny!\"* came that voice again, loud enough for me to hear it over the siren. It sounded distressed. *\"It's coming!\"*\n\nI looked up, frantically searching for something that couldn't be seen.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I screamed into the sky. \"What's coming?\"\n\n*\"Don't look back. Hurry!\"*\n\nThe siren stopped again. All I could hear for a short while was the breeze. It was eerily quiet. Then I could hear a faint, metallic sound below me. I felt goosebumps over my body as I tried not to look. I didn't want to look. But I had to.\n\nI could see the shape of something on the ladder below me. The snow didn't help but there was very clearly something there. And it was ascending.\n\nI turned back and started to climb faster, my feet slipping in my frenzy. I let out a yell before finding my footing. My gloves were holding me back; the fibres didn't grip the bars like bare hands would. I used my teeth to prise them away from my fingers, letting them fall.\n\nWhatever was below me was getting closer. I tried not to look, but I involuntarily took quick glances over my shoulder. I could make out long, skeletal arms reaching for the bars. It was breathing heavily and grunting as it climbed.\n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck!\" became my new mantra. My hands felt the startling cold of the icy bars, but gripped more securely. I noticed the pain in my shoulder more now that I was climbing with determination.\n\nIt grabbed my left foot and made a hissing sound. Screaming, I turned to see claws around my boot. They started to pierce through the material. I pulled upwards with all I had and felt it slip away from my foot.\n\nThe sudden difference in weight caused whatever it was to fall. I felt a moment of relief, but it grabbed on to one of the bars, forcing its body to slam into the tower. It sent a tremor through the frame, my knuckles white as I gripped the bars. A shriek pierced my ears as it continued to climb, its claws tapping on the rungs.\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" I screamed over my shoulder, my heart feeling like it would stop at any moment. As I began to ascend again, I noticed only one of the lights above me was flashing now. It was the second closest to me.\n\nBy the time I was level with the light, it was too bright to look at directly. I could hear the same intense buzz coming from within it, like the electronics were working overtime. It gave me an idea.\n\nThe thing on the ladder was screeching behind me, the vibrations through the tower's frame getting stronger. Despite that, I paused by the light, hooking both arms around the bars. My body trembled as I closed my eyes.\n\n\"Please, please work,\" I said under my breath, my face scrunched up while I waited for the inevitable. There came a shriek directly below me which made me scream, then I felt tight pressure around my left leg. The thing pulled down hard.\n\nHoping my arms would support me, I took my right foot away from the ladder and kicked downwards. It met some part of the thing's body, which made it shriek again. There was a sudden sharp pain in my right leg. I stared through the bars into the dark interior of the structure, grimacing as my arms struggled to hold on.\n\nAs I regained my footing, it grabbed the hood of my jacket. My left arm was pulled from the rung as I screamed out; not only from shock, but the pain in my right arm was excruciating.\n\nMy upper body was forced to twist around, and I saw it was some kind of… creature. Arms impossibly thin, clenched serrated teeth. Its head was about twice the size of mine with rough, textured skin. Its dark eyes reflected the red glow. It screamed in my face, breath putrid and warm. I matched its scream as my arm began to slip.\n\nThe heat radiating from the light became more intense. I could see the structure around me glowing brighter by the second, and the buzz became high pitched.\n\n*\"Look away!\"* commanded the voice.\n\nThen the light exploded.\n\nThe creature screamed as the blast threw it from the tower, taking a clawful of my hood with it. Its long arms flailed as it fell out of sight, covered by the falling snow. My body was forced to the right side of the tower as sharp fragments made contact with the left side of my face. The tower shuddered, the metal frame screeching like it was struggling to hold. I swung my body back, grimacing at the pain in my shoulder. I grabbed at one of the bars and shut my eyes tight, once again praying to no one in particular.\n\nAfter several minutes the vibrations stopped, and all I could hear was ringing in my ears. I took a few deep, visible breaths and began to climb the remainder of the tower. My whole body shivered as the temperature dropped considerably. The palms of my hands were sore, and my bootless left foot trembled on the rungs despite wearing thermal socks. There was an uncomfortable wet sensation around the top of my right boot, which I realised was blood. I had a quick look and saw several slashes on the right leg of my jeans.\n\nI eventually came to a platform which concluded my climb. It was wide enough for me to lay down, giving me a chance to rest. It felt like I'd been climbing for hours. There was a strong, ice-cold breeze. I could feel the tower swaying slightly as laid still.\n\nThere was a pole elevating another 20 or so feet from the top of the tower. At the top of the pole was another red light, and what looked like a large megaphone. The siren.\n\nThe gravity of the situation slowly became apparent. My goal had been to reach the top of the tower. Something had called me, and I felt obliged to do it. But for what? Panic started to set in.\n\n\"What do I do now?\" I asked out loud, sitting up and leaning against the safety rail. I took a closer look at my leg. There were three vertical cuts down the back of my calf. It didn't appear to be bleeding too much; I assumed the cold had helped with that. But just looking at it made it feel more painful.\n\nThere came a scream from below. It sounded like that fucking creature again. I quickly laid back down and hugged my body as I shivered. More screams seemed to echo within the structure. I slowly peeked over the edge of the platform, my hands gripping the sides. I could only see a few feet down, the majority of the tower shrouded in snow.\n\n\"Danny,\" came the voice, close this time. I turned back, and couldn’t believe my eyes. There was a small boy, arms and legs wrapped around the pole.\n\nIt was Reuben.\n\n\"Help me!\"\n\nI shook my head, my lips trembling.\n\n\"No… No no no,\" was all I could manage.\n\nThe siren blasted. There was a metallic screech as the bottom of the pole began to buckle, and tilted at an angle. Reuben screamed as it collapsed, falling like a cut-down tree. The platform shuddered as the pole hit the rail, the siren coming free and falling out of earshot. Reuben's legs slipped from the force, his arms barely making it around the pole.\n\n“Danny, help me!\" he yelled. “Pull me back!”\n\nI was taken back to my childhood. 8 years old, watching helplessly as my friend tried to hang on for his life. The majority of the pole was now horizontal over the edge of the tower. Reuben clung to it near the end, just before the light. I was frozen in place.\n\n\"You're not Roo,\" I said, my voice wavering. \"I don't know what you are, but you're not Roo. I watched you fall. Your parents mourned you. *I* mourned you. It haunted me for life!\"\n\nThe light revealed his fearful expression. His eyes burned into me.\n\n\"It's me, Danny,\" he pleaded. \"You're my best friend.\"\n\nMy heart broke. His little face was filled with terror. I had no idea what, or *how* it was. But I couldn’t just sit there and watch like a coward. So I began to crawl closer.\n\nAs I reached the pole, I placed a trembling hand on it. I felt it bend a little, but it otherwise felt secure.\n\n\"Just… Just hold on,\" I said, sliding my body on top of the pole like I was riding a broomstick. I used my arms to slowly pull myself closer to Reuben. I looked down for all of a few seconds, my brain reminding me that I was several hundreds of feet above the ground. I paused briefly to clear the nausea, then focused entirely on Reuben. \n\nOut of nowhere, the creature leapt in front of me, the pole bending down further. I screamed as I felt my body shift forward, having to tighten my grip. It wrapped a claw around one of Reuben's arms, then dangled him over the edge.\n\n\"What the fuck are you?\" I screamed out. It turned to me with soulless eyes as Reuben cried for help. Its rough skin barely covered its bones. Its thin arms must have been at least 4 ft long. It exhibited a strength far greater than it appeared to possess, holding Reuben at arm's length with no visible struggle.\n\n\"Don't let it drop me, Danny. Please!\"\n\n\"I don't know how!\" I cried. The pole was slowly bending at a terrifying angle, the metal threatening to snap at any moment. I slipped forward, barely feet away from the creature. It bared its teeth, appearing to smile.\n\nIt let go of Reuben. I had enough time to see his face turn to shock as he began to fall.\n\n\"Roo!\" I screamed, letting go of the pole and reaching out with both arms. My heart jolted as my legs spun. I would have fallen regardless, but the pole snapped completely. By the sound the creature made, it was taken off guard.\n\nThe cold stung my face as the tower lights flew by, and the wind howled in my ears. The creature was nowhere to be seen, but I saw Reuben through the snow. I reached him, and cried as I pulled him against my chest. He felt so warm.\n\nAs I started to lose consciousness, I remember thinking there was something quite poetic about going out that way, like it was always meant to be.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I woke up in this bed.\n\nI was found the next morning by the engineers who work at the transmitting tower, unconscious in the snow. There were questions, which I haven't been able to fully answer yet. My mum said there might be criminal damage charges brought against me, due to the condition of the tower. She's fighting my corner on that though, claiming it as preposterous due to my fear of heights. Though when I'm ready, she needs an explanation of how I ended up there with the injuries I sustained. I don’t know what I’m going to tell her. *My dead childhood best friend lured me there* sounds a little crazy.\n\nI'm being kept in hospital for a few more days, but at least I have my phone to keep me occupied. It was retrieved from my car, which is currently parked outside my parent's house. I’ve been asking myself, *Did you really climb that tower?* I Googled it. It’s actually called a guyed steel lattice mast. Wikipedia says that particular one is 1002 ft tall.\n\nThere’s no way I could fall that far and live to tell the tale. I didn’t break a single bone. I have wounds on the back of my right leg, which the doctor said looks like it was caused by a large wild animal. My right shoulder is sprained. I have small cuts on the left side of my face. My hands have signs of mild frostbite. That’s it.\n\nI could have happily told myself that the whole thing was a vision, or whatever you want to call it. But what about my injuries? What about the damage to the tower? What about the condition of my left boot, which was found torn a few metres away from the tower? Or the shredded hood of my jacket?\n\nGiven time, I could probably come up with logical answers to those things. But I have no answer for this last thing.\n\nA nurse handed me a card earlier today that had been left on the counter of reception. It just had *Danny* written on the envelope. As I’m the only Danny currently in the hospital, let alone on this ward, it was assumed to be for me. When I opened it, my stomach dropped.\n\nThe front of the card depicted an illustration of the tower against a dark blue sky. Snow was falling, and two small boys looked happy building a snowman. To the left of the tower were what appeared to be the skull and bones of a large creature.\n\nUpon closer inspection, there was something odd about the snowman's arms. They weren't the traditional sticks usually used, and they were too long in proportion to the rest of its body.\n\nI held my breath as I opened the card. The message inside was simple, in the crude handwriting of a child:\n\n*Thank you*\n\n*R*",

        "text": " I lived in that house about two years and nothing utterly fucked up happened until this autumn. I moved there initially to work on my novella - a sort of action, fantasy, romantic drama about two trees planning a very slow heist on a logging company. Moving out into a forest felt like the next step to really understanding my protagonists’ rage. Sinking all of my savings into buying a house in the middle of nowhere felt like the next step to becoming a true artiste.\n\nAt first, I didn’t regret it. They call the area I live in a temperate rainforest, but that doesn’t do it justice. Even the sunlight here is green, trees bunched so close together sometimes it feels like you’re walking through twilight in the middle of the day, and the *peace*. There’s no other quiet like this on earth. There is a town, near where I live, big enough for a school and a police station and a road back to civilization. It’s mainly a fueling station for backpackers. We get a little tourist season in the summer, and you can’t really blame them for wanting to be here. I love it here. \n\nOr I did. Before the deer. \n\nIt was a normal morning. I made coffee, spent thirty-five minutes writing - which mostly consisted of staring at the screen but I did realize everything I’d written the day before was utter trash, so that’s kind of progress- and then decided to take a walk and come at things again with a fresh start. It was a nice day. The evergreens were, well, green, but there was a bit of autumn color on some of the leaves outside. The air was just starting to get cold. Even before I left the house I caught a faint, horrible smell - like a backed-up public toilet made of rotting vegetables. The source was a deer on my front porch. Or rather, the entrails of a deer on my front porch, which were rather more *out* than both I and the deer would have preferred. \n\n“Oh, god,” I said, jumping back into my house. Then, for good measure, “*Oh, god.* Oh, god!”\n\nBut god had been and gone and the deer was very dead. I won’t bore you with details about the guts and blood except to say that you don’t realize how much blood and guts a single animal can hold until they are casually draining out of it and onto your front porch.\n\nThe wild corpse disposal guys - always a treat to discover a new and exciting occupation in your area - thought maybe the deer had gotten away from a bear in the woods and staggered to my front porch before dying sometime last night. I didn’t take my walk that day. Strangely, the idea of a hungry bear searching the woods for his lost meal put me off. Instead, I covered my porch with vinegar and baking soda to try and get rid of the smell and developed a sudden appreciation for the vegan lifestyle. Still, the disposal guys did a decent job cleaning it up and it is the sort of thing you might expect once or twice, living in the wilds. It could be inspiration for a story. \n\nOnly the next day there was another deer. And the week after that, it was the bear.\n\nMost of the bear.\n\nSometimes it takes weeks between arrivals, sometimes it’s a day but on a regular unspecified schedule, I get a corpse on my front porch. I stopped calling the removal guys after the sixth body - they sent Jeff from the local police department to make sure I wasn’t hunting out of season. \n\n“So, to get this straight,” I said, “You think I’m hunting deer and bears and moose…ses and a tree that one time - ”\n\n“You need a license for logging in these parts, too,” Jeff said, and I ignored him.\n\n“ - With a chainsaw, I imagine, given the state of the bodies -”\n\n“Well, you would need a chainsaw for the logging.”\n\n“ - And then I drag my spoils to my own front porch, getting blood all over my wicker furniture, just so I can call Eavesdale Wild Animal Removal to take it away and burn it.”\n\n“They mostly bury the bodies,” Jeff said before my meaning sunk in. He stood in silence for a moment, starting at my porch, his tongue sweeping back and forth as if the explanation was stuck somewhere between his gums and upper lip. Finally he burst out, like he was having an epiphany, “It’s *weird*, though, isn’t it?”\n\nAfter that, I just started burying the bodies myself.\n\nOfficer Jeff was right, the bodies were weird. And they weren’t the only weird thing I noticed. I stopped walking, stopped writing, just stared out my bedroom window and I’ve *seen* things. The odd way the trees sway at dusk. Rumbling sounds, like thunder, only there’s no lightning anywhere nearby. Sometimes, late at night, there were odd lights and shadows in the forest. I know there’s shit I could have been doing. A camera would probably have caught it, I probably should have left the house or called for help. It’s not that I wasn’t scared. I was fucking terrified, but it was the kind of scared where I felt frozen. Like, if I put out a camera I’d see it and if I left I’d never know what it was and both options felt fucking horrifying so I just stocked up on bleach and goggles and plastic bags and took care of the bodies as they came. After a while it wasn’t even that gross, just a routine.\n\nAdmittedly the dead of winter was rough, but around the New Year, when the days got longer, I started to feel weirdly hopeful. I even hummed a little tune yesterday while I put on my improvised hazmat suit and checked the porch. I was prepared for a dead animal on my porch that day. There wasn’t one. Or, not really, like an animal, but a - human animal. A guy.\n\nThere was a dead guy on my porch. \n\nI did not bury him like the animals. I called the police because of fucking course I did, and Officer Jeff came over to nudge the body and lick under his lip some more. \n\n“Poor guy,” Jeff said, “He stopped off in town a few days ago for supplies. Seemed experienced enough. I think he was heading for the falls to ring in the New Year, must have run afoul of a bear or something.”\n\nI think I played it relatively cool when I begged him to let me stay in town. There was no hotel in town, but Jeff offered me his spare room. It was on the third floor of his tidy, flimsy little white-washed house and his wife Pamela kept up a running commentary while she made up the bed. Her voice was slow and mellow and I suspected it might have been for my benefit.\n\n“We’re gonna have lemon chicken for dinner, I hope you like lemon chicken. Sorry the bedpost is a little scratched up, we have a cat, only I bet you won’t see him. I hope you’re not allergic to cats. Gemma, our daughter, she loves that cat. She’s gonna have to do flute practice this evening, but it’s only for an hour after dinner. She can play Hot Cross Buns now, I hope you like Hot Cross Buns…”\n\nI wasn’t fully listening. The window of the bedroom faced out to the sliver of backyard and then, beyond it, the woods. It was midday, but the trees were so closely bunched together the forest faded into shadow, like it was stuck in perpetual twilight. The walls of the house felt painfully fragile. I felt Pamela step softly behind me.\n\n“Oh, isn’t it beautiful? Our little ones love playing out in those trees, don’t they Jeff? You know, I might send you all out to get some fresh air while I finish the lemon chicken.”\n\nI think I played it relatively cool by screaming, “No!” at the middle of my lungs instead of the top.\n\n“If you didn’t feel like lemon chicken, you should have just said so,” said Pamela.\n\n“Don’t be hurt, Pam,” said Jeff, “It’s just been a hell of a day and we’re both a little rattled. Let’s all stay inside for the afternoon, play some games. It sounds like there’s a storm brewing anyway.”\n\nI did my best to focus on Yahtzee and questions from Jeff’s kids and questions from Jeff as that afternoon wore into evening. “You know what I just realized?” Jeff said over a steaming plate of orange chicken and rice, “This is sort of like that problem you were having earlier with all the animals all gutted on your -”\n\n“Jeff!” Pam said, as she served one of the kids from a heaping bowl in the center of the table. There were six place settings and five of us - me, the couple, their two boys - were already seated. The girl - Gemma - wasn’t down yet from her room.\n\n“Well, it’s just a funny coincidence, that’s all. Isn’t it funny? Not funny haha, of course, but -”\n\n“Funny weird,” I smiled faintly. It was a weird coincidence now, but what was going to happen when backpacking season started in earnest? After the fifth body, Jeff might stop thinking it was funny weird and start thinking it was funny suspicious. I decided right then and there that I was going to get a camera. \n\n“It is weird,” Jeff said, “Because I have to say it, the guy looks exactly like those dead animals that turned up all gutted on your -”\n\n“Jeff!” Pamela said, as one of the kids retched, “That is enough talk about dead animals at the dinner table.” Gemma passed across the dining room doorway carrying a tied-up plastic bag just as Pamela finished scooping her own plate, “Gemma, what’s taking you so long?”\n\n“I can’t tell you,” Gemma said.\n\nPamela looked up, Jeff shook his head at me in commiseration, and I thanked god for pre-teen angst to change the topic. \n\n“Gemma Marie, are you keeping secrets from your mother?”\n\n“No, I *can’t* tell you.”\n\n“And why’s that?”\n\n“Because you just said not to talk about dead animals at the dinner table.”\n\nI did not play it cool. I shrieked at the very top of my lungs and fell fully out of my chair. The plastic baggie in Gemma’s hand did not look large enough to house a human body, but it had been a long day and I wasn’t exactly thinking straight.\n\n“It’s just a mouse,” Gemma said, through the open doorway behind her, I could see the trees and a small, resentful shadow slinking between them. \n\n“Baxter, you little scamp!” Pamela called after him, and the little cat turned, becoming a shadow with pinprick lamps for eyes. Baxter swished his tail and vanished between the trees, “I’m sorry about that. He’s an outdoor cat and he’s always bringing us his little gifts. Thinks he’s king of the forest, that one.”\n\n“It’s actually because he thinks we can’t feed ourselves,” said Gemma, “He just thinks we’re big stupid kittens who’ll starve without him.”\n\nLast night, I looked out into the trees from Jeff’s guest bedroom with a keener eye. The storm Jeff had predicted never arrived and so the night sky was clear and the full moon bore down, creating a twin pair of massive lights in the forest. I’m not sure how the beast knew where I was staying, but he’d found me. Those huge lantern eyes blinked and there was a sound like thunder and I know this sounds crazy.\n\nBut I think I have a new pet.\n\nAnd I need to convince him I don’t eat hikers.",

        "text": " I'm Cam. I have a nine-year-old kid, a sweet wife, and a job I love. It seems perfect. But as with everything this ideal, it didn't last long.\n\nOur marriage started failing with the birth of our son. As much as I don't want to admit it, she just wasn't the same after James. Something in her just.. disappeared. It has left a void that is now consuming her. She stopped cracking jokes or laughing, it has been ages since I've seen her smile. She just isn't the jovial and caring person I had married.\n\nShe stopped caring for James and was very cold towards him. Postpartum depression? Maybe, who knows? I've always tried being kind to her and to understand her but honestly, I'd be lying if I said I still love her new self as I loved her before.\n\nJames was such an adorable kid. He's so amenable and easy to handle! He never disobeyed me. We spent lots of time together, we go fishing every Saturday, we make snowmen(?lol) every time it snows and for some goddamn reason the name of the snowman is always just \"snow.\"\n\nToday morning though, she woke up and told me our son was possessed and was trying to kill her. For the first time in a million years, I saw emotion in her usually robotic face. I could see the fear in her eyes but then I looked at James. He looks so meek and timid.. he could never.\n\nIt took me two hours to reassure her that our son isn't trying to kill us. Well, she was never really convinced though-- she keeps looking at James every second they were in the same room. She completely stopped sleeping and talking, and she refused to eat with us. She was turning into a fucking zombie.\n\nI looked after James for three whole months, and nothing strange happened. Just when I thought she was loosening up a bit.. this happened.\n\nI was woken up by her wails, she was in the kitchen; with a knife in her hand and with James on the floor. Her eyes had a mixture of anger and fear that sent shivers down my spine. I felt like I was looking at a lion that was released from harrowing captivity. She was unhinged. She started breaking things and she just wouldn't stop yelling.\n\nShe slowly started to slow down, all of a sudden. Then a moment later, she was struck with terror. She froze for a minute and promptly fell to the floor, staining it with her blood. There he was, James. The poor little boy, standing there and looking at what he has done. He was filled with remorse. He fell on her and started crying profusely.\n\nHe then looked at me, his eyes filled with pure wrath. Before things could get worse, I took him by his neck and... I did it. Strangely enough, I felt nothing. No penitence, no guilt, no remorse. Plain nothingness, as if what I did was as just normal as drinking a cup of tea or brushing your teeth. It was so.. easy to do that. Even when I saw life slowly drain out of his eyes, I did not once feel sad about what I was doing.\n\nOut of the corner of my eyes, I could still see her breathing. Ah fuck, he couldn't even do the one thing he was supposed to, he absolutely deserved what he was getting, he was the reason all this happened. He deserved it all along.",

        "text": "What is chaos? Is it an idea? In English we define it as an idea: a lack of order, a state of confusion, unpredictability. \n\nSome think it’s something tangible. If we can account for every single factor using science, math, our own senses, and all that, we could explain all the chaos in the universe. We just aren’t at the right level of development to fathom it. Personally I disagree with this philosophy. It’s true, math and science can explain how a thing happened. They might even be able to explain why. But in the end, its still chaos. We humans will never have the capacity to understand it all, so to us it will always be chaos.\n\nJust as a random example, let’s talk about my sister. She’s paralyzed from the waist down. She wanted to be a dancer. She’d been accepted into a prestigious arts college. Then she went out jogging, stepped around a pile of snow at just the right time, that a motorist, who wasn’t even speeding, hit a small patch of black ice, causing his car to lurch at just the right angle, that the very back corner hit her, and she broke her back hitting the guardrail nearby. A tragic accident that could happen to anyone. \n\nYou know what’s funny? I dug even further. I was angry at the motorist. I’m not sure if I planned to do anything. Honestly I’m not sure what I wanted at the time. But I followed him. I heard him lamenting to friends. He said he didn’t even like going that way. He’d only gone that way after seeing a possum dart across the road, which caused the driver in front of him to screech to a halt, which aggravated him, and made him want to take the turn, and the snow from the night before had been shoveled into a pile at just the right spot that he didn’t think he needed to slow down. So who’s fault was it that my sister’s dreams were dashed? Was it hers for stepping around a snow pile while jogging? Was it the motorist for not going even slower? Was it the possum for running onto a road like a dumb animal?\n\nIt wasn’t anyone’s fault really. Legally, it was the motorist’s fault. You should ALWAYS drive carefully with pedestrians in mind. That’s what the law says in most places, and I don’t disagree. But I know more than half the people reading this just scoffed at the idea. Why should YOU slow down? You’re a careful driver. You’ll be able to react in time. It will all be fine. You’ve been on that route before!\n\nThat’s what chaos is to me. It’s that feeling that exists for eternity, that the unpredictable could still strike. Hell. You could go even deeper. Why DID the possum cross the road? Was it fleeing a predator? Searching for food? Did it see something it found interesting? Did a random gust of wind blow a piece of trash in an enticing way that caused the possum to investigate, which lead a coyote to spot it and give chase? What caused the wind? Why did the earth's movements seemingly conspire to cripple my sister?\n\nThe obvious answer is: they didn’t. There is no plan. Even if we could use science to deduce exactly what caused the possum to dart across the road, it wouldn’t matter. We’d just know. And it wouldn’t make my sister any less crippled. Even if we knew, what could we do? What could we change? Never build roads near possums? Never go out when there’s been snow? Always drive carefully? Never get upset on the road? Don’t swerve to avoid killing a possum? Creating roads that somehow shake or melt off any ice? Some of those suggestions sound reasonable. Some of them sound absurd. Even if we implemented all of them somehow, would it guarantee that nothing bad could happen? I don’t think it would.\n\nThat’s chaos. That one simple truth, that there is no one hundred percent predicting anything in this existence. Some turn to religion, or philosophy for comfort. I envy them. I wish I could believe there was a benevolent plan to it all. I wish I could just be comforted existing as we are, finding our place on this floating watery dirt ball in the infinity of the cosmos. But I can’t. I can’t, because I met Chaos. She was pretty cool honestly, if a bit… eccentric. She told me there isn’t a reason. We’re just here. Shit just happens. Our existence is actually pretty well ordered when you get right down to it. Human ingenuity has made it possible to bring quite a bit of order to our world. We’ve even found ways for those who get the shit end of the stick, like my sister, to live happy lives. \n\nMy sister is a motivational speaker now. She’s also competed at high levels of the special Olympics. It’s not what she wanted. But she says she’s happy. I think she’d be a lot happier if she could walk, but my point is, on some level, we should be glad we have as much order as we do. It could be so much worse. Chaos told me. I didn’t believe her. So one of her friends showed me.\n\nMy whole story took place a week ago. \n\nThat’s when I met her. I was pretty miserable. I have no direction in life. I don’t know what the hell I want. That makes me depressed sometimes, and I’d rather drink than go to therapy because I’m such a well adjusted human being. I also had a narcissistic tendency to use my sister’s tragedy to fuel my own nihilistic anger and apathy. Why should I bother finding a direction? Why would it even matter?\n\nSo after my soul crushing desk job let out, I dragged myself to my usual bar and slinked inside. That was when Chaos first struck. I had no idea who the bartender was. I was on a first name basis with all three bartenders at this bar. So this new guy kind of startled me. I’m straight as an arrow, but I have to admit, the man was handsome. Chiseled muscles, a square jaw, and skin so ridiculously smooth, he must bathe in moisturizer. He looked up at me with a smile that was pure pearly perfection.\n\n“Well, hello! You must be Angus!” The stranger said amicably.\n\n“Not to be rude, but who the heck are you and why do you know my name?” I asked, as I glanced around.\n\n“James told me he had a regular named Angus. Moody guy who shows up at around seven. Favorite swill is Guiness. You look like a moody Angus. Was I right?”\n\nI just kinda blinked, before letting out a sigh. “Yup. That’s me. Open a tab and keep the Guinness coming, please.” I was gonna make a move towards my favorite corner table, where I could sulk in peace, but the bar was completely empty. It felt weird to sit alone in that situation, for some reason. I didn’t want to invite this smooth skinned stranger to talk at me too much either, so the bar itself was out. In the end I took one of the tables near the bar, so the Bartender wouldn’t have to travel far to bring me my drinks. \n\nThe bartender didn’t move as I chose my seat. That annoyed me. “Can I get my beer, please?” I tried not to sound too contemptuous.\n\n“Of course. But you should know, James told me to cut you off after one. Sorry, Angus. No DUI shenanigans.”\n\n“The hell kind of bartender are you? You want my money or not?” I growled back in aggravation.\n\n“You know what’s less fun than a crippled sister? Being the one to cripple a sister. Even more so if it happens just because you wanted a drink.” He had an almost playful smirk on his face as he said it and it shut me right up. At least until I got pissed off.\n\n“Who the hell told you… what gives you the right… I… you’re no fun!” I sputtered in impotent rage.\n\n“Oh, I'm having lots of fun. Just not looking to kill anyone,” he replied, and finally, he poured me my beer. I just sat there seething, while he set it down on a coaster for me.\n\nI kind of stared at it for a while. Making excuses in some ways, and contemplating in others, while the delicious foam on my drink bubbled away. I reached out to pick it up and take a nice long cold sip, but I got cut off. \n\n“Guy’s a real buzzkill with all that logic, huh?” The voice was a woman’s. It came from literally right next to my ear. I felt warm breath and everything. I must of jolted myself a good three feet and let out the least masculine sound of fright I’d ever made (at least thus far that night). \n\nI tried desperately to collect myself as I stared at the woman who’d seemingly just materialized next to me. She was completely unassuming. Plain brown hair, plain jeans, a baggy gray sweater with some sort of goofy looking skull on it, and one of those faces that could work on anyone between the ages of twenty-four and forty-four. My lonely self noted how she wasn’t unattractive, by any means, but she wasn’t exactly eye catching either. She wasn’t looking at me. She was looking at the bartender, with a smile that was somewhere between cute, and predatory. “Hi Dennis!” She said girlishly.\n\nI glanced at the smooth-faced bartender. I couldn’t help but notice a bit of tension in his limbs as he eyed the woman. “Hi there Eri… or is it Set?” He said with a smile that housed some fear.\n\n“Yup! Set’s doing his own thing. Call me Azathoth.”\n\nThe bartender cocked an eyebrow and smirked in seeming amusement. “Hmm. A bit on-the-nose don’t you think?” He asked pensively.\n\n“What’s on my nose? When are we? Is Howard alive yet?” She replied.\n\n“Dead for almost ninety years now.”\n\n“Aw. Oh well. What do you think, Angus?”\n\nI didn’t respond. I was still recovering from this woman’s sudden appearance and her speaking into my ear. Then she turned her eyes towards me, and I froze up all over again. I don’t even know how to describe them. The color was some sort of yellow, but a sparkling yellow, like some sort of piss-stained galaxy. Her pupils barely focused on anything, and looked like two black holes in her head that sucked the rest of her eyes towards the middle. They had the manic, unfocused quality of a conspiracy theorist that snorted all the crystal meth.\n\n“Good point!” She replied to something I never said.\n\nThe bartender suddenly addressed me. “Well, Mr. Angus. I was going to have a chat, but it seems your night has been usurped. My only advice now is try to remember that you aren't dreaming.”\n\n“Bwuh?” I was the only reply I could offer.\n\nThe strange woman next to me, cocked her head, and frowned. “Are you leaving Dennis? I’ve only been here for a millenia! You’re like me!”\n\n“We are very alike, my dear Az-y. But you still scare the hell out of me,” the bartender replied.\n\n“Aw. You’re sweet. At least make a fun drink before you go!”\n\n“Anything for you” he replied with a genuine smile. I just sat there, utterly confused and bewildered by the madness that was ensuing. But that would be the most believable part of my evening. The Bartender named Dennis began one of the most elaborate drink mixes I’ve ever seen in my entire life. He literally juggled four different expensive looking bottles and flasks of pricey liquor, pouring out a little from each as they flew, he took a swig and spat fire just for effect, and he even balanced everything in the tip of his nose for a moment. It all ended with a bizarre concoction of almost luminous orange fluid with its surface on fire. He tossed the glass behind his back, only to whip himself in a circle and catch it all unspilled. Then he spun his way to the weird woman, and fell to one knee as he presented the drink to her. Also, all the while, the woman was clapping and cheering like an excitable child watching a puppet show.\n\nThe whole performance took about two minutes. He was so incredibly nimble and skilled that I actually forgot my confusion and watched in awe. The woman calling herself Azathoth cheered so energetically, that I clapped too. Azathoth took her drink while Dennis stood back up and took a bow. \n\nHe glanced at me. “I have to go now. Stay awake. And good luck!”\n\nMy brain was starting to catch up, by now, and my impression was this strange bartender was about to abandon me (and his business), to the whims of a strange woman who was likely on a lot of drugs. “What do you mean you're leaving?” I asked. He ignored me as he walked toward the door. “Don’t you have to run the bar?”\n\n“The bar is closed” he replied solemnly. Then he stepped outside, and vanished around a corner. Leaving me alone in a very uncomfortable silence. I turned to look at my strange companion, and was unnerved to find her staring right at me, sipping her insane cocktail through a straw (which I swear the bartender didn’t put there).\n\n“I like you.” She said flatly. I was already kind of terrified, but that just made me even more nervous. “You might flirt. I’m not date material, and my ass is shaped like a tesseract.”\n\nIf I could have gone blanker, I would have. “What the hell is wrong with you?” I wondered aloud.\n\n“Absolutely!” She replied with a smile. “So! You like thinking about chaos, huh?” She said between little sips. I swear, she never blinked. And no matter how she tilted her head, the black voids of those pupils stayed right on me, even when she turned her head. Well, not quite, I guess. They didn’t seem to focus on anything in particular. Usually you look at people's eyes or face. With her, her eyes just stayed in my direction. I was noting all of this as I tried to think of an answer. \n\n“I… how did you even… yes, I think about chaos,” I sputtered.\n\n“That’s neat.” She took another long sip, all without taking those insane eyes off of me. “Do you like it?”\n\n“Do I… like chaos?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“I…” until that point I’d been looking for an out. I made one last effort. “We probably shouldn’t be drinking in here if it’s closed.”\n\nShe reached across the table, grabbed my beer, tossed back her head and dumped the entire thing down her throat in the span of a few seconds. She casually swallowed, and licked the foam from her lips. Than she tossed the glass behind the bar. I heard it shatter. “There. Now you’re not doing anything wrong,” She stated. I swear her eyes got even wider. “So. Do you like it?”\n\nI’m the sort of person who loves to talk about his personal philosophy. Scared as I was by this highly unusual person who named herself after a lovecraftian nightmare, I was kind of eager to talk to someone. I’d been lonely. “Well. It’s not really something you can like, or not like. It’s kind of random. Sometimes it hurts people I care about, and I curse the universe. Sometimes I end up chatting with a stranger in a bar, and I’m really… happy.”\n\n“I am Chaos. I like what you think.” Her face was blank And she said it in such a deadpan manner that I actually chuckled.\n\n“You’re chaos? I expected more tentacles or something, given your name,” I said, trying to sound good humored. I really didn’t want to make this strange lady angry.\n\n“I never understood that part. I think Lovecraft was just scared of squids. Tentacles are actually very logical limbs in most species.”\n\n“I… huh.”\n\n“Your sister got hurt. Was it chaos’ fault?”\n\n“I… how…” I broke. I just rolled with it. “No. Chaos doesn’t really do anything to spite people.”\n\nShe loudly set her empty glass down, startling me with the loud clink, before leaning closer to me and widening her eyes into perfect unnerving circles. “Ohhhh yes I do. I arranged for all of it. Even the possum. The events that hurt your sister started twenty years ago with a deer tick in Ohio. I don’t like hurting people. But I don’t hate it either, I guess.”\n\nThat one stung me. I always get irrationally irritated when people talk about my sister. Now this weirdo was claiming they organized it as a god of chaos? “You’re fucking with me, right? You can’t be chaos incarnate.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“You… you look like a woman.”\n\n“You see a woman. Maybe it’s what I want you to see.” She actually leaned back and broke eye contact for the first time in a while. She looked thoughtful. “OH!” She snapped to attention and stared into my eyes again. “Or maybe this is just what YOU want to see! It’s not like your eyes could see the rest. And your brain? It couldn’t process that information even if your eyes could see it! Or maybe I’m just some lady with a bunch of cats at home!”\n\n“Or maybe it’s all of the above?” I offered after an awkward silence. \n\n“Exactly!” She squealed in excitement. “So I hurt your sister. I did it intentionally. But is it my fault?”\n\n“Can we not talk about my sister? If you hurt her, I would demand to know why. That’s all I’ll say.”\n\n“There isn’t a why. There never is. I just am. So is the rest of me.” Her eyes trailed off me for a moment. “I wonder what Set is up to?” Then she was back to her bug-eyed staring.\n\nI huffed angrily. “Look, I played along at first, but I think you’re just off your rocker,” she fucking beamed like a child getting a complement. My lack of alcohol, and a stranger shamelessly bringing up my sister had me a bit pissed off. “Chaos isn’t a person. Chaos wouldn’t show up at a shit bar to freak out random dudes.” \n\n“It’s not like I chose to.”\n\n“Then who the hell did? I think I’m done with this game.”\n\nShe cocked her head. “You’re mad. I thought you understood.”\n\n“You claimed you hurt my sister. You said you did it on purpose. I have every right to hate you for that. But you didn’t. You’re not chaos. If you were, I'd still wonder why the hell you couldn’t let this one thing go differently.”\n\n“I don’t make that choice. I’m holding back enough as it is! Don’t be mean!” She said, and she actually looked sort of hurt, but as far as I was concerned she was just some weirdo. \n\n“You’re a person, lady. I don’t know how the hell you know about my sister but that’s a sore subject. So screw you!” She cocked her head at me again. Silence enveloped us. Then those lips cracked and spread into an absolutely deranged looking grin. I broke eye contact, stood up, and stormed out. “Yeah, whatever, creep.” I mumbled. \n\nThe drive home started out uneventful. I wandered down the whole block, seething and cursing under my breath the whole way, wishing I’d gotten just one damn drink. When I reached my car, I dropped my keys, and almost lost them. Then, as I drove, I swear I hit every red light, and random slow-moving asshole that this town had.\n\nWith little miss ‘Chaos’ still on my mind, I screamed “FUCK YOU AZATHOTH” as I was cut off for the fifth time. I was fuming, and thinking about all the reasons I hated everything for hurting my poor sister. But part of me felt a little guilty. Whoever she was, she was quirky, but she sure seemed sad about me yelling at her. Ugh. I hate having empathy sometimes. I stopped at the umpteenth red light and gazed up at myself in the rear view mirror. I swear it was like I didn’t even recognize the tired, bitter, eyes staring back at me. ‘What are you looking at?’ I sneered. I reached up and flicked my mirror, right where my eyes were. I had to stop them because for a second I thought my reflection blinked without me. But that was silly. \n\nI sighed. “She was out of line” I reasoned. “Maybe I’m in a shit mood, and she didn’t deserve to be sworn at, but seriously. Who tells a person ‘I hurt your sister on purpose’? She was out of line.” Finally the light changed and I pulled onto the highway.\n\nI settled back into my fuming as I rode through the dark. It took me a while to realize something was off. I drove on autopilot, barely minding my surroundings. It took a good fifteen minutes for me to realize I should have reached my usual exit a while ago. I snapped into focus. \n\n“Where the hell am I?” It was the same nondescript stretch of road you could find anywhere in America. There were streetlights every hundred yards or so, and I even saw some fellow motorists, so I wasn’t too concerned. But I got more and more confused. I never saw any street signs, or exits, and it was absurdly dark, despite the lights. I looked to my phone for guidance. “Hey siri, where am I?” I asked my phone tentatively. \n\nI waited for a reply. All I got was “data not found.” That’s when I started to worry.\n\n“Hey Siri? Take me home.”\n\n“Data not found.”\n\n“Hey Siri? Where’s a McDonald’s?”\n\n“Data not found.”\n\nAt that point I pulled myself over to the side of the road to see if I could figure things out.\n\nMy phone may as well have been a brick. No service, data usuage wasn’t working for some fucking reason, and it could do nothing to give me an inkling of where I was. I tried calling friends, but of course, that didn’t work either. \n\n“What the actual fuck!?” I snarled. I tossed the phone angrily into the passenger seat, and took a few deep breaths. Then I stared out my window, hoping to identify something in my surroundings, but like I said, it was just a nondescript highway. Other motorists continued to cruise by, some trees sat on the other side, barely visible in the edge of the streetlight, giving them the look of spindly shadowy figures. They moved slightly with some unseen wind. Something was just wrong with all of it, and I’m ashamed to admit it took me as long as it did to realize what it was.\n\nThere weren’t any stars. Everything above me was just plain black. A cloudy night could explain that, but the moon was still clearly visible. Bright and full. I glanced up at it. I got more confused. It had no shadows, or features at all. It was just a plain white circle. I tried squinting to see if I noticed a sheet of clouds or something but then, the white circle vanished. It was quick, but I watched it happen. It was like two sheets of black sky slid toward one another from the top and bottom of the moon (relative to me, mind you) until they completely blocked it out, and the white circle vanished. It lasted less than a second, and then the sky slid apart again and the moon was back.\n\nMy brain almost broke trying to make sense of what I’d just witnessed, but then the insidious thought occurred to me. ‘Did the moon just blink at me?’\n\nAs if to confirm it, it did it again. I kind of broke. The sky was blinking at me. I tried to rationalize for maybe two minutes, before it happened a third time. Then I started to wonder, ‘oh shit. Did I say ‘screw you’ to chaos herself? It can’t be.’ \n\nI looked away from the moon, and back towards the road. I happened to notice another car cruising by, but then I realized there was nobody driving it, and it had no windows or doors. I looked toward the shadowy trees, and I almost wasn’t surprised to see movement within the spindly shadows, as though the trees had come to life and formed some sort of monstrous shadowy spider. Just to cap it off, a freaking frowny face made of red light, winked into existence. Like an emoji within the squirming shadows.\n\n“This has to be a hallucination,” I said to myself. “It’s a dream.” \n\nBut then I remembered the bartender. He’d said “remember, you aren’t dreaming.”\n\n‘Okay, if I’m not dreaming, then the sky is blinking, and a tree spider with an emoji face is making its way towards me…’ you might be wondering why I seem so calm. Truth be told, I wasn’t. I was scared, but until that very moment I wasn’t convinced I was in any true danger. But as I watched the red emoji’s frowny face twist itself into a smile… the dams broke. Panic set in. I screamed for all I was worth, slammed the petal to the floor and almost lost control of my car as I peeled out onto the road.\n\nI glanced at the mirror, and saw some unspeakable thing, a twisted mish mash of spidery limbs all joining together at a single point, and that single point was now an upside down smiley face gazing toward me as it shrank into the distance. My heart was beating through my chest, I focused on driving, breathing, and ignoring the blinking moon which had migrated across the sky towards the horizon I was driving towards. What little light there was on the road literally started to dance as the streetlights turned themselves to shine towards me as I passed, like they were made of rubber and not steel. Meanwhile the road lines on either side of me started slithering. \n\n“Nope!” I said to myself as my terror mounted. “Not acknowledging any of that.” Several of the cars I was sharing the road with revealed themselves to be, shall we say, unusual. One of them was running on legs, like a horses, rather than rolling along. Another vehicle I approached, that I thought resembled a semi, seemed to have millipede legs carrying it along, but at least the car that started riding my ass seemed normal enough. At least until I realized the headlights had become eyes, and the grill was a mouth with sharp wiry teeth.\n\nBy that point, I figured I’d suffered a massive psychotic break. Somehow my terror took a back seat to this realization, and I calmly pulled myself to the side of the road again, reasoning it wasn’t safe to drive. The other cartoonish monsters around me barely acknowledged me. They just kept driving along, going wherever the hell they were going. I sat there trying desperately to calm my beating heart. “It’s not real.” I said. I repeated it over and over again.\n\nI only picked up speed when I glanced back in the rear view mirror and saw a glowing red smiley face speeding towards me through the dark. \n\n“It’s not real. It’s not real. That bartender was nuts. It’s not real.” This writhing shadowy mass I could barely see squirmed it’s way straight to my car. Soon the red emoji face took up my entire rear window. But it just sat there, gazing in at me (… I guess?). “It’s not real. It’s not real.” I black limb with wildly branching digits and what looked like bark on its surface reached around and seemed to wave at me through my front window. “IT'S NOT REAL!” I shouted at the thing. In response, it dragged a pointing tip along the roof of my car. I sat there and listened to the sound of (expensive) scratching on my roof. “It’s not real.” I glanced up at the mirror. The red face was now a winking emoji. As calmly as I could, I reached up and pushed my rear view mirror until I couldn’t see the face anymore. Then I sat there blubbering in the dark red light. I tried to ignore it when it started flashing on and off, and the thing started making a whooping sound. “It’s not real,” I repeated yet again.\n\nSuddenly there was a gentle tap on my window. I heard a voice outside. “Sir? Is everything okay in there?” I struggled for a second. It could be the fiends outside trying to trick me after all. But in the end, the promise of a normal voice was too great. I looked up.\n\nThere was a completely normal looking man in a police uniform standing outside my door. “I’m gonna need you to roll down the window sir. Slowly.” I just kinda blinked for a few seconds. I glanced around. The moon was no longer full, and it had its trademark shapes and shadows barely visible from here on Earth. The stars were back in the sky, and nothing was moving that shouldn’t have been moving. Also all the cars had tires. \n\nI risked a glance behind me, out my back window. For a brief moment, I thought the lights there were the red eyes of the tree-spider-thing. But it was just the flashing lights of a police cruiser. The nightmare was seemingly over.\n\nLet’s just say I wasn’t able to convince the kind officer that I wasn’t on any kind of substance. He took me to lockup “for my well being” and they ran some tox screens which would all come back negative. I spent a few hours in a holding cell, contemplating everything and trying to figure out who I should call. They released me at roughly two thirty in the morning. Someone was there waiting for me. That someone almost gave me a panic attack. The police escorted me into the main room, and I seriously considered running back into prison when I saw Azathoth waving at me. “Hi Angus!” She said cheerfully. I’m fairly certain I never told her my name.\n\n“Uh.” I replied.\n\n“Your friend here says she’ll get you an Uber home. We’ll forward you the address where your car was towed. Drive safe, sir.” The officer said dismissively.\n\nWhat could I do? I followed Azy outside.\n\nShe was on a phone, who’s make and model I'm pretty sure doesn't exist, apparently summoning an Uber for me. “Just so you know?” She said as I approached. “I didn’t really have anything to do with that. When you say ‘screw you’ to one of the many anthropomorphic avatars of chaos, it gets the attention of other things.”\n\n“None of it was real. I had a psychotic break,” I insisted.\n\n“I mean… that’s not untrue,” she replied, still not looking up. “A friend of mine lives in mirrors. He was checking you out. You happened to touch the mirror he was using and got partially pulled through to a place where all reflective surfaces act as portals.”\n\n“I… reflective surfaces?”\n\n“Yup! You know, like the moon, or the paint on roads, or mirrors. You’re really lucky you touched the mirror again and got yourself out. Or, maybe, like you said, you’re just going a bit crazy, right?”\n\n“How do you explain that tree-spider-emoji thing?”\n\nShe stopped what she was doing, furrowed her brow, and stared blankly at me. “The what?”\n\n“That thing that came from the trees!“\n\nShe stared at me with skepticism I can only describe as infuriating. “‘Tree-spider-emoji thing?’ What the hell are you talking about?”\n\n“It chased me!”\n\n“I… I have no idea what that was. Maybe you are crazy.” Her eyes lit up. “Or maybe it’s something new!”\n\nI was beyond my limit. “What the fuck ever. Why are you here? How do you know my name?”\n\n“No idea. Maybe I felt bad. Maybe I'm a sadist. Maybe I'm flirting. I just wanted to let you know, I don’t do grudges, or vengeance. I don’t do anything on purpose. But I do everything. What did or didn’t happen to you tonight had nothing to do with being mean to me before.”\n\n“Mean? Lady, you claimed you hurt my sister on purpose!”\n\n“Intentionally. But not on purpose. I don’t have purpose, silly. I just am. Just like you.”\n\nI didn’t really have an answer to that.\n\n“You’re ride will be here soon. You’ll have to pay. I don’t do money. See you later!” She walked away and turned down an alley. I have no idea where she went after that. For all I know, she just vanished into the air. Something about her words resonated with me. ‘I just am, just like you.’\n\nIt made me feel weirdly good about things. What happened to my sister, all the sadness and hate in the world, everything wrong with my life, and the world around us, not much of it is anyone’s plan. Most of it just is, and maybe that’s okay. \n\nI contemplated all the way home, and almost forgot to tip the driver. The next day, I’d decided whatever happened to me was some sort of stress induced hallucination. Mirror portals would be insane. So I called an Uber again to take me to pick up my car. And now, I’m not so sure what is and isn’t crazy. When I finally reached my vehicle, I couldn’t help but notice the scratches in my roof that definitely weren’t there last night. I remembered the tree-spider. “Someone must have done this last night while it was here,” I told myself. Then my phone vibrated. I received a text from an unknown number. Just a series of emojis. \n\n“☹️🙂🙃😉 … 😡” \n\nChaos just is. You can’t really control everything. Even our laws of physics theoretically are slaves to chaos. You might step off a curb and fall into another dimension. But I really wish the randomness of the universe would fuck off for a while.",

        "author": "anony-mouse8604",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103zoet/dive_208_or_how_a_natgeo_marine_wildlife/",
        "text": "Holding my mask against my face with my right hand and my Nikon Z7 underwater camera with my left, I stepped off the edge of the small trawler, and with a splash I found myself in a new world: blue, endless, and empty.\n\nI'd been a professional marine wildlife photographer for almost a decade, but this trip checked a lot of \"first time\" boxes, and I was more nervous than I'd been in years. With only a handful of exceptions, every one of my 207 professional dives since signing with National Geographic had been from the deck of one of the many ships in the well-maintained fleet employed by their usual contractors. If you'd asked me a year ago whether I'd ever be 200 miles off the coast of Guam in a rusted fishing trawler from back when World War One was still known as The Great War, I would have asked for some of whatever you were smoking.\n\nI like to tell people I worked for National Geographic, but the reality is I was a freelancer, and when freelancers don't have worthwhile photos to sell for long enough, NatGeo takes you off the list. Once that happens it's time to start looking at other lines of work. After my award winning pics of the Golden Jellyfish in Palau's Jellyfish Lake in January 2020, I'd done nothing. Nothing NatGeo wanted, anyway. With the end of the 2021 fiscal year two months away and contractor cuts to follow, I was expecting to be on a bread line before MLK Day if I couldn't wrap my lens around something extraordinary very soon.\n\nFollowing my latest unsuccessful endeavor I found myself in this exact Guamanian saloon drowning my worries in Filipino Tubâs (six or seven at least, factoring heavily in what came next) when a retired fisherman, from Massachusetts of all places, bought me another. He'd put away quite a few himself by this point and was practically unintelligible when he mentioned his plans to head east the following dawn to follow a rumor of humpback whales migrating South toward Papua New Guinea. I have good sources for such professional opportunities and hadn't heard anything, but desperation trumps skepticism any day of the week. I bought the next round and asked to tag along. Excited to have company he happily obliged, and I didn't get a look at the state of his vessel until my tanks were full and my gear was piled dockside the next morning.\n\nSix hours later the engine sounded like it would rattle its last breath any minute, and I hadn't seen one sign of life save for my once-again drunken companion, when a titanic silver humpback erupted from the water off the starboard bow, hung silhouetted against the sun with all the glory of an angelic choir, then almost capsized our dilapidated craft when it splashed through the surface and disappeared. With an explosion of hope, I readied my camera, fins, tank, and BCD, checked my levels, zipped my suit, and followed.\n\nWhen the bubbles cleared...nothing. Emptiness, except for the angled shafts of sunlight piercing and atomizing in the blue vacuum around and beneath me. Looking endlessly down, I remembered my very first open water dive years before. Standing amazed on a vast plain of sand and coral thirty feet or so beneath the ceiling of the water's surface, it gave the strange impression of being indoors; an immense room without walls, fading into hundreds of feet of crystal clear Caribbean visibility. But now, in conditions somehow even clearer but without any frame of reference whatsoever, I struggled to process the infinite abyss below. Billowing prismatic pastels near the inverted horizon, shading down, down, down, from sunlit turquoise to cobalt to darkest navy midnight as light itself was lost to depth.\n\nSurfacing and pushing my mask up my forehead, I squinted and shaded my eyes and found my companion on the trawler's deck with a pair of binoculars in hand, shrugging. Resettling my mask and submerging again, I peered into the ocean distance in the direction the whale had been facing when it disappeared. I used my Nikon's zoom and rotated in place, surveying, searching for the whale, any whale, anything at all in the universal void. Humpbacks rarely travel alone; I'd expected a pod of a dozen or more, especially with the migration distance we're talking here, so something didn't feel right. Wildlife photography is a game of patience, but after ten minutes of absolutely nothing I started thinking about calling it quits.\n\nThat's when I heard it. The song of the humpback whale is one of the most energetic and complex in the world, and can often be heard from dozens of miles away, but when I turned again to find the source of this melancholy vocalization I saw an adult male cruising my way only a few hundred feet off. I kicked laterally and raised my camera trying to dramatically frame what I hoped would be my professional salvation when a deep bass reverberation - no whale noise; more a shockwave through my chest than something registering as sound - sent a ripple through the firmament around me. Through my camera's LCD viewfinder I watched a massive black tentacle reach out of the depths, wrap around the fifty-foot whale like an octopus snaring an anchovy, and withdraw in an instant into the invisible depths. So quickly was this enormous cetacean erased from its position that a whirlpool funnel formed to fill the space left behind before quickly dissipating.\n\nI don't know how long I floated there utterly dumbfounded, staring unfocused into the void, unable to process what I'd seen. A moment later - seconds? An hour? - a mechanical rumble pierced my cognitive haze and I looked up to see the rotating propeller of the rusted fishing boat speeding away, leaving me floating there in the ocean vastness. Alone. Or, not.\n\nBewildered as I was, panic didn't even occur to me. The engine drone faded and disappeared, and I was left in absolute silence. It may have been a kind of autopilot kicking in to fill the mental emptiness, but slowly I raised my camera and began panning around once again before looking down. From empty nebulous blue, circular definition began to materialize, hundreds, thousands of miles beneath me: a gargantuan lidless eye, wreathed in writhing black tentacles, faint around the edges, gradually coalescing as it languidly rose from the abyss.\n\nWide-eyed and empty, I clicked the shutter.\n\nI stared into that abyss and the abyss stared back, long enough for the emergency oxygen indicator on my wrist to start panicking. That's happened to me only once before, and it means I must have floated there for hours. I may not have noticed the vibration at all if that drunken asshole hadn't come to his senses, turned around, and hauled my dead weight out of the water.\n\nThe fact that I still had that single photograph at all to present to National Geographic is thanks to a two-dollar length of braided nylon that attached my camera to my wrist. But alas, despite the extraordinary nature of my subject, \"professional salvation\" turned out to be no more than wishful thinking. I was out of my mind to think NatGeo might actually print it, rather than put a rush on my contract cancellation amid allegations of fraud.\n\nI don't dream much anymore, maybe once a month or so, and every time I do I see it again. They say nobody dreams the past, you don't dream memories, and I think they're right. That's just something that happens in the movies. Every time I see that eye again, it feels like I'm somehow truly staring at it anew. Present tense. And I can't help but feel it's staring back.\n\nAnyway, can I top off that Tubâ? Or are you ready to close out?",

Any unauthorized viewing or sharing of this document is strictly prohibited, and will result in severe consequences.//\n\nThe following is the second file I managed to retrieve from the government archive. There were three things inside of the file. The first looks to be a transcript of a 911 call, but a few things are worth noting about it. First and foremost, the names were removed from the transcript before I even got it. There’s nothing for me to change for my own safety, as everything has already been changed by someone else.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the caller and dispatcher are referred to as ‘8’ and ‘6’, respectively. This is strange, not only because they are numbers, but also because they are out of order and seem to have very little relevance to the call itself.\n\n8: Hello? Hello, someone, please help!\n\n6: 911, what is the nature of your emergency?\n\n8: Oh thank God! I need the police. I need someone, now!\n\n6: Ma’am, do you know your location?\n\n8: \\[//EXPUNGED DATA//\\]\n\n6: Okay. Police are on their way. What is happening, ma’am?\n\n8: Someone is at my door. They’re trying to get in. \n\n6: Okay, listen to me. Make sure the door is locked, okay?\n\n8: Okay. (tapping)\n\n6: Please stop that, ma’am.\n\n8: That’s not me. It’s coming from the door.\n\n6: Listen, the police are on their way. Find a safe place to barricade yourself. Maybe a bedroom?\n\n8: (soft footsteps)\n\n6: Did you hear me?\n\n8: I’m in my bedroom now.\n\n6: Okay, great. Now, try to push heavy objects in front of the door. Maybe a dresser, chairs, a bed if you can.\n\n8: (scraping, grunting)\n\n6: Now, just stay calm, the police will be there very soon.\n\n8: (heavy breathing, tapping)\n\n6: Ma’am, are you still in your bedroom?\n\n8: (tapping)\n\n6: Ma’am, are you okay?\n\n8: (scraping, tapping)\n\n6: Hello? Please, answer me. I’m here to help you, okay?\n\n8: (tapping, getting louder, then silence)\n\n6: Hello? Are you okay? Police are on their way.\n\n8: (soft creaking and scraping of wood on wood)\n\n6: Ma’am, please do not open the door. Stay in your room. Ma’am? Hello?\n\n8: (screaming, crashing)\n\n6: Ma’am! What is happening? Are you okay?\n\n8: (silence)\n\n6: Hello?! Please, answer!\n\n(end, by caller)\n\nThe second file in 003 looks like it is unrelated to the first file. It looks like a print-out of a social media post and comment section. The post itself looks to be an image of a woman standing under a streetlight, posted by a user named der\\_Retter. At first glance, it looks just like an artistic piece of photography. But closer inspection of the photo reveals that the woman is covered in blood, and there is blood on the sidewalk all around her. Here is the comment section of that post:\n\nFredMan1002: What the hell man. This is fucked up\n\nDreadidiom: What are you talking about?\n\nFredMan1002: The blood\n\nDeadidiom: Oh holy shit I just noticed\n\njunipertree3: who the fuck is this person\n\nFredMan1002: I dunno, this is the only thing on their profile, no bio no anything\n\njunipertree3: maybe its just artistic?\n\nDeadidiom: There’s no way this is real, right?\n\njunipertree3: fuck no. people these days love nothing more than to fuck with other people.\n\nFredMan1002: Well, it worked. I’m scared\n\njesse: cowaRd\n\nDeadidiom: who the hell is that?\n\njunipertree3: dont know, profile is empty\n\njesse: all of yoU are cowards\n\nFredMan1002: Fuck off, jackass\n\njesse: you are all Next\n\njunipertree3: this isnt funny, bitch\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\njesse: you are next\n\nDeadidiom: dude what the fuck\n\nFredMan1002: This isn’t a fucking joke\n\njunipertree3: i don’t like this\n\nFredMan1002: Do we like report this shit or something?\n\nDeadidiom: done, i reported them for spamming. their profile should be deactivated soon\n\njunipertree3: thank god their fucking ass is gone\n\njesse: im never gone\n\njesse: i know your full names and addresses\n\njesse: want me to prove it?\n\nFredMan1002: What the hell? I thought they were deactivated\n\nDeadidiom: they must have gotten a new account\n\njunipertree3: stupid fucker\n\njesse: i am coming\n\nThere are no other comments on this post. None of the users who commented ever posted again. A little bit of digging revealed that each of them went missing the day after the last comment was posted by jesse. There were also no more posts or comments by the jesse profile or the der\\_Retter profile.\n\nSpeaking of the der\\_Retter profile, I did some translating and found out that der Retter is German, and it translates to ‘the savior’. This could mean one of several things, but what I believe it means is that this ‘Jesse’ does not believe that she is committing crimes by killing people. She must believe that she is doing the world a favor, being a ‘savior’. However, that’s assuming that der\\_Retter was created by Jesse in the first place.

        "text": " \n\nFor some this story might sound FAKE but i am sure what I saw.\n\nI'm a car mechanic from Toledo, Ohio i was visiting family in Lakewood Colorado when i drove trough a forest at around 2:15 AM. I left my home late so i knew i would need to drive trough the night but i didn't expect do need to drive a 2 hour detour because of road works. What the hell kinda road works need a 2 hour detour, i didn't think much of it anyways. I should have arrived at my parents house at around 9 AM but i didn't make it and this is why.\n\nIt was 1:56 AM when i drove past a sign that read: \"beware animals might cross road unexpected\" by that I knew i would be driving trough a forest or a field. About 10 minutes later I arrived at the entrance of the forest and once again there was the same sign that said: \"beware animals might cross road unexpected\" so i made sure to turn on my fog lights so i would see if an animal crossed the road.\n\nI drove half an hour trough the forest and it was still going i thought in myself: 'damn this is a big forest when is it going to end' then suddenly my headlights went out so i pulled over and got out of my car. since i'm a mechanic i thought i could fix it myself, I opened the hood of my car and saw that the cable was disconnected, it must have happened when i hit a bump the cable was probably loose. I connected the cable again but the lights didn't turn back on, oh yeah the engine isn't on so i turned the key but nothing happened it didn't even make a starting noise. Dammit i guess i'l call my parents and tell them i will be late and then call a cab.\n\nI had 0 cell service so there was no calling and i didn't know how long to walk until there was an end to this forest and i am not walking in the night, I guess i'l sleep in the car until morning and then walk to the nearest gas station. I was about to get into my car when I heard a howl close by, crap i don't have time for this. I ran towards my trunk where i had an AR 15 stored (don't ask me why I had an AR 15 in my trunk i had my reasons) it was dark so i couldn't see 5 feet in front of me so i duck taped my flashlight to the barrel of my gun so i could see where the wolves were, then i saw it we stared in each others eyes when it ran towards me and i fired 5 times every shot landed in its head and i fell down in front of my feet. i nudged it with my muzzle to see if it was still moving but it wasn't so i was ready to get back into my car when i heard a moose and that's weird because there aren't moose's in Missouri, I didn't know if it was aggressive or not and i wasn't risking it so i got into my car and kept my eyes wide open.\n\nThen i saw it but it wasn't a moose it was something else it was like a shadow a human silhouette, so i got out of my car and aimed my rifle and turned on my flashlight but I still couldn't see what it was i told it to come closer so I could see it better but it had no face no anything it was like a shadow then it ran towards me so i shot it 3 times but it kept running the bullets went trough the shadow and into the tree behind it so i started running into the forest, I'm a pretty fast runner so i thought I lost it.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of walking i found a deserted camping i was used to camping out in deserted buildings because of my time in the marines that's why i shot the wolf so accurate if you were wondering I sat their on a chair what felt for hours but it was probably just minutes that is when I heard that moose again there was noway i was falling for that again so i flipped a table took cover behind it and aimed my rifle at the door.\n\nWaiting about 10 minutes and i heard a stick break so I knew it was the mysterious entity it opened the door and I dumped my mag in it but it didn't even get hit, once again all the bullets went right trough him. It ran towards me and I closed my eyes i knew it was over. Let me tell you one thing, in the movies and stories before you die your life flashes before your eyes but it doesn't. I was surprised when i woke in my with my rifle next to me, maybe it was a dream i checked my mag but all the bullets were missing so i did shoot them all, it was only then when i realized that i wasn't in a forest but it was in the same spot I left it in even my hood was still open and the wolf was like before laying next to my car. Weird\n\nMy car did eventually start again and i called my parents saying i couldn't make it, I drove home and decided to tell my story.\n\nTHE END.\n\nThis is my first story so i would appreciate constructive criticism\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story and I hope you enjoyed it",

        "text": "I think the mood I’m in today can be described as strained optimism. My brother has somehow managed to get some locals from the town over interested in coming by for a job interview, so there's a chance we're gonna have some more hires soon. \n\nWe went to talk to the Bannik last night. Cas was super nervous, but when the spirit proved to be supportive, he was pleasantly surprised. This time, the little old humanoid was even outgoing enough to show himself. He’s quite the droll sight, what with his wide mouth and the long beard that he stumbles over every time he gets up.\n\nAfter introducing my little brother, we sat down together, the Bannik crossing his skinny legs on one of the benches. I cleared my throat, speaking up in what I hoped to be a steady and open tone. “I’ll be frank. We’re here because there’s something we need your help with. So before we ask for it; is there anything we can do for you?”\n\nThe old man grinned and shook his head. When he spoke, Cas and I had to concentrate to make out the words. *”You have been keeping me perfectly content in these four walls, my dear.”*\n\n“That’s good to hear. Now, I’ve been faced with a bit of a problem lately…\"\n\n*\"I know all about the issue already. A mutual friend of ours told me everything about it when he came to bathe last night.\"*\n\n\"You don't mean the—\"\n\n*\"The wood-demon, oh yes.\"*\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call the Leshy a friend. So, is there anything you can tell us?\"\n\n*\"Someone's been playing you false,\"* the spirit replied, idly combing his beard with his fingers. *\"That much you must know by now.\"*\n\n\"Yeah, we figured,\" Casimir remarked glumly. \"Can you tell us who?\"\n\n*\"Not exactly, I'm afraid. I only see bits and pieces of the future, not full visions, and not of the presence. But I do have something to share with you.\"*\n\nI leaned forward. \"Honestly, I'm glad for any advice whatsoever right now.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, we're desperate,\" Cas added, nodding eagerly.\n\n*\"Go to the old black mill. You'll find answers there.\"*\n\nI froze up like someone had poured a bucket of icy water over me. \n\n\"The black mill?\" Cas repeated, eyes darting from the spirit to me. \"Isn't that where Jacek used to live?\" \n\n\"I don't want to talk about Jacek!\" I hissed. \n\nThe Bannik let out a wheezing laugh that quickly turned into a coughing fit. *\"I'm aware that something happened at the mill, Fiona. You wouldn't believe how many visions I had of you at the time. I don't need to know the details to understand that you made a major fool of yourself. You acted like that sixth sense I presented you with was taking a vacation, along with all your other higher faculties.\"*\n\nI could feel the heat rising to my cheeks. \"I don't want to talk about Jacek,\" I reiterated with stern emphasis.\n\n*\"Well, you'll simply have to, if you want to secure these woods. And doesn't the Leshy have your word on that?\"* The old man cocked his head. *\"Remind me what he'll do if you don't follow through.\"*\n\nHere it comes. The promise I made to the wood-demon. No use in keeping it to myself anymore.\n\n\"I have until the end of the twelve nights between the years to fix this mess. If after that another unauthorized trespasser makes their way into the forest somehow, the Leshy…\" My voice trailed off as I lifted my head to meet the spirit's gaze. \"He'll have me. I guess he'll drag me to hell or wherever his leafy ass is from and I'd have to be his servant for all eternity. Or he'll eat me, like he did the other guy.\" I felt weirdly disconnected from these possible outcomes when I listed them to my brother. \n\n\"Why the fuck would you tell him he could do that?\" Casimir sounded incredulous.\n\n\"He saved my life! He'd have gobbled me up on the spot if I had denied him!\"\n\n*\"I know you're worried, wench. But let me assure you; the Leshy does not want you to fail. And he'd take no pleasure in punishing you,\"* the Bannik chimed in.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" I muttered.\n\n*\"Take my word for it. I can't tell you why, but he needs you to succeed.\"*\n\nWe said our goodbyes on that note, concluding that we would head for the black mill the next morning.\n\nThe black mill used to be a relatively safe place back when Jacek was living there. Now that it's abandoned, though, there's bound to be some unpleasant creatures squatting inside. I normally go into the woods unarmed—weapons are an unnecessary provocation—but today, I'd decided that both Cas and I would be taking handguns and cleansing salt. We were walking side by side in silence, any attempts on my end to strike up a conversation remaining unsuccessful. When I finally asked him why he was giving me the cold shoulder, he merely grumbled something about me digging my own grave by submitting myself to the wood-demon. \n\n\"What was I supposed to do?\" I demanded. \"Hey, I'll be fine. I'll fix this, the Leshy will be happy, and everything is going to be just perfect.\" I patted him on the shoulder a little too hard, and we continued on our way, sloshing through the snow. \n\nThe twin lakes looked so peaceful. They had frozen over completely sometime during the last few days, a thick layer of ice having congealed them to shining, stiff mirrors. I could have mentioned the gristmill already when I recounted Cas' encounter with the mavka, but I really didn't want to think about that place.\n\nThe old mill is a decrepit ruin by the side of the smaller twin lake. Technically, it has never truly worked, not by natural means—there was no stream around that flowed strongly or quickly enough to turn the water wheel. When Jacek had been living here, the mill had nevertheless been in constant use. When we laid eyes on it today, it rather made the impression of a structure built to rot; a place that had never seen life before and never would. Its black walls and roof were riddled with holes and blades were missing from the water wheel which was hovering a few feet above the frozen surface of the lake.\n\n\"Man, this place is giving me the creeps,\" Cas murmured. \"It's changed a lot, hasn't it. Did you ever hear from Jacek again after… you know, the *thing*?\"\n\n\"No. And I don't wanna talk about Jacek.\"\n\n\"You keep saying that,\" my brother grunted. \"So you fucked up, what's the big deal?\"\n\n\"I'm not you. I didn't make a habit of it,\" I shot back, and Cas threw me an irritated glance. Before he could respond however, a howl sliced through the winter air, disrupting the relative silence. We both stopped in our tracks. It had undoubtedly come from the old gristmill. \n\n\"Oh dear God,\" Casimir muttered, instinctively reaching for my hand. I allowed him to grasp it, drawing myself up and puffing my chest out, summoning my courage. Suddenly, it was as though we were kids again; two solitary figures, soft and vulnerable before the ominous structure looming above us. \n\nCasimir and I slowly proceeded towards the building. Despite its state, the black paint on the walls was clinging to them as strongly as ever. Rounding the corner, we found that most of the windows had been smashed in. Even more unsettling were the scratchmarks around the frames. They couldn’t have possibly been made by an animal. Judging from how high up they were, the creature must have stood at easily the same height as my brother. I had to let go of Casimir’s hand for a second to wipe off the sweat lacing my palm. We slowly made our way over to the front door, finding it barred.\n\n“Guess the window will do,” I mumbled.\n\n“Can’t we figure out what’s been howling in there before we go inside?” \n\n“And how do we do that?” I retorted, walking up the closest window and starting to pluck away the glass shards that were protruding from the frame like teeth. I was nearly done when another one of those hair-raising wails rang out from the inside. Casimir jumped, and I admittedly almost suffered a heart attack myself, but I hid my unease, every bit the big sister. I slowly maneuvered my body and dress through the relatively small opening before gesturing to Casimir that it was safe to follow. Not much was left of what had once been Jacek's furniture. The charred remains of an armchair and a table told a story of smoke and fire. Big, dark spots on the walls indicated the places where the flames had been licking at them.\n\n“What happened here?” Casimir whispered.\n\n“Jacek was angry when he went away. He probably went pyro on his things,” I explained. “The building itself can’t be destroyed entirely; that’s probably the only reason it’s still standing.”\n\n“Is that something he’d do?”\n\n“Absolutely. Come on, there’s gotta be more.”\n\nWe started poking around the rubble, moving about as quietly as possible, knowing very well that we were not alone. We kept nervously glancing over at the broken-down staircase in the corner that led up to the second floor. Half of it was caved in, presumably because of the fire, so we wouldn’t be able to access the upper story of the mill. Occasionally, we'd hear the floorboards creaking above us; the sound of someone or something pacing to and fro. Each little noise sent a surge of fear through our bodies, but we kept our mouths shut, masterfully managing to stifle gasps and startled screams. \n\nIt was Cas who found the trail camera. He picked it out of a dusty pile of burnt *\"something or other\"* in the corner. It was broken for sure, contorted and covered in scratches and alarmingly deep teeth marks. It had nearly been bitten in half. Something must have torn it off wherever it had been mounted; most likely the same creature that had taken up residence on the upper floor. \n\n\"Shit,\" I whispered, giving my brother an approving nod. \"That's gotta be it!\"\n\n\"You sure? It's, like, super banged up; I don't think we can get any footage from it.\"\n\n\"We don't have to!\" I said breathily. \"What, do you think *I* put up trail cams around the woods? Hell no. Whoever did this has got to be the snitch, and this is probably not even the only cam! We'll show this to the employees, look for other cams; we can really do something with this!\"\n\n\"Okay.\" An enthusiastic smile of pride began to spread on my brother's face. \"Okay, cool! What now?\"\n\nI frowned, pointing at the staircase. \"Let's bail.\"\n\nI didn't have to tell him twice. Casimir headed straight for the window, squeezing through and beckoning for me to join him on the other side. Of course, my retreat was, as per usual, a little slower than his. Struggling with my skirt, I tried to duck through the opening when my stupid fucking cape got caught inside. Groaning, I leaned back to discover that it had somehow gotten snagged up on a rusty old nail sticking out of the wall. I started tugging on it, but that didn't work with the glove on, so I had to pull it off first. \n\n\"Hurry!\" Cas hissed. \n\n\"Jacek's house kinda doesn't want me to leave, I think,\" I answered, forcefully tugging on the fabric. Finally, it tore, and I was sent tumbling out the window, cutting myself on either the nail or a glass shard in the process. I cursed under my breath, but the thump of my fall had not gone unnoticed. \n\nThe same howl we'd heard before pierced the air. Floorboards started creaking and cracking inside the mill, accompanied by the sound of fast, heavy footfalls dashing down the broken stairs. \n\n\"Oh shit! Okay, go, go, go! Don't look back!\" I yelled, pushing my brother forth as we began staggering through the snow, back into the direction we'd come from. Casimir tossed me the busted camera as he got out his handgun. \n\nAnother howl, then the sound of wood splintering. This fucking thing was following us. Cas was smart enough not to use his weapon right away. There was still a chance we could lose this beast—whatever it was—among the trees. \n\nThings were starting to look dire, though. Soon enough, we could hear it running up behind us, panting and growling. Both my brother and I were starting to grow slower, our breaths coming out shallow and ragged. Casimir was red-faced and wild-eyed, struggling to resist the urge to look over his shoulder. \"It's catching up!\" he cried out. \n\n\"Keep going! We can make it!\" We totally couldn't. Not at that rate.\n\nAnother blood-curdling howl, then, strangely enough, a bark. \n\nI recognized that sound. I came to a skittering halt, and so did the creature. Casimir had stopped a few feet ahead of me, screaming at me what the hell I was doing.\n\n\"Don't shoot!\" I warned him, raising my hands. \"It's okay! I think… I think this is kind of a misunderstanding.\"\n\nSlowly, I turned to face the entity, letting out a soft gasp upon laying eyes on it. It was a black, shaggy wolfdog the size of a man. One of its eyes was missing, as was part of its ear. It was only skin and bones, and it reeked like a whole-ass sewer. \n\n\"Hey, I know you,\" I said softly, taking a hesitant step towards it. \"Do you remember me?\" \n\nThe dog sat down in the snow, lowering its dripping snout and proceeding to press it to my neck, sniffing fiercely. I stood still as a statue, my eyes shut, trying to ignore my mounting panic. The beast could rip my throat out right then and there, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't. Finally, it drew away, huffing as it got to its feet—or rather *paws* and turned to trot off. \n\n\"Wait! Ain't you starving?\" I called after it. \"I have food at home, I could—\"\n\nThe dog ignored me, walking away with its head held high. I pressed my lips together, feeling the sting of rejection.\n\n\"I thought Jacek took his dog with him when he left,\" I remarked.\n\nCasimir just looked at me in pure bewilderment. \"That's what that was?\"\n\n\"It's waiting for its master.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" My brother gazed after the creature. \"Am I supposed to be relieved now?\"\n\n\"Ten years. It's been ten years and that dog's still waiting for him.\" I sighed. \"You think it'll let me feed it? Did it seem angry to you? 'Cause I think it's still angry at me.\"\n\nCas shrugged. \"I'd sure be mad. You're the reason its human up and left, aren't you? Wait, was Jacek human?\" \n\n\"I don't want to talk about Jacek. Let's just go home.\"\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zu2umb/my_childhood_town_isnt_on_any_map/)\n\nA whisper in the wind. That is what Sonder is to many people, and what it has slowly become to me. I find myself, like many others, becoming unaware of its existence at all.\n\nA small town on the edge of England, forgotten as fast as it was built. It isn't on any map, and you won't find it by exploring. A town older than most, smaller than most, and lonelier than most.\n\nI got out 10 years ago. Whilst I can't say the same about others who lived there, I know that it has come back for me. Perhaps it would explain why so few ever leave - Why ever leave something that will follow?\n\nThe Screamsingers have plagued my mind since the day I left. I'll never forget what they took from me, or the part of me I left behind in Sonder. But it feels like that part of me is back, and I don't know if I feel good about that or not. Because on New Year's Eve, the Screamsingers plagued more than my mind.\n\nThey found me.\n\nI work in a small office building. 3 floors, and I work on the top floor, with 2 others in my room. I've been working there for about 6 months. One of the best things is the flexible working arrangements they offer. You can do the usual Monday-Friday work week if you'd like. Or, you can work Sunday-Thursday. I went with the latter - Sundays are boring anyway, with a lot of places being closed. I much prefer my Friday/Saturday weekends.\n\nIt meant that I had to work New Year's Eve, which I wasn't thrilled about, but I could live with it. I did lay in bed the night before, contemplating phoning in sick to work, but I've not been at the company long and didn't want to lie to my boss. I fell asleep fast that night, but I had a terrible nightmare.\n\nIn this nightmare, I was in my bedroom, and heard a familiar sound outside. Washing over the streets was a melodic scream. An enchanting whistle to some, but to those with the same memories of it as me, a blood-curdling horror. I told myself I was dreaming. I've had this dream before. But not for a long time - Not since I first left Sonder.\n\nI got up and opened my bedroom window. The sound poured in, as if I had invited this presence into my home. I stood and listened until the sounds died down.\n\nIn the morning, I woke up colder than usual. I got out of bed to look outside, expecting it to have been snowing overnight. Instead, I found that my window was open. I felt a deeper chill wash over me as I realised it may not have been a dream.\n\nHowever, I don't doubt that it was a nightmare. Dreaming or not, hearing those things again, was a nightmare. A dreaming one or a living one, those sounds infect my mind all the same.\n\nThe next few hours went relatively normal, minus the eerie feeling I felt. I've been conditioned into thinking that hearing those noises means somebody is going to go missing soon. The last time I heard them, they took my brother. I knew something was going to happen again, but I pinned that thought to the back of my mind, in the deepest corner. I wanted to shrug it off so badly that it's what I ended up doing - Brushing it away and forgetting about it by the time I was walking to work. I had convinced myself that this all-too-real event was a dream.\n\nAs I walked into work, the door chimes as it always does. *ding ding*\n\nYou have to slam the door shut for it to catch again. It's a bit broken, and if you don't do this, it'll keep blowing open in the wind, playing that chime over and over.\n\nIt was only 2 of us in the office. Me and Davide - He works in the same room as me. The third guy doesn't do Sunday shifts, and everyone else in the building had booked the 31st off. I didn't have any holiday days left, so I had to come in.\n\nIt was a very laid-back day. Davide is a great guy and we always have a laugh, so having the building to ourselves was nice. We got chatting quite a bit, and didn't get a lot of work done. He loves hearing about Sonder. He grew up in a big city, and has always loved the idea of a more rural upbringing. I haven't told him the horrors within, only the good memories.\n\n4:46pm. 14 minutes until we would have left. 14 minutes until we would get to go home and celebrate the new year with our families. That's exactly when we heard the chime again.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nBut the door didn't shut. So, we assumed our boss had come in to check on us, since he's often forgetful. We quickly sat up straight and acted as though we had been working all day.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nWe couldn't hear anybody walking upstairs yet. I thought perhaps it wasn't our boss. But then, who else would it be? Perhaps another co-worker had left something in the office and had come to collect it? Or, maybe it was our boss, and he was here to lock up when we leave, and not to check on us.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe stupid door would not shut up. Even our boss wouldn't leave it this long. Once he realises it keeps playing the chime, he goes to shut it properly. At this point, I thought maybe a delivery driver dropped a package in and left. It would've explained the silence downstairs. But the silence broke quickly enough for this thought to be dismissed.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nFootsteps, creaking up the stairs. Except, they didn't have the right sound to them. They were heavy, yet slow. They also didn't have the right pattern to them. It was a footstep, then 2 quick footsteps, then none, then 3 quick footsteps, then a slow one. They felt less like feet, and more like an omnipresent \"bang\" getting closer.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nMe and Davide looked at each other. I wasn't scared, and he didn't look to be, either. We were just both confused and uneased. The constant chime; the irregular thuds; the silence that they both pierced through. None of them created a feeling of contentment.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe thuds were loud now, as the final few steps creaked. We were both peering out the door, looking at the stairs to our floor. Waiting. Hoping to see our boss' head, or a co-worker, or anybody we recognised.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nA figure slowly emerged up the stairs. A figure I knew all too well. As the grey, skinny, morphing figure slowly became visible, my mind raced back to that day in the woods. The day I saw a figure on the rock. Only this time, I had nowhere to run. I was sat there, motionless, at my desk.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe chimes still echoed up the building, as the creature slowed down. It stood out in the open room, looking at us. I don't know whether Davide could see it, or whether he saw nothing, much like my brother. But either way, there we were, both frozen.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe lights went out. After being sat in front of a monitor for so long, my eyes were not used to this. A deepest of darks had encased me, and shrouded the room. Silence filled the air, as the Screamsinger seemed to stop making noises entirely. But I knew it wasn't gone. It was still there as I tried my hardest to make as little noise as possible.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe darkness felt thick. Like a blanket. It was as if I could reach out and grab it. Of course, the truth was quite the opposite - Anything could have reached out and grabbed me. I realised at this moment that I could hear something else: My heartbeat. All I could think about was my brother. Jacob was taken from me 10 years ago, and this thing was responsible.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nA creak in the floorboards. Something was moving. Was it the creature? Was it Davide? It doesn't matter what it was. Because the next thing I heard was a scream. Not the tune-like call of a Screamsinger, but the pain-filled cry of a man. It had gotten Davide. It **wanted** me to hear - I know well from my time in Sonder that these things can silently take lives. It had chosen, purposely, with clear intent, to not force silence on this kill. It wanted to torture me, to remind me. It didn't want me dead - It wanted me terrified.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nI could hear nothing but dripping. A pitter-patter similar to the rain hitting your window. The lights returned, and the Screamsinger was gone, along with Davide. His chair was soaked with blood, as a puddle of it was growing on the floor below. I sat there just staring at this chair. I think I felt so scared that I was almost numb to the feeling of it at all. I just sat there. I wasn't thinking, I wasn't moving, I was just sitting.\n\nI noticed that the chair was contorting. The number of legs on it kept changing - 2, then 3, then 1, then 4. I don't know if I was seeing things. I would assume I was if it weren't for what I had witnessed just seconds before. But a morphing chair leaves more questions than it presents answers. By the time the police arrived, the chair was back to normal. If you consider a blood-soaked chair to be normal.\n\nI have no doubt they were called in from the scream. They took me to the station and questioned me, of course. I told them everything except for what I had seen. They'd call me crazy, so, I told them that the power was cut and I couldn't see what was happening, I just heard it all. I was being held for a few days, but was released last night. They confirmed that the power did go out briefly in the area, and suspected that it had been tampered with intentionally. I don't know if they've checked CCTV, and I'm not sure what it would've even captured. I just know that I'm no longer the top suspect, although I would assume they're still keeping a close eye on me.\n\nDavide was a good man, and the first life I know of to be claimed by the Screamsingers outside of Sonder. But I keep thinking, what if there have been more? What if he isn't the first? A thought even more worrying - Will he be the last?\n\nThe Screamsingers are now out and free. So many questions, and I suspect all the answers lay within Sonder.\n\nPerhaps it's time I go back.",

Most of them are found, alive or dead, but sometimes people just vanish into thin air. I wondered how many of them were taken by the Death Cap Mountain Road. I wondered where they had taken the children in cages in the butcher shop from, whether Mara sent his monks or monstrosities out of the connections to our world to grab innocents and return, having new bodies to feed these demonic abominations and new souls to draw into himself.\n\nNaomi and I awoke in the corner of the main chamber of the castle, having fallen asleep from pure exhaustion after seeing Max brutally murdered and dragged off by a tow truck. I looked out the window and saw near total darkness outside. Yet further down the road, I could make out the flickering of fires where the direction of the town full of cannibals lay. I squinted my eyes, looking closer at the horrific sight that lay ahead of me. The white bodies of the crab-walking women, their grins splitting their skin wide open from ear to ear and their milky eyes staring forever up in bestial incomprehension, formed a perfect symmetrical circle around the fire. In the middle of the circle, a massive thin beast covered with leathery, black skin roasted Max’s body over the fire. I saw Max’s clothes catch fire, his eyes starting to melt out of his skull as his skin roasted. Even from over here, I could smell the aroma of burning meat, almost like the smell of pork roasted over a fire. It made me gag. \n\nThe creature holding him had a jaw that unhinged down to its chest, like a snake about to swallow a creature much bigger than itself. Its leathery skin clung to every bone of his fifteen-foot tall body, silvery eyes shining out from an otherwise dark face. Instead of having teeth, it just had one gargantuan rotted tusk, forming a grooved triangular marking the size of a sword. I swear those silvery eyes looked straight up at the castle window where I looked down at it, as if it knew I was watching and wanted me to see what happened to those who fought back against the Road, those who fought back against Mara.\n\nAs Max’s body sizzled and his skin blackened over the raging bonfire, the beast holding him reached his long, slender fingers into his body and ripped off pieces of it, tossing them in the air. The crawling women acted like rabid coyotes, biting at each other and snapping the human flesh from the air before it ever got the chance to hit the ground. Within minutes, nothing remained of Max- even his burnt clothes had been totally consumed by the crawling abominations.\n\nI turned to Naomi, who had watched the entire sad scene next to me without saying a word. She had tears running down her house. As I breathed in deep, I felt a massive jolt of energy and began to see white light everywhere. Around Naomi I saw an aura like a rainbow, emanating colors and energy in a shell a few feet around her. I looked down at my hands and saw the same rainbow aura around myself- blues, reds, purples and greens shimmered in intense iridescent layers. Focusing on it, I formed the edges of my aura into a ball in my mind and shot it across the room into a table. I could see the burning white ball of consciousness as it flew at an insane speed across the castle chamber. As soon as it touched the table, there was an intense flash and the wood lit like it had been doused with gasoline and ignited.\n\nNaomi looked at me in puzzled silence.\n\n“Now you try,” I said, pointing to a nightstand at the entrance to the hall. She breathed in deep, closed her eyes and sent a jagged pulse of light across the room. The nightstand exploded, showering us both in tiny shards of wood and leaving little droplets of blood around some of the splinters embedded in our skin. But I was so excited, I didn’t mind.\n\n“Maybe we can kill those things down with this. Maybe we can even kill Mara,” I said. She still had red eyes from crying, but I saw a small smile form on her mouth.\n\n“I want to go home, Jason,” Naomi said to me. I enveloped her in a hug, and she began to cry again, putting her face against my shoulder as we stood there.\n\n“We will,” I said, wiping her tears from her cheek. “This is the last act. Now let’s do what we came here to do.” Walking across the chamber holding hands, we went downstairs and began to remove the makeshift barricade of tables and chairs we had placed against the heavy oak doors after we originally ran in here to escape from the abominations outside.\n\nAs we walked out into the dark, a sweet-smelling breeze carried the smells of pine, blowing the sweat off my forehead that had accumulated from my fear and anxiety. My heart raced, I could feel the pressure of it even in my throat, but I still walked forward with my head up, looking all around for threats.\n\nWe walked around the castle on the forest edge, eschewing the dirt road entirely for now. That tall creature and those crawling corpse-women were not far away down towards the town and we didn’t want to risk any light giving away our positions.\n\nAs we snuck forward, I began to hear voices ahead of me. One of them I recognized as the soft, unemotional voice of Mara, a slight Indian accent marring his otherwise perfect grasp of English.\n\n“You made me a promise,” Mara said softly. “The US government and I came to this agreement nearly half a century ago, during Project MKULTRA, and all your predecessors have upheld their part of their agreement. You supply me with children, and I let you take the occasional monster from the Sacred Forest and the Road I have opened up to you.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I understand,” a soft-spoken, pudgy man said nervously, wringing his hands. “The CIA knows how essential you were to advancing our understanding of cell regeneration and psychic research. Your creatures have given us nothing but knowledge and helped us win the war against our enemies. So I know you are due your wages, but the amount of children you now request from us is likely to draw attention. Only so many children can be kidnapped from the foster systems of the United States before someone starts to realize that they’re vanishing and never being seen again. We have given you hundreds of children, but this new request for a thousand a year is…” He shook his head. “I don’t know if it is within our capabilities. We may be able to supplement our normal quota by kidnapping the children of illegal aliens, but you don’t understand the political atmosphere right now. The ACLU or some nosy reporter will eventually start putting things together if it gets too big…”\n\n“The US government is involved in this thing,” Naomi whispered to me. “How messed up is that? I wonder if they’re the ones who brought those kids in the cages here, to be eaten by the cannibals back in that evil little town of theirs.”\n\n“I think that’s exactly what is going on,” I said, lowering my head. The whole thing made me feel sick to my stomach, and I feared I might vomit right here and draw the attention of the ancient being dressed like a black-clad monk. I wondered if my white light projections could harm Mara, though I had a feeling that my new powers were given to me by the Road- and if the Road truly was maintained entirely by his mind, then he must be far more powerful than I could ever comprehend, less likely to fight back against.\n\n“...I will lead you out,” I heard Mara saying to the CIA bureaucrat, as he motioned him down the Road away from us. I sneaked a peek from behind the castle wall and saw Mara leading the man up the road towards the nearest mountain. The sun had started to rise and showed the fields at the end of the town were totally covered in white mushrooms.\n\n“Do you know what those are?” I asked Naomi, pointing to the mushrooms. She squinted and smiled.\n\n“Yes, I have some memory of mycology books I’ve read. Those are definitely toxic Amanita mushrooms, usually called Death Caps. Some of those in the other patches are probably Dying Angels. They are the two most deadly mushrooms known to humanity, causing an excruciating and slow death from liver failure.”\n\n“There’s so many of them,” I said, awed. The fields stretched out for what seemed like dozens of miles, and were totally covered in Death Caps and Dying Angels as far as the eye could see. “I guess we know where the Road gets its name. These endless fields of poisonous mushrooms.”\n\n“Yes,” Mara said, stepping out from behind the nearest tree, smiling softly at us. He had come around the side of us while we were watching the Road and talking. “The Death Caps were the final part of the rite that helped me create the Road, long before there were cars to drive on them. Two thousand five hundred years have passed since I started out on this path, killed my father by skinning him alive, then burned my mother alive…” He stared far out in the distance, his black eyes looking flat and alien. I couldn’t see much more than a spark of humanity in this figure before me.\n\n“How they cried, how they screamed. I remember my mother’s eyes as she looked at me, dying in agony, betrayed and frightened. That level of psychic energy, well… it is indescribable. More powerful than any drug imaginable. It is like being electrocuted by pure pleasure and power,” Mara said, running his hand over his shaved head.\n\n“When I ate the Death Cap and went into the deepest caverns, I was more powerful than I had ever imagined possible. The mushrooms killed my human form slowly, but the pure consciousness that exited from the top of my head at the moment of death was Deathless, and so luminous. It shone out a light so bright that it punctured holes in reality, and these holes connect this Road I created over the centuries to your changing world to this moment.” I took Naomi’s hand.\n\n“Ready?” I whispered to her. She nodded grimly. We focused all of our energy from our auras into a spear that emanated from our clasped hands and shot at Mara at the speed of light. The light hit him directly in the heart. As he screamed, dozens of monks started to step out from behind all the surrounding trees of the forest. We were totally encircled by Mara and his monks.\n\nThe spear that had struck Mara slowly began to cover his skin, crackling and sending off blinding sparks in all directions. It began to sizzle and snap through the air, striking into all of the other monks in the area of their hearts. Their skin and robes all melted off in unison.\n\nAs their human forms melted away, they grew. Their human eyes melted out, being replaced by silver eyes that shone a metallic light. They were the eyes I had seen in my dreams, the eyes that I regularly woke screaming from. Mara’s eyes were the brightest, like two silver suns flashing in the trees.\n\nHe quickly grew to fifteen feet tall, a marble-white beast whose skin clung to his bare bones. I could see all his ribs as his mouth opened impossibly wide, his jaw unhinging like a snake and falling down to his chest. Like the other creature I had seen, Mara only had one hideous, rotted tusk on the top of his mouth. He had a long tongue that he bit down on over and over, dripping blood everywhere. I realized this ancient being was totally insane, and had been for millennia.\n\n“He is like the Ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail for all infinity,” Naomi whispered, horrified. “He just gnashes at himself, here on this road, and will forever.” Mara screamed at us, sending droplets of blood flying in our direction. I pulled my hand away from Naomi and focused on creating another ball of light. It flew out of my fingertips and smashed into Mara’s opened mouth, sending him flying back.\n\n“Let’s go!” I yelled at Naomi. Mara was lying on the forest floor, still gnashing his tongue with his tooth as he writhed in a seizure-like convulsion. The white light still snapped and sizzled throughout his body. We sprinted past, the other monsters following us as we ran.\n\nPast the nearest field of Death Cap mushrooms, I saw a massive gate. It looked like it had been constructed from the bone of some massive creature, and the bones formed an archway fifty feet high. Through the archway, I could see the beginning of the Road, the place where Naomi and I had first found the Death Cap Mountain Road at 3:33 AM what felt like an eternity ago. She shot out spears of white light at the pursuing creatures as we sprinted through the archway.\n\nSuddenly, we were just standing at the spot where the Road had originally been, but there was nothing there. We had no car, we were both disheveled, cut up, my ear was missing, but we were here nonetheless. There were only a few evergreens where the Road had stood. We looked around, realizing it was dawn and that a car was driving down the road, probably some local from the town of Unity on their way to their job.\n\nWe flagged down the car and they called 911. Both of us were taken to the hospital and our cuts and injuries were attended to. I had the place where my ear used to be stitched up. The police were extremely interested in what had happened to us, but remembering what I had heard from the CIA man on the Road, I just made up a story about a bear attack. Naomi followed my lead.\n\nNow I’m back home, writing this story up on my bed. I’ve been out of the hospital for a few days now, and physically I’m healing fine. I don’t know what to tell Max’s family, and that keeps me up at night. I want to give them closure, but who would believe me? They would think I was some sicko making fun of a good man’s mysterious disappearance. Though keeping me up at night sometimes helps, because I’m afraid to sleep. \n\nDuring my dreams, all I can see is silver eyes, and I still wake up screaming every night. I have a feeling I will one day see Mara again, and I don’t think next time I will be so lucky to survive.",

        "text": "**This story is in the POV of a (fictional) well-known athlete.**\n\nMy name is Tim Harley, and I just had the worst experience of my life. Ever since I could remember, I played baseball. I was well known for my natural skills, and I rose to fame when I was a teenager. My early-20’s was the prime of my fame. I’m currently in my mid-20’s. Whenever I get done with a game, I admire the fans in the audience cheering me on and I wave to them all, making the crowd go a little crazier. But the strangest thing happened to me a few days ago when I was in a big game. My team as usual ended up winning the game, not to sound cocky, but because of me, so I did my usual wave to the fans, until I locked eyes with a creepy *figure* that looked to be smiling **straight** at me. It looked intensely focused on me and this abomination even appeared to be leaning forward just to get a closer view of me! There were *many* smiling fans in the crowd, but this *thing* stuck out the most, strictly because of how malicious it’s smile looked. The longer I looked at it, the more anxious I felt. \n\n*Uhhhh…*\n\nIs all that I could think. It didn’t appear human so I couldn’t help but stare in curiosity, I heard muffled voices of people in the background that sounded confused to why I seemed so shocked by something in the audience.\n\n*Is he okay?* \n\n*He looks pale.* \n\n*Tim? Tim are you there?*\n\n*Earth to Tim..*\n\nBut I couldn’t bring myself back to awareness, I was so struck and confused by what I had been staring right at. I looked at the people around the figure to see if they noticed it too, but everyone’s eyes were too focused on me. I gestured to some of them.\n\n*Look beside you! Look beside you!*\n\nI said. Some of them did, but none of them reacted to what was sitting right next to them. The other players walked by looking at me in confusion and worry, and this staring contest  between me and this figure continued on for a few minutes until I freaked out and fell to the ground screaming. I covered my mouth, slightly humiliated and I saw a few people coming towards me to help me, but I just quickly got up and left. When I got home, the first thing I did was turn on the MLB TV station, and on the news was of course me. On live television. The cameras zoomed in on my pale face as I ***fell to the ground and passed out***. People ran up to me to help me and I was eventually carried into an ambulance.\n\n*What the..*\n\nI thought to myself. To remind you, this was all happening live, so why on earth did I remember getting up and going back home? \n\n*Was this all a dream?* \n\nI ran to the bathroom to collect myself and splash myself in the face with water, but, I looked into the mirror and I didn’t see a reflection. I screamed in terror. I ran outside to see if anyone else could see me, I walked up to a jogger and they didn’t respond to me standing right in front of them, in fact, they just ran straight through me.\n\n*What is going on?!*\n\nI said. The jogger looked as if he didn’t notice me at all. I went back into my house to watch the TV and hopefully get an update on what happened to me. The more minutes that passed, the more and more anxious I got. Until they finally gave an answer to the public..\n\n*We are sorry to announce, that our beloved Tim Harley has just passed away.*\n\nI felt chills run down my spine. \n\n*How is this even possible?*\n\nI said in a frightened voice. I had never been more conflicted, confused, and scared in my *entire* life. That’s when I suddenly remembered an urban legend that always freaked me out as a kid. It was called ‘Crowd Smiler’ and it would appear in big crowds. The first person to notice it would be cursed, and killed right on the spot. It was said that just looking at it’s distorted face would be enough to give someone a heart attack and kill them on the spot. The victims would all take the place of the last crowd smiler, and the only way their souls could be freed from earth is if their lucky enough to catch the eye of someone without drawing attention to themselves. That explains why the jogger didn’t notice me.",

Why not go in and see what it is like, so for days they thought on the idea but were too sketchy of it and after some weeks past they decided \n\"well a peak wont hurt.\"\nSo on a warm sunny day they both set out to seek and admire the forrest for its beauty, when they entered the forrest they suddenly noticed that the land is far more beautiful and bigger than it looks.\n\nThey began exploring and taking small brakes to take in the sightings of the areas and as the day went on, the light of the sun begin to vanish out the sky rather quickly and the two noticed and started to make there way out of the forrest before it got too dark.\nThough they explored so much of the forrest they forgot one minor/major detail and rule, \n(If you get lost leave a trail of bread crumbs.)\nthat way you'll find your way home.\n\nSo they began to move quicker and started scanning the area for familiar sights and things they recognized...\nwith no aveil, soon they started to notice the sun fading in the distance and all the sudden, . . the guy. . \nneeded to use the bathroom.\nAnd the girl sighed and waved him off to do his business, as the guy went to use the bathroom the girl began to look for any signs of recognition.\nShe thought she caught glimpse of something she seen along the way and she went forward to make the claim, she soon noticed it was just the same tree they passed three times already as she said \"i guess it was familiar but its not a good sign.\"\n\nWhile she examined the tree she heard her husband calling for her, he was saying \"hey come here i think i found something helpful\"\nwhen she replied \"well thank god.\"\nshe went into the direction where he was\nwhen she felt a tap on her shoulder.\nShe immediately jumped and turned to see who or what it was, when her husband shushed her and quietly said \n\"Something is out here, we need to find our way out now!..\"\n\nShe confusedly replied \n\"What do you mean, i thought you was calling my name just a minute ago?..\"\n\nHe shook his head no and said\n\"When i went to the bathroom i heard you call for help from a distance, only to hear a branch break behind me to see you going the opposite direction.\"\n\nShe said back \"Well i heard you telling me you found something helpful and thats why i went this way.\"\n\nHe shook his head and told her \n\"This isnt normal, we need to get out of this forrest as soon as we can.\"\n\nWith that being said they went in the opposite direction from which they heard the voices coming from, they hurried along when suddenly another voice was heard from behind them saying \n\"Hello there im park ranger Sgt.Drewdetski how may i help you.\"\nthey turned around and was fixing to reply when they noticed nobody was there.\n \nStumbled and confused they begin to run, and while they where running they could hear whispers and screams crying for help. \nThey could hear the voices calling for help while other voices where crys and screams begging them to stay, the couple began crying and screaming out \"Nooo! Leave us alone!! Please!..\"\nthey soon stumbled upon a small hill and quickly climbed it as fast as they could and realized on the top was a road, noticing this they looked and soon as they reached the road a car swerved out of the way to avoid hitting them.\n\nConfused the driver got out and said \n\"What the hell!?\"\nthe couple ignored the stranger and ran across the road back into the civilization they knew.\nAnd to this day they hardly mentioned it unless asked about it, now they take different routes and avoid the forrest as best as they can thinking maybe we should of asked instead. . .\n.\nAbout the Raven Mocker.",

        "text": "\nI was ten years old when I was put on a plane to fly across the country and live with a Father I'd never met before. The few things I knew about him, which my social worker had told me, was that he was a veteran and he lived on the other side of the country. Social services had a hard time finding somewhere to place me after her death. My mother, who’d just passed away in a car accident on the way to work, had no immediate family. It was then determined that my Dad would take me. To this day I still can’t figure out why he’d even agreed to do this.\n\nI had many different ideas and fears about what he would be like but in reality he was simply, well, disappointing. Ever since I’d arrived at his doorstep, he’d treated me as if I was some unwanted pet. He tolerated my existence and kept me fed, but it was clear that would be the extent of our relationship.\nI still clearly remember the day he picked me up from the airport. He was waiting for me and my airplane escort at the end of the terminal and already seemed tired. I was a scared little kid, but he just gave an annoyed sigh as he led me to the car.\n\n\"Look\", he said bluntly as we were driving to my new home. \"I don't really like kids. I'll do my own thing, and you do yours. Deal?\"\n\nNot knowing how else to respond, I nodded nervously in the back seat. \n\n\"Good.\" He said, glancing at me in the rear-view mirror.\n\nIf I was disappointed in my father, I was twice as disappointed in the house. While the outside looked small and unassuming enough, the inside looked like it'd never seen a broom since the day it was built. Dirt matted the carpets and ugly stains dotted the frayed wallpaper. The house constantly smelled like rotting wood and unwashed dog even though we didn’t own a dog. My \"room\" turned out to be a single mattress in the attic.\n\nTrue to his word, my Dad ignored me and did his own thing most of the time. His routine was surprisingly simple. He’d spend most of the time watching TV and sipping beer, before going out to a bar in the evening and coming home late into the night. He was never physically abusive and he didn’t mind if I hung out in the living room with him as long as I was quiet, but the way he sighed whenever I asked for something or was too loud hurt. \n\nNaturally this wasn't exactly a prime environment for a grieving ten year old. I spent a lot of time up in my “room” crying, but it was too hot and muggy up there to even do that properly. So much of my time was spent outside. \n\nAs much as I hated living there, I will say the backyard was fantastic. The yard was huge, with a thick forest that choked the edges of the large mowed lawn. I spent a lot of time exploring. The bayous and swampy forests were magical. I’d like to pretend I was an explorer discovering a new land, each ancient tree becoming a mystery, each animal calling or tadpole a new discovery. And everytime I went deeper and deeper in, it was like I could leave my grief behind, if not for a moment. One day on one of my little outings, I happened upon a large clearing with an ancient willow tree, its arms stretching all the way to the ground as if they were too heavy to bare. \n\nBut what I spotted on one of its branches made my heart stop. It was my mother, dressed in one of her favorite sun dresses, humming a tune to herself and gently swinging her legs back and forth. I could only see the back of her but her profile was unmistakable. \n\nShock and fear electrified my brain. Something primal inside me was screaming at me to run away. I knew this was impossible, that it was a breach of nature. It had to be an illusion, there was no other way. But I didn't care. I burst into tears and ran to her, flinging myself on her and wrapping my arms around her waist. \n\nI completely broke, telling her how much I missed her and how much I wanted to go home. I promised I’d be a better daughter if only she’d come back. I told her I needed her and it was ok if we didn’t have that much money, just please come back. She petted my hair gently as I bared my soul to her. Despite the situation, I cried so much and fell asleep. When I woke up she was gone.\n\nThe past month I had been escaping to the swamps, heart heavy, with no ambitions except to get away from the day. But ever since I saw her in the woods, there was a change in me. I suddenly had a mission. I didn’t find her the second day, but the day after I found her in the same wooded clearing. She was turned away from me and the sun illuminated her yellow sundress. My heart jumped to my throat when I saw her. She turned to look at me, looking the least bit surprised.\n\n“Hello.” I said quietly. \n\n“Hi.” She said in my mother’s voice. But there was something off about it, it sounded colder than how I remembered she spoke.\n\n“Can I… sit with you?”\n\nShe nodded. \n\nI walked over awkwardly and sat. Now that I was here, I didn’t know what to actually say. As you can imagine, the whole scenario felt incredibly odd. However, the longer the sat with her the more I realized something.\n\n“You’re not really my Mom, are you?”\n\n“No.” She replied in a calm, mellow tone.\n\n“Then, who are you?”\n\nSilence lapsed between us. She stared off into the distance with an unreadable expression. I tried a different question.\n\n“Then, do you have a name?”\n\nShe was quiet for so long that I didn’t think she would respond when she answered.\n\n“Sarah. You can call me Miss Sarah.”\n\n“Um. Alright then, Miss Sarah.”\n\nI began asking her more questions but she either didn’t reply or her replies were short and slow. Instead, I started to talk about myself, if not to ease the awkwardness of it all. We talked for a good while (or rather, I did the talking) before the light grew dim and the forest started turning to twilight. I eventually decided to go home, but before I left I asked if I could visit her again and she agreed. I knew visiting a mystery woman in the swamp who looked like my dead Mother was well, a dumb and dangerous idea, but I couldn’t help myself. This wasn’t the type of thing I could just ignore and it wasn’t like I could tell my Dad about it, so despite my unease I kept visiting. \n   \nMy fake Mom, or Miss Sarah, wasn't the only interesting thing that happened that week. I went downstairs one morning to find my Dad and a stranger talking in the living room, packing bags for what looked like a hunting trip. I was surprised because I'd never heard my Dad talk so much, or sound so happy for that matter. The stranger turned to look at me when he heard my footsteps and looked at me in curious surprise.\n \n“Who’s this?”\n\n“Oh that’s just Lacey. Darline’s daughter, you remember Darline right? Uh, my kid.”\n   \n“I have a niece?” Said the man excitedly. “Why, you should have told me!”\n   \nHe walked over to me and shook my hand, and I was introduced to “Dale”, my sudden surprise Uncle. At first I had a positive opinion of my Uncle, as weird as it is to say it now. I was a kid who had suddenly lost her only parental figure, and Dale stepped in with all the sympathy and attention I was looking for. However, I became weary of him long before he had actually done anything.\n\n For one, if there was one word to describe my Uncle, it would be slimy. His hair was lank and greasy, and he’d often wipe his sweaty hands on his filthy pants, which did nothing but smear the grime around even more. I’d never seen him change out of his camo gear, and considering his stale smell of weed and alcohol, I was sure he never washed his outfit. Still, I wouldn’t have minded if he didn’t feel a little… off. \n\n As a single mother raising a young daughter, my mom had made it her mission to drill in my head the concept of “tricky people”. And Dale hit all my warning sensors for a tricky person. His hugs were always a little too long, he’d casually touch my shoulders from behind when I was sitting down asking if I was feeling “tense”, and he wanted me to sit on his lap when we were in the living room watching tv. For an Uncle who’d hadn’t shown up once during my time there except for the hunting trip, he had suddenly started showing up everyday. Still, it seemed to make my Dad happy he was around and I was afraid to make a big stink over nothing, so I kept my unease to myself and spent more time outside.\n\nOn the flipside, I was making great progress with Miss Sarah. I was uncomfortable and nervous at first, but I realized rather quickly that she meant me no harm, and I began visiting her every day. She didn't say it but I could tell she liked the company. However, there was one obvious glaring question that I couldn’t get out of my head.\n\n“Why do you look like my mom?”\n   \n“To hunt.”\n   \n“To hunt?”\n   \n“Yes.”\n   \nI didn’t get it.\n   \n“Are you hunting me?”\n     \nShe gave the faintest of smiles.\n   \n“No.” She said, “You aren’t something to hunt.”\n   \n“Then, can you…please stop looking like her?”\n   \nShe seemed surprised  “You do not like it?”\n   \n“No. Because… because, well- you *aren’t* her!” I said with a big sob. “I know my Mom died, I-I’m not stupid. But every time I see you it makes me think of her. Like I can almost pretend it’s really her. But you’re not her Miss Sarah. You’re n-not. I’d rather you just look like you.”\n   \nShe sat there quietly as I sniffled.\n   \n“I see.” She said simply.\n    \nAnd then the strangest thing happened. My brain felt hazy and I stared into space, and then a moment later I snapped back to normal. I looked over at Miss Sarah only to see that instead of my mother in a yellow sundress, it was a woman of indeterminate age in an old tattered dress. Her skin and hair were dark and while she now looked quite different from my mother, she still had the same quiet, unreadable look in her eyes.\n   \n“Is this what you really look like? You’re pretty.” I said.\n   \nShe smiled and patted me on the head.\n   \nMeanwhile things were getting increasingly more suffocating at home. Dale practically used Dad’s home as his own now, and he liked to come over when Dad was off to the store to “babysit”, which made me increasingly uncomfortable. Still, I think I could have put up with it if it wasn’t for what he did next. \n  \nEven years later I still remember crystal clear when it happened. Dad was out doing who knows what, and like normal, I was by myself. On that particular day I lay slouched on the couch, watching tv with the rotating fan pointed towards me, and all doors open, trying to escape the muggy summer heat. I heard the sound of tires spitting up gravel, and saw a familiar red pickup truck pull into the driveway through the window.\n   \nA moment later Dale walked in, two large plastic bags in his hands. I sat up and he gave that familiar rat-like smile. \n   \n“Hey sweetheart.” He said. “Hot as shit eh?”\n   \n“I guess.”\n   \n“Well turn that off and look what I got yah.”\n   \nCurious, I did what he said and walked over to him. He was kneeling on the floor and focused on digging out something inside the plastic bag. After a moment, he pulled out a tiny wad of fabric and handed it to me. I unfurled it and realized it was a bright pink doll shirt with the words Baby stenciled on it in glittery silver. I looked at him confused, but he just grinned at me excitedly, expectantly. \n   \n“Well? Try it on!”\n   \n“This?!” I said in disbelief. It was at least two sizes too small, and the end of the shirt wouldn’t even cover my belly button.\n   \n“It’s too small!”\n   \n“It's supposed to be like that. Come on, it's what all the girls wear these days. But if you don’t like that, I have other things you can try on, look!” \n   \nHe started rummaging through the bags and pulling out items one by one. My stomach dropped as he lay them out on the floor.\n   \nThere was a skimpy sailor outfit with a skirt way too tight with a matching heart shaped gartner, shorts that bordered on looking like underwear, a couple risque looking dresses, some crop tops, and of course various types of underwear that he made sure to express were specially handpicked by him.\n   \n“So, what do you want to try on first?”\n \n “None of it.” I said staunchly, nervousness flaring in my gut.\n   \n“Oh come on, don’t be like that. I spent a lot of time- stop backing up! -picking these out. Just try on something.”\n   \nI kept denying, but Dale kept insisting. I tried to hold out, but Dale was getting more and more forceful with his urging. There was an undertone of aggressiveness to it that scared me, and my nerves were threatening to swallow me.\n   \n“Ok.” I said meekly, just wanting to get this nightmare over with.\n   \n“Excellent!”\n   \nI looked over the collection and picked out what I deemed to be the most appropriate looking item; a red wine spaghetti strapped sequin dress. I turned towards the direction of the bathroom when Dale grabbed my arm.\n   \n“Where are you going?”\n   \n“To the bathroom.”\n   \n“No, you’re going to put it on here.”\n   \n“What?!”\n   \n“I want to see you put it on. So I can make sure you are putting it on properly.”\n   \nWe broke out into an argument again, but this time Dale was out of patience. His tone flared right up into that angry undertone again, and he started shouting and waving his arms in an agitated manner.\n   \n“Put. On. The. Dress. Put on the dress! The underwear too! I want to see you put it on!”\n   \nI shook in place, sobbing and gripping the dress as he increasingly grew angrier and angrier.\n      \n“What’s going on here?”\n   \nDale’s head whipped around to see a concerned and confused looking Dad standing in the doorframe. Neither of us had heard his car pull up, but a sudden sense of relief flushed through me. Dale’s eyes went wide.\n    \n“I bought Lacey new clothes for school and she hates them.”\n   \n“What? Is that true?” Dad said, looking at me.\n   \n“N-no!” I manage to choke out.\n   \n“I thought she probably didn’t have a lot of clothes now since she moved, so I wanted to be nice and buy her some. But she hates them. They’re not stylish enough for her.”\n   \n“Lacey!” Dad barked, frowning. \n   \nI wanted to defend myself, but it was like there was a large golf ball in my throat, and the words simply wouldn’t rise.\n   \n“Your Uncle goes out of his way to be nice to you, and this is how you act?” He began stomping over.  “You’re such an ungrateful…” his tone trailed off once he got close enough to actually see the clothing laid out on the floor. \n\nHis eyes widened and he stared at them. Dale tried to hastily stuff them in the bag and quickly said, “I don’t know what kids like these days so I only got what the female clerk recommended to me. I just got what she said to get, but I don’t really know what kids like these days, you know?” He gave a nervous laugh.\n   \nDad was quiet for a moment, but then said, “Lacey got to your room.” However his tone had lost almost all its previous anger.\n\nHe didn’t need to tell me twice, and I gratefully escaped. I don’t know what Dad and Dale talked about, but I didn’t see Dale for the next week. Dad seemed pretty depressed about it, but didn’t talk about it so I never asked.\n   \nI gratefully regaled this to Miss Sarah. That had become our routine. I would talk and talk about whatever was on my mind and Miss Sarah would listen. Sometimes she’d ask questions and I’d answer, but she mostly just listened. I got the feeling that she didn’t know much about the modern world, since most of her questions consisted of asking what things were, such as television or electronic fans when they came up in conversation. Computers were especially hard for me to explain to her, and by the end of my jumbled explanation I wasn’t sure if she actually understood what I was saying or was just pretending to.\n   \nI stopped asking too many questions about herself however. She didn’t explicitly say it, but I got the feeling she didn’t like talking about herself, and any replies for when I did ask were usually short.\n   \nA week and a half was all it took for my Father to let Dale back over to the house. My Father had pulled me aside and said, “Look. I know what your Uncle did made you uncomfortable, but I think it was really all a big misunderstanding. He explained it to me and he really didn’t mean any harm, he just didn’t realize it would make you uncomfortable since he’s never had a niece before. He wants to apologize, so he’s coming over tomorrow.”\nMy heart sank. I immediately tried to protest but my Father stopped me.\n   \n“If you don’t like it then you can just avoid him alright?”\n   \nAnd that’s exactly what I did. Apparently Dale came over the next day but I didn’t see him since I was outside until dark with Miss Sarah. I came home to find a stuffed cat plush with a bow on it on the table, a handwritten letter that said “to Lace” beside it. I threw both in the trash. Dale continued to come over after that, and I continued to avoid him. The few times I did happen to run into him, he kept apologizing and trying to “make up” with me. I was polite to him so my Father wouldn’t get upset, but I always managed to slip away back to the forest.\n   \nOn the flipside, I was growing closer and closer to Miss Sarah although one thing bugged me. She practically knew my entire life, but I barely knew a single thing about her. She was still one great big puzzle. So one day I grew brave.\n      \n“How’d you end up out here Miss Sarah?”\n   \nI expected her to get mad or grow cold, but she never did. I wasn’t sure why I was expecting that, since Miss Sarah had never gotten angry at me before. Instead of her usual terse replies, she began to talk more than I’d ever heard her talk before. She told me about her life, way before. She told me how she used to live on a plantation way on the other end of the swamp. It was a long time ago, and she admittedly doesn’t remember much. She just remembers it was a miserable place. However, she did remember how she died. The plantation owner’s son dragged her into the swamp and raped her, then beat her into a broken mess.\n   \n“I laid there for a long time then.” She recalled. “Until the bugs began to eat away at my skin and my body began to sink into the earth. But my mind had not quite left, just slept. I lay dormant until bits of me began to slowly reassemble.” \n   \nMiss Sarah likened it to a broken mirror that had been glued back together. That is what happened to her. She was like before, but now fundamentally different. I didn’t completely understand it but I accepted it anyway. \n      \nThe next morning I was in the kitchen fixing myself some leftover corn dogs and thinking about Sarah. She had made my life so much less dreary these past couple of weeks and her story saddened me. I thought about what it meant to be family. She wasn’t blood but, could we really become a family? \n   \nA sudden jab pinched both my sides and I shrieked, dropping the box of frozen corn dogs. I whipped around and there stood Dale, looking down at me and smiling.\n   \n“Tickle fight!”\n   \n“GET AWAY FROM ME!”\n   \n“Come on, don’t be like that.”\n   \nI jumped back like a feral animal and nearly snarled at him, heart beating like crazy.\n   \nHe frowned.\n   \n“I’m just having fun with you! I’m just being an Uncle, ok? Come on, tickle!” \n   \n“Leave me alone!” \n   \nHe ignored me and came forward, arms outstretched and laughing playfully. It was anything but playful to me, and I screamed and shouted at him to stop as he started chasing me around the living room. He just laughed at my cries and continued swooping at me until I shouted,\n   \n“I’m telling Dad! I’m telling him what you're doing!”\n   \nHe dropped his hands and looked annoyed.\n   \n“I’m just playing! Come on, there’s nothing wrong with it.” He took another step.\n  \n“I’m telling! I’m telling!”\n   \n“God- Stop being such a brat. I’m just-”\n   \n“Get away!” \n   \n“Come here!”\n   \nHe swooped at me faster this time and grabbed my wrist before I could dodge him. He looked surprised. \n   \n“Let go!” I wailed, twisting helplessly. He watched me struggle for a few seconds, realizing I couldn’t pull away from his grasp. Then he grinned. I bit his hand.\n   \nHe immediately yelped and retracted his hand, the sudden movement sending me sprawling to the floor. My bite was deep enough to make his hand start gushing with blood. His face turned to rage. \n   \n“You bitch! You fucking bitch!” He tried to come after me but I was already halfway out the door, adrenaline pushing my legs as fast as they could.\n   \n“Come back you you fucking whore!\"\n\nI sprinted blindly through the forest, tears blurring my vision. I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t care, I just needed to get as far away as possible. My emotions kept bubbling up to the surface and I tried to drown them with my running. I ran for an indeterminate amount of time until I saw Sarah in the distance. I threw myself onto her and burst into tears, everything that had just happened exploding out of me. I’m sure she must have been surprised, but she just took me and sat down with me, stroking my hair as I wept and rambled disjointedly. She let me hug her like that for a while, pouring my soul out to her.\n   \n“Oh Sarah what am I going to do? He’s going to do something to me soon, I know it. It’ll be worse. I-I don’t want to go back. I’m scared, I’m scared… oh Sarah…”\n   \nShe cupped my sniffling face in her hands and brought it up to hers, looking at me lovingly. \n   \n“It’s time to go hunting.”\n\n    ...\n\n   I didn’t go back home until the dead of night. By that time Dale was gone, thankfully. I didn’t sleep well that night, and many thoughts swirled fitfully in my mind. The next morning, I came downstairs to see my Father and Dale watching T.V together in the living room. Dale’s eyes followed me as I went to the kitchen to make myself some cereal. \n   \n“Mornin.” He called out naturally to me.\n   \n“Morning.” I said.\n   \nConsidering Dad didn’t scream at me first thing in the morning, and the fact that Dale was wearing a long sleeved shirt even though it was the summer, it seemed that he hadn’t mentioned our little fight to Dad. I guess it would be more trouble than it was worth to try and twist what happened and make it seem like it was my fault again. He probably was afraid Dad might hear my side of the story this time. Either way it worked in my favor.\n   \nI took my bowl and plopped down on the recliner. Dale looked surprised. Usually I ate in the kitchen and left as soon as possible, wanting to spend as little time as I possibly could near  him. I paid Dale no mind and pretended to be interested in the T.V. I took a bite of my cereal. I could barely taste it.\n   \nAfter I finished my cereal I slunk off the couch, put my bowl in the sink, and casually walked outside, taking a few steps before leaning against the side of the house. It was a good spot. It was far enough away that I could have a private conversation without Dad hearing from inside, but close enough he could still hear me if I shouted.\n   \nA minute later, I heard Dale get up, mumbling something I think was about needing to take a piss. He walked outside and spotted me, a slick smile growing on his face. Anxiety plunged into my stomach.\n   \n*If I scream, Dad will hear me. If I scream, Dad will hear me. If I scream-*\n   \n“Hey Sweetheart, whatcha doin’ out here?”\n   \nI swallowed. “Hey Dale.”\n   \n“Nice of you to join us in the living room this mornin.”\n   \nI looked over at the hand of his I bit. The bitemark wasn’t fully hidden by his sleeve. He noticed me looking and put his hand up to his chest.\n   \n“About yesterday, I know-”\n   \n“I’m sorry.” I blurted.\n   \n“What?”\n   \n“I’m sorry Dale. I knew you were just playing. I shouldn’t have done that. It was wrong and I’m sorry, I- I really am…” \n   \nHe looked surprised, but then his smile grew wider. It reminded me of a cat after it’s caught its prey.\n   \n“Oh Sweetheart, it’s alright. I forgive you.”\n   \n“N-no, it’s not. I-I know I was wrong to do that. I should have been… more understanding. It must have hurt right?” \n   \n“It hurt a lot, it really did. I couldn’t even sleep last night ‘cause of the pain. Did you know that kissing a booboo makes-”\n   \n“I want to make it up to you. I um, I made you a gift. It’s special. Are you Babysitting tonight?”\n   \n“Of course I am.”\n   \n“Good. I’ll give it to you then. Oh, but it’s uh, the gift, you can’t tell anyone about it. Since it’s special. Not even Dad. I… it’s a special surprise, only for you, you know?. And you’ll have to wait ‘till it’s dark for it. You understand?”\n\nI was terrified he’d notice how off my voice sounded, but instead he just nodded, eyes lighting up in understanding. His grin grew wider and he looked me up and down. I wanted to scream, but I held it in.\n   \n“That’s wonderful. I can’t wait, Sweetie.”\n\n...\n\nAs the sky started turning into a wash of orange and red, like clockwork, Dad got up and stretched, ready to head for the pub.\n   \n“Be back.” He grumbled, grabbing his keys.\n   \n“Have a good time. Here- treat yourself tonight.”\n   \nDale pulled out some cash from his slimy jeans and handed it to him. \n   \nDad smiled. “Thanks Dale.”\n  \nDisgust filled my stomach. I’m sure Dad thought Dale was just being a kind older brother, but I knew his real intention. He wanted him gone as long as possible for tonight.\n   \nHe walked Dad out and waved him off as he left for the bar, then came back in.\n   \nThe look he had when he came back in made me want to run right then and there. He was grinning from ear to ear, looking as if he was finally about to eat a piece of dessert he’d been saving for a while.\n   \n“Sweetheart…” He cooed, coming closer to me, like a panther slowly zeroing in on his prey, positioning itself for the pounce.\n   “Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart…”\n    \nI jumped up from the couch. “Your present! I need to give your present!” I nearly shrieked, trying to subdue the panic in my voice.\n   \n“It’s outside! Remember, in the woods, I told you. W-we need to go out and get it.”\n   \nHe stopped, looking amused. “Alright then Sweetheart, if you want to do it that way, I’ll play ball.”\n   \nHe quickly grabbed my hand, forcing his fingers to interlock with mine. I resisted the urge to yank it away.\n   \n“Lead the way.”\n   \nAnxiety coursing through my insides, I led him outside and we started heading towards the tree line. Unfortunately however, the yard was long and Dale was impatient. As we walked, he started rubbing his thumb against the backside of my hand.\n   \n“Can I have my present now?” He said, yanking me back as we were almost across the yard.\n   \n“No!” I said, yanking forward. “Wait we're almost there!”  \n   \n*I have to get past the tree line, I have to get the tree line.* Sarah warned me that her domain only reached as far as the tree line.\n   \n“I want my present now.” He said, continuing to grab at me.\n   \n“Please!” I said, the panic now clear in my voice.\n   \n“Don’t be so difficult.” His tone was demanding.\n   \nWe struggled right at the edge of the yard, and our steps grew fewer and fewer. Terror enveloped me and tears sprung from my face as I twisted helplessly. Just as Dale grabbed my hair I heard it.\n   \nIt was the sound of my mother’s voice singing.\n   \nThe tone was low, unearthly and beautiful. An old rendition of a nursery rhyme my mother used to sing me as I fell asleep. Sarah, in the form of my mother and dressed in her old flower dress, stood a few yards away. The light of the now rising moon illuminated her figure through the gap in the trees, making her look ethereal. \n   \nDale stared at her transfixed before letting go of my hair. Then his face erupted into the most disgusting smile I have ever seen.\n   \n“Hey there Sweetheart, whatcha doin out so late?” He said, but he wasn’t talking to me. He was staring at Sarah. Sarah didn’t respond, just continued to quietly hum her beautiful tune.\n   \n“Does your Mommy know you’re out here so late?... Sweetheart, where are your clothes?”\n   \nHe took off his shirt and eagerly started walking towards her.\n   \n“Put this on sweetheart, it’s chilly. How old are you? It isn’t safe for you out here you know. Come here, don’t worry. I’ll help you....”\n   \nHe wrapped this arm around Sarah’s waist. Sarah grabbed his arm and started leading him into the woods. Before she did however, she looked back at me. Her brown eyes shone almost gold in the moonlight. They were cold, predatory looking. Her face looked inhuman and feral. It sent shivers down my spine. As close as we were, right now I felt as if she could seriously harm me if I approached her. It was time for me to leave. I ran back to the house and locked the door. Then I went into my room and hid under my covers, shivering like a baby animal...\n   \nDale didn’t come back the next day. Or the next, or the next, or the next. Dad started to get worried. He eventually called the police. As the last person to see him alive I was asked multiple times by both Dad and the police about what happened that night. I adamantly stuck to my story that Dale and I had watched T.V together until I went to bed, and I hadn’t seen him after that. I was terrified they’d catch on that I was lying, but they didn’t press me too much. After all, it’s not like a ten year old kid would be involved with a disappearance case. The investigation never ended up getting anywhere.\n   \nI only asked what happened to Dale once, mostly out of nervousness the police would find him and somehow connect it back to us. Miss Sarah just smiled.\n   \n“Made into fun little chunk sizes…”\n   \nIt’s been years now since that incident. I started school at the end of that summer, eventually graduated, and I’m now married with kids. That summer felt so long but now it feels as if time breezes by. I’m still in contact with my Dad but I keep the relationship at a distance. Ever since Dale died he’s been the same, but worse. He sits alone in his house all day, quietly drinking or leaving for the pub, no other joys or missions in life. I do feel a bit of pity for him, but it’s his life. As for Miss Sarah, we still keep in contact regularly. \n\nMy family and I live on the opposite side of the swamp so my Husband and kids get to see her fairly often. When I first introduced my Husband to her when we first got engaged. I was quite nervous, but he accepted her existence pretty well, and she, his. That’s when I knew he was the one. Usually I bring a picnic basket and we have a nice lunch together while the children play. Just like when I was little I like to tell her about my day and she still listens, quietly and contently. \n\nMiss Sarah may not be my mom, but she will always be my family.",

And so, I followed her, always present but never seen.\n\nAt first, she was unaware of my presence. But as the days passed, I could sense that she knew I was there. She would turn and look in my direction, as if she could see me standing in the shadows.\n\nI longed to reveal myself to her, to let her know that I was there. But I knew that I couldn't. I was a ghost, a being trapped between worlds, unable to fully exist in the realm of the living.\n\nYet, despite this, I couldn't bring myself to leave her. She was a beacon of light in a dark world, and I was drawn to her like a moth to a flame. I wanted to protect her, to keep her safe from the dangers that lurked in the shadows.\n\nAnd so, I watched over her, always present but never seen. I was her guardian, her protector, her shadow self.\n\nBut then, one day, she discovered me. She saw me standing in the shadows, and she knew that I was the one who had been stalking her.\n\nShe was afraid at first, but as she learned more about me, she began to understand. She saw that I meant her no harm, and she accepted me for who I was.\n\nAnd so, we spent our days together, she and I, bound by the strange connection that we shared. We were two souls from different worlds, but we found a way to be together, if only in spirit. And in that, we found a happiness that we never could have imagined. But even as we basked in the warmth of our newfound bond, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this mystery than met the eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As it turned out, I was right.

She had been researching my past, and she had discovered  something that she knew I would want to hear  .\n\nI was stunned by what she was telling, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. But as she told me more, I began to realize that it was all true. And as I listened to her, I knew that I had to find a way to move on, to finally rest in peace and leave this world behind.\n\nAnd so, with her help, I began to say goodbye. It was a difficult journey, but it was one that I knew I had to take. And as I left this world behind, I knew that I would always be grateful to the young woman who had helped me find my way.\n\nBut even as I passed into the next world, I couldn't help but wonder - what other secrets and mysteries lay hidden in the shadows, waiting to be discovered?",

        "text": "Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zzkc0x/the_hellion_rebellion/\n\nPart 2: The next two days torture was exactly as one would expect in hell. They were awful. The first day I received an slow acid bath that took most of my skin within the first twelve minutes. I passed out around thirty minutes in. \n\nThe next day was worse. They turned on some kind of heat lamp that brought a whole new meaning to the term burn in hell. I stayed awake a lot longer during that one. Even with my feet blistering and my skin cooking and melting until it was black and charred like a fuckin burnt hot dog. I managed to stay awake for seven hours.\n\nIt was when I woke up from being cooked, that I found myself face to face with Mr. Saxon. He was wearing a pressed suit. He looked at his watch and then me. \n“Mr. Stone…. You’re showing improvement fast. I’m impressed.” \nI groaned as I sloshed around in the translucent slime. I looked at my hand as the sticky substance had gotten between my fingers. I wondered what this stuff was. It was as if Saxon could read my mind.\n\n“It’s from the flesh pits. It’s the substance that in which the bodies are grown in. It helps grievous wounds heal faster. So we can get you back to your suffering.”\nI looked him up and down. Noticing the suit. He seemingly read my mind again. \n“The King of Gehenna is having a party tonight. A banquet in honor of the success of his newest Earthly project. Something someone close to you played a huge hand in seeing to fruition. You know, Operation Lazarus.” \nI watched at him with a shocked look in my eyes. He only smiled at me. \n“Of course. Your memories aren’t all intact yet. I do, however, have orders to bring your cell up to the King’s banquet hall for a uhhh… Well, you’re gonna be the guest of honor.” \nI stood in awestricken silence for a moment. I was a guest of honor for a banquet? In hell? For a moment I thought Saxon was playing a prank on me. So now what? I was to go and party with Lucifer? \n\nSaxon took a deep breath. \n“Before we go. There are some rules I would have you follow. Number one…. Don’t speak unless spoken too. Number two… If you see someone who triggers a flashback, don’t let it turn into a violent rage episode. If you embarrass me in front of the King or any of the nine princes, I’ll increase your suffering twentyfold! You understand me?”\n“Uhh, Yes?” I said.\n“Yes, what?” Saxon sneered. \nI took a deep long breath. \n“Yes…. Master!” I replied. \nSaxon smiled at me. \n“Very good!” \n\n\n\nHell’s banquet hall was a helluva lot scarier then I’d imagined. Saxon had snapped his clawed fingers and we’d suddenly found ourselves at the front gate to a large obsidian wall. It was hundreds of feet high. My eyes drifted upwards at the blood red sky that poured a red tint over everything. I looked up at the gate. It was made from a crude black metal and ornate with a simple carving of a horned dragon. \nMy eyes scanned the top of the walls, where I saw what looked like humanoid silhouettes. They were draped in crimson and held spears and shields. But that was all I could make out. In my mind I pondered whether or not they were souls assigned a function or actual demons. Saxon walked up to the door and knocked twice. \n\n“It’s Saxon.. Master of the Damned on level five.” \n\nThe doors opened slowly and Saxon turned to look at me. He smiled widely as he spread his arms out wide. \n“Welcome to the City of Dis!” \n\nHis slaves pushed my glass cell through the front gates of the city. The first thing that caught my eye were the buildings. They were all massive and made from the same obsidian metal as the walls. Most were formed into jagged and unnatural shapes. The streets were paved out of the same stone. The more I looked around, the more I realized that the city itself had been cut from a singular rock. All the buildings were connected to the ground but there was no seam line between them. This place wasn’t built, it was carved. There were no citizens on the street. For such a giant city, the place was practically empty. All was quiet aside from the grunts of Saxon’s slaves behind me.\n\nI was taken to the main palace in the center of the city. It was a massive black pyramid that’s point was miles up in the sky. It was by far the largest structure I’d ever seen. I started to sit down in my cell. When Saxon turned to me with a glare that told me to get back to my feet. \n\nI was pushed into an triangular shaped opening in the side of the pyramid. One that, on the outside, looked to lead into a dark void. I was hesitant about going in. But it wasn’t like I had a choice. I was pushed through and immediately after passing the darkened threshold, I found myself in a large room. My cell was flanked on either side by more slaves. But these ones weren’t like Saxon’s. I mean, they wore the same collars. But these ones were all naked and disheveled females. All of which looked like they’d just come out of some kind of orgy.\nSaxon examined them with a look of disgust. \n“The harlots of Asmodeus.. They know little suffering,” he muttered as he waved the slaves pushing my cell forward. \n\nI was taken into a large ballroom. Where the creatures of the night awaited me. There was a long black table in the center. None of the creatures were seated though. They were all congregated around the room. The creatures came in all shapes and sizes. Some of them looked to me like humanoid creatures with various demon like features. Some had horns and goat feet. Others had the top half of a human conjoined with the bottom half of a serpent. Some had multiple arms. Some had the features of a lizard similar to Saxon himself. I wanted to curse under my breath, but I knew that it would be a bad idea. \n\nA woman with four arms, whose bottom half was that of a serpent slithered straight up to Saxon, before straightening her body up in front of him. If not for her savage mutations or demon features, she could have been a beautiful woman. Her hair was silver and long. Her lips red and her eyes seemed to glow green. \n\n“Princess Azazel.” Saxon greeted with a slight bow. \n“Master Saxon. What is thissss…. Snack you’ve bought into our banquet hall?” she asked as she eyed me. \n“This is the king’s special guest.. David Stone.” \n\nAzazel eyed me up and down as she slithered her dark red snake like body around my cell. \n\n“He looks so delicious.. Can I try him?” she asked. \n\nSaxon laughed. “That would be up to the King.” \n\n“Ohhh, Saxon… Just a tiny bite?” She asked as her snakelike features suddenly started to disappear. Her tail seemed to melt as her extra arms seemed to fold into her. She was shapeshifting into a more human like appearance. \n“Princess Azazel, you’re not to eat my slave.” Saxon said with a bit more boom in his voice.\n\nAzazel ignored him, however as she looked at my crotch with a smile. She adjusted her black dress as she turned to him. \n“Can I at least fuck him?” she asked. \n\nSaxon raised a brow as he turned to look at me. I had an already shocked look on my face. I could feel this bodies new heart pounding away in my chest. \n\n“Not…. Right now.” Saxon said. \n\n“Shame..” she said as she turned and waved at me before walking back towards the table. \n\nSaxon turned and looked at me with a smile. \n“Don’t get any ideas. She’d eat you the moment she finished. Like a fucking black widow. Of course, I’m sure if this goes well she’d probably buy you.” \n\nI looked past him at another glass box that was being wheeled inside across the room. This one held another man who was on the heavier side. He wasn’t fat but he wasn’t muscular either. His whole body was shaven like mine. His most discernible feature was his large nose. His eyes caught mine, there was a hint of realization in them. His face contorted as I watched him mouth my name. \n“You recognize him?” asked Saxon.\n\n“No, Master,” I replied. \n\n“This may help. He was your old boss.” \n\nImages flashed through my mind. The next thing I knew I was sitting at a desk fresh out of the United States Army. A man sat across from me with a thick head of black hair that’d been jelled backward. A stone cold look in his eyes and that exact same nose. \n“So what makes you think you have what it takes to join the CIA?” He asked. \n\n“Shaw..” I said to myself. \n\n“Yesss, he’s been staying on level six with Master Raz,” said Saxon as he motioned the slaves to pull me forward. \nSaxon met Raz at one end of the room. Raz looked almost exactly like him, just instead of being white, he was a weird gray color. They seemed to carefully avoid the others as they met. Shaw stared at me from his cell as we were lined up next to each other. I tried not to look at him not to speak to him. I knew we’d both be punished if I did.\n\t\nI watched the demons in the room all suddenly start taking more human like appearances. That was when I started counting. There were nine male and seven female demons. Not including Saxon and Raz. They all started methodically taking their seats. That was when another glass box was pushed into the room. This one containing another man who looked Hispanic to me. But, unlike any of the other prisoners I’d seen. He had a feathery snake tattooed across his back. He also was the only one I’d seen with long greying black messy hair and a thick beard. \n\n“Whose that?” asked Saxon. \n“Hector Morales. He would have been inducted into our free reign denizen class for his efforts on earth. But he tried to fight Victor the moment they locked eyes.” Raz said quietly. \n\nHector’s cell was pushed right next to ours. He didn’t look at either of us. He just buried his face in the back corner of his box. I turned back to look at Shaw. The man was still staring at me intently. I took a deep breath as I let my mind wander. My thought process was suddenly cut off by a loud deep horn. My eyes were drawn to the big iron doors that sat just beyond the head of the table.\n \nA demon stood there with a large red horn in his hand. The doors were opening slowly behind him. It was almost ominous, the room was eerily silent aside from the slow footsteps coming our direction. My eyes glanced down towards Saxon, who was kneeling. I looked back up at the doorway. Where a familiar looking man in a suit stepped out with a happy expression across his face. He was kind of far away from me, but I could still make out his facial features. He had jet black hair that was gelled straight backwards. His go tee was thin. He had a strong jawline as well as a decently built frame. His eyes met mine as he calmly took his place at the head of the table. \n\n“My King! Lord Abbadon! Savior of Gehenna! How gracious of you to bless us with your presence!” one of the demons voices called out. I wasn’t sure which face it came from. I was focused on the king. \n“Shut up Pazuzu!” the King said with a sly smile as he looked upon his subjects. His gaze fell upon Azazel.\n\n“It seems things have been running smoothly in my absence. I’m almost impressed.” \n\n“Almost?” asked Azazel.\n\n“Yes. Well, energy output from the the sixth and eighth levels are down roughly three percent. I mean, it’s not a big deal. Especially since the other seven levels are all up. Especially level seven!” he said with a smile. \n\n“A sixteen percent increase in output within the last two years! I do believe that’s a new record!”\n\n“That isn’t a fair assessment. We are getting an influx of wrathful souls on that level! Lots of violent people have been dying lately!” said another demon. This one a bald man in a suit. \n\nThe King’s eyes shot over to the Prince. \n“Prince Baal! Tell me, what kind of suffering are you imposing on those damned souls on the sixth level?” \n“Same as everyone else, we have the torture boxes.”\n“The same torture boxes as everyone else but a decrease in production? Why is that?” Abbadon asked with a tilted head. \n“I-I…” Baal started. \n“Because you’re not pushing your masters hard enough to get the job done! They’re unmotivated! Lazy!”\n“We aren’t getting the same soul influx!”\n“You don’t need the same soul influx! There are billions on your level! Make them suffer! Or I’ll get someone who can!” \nBaal exhaled as he leaned back in his chair. \n“Yes, My Lord!” \n\nAbbadon leaned back as his eyes scanned the room. He smiled at me. Then his eyes went back to his subjects again. \n\n“Anyway, I didn’t come all the way back to Gehenna to talk business! I came here to celebrate! And celebrate we shall!” He said as he clapped his hands. \n\nSeveral slaves that’d been dressed like waiters at a fancy restaurant came out with platters of what looked to me like steaming severed arms and legs. One even put a plate in the center of the of the table that contained a roasted human head with an apple in his mouth. I wanted to hurl at the mere sight of this. But I couldn’t hurl up anything if I tried because my body didn’t need to eat anything. \n“I sure do love the flesh pits!” Azazel said as she poked at the severed arm on her plate. \n\n“Tell me, what was this slaves name?” asked another demon. \n“Please, I don’t get their names! They’re only numbers to me! I’m not like Asmodeus!” Azazel replied with a laugh. \nAbbadon raised a brow at this. A slave walked up behind him and whispered something in his ear. He stood at the end of the table.\n\n“Finally! The flesh pits have finished casting bodies for our newest associates! I want to introduce you guys to the newest General of our armies.” he said as he raised a wine glass full of human blood. \n\nA figure marched out of the tunnel behind him. It looked like an older looking man with white hair that was combed to one side. He wore a crude black chest plate with black robes underneath. On his back sat two red bat-like wings that were folded into place. He had a sword on his hip and a stern look in his eye. \n\n“Newest General?” asked Azazel.\n“He is to be my new right hand! He will answer only to me! He will be my vessel while I am away.”\n“And who is this man?” asked Baal. \n“This is the now fallen Angel that made our plans on earth work. This is Victor!” \n\nAll of the demons stared at him for a second. I watched the newly appointed General. My mind already ripe with a new memory. This one of a cellphone with Victor’s image on it. I’d been doing research for days on Gideon Pharmaceuticals. I was sitting what I think was a safe house. I was on the run from them. They’d sent mercenaries after me. I just couldn’t remember why. At least, not until Abbadon cut my thought process off. \n\n“And this… Is another who worked for me. He was one of the first to try our version of the Horseman’s Omega serum!” he said as a Hispanic man in an all white suit walked out behind him and stood next to Victor. His hands crossed at his waist. \n“This is Estevez. He will be the newest game master on level seven! Do you understand? Azazel?”\n\nAzazel stood up and examined the man closely. Abbadon watched her with a smirk. Azazel nodded as she circled him. She sniffed the air and then walked back towards her seat. \n“He will do! Anyone’s better the my last game master anyway!” \n\n“Perfect!” Abbadon said as he clapped once. “Then, last, but certainly not least. We have the Ripper himself. Jackson. He’ll make a fine addition to our forces down here.” Abbadon said as his eyes glanced up at me. \nThat was when I saw him. The man that made everything come flooding back. Flashes of Ana, the woman who bore my child. Her body lifeless and cold in my arms. Her emerald eyes void and empty. Her life taken by the very man that stood at the end of the table. I could feel my body tremble with rage. The flashes continued. I could remember it all. All the destruction that is caused in the Shadow Wars. \n\nLeaving the CIA to be with Ana. My daughter… Father Raphael and I had been protecting her. A young woman who hadn’t even made it out of her teens yet. A woman who was the key to uniting our species. A young woman, that I gave my life to protect. Jackson had killed me. Or I had killed myself trying to take his life. I could see his eyes move up and meet mine again. He smiled widely. As did Abbadon. Had I not known some semblance of self preservation. I’d have tried to break the box to go after him. To choke whatever afterlife he had out of him. I don’t remember anything else that was said by Abbadon. My eyes were locked solely on the smiling vampire that stood before me. Abbadon and his subjects went on talking. Jackson walked up to me with a smug look in his eyes. He stood at the edge of my glass box. Saxon stood behind him with a somewhat worried expression on his face.\n\n“Hello, David!” Jackson said through a wicked smile. His teeth had somehow looked even sharper than they had before. \n\nI looked at Saxon. Who only nodded calmly at me. \n“What do you want?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing. I’m dead. It’s strange, isn’t it?” he asked. \nI didn’t respond. Which only made him chuckle a bit. He leaned on my torture box.\n“Let me ask you something, Mr. Stone? How on earth did you end up here? I mean, other than the complete genocide of my species… I thought you fought for the good guys!” \n\nI again didn’t answer. I only glared at him. My thoughts were ever consumed with ways to make this being suffer. Jackson smiled as he turned back to Saxon. \n“You must have done a number on him. The man I knew on earth would have tried to kill me at least twice by now!” \n\n“He suffers like the rest of my flock!” Saxon answered.\nJackson turned back to me and smiled even wider. \n\n“You see your wife yet? She must be down here somewhere!”\nMy eyes widened with rage as I started to take a step forward. \n“Mr. Stone!” Saxon growled. \n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. My hands clenched into tight fists. \n“That is enough for now. If you wanna gloat, come to our level after the banquet.” Saxon said as he eyed Jackson. \n\nJackson smirked at Saxon, and then grinned at me. I exhaled as I looked up and past Jackson. Abbadon sat there watching me with an intrigued look in his eyes. One that honestly sent a shudder down my spine. I quickly glanced back down at Jackson. Who was starting to walk away. \n\nThat was when Abbadon stood up and raised his wine glass. \n“A toast! To David’s daughter, without her sacrifice or her blood, none of what we’re trying to do would even be possible!” \n\nAll of the demons whooped and cheered. But it was all drowned out to me by the sudden agonizing realization that something had happened to her. Something had happened to my little girl. Something that I’d payed the ultimate price to prevent. I could feel tears welling up as my legs turned into jelly. I dropped to my knees. My eyes staring ahead but focusing on nothing.\n\n“Oh look! His torture box is charging!!” Raz said as he nudged Saxon. \nI could see Saxon rub his chin with intrigue. \n“Well, would you look at that!” \n\nAll this did, however, was get Abbadon’s attention.\n“Ohh! David! David! David!” Abbadon said as he approached my cell. \n\n“You should be honored! Her suffering benefited the greater good! In time… All of humanity will be made better. They will become the very things that they were meant to be. And it’s all thanks to your daughter. They’ll all serve their purpose for a better, and more prosperous Gehenna!”\n\nI could feel the sorrow in my gut turning into rage. It burned like the fires of the very plane of existence that I stood on. I gritted my teeth as I got to my feet. \n\t\n“David!” I could hear Saxon growl.\n\n“I think the slave has something to say! Well then, let’s hear it!” Abbadon said with a calm look in his eye.\n\n“I’m going to get out of this box. I don’t care if it takes me a hundred days or a hundred years. But when I do, I’m gonna fucking kill every one of you ungodly abominations. Starting with you!” I said as I looked at Jackson. \n\nThe vampire smiled sheepishly at me. Which I can remember finding odd in the moment. Abbadon turned to Jackson, and then he looked around the room. The whole place erupted in hysterical laughter. He smirked as he turned to me. \n\n“You have drive. I respect that. You humans, some of you at least, have balls that none here could muster within a thousand years. I like you. You have what we call… Potential. I may even make you a member of our military one day. But first, unfortunately, you need to be taught. You must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated.” He turned to Saxon and nodded.\n\nThe next thing I knew I was being electrocuted, pulses of an electric current tore through every muscle in my body. I stood there as long as I could, glaring at Abbadon. He smirked as Saxon upped the voltage, the next thing I knew I had fallen to my knees. But I didn’t cry out. I didn’t beg. I only stared at the king of hell. The rage I felt towards him keeping me conscious. That was, until the spike went through my skull. \n\n\n“You should have listened to me,” Saxon’s voice said softly as I came too. \n\nI was back in my cells slot. Back on level five. I groaned as I started to move around. Only to find very quickly that my arms and legs were tied up and stretched in differing directions. My body suspended a few feet above the ground if my cage. I grunted as I fought against the chains holding me in place.\n\n“You embarrassed me in front of the king! Now, now you gotta pay! Now, you’re my new favorite prisoner! And you’re gonna learn respect!” \n\nAn electric current ripped into me through my wrists and ankles. I winced as my muscles tightened. He stepped closer to the glass. \n\n“Making threats against the king! I don’t know who you think you are!” He growled as another current ripped through me. \nI wasn’t gonna give him the satisfaction of watching me scream though. All I could think about was getting out of here so I could get my hands around his throat. I think he read my mind. Because the next thing I knew, the wires holding me suddenly dropped me on the floor. \n\n“Okay David… If you think you’re violent enough to escape. Let’s see. Bring in the dogs!”\n\nI could hear them before I could see them. The snipping of jaws. The growling, and barking. The slaves were struggling to hold back the hellhouds. It took four slaves to hold one dog. The dogs were huge, at least the size of horses. They looked like black wolves with red glowing eyes and matted blood in their fur. The side of my cell opened. Saxon took a step backward as the two hounds filled the entrance. Both salivating and drooling as they looked at their next meal. Which just so happened to be me. I gritted my teeth as I stood ready for the onslaught. The slaves struggled to hold the hell hounds back as they bit and snapped at me. \n\n“Now… Mr. Stone, please try not to scream!” Saxon barked as he nodded to the slaves. \n\nThe dogs came at me fast and hard. I put my hands up to block the incoming jaws of one. The teeth practically snapped my arm as they clamped down. I shoved my thumb into its eyeball. The creature whimpered as it fumbled backward. But that was when the other jumped on top of me. I think I managed to get a few shots in, but the last thing I remembered was being covered in cuts and blood as jaws clamped down on my face. \n\nI woke up a few hours later in brutal agonizing pain. Everything that could hurt, did hurt. It took me a full minute to get my bearings as I looked down. My intestines were being yanked out by a hungry wolf. It tugged and tugged, as it did more searing pain ripped through me. I discovered both my arms had been torn off and one of my legs was hanging on by a piece of meat. My remaining eye looked past the Wolf at Saxon. Who was staring at me with a serious glint in his eye. I honestly wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. There was a hole where my throat used to be.\n\n“Pull them back.” Saxon said sharply. \nThe slaves yanked the wolves backward until they were out of the cell. One even took the rest of my intestines with it. Saxon calmly stepped into my now blood spattered cell. \n\n“This is just the first day.” He said as he squatted down in front of me. \n\n“I see that physical pain doesn’t cause you as much suffering as it should. That’s fine, I want you to know, however, that we found your ex wife.. She’s on level two. I’m gonna have her brought up here in the morning. Then I’m going to make you watch what I do with her.” \n\nI could feel my heart flutter as my insides boiled with rage. I started to struggle, but it was all for nought. Saxon only grinned as he stood up, and then walked away. \n\n\nA little while later, I found myself in the healing solution from the flesh pits. My wounds were grievous from the hellhounds. Dwayne stood watching me from his cell with his arms crossed. A look of pity was plastered across his face. \n\n“I warned you! About becoming the favorite!”\n\n“I know..” I replied.\n\n I’d say I was listening to what he said but my mind was on one thing. They were bringing my wife up soon for some kind of sick game. A game that they expected me to play. I remembered that the slaves would come get me. I’d already made the plan in my mind. I was getting out of here.",

        "text": "         So this is a little long and I'm sorry for that. I truly am, but the powers that be recently gave me permission to share my tales so… here we go. I know the stories I am about to share may seem impossible they are true. All of them.My story, and in turn my life really started the day I died. Up until then I hadn't really done much of anything with my life. Nothing really important anyways. But that day in particular I woke up very, very confused, and suddenly standing on what looked like the ambassador bridge. Like I was just out of nowhere on a bridge halfway between Detroit and Windsor. I didn't know how I got here or what was going on so I immediately attempted to remedy the situation by shouting and screaming like a banshee in heat.\n\n\"What the fuck!! Omg how did I get here?\" I blubbered. It was blank. Like someone took an eraser to my memories and now there were just missing spots. How I got here was one of those.  The last thing I remember was getting into my car to go to the dispensary to get a bag of weed. Really good weed by the way. But that's the thing. I don't drink or do hard drugs. Ever! Ime and my best friend Kylie only ever smoked weed. A lot of times with my hippie mother. I remember getting our sundries for our weekly Netflix Marathon with my Mom. I remember her asking me and Kylie to stop at Home Depot and pick her up some pain brushes for a project she was working on. My Mom was actually a pretty successful local artist. She was really good at what she did and I was always proud of not a little envious. Not that I was jealous just….I never had the focus or talent she did. But she was amazing and kind and no one ever had a bad word to say about her me included. She was my Rock, Kylie's too  Kylie lived with us all though highschool and college because her parents were methheads and my Mom fought for custody once they almost blew up there house awith Kylie in it when we were 7. You guessed they were making a methlab give yourself a cookie because you'd be absolutely right! So that day forward Kylie was ours. Through the years nothing has ever changed our bond. \n\npulling into Home Depot is the last memory I have, then nothing and now here I am. On a goddamn suspension bridge between the US and Canadian border!! I started to panic. No, no panic doesn't adequately describe what I was doing. I was full fledged freaking the fuck out, and believe me you would too! Just as I was about the completely lose my shit,  A small, black haired, dark skinned man appeared next to me  \"Breath Madison breath. It's ok. My name's Rhys. And I promise you're gonna be ok\". I screamed and backed away because what the fuck? He literally appeared out of nowhere. How was this supposed to \"calm me\"?  I realized I wasn't breathing. Something was tickling the back of my brain like a worm borrowing an idea that I didn't want to have.  I felt weird. Everything felt weird. I gulped out of fear and habit instead of necessity. Why didn't I need to swallow anymore? Why have I been holding my breath yet feel no urge to breathe? Ugly ideas burrowing. Things I needed to face yet didn't want to. Oh how I didn't want to.\n\n \"What happened? Where am I?\" I was dense sometimes but never stupid. There was a quiet in my body. No breathe, no heartbeat just silence. I didn't want to know the answer that was right there in front of my face. Little idea worm trying to get me to face what I just couldn't bring myself to do.\n\n    I was terrified and so my heart should've been going a mile a minute, there was no wild thumping in my chest. Like I said dense but never stupid. My body was dead silent. You don't realize how loud your body is until it is silenced. It's brings with it a quiet terror that sits in your very soul. I knew, but saying the words out loud was another thing. It made it real. I didn't want this to be real. Rhys looked at me in a way that said he was waiting for me to figure it out. \"What do you think happened Madison?\" \n\n     Instead of answering calmly with the fact that I was pretty sure I was dead I just started keen up at the sky in a way that wasn't at all over dramatic before spitting out my worst fear brought to life \"Im dead aren't I? Oh God I have to be dead. My body is SO quiet. Oh no what about my Mom and my Dog\" I choked \"I have so much I was gonna do-Im so young practically a baby!\" I sobbed.\n\n \"you're 38!\" He said starting to look bored. \"As in 2 years til 40!\"\n\n\"I know\" I wailed \"I'm a baby\" a baby that doesn't know sarcasm when she hears it! \n\n\"Little guardian angel I had so much more to do!\" He snapped his fingers in front of my face, which ok RUDE. On what planet had that ever worked to calm someone down. Instead he just continued in a haughty tone. \n\n\"Yes because you have already done so much with the gift you were given. Your actually really smart and haven't done shit with that either\" he muttered.\n\nWait what? Was this guy shaming me? On my death day no less. It's my fucking death day and this turd didn't even bring me a cake just made me feel stupid and small instead! \n\n \"Hey I'm young and still figuring shit out!\" \n\n\"You're 38\" he said again dryly \" seems you've had plenty of time to get your shit together and as far as I know you've done so by-\"\n\nHe looked at his tablet that appeared in his hands and rolled his eyes. \" Actually You haven't done much of anything. Good or Bad. You're lazy and irresponsible, you sleep around a bit and smoke weed more than you can afford, you do stupid and impulsive things without thinking.\" He sighed \"But while you're a real piece of work sometimes you aren't evil and apparently given enough time, again 38 years old but not my call, the powers that be feel that given enough time you would've done some good in this world.\"  I shifted from one foot to another. We'll Jeez Rhys you really know how to sweet talk a lady! If I'm such a Piece of shit why bother?\".\n\n\"Your Mom, Madison. When she had cancer you were her rock and any other time she needed you you showed up. You would die for Kylie and your dog Regan is basically your child. You would sacrifice yourself for that dog in a heartbeat. You volunteer at the local animal shelter and have managed to get every animal adopted. You worked tirelessly for the shelter to become a no kill shelter. You got Reagan on his last day to be euthanized before they became a no kill shelter. They believe you are more than meets the eye Madison and your love for Kylie your Mother and Reagan-wait why did you name him Regan?\" Rhys asked interrupting his diatribe.\n\n I shrugged suddenly not feeling as confident about the name as I once did. It seemed a lot more clever when I gave it to him.\n\n\"Ummm hmmm grrrmp\" I mumbled.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I said I named him Regan because he forgets stuff a lot…..much like our former president.\" I muttered louder but definitely not prouder.\n\n\"Wow Madison just wow!\" He said and to my amazement chuckled a bit and shook his head before continuing.\n\n\"Anyways THAT version of Madison the one that really shows up for her loved ones is who the gate keepers saw that you COULD become given enough time. Even though you are 38!!!\" he said. Again. I kept thinking I just need more time but 38 years of my bull-shitery was hard to undo.\n\n\"What does that even mean? Do you have to keep reminding me I'm closer to 40 than 30?   Actually you know what? What does it even matter at this point? I'm dead right? Oh and by the way who the fuck are you exactly? Are you an angel then? Can I call you Clarence?\"  \n\n  \"I'm not an Angel. Wait Clarence from it's a wonderful life? Seriously? And No you can't call me that\" \n\n\"Ok Clarence…..\"\n\n\"no Madison- Jesus your obnoxious-how about I call you George Baily? Or shit for brains? Hows that? You can't just change someones name.\" \n\n\"Seems like I just did\" I said. I was scared and confused so snark became my creed.\n\n\"Not happening GEORGE!\" \n\n\"Why George? Why not Mary Bailey do I look like a dude?\"\n\n\"No you look like and idiot on a bridge! Don't call me Clarence\" \n\n\"Clarence, Clarence Clarence shhhh shhhh shhh\" I cooed fucking with him further \"it's ok it's ok it's already done!\"\n\n\"Rhys, my name is Rhys!\" He said through gritted teeth all the while giving me a look that shut me up right and quick. Which is NOT something I always know when to do. Like reading the room? Not my thing! Now sticking my foot in my mouth? That's my jam!\n\nHe sighed obviously annoyed. \" Madison you didn't live a bad life but you didn't live a great one either and technically you weren't supposed to die today. But your guardian was um late and-\" \n\n\" wait I'm dead cuz of someone else's fuck up? Was it you? Are you my guardian? How did I even die? I don't remember! What the fuck kind of guardian Angel are you?\" I was getting worked up again and the more worked up I get the more snarky I get.\n\n\"Still not an Angel I'm a bridge keeper, which is not a guardian. That takes centuries and I would never fuck up the way your Angel did\" \n\nStory of my life I muttered. Centuries? Nothing weird there. Just a normal day hanging out with some other worldly being. Who was a haughty asshole.\n\nMy mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, which at this point I totally was. I swallowed another lump forming in my throat as I plunged forwards while trying not to completely lose my shit.\n\n  \"How long have I been dead? Is my Mom ok?  Did they have a funeral for me? I hope they played a lot of Taylor Swift\" Yea don't lie you know you love Taylor Swift! \"Oh no I'll never be part of her squad now!\" I dry sobbed. Clarence stared at me like the moron I was, before asking what I DID remember?\n\n\"I don't remember ANYTHING that's the problem! It's like hitting a brick wall. What the fuck Clarence?\" I rambled near hysterics. \"I'm too cute to be dead! My dimples are soooo deep, and I have so many adorable freckles\"\n\n I blubbered garnering another eye roll.\n\n\"Wow you're not vein or anything \" he said dishing out a little snark of his own. I waited for him to say something enlightening but Clarence just stared at me again. He studied me silently watching as I kept trying to cram a square peg into that round hole when something clicked. \"Clarence I'm not dead yet am I?\" I grabbed him and looked him square in the eyes, which wasn't hard because he was really short. \n\n\n\"What do you think Madison?\" He was infuriating. I grabbed him by the shoulder and looked him squarely in the face \"tell me or I will punch you in your fucking face\" I wouldn't have I don't like violence, but he doesn't know that. \"Ok ok you're in a coma but alive. You um….ok so you and your best friend-\" \n\n \"Kylie!\" I grinned. I was the Ethel to her Lucy, she was the Cheech to my Chong, and the- \n\n  \"Madison\" he said snapping his finger in front of my face. RUDE!\n\n\"Ok well do you wanna hear how you nearly bit the dust or are you going to keep staring off into space?\"\n\n I mean it really wasn't a question. \n\n\"I haven't decided yet\" I mumbled like a petulant child. I might've stomped my foot a tad but we don't need to talk about that.\n\nHe rolled his eyes again. One of these days they were gonna get stuck like that!\n\n\"You were in Home Depot\" he began \"and you, ahem it's rather embarrassing.\" he said in a way that made me not want to know anymore all while knowing 100% he was going to enjoy telling me.\n\nHe seemed to weigh his words carefully before diving right into the humiliating and really stupid act that landed me living it up in a coma.\n\n \"You guys decided to climb onto one the displays with those fancy Japanese toilets? You know the ones?\"\n\n\"Oh yea yea the ones that practically read you Harry Potter before bed and tell you your pretty when you feel fat!\"  \n\n \"Yea they don't do that\" He said dryly. \n\nIf I could I'd Google it just to prove a point!\n\nI really was pretty sure where this tale was going but I was still hoping it wasn't gonna end with me almost being murdered by a crapper. But as he continued all hope was lost because if you guessed right, then you know I was almost murdered by a crapper! You know a tale as old as time!\n\n\"Anyways you two geniuses climbed up and sat on them and were asking people going by for Toilet Paper or a magazine while you filmed it because you wanted  to become tik tok famous or some shit. I don't know! It's all ridiculous Madison!\"  Ok fair. He looked up from the tablet shaking his head \"Jesus Madison really? Again 38!!!  Anyways you fell off the display and the toilet followed and part of it hit you on the head. Kylie's fine but you're lucky to be alive. Also other people were recording it and so in a round about way you got your wish 'cuz that shit was all over social media!\" \n\n     Oh My God. For once I didn't have words. You know what kill me. Just kill me. I was basically almost murdered by own stupidiity and a toilet. Fuck me!l and that shit was all over social media. Omg I was gonna be know as crapper girl I just KNOW it!\n\n    \"They've been trying to get your mom to pull the plug and donate your organs but she's not budging. They say there's very little brain activity but after reading this I have to wonder how much was there to begin with\" oh haha!\n\n     At the mention of my sweet mother I burst into well not tears because I couldn't cry actual tesrs. If I died my Mom would fall apart. She was literally the only one besides Kylie who ever believed in me and saw past the 38 year old loser that let's face it, I was. I cried again which is so weird when there's no tears or ugly snot to cry. \"There, there\" Clarence said woodenly. He was really really awful at comforting people which just made me bawl harder. I was ugly crying so loud I almost didn't hear Clarence say \"There may be another option ok? So like you know calm down please\"\n\n Clarence you son of a gun you always know just the right things to say to a lady.\n\n I took a few deep breaths even though I didn't need to breathe but the act itself helped to calm me and it did…. a little….I mean not as much as some weed would but my guess was Mr. Judgy over there wasn't cool. He was rolling his eyes at me. Again. \"What?\"\n\n \"Weed? Right now really Madison? \" \n\n\"Hey it's legal here AND in Canada over there so…..wait did u read my mind? That's not ok!\" \n\n\"No I read your face\" \n\nhe said but I think he's full of shit because it was way too specific. I mean it's not like there were pot leaves dancing in my eyes. Right? But then again today's been a fucked up day so I wouldn't rule anything out either! Regardless though, highway to heaven over there wasn't spilling the tea on his X-Menish abilities! He wasn't an Angel? Well he damned well was SOMETHING. I wondered if Clarence had any weed on him but highly doubted it. He wasn't cool like that. Good God how I wished he was. A shot would be awesome too. I wasn't a drinker but today had been REALLY messed up! But Clarence didn't strike me as the type to have a flask or a blunt handy. Even if I did have either one or both of those things on hand myself captain judgy over there probably wouldn't be cool with it anyways. My ADD brain rambled and was wandering again, struggling to focus because oh my God wouldn't you? When Clarence cleared his throat which I had come to learn in the incredibly short amount of time I had known him meant \"listen up\" so for once I shut my mouth and did just that.\n\n    \"As I was saying there may be shall we say….another option?\" He snapped his fingers and a bench appeared. A bench in the middle of the Ambassador bridge to Canada. Ok maybe he was a little cool. We sat down on the bench. The bench that poofed in out of thin air cuz Clarence the grumpy Angel willed it. I expected a hard seat to meet my soft too much taco bell bum but instead it  felt like it was made out of pieces of Heaven itself. \"Can you focus Madison? I mean really focus?! This is important and you're zoning out. Pay attention he said clapping his hands in my face in a very obnoxious yet effective way.\"Your choices are these become a bridge keeper like me or pass away and I'll cross you over the bridge to your next destination.\" Simple and too the point that was our boy Clarence! \n\n\"As for how cool I am, there's a time and a place for everything and I am very cool girl. Cooler than you'll ever know.\" \n\n\"Cool people don't brag about being cool. Like how guys with small dicks are always the ones that brag the most about how big their noodles are, then he lets the trouser snake out it's just a sad little worm!\" I snarked back.\n\n\"Did you just refer to my dick as a noodle AND a trouser snake and a worm in the same sentence?\"\n\n\nI didn't answer that particular question because it seemed to be hypothetical. However I did manage to dazzle him yet again with my intelligence when I asked my next question \"The afterlife is in Canada?\" I said stupidly.  \n\nHe stared at me, clearly overwhelmed by my logic and brilliance.\n\n\"Do you ever think before you speak girl!?\" Clarence said exasperation evident. Maybe he wasn't so dazzled!\n\n\"No it's not Canada! Most of the time its just a bridge. But when it needs to be more it is. Most large bridges are also bridges to the shall we say great beyond. That's where we come in\" I noticed he was already using we and including me in his death bridge shenanigans!\n\n\"Are you paying attention? I don't have all day you know?!\" \n\n\"Jesus Christ Clarence, yes go on please your highness.\"\n\n\"It's Rhys\" He practically growled before continuing. \"When someone dies the bridge keepers cross them over. They usually cross over and it's onto the next grand adventure or whatever no prob,  but some don't. Their lives are too unfinished they don't know they died, or their destination is not yet written in the book of life. Those are harder to cross. It's a hard job but it's essential. We become the bridge keepers and help the souls crossover. At least most of them\" \n\n    I raised my hand like I was in class which this time garnered me yet a other eye roll. \"So we're reapers?\"  \n\n\"No we're bridge keepers\" still using \"we\" like we were a team or some bullshit. Although I was rarely picked for teams in school maybe this was an improvement? I dont know man like I said fucked up day.\n\n\"Bridge keeper Reapers! I'm a poet and didn't know it!\" I cheesed and Clarence sighed\n\n\"Yea fine whatever!\"\n\n\"Hey you said most?\" I said and he responded with \"huh\" \n\n\"a second ago you said you help at least MOST souls crossover, so what happens to the ones that don't or won't cross over??\" \n\nHe was quiet for a minute,a far away look in his eyes for a minute before answering It's not pretty that why it's important for souls to crossover. You'll see in…Riiiight about now!  Suddenly the cutest little old lady just this side of Betty White was standing before us. \"This is an easy one George\" he whispered. Haha Clarence now you're getting how this buddy cop shit goes!\n\n     \"Oh no it seems that I've found myself dead!!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you two my Angels?\" I barked a laugh and Clarence being the wild child he was just stared. \n\n\"I'm not and Clarence says he's not an Angel but secretly I think he's full of shit!\" I said garnering a sigh AND an eye roll. Bully for me!\n\n\"What my associate was trying to say was that yes you have found yourself dead as you put it.\" Clarence interjected.\n\nAssociate?. He was really pushing this shit.\n\n\"I'm sorry\" I said to her, not 100 percent sure of what I was actually apologizing for, but dead was shitty so….to my utter shock she patted me on the back gently. This woman was a mom a Nana, maybe even a great grandma. I knew it in everything about her as she reminded me so much of own Mom. There's just a certain way they have about them you know?\n\n\"Now no need to get all sad and mopey dear. What's you're name? Mine is Catherine\" She smelled like Jenate perfume.\n\n \"George Baily\"  Clarence answered. Touche Clarence touche!\n\n\"He's a liar it's Madison\" I said swallowing a laugh. That's Rhys but everyone calls him Clarence\" \n\n\"Oh like the Angel?\" She chirped and Clarence rubbed the bridge of his nose. \"So what now?\" She said and her eyes crinkled. I looked to Clarence and for once he didn't look annoyed. I wasn't sure what to do to be honest. \n\n\"Are you ready Catherine?\" He said gently. She looked around expectantly as if waiting for someone. \"Almost\" she said quietly and a smile soft and gentle appeared on her weathered face as her eyes fell on a figure in the distance.  When she turned back to us she was young almost painfully so. No more than 19 or 20. Her white hair fell in soft waves to her shoulder before it changed to a deep Auburn so red it put fall leaves to shame. She was dressed in a USO uniform and a wide red  smile stretched across her beaming face. \"My sweetheart is here to pick me up!\" She exclaimed her voice rich with the warmth of young love. They walked to each other, lovers reunited once again. With every step the withered old man took towards her the years fell away into a very young soldier. There was music from the 1940s playing. She turned to me, putting her arm around my shoulders. \"Now you are going to be alright Madison. No tears\" I was dry crying now but who's counting. \"I lived a good long life. I was 95 surround by everyone I loved.\" I was ugly crying again. But she gently kissed my forehead. \"You are rough around the edges I can see that about you but you have such a gentle heart. Look at you crying over an old lady you barely know. Death it just part of life Madison. Im thankful you brought me and my Reginald together again. Now you're going to be alright. Don't let sour puss over there influence you. You bring your heart to everyone you cross and you'll be just fine\"\n\n \"I can hear you\" Clarence said.\n\n \"I know that was the point sour puss\" I said giving Catherine a squeeze. \"You're date's waiting girl, go get your man!\" I said and she chuckled and gave me one final squeeze before turning to Reginald. As they walked to each other a soft glow surrounded them. Healthy and safe in each other's arms again. They started dancing a soft tune played as the lovers swayed and for once I had no words, no snark just awe as they slowly fade onto their next adventure together, wherever that may be.\n\n\"I'll do it\" I sloppy sobbed. I\" thought so\" said Clarence.\n\n\" How does this work-?\" He snapped his fingers I and suddenly I shot up in a hospital bed gasping. My Mother and Kylie who was asleep of two of those awful chairs shot up and started screaming for the Dr. \"Omg omg you're awake! You stupid stupid girl she sobbed\"\n\nMy mom was hugging me into near suffocation. And Kylie was apologizing and saying how stupid we were. Which is fair I mean I got beat the fuck up by a toilet! But I was awake I was still here and somehow I knew that the bridge wasn't a dream. \n\n     After much fuss and tears from my mom and my best friend, I was released two weeks later. My injuries were healing and at that point I wasn't even sure if maybe I had actually Wfever dreamed the whole damned thing. It seemed so far away.I had to move in with my Mom since I lost my apartment and job. But it was ok I'd been working on myself the last month seeing a therapist and just trying to get my shit together. Then today everything changed when the doorbell rang. I hobbled to it in my walking cast from the kitchen sink I was currently eating over. Because I was lazy and didn't feel like washing\n a dish. Anyways so I was eating my Sammy over the sink while law and order blared in the background (it's literally always in some channel)  and who should be standing on my doorstep like a little bundle of sunshine but Clarence!!!! \n\n\"Ready?\"\n\n\"Can we get Starbucks on the way? I asked.\n\n\"I prefer Dunkin but sure why not\" So it definitely wasn't a coma dream. \n\nWe stopped at Starbucks and he didn't even complain when I told them his name was Clarence so they wrote that on his little cup! Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. As we appeared on the bridge I realized for the first time in my life what I was doing mattered.\n\n\"Seriously Madison this isn't gonna work if you keep zoning off!\" But just like any job my boss is a dick sometimes. My name is Madison O'dey and with a sip of my coffee I waited to start my first shift as a bridge keeper. ",

        "text": "I'm not sure when my parents started digging a huge hole in our backyard. From what I've seen, at 11:07 PM they seem to drop whatever they are doing and start digging just making the hole deeper and deeper everyday, and the time they stop is 2:01 AM, afterwards both my mom and dad just go to sleep right away. I know about this because I watch them dig. Actually more like just watching the hole, by the time I saw them doing this, it was already too deep.\n\nWhenever I see it, curiosity always gets to me. I want to look inside the hole, see if there's anything interesting or important. And I'm wondering why they are even digging in the first place. The hole isn't that interesting, I don't know why I'm so curious about a hole in the first place,  it's just so weird and the fact my parents do this, plus they always start at a exact time, that's even more weird.\n\nYou know sometimes you can just tell when someone is lying? Well I'm getting the signs my parents lie every time about the true intentions about this hole. Same excuse as well, my mom and dad both say that they are digging for treasure, why would they think that I would believe that anyway, I'm seventeen going on eighteen, I'm not a kid. Plus, I've even asked if I could help dig, which each time the answer was no.\n\nI was getting more interested in the hole everyday. Whenever I saw it I had the urge to go outside and remove the tarp that covers it, and just hop straight down. Part of me wishes I could help dig the hole, and I want to see inside it so badly. Literally just have a timer set for the exact time so I can watch them descent into the hole.\n\nI couldn't wait any longer, at this point, I've grown an obsession with the hole, and my urge to actually go out finally succumbed.\n\nAt last, I went outside at 2:05 AM to see whatever was in the hole. I had to see, I couldn't wait any longer. So much time was wasted just watching and resisting it whenever I could've gone outside. First thing I did was remove the tarp, then I shined my phone's flashlight down the hole. \n\nAs expected, I saw nothing but darkness. I've never noticed a ladder before, suppose it makes sense considering it'd be impossible to get out. Except I've seen my parents just jump into the hole each time. Maybe there was a huge cushion to break their fall? Either way, I was too scared to jump so I spent an hour just making my descent.\n\nSo, I made it. I didn't have my light on so I saw nothing. Actually the ground didn't seem like dirt, I wasn't stepping on dirt, maybe stone. There was a horrid smell too. When I turned on my phone flashlight, I saw exactly 78 dead bodies, an assortment of them, from skeletons, decaying corpses, and some that looked extremely recent, I don't know . I was definitely shitting myself, what the fuck has been going on.\n\nThey weren't just some random people, each pair that still had flesh in the hole looked exactly like my mom and dad. I'm in disbelief, I never imagined something like this, a part of me thought maybe it was some underground bunker.\n\nHow is this even possible? To die multiple times? If my parents are dead, who the fuck is the people asleep in the house right now.",

        "text": "[There are rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zw5djj/how_to_survive_college_obviously_i_get_to_be_bait/)  Of course there are rules.  We want life to make sense.  We want bad things to happen only to people who deserve bad things.  If we can believe the world operates according to the laws of fairness, then we don’t have to be so scared of a chaotic world, cruelly indifferent to right and wrong, just and unjust.  \n\nSo when something unnatural - these manifestations of our fears and our hopes - drags someone into the darkness, we find a reason that this happened.  Just as breaking a mirror brings bad luck, so can a messy house or poor hospitality bring destruction.\n\nWe die because we earned it.\n\nThere was trespass.\n\nA taboo was violated.\n\nA rule was broken.\n\nThis university may not follow the *traditional* rules, but it is not exempt from this condition.  College students probably adhere to the concept of deserving what happens to you more than most.  We earn our grades, after all.  So there *are* rules.  And we are going to get the flickering man to break them.\n\nThat is our plan.\n\n (if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/)) \n\nOf course, I don’t know all the rules yet, and the laundry lady is loath to share.  Despite our current alliance, we’re still technically on opposite sides here.  I’d get rid of her if I knew how and she’d get rid of me if she were permitted to.  She wasn’t willing to give me any more information than she absolutely had to.\n\nBesides, she told me, it wasn’t relevant to our goal.  We wanted the flickering man to go after me *without* his rule being violated.  That’d get someone’s attention.  \n\n“Go out in the rain,” she told me, “just long enough to get his attention.  Then seek shelter and wait.”\n\n“And then what?” I asked.  “He makes an attempt to kill me and… they get rid of him?”\n\nWe were still meeting in the dorm laundry room.  She was always there when I entered, which made me think she was either waiting for me or somehow knew when I was coming.  I tried to pick odd times so that we wouldn’t have anyone walk in while we were talking.  I didn’t want people to start thinking she’s my mom or something.\n\n“I don’t actually know,” she said thoughtfully.  “They can’t do to him what they did to me.”\n\n“What did they do to you?”\n\nShe had mentioned briefly that I’d gotten her into some kind of trouble, but had stubbornly refused to elaborate.  This time was no different.  She ignored me.\n\n“Snatching the odd student here and there outside the rules isn’t usually enough to anger them.  It’s unusual though, because we…” \n\nShe hesitated, searching for words.  Even though she was certainly the most humanlike of the creatures I’d encountered so far, she was still inhuman and our experiences could not be easily translated.\n\n“...it doesn’t sustain us.  And I don’t mean it’s the difference between a real meal and a handful of stale peanuts you find in your pocket.  It… doesn’t fit.  Like eating gravel just so your stomach doesn’t feel so empty.”\n\nI told her that I understood well enough.  And I think I do.  These creatures can’t change themselves like humans can.  We can reflect and make choices and become different people if we set our minds to it.  We have a will.  The inhuman, however, have no such ability.  Going against their nature would be like one of us trying to evolve to breathe water.\n\nI wonder if an inhuman could… unmake themselves… if they defy what they are often enough.\n\n“Anyway,” she continued, “if the flickering man attacks you without you having broken his rules, then that means something else is going on.  He’s either starving - unlikely - or he’s got a grudge.”\n\n“And that will be enough to upset the administration?”\n\n“That’s my hope.  They might turn a blind eye to one attempt, but if he *keeps* trying they’ll be forced to take action.”\n\nHe’s already made one attempt.  The devil intervened, so I had to assume that meant that the flickering man was violating his own rules.  After all, the devil is a stickler for rules.  If the flickering man had any legitimate claim on my life, I doubted the devil would show up to rescue me.\n\nHowever, that meant that I still had one more encounter to go before this became a pattern.  I thought of his unnatural strength.  How he grabbed me by the throat.  How he tore a student in two.\n\n“I don’t think I’ll survive an encounter with him,” I said quietly.\n\n“So make sure someone intervenes, then,” she snapped.  “It can even be another human.  He won’t dare leave a witness behind and he certainly can’t get away with killing two people for no reason.”\n\nI stared at my feet.  I’d promised I wouldn’t get anyone involved in this.  I wasn’t going to make my friends targets for the flickering man.\n\n“You do have friends, right?” she demanded.\n\n“Of course I do!  I just don’t want to ask them to do something this dangerous.”\n\n“Then don’t tell them in advance.  Why do I have to think of everything?” she complained.  “You’re human.  You can actually lie.  Make use of that.”\n\nThen she stormed off into the hallway and when I poked my head out after her, she was nowhere in sight.\n\nGrayson was the obvious choice.  He presumably has some kind of protection as the son of the university’s president.  As a bonus, if I told him what was happening and asked him to help, he might let slip some information that’d give me a clue as to how much he knows or doesn’t know.  I’m pretty sure if I’d asked all of you about this, you’d have come to the same conclusion, right?  \n\nI couldn’t do it.  I had all my justifications lined up and ready to go, but I couldn’t bring myself to message him.  I kept thinking - what if the flickering man remembers Grayson?  What if he goes after him as well as me?  And I’m sure that sounds like it could be a good thing, pitting the inhuman we all hate against the son of the university’s president… but I’m just not that ruthless.  The laundry lady would do it.  She’d do it in a heartbeat and if she knew about my friendship, I’m sure she’d have been advocating for that all along.\n\nAnd that’s why I can’t.\n\nI’ve gotten myself into this on my own.  It wouldn’t be right to drag anyone else into it or take advantage of my friends.  This was my problem to deal with.\n\nInstead, I decided to go out into the rain right when classes are letting out.  There’s a handful of common class times and when they end, campus is swarmed with people.  The flickering man couldn’t really single anyone out for retaliation when the interruption was just a normal function of this being a university.\n\nIt took a couple of tries to draw him out.  It rains fairly often around here, but I was also making the most use out of a rainstorm and hitting multiple locations throughout the day.  On the second day of trying and the third attempt of that day, I finally, regrettably, succeeded.\n\nI was outside of the building that houses the thing in the hallways because it has a broad overhang in one corner.  I did exactly as the laundry lady told me.  Step out in the rain, just enough to get a little damp, then step back inside the overhang.  I stood in the middle of it so I had plenty of distance between me and the edges.  I’d see him coming and still have an escape route.\n\nAnd he did exactly as I expected.  Stepped out of the rain right at the corner of the overhang, so that he had equal distance between both of my possible escapes.  I’d been watching for him, but his approach was subtle enough that I hadn’t noticed, and I jumped at his abrupt appearance.  My heart hammered.  I let out an unsteady breath, trying to calm down.  It was fine.  I had a plan.  I just had to stick to the plan. \n\n“You think I didn’t notice your little strategy?” he smirked, hooking his thumbs into his jean pockets.  “Always making sure there’s a crowd?  That won’t work this time.  Because just before you got here, I pulled the fire alarm and since it was so close to the end of class the professors just let the students all leave a few minutes early.”\n\nI no longer had a plan.\n\nIf I made it out to the rain, I might stand a chance to escape.  Last time I’d encountered him, he said I was partially right about my theory that he had to jump between the raindrops and therefore couldn’t hurt me.  I’d been wrong about him not being able to leave the rain.  I might be wrong about him not being able to hurt me as well.  In fact, as he watched me panic with a smug smile on his face, I realized I probably *was* wrong about that.  There were such things as mostly harmless inhumans, but the flickering man didn’t seem like one.  At all.\n\nIt was my best option, though.  If I fled inside the building, he’d follow me.  At least out in the open I stood a better chance of running into another student and he’d be forced to abandon the chase.\n\nI picked a direction.  I dove towards it, throwing myself into a sprint, but he lunged to intercept.  I don’t think I’d have made it even if he weren’t inhuman.  He was positioned too strategically.  I was too slow.\n\nI slammed into him.  My head and shoulder hit him in the chest and he absorbed the blow, taking a single step backwards but not allowing himself to be knocked aside.  Then I felt his hands on my shoulders and he spun me around so that we were side by side, facing the rain just beyond the overhang.  It wasn’t a heavy rain, but it was steady, and puddles were forming on the sidewalks.\n\n“Are you *trying* to make me angry?” he asked.  “I didn’t think you’d push your luck after the last time we… *talked*… but then you went and killed one of us.  Granted, those creatures are mere beasts, but *still*.  It’s the principle of it all.”\n\nHis fingers tightened on my shoulder.  I winced.\n\n“Well?” he demanded scornfully.  “Answer my question.  A yes or no will suffice.”\n\nThe condescension cracked through my fear.  He could stalk me.  He could threaten me.  Hell, he might even kill me right here and now.  But I’d be damned if he talked down to me like this.\n\n“Yes,” I hissed.\n\n“Ahhh, there it is,” he sighed happily.  “Finally standing up for yourself.  Now you can die with some dignity.”\n\n“You’re not allowed to,” I said.\n\nHe considered it a moment, tapping his fingers on my shoulder.  I stood there, stiff and shaking, my skin crawling from the touch of his arm draped across my back.\n\n“Yes, there is that little problem,” he sighed.  “And your little devil friend is watching to make sure I don’t try it.  But I think I’ve found a solution.”\n\nI looked sideways at him.  He smiled down at me, his eyes glittering with malice.  Then he removed his hand from my shoulder and planted it on my back instead.  He shoved.  I stumbled forward a couple steps, out into the rain.  I began to shiver as it soaked into my clothing, stealing the warmth from my skin.\n\n“Run,” he said.  “I’ll give you a head start.  If you make it far enough… I’ll let you go.”\n\n“How far is enough?”\n\nHis smile didn’t change as he licked his upper lip in anticipation.\n\n“You’ll find out.  If I crush your windpipe with my bare hands, you’ll know you failed.”\n\n“This is bullshit,” I snapped.  “You can’t just make up arbitrary rules for me to break.”\n\n“*I’m not*,” he hissed.  “Now *RUN.*”\n\nI ran.  These creatures didn’t lie.  He *would* kill me if he caught up.  I saw him step forward, into the rain, and then my back was to him and I was running towards the center of campus.  I needed to get to where there were likely to be other students.  Strength in numbers.  If I couldn’t outrun him - and I didn’t think I could - then I needed something else to protect me.\n\nMy scheming with the laundry lady isn’t the only measure I’m taking to make this campus safer for me.  I’ve also been running at the gym.  Trying to build up my stamina.  It’s slow progress and I kind of hate it but it’s *something* and as I ran through the rain, I was glad I had at least a little conditioning to keep from getting winded so quickly.  The water splashing at my feet was quickly soaking my shoes and jeans, but I ignored it.  I had to keep going.\n\nThen I realized I’d ran straight into water that was now up to my ankles.\n\nA flat sheet of water stretched before me, covering the sidewalk and spilling out into the grass.  It didn’t look like a river, but that was how it started.  Maybe it wasn’t this time, maybe it was just a spot of ground lower than the surrounding terrain and the water was collecting here.  But maybe it was.  I had only seconds to decide.  \n\nI didn’t know if the water I was in was the river, but I *did* know the flickering man was coming for me.  One of those deaths was far more certain than the other.  I kept running, straight through the water, not daring to waste precious seconds by detouring around it.\n\nI’d made the wrong choice on all counts.  It *was* the river.  And my moment of hesitation was long enough for the flickering man to catch up.\n\nHe grabbed hold of my hair.  A sharp yank pulled me out of my run and I staggered and would have fallen, if not for the grip at the back of my head holding me up.  I couldn’t see him, but he was there, I caught glimpses of movement in the corner of my vision.\n\nAnd he’d grabbed me.  Not the fleeting, futile attempts like the last time I encountered him.  This time he could use his full strength.\n\nThe water was at my knees.  I saw it spreading before me, swallowing up the ground, and the surface began to ripple as a current strengthened around me.  I felt it tugging at my legs.  I didn’t pay it any attention, because it wouldn’t kill me fast enough.\n\nThe flickering man was going to get me first.\n\nHe *could* kill me out in the rain.  I don’t know what changed or how he did it, but suddenly he was *in front of me* and grabbing at my neck, then a current surged and my feet were pulled out from underneath me and I was falling backwards into the river.\n\nI saw the look of surprise on his face before the water closed over me.\n\nIt tumbled me about and I desperately kept my face turned upwards, tracking the diffuse light of the hidden sun.  I had to keep track of the surface.  I kicked, pulling myself upwards with broad strokes, and then my head burst through the water.  I sucked in air and looked frantically around, searching for something to anchor myself on.  There.  Just ahead.  A stone.  I swam with the current, angling at a diagonal to take me closer to the stone that was protruding from the river.  I hit it square on and wrapped my arms and legs around it, holding on for dear life.\n\nThe river receded just as quickly as it had come.  I found myself sitting on the damp ground, pressed up against a gravestone.\n\nThe river had dumped me inside the cemetery.\n\nOkay.  This was probably good.  Cemeteries can be places of refuge in some circumstances, after all.  I could just wait here for the rain to stop and then exit through the front gate.\n\nYou know.  The front gate that’s kept locked with a chain and padlock.\n\nMy brain decided instead of finding a solution, it would be much more helpful to concoct worst-case scenarios.  You know how it goes.  One moment you’re trespassing because an unnatural river whisked you away from certain death, the next you’re being expelled because you can’t find an excuse for being in the cemetery that anyone will believe and your whole future is ruined and no one will ever want to associate with you ever again because you’re such a failure.  When I found the end of that particular doom spiral I was a crying mess, though I’m not entirely certain it was solely because I was trapped in here and the school was going to expel me and then everything would be terrible forever.  It was probably also because I almost *died*.\n\nSomehow it’s much worse when the flickering man is involved.  The swimmers just wanted a meal.  But the flickering man… it’s deeply personal for some reason.  I feel like… he doesn’t just want to kill me.  He wants me to suffer.\n\nI’d rather not think about that any more right now.\n\nAnyway, crying in the graveyard.  I was on the verge of calling Grayson and asking for help when I realized that I wasn’t alone in here.  There was another person, not too far from where I sat next to the headstone.  His back was to me.  He looked pretty ordinary, dressed in khaki work pants and a rain jacket.  Probably worked for whoever manages the graveyard.  I slowly got up, a plan working its way through my head.  I’d go over there and admit I slipped in because the gate was open and I was curious, but I hadn’t disturbed anything and now I was locked in.\n\nThere’s some fringe benefits to being timid and weak.  Once the waterworks start, people want to help.  How could something so pathetic be doing anything wrong, after all?\n\nI was on my feet and about to take a step in his direction when someone hissed my name.  I whirled around.  \n\n“What are you doing!?”\n\nThe laundry lady.  She was on the other side of the fence, sticking her face between the iron bars.\n\n“You need to get out of there before it sees you!”\n\nI glanced back at the man.  He still had his back to me, but he was turning his head back and forth.  Searching.  He moved ponderously slow.\n\n“How!?” I hissed back.\n\n“Get over here and I’ll give you a boost.  You can climb over the top.”\n\nI eyed the fence.  It’s easily six feet and the only crossbar is at the top.  But if someone else boosted me up, then perhaps I could make it over.  The tops of the iron bars were blunt, thankfully, so I didn’t have to worry about falling on any pointy bits.  I hurried over to where the laundry lady was sticking her arms through and linking her hands together.  I put my foot on them, she tersely counted to three, and then she, uh, threw me.\n\nPro tip: when an inhuman says they’re going to give you a boost, what they mean is they’re going to use their inhuman strength to yeet your ass into the air.\n\nI cleared the top.  Easily.  And thankfully the laundry lady was on the other side waiting to grab me on the way down so I didn’t break an ankle on the landing.  I was pretty rattled though, so when she seized my arm and dragged me away from the cemetery I numbly followed.\n\n“Who was that?” I asked, once I’d recovered my wits.\n\n“I don’t know what you call them.  Groundskeeper?  Gravedigger?  They take care of the cemetery.”\n\n“What’s wrong with him?”\n\n“I don’t know.  They make me nervous though.”\n\nPlural.  Something that made an inhuman uneasy.\n\n“They’re… not human, are they?” I ventured.\n\n“Not at all.”\n\nI ran my hands through my hair.  This just kept getting better.  I had to focus on the biggest of my problems though.  The flickering man.  I told the laundry lady what had happened and she nodded approvingly.\n\n“So… what happens next?” I asked.  “Is the… administration…? going to intervene now?”\n\n“Patience, sweety,” she said.  “You have to walk before you make him crawl.”\n\n“That is not how that saying goes.”\n\n“Well I like my version better,” she sniffed.  “I think you’ve got their attention now.  Likely he’ll be warned to leave you alone.  But if you incite him to the point he loses control of himself - then they’ll be forced to stop him.  They don’t like being defied so blatantly.”\n\n“Before or after I’m dead?” I asked miserably.\n\nShe stopped walking and turned to face me.  She grabbed both of my hands and squeezed them between hers.\n\n“*Before,*” she hissed.  “They will rip you from his grasp and you’ll see their vengeance with your own eyes.  Won’t that make all of this worth it?”\n\nNo.  It wouldn’t.  That wasn’t something I wanted to see happen.  I wanted him gone, I wanted to be safe, but I didn’t want to see whatever retribution the administration could dole out in person.  I didn’t want to even think about it.  But I told the laundry lady that all sounded great and she released my hands and walked away, humming happily, as the rain petered out and finally stopped around us.

        "text": "I slipped out of my clothes I wore on the plane ride and put on my comfy stitch pajamas. I sluggishly drifted over to my bed and tucked myself under my covers. As I began to fall asleep, I heard something from the other side of my room. I thought it was my overactive imagination beginning to stir as I became drowsy. A shadow crept its way across the length of my window followed by a long screech that felt as though it shook the entire house along with me. I squeezed my eyes closed tight hoping it was just the summer winds shaking a tree branch, but I knew it was real. I knew something was out there. \n\n\nI woke up sometime later to a sudden creak from what sounded like the old hardwood floors. I felt something lurk closer to me. I flipped over in my bed to face the presence thinking it was my mom or dad coming to check on me. It was odd. A “human” stood in front of me but I knew it was not human. The built up scream pressed hard against the back of my eyes. I choked down the scream, maybe it wouldn’t know I was here if I was silent. Something about it was off. It’s eyes were too shallow, its face was sunken in. It’s skin was too pale, like they’d never gone outside. I could see its long legs, that were human like, but at the knee, it bent the tiniest bit the wrong way. I saw its mouth, it curled into a sinister grin that reminded me of the joker. It crept closer as I tried to shut my eyes. “It’s a dream!” I told myself. It inched closer. It’s mouth opened to utter words. I saw it’s curly tongue stretch along it’s mouth. \n\n\n“Hello” It oozed out of its mouth. The voice was the same. Inhuman and human at the same time. It was dark and rich but there was a tip of bloodlust and anger. It sounded like black sludge dripping from a crispy apple. I tried to scream but I was too scared. I clasped my hands over my mouth and shoved my head under my pillow. \n\n\nI waited what felt like years with my head buried between the bed and my pillow. I could see a tiny crack of light seeping into my room. I gained the confidence to peak out of my pillow. It was gone. I could not move from my spot for hours. Even when my parents came to make sure I was okay I could not speak. I am not sure what it was, or why this sudden memory rushed back to me in full vivid color, but I do know what I saw was something that was not human. I am terrified that it never really left and is watching me from afar. I can sense something watching me. It’s presence was there, but I never saw it. Just like that night but much, much worse…",

        "text": "   \n\nI was walking home from work, lost in thought, when I noticed a commotion on the sidewalk ahead of me. As I drew closer, I saw a group of people gathered around a crow that appeared to be injured.\n\nI couldn't just walk by and do nothing, so I stopped to see if I could help. The large, black bird was lying on its side, struggling to move. It had a broken wing and a deep gash on its leg.\n\nI knew I had to act fast. I called the local animal rescue and they told me to bring the crow to their facility as soon as possible. I gently picked up the crow and cradled it in my arms, trying my best to keep it calm and comfortable.\n\nBut as I held the crow, I began to feel a strange presence emanating from it. It was as if the bird was communicating with me, speaking to me in a way that I couldn't understand. I shook off the feeling and attributed it to my own anxiety.\n\nThe first part of the trip to the animal rescue was a blur. I was focused on getting the crow the help it needed, and I barely noticed the curious looks and whispered comments of the people we passed on the street. \n\nSoon, though, everyone began laughing at me—pointing and laughing derisively as I hurried by, like I was some sort of fool for rescuing a crow. A small kid stuck me in the knee with the pointed end of an ice cream cone. His double dip of chocolate fell to the sidewalk. \n\nThe crow, though grievously wounded, struggled against me. I sensed it was hungry and wanted a piece of the shattered cone. I pulled the bird closer to my chest. I could not allow the crow’s survival instinct to interfere with my attempt to save it, as contradictory as that may sound. \n\nWhen we arrived at the animal rescue, the crow was examined by a veterinarian and given the necessary medical treatment. As the days went on, the crow's injuries seemed to heal at an unnaturally fast rate. Its broken wing mended itself and the gash on its leg vanished.\n\nI visited the crow every day, bringing it food and spending time with it as it recovered. But each time I saw the crow, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It seemed to be watching me with an almost human-like intelligence, its unblinking eyes following my every move.\n\nAs the crow's wing healed and it became stronger, I knew it was time for it to return to the wild. But I was terrified to let it go. I had a feeling that the crow was not what it seemed, and that if I released it, it would come back for me.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that the crow was trying to tell me something, to warn me of some dark fate that awaited me. I knew that I had to face my fear and let the crow go, but as I watched it fly off into the sky, I couldn't help but feel that I was making a terrible mistake.\n\nAnd as the days went on, I couldn't overcome the sense I was being watched. Every time I turned around, I half-expected to see the crow waiting for me. Perched on a branch. A fence. Angling its glossy head to get a better look.\n\nI began having strange dreams, dreams in which the crow appeared, speaking to me in a language that I couldn't understand.\n\nI tried to ignore the dreams and focus on my work, but they only seemed to grow more intense. And then, one night, the crow appeared in my bedroom. I woke up to find it perched on the foot of my bed, its beady eyes fixed on me. I tried to move, but I was frozen with fear. The crow seemed to be trying to tell me something, its beak moving up and down as if it was trying to speak.\n\nI knew I had to get away from the crow, no matter what it took. I gathered all of my strength and managed to break free from the paralysis that had seized my body. \n\nWearing only thin cotton pajamas, I stumbled out of bed and made a run for the door, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the crow's wings flapping behind me as I raced down the hallway, my eyes fixed on the front door.\n\nI didn't dare look back, I just kept running. I burst through the door and out into the night, my bare feet pounding against the pavement as I ran for my life.\n\nI didn't stop until I had put several painful miles between me and the crow. The soles of my feet were cut and bleeding. I collapsed on the ground, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath.\n\nI knew I couldn't stay there, I had to keep moving. I forced myself to get up and keep running, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do.\n\nI knew I had to find help, but who could I turn to? Who would believe my story about the crow that had tried to kill me? My pajamas were sweat-soaked, the knees and elbows torn away to reveal a gritty latticework of cuts and abrasions. My hands were pockmarked with grit and blood. I was hardly the picture of a man whose word could be trusted. \n\nI kept running/limping, not knowing where I was going or what I would do when I got there. All I knew was that I had to get as far away from the crow as possible.\n\nAs the sun began to rise, I finally collapsed in a heap, my energy completely spent. I lay there, my body trembling, as I waited for the crow to find me and finish the job.\n\nBut it never came. The crow was gone, and I was left alone, wondering what had just happened and if I would ever be safe again. \n\nI needed time to think. To process what was happening. I was in the countryside now, on the shoulder of a gravel road, exposed to any farmer who drove by. I couldn’t allow myself to be discovered in such a pitiable state. \n\nI rolled into a drainage ditch, and, drawing on the last of my strength, crawled into the yard-high concrete pipe that connected the ditch to the other side of the road. Its dark, damp confines smelled of ancient manure and decades of discarded beers. A desiccated rodent of some sort, a bald tire and assorted fast food containers completed the scene.  \n\nI sobbed with relief. I was now where no one—crow or human—could easily find me. \n\nFeeling curiously at home, I lapped brackish water from a puddle at the bottom of the pipe. My eyes adjusted to the light. I spied the remnants of a weeks-old Big Mac. I ate it greedily, topping that off with a relish packet I chewed on and spit out.  Thirst quenched, belly full, I fell into an inexplicably sound sleep.\n\nI’ve been here for who knows how long now, each day spent waiting for the Styrofoam thunk of a tossed away fast food box or the squeal of fresh road kill. \n\nI then hop out of the pipe and consume what’s left, tearing at it with my teeth, my fingernails before the other scavengers can move in. \n\nCrow, human, or a little of both.",

        "author": "Odd-Statement5422",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103nwjk/polybius_confession/",
        "text": "I don't know how long this will stay up before it gets noticed by the wrong people, but I may as well post it. I think I have to. I've been intimidated long enough. I told myself it wasn't my fault. I tried to leave the guilt in the hands of my superiors. And yes, what they did was an affront to any God watching, and a disgrace to the country. But I was part of it. I cannot deny that anymore. I am referring of course to project Polybius.   \nThe first thing you should know, is that the legends have given us too much credit. The thing we developed was not a perfect product. It was a test. And a test that got off to a very rocky start. All of those seizures and suicides were not intentional sabotage. They were collateral damage. At the time, there was a theory that flashing lights could induce an obedient pliable state. We didn't know much about epilepsy at the time. We were just throwing different things at the wall and some of them killed people. The suicides...well...that's where it gets a bit more complicated.\n\nThe goal of Polybius was to test, and if possible, utilize, the capabilities of gaming as a means of control and influence on the civilian population. Specifically, the hope was that more intelligent people would spend more time playing, thus targeting those who could pose the most threat of organizing rebellion or dissent. This was, in part, the reasoning for including complex puzzles as a part of the game. These puzzles also corresponded to codes and patterns that the subject would unconsciously complete.You may be familiar with a brainwashing technique in which the subject is compelled to write a statement on paper until they believe it. In Polybius, the subject would \"write\" a statement without ever needing to be told what the statement was, rather seeing it as simply an answer to a puzzle. These puzzles became increasingly complex as the game went on and utilized research into the addictive effects of gambling to keep people playing. In essence, the more intelligent the subject, the more the game would prime that subject to be obedient, and loyal to the government, while, hopefully, retaining that subject's high IQ in all other areas. The goal was not to neutralize potential threats by killing them, but by recruiting them. Those who did not reach the higher levels could be ignored because they were unlikely to have the high intelligence to question authority, pose a threat, or be of value if recruited through the Polybius mind control method.  \n\n\nThe suicides came as a surprise. After much research, and the placement of some operatives acting as psychologists and psychiatrists in the patent's area, it was eventually concluded that some of the messages and codes were causing the subjects great distress as a result of cognitive dissonance with their own beliefs. Additionally, it was inducing paranoia. In other words, some people were beating the game not only in the sense that they could complete the challenges, but in that they had, to some degree recognized and rebelled against our attempts to control their behavior. This lead to intense paranoia, which happened to often be completely accurate. After all someone WAS trying to control them. It wasn't aliens (this was a common concern in the subjects) nor was it so specific as they made it out to be. But as the subjects recognized the extent of control we DID have over them, they became desperate and sought at least to control their own deaths. This was considered the true failure of Polybius. It wasn't subtle. The other deaths were considered less tragic. People who refused to leave the game until they were dehydrated and exhausted sometimes died. But these were typically not the brightest potential recruits. They were not the type of person to never make it beyond level 1. But those who reached levels 3 to 4 were considered recruitable but expendable and ultimately far less important than those who made it up to level 5 and onwards. It seemed that those who made it all the way up to level 5 began recognizing the engineered addiction and attempting to ween themselves off of the game. This was unsuccessful in  roughly 97% of cases, but it did slow the addiction enough that exhaustion and dehydration related deaths in that group were relatively low. Within acceptable limits according to the parameters we had been given. The majority killed themselves when they were unable to break the addiction. In other cases the subjects would become desperate, their paranoia would convince them that the project was a raging success and that we had full control of the population. We didn't. Erroneously seeing themselves as isolated in a world of brainwashed zombies, the subject would sometimes increasingly try to \"break\" the control on those around them. In one case, the subject even went so far as to break into an arcade after hours and destroy a Polybius cabinet with a crowbar. While the subject could not be immediately identified, the cabinet was replaced within a matter of hours. Upon seeing the game back in the arcade the next morning, one particular subject became extremely distressed, and did commit suicide before he could be assassinated. \n\nAs more and more of our \"high value\" subjects terminated, we were forced to remove the Polybius cabinets quickly before they arose further suspicions.  \n\n\nBy the end of the experiment, we had learned many things that were considered, while not the success we had been hoping for, at least fairly valuable. Ways of structuring games that we continue to implement to this day that could boost patriotism and even military recruitment. This was most effective on those who reached levels 1 through 5. However, the stronger control and intense reprogramming we had been hoping to achieve ultimately failed because those intelligent enough to be considered truly valuable were also intelligent enough to recognize this reprogramming and fight it, usually killing themselves in the process.  \n\n\nSome of the data we collected also helped to create addictive games that were less effective as overall control devices but which proved very profitable to corporate interests as well as data collection later on, as smart devices became more popular. If you've ever spent more than an hour playing a game on your phone, even though you didn't like it and had better things to do, chances are it utilized some of our findings. Sorry. If its any consolation, I've spent many hours playing the same addictive games. If its any more consolation, it's only a matter of time until I get what I deserve, now that I've talked. ",

        "text": "Okay so the more I’ve thought about this, the more freaked out I’ve gotten. For reference, I’m a young, pretty attractive college girl that lives alone. \n\nI was at home depot about a month ago and there was a group of two men and a woman also in the store. It was about 9 pm and there weren’t many people in the store, and they were getting ready to close. As I was shopping, I heard a man walking behind me comment to someone that he liked my outfit. I ignored it because he wasn’t talking to me directly. He then repeated himself loudly and was like “that girl right there” which made it hard to ignore so I kinda laughed and said thank you over my shoulder and didn’t think much of it. \n\nAfter a few minutes of shopping I walked down an isle and they were there. When I went to walk past, one of the men stuck his hand out in front of me for me to shake, also blocking my path. He looked like a fairly normal, average redneck. He was with a woman that looked about the same vibe as him. But there was another man with them that looked homeless. He had a crazy look on his face, long tangled hair, and was COVERED in grease or dirt of some kind. He looked unhinged. \n\nThe redneck guy asked my name and then said “He loves Amys, why don’t you shake his hand Amy?” referring to the scary looking guy. (not my real name, but unfortunately I did tell this guy my real name). I reluctantly shook the other mans hand and he looked me up and down. His hand was black from whatever he was covered in and I obviously didn’t want to shake it but I didn’t want to be rude. \n\nThe redneck keeps asking me a lot of personal questions (where are you from, are you a student, etc.) and keeps looking at the dirty guy as if he’s like gauging his reactions to what i’m saying. After a minute or two, the redneck asks me where i’m going. My jaw kinda dropped and the woman smiled creepily and said “She’s probably going back to her apartment, right sweetie?” and I just nervously laughed. At this point I’m obviously very uncomfortable and so I say I have to go and walk away. \n\nI put down all the stuff I was carrying and immediately speed walked to the exit. As I was getting in my car, I see the woman leave the store from the other exit and stand by a sketchy looking SUV and pull out her phone and make a call while looking at me. I got out of there and made sure no one followed me. \n\nAt first I thought I was just being paranoid but no encounter has ever unsettled me like this one. It’s pretty common for people to strike up conversations with me while i’m out and about, but something about these people and the way they were looking at me made all the alarm bells in my head go off. Also, they never told me their names or anything about themselves, and they weren’t buying anything. I’m okay, but I’m never going to Home Depot alone at night again.",

        "text": "I'm an avid reader here at NoSleep. My favorite sub-genre is The Rules. You know the ones: person moves into a house or starts a job and finds a list of rules on the first day. Person doesn't follow the rules for whatever reason and stuff starts to go sideways. I always thought I was better and smarter than the protagonists. I'm good at following rules, right? I could remember to not leave my room after a certain time or to keep my eyes down when talking to the person in the brown pants or whatever.     \nI never really believed the stories here were real despite the admonishment at the top of the subreddit, so I hope you can imagine my surprise when I walked into my new apartment and found a frame hanging on the wall by the door which held a yellowed piece of parchment with a fancy, calligraphy heading which said *The Rules of the House.*   \nI have to be honest here and tell you that my first thought was: “This isn't a house, idiot.” Then, I thought: “No. No way. It can't be real!” as I walked over to take a closer look. At first, I though it must be one of those cheesy posters families put up with pop culture references or ways to treat each other but as I walked up to it I saw my mistake. It was a list of  The Rules. Here's what it said:  \n\n\n**Knock twice before walking through the bathroom door.** (“This is doable,” I thought.)   \n**Always wash the dishes immediately after cooking/eating.** (“Ugh. Okay, Mom.”)   \n**If you hear three knocks, don't open the door.** (“I hope they knock loud!”)   \n**If you feel like you're being watched, don't look for the Watcher.** (“Hmm. Shy guy.”)   \n**If you wake up in the night and hear breathing, cover your head with your blanket until morning.** (“Seems like the kids were right all along!)   \n\n\nAs you can see by my snarky first thoughts, I didn't think it was real at first. I knew had read enough, though, to take it seriously anyway. So, when I went into the bathroom to put things away, I knocked twice, then did the same on the way out. I washed the dishes when I finished dinner. I figured I would do the things just in case, you know? Well, I was glad I had been cautious when I felt that tingle at the back of my neck and I knew that someone was watching me. I remembered not to look at the Watcher so I kept my eyed glued on Twitter.   \nI knocked again when I went in to brush my teeth and I realized that this isn't the life I want to live. I know, I know, it had only been one day and the rules weren't all that bad. This is what I think the stories don't convey: it's a drag. Knocking twice before going into the bathroom **two times** had been enough for me. What if I am tired when I get home and don't want to wash the dishes? You know? It's my home and I should be able to do what I want in it.     \nSo, I stopped unpacking and texted the landlord to see if there was another open apartment in the complex. I got lucky and there was, so I begged the landlord to let me switch. He didn't seem surprised at all at my request which made me assume that he knew about the Rules and made me feel angry that he didn't warn me, but I got over that because I was so happy to switch places. Once the switch was made, I breathed a sigh of relief and got my new place all set up after I made sure there was no framed set of rules hanging up anywhere.     \nI lived happily in my new place for a solid week, no knocking, washing dishes when I wanted to, and sleeping soundly without being watched. You can imagine my surprise when I came home to find and envelope taped to my door and opened it to find a new set of Rules: \n\n**Leave the kitchen window open a quarter of an inch all the time.**   \n**Never look at the ceiling in the bathroom when the sun isn't out.**   \n**When you hear the sound of a bell tolling, spin around until the tolling stops.**   \n**Never leave dishes in the sink.**   \n**Always set an extra place at the table.**   \n**Knock before you go through any door.**   \n   \nI sat down hard on the floor, dropped the paper, and closed my eyes tightly, willing the paper to disappear and things to go back to normal. When I opened my eyes to verify that the paper did not, in fact, disappear, I took several deep breaths as I rushed to open the kitchen window and wash the dishes. I gave thanks that it was an efficiency apartment and there was no door between the living room and the kitchen. Then I walked to my bedroom, making sure to knock before entering, and collapsed onto my bed, weeping because I was going to have to move again. I didn't think the landlord was going to take kindly to me requesting another move, so I sat up and really thought about it.     \n“Well, these rules aren't quite as creepy as the other ones,” I thought to myself. “No Watcher or Breather. That's good. Maybe I can do this. I can leave the window open and set an extra place and do the dishes.” So, I decided to stay for a while and look for a new place eventually when I just couldn't take it anymore. Like I said: having to follow strange rules in your own home is a drag.   \nAfter a week, I had mostly gotten used to the rules. They weren't quite second nature, but I followed them because I didn't want to find out what would happen if I didn't. I knocked, I washed (actually, I mostly got take out and ate it in my car), I didn't look at the ceiling, I spun, and I kept a sweater in the kitchen because the wind gets cold. Under the drudgery of it, I started to feel cocky about it, started to feel a little bit of superiority, started to feel like I could comment on people's stories like “Pfft. I could do it. Don't be a wuss.”   \nThen, I found an index card on my desk at work:   \n    \n**At noon, hold your breath for fifteen seconds.**  \n**Tap your right knee any time someone sneezes.**   \n**End every email with two periods.**   \n**If you see a shadow in the corner of your office, beg its forgiveness for interrupting it.**   \n    \nI froze. I didn't know what was happening. I mean, I did know what was happening, but I couldn't believe it. Then I heard someone sneeze and tapped my right knee. I decided to take a few days off from work to figure this out. I sent an email to my boss asking for a few days of PTO, citing an unexpected illness in the family. I almost forgot to end the email with two periods. Thank God I remembered at the last second before I hit “send.”     \nMy boss is great, so she responded almost immediately that I should take as much time as I need. I packed up my things and forced myself to walk rather than run out to my car. I was feeling frantic now, I'd never read about anyone having two sets of Rules at one time and I certainly didn't trust myself to remember them all, all the time. I was thinking about how maybe I could just sleep in my car as I walked through the parking garage and I stopped dead in my tracks when my car came into sight with a white piece of paper tucked under the wiper blade on the driver's side of my car. For a single moment, I let myself believe that it could be a parking ticket or something then I took a deep breath and finished walking to the car.     \nI felt tears spring to my eyes and start to trail down my cheeks as I read the writing on this paper: \n\n**If you run a yellow light, kiss your index finger and touch it to the ceiling of the car.**   \n**Never turn the music up past volume level nine.**   \n**Never turn the same direction two times in a row.**   \n**If the radio tells you to take a turn, obey it.**   \n**Don't eat or drink in the car.**   \n**Don't imagine you can escape.**   \nIt took some doing, but I managed to get home following the Rules. The most difficult Rule to follow was not imagining escaping. The Rules were following me and it didn't seem like there was any safe place. I thought about going to my parents' house. I thought about selling my car and taking the bus forever. I thought about giving it all up and living in a box under a bridge. I thought about these things and dismissed them all because I couldn't really do any of them.   \nI sat in my car for a few minutes when I reached my apartment complex, taking some deep breaths to steady myself and work up my courage to face the Rules in my apartment. When I had gathered my courage, I walked up to my place and knocked on the door before going in and then I dropped my things and plopped down on the couch. I rubbed my eyes as I let my hair down and stretched. I was looking for the TV remote when I noticed a framed document hanging on my wall.     \n    \nIt was a yellowed piece of parchment.     \nThe heading at the top was written in calligraphy and said *The Rules of the House.*   \nThe first item said **Knock twice before walking through the bathroom door.**     \n  \nI buried my head in my hands and wept. There really was no escape.     \n\n\nAll of that was several hours ago. I'm writing this on my tablet under my blanket as I listen to heavy breathing from the other side of my bedroom. I can make it until sunrise, but I'm young and life looks pretty bleak under the weight of The Rules.",

        "text": "I don't sleep at night. Well, I sleep until about 3 am, then I wake up. For whatever reason, it makes me feel better to wake up to something. I live alone, which only bothers me from the hours of 3 am to 5 am. \n\nI started Stranger Things because I knew I wouldn't care if I missed it. You can't do that with things like Breaking Bad or It's Always Sunny, as you end up caring about what you missed. And I'm so sad right now I can't add extra things to be sad about, especially not dumb TV shows. \n\nStranger Things is great to fall asleep to, as it has few loud, boisterous moments (save for the end of each season). However, there are a few episodes that end with odd credits. And eventually, this odd credit sequence caused problems for me.\n\nMaybe I'm a total weirdo, but I wake up when sounds stop. I can listen to the loudest, wildest soundscapes while sleeping. Like my comfort movies are Saving Private Ryan and Mad Max: Fury Road. But when sound ceases to exist? I sit straight up in bed, dripping with sweat. \n\nThat's why choosing the thing you're going to sleep to is so important. You need consistent noise with limited volume spikes. If you're looking for a soft experience, true crime stuff is great, until they play a 911 phone call and a woman starts screaming. \n\nSo, one night, I wake up to Stranger Things. Season 3, Episode 8. Because suddenly, the cacophony of pre-teen voices and hip 80s soundtrack just gives out during the credits. And complete silence descends. \n\nInstead of just automatically playing the new season, this episode plays all the credits. I mean, all the credits. Like, I know the name of the second key grip's stepson. Once the English credits are complete, the credits re-play but in different languages. A lot of languages. I'm not very worldly, but it seems to cover all the big ones. \n\nWhen it happened, the sound of absolute silence roused me out of a deep sleep. Of course, I look at the TV. And instead of seeing a placid menu screen, I see blood red credits against a black background. They just keep going. Page after page. A veritable list of credits. Eventually I get tired of it and reach for the remote. I try to skip to the next episode. But it won't let me.  \n\nI navigate to the app menu. But nothing happens. \n\nI exit to the home page. But the screen is frozen. \n\nI turn off the TV from the main remote. The living room is plunged into darkness. The only sound is my heart beating in my ears. I realize how unaccustomed I am to total silence. I fill up my time with noise constantly, to drown out my thoughts. Now, in the middle of the night, when I least want it, it's dead silent. \n\nI turn on the TV again. The credit sequence is still there. I decide I will wait. \n\nIt wants me to finish the credits. \n\nI'll see what happens. \n\nText is replaced by symbols. Things I've never seeen. Things that make my temኛples throb. The space behind my eyes squirms. Text FLAⰳSHES AGAრINST MY VኛISION. I AM TRANSኛFIXED. I CANრNOT DENfY YලOU. I WILL DO YኛOUR BIDDING. I WILL BE YOUრR SLAVE. \n\nWho tf said that?\n\nSilence. Black screen. Darkness. The power goes out a lot here. \n\nI sit tensely in my living room. Dead silence. I notice the lights glowing outside. A neighbor's house is all lit uppp. Warmth and happiness exude from it. I look to the TV. It's my lifeline. \n\nThe credits end. A new season begins. I sigh, relieved. Tears spring to my eyes. It was all just a glitch. Everything is fine. \n\n\"Everything is alrighhht,\" I say to myself. Then I hear the growling. Long and low. I look over my shoulder. \n\n\nPeople don't know, but there's a secret Stranger Things episode. Season 4.0, episode ∞. A place where nothing hurts. Where teeth don't gnaw, and pain isn't everlasting. A place where everything isn't red all the time.",

        "text": "I exposed them for what they were. A rotting stinking pile of manuer that would stab the back of their smiling cultists for the control they tried to rebrand as freedom. Shoulda known that the wasps would come outta their nest and sting me for it. They didn't believe me at first. Then they didn't want to believe me. Now they don't believe anything. I should probably start from the beginning.\n It was a summer like any other. Green trees, blue skies, you get it. I was on my porch reading the paper when a band of hippies zipped by. The ringleader was carrying a radio. They stopped in front of my house.\n\"Oh no old man the radio waves are-\" The ringleader shook his body as if he was having a seizure and made a whirring noise. He laughed and slapped one of his minions a high five.\n I grabbed the baseball bat next to my rocking chair and waved it telling them to get off of my property and yelling obscenities. They flipped me off and got back on their bikes and rode off. I walked up to the radio and picked it up. I wound up and prepared for the pitch when I heard something. The first few words were unintelligible but what followed was english.\n\"Understood... Yes the Earth is ready for domination... Yes we are starting with Southeast America... They're brainwashed sir... No they don't suspect...\" The radio cut to static as a couple approached me. I darted out in front of them. I tried to explain but they wouldn't listen. No one would ever listen since I got out of that hellhole in Vietnam. Since I lost... That's not important. I need to get to the important part. \nI ran through the town trying to tell everyone about how the southeast was about to be overrun by reptilian insectoids from Mars but no one would listen. \nThey all snickered and stared and pointed and laughed and covered their childrens eyes as if I was the monster to be feared. Eventually, I took to the internet and got a few followers. People that saw. People that understood. We all banded together and swore to do whatever it took to stop the invasion. A few weeks into the campaign a man wearing a black suit walked up to me and told me to keep quiet. I refused to stay silent and when I blinked he was gone.\nThroughout the next passing week I had terrible nightmares. They were always about the insect people. They would kidnap me and probe me. I would be wide awake and feel my organs moving when they grabbed them with their tweezers or cut them with their pliers. They would laugh and eat them. I would try to scream but I couldn't. I would find myself suddenly standing outside my body watching in horror as they shoved the bloody bubbles and tubes down their throat enjoying every bite. I would always wake up in a sweat to see the man in black grinning at me only to wake up again and see the empty room.\nThe night terrors weren't the worst part either. When I would walk down the street to get groceries everyone would stare at me. They would stare and I would be able to see through them. Their muscles and blood covering a scaly demon. They would whisper things to me and I would ignore them. I had to ignore them. I couldn't have saved that kid I had to ignore them. \nAfter a week I decided I was sick of it and posted one last video. This one detailed what had happened over the course of the week and pointed I finally decided to mention the invasion on Southeast America. The video went almost went viral but it was taken down and I was arrested. I tried to ask the officer why but he just stared at me. I asked him where his shadow was but he just stared at me. I was in that cell so long I nearly starved to death. I stopped having nightmares though. After 5 weeks they decided I had been punished long enough and let me go. I blacked out and woke up in my room. \nI walked outside and looked up at the sky. It looked like it was going to rain. I saw the teenagers. This time they didnt stop to taunt me. The ringleader was crying and covering his face I could see horrible acne and rashes underneath his hands. I followed them back to his house to see if he was okay. He terrorized me but I was still worried. I waited a couple of minutes after they walked in to follow. I knocked on the door. Their mother answered. She was holding a broom and her face was red. She dropped the broom when she saw me.\nI began talking, \"Excuse me ma'am I was just wandering i-\"\n\"My son is gone and it's your fault\"\n\"Excuse me wh-\"\nShe slapped me.\n\"MY SON IS GONE AND IT IS YOUR FAULT.\"\nMy voice cracked as I spoke this time, \"I'm sorry ma'am I don't-\"\nShe slapped me again. and again. and again\n\"HE'S DEAD. YOU LET HIM DIE. YOU KILLED HIM. YOU LIED TO HIM. YOU ARE A FILTHY MURDER.\"\nShe slapped me again and again and again and I deserved it. I let him die. I ran because I was scared. I started to cry and her screaming turned into profanities and nonsensical grunts. After 3 minutes of beating me and yelling at me she kicked me and slammed the door. I stood up. I walked home. I was sludge. A cold numb nothingness coursed my veins. I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live. I didn't want to be happy but I didn't want to feel like this anymore. I went to bed. \nI woke up and walked outside. It was snowing in June. Everything was on fire and fireworks lit up the sky. Everyone was running around screaming. They were running from the swollen. They were zombies in some ways. They dragged themselves throughout \"life\" and consumed anyone that was close to them. They didn't look like zombies though. They had leathery yellow skin that grew over their teeth and nails. Their ears were pointed and dry Their eyes were sunken, almost absent. The worst part was the pimples and tumors. Blisters covered every inch of their skin. Some of them were nothing but tumors. I walked back inside and ran up the stairs. From time to time people banged on my door beggung me to let them in. I couldn't save them I had to ignore them. Sometimes I heard how desperate they were. I clenched my fist. I couldnt save them. I had to ignore them. I've been waiting 30 years for the monsters to go away. Don't think you see or hear something. It's not there. The monsters are just trying to get back in. You have to shut them out. Ignore them. You couldn't save them. It isn't your fault. I hear something. It's a loudspeaker. It's saying \"Behold you filthy mortal scum. A chance to leave this earth and go to hell. A mercenary that you cannot begin to even comprehend. HE IS THE ANTICHRIST. HE IS YOUR RIGHTEOUS DOWNFALL. HE IS.... KILLINATOR 90 MILLION\". I see him walking around on the street. He's killing everyone. I don't know if he can hear me or not. Please. I don't want to die again. Please send someone to save me. Please don't let him kill me. I just want to wake up. I want to be better again. I want to wake up. I want to wake up..",

        "text": "my name is Jasper, I'm posting this here, mostly because I will be considered mad anywhere else\n\n I want to set the scene exactly like it was for me yesterday, so i will probably go into what may seem unnecessary detail. Anyway, I live in the suburbs of South Carolina, near the coast, and I am a student at a school with a late release, and I'm so scared.\n\nhave you ever been somewhere, and just feel like something's off? like maybe your street feels a bit too empty, you aren't sure why. well I felt that when i left my bus, but it soon passed. so I continued along my merry way up the street, just going through my routine thoughts, like what music I'd listen to when I get home, and as i got home I got a bit let down, because my dad got home already, and i don't like singing in front of other people, so a tad miffed i went into the garage, to see the door to the house was open. it shouldn't be open, it's winter and my dad is a freak about keeping the temperature right, so just feeling kinda weird i went inside, thinking i'd talk to him about it, oh boy. sorry if my recollection goes down from here, i don't remember much, it was, well, hard from here. i closed the door behind me, and in typical fashion, i shouted \"good morning!\" or something like that. there was no response. I found it odd. Then I smelled something foreign to the household, something weirdly metallic. I had a single thought, what is going on? and as i turned around my question was answered within seconds, i saw red liquid seeping in the carpet. oh god. I walked over, the wound was clean and fresh, he had no more head. i was horrified, and called the cops, they said that they would be there soon, and then immediately, being the dumbo i was immediately told my group chat, instead of, i don't know, telling anyone else who actually knew him. i think the reason i never contacted mom is i was scared, i don't know why, i just couldn't bring myself to tell her. anyway the cops arrived and inspected the body, they had no explanation other than possibly me, i found this because of my knack for unintentional eavesdropping. at this point i just wanted to put headphones on and find some way to sleep, even though it was like, 5 pm, but eventually mom came home, maybe 30 minutes later, i was sitting on the couch, watching the cops do their thing with the crime scene, she cried, my sister with her did too, i just sat there. How did I just sit there? Later me and Liz, my sister, talked. I told her generally what I've told all y'all so far. She said something about dad. I tried a joke. it fell flat. We hugged for what may have been the first and longest time in a while. After that I think I just went to my room and hid until the night crept in. i drew my feelings out, the only way i could deal with it.This morning I felt it again, the feeling hasn't gone away, none of my remaining family feels it, it may just be my paranoia, but I feel something out there. Or it may just I've read too many of these to feel like this.",
