        "text": "For transparency: Obviously, as a Marxist-Leninist, I consider these accusation total bullshit. From my perspective, the USSR was - quite clearly - the most democratic and progressive society of its time, so why would anyone in a leadership position there intentionally try and kill some random minority population? Stalin and Lenin were themselves members of minority populations. It's just desperate identity politics by reactionaries who are using Nazi propaganda to fuel their identitarian agenda. Literally no Marxist-Leninist on earth has ever supported genocide of any kind (except you consider landlords an ethnicity and believe kulaks deserve human rights, of course).\n\nI have now read through plenty of threads in this sub and seen plenty of people who clearly hate socialism and the USSR and Stalin make increasingly desperate analysis of Soviet actions that could potentially be interpreted as intentional, etc., people arguing the semantics of the term genocide, etc. \n\nHowever, nobody ever looked at the only thing that actually matters, i.e. the intention to destroy as a whole or in part some specific population: **Has there EVER been ANY kind of comment made by any kind of Soviet authority that would demonstrate that there was an intention of eradicating the Ukrainian population?**\n\nNazis committed genocide against \"Untermenschen\". The British, such as Winston \"The Aryan Stock is Bound to Triumph\" Churchill, clearly intentionally committed genocide against the Indians and other victims of British empire. They are on record stating that they hate their victims, that they dislike them \"breeding\" and they are subhumans who don't share equal rights or must be eradicated.\n\n**Has Soviet leadership EVER made any such statements about Ukrainians?**\n\nIt most definitely was used by Nazis for propaganda purposes, so the characterization of genocide claims can definitely be called Nazi propaganda without any debate possible about it. Additionally, it seems to be promoted nowadays exclusively by people with an anti-socialist or nationalist agenda, particularly Ukrainian fascists like Banderites and the international anti-Russian alliance. Nobody else seems to take accusations of genocide seriously.\n\nPersonally, while reading through threads, I'm glad to see that this subreddit has become less anti-socialist over time. Man, some of the threads about socialism and the USSR, particularly Stalin, from 9+ years ago sound like literal Nazi propaganda. Seems people have become more open to the idea that they have always been lied to about socialism and AES states over time.\n\nI find this topic particularly important because European governments are currently siding increasingly with fascists, particularly Banderites, to push the Double Genocide myth and acknowledging the Holodomor as a Genocide even though I see zero historical justification for this and even otherwise anti-soviet/anti-socialist academics seem to agree that at best this topic is disputed. In some countries, it's now illegal to \"deny\" the Holodomor being a genocide, which is clearly absurd. (By the way: Is there an international alliance by historians that work against the recognition of the Holodomor as a genocide?)",

        "text": "I ran into an article about him a few years ago, and since then I'm still convinced he's one of the most impressive figures I've ever heard of.\n\nMuch of the information about him isn't in much depth, and some of it is contradictory. And the overall story of the Richmond Trolley Boycott is contradictory depending on the source as well.\n\nI'm mainly looking for a general overview of his life, the National Endowment of the Humanities has a good one, so do a few other sources, but they all contradict each other, and it's beyond my abilities to verify which one is more accurate.\n\nSome say he was born into slavery and was educated by his mother as a slave, some say he was released from slavery as a child and when he was a teen he was employed like normal as a carriageboy by James Lyons (who was a massive slaver so it probably wasn't much different).  He also was reportedly a teacher, but I can't find out what he taught, who he taught, and where. \n\nI also cannot find a full list of the crimes and atrocities he reported on, every resource reports an entirely different list and having them all in one place would be cool I think. There are also other various things, like directly appealing to the governor to not have a 15 year old boy executed by the state.\n\nAlso, there are quotes he uses about self defense, but I can only find one line quotes and I would like to read the whole article he wrote, because I think these cherry picked quotes, while awesome, kind of overstate how violent he was as a person.\n\nAlso, the Richmond Trolley Boycott, which Mitchell organized and championed, has several different accounts. Virginia passed a law allowing private companies to segregate public transport based on race, and the conductors could designate which sections were black only and white only based on a whim. Some accounts have the black newspapers organizing a full boycott, and luring white riders to sit in the \"black only area\" and only white people got arrested. Some other accounts portray those white riders as people who were mad at the law too and were intentionally protesting it. That particular company went out of business, partially because of the boycott, and partially because of a strike by their employees, and I can't find any record about what that strike was about, but based on the timing I have to wonder if the employees were protesting this racist rule as well. Or maybe just how much it effected their pockets?\n\nI also can only find one scanned copy of one of his newspapers, but reportedly almost all of them are stored by the State of Virginia and the Library of Congress, because he mailed each copy to the governor's house and every white owned paper's editor's house. I live close enough to DC to actually visit the Library of Congress, but there has to be an easier way to get these scans in a digital format.\n\nI realize this is more of a research project than a simple question, but I think this guy's story is cool enough that I'd like to promote it more, and be accurate while doing so.  \n\nThanks in advance.",

What was the level of interest? Was history mostly passed through oral tradition or inferred/reconstructed as one could do looking at Egyptian pyramids and drawings?How accurate were they? Are we even sure Homer spoke about Myceneans and Torah writers about Ancient Egyptians or were they just works of fiction meant to fit whatever was available (like pyramids) and then we later drew connections with ancient cultures? I’m assuming no proper scholarly work was done at the time but was there at least some evidence that we known that would definitely prove that Ancient Greeks or Jewish writers were indeed talking about older cultures and these are not just works of fiction?\n\nI realize this is a very broad question and different cultures might have different answers to this questions, so apologies ahead of time",

It started with the Federalists and Anti-federalists (or Democratic-Republicans), then the Whigs vs. the Democrats, and — since 1860 — the Democrats vs. the Republicans. \n\nThroughout our history, the two dominant parties have been broadly characterized by agricultural versus financial/industrial, conservative versus progressive, states’ rights versus federalism. \n\nMy question is, before the US, did any other republic or democracy in history have this arrangement? \n\nThe thought behind the question is this: I’m wondering whether the two party system is what has ultimately preserved the US for as long as it’s existed, and whether it’s more likely to help or hurt our continued survival as a nation. My reasoning is, I see a pattern: when one party collapses, the other party is always there to take power and at least provide stability and continued governance (even if their policies are meddling or terrible).\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your time!",

Mieroop is a historian, Kemp is an archeologist, and I found Kemp a particularly enriching supplement to Mieroop on Egypt. Does anyone know of a Kemp-like text on the Ancient Near East (Southwest Asia)? The evidentiary base is different and historians of that region naturally put a lot of emphasis on cuneiform evidence, but I would like something more materially based to give me a better feel for the period. I checked the Routledge textbook on the Ancient Near East (Kemp's is the Egyptian equivalent) but it did not have the same attention to archeological evidence, despite having two archeologist authors.

Are China during tang dynasty periods and after it so xenophobic that they don't want to go to \"barbarians\" land?. Or did they think the \"barbarians\" were so irredeemably evil to the point that Dharma can not reach them and that the Bodhisattvas has abandoned them?.

I've also been told that it's a gross oversimplification to state that NASA was the product of Von Braun. Which makes sense; science, especially in the modern era, is largely a collaborative effort rather than the romantic image of individuals making novel discoveries. Von Braun was brought into NASA years after it'd been started and from what I understand he was in an administrative role; a recognizable name with years of public speaking experience when he was self-promoting his own work who could make the science-heavy elements of NASA's work palatable for the viewing public. What he was not doing was actually directing the development of what would become the Saturn rocket program.",

Well , i started writing that story long time ago , i created the original caracters and order of events, but after some inspiration boosts i decided that the important caracters were going to have a historical/religious symbolism behind . It works that way : there are 3 families, the ones based on rulers ( such as Cleopatra , Constantino and Solomon ) , the ones based on “evil”/diabolical figures ( Belzebu, Set , Sekhmet ) and the angels/angelical beings (Saint Michel, Saint Gabriel) . Also , when two caracters have really strong bonds ( like being really important for eachothers arcs) , their simbolisms have to be related aswell ( like king Contantino and Saint Michel , knowing the visions constantino’s mother had about saint Michel) . Having that in mind , here comes my problem , before the all symbolic stuff, i created two male protagonists who had a really strong bond, briefly, the devil caracter hide the fact that he is a devil and at some moment the truth comes out , the other boy(angel family) saves the devil’s life and its reavalled that the devil isnt actually evil . Their caracters are extremally important for the story , but i cant find two religious figures that remotaly remember them , thats why I am asking for help . The devil doesnt actually need to be a religious being , one of my devil caracters is joanna D’ark , i used her as a “missunderstood” caracter , since she was killed by the church and proclamaded evil but afterwards proclamaded Saint . And the circunstancies don’t need to be that accurate , i can addapt that . Any religion works , it’s just important that one represent light and saving , while the other is a missunderstood evil being and they are somehow related.",
