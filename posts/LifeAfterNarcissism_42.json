        "text": "I feel so helpless. I'm over 1000 miles away from my sibling so I'm only able to offer distant support. \n\nWhat I'm hearing from sib sounds a lot like sib's spouse is having an emotional affair, but because there's been no physical contact, spouse doesn't think they're doing anything wrong. Sib's spouse is gaslighting sib pretty heavily (Sib *is* feeling neglected, but per sib-spouse, sib's feelings don't count because... No pink part involvement) and worse, my niblings are noticing that their other parent is disengaged and not available. \n\nSib and I have been through this, so very many times. Sure, our NF was an actual adulterer, but we know what this looks like -- just because pink bits haven't connected doesn't mean betrayal and neglect aren't happening. It doesn't mean that spouse isn't breaking the trust. We know how much damage it causes because we had to rebuild ourselves and each other. And we know how this ends if it doesn't get handled. But sib-spouse refuses to acknowledge that they're hurting my sib.\n\nAnd the worst part of this -- Sib's spouse is using sib's past to tell Sib that Sib is projecting, that Sib is crazy and controlling and that Sib is the problem. The same spouse who hasn't managed to buy a gift or plan a birthday party for their children (or my sib) in years... Is planning a party and getting gifts for the Other. Who hasn't read to their children or put them to bed or cuddled with them... Does all of that for the other's child. Is attending parent-teacher conferences with the Other for the Other's child. So many red flags. \n\nI think sib and I both know how this ends. Except when our mother left, our father gave no fucks, and there was so little child support enforcement then that mother just accepted that there would be no support and moved on. When our mother left, our parents had little in the way of assets, so that wasn't a real issue. But sib and spouse do have assets. They have a mortgage. And the court will never let my sib move with the children to me or our third sib because we're in different states, so sib is stuck. \n\nAnd I just want to protect my baby sib from this goddam bullshit. Sib-spouse is putting their personal pleasure above the needs of their children and spouse, is valuing their self over their relationship, their worldview over entry-level partnership empathy. It may not be hard Narc, but it's N-lite, all over again. ",

        "text": "For the last year, since my Nmom died, Doctors have been a HUGE issue for me. It's never been something that's come easy to me, but it's been extra hard this last year. \n\nI am one of those people that worries. I worry over every single thing. If I get a headache, I think to myself \"oh no, what if it's a brain aneurysm?\" Thankfully, I don't actually believe that I am in any danger. I don't run to the ER and demand a scan or anything. But I think about it quietly to myself. Sometimes I make a point to tell my husband, with the idea that if I pass out he can convey to people what my symptoms were before hand. I know it's not the best place to be, but I feel it's not the worst either.\n\nThe issue comes when something seems like it might actually be wrong. I have suspected for over a year, that I might have hypothyroidism. My Nmom had it, and it contributed to many of her health issues. But I've been really scared to call the doctor. I'm quite obese, and I have been as long as I can remember. I am always scared the doctor is going to shame me for my weight. I have had more than one doctor do this. I am also scared of the doctor shaming me because I haven't been to a doctor since my son was born 4 years ago. I know that I should have gone ages ago, but now I feel so much fear that I can't. \n\nWhat's even worse, is right now I'm really sick. Like, I had to go to the ER twice because of this flu bug. The first visit wasn't bad. My fever was 104, the nurse was kind and assured me I was right to come in. They gave me some meds, made sure I was stable, and urged me to come back if I felt worse at all. So a few days later, I felt worse and went back. This time it wasn't so good. The nurse spent like 20 seconds with me, then the doctor came in and basically said it was the flu and I needed to rest. I told him I knew it was the flu, and just wanted some kind of meds to help me not throw up and to help me sleep. He seemed annoyed, but gave me a couple meds and sent me out the door. I went to an urgent care 3 days later, because I was having an asthma attack from all this sickness. That doctor was pretty nice, and he gave me more meds, and said if I still wasn't better in a few days, I should probably been seen again. So, here I am, it's been 10 days since all this started, and I'm still feeling pretty bad. But I feel stuck. I'm scared to go to the ER or Urgent care and have them tell me it's just the flu and have them not do any tests. I'm scared to call my primary care (that was assigned to me by my insurance) and explain why I haven't been to see them ever, and I feel like I'm not getting better and that maybe something really bad is going on. I'm having some odd symptoms that make me worry I have something secondary to the flu going on, but I also am worried I'm just freaking myself out over nothing.\n\n\nMy family always made me feel like every medical thing that was wrong with me, was because I was fat. And that I shouldn't bother trying to be healthy until I lost the weight, because I would just be sick again because of it. I have always ignored most of my illness and pain because of this. I never seem to know if something is really wrong, or just a symptom of my weight. And I feel like there is no safe way for me to find out.",

I am all about pleasing and appeasing others and will try to remove myself from the spotlight while becoming the mirror that reflects light on Ns in the hope they will eventually see I care for them and will be nice and stop giving me a hard time.\n\nSince coming to this awareness about a month ago I started noticing my manners towards my fiance also changed sensibly: I started seriously apologising for silly things, being overcaring and somewhat easy to blame just my own self when something makes me even just uncomfortable: before him all my relationships had been clearly moulded along the Narcisistic pattern where the point clearly is annihilating one's personality existing only in function of the Ns possible needs or desires, either out out (stupid, blind) love or even just for practical reasons when the N relationship cannot be escaped, so at least in the hope that, if complying and doing all that's possible to show them care and attention, they will at least go easier on me.\n\n\nMy fiance has actually shown and proven time and time again that, even at my bitchiest self-defensive, which was for most of our relationship since at that point all I new was emotional and physical abuse and I reacted too much the opposite way possibly, he could care and support me, so I don't doubt his affection nor I feel like I don't have enough to try and please an appease him for more.\n\nHowever, the way I have turned apologetic in the last month is making me feel partially as breathless as i was when constrained to those behaviours (constantly walking on eggshells) by the Ns I had to deal with.\n\nAny advice on how to balane how things? how to regulate my established personality with the way that apprently comes natural to me to get and maintain affection, by trying to be as invisible as possible whilst trying to solve as many of the issues people around me have as possible, hoping that will calm them down and appese them to me?",

They miss each other more than anyone else. I reckon they'll focus on having holidays with each other more than anyone else for a while\".

I didn't tell my parents until I was 6 months pregnant, because they're already not a fan of Husband and you know, they're Ns and we all know what that comes with.

        "text": "...had it not been for all of that childhood trauma. 18 years of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse has really, really left its mark. And the mark is permanent.  I've been reading alot about how childhood trauma affects childhood development, adolescent development, and adult development. And about how much it affects the brain itself.  There are so many neurological differences in the brain of someone who has suffered prolonged childhood trauma. Memory, empathy, hyper-vigilance, lower IQ, mistrust, memory problems, dissociation issues, lack of ability to focus and be present, social skills, relationship skills, communicational abilities, intelligence, self-esteem, determination, motivation, ability to work through difficulty, resiliency, learning, emotional regulation, well-being, ability to enjoy things or relax.....just everything, is so badly and negatively affected by prolonged childhood trauma.  The brain is affected down to a cellular level.  \n\nAnd I was thinking today about what I could have been if not for all of that childhood trauma. My siblings, who got it less badly than me (life was no picnic for them either, but they did not receive the brunt of my parents' violence or vitriol as I did) are, respectively, a rocket scientist and an economics ph.d.  \n\nI'm smart enough and competent enough, but this just makes people dismiss my sadness. They say \"Oh, whyoh, you are so bright though! You are so friendly! You are so bla bla bla.\"  Well, ok, that may be true, but *I could have been so much more.* And I know I'm not dead yet, and so I still could be so much more, but no matter what I do, no matter what I achieve, no matter what I become, I will *never be as good as I could have been.*  \n\nTheir is no way that after 18 years of trauma, that I will come out of this near as well as if those 18 years of trauma had not happened.  My parents are out of my life now, thank god, but the damage is done. I'm 33 years old, and nowhere really in my life.  And yes, I've accomplished some stuff, and done some stuff in my life - but it's minuscule compared to what could have been. \n\nAnd no matter how I am able to clear the wreckage, or pick up from here, or construct something from all of this rubble, it's never going to be what it could have been.\n\nIt demotivates me.  Why bother doing anything, when doing anything just forces a comparison in my head between what I can accomplish given this state of affairs, to what I could have accomplished had I had parents that were not abusive?  Whenever I do anything now - pursue my hobbies, work, create, achieve - I just end up comparing what I've done to what I could have done if I'd had parents that did not traumatize me for 18 years.  This makes me want to refrain from doing anything - because at least that way, I don't compare what I am now, to what I could've been that I now cannot and will not be. ",

        "text": "TLDR: had a new realization in my healing. I bully myself and self-sabotage (in very subtle and sneaky ways). How can I change this behavior? \n\nHi folks,\nI don't have a meditation update today - I want to write about a few things that have come up for me, through meditation, recently.\n\nI've discovered that I bully myself. I kind of always knew this deep down, but I hadn't *really* understood this until just this week. In the past I thought of myself more in terms of being very driven, being very independent and self-sufficient - but that's not really true, it's more like bullying.\n\nIn what ways do I bully myself?  - Often not allowing myself to have nice things (even when I *can* perfectly well afford them); not allowing myself to ask others for help when I need it; giving myself unrealistic/impossible tasks and then berating myself when I 'fail'; giving myself unrealistic tasks so that I have to work long hours with little sleep and poor diet to achieve them; not celebrating or acknowledging my achievements and successes. \n\nI've been having some difficulties with my line manager - basically she's a bully.  I'm wondering, if on some unconscious level, I got paired up with this manager because I treat myself this way, and so the senior management team thought I'd be a good fit for her behavior - if you kind of see what I mean?  As in, because I never asked for anything at work, and I coped well with difficult situations, they thought I'd be the best-suited to work with the manager who has the more difficult personality?  But, in reality I'm the worst suited to working with her of course. \n\nSo, now, I'm working on not bulling myself. I don't do it all the time, so its proving difficult to notice and spot when I start doing it. Has anyone got experience with this? How did you tackle this problem? \n\nThe other thing that has come up for me this week is that I realized that I am self-sabotaging. I think I self-sabotage in kind of an unusual way... which is maybe why I didn't recognize it before...\n\nI need to give some context to explain this:  In my spare time around my 'day-job', I'm an artist. My last two projects were funded, the most recent was fully-funded so that all my collaborators got paid, and we also ran some workshops in schools. I'd love to quit my job and do this full-time - but it is a very tough industry and I'm not in a position where an insecure income is an option right now. One element of the fundraising was through an online crowdfunding platform - the crowdfunding was a success and we hit our target.. *and then some*.  Also, one of the other funding sources requires me to write up an evaluation report of the project.  I feel incredibly ashamed to say this, but I haven't yet completed all the 'rewards' for the people who contributed to the crowdfunder. I've done some, but not all - and it's about 5 months late now. I feel really, really, really bad about this - really, really, really ashamed. I also haven't completed the evaluation report for the other funding source - although I have an extension on that. I also feel really ashamed that I am late and had to ask for an extension. \n\nThere were some mitigating circumstances - the bullying from my line manager got really intense in recent months, and I was experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression and my CPTSD was going nuts because of it. Then, in February I got really sick - I got a viral infection in the space around my heart and I've been off work and pretty 'out of it' and totally exhausted since then - I'm just beginning to get better now. So, I didn't get the crowdfunder rewards and the evaluation report done of course, because I had a lot going on.  BUT, I still feel really bad about it, because I did manage to get some other things done in my life during that time. \n\nI think that a part of me has been sabotaging these two funding streams because I believe that I don't deserve to be an artist and do what I enjoy.  Deep down I believe that I don't deserve the money that was donated to our project (even though most of the funding went on overheads, space rental, and paying collaborators - I paid myself a small fee too, but I did the math and it worked out at $0.35 per hour I worked.) \n\nRight now, as my energy and health is slowly returning, a part of me really wants to get to work on this - completing the crowdfunder rewards and writing up the evaluation. But another part of me believes that I don't deserve anything I was given for the project and really, really doesn't want to do the work, and then another part of me believes that the people who funded the project are going to 'discover' how 'disgusting' I am, and that I don't deserve this and that I should be punished. (I know that is silly but that is how I feel. Thanks Nrents.)  So, right now, NOT doing the work that needs doing to finish the project feels much less painful than doing the work - because I feel SOOO undeserving of what was given to me, and I feel too ashamed to even start the work to finish the project. \n\nI don't know how to get started, and how to get over this?  I really want to get this work done - even though it is sooo late now, and I feel sooo bad about that. \n\nAlso, the producer on my project is amazing, and really well-respected in the industry. She is a great person for me to know, and could maybe help me get more work in this area - but I haven't replied to her last email (from 1.5 months ago) and I feel like maybe I'm sabotaging this working relationship too, because I feel like I don't deserve to work with/know this awesome person. I should just write back to her, but I cannot bring myself to do it. \n\nHas anyone experienced this kind of self-sabotaging?  What approaches worked for you to manage/overcome this? \n",

        "text": "The reason I'm in survival mode isn't *just* due to a childhood of abuse- but, well, it's part of the problem. I think I've been in survival mode almost my whole life, and I'm realizing that I don't know how to get out of it. There's always some reason that it's justified, there's always something wrong. You can always find bad things to focus on, if you want to. (and I think that I put myself in those positions more than I need to- either I don't advocate for myself/set boundaries to keep it from happening, or I subconsciously seek it out because it's my comfort zone)\n\nDoes anyone have advice on getting out of that mindset? On learning to let yourself take time to truly relax, to partake in hobbies just for the joy of them, to stop feeling like everything is constantly balanced on the edge of a knife and if you stop juggling it'll all fall apart?",

        "text": "I posted this question in RBN but realized this might actually be a more appropriate place: \n\nAnybody have any experience with excluding N's from big life events? Any tips on how to avoid an N showing up anyway or otherwise sabotaging said big event? (While we're at it, any stories of N's doing just that?)\n\nNMom has successfully ruined every big event in my life, including my high school graduation, my undergraduate graduation, my graduate school graduation and the birth of my daughter. How dare I, the black sheep, achieve something or celebrate something that doesn't highlight the failure I was supposed to be, right? I've been NC for 3 years. \n\nLong story short: Law School graduation is in a few months. My parents will not be invited. By not inviting them, I am accepting that no one else in my family will attend, out of fear of setting off NMom. I am completely content and excited with the prospect of having my amazing family of friends be the only people there.\nInforming NMom she's not invited is no sweat. She will inevitably attack my FOC 1-by-1, but they're used to her nonsense as well. Im not even that concerned with having to explain it to family members. The only thing I'm stressing about is the terror that NMom will drive 4 states to show up uninvited/unannounced... which I think we all know would come with a giant helping of making-a-scene. The info for the ceremony is online so I can't really keep it from her and it's on a grassy quad, so there's no \"keeping her out.\"\n\n",

        "text": "Before I explain, I will be finally starting therapy very soon - I was previously unable to.\n\nMy Nmom was very, very abusive and manipulative. I did not realize this until my boyfriend opened my eyes to it all and tried to help me get out. I finally did by getting a restraining order, but by then she'd snapped and tried to get a gun to kill me, my boyfriend, and herself, among countless other things.\n\nI don't want to go into too much detail for privacy, but the bf was extremely supportive, loving, and the relationship was 100% healthy. We were both happy and planned to get married. The real strain came after Nmom started getting more and more insane- bf met her in person in an attempt to talk, and came to the conclusion there was no way we could work out because of her and my twisted family. He was shocked someone could be as inhuman as her. (We are both from a strict culture and it's not as simple as you may think.)\n\nHe broke up with me, abruptly. I was totally devastated and this hurt more than NC with my family. I have never been in such a dark place as those couple months, and he couldn't seem to stick to his decision either, asking to meet but still acting cold. Eventually, I told him if there was no future to our relationship, there was no point in meeting and cut off contact. Shortly afterwards we got back together (initiated by him) and things seemed good. Even better than they'd been in years. Some things were not the same though and we still have not discussed a future, though there is progress.\n\nI am now so incredibly insecure I am constantly, 100% of the time thinking about him or the relationship even if I am concentrating on something else or at work. If he doesn't respond to a text for more than half a day, I am terrified he's about to drop a bomb on me again. If he seems withdrawn or tired, I am panicking. I am constantly preparing myself for a breakup. I can enjoy the time with him and sometimes it all seems perfect, but the anxiety is debilitating. So far, 100% of the time after the breakup, the anxiety/depression has turned out to be unfounded and nothing bad actually happened. I do not know how to control this and never experienced anything like this before. Is this a side effect of having Nparents or being abused?",

I do my mother's online food shopping for her.  I am LC, wanted to stop doing the shopping but it was part of a deal with my sister about care for our mother. I have managed to get down to doing it once every two weeks and have started regularly saying on the third week that she should do it herself. I'm trying to train her out of me doing the shopping gradually.  She systematically ignores my expressed preferences but is always trying to get a little comment in to guilt me. This week it was in relation to the third week. When I said I wouldn't be available to do the shopping then, she said oh but that's the week when your sister is coming to visit. I just said oh and goodbye and put the phone down. Then I didn't know what to do about the third week. Today I spoke to my sister and told her what happened and ended up saying I was just going to do the shopping for the third week (out of consideration for my sister...so there'll be something in to eat ...I often used to go to my mother's and it would drive me up the wall that she didn't even have milk in so I could make a cup of tea...I don't want my sister to turn up and there be nothing there). But now I feel irritated at my sister, that she's going to visit her and 'putting me' in this situation, though I know it's not her but me making the choice to do the shopping. I feel worried that my sister is taking over the role I withdrew from (this is compounded by the fact that I've decided to go to a celebration of my Dad's for a couple of days and my sister's going for a week). It feels like lack of support for me, though I don't think it is...it's maybe more like not seeing any other options for relationships and so wanting to keep the ones she has.  I'm very lonely myself and I don't want to damage my relationship with my sister but I find it really hard to try and disentangle the relationships from each other. What's the 'right' thing to do here to do the best for myself and my relationship with her? I don't know whether I should just not talk about either parent with her. Maybe that would be best. I don't know. I'm stuck :(.",

I simply cant erase everything that happened but everyone is pushing me to do so. Even my mom and sister (the \"golden child\") who sustained and witnessed a lot of abuse themselves is suggesting I \"try to fix things with him\". The problem is, he isn't trying to fix anything he is trying to forget it all. I truly believe he has forgotten all the damage he has done. He is still an alcoholic and has made no advances to be better for himself let alone my sister and I. I would love to completely drop him from my life, but for some reason the guilt keeps me stuck with our awkward strained communication.\n\n\n\nIs it okay for me to say no I don't want to see him anymore? Why do I feel obligated, like I owe him anything? And how do I stop feeling this way? The internal struggle is overwhelming.",

For most of my life, my nparents harped on me about my weight and always made me feel like shit for my eating habits (which I've come to realize is because I have a Sensory Processing Disorder) and my weight. It's taken me YEARS to be comfortable in my own skin, but I still carry this guilt around with me. I get really angry when people invite me to their Facebook \"clean eating\" challenges, weight loss parties, etc.. Its a major trigger that I really have not wanted to face (when I am usually head-on with my triggers).\n\nBut anyways, I digress. I was listening to this song and I realized that I AM taking care of myself. My fitness and focus is constantly on my emotional, mental, and spiritual self. I put in just as much effort (if not more) as my fitness friends do on their bodies and diets. Mine is just all the meta stuff. It was such a strong realization for me because I realized a lot of that guilt I had was for \"not taking care of myself\" physically and then it would spiral into how much I suck as a person/adult. So realizing that I AM taking care of myself in the way that is the most meaningful to me was a pretty rad realization.\n\nHad to share :)",

        "text": "So, lately I had realized that when I try to get my point across in various situations, I repeat myself over and over, just changing the phrasing. I knew this was counterproductive since I already explained my point, and I could tell the other people would get a bit annoyed of me saying the same thing over and over again. So, I began to wonder why I do this, and how I can stop it, since I want to be an effective communicator and respect the other person's time. \n\nWhen I wrote this down in my journal just now, it suddenly dawned on me that this probably stems from my Nfamily not listening to me growing up. The reason it dawned on me was that in the past few months, I had been having repeated flashback-esque dreams in which one of my family members would accuse me of something I didn't do or try to make me do something I didn't need or want to do. In the dream, I would try to explain to them over and over again that I didn't do the thing they accused me of, or I really didn't want to do the thing they were making me do. But, in the face of their blatant lies and them always being right, reason and logic couldn't win. Hopeless, I ended up crying or getting really angry to try to make them listen to me, which they either laughed at or used as ammo to prove my flawed nature as a \"bad child\" and show that my opinions were invalid. \n\nBecause I have been trying to consciously be aware of these dreams and write them in my journal, they were on my mind. So, I was able to connect the dots and realize that my over-explaining comes from years of trying to reason w/ my family (esp. Nmom), which never worked. I guess now my brain thinks that if I have an opinion that could in anyway be interpreted as wrong or invalid, I automatically go into defense mode, explaining it in every which way possible, under the belief that I won't be taken seriously, and in the hopes that one of the ways I explain it works and gets across.\n\nNow, I guess I just need to be aware and catch myself when I do this, and spend a bit of extra time formulating what I want to say in advance so that I only have to say it once. But it feels good at least to have been able to connect the dots and now move on to working on de-automatizing the unhealthy and unproductive learned response. \n\nTL;DR: Dots clicked as to why I over-explain (because of my Nfamily not validating my opinions); realization thanks to dreams and journaling. \n\nUpdate: Wow! This is the first time I've ever posted anything on Reddit, and it seems to have really resonated with and given insight to people. I wasn't sure at first whether to post this, but I'm glad I did. I also gained a lot of insight from your comments as well. So, thank you!",

I'll also add that, while I'm upset over something my husband did, he really is a wonderful man who goes above and beyond (which is why this feels so petty). \n\nSo tomorrow is Easter. Last week my husband said he would get me a chocolate bunny. I reminded him that I don't like crap chocolate (I blame my time spent living in Europe &amp; being pregnant) and pointed out a few I'd enjoy. Today he went to the store for some groceries. So I knew he got the bunny today. He tends to do this- wait until last minute. So of course, slim pickings. We started talking about it and I asked him what brand he got. He said Russell stover. RS is on my crap chocolate list and he knows it. He got me RS chocolates for Valentine's Day that were disgusting. I had one and gave them away. I very politely told him them not to get me RS again because I wouldn't eat it and I don't want to waste what little money we do have. He took it well. \n\nSo fast forward to today when he tells me he got a RS solid bunny and a giant hollow one (&amp; which ever one I don't choose our son can have) be \"that's all there was\". But I got super upset over this stupid bunny! I mean it's just chocolate but I think what gets me is the waiting until the last minute when he knows all the good choices are gone and feeling like he hasn't really put forth the effort. Then I feel bad about that bc he has been running on E for weeks now picking up my slack bc I'm so pregnant and dizzy &amp; I can't do anything unless I'm sitting. So he has been putting forth a lot of effort around the house.  Just not with the chocolate. (&amp; our sex life has gone down hill bc of my pregnancy/hormones/changing body and his exhaustion but it's left me feeling a little isolated/ignored). Maybe it's because I get weird about holidays thanks to my nparents. So idk if this is a flea, hormones or legit. I'm just really upset over this bunny. I just don't want to be like my nparents, you know? It's a stupid bunny that is meaningless in The grand scheme of things. But I'm still upset. Ugh. ",

Oh, and you secretly LOVE that I got my father's genetics because then you can tell me my stomach and ass are fat all the time!\n\nNs never change. I finally went VLC after my 30th birthday. Her actions show how self-absorbed she remains.\n\nI'm angry. But it's not like it will mean anything to tell her that. It doesn't serve me anything to be mean and caustic, tho I once believed it would, but that's just a flea. I want to text something back, though, and I'm considering this:\n\n\"I'm not angry. I forgive you for not being the parent I needed. I'm simply through with your behavior towards me.\"",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n \nI'm feeling a bit like I'm taking over LAN with my meditation journal! (Eeek, awkward.) So I've decided I'll feel more comfortable posting every 2 or 3 days.  But I'm definitely going to keep posting, because I'm enjoying the conversations this is sparking, and some posters have said they find it inspiring and helpful. \n\nDays 5 and 6: yoga each day followed by 35 and then 40 mins meditation respectively.  \n\nOn **Day 5** I started off feeling really peaceful, and then half way through my mind got really excited about planning and thinking about this idea for a business that I've had recently. Over and over again I let the planning thoughts go, and my mind kept returning to them. I gave up and let my mind plan the idea. So towards the end it was more of a planning session than a meditation session. haha. \n\nBut then, **Day 6**, was incredibly peaceful. I was almost confused, like 'why isn't my mind all over the place again today?' I guess it just wasn't that fussed - it didn't have much thinking to do today. It was weird, having very few thoughts in my head is a strange feeling - very nice - but weird when you are not used to it I guess.  I had a few moments of feeling really joyful during the meditation, which were lovely. \n\nTowards the end my thoughts turned to the problems I've been having with a bully at work. I noticed that the way this person has been treating me has been very similar to the ways that I've been treating myself: Unreasonable expectations, denying basic needs, ignoring me and then demanding too much - kind of like how I treat myself sometimes. That was painful to think about. \n\nLater, after the meditation, I noticed I feel a little different today. Ordinarily, I have the feeling of a deep wound that can never be filled, deep down inside me. It's always there, and I'm always trying to stop anything from getting near that emotional wound (I guess most ACoNs can relate to that feeling?) \n\nToday it doesn't feel so empty and raw. It kind of feels a bit more filled up with... well, I hate to say it (cause I'm sooo not a *hippy dippy* person) but I feel more filled up with love than I've ever felt before.  It doesn't feel like the wound is healing - more like the empty hole inside me isn't so empty today.  Also, I was thinking about my Nrents this afternoon, and I also noticed that in my thoughts they seemed smaller - they didn't tower over me in my thoughts, they seemed a bit smaller and less powerful. \n\nDid anyone else meditate, journal, work on personal goals the last couple of days? How is it going for you? \n  \n",

My parents and grandmother have not contacted me, and I think that is awesome. I think that the fact that this isn’t turning into a violent drama fest is the best thing I could have ever wished for. I have felt moments of paranoia where I thought they would show up at my door with guns, demand money from me, threatened suicide and the list goes on. I have had moments of guilt where I thought I just harmed three innocent people. It think it was all worth it when the sun came out this morning. I got a good night’s rest and I just felt normal and happy and healthy. I didn’t feel exuberant or excited. Just content with my life. \n\nI realized that I was clenching too tightly to my money and decided to go see Lorenna Mckennitt tomorrow with my boyfriend. I realized this clenching was merely a protection mechanism for my world to end after I went no contact with my parents. I’m financially solvent. I’m a responsible adult who pays her bills, takes care of her health, pays her taxes and might even vote this year. I’m whole. Nothing they did to me broke me inside permanently and fully. I get to find out what I love in life now, without their element in my life.\n\nI suppose I want to say thank you to this community and to the mods here. I have started to say thank you to all the folks who have got me along in the journey. My friends, my best friends, my uncle.\n\nI hope that those who are in need to escape get their chance and find the courage to follow through in healing themselves. Good luck everyone!

        "text": "This is my first post in the \"Life After\" branch. Never thought I would get here. So, hi! (explanation for *: not actually a stepmom; she's my dad's girlfriend, but has been for so long that they might as well be married. It's more of a term of giving into reality than of a valued relationship, if you catch my drift.)\n\nLast year, late November, I decided that I would just completely block her out. I would not respond to anything, block her in any media I could. I promised myself that I would block her on Facebook (really the only form of contact we had besides in person) on New Years.\n\nIn my life, my holidays were always taken by my dad and her. This is the first year I've been able to recharge and celebrate holidays the way I want to. So, the fact that I made even one of my own plans for New Years was a big deal. \n\nMy plan was to get together with some of my best friends, who actually love me, and drink sparkling ciders and play Dungeons and Dragons all night. It was amazing, and I actually held up to my word. It took a lot of willpower to pull the menu up, but as my friends were taking pictures of everything with their phones, I made the move and blocked her after the clock struck 12:00. I felt really powerful.\n\nI was scared of what would happen after that point, though. I didn't know if she'd invade my privacy, come to my house to find me, dig up my phone number that she has no way of knowing, etc. I was just paranoid that it wouldn't work. It seems to have, though. I've not had a single exchange with her since then. I blocked another account that looked like one I suspected she'd make to watch my activity on Facebook, and that was the worst of it. \n\nAs a result, my mental health is just improving on its own. I don't become crippled with panic when I think about having to see her. My intrusive thoughts are far less frequent and not nearly as intense. I don't feel like I'm taken over by my mind anymore. My sleep habits are improving, my body image is improving, and my relationship with my dad is starting to look like an actual relationship. We, like...talk. I've never had this before, even when she wasn't in the picture.\n\nWhat I want to do now is check in with myself on the first of every month and track my improvements and document any run-ins with her, if possible. I also kinda want to keep boasting about the time I've gone without talking to her. (It looks like people here call that NC, as in no contact--is that accurate?) \n\nFor my long term plans, I want to go a full year with NO contact before I might even consider coming back to fully reclaim my rightful place as daughter in my dad's life. I have also considered getting a restraining order once I'm strong enough, but I still am not sure of that yet. I am enjoying the NC life so far, but I don't want to block myself off from standing up to her for once in my life if I deem myself capable. So, that's not out of the scope of possibilities. \n\nThanks for reading and celebrating this with me. I don't want to disturb anyone I know (that knows about my situation) this late about it, but I needed to just put this out somewhere. I hope I can stay in the \"Life After\" phase. ",

My roommate runs a doggy daycare out of our house (Craigslist is wonderful) and he pays me to sit with the dogs in the afternoon when he's at work. I basically stay home and sit with sleeping dogs and get paid for it. It's a ridiculously sweet gig and makes me feel less useless even if it is only a few hours a day.\n\nOne of the dogs that comes every day is a little terrier mix named Ollie. Ollie is as tenacious as any terrier which should have been a sign because I fall in love with scrappy critters (human and otherwise) all the time. Ollie will go out of his way to flop on me all afternoon. I have extreme anxiety issues, depression, the whole list of mental health problems. On top of that I've been convinced forever that love is a lie and is a pointless manipulation. Ollie makes me feel so calm, and warm, and loved. I'm not sure I've ever felt this serene before? It's almost absurd how good I feel just because there's a creature on this planet I've truly connected with who isn't trying to manipulate me, or screw with me, or make me feel bad about myself. He's not even using me for pets. He couldn't care less whether I'm scratching his ears or not, he just likes me.\n\nA dog just taught me what love is. Which is sad and wonderful at the same time.",

I kinda want to get it framed and hang it up on the wall. Ndad should be receiving it today. The timing of this is sorta perfect: the last time I'd had proof of Ndad's contact attempts was the end of last year and I was increasingly anxious about how the months' lag time would affect the letter's perception. But asshole was dumb enough to leave another voicemail last Thursday, so the letter can appear to be a direct and immediate response to that. Even better, I can get a sense of its effectiveness by whether or not I am left another message this Sunday, since he has a penchant for holidays. If I don't get a message, the letter may be sufficient till his rapidly-approaching anticipated expiration date. If I do, I'll start filing reports with the FBI since it's an interstate crime. \n\nSo thank you, everyone who had words of support, an open ear, and offered to take steps on my behalf.

Not much to say today - I felt very peaceful again, and felt my body relax in places I didn't even know I had tension - so that was pretty awesome and felt amazing.  Yet again my mind wanted to do lots and lots of planning. It wanted to plan what to say to you guys, what to say to my counsellor next week, to my friend I have to call Monday, how to re-organize the furniture in the lounge, what to do if any of that goes wrong. Planning, planning, planning. Even, like, wanting to make back-up plans for what to do if any of those things go wrong - like planning all the moves in a chess game. \n\nI observed all these planning thoughts and wondered - why all the planning? And it seemed to be in case anything went 'wrong' - to protect myself from intense feelings of failure, terror and insecurity. Not really about anything actually going *very* wrong in *reality*, so much as  trying to avoid the *feelings* of terror associated with anything going a bit 'wrong'. \n\nSo I guess that was interesting. I wonder how much other people/non ACONs plan things in their heads?  SO doesn't seem to plan everything like I do all the time. It might be really nice to not be constantly planning in my head. Of course that would mean practising being 'okay' with the feelings of terror which come up when something goes a bit 'wrong'... Not sure how I'd be with that...  \n\nDid anyone else meditate today?

Sis has one 2 year old and is at 2nd trimester with a second child.  Our mother had been pestering her to go out and get warm clothes for the 2 year old. Sis told me she was frustrated because that would be a lot of work in her state; the 2 year old already has adequate warm clothes for when they do go out; and what with being a stay-at-home Mom and a 2 year old child, they can just stay inside and be warm there most of the time.  I told Sis that staying inside was a good idea, and advised her to make some personal space by replying to calls with text messages or email until such time as she was less stressed and wanted to talk to our mother.\n\nSee, though, here's a little more backstory.  Last year me and Sis and the then-1-year-old took an ill-advised neighborhood walk in cold weather.  Baby was content for quite a while, but then began crying and kicking of the blanket and showing signs of being too cold.  We made a double-time walk back to the house, with a baby that clearly should not be outside in that weather feeling stressed and shamed.  The baby recovered quickly at home, lesson was learned.\n\nHere's what I could have told Sis: \"Our Mom has been sitting on that bit of ammo for a year, and is loading up now that you're weakened prey, very pregnant and stuck at home and stressed.  She's putting you in a catch-22: either you go out in the cold and relive the stress and guilt of that day or you sit at home and worry your kid doesn't have enough warm clothes.  Either way she's leading you to feel like a bad mom with the cover of saying she's JUST TRYING TO HELP.  Oh, and hey, did she offer to send you some clothes? Ask if you could have your husband pick some up? Of course not, this is what we tube-dwellers refer to as 'concern trolling' and fuck that. She's not ever going to give this shit up.\"\n\nOn the one hand, I'm playing into our mother's games by not revealing my full thoughts on what's going on.  On the other hand, I feel that I can only say so much before scaring my sister off and leading her to wonder if I'm the paranoid crazy one and she should listen to Mother and so on blah blah blah (you all know the emotional abuse two-step I'm sure.)\n\nWhat advice do you guys have?

I also ran away but didn't get so far. So I was intrigued to hear this episode. What I didn't expect was the validation I felt while listening to the boy, now the man, describe how he had \"checked out\" of high school. I really loved that phrase, \"checked out,\" because I have spent a lot of years trying to diagnose myself with some mental illness to explain why I couldn't get it together. It can really be just \"I checked out mentally,\" not that I have xyz disorder or some such other insidious condition. I realized I had been harboring a lot of shame and embarrassment about my poor performance in middle school and high school, about running away, about having to repeat a grade, etc. \n\n\nI strongly recommend listening to this episode. I hope you get something good out of it too. \n",

I have recently been a witness to the unfolding of a scandal involving the animal shelter I have volunteered at for over a year.  The shelter veterinarian has numerous accusations of cruel and unprofessional behavior being leveled against him.  I did not witness any of this personally but during my time with the shelter I have been noting a gradual buildup of circumstantial evidence showing him to be a sadistic N.  \n\nIt is thanks to the education I have acquired on this forum that I have been willing to trust my own judgment since I started seeing this evidence and not constantly questioning myself.  Of course it was still stressful to see all this unfold, but it would have been basically a form of self-gaslighting (and therefore an extreme form of mental tension and stress) to be constantly defending him to myself, telling myself that I don’t know everything, there are alternate explanations, etc.  It’s a very sad situation and there’s not likely to be a happy ending, really; but in seeing things clearly and trusting my own judgment I have saved myself some suffering, and I have also been able to provide some clarity, perspective, and emotional support to a really good woman who unfortunately was much more deeply affected by this situation than I have been.  I am very grateful for that.  Thank you everyone, and please know that you are making a difference.  \n",

At 23, having been in sex work off and on since I was 11, I have **very** little experience with nonsexual or nonabusive physical contact. It really freaks me out! I was so astonished by such a gentle gesture I just kind of froze. And I can't stop thinking about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm glad they did it, honestly. It was very comforting and led to some conversation that I think brought us closer as friends which I like because I respect and admire them.

They don't know what their gesture meant to me and I'm so embarrassed by my lack of experience with human contact I don't want to tell them. But I'm still in awe. It's kind of sad I've never felt that before and I guess that's why I feel so bad but I'm trying to just appreciate it now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyone else have experience with that?",

        "text": "Hooray, I've stuck to this plan for 3 days. Yay me. \nDay 3: 20 mins \"yoga for when you're sick\", and then a long gap while I took a grocery delivery and tidied it all away and sorted the kitchen and then ate a snack, and then watched some youtube videos (ooops) ... and then did a 30 minute meditation. \n\nToday was a bit harder to 'settle into'. Maybe because I did the yoga which calmed me, but then I did a bunch of stuff which got my mind going all over the place?\n\nI noticed my mind doing A LOT of planning today. I had this neat idea this morning, for something I'd really like to do in my life which could possibly earn me money, and I got quite excited about it. So in the meditation my mind kept on trying to plan this all out in detail, and then worrying about all the ways it could go wrong or end up hurting me. So, yeah, I noticed LOTS of thoughts around planning and worrying today. (And of course, none of that's real - its just stuff my mind *created*.) \n\nAt around 20 mins (I guess!?) I had that same feeling of peace and safety wash over me. It's just a feeling of being grounded, rooted to the earth, and like everything is just fine as it is. So that was lovely. At the end of the 30 mins I had this feeling like 'but I only just got started, do I have to stop now?' But I was also quite glad to stop and have a wiggle and stretch out!\n\nWhen I first got sick with this illness 4 weeks ago, I was hating it.  But now, I'm actually feeling really thankful that I got so sick, and that I got sick with something that forced me to stop rushing around, doing, doing, doing all the time. I am *now* really enjoying this experience of self-care and self-nurturing. A few years or even months ago, I'd have been in hell emotionally, having to be so still and being almost housebound. But I am far enough along in my emotional healing as an ACON that I can handle this pretty well now, without falling into ruminating, going over painful memories over and over (something I used to do all the time) or feeling the need to keep busy busy busy to stop the painful memories and painful feelings.  \n\nFor the first-time in my life I get to *really* take care of myself, without feeling guilty. Plus, because the Nrents never supported me financially, I worked my way through School and College, and then went straight to work after College, so I've never ever had any real length of time to just be, to just really chill out. And of course when I was a child I was so busy managing the emotions of everyone around me that I had no time to just be me. This is the first time in my life ever, where I can just be me - and I'm feeling safe and pretty content, and not wrestling with depression, anxiety, and my CPTSD is barely troubling me at the moment. Of course I can't walk anywhere or do anything at all, but maybe that is good for me right now!?! \n\nHave any of you meditated today? How was it? ",

I went to the funeral with my sister, and we drove 6 hours each way with a 1 night stay (at a hotel).  We made the visitation and funeral, and it was very benign with the family and visitors.  The sisters/daughters were being totally passive aggressive with each other so I was just a blip.\n\nNMother was very low-key and was actually very cordial.  She did not press anything or make a scene.  I think she was really happy I was there, but we both knew it was me being nice.  My sister and I did not do anything outside of the scheduled events, so there was never any time alone with anyone.  Every conversation was at least 3-4 people, so no problems.  \n\nHowever, what I realized and got confirmation of (after discussing with my husband) is that my sister is an N.  When I picked her up for the trip on Sunday morning, she talked about an upset stomach when she woke up.  We drove for a little bit and then she threw up in a bag.  We pulled over and she made a huge deal about food poisoning, etc.  We made our way since she would \"feel horrible if we didn't go.\"  She threw up the Pepto Bismol about 20min later.  All of our time around family was about how she was sick, threw up in my car, etc.  We (sister and me) had to leave the visitation early so we could go to an Urgent Care so she could get checked out.  Nothing wrong, and she got anti-nausea pills.\n\nWe went back to the hotel and she was happy as could be texting in her pajamas in bed.  I went to bed at 8pm.  Then the next day at the funeral the entire discussion was about how we went to Urgent Care and she's feeling better, but she still won't eat.  Everyone was so sympathetic to her, and I'm like, 'this person just died and all you can say is that you're feeling better after this whole ordeal?'  I didn't care for my grandfather, but come on, how tacky is that?\n\ntl:dr - I'll continue to be NC with my mother and now I'm like wtf with my sister...\n",

        "text": "Explanation/backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4behyr/experiment_in_just_being/) \n\n**Meditation Day 1** (yesterday actually):\nI did 20 mins VERY very gentle yoga, and then 20 mins meditation. I felt much better afterwards, both in my body and emotionally more content. My body still has a lot of healing to do, and I'm taking everything really, really gently and slowly. A few thoughts came up and I observed them... like... I felt afraid that if I let go something really disgusting would come up. I had the thought 'I'm not good enough'. (A common theme for us ACONS right?) And then the counter thought 'good enough for what?' Then 'No, it's just that I'm not enough'. Followed by the counter thought 'Enough for what?' And then I noticed that was silly, and thought 'I am just the right amount'. Which was really quite comforting.  \n\nAfter the meditation, I looked at my 'To Do' list for the day, and ticked off 'meditate'. (Yes, even though I'm sick with a heart condition, I still feel *absolutely compelled* to write lists of tasks .. like 'call the Dr, do the washing up, make juice etc.') And I felt that the list wasn't long enough, I hadn't done enough stuff. And I wondered, 'when is the list long enough?' \n\n**Meditation Day 2**:\n(20 mins yoga and 25 mins meditation)\nBecause I'd committed to telling you guys about my practice, in this meditation my mind kept wanting to plan what I was going to tell you about the meditation! Like, what if I finish the meditation and I can't think of anything to say about it? What if nothing 'happens'? What if I get it 'wrong'? Then you guys on LAN would think I'd failed and I wasn't good enough, and I was being boring and self-indulgent just saying 'nothing happened'. As if this practice is only worthwhile if something entertaining comes out of it for me to write here. So a part of me could see how silly this idea was, but my mind still kept on wanting to plan what I would tell you guys. And then I was planning to tell you about how I spent the meditation planning what I was going to tell you. And then I was planning to tell you, that I was planning to tell you, that I was planning what to tell you. And then I started laughing at how silly that was, literally. \n\nI also had this image come up of me before I was born. And how strange it is that I was inside my NMom - this hateful, bitter, cruel woman - for all that time. How strange! But I also knew that back then, even though it wasn't okay, deep deep down I felt that *I* was going to be okay. It feels weird to talk about, but that was what came up for me. \n\nI also had a strong rush of simply feeling peaceful and loving - and just the awareness that my body really is so amazing. I know that's such a cliche' right?! But I just really knew it, not logically or rationally in my mind - I really felt it. I felt how amazing my body is, and that I have never really cared for it, or nurtured it, not really. I mean, I've taken it to the gym and fed it fruit and veg, and done relaxation exercises ... but I've also put it under lots of stress, and told it to work harder and harder, and beat up on it for not looking 'right', and regularly deprived it of sleep. Imagine how much better life might be if I were to really nurture and care for my body? \n\nJust fyi, I don't subscribe to the 'thought-stopping' kind of meditation. I am interested to observe what thoughts come up, and see what observing them from 'outside' does to the thoughts - without getting caught up in the thoughts. If you see what I mean. \n\nThat's all so far folks. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n    ",

She doesn't call often, maybe once or twice a month just to see if I'm alive. I roll my eyes through most of the conversation. Why? Because I let her do all the talking. \n\nShe starts out asking about my life. I don't want to give her any ammunition, so I don't tell her much. Hubby and I are still together (cus I know she hates that). Life is decent. No we have no extra money (cus the less she knows about our finances the better). We do the same routine, no changes. Yes, my health is maintaining. I know better than to tell her the good things in my life, because she would only try to take them away from me by criticizing anything that gives me any kind of enjoyment out of life. \n\nOnce she's run the gamut of intrusive questions and gotten no new information, she switches in to telling me all about her life and her friends and my aunts, uncles and cousins. She's giving me the family update, except....I have no interest in ANYTHING she is telling me. I have no closeness with any of my extended family anymore. I'm the black sheep, not because I'm a bad person or addicted to drugs or involved in crime. No, I'm the outcast because I'm introverted, rejected Christianity, decided not to have children, and because I'm socially awkward and suffer a number of mental issues due to the abuse I suffered as a kid that most of them don't even recognize happened. I wrote them all off a long time ago, and every time I think about going back, the universe reminds me that is a just a road to needless pain. \n\nBut she spends the next hour telling me all the updates about their lives anyway. I would like to point out to her that if I really gave a shit about these people, I wouldn't have deleted my Facebook account that kept me in touch with them. But she is compelled to tell me about all the goodness in her life, and then all the wonderful things her sisters do for their kids. Like, is she trying to get me to bring up some wonderful thing she did for me to compare her to them? I do the over the phone equivalent of smile and nod, \"yeah, uh huh, oh wow...oooh?  haha that's funny\" for an hour, and then I make up some excuse to leave. This time it was a need to empty the bladder. Of course, she informs me she has all these things she needs to do and of course she has to do what I need to do also, cus I'm not allowed to do anything disconnected from her. \n\nBefore I go, she needs to know what I did with some old thing she passed down to me like an heirloom. It was incomplete and basically junk to me, so I donated it to Good Will, but I told her I re-gifted it to someone in the family on my Dad's side. I assured her it was still in the family. Then she shrugs it off like I can do whatever I want with my stuff. She gave it to me and it was mine now, so no biggy. It's not until I get off the phone with her that I remember the statement in her question about how she bought that thing when she was 16. What does that matter? And it dawns on me, she was hoping it was still around cus if I don't want it, and it is, well then she might be able to get money for it cus it's antique. Really, Mom? You think I wouldn't figure it out? \n\nThe worst rub of it all is the very end of the call when I ...for what reason I don't effing know....say.. \"I love you.\" Her response? \"MMMMmmmm, bye.\"  WTF is \"MMMMmmm\"?!\n\n",

        "text": "Hi LAN \nAs some of you might have read - I'm pretty sick right now. Basically, a virus got into the space round my heart and caused inflammation. It's really painful, and I'm not allowed to do anything at all until it is better. Not that I could do anything if I wanted to anyway - I can barely walk 5 mins down the street right now. I've been sick for 4 weeks now, and I don't know how much longer I'll be sick for. \n\nI'm very much a 'doing' personality. Myers-Briggs personality types tests have me as an INFJ - we're real 'doing' personalities. Do, do, doing gives my life meaning. As well as this, being raised by Ns for whom nothing I did was ever enough has given me this mentality that I'm never good enough and I've never done enough work.  I generally see the only solution to any problem to be - do more, try harder, work longer hours, be harder on yourself. Sometimes to the point of really punishing myself.\n\nRight now I can't 'do' anything really at all. For the first few weeks I resented this and really fought it. And now I'm seeing it as an opportunity. An opportunity to practice just being, without having to do anything. I think the reason I got so sick was mainly because I was sooo stressed (I won't go into details, but given how stressed I've been, it's really not surprising my immune system went down.) And I'm sure that my constant need to be doing and achieving contributed to some of my stress.  \n\nSo, inspired by Kyle Cease's 100 days \"Self-connection experiment\" I've started meditating daily. (Thanks /u/saddetective87 for sharing a video of Kyle's on LAN) \nI can't do anything right now. But I can do, 'being', instead. Because I'm sick I'm just starting with 20 mins, and I'm going to add 5 mins each day, working upwards. My hope is that it will help me to feel more at peace with myself, and maybe be more nurturing and less cruel and demanding towards myself - and get more comfortable just 'being' me, without feeling like I'm not good enough if I'm not doing stuff and really busy. \n\nI was meditating regularly a little while ago, but I fell out of the habit. I think now is a really good time to commit to doing this for myself. \n\nIf no-one has any objections, I'm thinking I'll post a short update on LAN each day about it - I hope that's okay! I feel like it will be really good for me to have a focus to each day.  And if I've committed to posting here, then I've committed to meditating daily, so I think I'm more likely to do it, even when I don't feel like it, you know. \n\nOh and if anyone wants to join me and do your own daily meditation experiment please do and share your experience with me if you'd like to. And if any seasoned meditators have tips or advice for me, I'd love to hear it. (I'm using the calm.com app just for the nice background sounds :) )   \n",

I grew up thinking our difficult relationship was all my fault, I was an awful child, you know... typical N stuff. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was 8, and even while they were married my mother actively told me how horrible my father was to her but that he was my dad and blah blah blah. And I DO have some strange memories of him not being so nice, but I also have some really good memories of him. Anyway, I didn't hear from him much after that. We had weekend visits but they fizzled out and he stopped coming around. My mother of course had her own things to say about this (he's mean, bad, doesn't love you, ect.) So this is what I have grown up believing. Until recently.\n\nMy SIL ended up working with my father's step daughter. She tells a very different story. Apparently when I was 8 on Easter I got a card and threw a fit because it didn't have any money in it. I called my mom, she came and got me and I never saw him again. He couldn't bring himself to put my easter basket away for 3 years. I vaguely remember something like this, but it's very vague and I just can't remember what exactly happened. \n\nI have heard from a few people now (very small town) that he does ask about me. He asks about my kids... But I just don't know what the truth is. I was so little, and I am sure my memories have been poisoned by my mother.. But I just don't know how much. I have a family now and I am very hesitant to let someone toxic into my life, but my father is 67 years old and if I am going to try and have a relationship with him the time is now. I wrote him a letter about a year ago after I had my second baby and he never wrote me back... His step daughter, who was telling my SIL all of this, asked if she could have a picture of my kids to show him... She said that her kids love him and he is wonderful to them. This all happened awhile ago but I am just hearing it now.. I guess no one knew how to bring it up to me. My SIL no longer works there, but I was able to find his step daughter on Facebook. I don't know if I should friend request her, send her a message (what the hell do I even say?!) or just let sleeping dogs lie. I am so confused. I have no idea what the hell to do.... ",

Hooray for good friends helping to make happy memories to replace the bad.\n\nOver the mumps - wow was I angry about having more physical problems, I became massively hateful dealing with that on top of the disability situation - it's left some smoking ruins though, I have to repair a few bridges if possible :(\n\nBut finally now getting over the paperwork humps... I feel better able to move from the argh/avoidance position to the whatever/bounces-off position hooray. Still a long and painful move but moving inside of a week now, hooray for doctors and friends telling me to notice the signs of physical pain affecting my attitude and to back off the anger addiction until I can return to bouncing off the bureaucrats/haters/bullshit-in-general.\n\nGot a bit of military education stuff coming up now, and an invite to check out another group's annual session with an eye to teaching it next year. Normally I don't do military anymore, but my work's now unclassified which has generated interest... not sure how I feel about any of this so going in with shields up, but it's nice to be asked. So that's the next bit to work on, to stop with the \"expect people to be complete assholes then be pleasantly surprised when they're not.\". (Guess who had a hyperjudgemental gaslighty covert N? *raises hand*)\n\nRealizing the Veterans' Admin is essentially a giant N-system has helped me get perspective and ignore their drama. Heart's gone from 170 to 120 hurray :)\n\nIt's weird to find some balance and be working from that position instead of the zero-sum (won/lost) position. But a good weird.\n\nSo what's been good-weird or growing-pains stuff for you all? Hugs, Tartan.",

        "text": "I find this super triggering and I think I just need to vent. It's something that's going to happen in life but it really triggers and frustrates me.\n\nExample: a friend emailed asking how things are going. In my reply I mentioned that I've been incredibly busy with work and studying and I feel like I barely have time to breathe but it should calm down soon. In his next reply he said: it's much better to be busy than bored.\n\nWhat he meant: I prefer being busy to being bored and I'm assuming you are the same. \n\nWhat I wish he'd said: I like being busy but how about you?\n\nI wrote a slightly prickly reply saying no, actually, I find it stressful being busy, I treasure my downtime and I don't get bored - so I disagree with him on this. He's not a close friend and he's a bit annoying to be honest but this is something I generally find very hard: people assuming I feel like they do and not asking me.\n\nIt reminds me so much of being in my FOO and being told what to think and feel. Sometimes in a way that was out and out abusive and sometimes in a more subtly invalidating way, people would assume things about me and never check them out. Nobody ever asked me what I liked or how I felt.\n\nI can't avoid this as so many people do it; not really because they don't see me but because they have a need for others to be like them. A woman I know through some friends (I don't really like her but can't avoid ever seeing her) does this a lot. She'll interrupt me to tell me I'm like her.\n\nShe has interrupted me to tell me I'm like her because she doesn't check her emails every day (I do, though, I just said I missed one), and to say I'm like her because she doesn't like going places alone (actually I love doing things on my own and she was misunderstanding me).\n\nI know it's about them not me but some young and primal part of me worries that I'm just not quite registering properly as a person in the world or something.",

The recurring nightmares I have of waking up in their house after surgery are no longer a possible reality.\n\nMy lawyer was very friendly and very professional. He did not question my intentions. I was quoted a price that was consistent with what I read about online - it will now be considerably cheaper for me to write a living will. I haven't done that yet because I am in good health and don't have any property, children, assets, or investments. Still in grad school mode. If any of you were curious, it cost $400 and I was quoted an additional $400 for a living will. If you like in the Oklahoma City area, you can PM me for a recommendation. I would absolutely recommend my attorney.\n\nI will add that I am unmarried but that these documents are crucial for even married ACONs.\nI'm also happy to say that I'd like to be an organ donor. My Nparents told me they would never allow my organs to be donated, and now what they think doesn't matter.",

The only reason I contacted her again was because my father was hospitalized, and since they are separated, I had to let her know. \n\nThis lead to a huge conversation where I really opened up to her. I had tried to start a conversation like this before, but she was defensive and projected a lot onto me. That lead to restricting contact. This time, she was very receptive and she opened up to me about how she felt during certain periods of our lives as well. She seemed to really have her shit together and I really thought we could start the healing process, finally.\n\nNow, a year and a half later, I'm not so sure. My fiance had a conversation with her on Messenger a few days ago, and she brings up a lot of things about how I was as a teenager. About how I had mood swings (yes), how we fought a lot (correct), and how I accused her of things that she had never done (...???). She went on to tell my fiance that she had gone along with what I was saying after we got back in touch to keep me happy, because she didn't want to lose me.\n\nI confronted her about it today, and I did not hold back. I was so angry. I'm still angry. She refuses to acknowledge she did anything wrong, when our entire conversation in 2014 was her apologizing and finally taking responsibility for things she never had before. Now she's saying none of it even happened.\n\nI'm furious and I don't know what to do. The hardest part of NC is that I can't keep in touch with my brother, who is ten. Growing up I tried to talk to her friends about her behaviour and none of them believed me, so if he grows up in a similar environment that I did, I want to know that I can be there for him. But I really can't deal with her bullshit anymore.",

And how long has it been ? What is your life like now as opposed to how it was then ?\n\n\nLuckily for myself, I have not fallen victim to narcissistic abuse for too long, I had a 2 year relationship that felt very funny, it was very intense, the good times were great, and the bad times were ...well, just that.\nThe bad certainly heavily outweighed the good. And redefined even, the meaning of ''bad.''\nHmm... let's not dwell in the past ! \n It has been 6 months that I have gone no contact now, and I do feel happier and healthier. \n\nYet I cannot help but notice that this overall experience changed many aspects of my personality. \n\nFor instance, I appologize a lot for anything, even silly things.\nI keep asking if I am angering people. \n\nIt's a little strange these tics I've picked up, I have been told that it is a weird thing to do, and it makes people uncomfortable. Perhaps I am kind of damaged, it must be apparent to a trained eye but I am in a much better place in my life. I developed GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) towards the end of that toxic relationship, I still feel anxious at times, but far less, I currently still consume medication to counter act this developpement. \n\nI have not seeked professional help, or anything of the sort, I tend to not speak extensively about my experiences with the ex yet I do replay many things in my mind as I am piecing this jigsaw together and making sense of it in my New Post No-Contact Life. \n\nI am curious about your experiences, if you do not mind sharing some inside scoops of course !! \nI would be interested to read your responses. \n\nThank you for reading !! ♡ ♥ ♥ (Still healing haha !) \n\nTake care !  ♩  ♫ ",

        "text": "A Devil Dressed Like An Angel, Or An Angel In Disguise?\nHey,\n\nI met my latest princess when moving to a new city inorder to be close to my 10 year old daughter.\nI had a traumatic childhood and always had problem connecting with anyone. I met this \"princess\" online and she wanted to know a lot about me from the start. She was divorced since 1 1/2 years ago after a ten year marriage and two kids with an abusive husband. Later I found out it just been 4 months since he moved out from her appartment after trying to patch things up again. She had a clear understanding and experience of suffering and on our first date we didnt have akward pauses but held eachothers gaze for long period of times. I was sold. But she was the one pursuing me. We made passionately love for nights, our eyes sparkled everytime they met.\n\nI believe the hardest and most painful battle you ever experience is a battle for your own reality. When your perception of reality is challanged its almost impossible to let go, you go to hell and back to resolve it, to conquer the opposition. The denyer. My reality was denied over and over from an early age by my mum. My mother denied what she had said, what she had done, my own experiences and even my own individuality. She did this without any regard or empathy. \"Maybe you dreamt it\"...\n\nThe last three years before moving to this city, I had lived secluded in a beautiful forest dedicating my time mostly to Buddhist practice and meditation. For the first time in my life I gained some inner freedom, wellbeing and peace. For the first time I felt I was living where I should be living and doing exactly what I should be doing. But after a 3 month long retreat in a Buddhist monastary in India I started to realise that I had to backtrack my behavioural pattern inorder to resolve and dissolve instead of escaping. In Buddhist philosophy its believed that a pain unresolved or not endured to exhaustion will circle back over and over until done so. I really belive this, as this pattern of my fight for my reality and inner truth comes back over and over again. Im still fighting the same fight starting with my mother, only the opponent seems to gain a weight class every time. I think mainly because the essence of the real conflict is getting clearer and clearer. Seeing it from this perspective also makes my opponent my greatest teacher, all the time growing in front of me as to the point it is clouding my whole vision, thus making it impossible to ignore. I stopped trying to make a run from truth, Im staying my ground wherever it will take me. Im seeking out this kind of people as much as they do me and at the end I will be the one who have benefitted the most and they deserve both my gratitude and compassion.\n\nI have heard but never understood the meaning of terms such as \"narcissism\", \"co-dependancy\" or \"empath\" I think getting stuck in labels can be crippleing and stop you from progression because it helps define a kind of permenance, wich for me is impossible. But knowing this I also think it helps looking at things with different lenses and sometimes you need to have focus on what and who you are in this very instant. And learning about this terms and other peoples experiences has helped me understand a lot and Im very grateful!\n\nAs time passed my \"princess\" showed other sides. She could after a loving night sit opposite me, staring into my eyes with a dark look in hers and the room would start to feel very cold. At first I asked what was wrong but she would be moody and never really answer. I felt unwanted and unwelcomed and would trie to leave but that always triggerd a rage or/and crying that made it hard for me to leave. Sometimes she tried to stop me physically.\n\nShe was higly illogical. She proclaimed her own high standard of morals but they never seemed to apply to herself.\n\nShe started criticize how I dressed, where I lived, my financial situation, my hair or beard and it wasnt just that she critisized (many women seems to want to improve something in their men) but it was something alarming with the contempt she was doing it with. This contempt or \"malice\" if you will also showed it self if I spoke good about my self, even if I proclaimed jokingley that I would make her \"the worlds best omelette\" for breakfest. I like to cook and especially for someone I care for. She would tell me straight away that I wasnt perfect nor did I make anything close to the worlds best omelette. The malice in her voice and blackness in her eyes when she \"turned\" this situation always sent cold shivers down my spine.\n\nI started looking for a house close to my daughters Mother and my daughters school. \"Princess\" wondered why I didnt look for a house close to hers on the other side of town. This was in a period when she started to doubt if I was the one and went from hot to cold in 1.2 sec. Having 2 kids herself that she cared a lot for I couldnt believe she was serious and when I smilingely said \"what about my daughter then?\" she would answer with no smile \"what about me?\" and I would experience yet another cold shiver.\n\nWe started fighting alot. Growing up fighting both my mum, her alcoholic husband and (as my abscent father was from another ethnicity) a lot of other kids and people in rural Sweden, I thought I had enough aggression to match hers but the fights started to seem more and more pointless and never led anywhere. I talked and talked instead but when I thought we were getting somewhere one day, she seemed to have forgotten all about it the next.\n\nWe broke up and came together after a couple of months. She said that this time I better marry her, but after a couple of days it seemed she had been in a relationship with another man and though she finally broke up with him, seemingly anyway, she twisted the facts and truths about the details when I pointed out I that I would never had came back if I knew. \n\nHer kids is my strongest point of reference in order to somehow validate the relationship as real. Im the only one they been introduced to and this is her strongest point whenever I question her intentions. I both like them and started to care for them.\n\nBut after every break up or me pulling back because I think we are about to break up I start to see the pattern clearer and clearer. The first weeks are great and seemingly better and better, then suddenly when I feel we are at our best she somehow pulls the carpet from under me. For instance, one evening I cook us a romantic dinner wich is followed by a night of passionate lovemaking. I had been working 6 days in a row until the day after. In the morning I cook her, me and my daughter a big breakfest. She is about to get of to her salong (part time beauty salong) to work for a couple hours. My daughter has gone of to her saturday handball match and later that evening we have made plans for us both to come over and help \"princess\" paint her new appartment, the new appartment we by the way spent a day helping her move into. Me and the love of my life is left on the couch snuggeling after a night I can still feel the euphoria of, Im happy! I say this out loud as I go on about me looking forward to the days off and the fotball game on TV Im finally able to see live later! Then something turns dark in her eyes and she starts to talk to me with despise. Now I start thinking of the episode I dissmissed earlier in bed as she tried to headbutt my nose when I moved into put my arms around her. Was that for real? I ask her whats wrong and she says that Im really rude because Im not offering to go to her appatment and start painting while shes at work. Im hearing what she says but my mind races to find som logical explenation for the words coming out of her mouth. I get confused and hurt looking at her with disbelief, this actually makes her look a little smug as she goes onto explain why I should just know these things. I dont want to cuddle while feeling abused so I stand up like Im on fire, that makes her furious so she starts yelling at me and runs for the door and get dressed. I dont want to fight, I just feel devestated and are left looking out the window. She calms down a little and asks me to kiss her god bye, not a bone in my body wants to kiss her now but I know it will be an issue if I dont. I get over to kiss her good bye but this also makes her mad as she can clearly se I dont want to. She runs out slamming the door! Then I dont hear anything for a couple of days leaving me wonder what happend. She never appologises for anything, never really takes responsibility for anything and whenever I confront her with, what I think  is, a hurtfull behaviour she ends up screaming at me however tenderley I go about it.\n\nI start to see this pattern. Other patterns that become more end more evident is with her constant being on the phone and half lies about other men as soon we been apart. Her lack of consistancy of anything she says and does, in addition I noticed that she is warmer and more loving when shes texting me than she will ever be face to face. But Im doubting it. Its like youre innocent until proving guilty and theres always a slight doubt of a crime before full confession no matter the evidence. When I try to logically talk with her about casue and effect Im \"analyzing\" or being a \"philosopher\" or self proclaimed \"professor\". She also calls me \"kind poor little me\" or \"sensitive\". Its hard to understand that someone that you spend 95 % of your time together listening to their cries, anxeitys and fears belitteling your problems and pretending like hers never happend. This is where my fight for reality really kicks in and gets me frustrated to the brink of madness. The calmer they are when I get into a frustrated look for truth and recognition the more frustrated I get, and round and round it goes. My mum mastered this to perfection together with evading straight questions, I could spend 2-3 hours crying, feeling I go mad trying to pin point her to answer one straight question and the more wild I got the more calm and smug she became. This is how you drive someone insane! Both my mum and \"princess\" likes to offer me proffesional help at this stage.\n\nAs I said, the cyclic pattern of our relationship moves faster and the ups get higher and the lows lower, but she also get more agressive with her rages. Our last bout was about a month ago when I planned to take her to a winetasting through my job and at the same time to meet an old female aquintance somelier of mine I havent seen for a long time. We had been together for about two weeks this time and everything been better and more promising then ever. Three hours before we go she starts saying she might run late and I say well it starts at 9... This response seems to be wrong because I can sense something is wrong. Some times goes and she brings it up again I say we cant change the time it starts but to ensure we are counted for I can go before and she can meet up when shes done? She gets into a rage right away and tells me if thast the case I can go alone, this she does infront of here brother and kids. I feel stupid. When were alone Im asking whats up with her? Shes still mad as hell and I say it doesnt even matter for me if we dont go at all. We can stay home? Nothing is right now, and how could I say something like that, should she come trailing after me? I try to calm her down and putting my palms together asks her whats really the problem, please? She starts mocking what I say and how I hold my hands. I been here before and as I see my love disapear and this woman take the stage again my heart sinks and Im making ready to go. Nothing good is on the horizon when shes in this mood. Let us take a breather and talk about this tommorow I say. But she pushes me back so voilantly that Im afraid I have to fight my way out and shes strong. Its never a good idea for a man to end up in physicall brawl with a woman even if the intention only is to push her out of my way, I can only lose. She starts to cry and look mad now and goes on about how I cant go now when I been introduced to her family. I feel sorry for her, maybe it breaks her heart if I went. I calm her down, Im not leaving. I dont feel like going out at all anymore but she does. When we get there she is sulky and distant and rude to me all through the night with some exceptions infront of others. Another thing with her is that when she gets into her rages she seems to loose even her own sense of reality and she can look lost and start doubting even basic  things. She ones doubted I found a spider in my hair on a cafe toilet and she wanted to se the spider before she belived me. We been together off and on for 1 1/2 year now and even with a 6 month break she should know Im not gay... But she asks one of my aquintances after a minor childish joke between us. When we leave she wants to go home but as shes still in this unpredictable sulky mood the last thing I want to do is to go back with her to her place. I know Im going to a really cold place if I do. But if I tell her Im planning to go home instead now, she will explode... So againts better judgment I take her to a bar to talk things out. We sit down and I really want to bring out this other woman. Though deep inside its starting to dawn to me that the other woman doesnt exist... We sit down, and as warm and calm as possible I ask her whats really happening, trying desperatly to contact my love inside. She gets into a rage again mocking me calling me names starting to push me. Im getting angry now, I had enough! I tell her that tonight I will be going home to me and she gets even more furious than I dreaded. The only reason she can come up with for me not wanting to go with her, is that Im going to see someone else... Im always weary of the aggresivness inside me and with the years it takes much longer for me to get furiou,s but I know its there if pushed to much, its a survival \"fight or flight\" instict from my early years. My eyes locks into hers and my jaws tighten and I had enough, I want her to see a glipmse of the rage she doesnt want to awaken... But its not exactly my explosive rage I been tending in all the retreats over the years and as I take time to look at my self I feel comicly redicolous. More than that I feel sad and disgusted. Im thinking of her abusive ex I strangely always felt some symphaty with. He managed 10 years of this?! I ponder a little over who created who in that marriage... I withdraw into myself and meditation while she turns ballistic, trying to break my phone and glasses by repeatedly beating them from my hands and face calling me things. Shes all over the place screaming and waving, I never seen her like this. She storms out.. she comes back.. she text me from the lobby (hotel bar) I dont answer, she comes back hits the phone from my hands again storms out again. Shes like a wounded beast. I finish my drink quite proud of keeping my cool and temper even though I feel batterd. I even take my time to wonder how abnormal and unhealthy this really is, and how I probably ten years ago I would have made this whole situation increasingly worse. When I leave I meet her in the lobby and she starts to drag and push me wanting me to come with her but aggressively, not appologetic. I ask her why the hell I would go home with someone that call me names, mocks me and beats me? She pulls at my clothes and I push her away roaring for her to get away from me. When I turn to leave she hits me in the back of my head with her bag. She later says something on a text that I cant handle my drink and that I always turn another person when Im drinking. Maybe this was true 15 years ago and I probably told her about that at some point.\n\nEven after this Im hooked. When I go home all Im thinking is if this is it, have I lost her now? Im born into chaos like this and often wandered if Im addicted to it. What you are taught when your small becomes what you know and normal. It becomes a part of you. I know its useless to blame her the day after, nor is there any use in trying to get her to appologise as she already turned this thing around, and to be honest her last remark hit the spot. Was this me? I could drink myself sensless when young and often woke up with an anxiety worse than anything. I backtracked and even though I couldnt se what I did wrong it got me doubting just a little bit. I just wrote \"I love you\" in hope to undramatise the situation and letting her know I was still there for her. Clearly she has issues and if I dont blame but forgive her she can overcome her shame, seek the help she needs, get better and spend the rest of her life loving me... We texted and she blamed me as I suspected.\n\nLater I heard that some people that I actually knew including a security guard, had seen the whole episode outside the lobby and even heard me telling her to take off. A female friend said she felt sorry for me and that it looked awfull. This touched me somehow and I knew exactly the value of keeping my cool. If I had this control when I was a kid my life and selfimage would have been different. As I was always seen upon as \"troubled child\" with anger issues Im starting to see what the theatrics and apperances of an dishonest manipulator can do to both others superficial views of someone but also that persons inner perception of himself.\n\nAs I told  this to \"princess\" of course I got it all bounced back though she \"appologised\" for me getting her so mad that I pushed her into behaving in ways she never done before and it had left her feeling so \"embarased and vulnurable\"... I hoped she was too ashamed of what she had done that she wasnt ready to admitt it yet. She came around to talk. Instead of banging my head in an attempt to talk this over, I just pulled her close to me held her and talked to her lovingly with a hope she put her defences down and get real to what happend. It didnt happend, though she became my love again. We had a fantastic night, my love was back and so was my defiant hope. The following days I was out in the cold again. She hardly answerd my text but was online all the time etc.. Some days went and I became furious... I forgave so much and Im in the cold?! No, no no... I broke up with her one night and it seemed like she anticipated this. I wanted to put some distance between us so I didnt pull back on the ammo but I of course got it all back and more. Now she could see the real me, the mask had come of and she could se the evil manipulating me etc. She called but I refused to answer and she erased and blocked me from FB, she later lifted the block and I believe this for me to take contact again so I wrote that she can continue blocking me and that the mere thought of her turned my stomach and that I would never ever contact her again... She told me thats exactly what she wanted. That was four weeks ago and in an weak moment to regain something, and after reading up on all this online, I sent a text saying something like, thank you for helping me unwillingly to find something more valuable than gold. For this I will always be thankfull... She answerd me today with asking what I found. I understand only by those words that she again opend the door for persuasion and I feel like talking to her if only to have a better ending, but at this point I dont trust my self.\n\nThis is the third or fourth woman I been in a releationship with that has this traits, not counting my mother. Even though I seen the pattern and made random connections I didnt know there was so much precise psychological maping of both my own and what we refer to as \"narcisstic people\". I think that what hurts me the most now is similiar to the pain these people felt before shutting down, its not \"evil\" its their sanity that have shut down while attempting to make sense of something incredible cruel done to them. Just as I feel like shutting down my own feelings instead of being confronted with the fact that someone I loved and wanted to protect never even will recognise how much they hurt me. My mother was sexually abused by her own father and if I have any difficulty putting my self in her place inorder to understand this pain better I can only think of my daughter going trough anything like that. Being betrayed at an early age by the one person that was supposed to love and protect you just as you where about to explore who you were and the world around you, they pretending it never happend while you froze stiff by an unexplainable crippling fear...\n\nThank you all for being here!\n\nLove M",

I've gone LC since, haven't tried to explain anything to them and have been practicing my grey rock. And it's been going very well.\n\n\nBut honestly, guys, I am a tense little bunch of nerves about this. The closer I get, the more my jaw seems to be clenched when I wake up. I have stressy emergency thoughts and contingency plans about everything, all the time. \n\nAnd I don't want to not go - my aunt means a lot to me. And I live in another country, so I want to grab any chance I can at seeing my little great cousins. \n\nSo so far, my strategy is this:\n- rely on my mom wanting to make her big sister's day about herself: stay in the other end of any room as much as possible\n- never be alone with parents. Always drag husband or friendly family member along\n- practice gray rock in person (so fearing that. I have a temper)\n- actively seek out the kids and try to just have a play day\n- leave early \n\nAnd it all looks very well in writing. I am just so nervous -.-",

        "text": "My counselor has asked me many times why this was my last straw.  I'm not sure why.\n\nI lent my parents my life savings.  It may not be a lot to some people, but I was out of work for awhile/not fully employed/employed but not earning much.  I worked very very hard and denied myself a lot of things to build up my savings.  \n\nI lent my NParents the money because they were buying a house and needed to put down something like 5% cash.  Of course they didn't plan this (despite me telling them they'd have to do this).  They came to me a few days before closing begging for my savings (which were coincidentally just enough to fund the 5% cash requirement).  \n\nI promised to lend them the money, with the condition that we enter into a written contract, which I drew up.  They signed, I wired them the money.\n\nOne of the provisions of the contract required them to pay the money back to me the day after closing.  Surprise- the day after closing, no money.\n\n(The other hidden fact here is that my dad is a compulsive gambler.  Has lost many hundreds of thousands of dollars.  So I arranged for the money to go into my mom's bank account and for him to not touch it.  That was another part of the contract.)\n\nWell, I didn't hear from them the day after the closing.  Or the day after that.  And no money.  So I assumed my mom let my dad get at my money, that he stole it, and gambled it away.  And that they didn't want to fess up.\n\nAbout three and a half weeks after their closing, I got a call from them saying they were giving me back \"the\" money.  Not MY money- just \"the\" money.  And they were really snotty about it.  My mom said that I was lucky that they were paying me back, that they could have kept the money, and in fact, I \"owed\" it to them so they really shouldn't have to pay me back at all.  (I never borrowed any money from them so god knows why I would \"owe\" it to them).  I told her we had signed a contract and they didn't even give me the consideration of calling me the day after closing to let me know why it was late.  She went into this whole song and dance about why it was late and I told her I didn't care.  \n\nMy dad came on and said that I had an attitude, that it was technically \"their\" money, and that he was returning the \"f*cking\" money but that I owed it to them after I was a whore in college.  (I was raped/choked unconscious by someone I was dating, and unfortunately my parents found out, and said it was my fault and I brought it on myself because I chose to have premarital sex, and I caused THEM trouble and grief and had to repay THEM).  And how dare I even require a written contract with them for the money.  etc.\n\nI reminded my dad that they breached the contract that they entered into with me, and that his gambling addiction was the only reason I even required a contract.  I was called a \"b*tch\" and told that my f*cking money would be wired that day.  \n\nOk, fine.  I told them thanks, I see where I stand with them, and hung up.  Went LC, VLC (which included being slapped in the face by my Nmom) and finally NC.  \n\nMy counselor keeps saying that this cannot be the last straw for me, that they did other more serious things (severe abuse).  I agree, but this was a black and white situation.  We entered into a contract, they breached, and they didn't provide me with a reason for breaching until well after it was appropriate.   They can't explain it away or say it was my fault.  They couldn't even perform the terms of a simple contract or ask me for more time for repayment.  That's... disgusting.  All of the arguably worse times (which resulted in criminal charges, DYFS involvement, scars, permanent injuries etc.) just don't stack up that cleanly in my head.  But breaching a contract and treating me disrespectfully and acting entitled to the money that I scraped together for myself- that was my sticking point. \n\nI finally got the money back, but I didn't even care about the money at that point.  (I did use most of it on counseling, experimental drugs, a dietician, eating disorder treatment, fixing my jaw, and all the other stuff that resulted from a crap upbringing, so I'm glad I got it back and could put it to good use).  \n\nDoes anyone else have a moment like this where everything became clear to them about their NParents?   Where you just couldn't continue the charade anymore?",

I read his book, and thought he might be helpful. We talked for a while on the phone. He seemed kind of long winded, and kept asking if I read his book, but I figured I'd go in and see him, since it's only $10 on my health insurance.\n\nI asked him when he was free, and he said he could only do tomorrow (Tuesday) or Thursday. I asked him what his latest appointment was on Tuesday, because I had a family obligation that I had to attend that I wasn't sure how long would last. He told me that he had evening appointments, but that he would prefer 4pm, because he \"doesn't like evening appointments\". I told him that 4pm might be pushing it for me. He told me that was fine, and that he'd see me tomorrow.\n\nAt 2:15pm today, I called him to let him know  that I was still at the obligation, and I wanted to know if we could push the appointment back. He seemed hesitant, but said okay.\n\nI ended up calling him back a minute later, after conferring with the family to tell him I'd just have to move it to another today, perhaps Thursday.\n\nHis response?\n\n\"You're doing a lot of switching around, with this appointment time. I don't like that. You know, you should probably just find someone else to help you.\"\n\nI was shocked, and I told him okay, and hung up.\n\nWithin the next five minutes, he calls me twice, leaves no voicemail. On the third call, I pick up, and he says, \"Hi, I'm just calling you back. I've been having a bad day. I will still take you this evening, if that's what you want. But you can't keep doing this.\"\n\nI told him that I was looking for a counselor that was a bit more personable, and was no longer interested and hung up.\n\nWas that crazy, or what? I realize me trying to move the appointment time was kind of annoying, but.....that seems a little unprofessional to me!",

Okay, mid-40's here, spend a good couple decades working on the adulting/functional human being skills with generally good success.\n\nI got zero help in my FOO- a request for help was likely to make things significantly worse.  My Ndad, in particular, is rigid, controlling, and doesn't know the limits of his competence- google \"Dunning-Kruger\" and there you go.\n\nBasically, asking for help was likely to end up with me in tears and shaking with rage, and whatever problem needed help compounded 1000 fold.  \n\nSo, when I got loose of the Ns, I was very well trained to never ask for help and to just figure it out on my own or to make do without it.  \n\nFiguring it out and making do without are useful skills in life, but if you actually want to get anywhere in the world and to have real actual intimate relationships, you have to be able to ask for help and to be vulnerable, at least at times.\n\nSo, I've been working on that for a good two decades, but I have a FLEA I am really, really struggling with, and I'd very much appreciate any suggestions.\n\nWhen I have to ask someone- not an intimate, just a random- for help, and they half ass it or screw it up- I am primed for instant massive rage and despair.  \n\nThis morning's example- I need a medical test.  My doctor's office told me the test was a walk-in.  It's not.  My doctor's office has had phone problems for the last six months and I'm going to have go face-to-face with them to get this sorted and wait at least two months for the test.  \n\nI don't need help actually fixing the doctor's office problem.  I have good assertiveness skills.  I can and will do it, no problem, and I may be able to figure out a way to game the system to push up the test date.\n\nWhat I would LOVE to know if any one else has found a solution for is my *absolutely incandescent rage and despair* when I ask for help- help I genuinely need (I cannot get this test myself, I cannot ignore this problem any more) and I come up against this kind of just-don't-give-the-tiniest-fuckity-fuck and/or no-clue-dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks behavior.\n\nI understand I've been conditioned to explode in these situations.  I am able to hang tight through it until I'm calm enough to deal with the humans involved (mostly).\n\nBut, this kind of crap makes me feel so absolutely alone.  It makes me so disgusted with people.   It makes me feel like no one gives a fuck whether I'm alive or dead and that I might as well just *be* dead.  It just opens up the pit to my childhood and all of that despair.  I spend a few hours hating humanity and just generally being disgusted with the selfishness and ugliness of the human species.  I, like many of us, don't ever really *forget* about the abyss, but I am usually able to say \"Okay, you can look into the abyss or you can look into the clouds.  You only have one life, and it's short, and then you're dead forever.  Choose.\"  \n\nThe situation of needing help, bringing myself to ask for help (which I suspect I will never actually enjoy doing, even though I can do it now), and then getting totally dismissed throws me into the pit, every time.\n\nAnyone else?\n\nAny solutions, other than to spend a few hours hoping for a pandemic that leads to humanity's complete extinction as a species before snapping out of the despair/fury spiral?  \n\nOh, and ironically … I need the medical test because I have shortness of breath that is preventing me from vigorously exercising  (exercise does work nicely to snap me out of rage/despair), so while I am usually \"yay, exercise, run, run, run away\" that's sadly not an option any more.  \n\nThank you, RBN/LAN, for being here.  \n\nI value the community here a great deal and I am very grateful for all of you.",

        "text": "Hey, LAN! I usually post to RBN, but I've found the whole network to be helpful and understanding so maybe you guys could offer some insight? Thanks for reading.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLast September I decided to try to go back to therapy. I hadn't been in treatment for two years due to lack of insurance and reliable transportation but now that I had that (and my PTSD symptoms were back in full force) I decided to give it another go. I got numbers from my insurance company and set out calling.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQuite a few declined even a phone consultation after I mentioned I'm trans. More said they weren't capable of providing long term care (which is typical for PTSD treatment). I made it into a few people's offices and even got past medical records released to them and every. Single. Time. They suddenly couldn't treat me and referred me elsewhere.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirstly, I'm curious as to what dark secret is in my records that's apparently such a red flag. My last therapist said I was his easiest client to work with. I knew what I needed to do, stuck to the treatment plan, and only saw him once a month or as needed for extra guidance and support. I no longer live in the area or else I'd just go back to him, he was great and I think we did great work together.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI understand how and why some people are more difficult to treat (my father has a personality disorder and changed therapists as often as he changed his socks, was paranoid, lied frequently, refused to accept diagnosis, etc). But I'm not combative or needy (in 2 years of therapy w/the last guy I never once called/text/emailed him), or flaky. I always did the homework I was assigned to the best of my ability and was open to criticism and direction. I never no showed and always rescheduled appts w/48 hour notice (which is common courtesy and ensured I wouldn't be billed for the session). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've pretty much run out of options that cover my insurance. When I press as to why such and such can't treat me (not arguing - if they can't, they can't - but just asking for clarification), they give me reasons that, frankly, sound like bullshit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"We don't offer crisis services.\" Cool, I'm not in crisis and if I was, I already have a number for that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"We don't offer evening hours.\" Funny, I never said I needed that. I work around their availability.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"We don't specialize in treating trans people.\" Sweet, that will not be the focus of my treatment!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just don't understand what's going on here. I know transphobia is a real consideration and I've heard therapists don't like treating incest/child exploitation survivors because it's 'complex' (read: icky and time consuming) but it seems pretty fucked up to punish survivors for something that *they didn't do to themselves.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIDK, I'm trying to manage a painful and sometimes frightening disorder. I have money, insurance, a legitimate medical need, and a real desire for help. Why can't I get it? What am I doing wrong here? Any insight is appreciated.",

        "text": "My NMom is a classic N. Everyone here knows the type. I am VLC/NC for 9 months, except talking briefly every few months (through text). Interacting with her is detrimental to my health under normal conditions/circumstances. \n\nOver the last few months, she has gotten \"softer\". She isn't mean/demanding when she texts me, and her voicemails aren't loud/nasty anymore. There is little to none of her previous manipulation/guilt trip. She will text me things like \"Are you okay?\" or invite me to events that I would legitimately want to go to (festivals, movies/lunch, she organized a birthday party for my grandmother (gma and I are close, but Nmom has never thrown a party for her before).) I haven't attended any of these events, and have politely declined without giving reasons or have not responded at all. \n\nMy question is: For those VLC/LC, has the N in your life turned around? I am interested in having a healthy relationship with my parents, even if LC. I am wondering if she will now treat me like a guest- someone who is treated very well- or still as a scapegoat. What have been your experiences? I feel like I am missing out on the parent-child relationship, and will settle for scraps as long as they aren't too spoiled. The way she acts is the deciding factor- VLC or LC- but I don't want to undo the progress I've made to find out unless I absolutely have to. I figured I could try to learn from your experiences first! \n\n\nTLDR: Has your N changed behaviors after VLC/NC? Do they treat you better now (permanently) or is being nice a textbook tactic that I should be wary of? Fearful of undoing mental health progress, yet desire a relationship (even if it is LC). ",

        "text": "[This was going to be one question, but I decided to do a bit of back story. Turns out there's &gt;3600 words here. I’m not a good writer, and I am bad at being concise. Have written down everything I can remember right now. I apologise if this is too much or makes little sense. I’m an emotional wreck and mentally ill and not amazingly stable today. There's a TL;DR at the bottom]\n\nI met P when I was 13, and she was 11/12. Our parents worked together. We liked the same music and I showed her MSN messenger and that was that.\n\nShe lived in the middle of nowhere and struggled to make friends in school (something I identified with), so we spoke quite a lot in the evenings when I got home from school. I introduced her to all my school friends online (she lived quite a way out) and she used to visit us all in the holidays and stay with me.\n\nI pretended I didn't know she was calling me names to my friends behind my back, and I pretended it didn't matter that they weren't telling me about it. (Someone sent me a chat log once, and obviously hadn't realised that the bitching about me was in there, I was too scared back then to lose my friends.)\n\nShe moved to the area for college, and I got to see her a bit more often. I came out as transgender somewhere around this time (non-binary, Female at birth. It’s an identity, but it isn’t obvious from appearance, I don’t care if people see me as female unless they’re people close enough to me to know better. I’m only mentioning it because it’s relevant later.)\n\nShe learned to drive as soon as she was old enough, but I never learned because my family didn't have the money (remember how I said our parents worked together? They were paid the same amount.) so if she wanted to do something together she would usually ask me if I wanted a ride. If she didn't want to give me a ride, I would have been happy to use public transport, but she would always offer to give me a ride.\n\nEvery time we argued, she would tell me that I was just using her because she could drive. Every time we argued I would tell her I would get the bus.\n\nWhen we started talking again, she would be back to giving me a ride, because she \"loved driving\" and \"didn't mind\". If I tried to refuse she would insist.\n\nI suffered from some serious anxiety, and ended up with a diagnosis of BPD (which is a wide and varied disorder, and despite not meeting the minimum criteria as outline by the DSM, I was diagnosed anyway, but never mind, I got quite a bit of benefit from the therapy I received as a result) and agoraphobia, among a few other things. This also came with being on long-term sick leave from work.\n\nP's idea of helping was to regularly fill me with alcohol and get me drunk, then \"take me\" clubbing.\n\nShe also kept pushing fad diets at me, because her understanding seemed to be that I wasn't mentally ill, but only depressed because of my weight. (This eventually led onto telling everyone that I was faking having a mental illness. Telling ME that I was faking having a mental illness.) But fine, I'm overweight, maybe I should do more exercise anyway, so we agreed to go swimming together. She joined my gym, and when I was off work we would go when she wasn't studying (she went on to university [which is different to college here], and I went into work). When I returned to work she would often appear at the door to my work and we'd go from there.\n\nI didn't lose weight. I still haven't, I've made peace with it now, and to be honest, I'd mostly already made peace with it back then, but she was fairly insistent, so I believed her that I might be happier if I wasn't as fat. I was already going to a gym, but more exercise wasn't a bad thing.\n\nMy lack of results seemed to frustrate her, and so she would seek reasons to embellish upon my awareness of my weight. I remember once she \"offered\" to help put sun lotion on my back at a friend's back garden, and then completely filled her hand with lotion and slathered it on, stopping in my fat rolls and making stupid sucking noises and flapping them about and pretending her hand was stuck. I was so smothered in this lotion that my back was still smothered hours later.\n\nThis became her mission to “make [me] look like a person again.”\n\nThis implication that I wasn’t a person was normality to me by now. Somewhere along the line we’d gotten to a point where we could look at old photos together as kids and be nostalgic about them. Except they were always slightly sullied by “This is back when you were a person”. Which was a reference to any picture before I came out as trans.\n\nShe met a boy on OKC and I went with her to meet him the first time. We ended up going to his house, getting pizza, and getting horrendously drunk). He was chill and funny, but when he wrapped an arm around her and kissed her she pulled a face at me like he was disgusting her.  He pulled out the sofa bed at the end of the evening, and she opted to sleep with him, rather than share the sofa with me. All the way home the next morning she told me he had a tiny penis and was terrible in bed. I remained friends with him, although I admit I never told him this until she had told him herself. He’s one of my closest friends now, and in a relationship with my best friend.\n\nA friend of ours was in the fetish scene, and invited me to a club one night. Now, I'm pretty fucking vanilla, but everyone there was super-cool and I had an amazing time. I didn't feel self-conscious the entire night, people were lovely, and I couldn't wait to go back.\n\nThe next time the even rolled around (it was once every two months or something), P had jumped onto this and wanted in. She bought a lot of latex gear for the night (I had no idea she was into this, I still have no idea if she is into this) and I decided to get a bikini set as the theme was \"Pirates, beaches and something\" or something or other. The theme wasn't obligatory, but there was usually enough people meeting the theme for it to be clear.\n\nWe were getting dressed at mine, and P was asking all sorts of questions, not about just about the club, but about my choice of dress for the club. (\"Are there fat lovers there, then?\" \"Won't you feel uncomfortable if everyone can see your chub?\" \"Aren't you worried that people might say something.\")\n\nShe squeezes herself into her latex dress and then I get \"Would you fuck me?\". I really struggle with compliments, but I can generally pass off \"You look great\" and sound sincere even if I don't mean it (I usually do, I just get really anxious complimenting people that they will think I'm trying to come onto them, this is a stupid thing that has stuck since I was really little and kids are cruel bastards and apparently \"I like your nail polish\" means \"I'm a big lesbian for you\" when you're six.) however I really do draw the line at telling something I'd fuck them. I don't even tell my boyfriend that I'd fuck him, and I fuck him! This goes back and forwards \"You look nice\" \"But would you fuck it\" \"We're going out for fun, does it matter?\" \"I need to know\" \"I'm not sexually into you\" \"That doesn't matter, would you fuck me?\"\n\nI think eventually I just said yes and made myself a bigger drink. She tells me I'm not wearing enough makeup, waxes on about how this night had better be good because she spent so much on this dress, which led onto how I wasn't making an effort (I bought a bikini for £5, because I have bills and rent to pay, and I kind of still wanted to wear more clothes than make-up).\n\nWe get to this party and she clams up. Completely stiff, and my friend texts that they can't make it tonight. So I try to show her around and introduce her to people that I remember, but she's mostly quiet, obviously having a bad time and we end up sitting on a bench in a corner whilst she tries to get a selfie of us (which will always go online about what a good time she's having, regardless of what a bad time she might be having.)\n\nThere's a photographer there and he offers to take a picture, we say OK, and he gives us a card with link to his site (and password etc, because discretion) where we will be able to download it the next day. She takes the card and thanks him. We go outside for a cigarette (this happens throughout most nights, we're both smokers, particularly when drinking) and she seems a bit calmer and says she's worried about people staring at me. I say no one has been staring (I am seriously paranoid, and this was one of the few places where I DID NOT feel like people were staring) but she was insistent that they were. I say it didn't matter if they are, and she just pulls a face.\n\nWe're outside. I'm in a bikini, in the street, and this is where she decided to play up on my paranoia. Fortunately, I was distracted by a guy walking past and asking what what’s going on. There's a few people in the smoking area, (although she made sure only I would hear her) and people tell him. He seems interested. Not \"let me in\" interested, but not \"freak show\" interested. I think it was just unusual to him and he was intrigued, some people put some serious fucking effort into making their gear. One guy there makes his own full latex suits that even cover his face except his lips, and eyes, and make him look like a woman despite the full beard hidden behind the mask (he is not trans, just in case anyone is concerned here that I'm misgendering him). This passer-by is complimenting everyone and definitely managing to not be creepy. He says he liked my bikini. P suddenly wants to speak to him now. and I wish I remembered what she said, because he left quickly after that. I can’t remember it being anything that stood out, but then most of what I’ve said so far didn’t really stand out to me as a problem at the time.\n\nSo we head back in because there’s a magic show about to start (there was always an entertainment thing in the middle of these. The organisers really do pull out all the stops for these nights and I sometimes wish I still went). The magicians come onto the stage and it’s this hardcore-looking metal dude (who hammers a nail into his nasal cavity and lets people pull on it! Gross), and this chubby, drop dead gorgeous lady in a dress that has those sort of patterns you see on kimonos. I remember that dress because it was awesome. Anyway, some time after the show, I pass this lady on the stairs, and she tells me, “You look a goddess, and people should worship at your feet.”(this is verbatim because I will always treasure these words even though they’re from a stranger. I wish I knew who she was so I could tell her how much her words meant to me.) I thanked her and told her how much I loved her show and her dress. (I can’t remember what I said here, and it’s probably for the best, because as I explained further up, I am really awkward and uncomfortable about complimenting people. In fact, it’s fucking rare that I get complimented and feel good about it, but this woman fucking scored some seriously love-points from me.)\n\nThis is enough for P, who now insists she’s tired and wants to go home quite loudly. (It’s barely gone midnight. P usually insists on waiting until a club closes, and then walking the streets for a 24 hour food place.)\n\nI ended up going back to mine with her, and bathing her (I don’t even know how the fuck I ended up having to do this!) before bed.\n\nFast forward a couple of days and I remember that she had the link to the photo. I ask if she still has the link. “Oh yeah, I downloaded it.” And she sends me the photo.\n\nNow. She is seriously good at photoshop.\n\nShe photoshopped me skinny.\n\nI asked for the original. She doesn’t have it.\n\nI asked for the original link. She won’t give it.\n\nThe photo looks better this way. She was embarrassed by the before photo.\n\nI wish I’d kept the photo, to remind me how she made me feel that day, because I have never felt so disgusted with my own body in my life than being photoshopped to look “better”.\n\nIt didn’t sink in right away, and it was a few days before I finally cut contact. I suddenly got constant spam phonecalls from companies trying to sell me PPI, claiming I’d been in a car accident and could claim compensation, you know the kind. I also got texts like this. They dwindled down and eventually I changed my number anyway.\n\nApparently after I did that she went off the rails, found a new friend, did a horrendous amount of drugs (I’m not against drug use, it’s common in the area, but being responsible is kind of important), and sleeping with a different man every night (again, I know sex workers and I know people who just like lots of sex, but there’s still an amount of behaving responsibly involved. P was regularly telling me that she can’t feel sex with a condom on, and would only take it in the ass [higher risk of STI contraction] and eventually tried to kill herself and ended up in hospital.\n\nI, on the other hand, had gotten a little bit more stable. Had begun attending things on my own that I wasn’t allowed to do before. I became really close friends with a woman online that eventually moved to this country and settled down here with the boy from earlier that P slept with. We’re now best friends. Made friends with the neighbours (in 7 years I hadn’t met, or spoken to any of my neighbours), and became very close with the lady next door, and started swimming with her, at a different place. I ended my gym subscription (my contract ran out at my job, so I couldn’t afford it any more) and whilst I wasn’t losing weight, my weight stabilised and I haven’t gained since. \n\nDid I mention I had introduced her to all my friends?\n\nOddly enough, when someone tries to commit suicides after you stop talking to them. People will stop talking to you. I got very few messages from friends for a while. I occasionally got a party invite, which I went to, because I was fucking lonely, and still kind of hoped people were friends with me.\n\nThis meant that I ended up at the same party with her at new year. We were civil to each other (having to share the same veranda to smoke on does that to you) and parted ways at the end of the evening.\n\nThe next party we both end up at is in October, at which I’m again outside, with a few others, when she tells me I’m “Ignoring her, still hate her, [she] held out an olive branch for [me] at the last party but [I] shat on [her].” I’ve been drinking and break down, apologising over and over again whilst she’s screaming at me that I was the reason she tried to kill herself.\n\nI agree to add her on Facebook, and she messages me every couple of days. I have to give proper replies otherwise she says I’m ignoring her. Occasionally she manages to convince me to come out (starting with asking if I could babysit for a friend when they went out [£20 for sitting in someone’s house whilst the kid slept? Sure] and then going out to that friend’s birthday bash a few weeks later.) but I always seemed to come home feeling super-drained. She goes swimming with me once (and complained because I went to an unheated pool now so it was cold. I had forewarned her of this.) but for the most part we manage to stay distant. \n\nExcept for when she’d been drinking, and then she’d insult the friends I’d made without her, how they were all “spergs” (P’s favourite word to describe anyone who is nerdy in a way she would consider unacceptable. Coming from the word “aspergers” which, some of these people had, and some didn’t.) which apparently made them bad friends. I’d ignore it, put it down to her being drunk.\n\nWe’d end up at the same parties and I’d get the same shit because people were watching, but never felt I could say anything because people laughed along with her.\n\nShe would occasionally comment on my Facebook statuses, but never to say anything positive. When people were complimenting my new profile picture she put “Gormless” and then later “Sorry. Gorgeous*”, if I posted about how I was angry she would post “I’m sure they’re quivering in their boots”. Eventually she made fun of me on a comment and my best friend pointed out exactly what her behaviour on my wall was like. They argued for a bit. Suddenly P just started spamming me with loveheart emojis.\n\nI never spoke to her again. I started a new Facebook account so she wouldn’t realise right away because I just didn’t want to deal with her shit. I blocked her and everyone who knows her before adding anything to it. A mutual friend contacted me on the old account and asked why I was ignoring her. I told him and he said I was being manipulated by my best friend because she is in a relationship with someone P slept with once and then spoke to like shit and harassed until he had to call the police. He apologised later. I’ve seen him twice since then (3 months ago), and only talk when I start a conversation. His profile picture is them two clubbing together now. So I’m fairly certain he has chosen a side, despite his claims not to. He says I shouldn’t cut her off because she might try to kill herself again, and when I said that her effect on my MH may lead to my own suicide, he dismissed it and said “yeah but she’s ACTUALLY ill”. (Because apparently I’m not.)\n\nSo basically that’s now. I have friends who I love. 2 people from the group stuck besides me when I went NC this time. One who she also turned on at the last party, getting laughs by calling him Alopecia (a condition that he has which caused his hair to fall out and grow back in white in places) all night. He had shrugged it off until his girlfriend pointed out to him when he got home just how fucked up that was, and she couldn’t understand why any of us are friends with her.\nThat’s an ongoing thing. People who meet her and know her seem to join in on her treatment of others. Maybe it’s charisma, maybe it’s fear. I have no idea. But people who hear about her and have never met her, can’t understand why any of us are friends with her.\n\nSo in total. I have 4 friends I know in person. Most people have left me. 2 have just had a kid so are a bit pre-occupied (which is cool, they gotta have that bonding time) and the other 2 don’t live in the local area).\nI have friends online, but I rarely talk anymore. I don’t know why. Somewhere over these years I went from being really talkative and talking to anyone about anything. Now I tell people very little about myself. My partner of 8 and a half years says I don’t even talk to him like I used to (I've not brought him into the story because I can't even bare to write down the shit she had to say about my relationship with him). I feel like I’ve forgotten how to make friends. I have worked at my current employment for a year and I still don’t feel like I know anyone. Someone at work the other day said I remind them of a robot. I feel like one.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Friends with Narcissist for 14 years\n\n* Told I'm not a person\n\n* Regular mentions about my weight\n\n* Insults me in front of people but I thought it was normal for years because my friends laughed.\n\n* Took years to finally get uncomfortable enough to end friendship\n\n* Stupidly Go back\n\n* Non-Mutual friend points out NFriend's abusive behaviours.\n\n* Ended friendship with NFriend\n\n* Almost all other friends went with her.\n\n* Lonely and don't know how to cope.\n \nWhere do I go from here?",

I want to get the right care so I can carry on with my life, but it's really hard trying to get through the day with intense anxiety, and then the depression that follows in this weird little cycle that I can't break. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you make it go away? I'm open to pretty much everything except illicit drugs.\n\nMy biggest worry is that my intense dread and anxiety will keep me from getting better because I won't practice. I get restless when I do school work even at my best, even though I'm fairly bright- so with this stress it's a little harder.\n",
