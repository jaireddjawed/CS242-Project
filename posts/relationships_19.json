        "text": "Hi redditors,\n\nMy partner (M37) and I (F29) (we dated for a year and a half) just broke up this weekend. He was basically everything I wanted in a partner, so I am extremely heart broken and miss him so much. The reasons why we broke up were a mixture of things.\n\nHe’s been depressed these last two months due to the winter weather, loved ones being sick, and not working (he’s self employed and there hasn’t been much work available). A few weeks ago we almost broke up as he felt that our relationship wasn’t going anywhere. He said he had a gut feeling that we were going to not be happy together in the long run. He said he felt that we were too different (we have some interests but not many), too much an age gap (I’m 29F, he’s 37M), that we don’t have enough “passion” and that he worries we won’t have enough challenging in depth conversation in our life because our life is very simple and “predictable”. He was worried that our relationship views were too different- ex. I believe you need to have healthy relationships with friends and family outside of your relationship, and he believes that your partner needs to be your everything because your friends move away as we get older. He said he’s felt this way for a while. As a result, he stopped drinking for two weeks to see if this would change his mood and as a result, he said he was still waking up depressed thinking about the outcome of our relationship. As a result, we called it quits.\n\nI suggested couples therapy but he doesn’t think it’ll work. He’s open to individual therapy but he hasn’t started it yet. I don’t know if what he’s going through is because we aren’t right for each other, or if it’s because he has commitment issues. He told me that he’s been dating women for 20 years, and that he’s probably only been in relationships for 7 years of his life. He says he always goes for the wrong person. He’s mentioned he wonders if he does have commitment issues as one of his parents has remarried three times, and the other never remarried and only had small meaningless relationships.\n\nI’m just trying to get a better understanding of this situation. Our relationship was almost perfect. We rarely fought, we were both so caring and loving to one another, we always had fun going out, the hobbies and interests we did have together were always enjoyable to do, we had the same values and views about society. We both agreed that this is the best, healthiest relationship we’ve ever been in.\n\nMy question is: has anyone been in a similar situation before? Does this sound more like a commitment issue or a “they’re definitely the one” sort of thing? Any input would be appreciated.\n\nTldr; unsure if partner and I broke up due to his commitment issues or if we just weren’t meant to be, need advice/input.",

        "text": "Does anyone else struggle with attraction? I’ve been dating this guy since the start of the year and he recently asked me to be his girlfriend (and I said yes). It’s my first relationship. \n\nI get on really well with him and we have such a laugh. Our dates go on for hours and we talk for hours on the phone in between. I really like his personality and vibe. I feel very emotionally connected to him and do feel like I have, or am catching, strong feelings for him. \n\nHowever, I find my physical attraction for him ebbs and flows and I don’t know why. He’s not objectively unattractive, but he has quite an interesting face with strong features. When I first saw him for the very first time (we met through a dating app), I wasn’t super attracted to his looks - I just thought he looked okay. Then about halfway through the date I looked at him and thought he looked handsome. On all our dates ever since it’s been like this - from some perspectives, I think he looks really handsome, but from others I just don’t feel that attracted and I feel bad. \n\nPart of me wonders whether I’ve made a mistake committing to him. I’m an over thinker and it’s been stressing me out. Sometimes on our dates I feel like I’m analysing his looks and it’s distracting me. I feel like he deserves someone who thinks he’s gorgeous all the time, and I also deserve to not feel doubt about my partner’s looks. \n\nOn the other hand, I’ve suffered with low self esteem for most of my life and am highly critical of my own looks and a terrible perfectionist. I also do think deep down I am afraid of commitment and hurting someone/getting hurt myself. I sometimes wonder if those factors in turn make me highly critical of other people’s looks and I’ll use it as an excuse to dump them. That being said, before I said yes to being his girlfriend, I’ve dated other people where I didn’t question their looks (but I ended things due to us being incompatible for other reasons), so clearly I know when I find someone physically attractive. \n\nNot sure if anyone can relate and offer some advice? I really don’t want to hurt him but also don’t want to let my overthinking ruin things, make a rash decision and throw away something good. Thank you in advance.\n\nTLDR: for some reason I struggle to feel consistently attracted to my boyfriend. Sometimes I find him attractive, other times I’m not so sure. I worry that I’m nitpicking and overthinking. Should I end things?",

        "text": "TLDR: my boyfriend has been so tired from his new 6 day job, he hasn't been as affectionate as usual and when I brought it up, he said he wanted me to leave so he could think about our future together.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. Before this, I was single for a very long time after a really bad break up that took me a while to move on from. I genuinely think there's potential for us to be together for a really long time since we connect on so much and I've never met anyone who understands me as much as he does. \n\nRecently, he has just started a career in something he's really passionate in. For this job, he has to do training alongside this job so he will be essentially working 6 days a week while also studying for exams for that job so he will be very busy. I fully support him during this change and although it will take a lot of work, this is a much better outcome for him in the long run. \n\nHowever, this change has made him very tired and drowsy. This has led him to wanting him to be less couplely I guess? We haven't been on a proper date in ages and we spend most of our time together chilling in bed. This isn't necessarily a problem since I love a good stay-in date but it was becoming all we do. This week was the first week that he had a weekend off and I asked if he wanted me to come down and see him since I attend college during the week so I don't stay the night often. He said yes and I came down to see him. \n\nDuring this weekend trip, he continued to be less coupley. He didn't kiss me when I entered his house and as always, we just went straight to his bedroom. I was hoping we would at least go get lunch or something since he finally had a weekend off but I left it cause I understand that he's been working so hard so I didn't mind him being less affectionate than usual because he's become so tired after working so hard.\n\nHowever, I do want to preface first by saying it's not that big of an issue for me. The reality is that I'm also a busy college student and I'm in the middle of getting my BA so in my head, I don't really mind if he's less affectionate than usual cause I've been pretty busy too so shit happens. Of course, I would much rather him be more affectionate but for now, I can deal with it so that we can get it out of the way and move into the next stage of our relationship. To me, it was nice to just see him. \n\nThat night he ended up falling asleep early so I did the same. The next day, I woke up at 9am and he was still asleep. I attempted to sneak in a morning cuddle and he just groaned in his sleep and turned away. I took that as a sign to let him sleep and I put on my headphones to watch some YouTube on my phone. He ended up sleeping until 2pm in the afternoon. I attempted to cutely distract him again by moving closer to initiate some intimacy. He didn't get what I was doing and just looked at me. In our relationship, we do kissy faces to basically ask for kisses (it's cringe I know 🤣) but this is what we normally did and in return, he gave me a quick peck and pulled back. \n\nI kept doing it while still only receiving quick pecks in return so he eventually asked \"I'm not giving you anymore until you tell me what you want\". He said it jokingly but then I replied that I wanted cuddles and he practically begrudgingly held his arm up so I could lean into his chest. I started becoming slightly annoyed so I told him to just turn on the TV. We watched for a bit but I ultimately told him I was bored and he asked what I wanted to do and I was like ANYTHING. He said he didn't know what we could do since he didn't want to go anywhere so I just outright asked him if he wanted me here. He kept saying he did and that he just wanted to do nothing since he's been working so much and he's tired so I said: \n\n\"And I get that but it feels like I'm just 'here' so would you rather do nothing or do nothing with me?\" \n\nAnd that caught him off guard so I called him out on not being that affectionate recently. We had a long conversation about it and as mentioned, I don't mind that much since I'm busy in college. My only issue that I had was that he was so relaxed with that concept and I wanted him to be aware that it is a issue. It is an issue I can deal with right now because of our situations but ultimately its not right so when our situations are better, it should change at said point. \n\nHowever, he took me even mentioning it as a \"problem\" in our relationship and that he should fix it right now. So he essentially asked how he could fix it and I said the answer is pretty simple but I'm not expecting a solution. He said he can't accomplish that because of his situation and I kept trying to say its not that big of a deal because of that so I didn't mind leaving it since there might be points where I could be distant too. \n\nThis led into a whole conversation about our future and he questioned the idea of us breaking up. I told him I 150% DO NOT want to break up. For me, this is such a minuscule thing and the love I have for him is stronger by so much. I just saw this as us bickering like an old married couple. This back and forth went on for ages until he said \"I think I need some time to think\" so I took that as a cue to leave. \n\nI see this entire thing as just a mere disagreement that came about because of our situations. Of course, it isn't ideal and I do wish he was still being affectionate but I cannot fathom the idea of breaking up and it broke me to even hear him suggest that. I haven't said anything to him since and he hasn't texted me yet either. What should I do? I'm so scared he's going to break up and I don't want that after everything we've been through together. Should I try text him? Should I wait for him? Should I apologise? Any advice would be great to hear cause I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I just need a little advice because this is just constantly on my mind these days. I have a lot of trust issues and have been very hurt by my husband before. He and I separated about a year ago and he went to Miami and I stayed at our house in Atlanta with our 2 children (ages 4 and 6.) I had minimal contact with him during this time, except for house-related or kids things. The reason we separated in the first place was because his jealousy and abuse was getting worse and worse. He would check my phone, make me change clothes, get so angry at me for being \"too nice\" to male cashiers and servers. He started grabbing my face and pulling too hard at my wrists, and eventually slapped me as well (not that hard, more like a tap to the side of my head but still. That was really the last straw and we agreed to separate. He did apologize for his actions and has been remorseful and I know he is the father of our children but I just didn't want to deal with him after he hit me like that. \n\nLast month, we had a birthday party for our daughter, and he and his family were present. I mean, we are still all on good terms. Both our families just think we are taking a long break because of issues but we'll eventually make up. At the party, I did sort of befriend him again and we kissed at the end of the day, and we have been talking again.\n\nThe kids obviously love that he is home more often and I do enjoy this nicer, calmer version of him. But I keep wondering, how can you tell if a person has really changed? We talked for a long time about how much he hurt me and how I will never accept him putting hands on me again, and he promised he would never, that he is against violence against women and that it was a huge stupid mistake from him in the moment. We talked about how he has calmed down in life now after his year away which made him realize how much he needs me and the kids and how he's ready to be a better father and husband for our family now and to give him a chance to prove it. \n\nWe have another birthday party for our son this time in April, and he has asked if he could cut his lease on the Miami apartment and bring all his stuff back when he flies to the party. I told him we'll see. He has been doing well and being good to me lately... but how do I trust that he's changed? Or do I need to just let him back in the house and we see how he's changed when he gets here?\n\n**Tl;Dr: Husband and I separated for a year due to him being too jealous and possessive towards me. Last month we had a party for our daughter so I saw him again and we started reconciling our relationships. I have some trust issues because of him and I'm not sure how I can tell if a person has really changed... we have another party for our son in April and he asked if he could move back in at that time. I am not sure. How can you tell if a person has changed? Or do I need to give him a chance to prove that he's changed?**",

        "text": "Details are somewhat vague because I know they use Reddit as well.\n\n\nSo, I've been with them for about 4 years now, meeting in undergraduate. The majority of our relationship has been long distance. \n\n\nThis year I was accepted to and began attending graduate school in another state. I moved across the country and we kept things going long distance for several months before they moved out to be near me. \n\n\nPrior to them moving I made it very clear that I was devoted to grad school and that I wanted to make sure they knew I would be busy and focused and not as available. They also said they wanted to pursue a graduate program of their own while working a job here in the same desired field. While they have moved out here, they are now considering a completely different program that was not the aforementioned goal. They seem to have absolutely zero concern about debt which is worrisome to me, as I very much budget, plan, and try and save.  \n\n\nSince moving out, they have been super sweet and are very much devoted to me. While this is something I do love and find attractive, I am their whole world... They struggles to make friends and do not have a close relationship with any of my friends or family; they are extremely jealous of any of my female friends, and have even gotten jealous about time I've spent with my sister. Our relationship is fairly good, though we both have a lot that we can continue to improve upon. So much so, that I have had friends and family ask me if I really am happy, and how different they act around me (warm, kind, friendly) vs around others (cold, distant, dismissive). \n\n\nOur day to day is usually nice but ever since first visiting the grad school I am attending, I have been extremely interested in someone in my classes. I've never been as instantly drawn to someone as I have with this person, and I certainly have never had that feeling reciprocated prior to meeting them (which I have had confirmed by other classmates telling me this person was into me and people assuming we were a thing). I haven't acted on any of these feelings but I can't help but to think about how things could be. We'd even gone out with a group of classmates for an event hosted by the school and I'd ended up at their place alone... They were giving me every signal that they wanted me to make a move, but being that I was in a relationship I couldn't do anything and live with myself / my conscious.\n\n\nI can't help but think that if I'm still this infatuated by someone else and wishing/ wanting for what I don't have that maybe I should move on. However... we were each other's \"firsts\" for many things and when I had tried to end things previously (much earlier when I first moved away) it did not go well and they convinced me to give long distance a try after continuously begging, crying, and calling me selfish on the phone.... I folded and here we are...\n\n\nI can't help but think that staying with them would be the \"safe\" option, but our career goals are so different and I don't want for either of us to compromise our aspirations. I've never been the biggest risk taker, and while I don’t love being single, I just can't shake the thought of this other person... On at least one or more occasions since meeting we've ended up alone or nearly alone and there was this incredible tension, like both of us were waiting for the other to say something, or kiss the other/ take some sort of action.\n\n\nIs there any way I can somehow express this to them in a way that wouldn't hurt their feelings? They are much more committed than I am and enjoy dreaming about things like marriage, children, and our futures while I have been more focused on the here and now and achieving rather than dreaming. I should have much earlier put an end to those conversations but have continued to have them and entertain them because they are sweet thoughts and I didn't want to hurt them. While there were times I could see that future they/ we talk about, it isn't all the time, and I feel as though there should be no doubt if I'm to be as committed as they are, and that it is not fair for them to be strung along while I'm having these feelings of uncertainty.\n\n\nShould / could I say something to this other person? I'm almost certain they know I'm interested and I wouldn't want to miss out on a chance because I've spent so much time thinking and overthinking about it and then psyching myself out. I almost want to say something along the lines of \"hey, I can't seem to shake the thought of you and haven't been able to since we've met. I've been in and out of a relationship which I've been unhappy in, and they followed me up here which is why I haven't pursued you any further or said anything. I can't help but think that you might feel the same, if not I completely understand but I would kick myself forever if I didn't say something.\"\n\n\nI feel as though I either need to do something sooner rather than later, but just can't bring myself to do it. If I wait too long I have no doubt they will confirm housing for a year long lease this summer along with committing to an education program (different from the ones previously discussed). However, this would be right before a birthday and before my finals, and I am hesitant to take on more stress than necessary in this already stressful time.  \n\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: How do you break up with someone who is mostly sweet but way more interested in you than I am with them? If I can't shake the thought of someone else, is my relationship over?",

I don't know how to contact her and not seem as some kind creep but this fear is just overwhelming.\n\nMy internet friend(and crush, but I'm ok with friendzone) live in abusive family(there was one situation when her father had beaten her and make death threats, and many smaller incidents). She suffer on depression and social anxiety. She is now writing matura exams and i always was hoping that she will free herself after that on studies. Few months ago she cut off all contact with me. It was in peace, she had written me that she will always think about me good and she feel uncomfortable with our contact because of high introvercy. I had written bechelor paper few weeks ago and thought that maybe it would be good occasion to renew contact so I told her about it by her brother. She reacted with anger. It was quite unexpected for me, because this brother told me that few weeks from that moment she told him that she will someday for certain renew this contact. I feel completely helpless, all the time I'm overthinking what she written to me, that she is very stressed about living high school, that she would rather die than leave it(i hope it was just stupid talking, but she had 2 suecidal attempts so I'm just worry), that she may stay in this sick home for many years, that she won't go on therapy and end up in relationship with abusive partner(i know women who have abusive fathers more likely end up with abusive partners) and i don't even know if everything is alright with her. Maybe I'm overreacting but i still remember when she was writing about suecidal thoughts and abuse she survived, and i will probably long time more worry about her. I have no way to contact her, my psychiatrist told me if i will be stronger she will help me with find this contact someway, but I'm afraid it will only make her angry, or make her thought I'm some creep or stalker. But I'm so badly worry about her, just one message from her that everything is ok would probably calm me very much. We were knowing each other almost three years, talked really hard topics, i was always supporting her, and make her feel as comfortable as I can, but suddenly she just ended it all in time i know she will have difficulties to go through and i can't even help her anyway. I feel so badly helpless.",

I still think about her a lot, but i dont really miss her, and i dont want her back or anything, cause things in the relationship had become a bit bad. \n\nBut whats killing me is the jealousy. The thought of her flirting, kissing and having sex with other guys, the thought of her in a relationship with somebody else, just completely crushes me (Its just me imaging it, i dont know what shes up to)\n\nI dont want her, but i hate to think about her with somebody else.

        "text": "I have friends/family on this app so I wanna keep this anonymous. Hence the alt profile. I’ve sat on actually posting this for a couple days but so I hope this is a decent idea. \n\nI have a best friend named Danielle. We have been really close since early our early - mid teens. She’s probably the most important relationship in my life. We have a bigger friend group overall, and to them it was only a matter of time before something happened (they’ve asked me about it before and I’ve just dismissed it)\n\nLo and behold, we slept together awhile ago and continue to. We are very private with each other and no one really knows anything about us together. We’ve been in the process of trying to figure out what we’re doing in general as of now we’re in a very confusing spot, but we have great communication and we both very much love each other so we aren’t stressing too much. We have each other’s back. \n\nShe told her girl-friend that we had been sleeping together, and she was happy for us. Apparently too happy, because she told our other friend, who was dating a guy in the group. Hence, how it got out. \n\nWe both weren’t happy it got out, but figured whatever because it would eventually and it’s nice to have to just get it over with. \n\nApparently, because they thought it was funny, made a bet about her and I hooking up months ago. Everyone was in on it. They told us, and they thought we would take it well, but we didn’t. \n\nI will say, the guys have mentioned that they should, but I thought it was a joke or something you say in passing, did not think they were serious because who the fuck does that. \n\nThey mentioned I “knew” and Danielle confronted me about it, and I said technically I did, but I 100% thought it was a joke. She said she wishes I told her still because we tell each other everything and this has become extremely uncomfortable for her now. \n\nI said I was upset too and I’m on her side of all this because it isn’t fair to us. We don’t know what we’re even doing with each other. Now she also feels embarrassed and betrayed. Which at the end of the day, is my main focus. The girl is struggling and the rest of it, I don’t care about it if I’m being honest. \n\nLike I said, she has been visibly affected by it and I felt like it’s made her and I’s relationship temporarily worse while also creating a weird tension in our overall group. I reached out the next day again the next day and just told her I was thinking about her and I love you. She sent back “You always do, I love you too :)” and out of fucking nowhere I started crying a little bit. \n\nAll I wanna do is comfort her and fix this, but I don’t even know what to do specifically. This is such a weird situation. I feel like I’m suppose to have the answers to this as the guy, but I don’t. \n\nI’m willing to hear all thoughts/opinions/advice/ and generally, just anything. \n\nThank you guys. \n\nTLDR - Best friend and I slept together after years of being close, it got back to our group and they revealed they made a bet on it, and threw me under the bus claiming I knew, and now my best friend is uncomfortable and kind of distant. How do I fix this?",

I (21f) have had depression and schizophrenia since I was 10 and my aunt (50F) suffers from the same thing. Recently both me and my aunt have gotten worse, I have been recently diagnosed with MDD and suffering from suicidal ideation and my aunt got recently admitted to a psychiatric hospital   because she has been hearing and seeing things more than she usually does and my mom was the one who took her to the hospital. Me and my mom (48F) have been talking daily for the past few months so I’ve been up-to-date on my aunt’s situation and was aware she was admitted. \n\nWhat ensued the argument was the day after she got admitted, my mom called me (as she usually does) but I wasn’t able to get to the phone due to my BF (21M) coming home for lunch and us talking about his day at work. When he left, I completely forgot that I heard my phone ring. Later that night my mom sent me a text saying I don’t care about her and that I should be ashamed and embarrassed about not talking to her. I texted her that I genuinely forgot my phone rang and tried to reassure her but she texted me an upset reply that I never have her back when she needs me, combined with sarcasm that I couldn’t have really forgotten. \n\nSince that day, I have felt worthless. She tried calling me the day after our argument, I didn’t pick up (I felt that if I answered, I was going to have a panic attack), and she texted me “busy again??” And I just broke down afterwards.\n\nIt’s been 2 weeks since then and she called me 2 times today and sent texts with apologies but I’m not sure how to feel about it. I want to accept her apology (I still love my mom regardless) but I’m not sure how to go about it? Even though both me and my aunt have recently gotten worse, it genuinely felt like she pushed my issues aside when she said those things. I know she would never say those things to my aunt (especially over forgetting to pick up a phone call) but when it comes to me, it feels like she doesn’t care about how her words affect me. Can someone help me understand how I should respond?\n\nTLDR: I want to repair my relationship with my mom but I’m not sure about how I should feel when she treats me poorly.",

I got a text yesterday from my really close friend of 8+ years saying that he can no longer make it because he is going to his girlfriend's best friends boyfriend's cottage instead. I had also messaged the girlfriend to invite her earlier this month and she ignored my message ( now I see why). He told me he did not want to go and that the only reason he was is because him and his GF had cancelled on this friend 4 other times and they were scared they would not be invited by this group of friend ever again if they did not go. He said he would make it up to me but offered no concrete plans of when to see me and sort of insinuated I should make time to see him for him to make it up to me ( ex: when are you downtown we can meet up then or I am at x place all the time we can meet around there). Regardless I told him potentially Thursday I could drive down to see him. I am super sad, really hurt and sort of offended and tbh I am not sure you can makeup missing your close friends birthday because you want to attend some random party which has already gone down 4 other times. He said he felt bad but I am not sure how I went from priority one to last place when he also admitted these plans were made AFTER my invitation went out and they agreed to come. Today I woke up and was honestly even more upset after it all sunk in and I just texted him that I am super busy this week and my schedule is full for this week. Do I have a right to be upset and send such cold messages or am I being entitled?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: my really close friend of 8+ years agreed to plans for my birthday and cancelled on me to attend his girlfriends friends boyfriends cottage along with his gf.

Sometimes my wife hears me talking in my sleep and wakes me up. I never tell her about what my nightmares were about.\n\nSome days I get so close to telling her, but I can never get the words out of my throat. I hate myself for this. I will never forgive myself.

It was the first day of the trip and i saw my grandma after so many months. We went in the car and started driving home. My cousin who was 9 at the time, For some odd reason my family lets there young kids wear crop tops and teenage clothes you see typically. My cousin was wearing stuff like that and my grandma legit asks me “do you think your cousin looks sexy” Something like that. I legit felt uncomfortable and awkward. I wanted to say “no” but if i said that then i would be seen as rude and when i did say no she would make me feel guilty kinda cuz she would say “oh so she isn’t sexy?” and i didn’t wanna sound like i’m insulting my cousin but if i said “yes” I would be seen as a creepy pedophile incest and no way in hell will i say that cuz she’s my young cousin why tf would i see her that way. She could get uncomfortable too if i said “yes”. I legit told my grandma that she is litterally my cousin i don’t think she is sexy why would i think of that as my family member especially a child. Idk if she knows what the word means but ben if she said another word It would still sound concerning. My grandma was just telling me how it’s ok to call someone sexy it doesn’t mean you see them as someone to date. I was 15 at the time too btw. \n\nAnother thing that happened was that my cousins friends (below 10 years old) had a crush on me and on new years they wanted me to kiss them but i’m not a fucking pedo so i had to tell them no and walk away from them My aunts were telling me to just let them kiss me and to kiss them back and telling me to stop being rude and i was like bro no They’re fucking kids i’m not gonna be accused of a pedo in the future nor am i gonna be accused of it now. Nor am i gonna kiss a fucking child like i was legit 15 years old while they were like 7-10 years old\n\ntldr: Grandma asks me (15m) if i think my cousin (9f) is sexy and cousins friends wanted to kiss me on new years but i didn’t kiss back cuz i think it’s wrong to kiss underaged kids",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I'm hoping to gain some perspective and advice on an unusual situation.\n\nOver the course of time, many of my close friends have moved away from our city including all of my girl friends, and the friends who remain are all guys who are busy with work/school or are people who I love but wouldn't necessarily spend a lot of 1:1 time with. I'm an extreme extrovert and very much miss the camaraderie of the full friend group from college, and make every effort possible to get together with my friends, but I do get lonely and spend a lot of social time on my own (I go to my favorite local bar 1-2 times a week), as my boyfriend \"Dan\" is an introvert and doesn't like going out much. Conversely, while Dan has lost friends to moves, many of his buddies still live in the area and we see them fairly frequently, which is great because they're always so much fun and I really do love them a lot. This is all to say that I'm desperate for local friendship and connections beyond my strapped-for-time friends, fellow bar regulars, and Dan's friends.\n\nAs we still live in our college town, we've gone to his friend Peter's family's tailgate since we started dating. Everyone brings whoever they want, it's a great mix of people, and it's always a blast. This past year at one of the tailgates I was introduced to someone Peter's mom knows, Mike (30M). We immediately clicked and have seen each other at tailgates and have gone out a few times for drinks. I actually feel as though I'm developing a friendship connection I've been missing for a while, but Dan seems to not be as happy for me as I'd expect. He says he doesn't like Mike, despite the fact Mike apparently also had a few classes with my boyfriend in college and as far as I'm aware they got along decently enough. He's mentioned once or twice that he didn't like the way Mike looked at me when we first met. I think this is ridiculous, as Mike has never been anything other than friendly and kind to me or to Dan. I'm very aware of how I'm perceived by interested men, and he's never given me that vibe at all.\n\nNow most of you are going to tell me that Dan's jealous, but for full context, Dan and I've been dating for four years and have been in a happy, healthy open ENM relationship for two. I see other people, he sees other people, there isn't a hint of jealousy or negative feelings about our arrangement. Very few people outside our relationship know and we prefer to keep it that way- we don't sleep with friends, exes, or coworkers, nor do we go out on local dates with the people we see. Dan has no problems with me spending time with my male friends alone nor has he ever had problems with it, including one friend I hooked up with in college who I'm still great friends with today. We've even discussed bringing someone else into the relationship romantically. Jealousy/possessiveness/fear of losing me is not the problem, but he's unable to articulate anything beyond \"I just don't like the guy\".\n\nThe Mike issue came up again this weekend and I'm afraid it's grating on my last nerve. Dan and I were talking about an upcoming St. Patrick's Day parade. We were originally going with his friend and his wife, but they had to back out at the last minute, none of my guy friends are able to make it or are performing in the parade, and we're waiting to hear back from my best friend and her boyfriend about staying the weekend with us but it's sounding unlikely. Dan mentioned that he didn't really want to go if my bff didn't end up joining us, and I said it was fine and listed off a few possible people I could tag along with, mainly other bar regulars and Mike. As soon as I mentioned Mike, Dan immediately changed his tune and said he'd go with me if it was important to me, and that he didn't want me alone with Mike. I asked about it and we got into a whole new round of \"why not/I don't like him/why not/I don't like how he looks at you/I'm friends with him and he's a nice guy, why don't you like him/I just don't\". At this point I dropped it, but Dan's resistance to my friendship with this one particular person is odd. I've stressed to him that I'm not interested in anything with Mike, and honestly I don't believe Mike is interested in me either, but he won't budge and I'm worried that bringing it up again will seem suspicious. Mike kindly picked up my ticket for an afterparty at the bar so I'll definitely be seeing him then, and I'm worried about Dan's reaction to \"handing me off\" afterwards, as he's definitely not going to the party. If anyone has any advice or thoughts, or a different way to approach this conversation, that would be really helpful.\n\nTl;dr. Lonely gf makes new friend but bf doesn’t like new friend for very nebulous reasons that aren’t really reasons at all and have nothing to do with the friend being a man.",

        "text": "Bear with me since this is my first Reddit post. I come from an orthodox religious family. They are very strict and controlling. \nWhen I met my ex I was just coming out of a depression, trying to heal. I fell for him because he’s just so genuine and kind. I couldn’t open up to anyone before him, I’ve never been able to trust. \nHe’s just the kindest most genuine person. \nWe dated for about a year, and coming from a sheltered family I never dated anyone before him. \nHe was my first kiss and everything. We went everywhere together, snuck around everywhere. Shared every single moment together. If we weren’t together in person, we’d be on call. We were so open with each other and really helped each other grow. I feel like we’ve become better people from it.\nWhen we dated, I brought up conversion and we talked a lot about where we were headed.\nAfter last year, It became apparent to me that my family will never accept him. I could be disowned, if not shunned. We had to hide our relationship the entire time. \nAs well as I am also connected to my religion and faith. And I wouldn’t want to push that on him. \nI want to raise my future kids with my faith and two separate religions cause confusion.\nSo I decided that I can’t keep leading this relationship on when I can’t marry him. \nAfter the breakup we would still call everyday. He asked to get back together and I told him he knows we can’t no matter how much I wish. \nIt’s been a little over three months since the breakup. \nThese past two weeks he’s been distant, leaving me on read, ignoring my messages. That’s when the breakup really started to hit me.\nI haven’t been able to eat, I haven’t been able to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night shaking. Dreaming of him. \nRecently, I started going through all the ways we could possibly be together in my head, imagining a future with him. \nGetting false hope.\nI asked him to meet up yesterday and we had a long conversation. He admitted he’s never been a religious person and wouldn’t want to raise a Jewish family. \nI told him I’d give up my faith and family. He said what if I did and then we broke up? I’d have nothing. And he’s right. Yet being with him felt so comforting, holding him in my arms and just being around him yesterday. \n\nI later asked if he still has feelings for me. He told me he cant lie to me and say he does, but he still has respect for me as a person and as a best friend. It just pains me so much. A month ago he was still not over me. How could he just forget his feelings so fast? \nI feel so disposable when he is irreplaceable to me.\nAnd im not trying to blame him for moving on, I just can’t help feeling like I wasn’t enough.  \n\nI dont want to live without him, everything feels meaningless. I have other hobbies, a shit ton of them. Yet I dont feel any motivation to do them, and havent since the breakup. It hurts so much knowing I’d do anything for him, give up everything. But it will never be. I can’t even open up to my family.\nI know it sounds drastic but I lost my will to live. \nI don’t know how to move on when he’s my whole world. When he’s the only thing I want to live for. I wish there was someway we could make it work. \nI could use some advice on how to deal with a breakup. Where do I go from here when I’m stuck living in the past?\n\nTLDR: My bf and I had to breakup because of religion and I can’t move on.",

        "text": "To be clear right of the bat, I'm super thrilled about it, and I have immense confidence in our compatibility and future. Our conflict resolution styles are both very compassionate and mature, I've never been as comfortable living with anyone as I am with them, we've already mostly merged our finances and are both quite financially responsible. We've been talking about marriage for a few months now and the only surprise is that they've been more eager to get married than I expected, as it was never something they wanted before we met. \n\nWe're crazy about each other, our families are crazy about each other, we're compatible in ways that seem like a genuine statistical anomaly. I never expected to find someone that hit literally every box of what I want in a partner the way they do. \n\nThe small insecurity I have is that I'm... young. It's amplified by the fact that I became financially independent at 20, started my PhD at 21, the majority of my friends are in their mid 30s and the only people close to my age that I know are other second-year PhD students in my department. And yet, I'll be the first of my friends to get married. \n\n23 is not a weird age to get married, yeah? It's really young for academic scientists which are the circles I run in but I'm pretty sure it's normal otherwise. Both sets of our parents are totally on board considering I'm older than all of them were when they got married and they've got strong marriages that have been going on for 30++ years. None of our friends were surprised to hear of our engagement and they were all excited for us. \n\nIt's all green flags, basically. I don't feel there are any 'young single person' experiences I haven't had that I'm missing out on, I'm totally satisfied with the sum of my dating experiences, I'm completely convinced that I've found the most logically and emotionally compatible human to me maybe in the whole world, and considering how completely stupid I'd have to be to lose them over insecurities about my age, nothing about this is really going to change my mind. I guess I just want reassurance that I'm not being a stupid kid. It's hard not to feel that way about a lot of things when I'm the youngest person I interact with on a daily basis.\n\ntl;dr Really great relationship. I'm 23, my fiancé just turned 30, I'm a little insecure about my age re:marriage because all of my friends are in their 30s and still unmarried. Could use some reassurance :)",

We do not really have any similar interests and after few months of different schedules etc. I realised that we want different things from life, long term.\n\n  \nWe just weren't as emotionally connected as we used to be, and I started to feel like we were more like friends than romantic partners. I think the new environment and experiences we were having contributed to this shift. It was really hard to make the decision to break up, but I ultimately felt like it was best for both of us to go our separate ways.    \n\n\nHowever, despite the breakup, my ex-girlfriend and I are still living together because **neither of us can afford to move out**. We have separate rooms and for the most part, things are okay. However, every few hours she becomes very sad, cries and wants me to come talk to her. I've set boundaries that we shouldn't be physical, but talking felt okay. It's only been 4 days since the breakup, so everything is still very fresh, and I'm not sure how to navigate this situation. Despite the difficulties, I still care for her and want to make this as easy as possible for both of us. \n\nAnybody who has been in a similar situation and could help me how to solve this dilemma?  \nTLDR: I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two years because we grew apart after changing schools. Despite the breakup, we still live together because we can't afford to move out. She gets very sad and cries every few hours, and wants to talk to me, but I've set boundaries that we shouldn't be physical.

She’s beyond my leagues of success. As much as I try to love myself I know for a fact this woman deserves much more out of life than me.\n\nOur relationship started about 9 months ago and it started off good. I pursued her hard, I wasn’t really into her but she had an amazing personality and I figured she would grow on me and she did for a while. \n\nWell a few months ago I kind of started falling out of love and wishing I had stayed single. This makes me a terrible person but I realized I miss the freedom of being single. \n\nIt’s been boiling since then and I tried to break up with her in February. She said I lied about all my feelings for her, that I never loved her, that I gave her false hope. So I stayed out of the guilt I felt and in hopes it would get better.\n\nSince that moment in February, her grandmother has passed away which has been extremely rough on her. Another extremely close relative of hers has went to jail. It’s all hitting her super hard.\n\nI tried to leave again recently and she told me that I used her, that I gave her false hope. She told me I never loved her and to not lie to the next person. She said I never should’ve gotten into a relationship with her in the first place.\n\nI want OUT. I love this woman but I’m not in love with her anymore.\n\nAm I being manipulated? What do I do? Do I stay and just be unhappy or do I leave and hurt her even more. \n\nI’m so overwhelmed.\n\nTL;DR! - My girlfriend won’t let me break up with her and I feel like I’m being manipulated.",

        "text": "This will be a lengthy post, so tag along for the ride! I (24M) dated my ex (23F) for 10 months, 7 months were long distance. The first 4 months was amazing and thought about proposing and was going to start planning on when and how, since it would be further down the road so it could be even more planned and special. I love her family so much and wanted that so bad, it was nothing of a family that I have experienced before in a relationship. Then problems started to hit, so I held back to analyze more of the situation before making this huge commitment.\n    Minor problems became big problems. It started with not talking to her enough (I work 10 hour days and right when I get off work I will talk to her until I go to bed, I like to watch 1 hour of TV to decompress sometime in that duration). It came to her being upset of not texting her enough at work. I couldn’t like ANY girls pictures my age, not even cousins or girls wedding pictures/family pictures that are from highschool or college, etc. My location, Snapchat score, Facebook “active” was stalked pretty much nonstop. It came to the point that I could not be trusted. Mind you that I have NEVER cheated at all in my life, never gave a reason for her to not trust me. It’s a terrible feeling as I have been cheated on 3 times already, I would not want to give anyone that type of feeling.\n    As I am not perfect, she is not the only one to blame for all of the problems. It is definitely shared, we have argued a lot regarding my faults of being upset easily and not showing enough emotion within situations. Comments that have been said, from both parties that should have not been said. There were arguments that would last until 2am, I wake up at 4:40 for work, it was draining and exhausting. I did it because I loved her and wanted her.\n    That had a factor to do as well as a financial factor. She didn’t have a job when we started dating, which was fine, she had a goal and strived to get a position in realty. That switched to something else, then again and again. She was perfectly fine staying at home to do nothing, not search for work and not advance in a path of a job she would love. I helped create a resume for her and helped make an account on indeed/other job apps and telling her jobs that she was interested in that were open to apply. There was nothing, she would sleep till 12pm regularly. Which is why she could argue past 2am. My job pays well, but not enough to live for more than just ourselves unless her and I wanted to go paycheck to paycheck and make zero growth on getting a house, paying off debt, etc.\n    I wanted it to work because I loved her and her family, I wanted to have something like that for the rest of my life because family is everything and now I have that with a beautiful girl. It came down to that I loved her family more than I loved her. My love was fading away with her and I cannot marry someone just to have their family. Financially was not driven to work or try to provide for a future family. So I broke things off. I truly miss her and I think I made a huge mistake in that process because I lost a friend and a family of friends that I grew with. So was it right to break things off? Will I be be better off? Will I find a family like that again with another relationship?\n\nTl:dr; Did I make the wrong mistake of breaking things off",

At the start of the relationship we had banter and would poke light-hearted fun at each other for things but recently I feel as though he has joked so much that its how he really feels. Growing up I had an eating disorder, leaving me with body dysmorphia after recovery and it still effects me to this day, and he knows this. I am 55kg, 5'3, more of an athletic build and I would label myself as an average weight, but I would say almost every day he makes fat jokes, if i miss the gym he calls me lazy, says i'm \"bulking\" (to poke at me gaining weight) and generally just makes fun of my  physical appearance. When I bring things up to him, he says I'm sensitive and I shouldn't take it to heart, but it really does hurt my feelings and my self image? I'm worried that I am really being too sensitive and that he might leave me because of this. Am I being too sensitive? Is it normal for partners to constantly poke fun at your insecurities?\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend makes fun of physical appearance time and time again, says I'm too sensitive",

        "text": "My boyfriend (20m) is in school and is doing much, much better than I did when I was in undergrad. To sum it up in not too much detail, he works extremely hard and has received acceptances to several very prestigious programs in his field of study, which also opens up further impressive opportunities, as well as pays large stipends (over $20k a year). His professors are saying he is likely to be accepted to top graduate schools. The work he is doing is so important and impressive and he is also extremely intelligent. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there’s me. 22F, very mediocre and have done nothing with my life. I graduated with my degree and have a job but it’s nothing meaningful. I never did anything special in undergrad. I only make $43k a year. I’m never going to do anything special. I’m stupid, I never stood out in any way and I’m never going to. I feel like a worthless, useless deadbeat next to him and I question why he even puts up with me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for and proud of him and he deserves all the success he has. But at the same time, it makes me feel like shit about myself and I don’t know what to do.\n\n\n\ntldr: Younger boyfriend is way more successful than I am and it makes me feel pathetic and insecure and worthless",

But i got really seek with high fewer so we could not meet during the week end but we talked about seeing each other today if i feelt better. \n\n All this time we chatted a lot and she always was close and affectionate. But apparently for no reason at all yesterday and today she turned really cold didn't wanted to meet she just said she was really busy when i asked with what she just repited her self. She didn't asked how i was feeling or anything just answered my texts coldly. \n\nI know we basically have nothing but it looked like there was a begging of something. She was just out of a short relationship same for me and i just can't add up the reason of her distancing all the sudden. \n\nShould I even ask ?\n\nTL;dr: i spend last week having sex and dating with an old school college but after the weekend she seems no longer interested",

        "text": "I have known my wife for years, we are coming up to around 6 years now.  We met in High School and became friends, and eventually fell in love.  We spent every day together in high school, and when she went to college I would drive to visit her every week.  We kept in touch through the thick and thin, and a couple of years ago we got married.  Everything has been perfect since we got married.  We are happy together and things are going so well.  She is the best thing that ever happened to me.  I have no idea where I would be without her.  I will never forgive myself for betraying her.\n\nOne day a few years ago in college, before we were married or engaged, but still while we were in a relationship, I cheated on her.  It was a random unplanned spur of the moment kind of thing, and I have hated myself for it ever since.  I haven't cheated on her since then or ever felt the urge to, but it doesn't matter.  I still cheated.\n\nSometimes when she looks at me lovingly and holds me, or when she brightens up my day, I feel the guilt in the back of my mind.  I don't think she would have gotten married to me if she knew what I had done.\n\nSometimes I even have nightmares a lot about when I cheated.  Sometimes my wife hears me talking in my sleep and wakes me up.  I never tell her about what my nightmares were about.\n\nSome days I get so close to telling her, but I can never get the words out of my throat.  I hate myself for this.  I will never forgive myself.  She deserves someone better than me.\n\nTLDR: I met my sweetheart 6 years ago, and we got married 2 years ago.  Everything is going great.  I am wracked with guilt because one day three-ish years ago, I cheated on her.",

I'm upset that this means I'm probably going to be infected repeatedly when she inevitably catches Covid at work. Neither of us have been infected yet and neither of us have any conditions making \"high risk\"\n\nI am very well-versed with peer reviewed studies and the continually mounting evidence that each Covid infection causes cumulative damage, greatly increasing the risk of negative cardiovascular, neurological, and other serious outcomes. I really do not want to lose my good health and would not be able to do my job or support us financially if I had long Covid.\n\nWe've discussed this issue at length and she is not willing to change careers so that she's able to work remotely. My options appear to be to leave her, which means ending a 9 year relationship and selling our house, or stay put and accept that my health, and probably livelihood, are going to be destroyed.\n\nTL;DR: Partner not masking at work. I don't want to get Covid repeatedly. Should we break up?",

        "text": "\n\nA little context: Me (15M) and my friend (15FTM, henceforth referred to as ‘Jake’) are in our first year of high school and have known each other since grade. In 7th grade, Jake told me he liked me and we entered into a ‘relationship’ until the middle of 8th, when we amicably split but remained on good terms. We’ve been just friends ever since.\n\nMain Events: A few days ago, Jake found out that the feelings he had for his crush were not mutual. He was pretty shaken up, so I did my best to be a good friend and help him through it. I brought him his favorite candy and tried to support him, but as we were leaving class he told me he needed a hug. I answered his request and we held the hug for a good few seconds, before making our way to our separate classes. I thought about it the whole day, but had mostly disregarded it by the time school was done.\n\nAfter school was done, I was at home playing video games when Jake texted me, asking if I could go to the school musical with him. I agreed, and came back to school to watch it with him. At first we were just chilling together, but by the end of our time at school we’d hugged again once, and he’d put his head on my shoulder several times. His melancholy demeanor from earlier had mostly gone away, and had initiated all but one of the head-shoulder-rests. After the play, we went to dinner together and shared a pizza before my mom drove him home as he rested his head on my shoulder one last time. Before he entered his house, he gave me one last hug.\n\nIn the following days, I’ve found myself thinking about Jake more and more, and I think I’m starting to have a crush on him. I don’t really want to tell him because of the history between us, and because of what happened with his previous crush. What should I do?\n\nTLDR, friend/ex is starting to get more physically close to me, I’m starting to get a crush on them and I don’t know what to to.",

        "text": "My boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) have been dating for a little over 4 years. We get along really well and we were best friends for a couple years before we started dating. We have the same sense of humor, the same taste in music, same interests, same movie and tv show taste, etc. Every time we see each other, it just feels natural. We respect each other greatly and are never toxic or rude to the other, we don't even go as far as yelling, let alone anything else. Recently, I've hit a rough patch with my mental health. It took both of us by surprise, and neither of us knew how to handle the situation. I ended up moving home for a few months to get my health, therapy, and medication squared away. I'm finally feeling better, but now I feel like I've been analyzing every part of my life. I have been for the last half a year or so, since that's when my life exploded. \n\nI started noticing the differences between us. These differences aren't things that need to be tackled right now, which is why I think we've ignored them for this long. The largest difference is that I don't want kids, he very much does. I've told him that, of course, I may end up wanting kids, but I very much don't right now. He's said multiple times how all he wants is to be a good dad. I've told him multiple times that there's a large chance I won't want kids. He always says the same thing, \"we'll cross that bridge when we get to it\". I don't want to get married and end up getting divorced over the kid situation. \n\nI'm also a huge activist about my passions (women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, black lives matter, etc.) and very left leaning, while he's is pretty neutral. This isn't the entire problem, I don't mind if he doesn't share the same intensity for these things as I do. He doesn't like when I advocate these things in front of his friends though. A lot of his friends are right leaning, he isn't (I don't think). His friends make jokes about racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. all of which they pass off as being \"dark humor\". I don't find it funny at all,  but I try to be a good sport. We've had multiple conversations about what his friends talk about, and I've always told him \"if they say anything derogatory toward me or if they say a joke like that to me, I'm not going to just take it,\". He'll tell me to not make a scene. I've always hated when he'd say that to me. He knows my stance on things, and he's said he shares the same views. As soon ass we leave the privacy of just the 2 of us, it seems like he disregards the conversations all together. He won't say anything offensive, but he won't say anything to back up his stance. I've overheard multiple conversations of his friends making jokes about women's bodies, political issues, etc. It upsets me a lot. Especially, when he says he disagrees with the stuff they say. If he does then why would he just sit there and let it happen? I always feel like the odd one out. When I defend myself or defend whatever they're attacking, they'll think it's funny. \n\nWe're also, relatively, sexually incompatible. I have a very low sex drive and sexual trauma, he has a high sex drive. This has always been an issue that's brought up. I'll always feel guilty for turning him down, and he'll always feel guilty for asking in the first place. He's said that it isn't an issue for him, but recently he brought it up in an argument/ break down about our relationship. He told me it was getting to him. I don't think I'll ever be able to provide what he needs, especially the amount that he wants. It comes up again and again, I'm honestly sick of it. It keeps leaving both of us upset and I hate it. \n\nHe also hasn't handled my recent mental break well. I'm not at all blaming him for this, we're so young and he hasn't had to think about this kind of stuff before. I've struggled with mental illnesses since I was 11. I've had to become educated about it and emotionally mature before most should. I understand that he hasn't been exposed to an episode of this degree before, so how should he be expected to handle it? It really drove a wedge in between us though. He didn't know how to support me, and I wasn't well enough to communicate healthily. This became even worse when I had to move back home. We didn't really talk a lot. It's been hard.\n\nI understand that we're still young and have a lot of room to grow, but I'm trying to figure out my life and what I want it to be. This has all been so heavy on my mind and makes me feel like a horrible person for even questioning things. I care so much for him and I love him. Logically, I know that we probably won't work in the long run, but emotionally it hurts so much to think about. I don't really know what to do with all of this right now. I'm only in the early stages of recovery, so I don't know if I should bring up these concerns to him. Idk, I just need some guidance.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been going through a rough patch that has made me start to question things in our relationship. We differ in wanting children, political/passion views, sexual compatibility, and handling mental health. We differ greatly when it comes to larger things, but we're great with everyday interaction/ small things. I'm not sure what to do in this scenario. Should I bring up these concerns to him sooner rather than later? I'm recovering from a major depressive episode, so I don't know how to handle this situation.",

        "text": "I (29F) feel wrecked and I could use some encouragement. (Ex is also 29F.)\n\nI’d only had a few relationships before this, all of them bad in one way or another, one of them actively abusive, and none of them made it past 1.5 years. This last one was the first healthy, safe relationship I’ve ever had, and it meant a lot to me. \n\nWe broke up at ~1 year. The breakup came as no surprise. We’d had several discussions about a potential lifestyle incompatibility. Without getting too specific, I have a high-powered career that involves a lot of networking, while my ex grew up very impoverished and felt different to everyone else in my social/professional circle. We had good communication about this. She was honest with me that she was insecure about it. She told me I personally never made her feel pressured or insufficient, but she worried my friends wouldn’t like her, and she felt out of place at the couple of networking events we attended. I reassured her I loved her for who she was, and I was also honest that it would probably be important for the long-term health of any relationship I’m in for my partner to be comfortable with my career and the networking it involves. Ultimately, when we broke up, she told me that that would never be her, and that she couldn’t relieve the pressure her own insecurity was putting on her. \n\nI am heartbroken. Rationally, I understand that she deserves better than to feel insecure and uncomfortable in a relationship, and I would also ultimately be uncomfortable with an uncomfortable partner. I have no desire to pressure or change her. I have no desire to give up parts of myself to accommodate her. Irrationally, I’m in agony. She is so special to me, so kind, emotionally deep, intellectually stimulating, funny, adventurous, refreshingly honest, respectful, beautiful in every way. It saddens me that this one problem destroyed the entire relationship. I’m finding myself fixating on incredibly trivial details (boohoo, I’ll never find those same beautiful hazel eyes), as well as legitimate fears (what if I really never do find someone who’s so exciting *and* so mature again?). \n\nHow do I get my head out of my heart, and my heart out of its spiral? No matter how thoroughly I rationalize to myself, I can’t stop feeling devastated. \n\ntl;dr: Relationship ended because of understandable incompatibility, but my broken heart doesn’t understand anything and is making me crazy.

        "text": " \n\nI'll give you a TON of context.\n\nMet this cool dude through a mutual friend, initially found him quite cute - but had a BF at the time. Regardless, he was also very funny, quirky, charming and friendly, good banter, etc. We exchanged social medias (me initiating this) at our first meeting, when it was me, him, and mutual friend.\n\nWe began talking over that SM if not daily, at least every other day, sometimes morning until night intermittently / sporadically. At one point, I had broken up with BF - who by this point had began demonstrating selfishness, lack of interest in me, only interest in one thing and only wanting to see me late at night....a tale as old as time.\n\nSo there I was, talking daily - long and interesting, genuine convos with a very sweet and attractive guy. And newly single.\n\nWe arrange - around like, a month after having initially met. Coffee, art gallery - back to my abode. FYI - we read a book together, chilled, laughed, closed mouth kissing, spooning, and light petting. We made soup too.\n\nI won't lie to you - I'm fast. I'm a fast gal. I like sex, be offended some of you, I suppose. I would have been down if it HAD been on the table - just so you are aware. He was warm, and his shirt DID come off. It was glorious. Really beautiful guy. We're both having a grand old spoon and joking about how we're not even paying attention to whatever BS we were watching in the background.\n\nAnyways - so established a new romantic context. Next time we meet is like a week or so later and its coffee and minigolfing. Again, he's cute, quirky, and whatever, and I want him and I'm DOWN - you get the point. Back to mine for some spooning and whatever. No sexual stuff whatsoever. I was literally sitting on his lap - etc. What I'm trying to convey is that I am VERY VERY DOWN and publicly post to my social medias about being fast - a HARLOT, even.\n\nNothing sexytime-wise occurs. Regardless a nice day - I wonder if it maybe just takes him some time to warm up to people, since he was initiating light pecks / cuddling / touching a lot more than last time. He leaves after a few hours - goodbye, had a great time, will miss you, etc etc etc.\n\n**So, that was almost a week ago now. He has yet to contact me**.\n\nNo DMs. Nothing. Weird, right?\n\nWhich adds to my suspicion and what I've been telling my friends - I turned him off by being TOO eager and too pushy - in fact, meeting the 2nd time around was my idea, even. Maybe it was that, and the double texting. Lmao. Lesson Learned. Too thirsty.\n\nI get it 100%. You can't blame someone for.... being just kinda not into you - and I've accepted that. To my knowledge everything was consensual and I didn't think I had crossed a line. I suspect I was just a little bit confused, too excited, and I took the compliments a little too to-heart. No harm done - not every guy who thinks you're cute is gonna want to pursue you IRL, not every guy is gonna do you or date you and people have preferences, people are allowed to say 'actually, this ain't for me' etc etc. That's not the issue. I'm not offended by that at all.\n\n**NOW!, dear council**....What is odd is that **he likes my IG posts almost straight away** \\- sometimes mere minutes(?), or instantly almost, and he views every. single. IG. story (I post a ton of funny shit / selfies / rambles, etc, sometimes my story can be like 30 images long) again almost MINUTES after they're posted.\n\nI suppose I might take from this that he still finds me.... funny, interesting, and etc. I would certainly hope so. Do you guys think this means a sort of 'we don't work out romantically, but you're still funny asf' sort of thing? I'd ask my actual pals, but they just keep asking me if im SUUURE he's not GAY? lmao. Of course I still wanna be friends with the guy. I'm just not sure what to do.\n\ntl;dr: met a guy, came on very strong, he got obv very turned off.... but still seems to stan me on social media? what do?",

He had gotten out of a 2 year long relationship and i had gotten out of a 1 year long relationship. Both of which ended around the same time, and 2 months after my bf and I jumped into the relationship. He brought up the break because he feels like we moved too fast and he isn’t ready to be in a relationship because he isn’t healed from the trauma his ex did to him and he feels like he’s losing himself. When we spoke about it I understand where he was coming from and it made me realize I’m not ready to be in one either. considering we only had 2 months after our long relationships we started dating one another, we don’t think that we had time to fully heal. Now I don’t want advice on our relationship so please be nice and don’t speculate things. I just want to advice on how long is too long for a break. And should we continue to speak while on this break or just cut communication completely? And also should he be the one to tell me when he’s ready since he brought up taking a break first. Or when I feel like I’m ready should I tell him? If me and him cut communication completely I don’t know how to go about breaking the ice if that makes sense.  \n\n\nTLDR; Long story short, I want advice on taking a break with my boyfriend.",

All great friends. There was some joking on the text chain before the trip from one of the guys about one of the beaches (we were going to Kauai) being a nude beach, and that we should stop by, haha. Most people laughed it off, but my best friend and I said sure why not? Maybe let’s see what happens. \n\nAnyway fast forward to the trip, a couple people brought up the notorious nude beach again, and my friend and I said we were game. What I didn’t understand (because she didn’t say anything) is that she wasn’t as excited about it as she had been. \n\nSo, she and I went with our husbands, and when we were walking to the beach from the car she asked me if I was really planning on going topless or whatever. I said yes of course - in fact I didn’t even bring my swimsuit (I left it at the hotel). She seemed weirded out and quiet about it at that point. \n\nAnyway, I did strip down completely. It became clear that she didn’t like that but she did go topless. \n\nSince we got back home after the trip, she has mentioned that I went completely naked to some friends and even my mom, and that my husband has a prized photo of me on the beach now. Not a huge deal, but kind of weird and feels passive aggressive. \n\nI said something to her and she was super defensive. Now we aren’t speaking. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? \n\nTl;dr: I went nude at a beach and my friend seems upset about it.",

        "text": "Hey all, I'll try to keep this as concise as I can but give you all enough context.\n\n____________________\n\nMy friend and I have known each other since we were about 14 or so. We became friends in high school and had the same friend circle, some of which are still in that same circle today. We dated (high school dating, so nothing really too serious) our sophomore year, broke up about 8 months in or something, then became friends again the summer after. Since then, we've hung out in groups and solo over the next decade.\n\nFor, I want to say, 7 years of that time, she dated another friend of ours. To keep this from becoming about that huge, insane mess, he was an absolute shit head to her and despite the length of their relationship, she was apparently checked out of it for a while as he treated her awfully. He has since been mostly phased out of most of our lives.\n\nDuring this stretch as well, I dated a few different people. One of which I dated for about 3 1/2 years and nearly married. I have a pretty good history of staying friends will all of my exes, and this one is no different. Granted, we broke up only 3-4 months ago, we are both handling it very well as far as I can tell.\n\nSo in this time since my breakup, I've been spending doing some casual dating and spending a lot of time with my friends. Some of that is at people's houses, but when we go out to the bars, normally I go with the friend this post is about and maybe one or two other people. We get along really well - for the most part we always have despite some hiccups here and there (my autistic ass at one point not realizing I was being mean LMAO). It's been a blast the past few months just hanging out with her when we get the chance to go to the bars and stuff. She's honestly always been someone I've been extremely comfortable talking to.\n\nAnyways, here's the thing. In full honesty, I've seen her in a platonic since basically high school. I'm not sure what changed, maybe it was the alcohol, but one of the recent times we were out at the bar I was in the middle of just a normal conversation with her and something clicked in my brain. I kept myself from being impulsive that night, went home to sleep off the drink. Few days pass, still kind of feel like a crush started to develop. Here we are now, a number of weeks later, and for some reason I can't help but want to take her out to go do something just the two of us and show her that I am interested!\n\nWe have a couple small group things coming up (like a concert with me, her, and two mutual friends as well as a vacation trip in a few months with the same group). So, it's not like I wont have opportunities to talk to her a lot in person. Do you think this is something I should just try to ignore, or is it worth just shooting the shot? I know she has had other guys in the friend group ask her out but she hasn't had interest in them specifically. It also hasn't affected their friendship, which is nice. I don't know, I'm a pretty picky guy, but I think I'm getting a crush on her again after all these years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is it inappropriate? Bury it and just keep what's going on, or maybe try to see what she thinks? I don't want to make her feel like \"oh great, another friend wants in my pants\" or whatever, so a lot of my worry is less about rejection and more about if it'll make her feel uncomfortable.\n\n_____________________\n\n**TL;DR** A friend of 12 years and I are both relatively recently single and have been spending a decent amount of time together. While I normally think of her in a platonic way, I'm developing at least a crush and at most some feelings for her. Should I leave it well enough alone or live a little?\n\nThanks everyone!",

At about 3 months in, she started becoming really jealous and possessive of me and really self destructive.

And then she mentioned how she has intrusive thoughts about me which are negative and I felt like I just couldnt take it because throughout my life people have been so negative to me and I didnt like the thought that my girlfriend could think negatively of me even if its out of her control. She ended up blocking me, adding me back, but then I blocked her because the mind games were driving me insane. I still cant help but feel like I ditched someone who relied on me who was really suffering.\n\ntl;dr I left my girlfriend who was struggling with severe mental health issues and I cant tell if it was the right choice",

        "text": "I won’t go deep into the background if our relationship, but I experienced severe child abuse at the hands of her and her husband throughout my childhood. I attempted suicide in the third grade and still experience health complications resulting from that unsuccessful attempt. I managed to graduate at the top of my class and went on to be very successful, so I don’t seem like someone who experienced that kind of abuse. But I am. My mother and I are currently no contact because I asked her to just apologize for what I experienced, even if she didn’t mean it, just so I could try to move on and she said that she can’t apologize for things that didn’t happen. So there’s that. We are no contact and she doesn’t know that I am pregnant with her first grandchild. This is relevant because I assume that at some point she will find out, and she is not rational and will try to claw her way into our lives. \n\nThe truck. It was my abusive stepfather’s [M55ish] truck and she let my sister drive it for high school and college. My sister [F26] moved across the country and chose not to take it with her. My husband [M36] is very handy and started working on repairing the truck when my mother and I were attempting to repair our relationship. He had put probably $2,000 in parts and labor into it before she officially gave it to us. (Since, we have put in probably about $3-4k in parts and labor fixing it up - it’s really really nice now). At the time she was giving it to us, I tried to create some sort of contract to pay her back but she refused, insisting that she give it to us now and we “work it out later.” She said to come up with a fair price and that would be the deal and we could pay all at once or in payments - whatever we wanted to do. But she INSISTED we work out the terms later, and signed the title over to us with no contract, written or oral. Well, later came and she demanded an unreasonable amount of money (the entire value of the truck as it is now, which is double the value it was when she had it and was letting it rust away in the driveway). I just shut it down because it wasn’t going to be a discussion that went anywhere. Since then, I’ve told her not to contact me for any reason other than to sincerely apologize for the abuse I suffered. I feel peaceful about then I contact \n\nNow. Baby is on the way. It’s a single cab so we don’t have a reason to keep the truck now. I think I would like to just sell it and be done with it. My sister was upset that my mom was going to sell it and was glad that she gave it to us instead. She is now upset about me selling it (I offered to give it to her if she paid to ship it to her city but she says that isn’t in their budget right now) and is angry that I am considering not giving my mother any money. She cites anger about my mother giving me a few thousand dollars about 7 years ago. I won’t nickel and dime our childhoods, but she was the golden child and did not experience the same abuse I did as the scapegoat. (An illustrative example unrelated to money: My stepfather literally used to tell me, beginning from around age 6, that my sister was pure and Jesus loved her while I was evil and full of satan and would never be loved by anyone. As far as money, my mother helped my sister through college but I was kicked out on my 18th birthday. Throughout childhood, I was usually left home alone, often because it was at my request because it was the only time I was left alone, while they went shopping to buy my sister things. I just didn’t get things most of the time and wore clothes until they wore out. She had a closet of clothes with the tags still on and pitched fits if I tried to borrow them so I just didn’t. I’m not trying to harp on my sister here and our relationship is much better now but I believe this is relevant for the context of why I’m no contact and some of the nuance of the situation. I may just be the asshole here, though. Please be honest with me if I am - I just want to try to give the relevant information. I won’t make excuses for the way I was treated as a child because I was just a child, and looking back know that if CPS had ever gotten involved, things would have been very bad for my mother, an elementary school teacher. However, as an adult I want you to know that there have been a lot of emotionally charged conversations where I have been purposefully cruel to my mother to try to make her feel bad for the things that happened. That probably plays into why she feels incapable of apologizing. I am not completely innocent in the adult parts of our relationship, but do believe that the little girl who was scared an alone in my bedroom was innocent in what happened then.) \n\nTo complicate things, I’m concerned that paying her even a penny now could result in a small claims situation where she tries to say that my payment is evidence that we had an oral contract and that I am not holding up my terms of that contract. (Note: we had no contract in place, just a plan to create one later.) While I do not believe she would be successful, I live in another state now and can’t miss work or afford to hire someone to defend me. I would just rather not pay her anything and continue to not talk to her anymore. I could see her using small claims court as an opportunity to have a court defined day where I have to be home and would have to at least speak with her through a mediator, especially if she catches wind of my daughter’s existence. (I’m trying to prevent that but know it’s probably a matter of time.) Or even not just small claims. I could see her hiring an attorney to try to battle this out. This is a very legitimate concern I have, and plays into why I think it’s a bad idea to pay her. \n\nSo. Reddit. I know that the truck was hers and she may be morally entitled to some proceeds from a sale. She may even be morally entitled to some money even if I don’t sell it. (She certainly intended that I pay her someday for it.) Legally I know where I stand, but morally do I owe her anything?\n\nTLDR: my abusive mother gave me a truck with the intention that I would eventually pay for it. Legally, we had no contract and I owe her nothing, but morally I may. I’m concerned she will try to use any payment as a way back in my life and I’m also just not sure if I actually owe her anything.

My boss and I got off to a rocky start but it seems she really likes me now and can tell that I’m improving and taking my job seriously. Her husband on the other hand has seemed to have it out for me since I started working there. He’s the type that will not say anything when he’s bothered, he’ll just bottle it up until one day he blows up on you. \n\nLast week he blew up on me. I had to write 20+ anniversary cards to send out to her clients. My handwriting was really good at first but soon became sloppier because my hand was starting to hurt. He saw one of the cards I was writing and stopped me. He said “we need to have a talk” then proceeded to call all my work garbage and threaten to call my dad if I was too simpleminded to figure out how to do it to his liking (as neat as possible and centered). In that time he was belittling and berating me and telling me how sloppy and careless I was I apologized so many times I can’t count. He told me to do them all over again which I did without complaint. \n\nWhile I’m doing my first new card he comes up to me and says “this is good handwriting, why weren’t you doing this before?” Kind of as a compliment with a demeaning twist. I saw this more as a rhetorical question that he used as a put down because of how he said it and didn’t know how to respond so I just shrugged to say “I don’t know”. I didn’t feel like he wanted to hear me say sorry for the 14th time and I didn’t feel like he wanted to hear an excuse. \n\nThe next week I hear that my boss’ husband (the guy with the letters) talked to my dad and told me that he almost fired me because I didn’t answer his question. He said that if I wasn’t my dads daughter he would have fired me right then and there. I guess I’ll start answering all questions from now on even if they seem rhetorical and demeaning in nature. I don’t know, was I an asshole for not having anything to say?\n\nTLDR: boss is disrespectful and got mad at me for not knowing how to respond to his demeaning rhetorical question; claims he almost fired me.",

We reconnected a year after he moved when he came to see family, and we decided we were going to give it a try to see if I would eventually move to where he was to be with him. We were both seeing people, but agreed to break things off with those people because we both agreed we still had feelings for each other. There was absolutely no cheating on anyone on my end, as I called my then person-I-was-seeing to break things off that very evening!\n\nUpon agreeing to try things out, he went back to Cali where he proceeded to then go on a trip he PLANNED with his then gf a week after he also PLANNED to “win me back”. Fast forward, he ends up telling me the truth about being on a trip after being shady on phone calls and texts. After this, we try long-distance monogamy and it honestly is so toxic and I’m filled with so much anxiety and insecurity that we just fight on almost every phone call.\n\nWe made time to see each other once a month. Every trip is pretty awesome as we always have a great time together. Fast forward a few months, and I say I need space to think things through after he says he is feeling different. I also am at this point. There is then no label on us, although we both agree we won’t see other people. We end up seeing each other again, and I find texts that are more than friendly to an ex, as well as messages to former sex-partners and PROSTITUTES. It didn’t seem like he met up with them as there were no addresses exchanged. When I confronted him, he said it was for jerk-off sessions but admits he still has feelings for the ex he was messaging and took our “feeling differently” convo as us not being monogamous. He then said he needed time to work out his problems. \n\nAs of now, we still talk almost every night and I’m so stuck on him even though this entire experience has left me extremely insecure, depressed, negged and feeling worthless. I feel that no one understands me like him and I’ve never met someone so in tune with me sexually, intellectually and in personality. He deals with depression and BPD and said that it isn’t an excuse, but that he is going to therapy and on his meds. I guess, I am hoping he will actually change. I just want someone to talk some sense into me as I feel I have no one to share this with.\n\nTL;DR caught partner messaging people while on an ambiguous “time to figure things out”, but there is more history that indicates that he is naturally unfaithful/liar.",

Moved out on my own in December. We have a 2.5yr old daughter together and she spends weekdays with me, weekends with her mom.\n\nBaby's mom was my first real girlfriend and I only had some hookups and short term flings before dating her. After moving out, I decided to try online dating for first time, with Tinder as that was the one I heard of the most. I had a surprisingly good run, hooking up with over 10 girls. Surprising because I heard my friends complain about it all the time. I would drop off my daughter at daycare on Friday morning for her mom to pick her up in the afternoon, and either go on dates or see someone I already know over the weekend, usually meeting 2-3 women over the weekend.\n\nOne thing that I did notice is that anyone who is a bit older, or have been in a long term relationship before (so like 6-7 women), mentions that I am full of red flags or \"dangerous\". I have never followed up to ask exactly what they mean by that since I didn't want any more self hatred or self doubt than what I already have (the separation was a struggle). But the woman I slept with on Saturday night mentioned the same thing and now I can't get it out of my head.\n\nI have a well paying career I am passionate about, I treat my daughter like a princess, I have my own place in downtown of a major city and a car. I treat my dates to best of my abilities as well, with all the bells and whistles (research where to go in advance, dress well, pay for everything, hold the door open and hang up their coat for them, clean my place, wash all the blankets/sheets in advance, stock up on beverages, snacks, extra toiletry, make sure they reach orgasm etc etc).\n\nSo my question would be... what could they mean by saying I am full of red flags when they all seem to want me? All but 2 dates so far ended up with sex on first date, and all but 2 of the women I slept with wanted to meet again.\n\nI want to know because I eventually want to settle down again, have a family again, and want to start working on fixing whatever that would make me undesirable or \"dangerous\" in the eyes of my future partner.",
