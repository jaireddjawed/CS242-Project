While he was away, we shucked the corn, as instructed. However, everyone knows there's always the runt of the litter, in every living thing. So we set to shucking to find it. We eventually found it, and we measured it. 3\" by 1/2\". It was found inside another corn pod thing with another corn. Of course the original corn took all the nutrients and left the little one. So my brother then comes outside, and asks if we're done. We all say we are, and we grab the corn and head inside. We grill the corn in tinfoil, and we get ready for dinner. Me, being the second oldest, it was my turn to pass out the food. I did the chicken first, then the beans. Now it was time for the corn. I handed everyone a piece, with my brother being the last. I handed him the runt. In my family, it's considered especially disrespectful not to finish your food. So he ended up saving it for last, and when he took a bite, instantly recoiled. We all reminded him to finish everything.",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago actually, and it was inspired by another redditors post on mail men/women. \n\n I was in the kitchen cleaning it and all the dishes to help my mother out since I'm back from university(Take some of the stress of her day away for her). And spare me reddit Gods and Goddess as this is on mobile, 4am and it is long. Tl;dr at the end please forgive any grammatical errors it is 4am here.\n\n It was a nice sunny day my dogs are outside on their leads made of steel aircraft cable. My dogs are Japanese Akitas and we make their leads out of this cable because they are strong dogs and chew through everything else. These leads we make will last a few years before needing to be replaced. I had actually recently replaced all three leads the day before this happened. \n\n These leads are attached by a loop to a solid steel pole that is placed 4 feet into the ground and held in place by cement filling the hole.  The poles extend about 6 feet above the ground from there. Meaning the lead can be lifted off when the grass needs to be cut but it is too high for the loop to come off it. \n\n Two of these are in the backyard and one is in the front yard. My driveway is stone with only a small section by the door being concrete usually I stand there for packages as the stones aren't pleasant to walk on and its usually pointless to put shoes on as the regular mail lady just comes to the door.\n\n  The driveway comes up to the side of the house in such a way that you can see where Titan. But he is about 20-30 feet from said driveway and the lead ends well before the driveway, in a clearly defined circle of where he can reach. He's a big dog I mean 131 pounds big. That said he is a 131 pound lapdog (I have a picture of him somewhere trying to sit on my lap) and is extremely friendly around people and other dogs. But he especially likes people he's a really big suck.\n\nOur regular mail lady retired while I was away at university. So this was my first time dealing with the new one. \n\nBackstory over time for the story.\n\n So anyway I'm working on the dishes and my dogs are chilling in the shade of their dog houses.  I started to notice the Titan getting agitated and barking.  This is when I wondered why he was agitated.  \n\n  When, I kid you not, I hear someone in the driveway wailing on the horn. I mean full hand pressed right down as hard as possible on it. It must have been atleast a good 30 seconds before I noticed it over the tv show. (We get coyotes, so I figured one was in the field or something hence why I didn't notice the sound sooner) \n\n So I'm wondering what the hell is going on its like 10am and what could possible be going on in my driveway to need to lay on a car horn for so long. (My driveway is fairly long and big enough for school buses to turn around in). \n\n So I walk over to the door, the entire time this car horn is being held down, to figure out what the hell is going on. Turns out its the mail lady that is delivering a package for my mother. \n\n Keep in mind I was having a pretty good day I mean I was cleaning all of the kitchen just because I was in a good mood(I know weird but anyway) \n\nSo she doesn't stop the horn till I open the door I'm annoyed because A) we got a doorbell and B)  she could come and just knock on the door. Both would have been infinitely better then laying on the horn. \n\nBML will stand for bitchy mail lady and Me will be me. \n\nBML: Im not getting out of my car till you bring those dogs in. \n\nMe: Its perfectly safe he can't reach you and he's a big suck despite his size. He was just annoyed at the car horn and.....\n\n At this point Titan went back to relaxing in the shade now that this lady was no longer wailing on her car horn and was drifting back to sleep. Having stop the evil car horn.\n\nBML: YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT ITS SAFE HE COULD GET OFF ANY MINUTE. \n\n I'm a little taken aback by this but just chalked it up to some people aren't comfortable around big dogs. Mind you he wasn't anywhere near her or her car to begin with. But I shrugged it off and try to explain its safe to come to the door not wanting to walk down the driveway barefoot and not wanting her to just drive off without delivering the package too me (had a big problem with this while I was at university).\n\nMe: He is attached to steel aircraft cable. It's perfectly safe he can't brea....\n\nBML: DON'T TELL ME HE CAN'T GET THROUGH I HAVE BIG DOGS SO I KNOW HE CAN.\n\n Now I'm getting annoyed at this point between the car horn blaring getting my dogs all riled up and her screaming at me and cutting me off as I tried to reassure her. I'm a pretty relaxed guy so it takes a lot to set me off. Also at this point she had gotten out of her car and went to her passenger side for the package. \n\nMe: Are you going to be here for a few years? \n\nBML: NO, OF FUCKING COURSE NOT. \n\nScreaming and swearing at me that's strike two. \n\nMe: Well then you got nothing to worry about since I just replaced the leads and they are brand new. They won't be getting through anytime soon.\n\n She realized I wasn't about to move and walk  over to her and kinda huffed and grabbed the package and started walking towards me grumbling the entire way.  Now if this had ended here I would have just let it slide unless it became a reoccurring issue.\n\n As soon as she was within two feet of me she threw, not dropped, at me causing me to take a step back to avoid being hit by the box. (neither of which would have been acceptable especially 2 feet away). At this point I had enough I had been screamed at, cussed at, cut off, and finally had the package thrown at me on top of her attitude. \n\nMe: Are you fucking kidding me? \n\nBML: What?\n\nI guess she was not use to people standing up to her crap or wasn't expecting me I would but I had enough of how I was being treated. \n\nMe: You just threw that package at me instead of handing it to me when I'm only two feet away from you. \n\nBML: No, I didn't I dropped it. \n\nMe: No, you threw it at me. \n\n At this point she resumes screaming at me\n\nBML:  WHATEVER. GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT CALL THE OFFICE AND LEAVE A COMPLAINT. \n\nShe then got back into her car and drove off. \n\n So I decided I will call her office and leave a complaint. Because what BML didn't know is there are security cameras all along the outside of my house and it was all caught on tape. \n\n  I go to the NVR which runs the cameras. To make a copy of the video from multiple angles and different cameras to show everything clearly and download it to a USB. Then I went inside to my computer and pulled up the mail service she works for and called their number. \n\n When someone picked up I asked to speak to a manager about BML and got transferred to the route manager or something of that sort for my area. I proceed to explain what had just happened and what my address was so he knew who she was. The manager apologized and said they have received multiple complaints about her and that he would speak with her. \n\nI then asked him if he would like security camera footage of it all happening and if he would like me to bring it in for him or email him it. He said he would and I drove over later that day and handed him the USB. He shook my hand apologized for what happened and thanked me for the footage of it. \n\n I'll never forget the face on BML when she saw me walking out and shaking hands with her boss before he called her in. I guess she also never expected me to actually make a complaint. \n\n Since then they assigned a new mailman my route and I haven't seen her since. I can only assume she was fired based on the numerous previous complaints, plus mine with the footage, and the oh shit look on her face when she saw me. \n\ntl;dr: New mail lady screams, swears, and throws my mothers package at me. Tells me to make a complaint. So I do and hand her boss the footage then shake his hand in front of her before he calls her in. \n",

        "text": "My son is a carbon copy of me. Stubborn to a fault, and will shoot himself in the foot just to spite you.\n\nA few years ago, my son was 3. We'd recently picked up a family dog. This dog was very friendly, but very energetic, and loved nothing more than to destroy things. We'd buy \"indestructible\" toys for him that would be destroyed before the end of the day.\n\nThe dog really was a good dog, just extremely high energy and we weren't fulfilling his needs. Eventually we re-homed him to an acreage where he had another dog to play with, and was much happier. He just wasn't a match for our family/what we could give him at that time in our lives.\n\nMy son didn't like to go to sleep. I liked being able to snuggle with my wife and maybe even have sex before going to sleep. It wasn't uncommon for my son to stay up well past midnight. One night, much like many of the others, I lost my cool (I shouldn't have) and, after trying myriad other things, I took my son's stuffed animal - the one he's had since birth - and told him if he didn't go to sleep, I was going to give it to the dog.\n\nI didn't mean this. This stuffed frog, already threadbare and falling apart, was my son's most prized possession. It meant the most to him. He couldn't go anywhere without it. He couldn't sleep without it. He couldn't calm down without it. It really, truly, meant the world to him. I knew this, and I would never intentionally take that away from him.\n\nExcept I threatened it. And he looked me defiantly straight in the eyes, and told me to go ahead.\n\nNow I was trapped. He knew I didn't mean it. This fucking three year old called my bluff. I couldn't let a three year old win. So I took his stuffed frog and calmly walked over to the dog and tossed it into his paws. My son followed me out of his room to watch me do this. Then I turned to him and told him it was done, and to go back to bed.\n\nHe went back to bed, and the most heartwrenching sob came out of his room. It still brings me close to tears just thinking about it. My son was sad.  I was sad. The fucking dog was sad. The dog just sat there looking at the stuffed frog, as if saying \"wtf do you want me to do here man? This isn't mine. The kid loves this thing.\"\n\nThe dog didn't touch it. The smart good boy that he was, he knew it wasn't for him, even though I'd given it to him. I quickly rescued it from the dog, waited a few minutes, and brought it back to my son - who quietly took it back, hugged it close, and fell asleep crying.\n\nI've failed a lot as a parent, but I never felt such a failure as then.\n\nWhat's the malicious compliance here? Both of us, I think. He MCed by calling me on my bluff, knowing that if he didn't have his stuffy, I'd never rest again. I MCed by calling him calling me on his bluff, knowing that he'd never rest again.\n\nThe dog was the most intelligent one of us all.",

        "text": "I've lurked here for quite a while and finally have something to post about. It's nothing grand, but it gave me a good chuckle. \n\nA little backstory: I work in a family owned, single-screen movie theater with possibly the most batshit crazy woman on the planet. We'll call her Susan. Susan is an absolute control freak who has a compulsive need to do everything around the theater herself. She refuses help when doing anything, and later will grill me and my coworkers about how we get nothing done. Add to this her inability to do basic math when totaling customer orders, drinking absurd amounts of Red Bull every day and having a constant desire to kiss the manager's ass. She ranges from being a minor nuisance to a source of unholy rage for everyone who works there. Even our manager hates her, but since she is related to the owners, nothing can really be done other than try and ignore her. \n\nOn to the story: I'm working alone with Susan (this happens pretty often, especially after a few weeks into a movie's run). I'm at the concession stand while Susan is at the box office. A family comes in and as I'm getting ready to serve them, Susan jumps in the concession stand with me to make sure it's done correctly. \n\nNow, I don't know if many of you know this, but working a concession stand is pretty damn easy, especially when only one family is ordering. But to Susan, I'm clearly unable to do it by myself. It was so important that this family be served correctly that any customers who wanted to buy tickets from the box office would just have to wait. I'm already a little annoyed by this, but it's such a common thing for her to do that I just roll with it. \n\nThe family orders three of our [kid packs](https://imgur.com/a/isjQZo1). I fill them with a decent amount of popcorn and set them on the counter. When Susan is done with their drinks, she looks at the packs and I could almost see her brain short-circuiting. The conversation went something like this:\n\n**Susan:** \"TheKaijuSlayer, you need to put more popcorn on these.\"\n\n**Me:** \"(Manager) told me not to fill them too high so they don't spill everywhere.\"\n\n**Susan:** \"I don't care. They *need* more popcorn so they can enjoy their experience.\"\n\nI guess pouring more popcorn into these containers will somehow make Jurassic World 2 a better movie. So, I take the packs back to the popper while Susan apologizes profusely to the family (who, by the way, didn't even ask for more popcorn). I make sure to pack as much popcorn into these bad boys as I possibly can. It spills into the drink and candy holders, but I do not relent. The gods of starch and butter are on my side that night. The peaks of Everest will cower in the shadows of my mighty, buttered pyramids. I make sure to set them back on the counter gently so that we aren't killed in an avalanche, but *a lot* of popcorn falls in the process. \n\nThe family takes their snacks and they go into the theater. These poor children, at first delighted by their salted mountains now realize the danger of what they are holding. They walk slowly, as if carrying a lubed bowling ball across a frozen lake, but a lot of popcorn spills on the way to their seats, popcorn that Susan would need to sweep up herself if it was going to be done right. She doesn't speak to me for the rest of our shift.  \n\nTL;DR - Crazy woman I work with insists I need to fill some kid packs with more popcorn. I oblige, and serve three popcorn mountains that she'll need to clean up after.  ",

I work for a vendor for insert legacy airline here. We do ramp, ticket counter and everywhere in between at a medium airport. My role is what you call operations I deal with fuel loads, record keeping, filing, coordinating with various regional airlines stuff like that. It is an easy job so I often go out and help with flights particularly if there is more than one on the ground at a time. During this particular time I was working four 10hour shifts over the Thursday to Sunday. So o would be there for all of the mid day flights we call them turns. Except for Saturday at the very end of my shift we had an plane come in that stayed overnight. There were 6 of us working it because it was at the point where the mid shift and the night shift overlap. After we offload the bags in a cart one of the mid guys typically me would go off and bring the bags to the baggage claim. While the other 5 people cleaned the 50 seat (CRJ 200) aircraft. By the time I got back from dropping the bags they were typically done if not finishing up cleaning. Well the one night crew person we will call him Joe got it in his head that I was slacking off while dropping so I wouldn't have to clean (mostly because one of the other mid guys typically did) also keep in mind I helped out because I was bored. One night Joe flew off the handle and started yelling and screaming at me getting in my face calling me lazy saying I should pull my weight because I hadn't been helping clean blah blah blah then he started trying to get me to hit him. Finally after he was calmed down by a co worker Joe said why don't you try doing your job. \nI calmly said you are right I have been neglecting my job and from now on I will focus more on doing it. Thinking he had successfully intimidated me to helping clean next week he got all smug.\nFast forward to the next Saturday and the over night plane arrives Joe always the last one to get going out on the ramp spots me in the operations office sitting at the computer. Getting all huffy he started asking why I was not heading out to help with the flight. I just looked at him and said I am focusing on my job. I am the operations agent after all and during this time I am supposed to sit there in the office and monitor the phone/radio for calls.  From that week on I sat in ops doing my job with my feet on the desk and waved at Joe as he wandered out to work that last flight face bright red. The other workers thought it was funny because all Joe accomplished was adding more work on himself (they made him pick up the slack as now only 4 people were cleaning).",

Nothing would survive, it would be like starting over.  Not a bad idea.  Many companies do this, particularly meat packaging plants. \n\nMy foreman was a bitter woman.  She was the worst ball buster there was.  She would throw you under the bus and berate you every chance she got.  Unless that is, you were one of her friends.  They got a free pass. \n\nShe was tasked with helping spearhead this heat treatment project.  We had a temporary enclosure made out of very heavy mil plastic sheeting and a steam wand teed off the plant's steam boiler piping.  We tossed a couple temperature probes in the enclosure.  This whole thing was a proof of concept before the owner dropped a fortune on a gigantic oven big enough to fit a few medium sized cars in, for heat treating equipment.  \n\nSo my foreman delegated the task of trialing the heat treatment process even though it was her project.  She wasn't very bright, so she made me do it because I was the new guy.   We had an entire production line shut down for a week.  I had to move every single piece of equipment across the building and steam cook them one at a time.  Some of these machines weighed as much as two tons.   I was lucky to get a couple pieces of equipment done per day.  \n\nI told my foreman that the heat was too much for the food grade grease in the bearings, the hydraulic systems, and the moisture from the steam would destroy electrical components.  She didn't care.  Very rudely she told me not to ask any questions and just do what i was told.  Being a foreman in an industrial environment, I could not believe how mechanically inept she was.  This was not the first time she had directed us to make bad decisions with expensive equipment. \n\n\"OK\"  I said \n\nI spent the next 4 days getting paid over $20 an hour to destroy hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment.  All the bearing shields blew out, all of the seals on the hydraulic motors failed, and I destroyed the contents of a few electrical panels along the way.  The problem was that the temperature probes were placed on stainless steel pieces of equipment.  If the surface of that equipment was 175\\*F the air inside the enclosure was well over 250\\*F near the top of the enclosure.  Heat rises bro! \n\nThe maintenance department was absolutely livid.  A dozen pieces of equipment needed total overhauls.  Sensors were damaged, electrical contacts were corroded.  Everything was covered in hydraulic oil from the fluid expanding and rupturing the housing and disconnect seals.  It was a nightmare.  Our plant manager was understandably upset and wondered why my foreman didn't call him after I ruined the first piece of equipment so we could stop and reevaluate the process.   I didn't catch any heat for it.  ....And my foreman later on was let go for personal misconduct.  I'm sure destroying a bunch of equipment and incurring a week or so of lost production time didn't look good on her resume. \n\n*EDIT* \n\nFor those of you asking, I did my due diligence and I felt guilty about what I did but I wasn't risking being fired for insubordination.  I talked to a foreman on another shift and our maintenance supervisor but my orders remained the same.  I was a new employee and I had no idea how to get in touch with the owner or other people in higher management.  It was a huge company that employed thousands.\n\nI don't know the exact way it panned out they obviously don't tell us why our boss is gone. I am sure this incident didn't do her any favours. A bunch of us were questioned by upper management about some other incidents, namely having a relationship with a subordinate.",

        "text": "On mobile, sorry etc. \n\nThis happened about 6/7 years ago so details are fuzzy but I always recount this story when people ask me what the customers are like. I work for a well-known burger place, drive-thru included, and was running the said drive-thru this particular Saturday. I was the one responsible for putting the correct food in the bags for the customers. \n\nThe way our drive-thru was set up back then consisted of one-lane and a speaker box order point, it wasn't uncommon for one cars' order to be accidentally added onto the previous cars order and for us to either remove the unwanted items before payment, or give a refund for any orders that were added accidentally. \n\nThis particular car had made a pretty big order, 5/6 burgers and the same amount of fries, but also had been charged for a meal (nuggets) which was for the car in front. They were given the refund for the nuggets and all was well. I had asked for the car to be parked up as their food wasn't quite ready yet and I carried on with the other customer's orders. When all of the food was ready for the parked car I bagged it all up and sent it out with one of my colleagues, simple. \n\nAbout 2 minutes after the food goes out, a man approximately 6'2\" and red in the face comes in looking like he is about to burst a vein. I go over and ask if he's okay, can I help? \n\nI will be ME, red man will be RM. Conversation as follows:\n\nME - \"is everything okay?\"\n\nRM - \"you missed all of my burgers\"\n\nME - \"I'm sorry?\"\n\nRM - \"I'm parked up outside and you've missed my burgers out of my order\"\n\nME - \"oh, are you the car waiting for 2 Mac's, a chicken sandwich, two cheeseburgers and a double?\"\n\nRM - \"yeah but we didn't get it all\"\n\nME - \"I see, did you bring your bags in so I can check?\"\n\n(It's important that customers bring their food back for any complaints so we can make a proper diagnosis)\n\nRM - \"no, I'm not going back out to the car\" (approximately 30 feet)\n\nBy this point my manager (M) has appeared by my side to make sure I'm okay - I'm 5'2\" and older than I look. \n\nM - \"we can't do anything about your order being incorrect without seeing what you were given\"\n\nRed Man then turns and storms out of the door muttering as he goes, I go back to work. \n30 seconds later Red Man returns, one bag in hand. \n\nME - \"I'll just take a look, what was it you were missing?\"\n\nRM - \"a big mac, chicken sandwich, cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger, make my order right!!\" this struck me as odd because I knew I'd packed the food into a big bag, and if I'd missed all of that food out I would have sent out only 3 burgers. \n\nI take the bag from Red Man and start to unpack, one big mac, another, one chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger, two single cheeseburgers and the chicken nuggets (for which he'd been refunded).\n\nI look at Red Man and he looks at me, I think it's a few seconds before he realises what he's done, and I pack up his bag, minus the nuggets and hand it back to him and he leaves, probably embarrassed.\n\nTL;DR man compalins I gave him too little food, he leaves with less than I gave him initially. \n",

This happened on a night shift when we have soccer games on. \nAt this point i had been with the company a couple of years and had learnt all the tricks people thought they could pull. But this guy took it to a new level.\n\n\nAt this center we arrange the soccer games,provide the ref and do all the league tables,  kinda like the whole world cup currently going on. \n\n\n\nThis guy had called in the day as he was strugling to field a team, he had postponed his last match and as a result had 2 games that night. He spoke to my colleague who tried to find him players with not much luck.\n\n\nHe comes in and bitches about this ( not my fault dude you dont have reliable friends) and tries not to pay till after the matches ( if it even happens). I told him hell no there are people walking around between games go ask them. My ref then comes in and tells me this guy has gotten someone who is banned ( and for good reason) to play his match. He then walks in 5 minutes later happy as a clam ready to pay. I take his payment the ref walks by and i grab him and say if he want to kick off using the banned player tell him no if he still insist walk off the pitch and come inside ( incase the guy gets violent. You need to watch out for your staff). \n\n\n15 minutes later........\n\nMy ref walks in then, this guy is beetroot red in the face marches in and demands his money back because i tricked him. I sit there blank face staring at him. I ask him what do you mean you said you got enough players so you paid. You were informed by the ref before you came in the first time that the guy was banned. How was i to know you drafted a banned player.......\n\n\nHe stands there and sputters, open and closes his mouth like a fish while trying to contradict me. He cant find an argument so starts starts calling me every nasty name under the sun. I then point out the sign that says we have a zero tollerance to staff being abused and he is well on his way to a ban and being billed for the rest of the seasons games and his team being pulled. I thought his head was going to explode. He then demanded a manager. Sadly the manger i had that night had a noodle of a spine. \n\n\nI told my manager he tried to trick me into allowing a banned player to play. But didnt realise i knew the banned player was on site and told the ref not to start the game till that player was gone, and he isnt happy i caught him in his own web. \nUseless manager refunds 1 game. This guy at this point is looking smug. Thinking he outsmarted the system. \n\n\n\nThe next day the area manager shows up and was asking me about the night and how it went(refunds were rare and hardly ever done). I explained what happened and how the manager had acted ( he was off that day). Area manager told me to bill beetroot red guy for the rest of the season and pull his team. The bill also included the refunded game. And noodle spin manager got a verbal warning from the area manager and head office for putting staffs life in danger by allowing the banned player on site ( like seriously this dude eventually got charged with attempted murder a couple years later) ",

        "text": "Ok so I work in a meat department at a grocery store. In one of my previous posts I told a story about a run in I had with a store manager named M. I came out on top of that exchange and he was not pleased about it. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and I’m closing again but this time my boi G is closing with me. A customer comes up at about 8 o’clock and asks me if I speak Spanish. I say no but my boi G does so I pass her off to him. After a few minutes G asks me how thin we can cut a ribeye. I reminded him that neither of us were certified meat cutters and we couldn’t cut anything without a manager or department lead present. G tried his best to explain this to the lady and eventually she just huffed and stomped away. \n\nG and I go about cleaning up when the lady shows up again with M the store manager. He immediately starts yelling at G for refusing to help a customer. G is getting flustered and can’t get a word in, so I step in to explain that we aren’t certified and cannot cut anything without a manager or store lead present. M puffs out his chest like the cock he is and informs me that he is a manager. At this point I just roll my eyes and ask G what the customer wanted again. He said she wanted prime ribeye cut at an 8th of an inch. Meat connoisseurs among you may know that that’s nearly impossible to do since prime ribeyes have so much fat and marbling. The steak would just shred to pieces if I tried to cut it that thin without freezing it first or using a slicer. Though M obviously did not know that. I told him that I couldn’t do it and was about to explain why, but he interrupted me and told me to stop being lazy. \n\nI smiled and grabbed a steak. I went around to the back cutting room so M couldn’t see me cut. I used a cutting ruler and chain glove to get it as thin as possible and sawed away. When I returned to the front I had a shredded mess of prime beef. After the customer obviously rejected it, M called me incompetent and told G to try. G said nothing. He just grabbed a steak and took it to the back. He returned with a similar pile of meat shreds. Once G returned I told M why it wasn’t working and that he had forced us to waste roughly $40 of prime beef rather than listen to my explanation. he said that he would speak to my department manager (A) tomorrow. G and I just laughed and tossed the shreds in with the trim for the next days ground beef.\n\nThe next day A asked me for my side of the story as he had learned not to trust M from my last run in with him. I told him what happened and he relayed it to the store leader. M disappeared for three weeks. When he returned he never bothered me again. And so I lived happily ever after. \n\n\nTLDR: Store manager who I had had beef with before asks me to do slice a steak too thin, and interrupts me when I try to refuse. So I do it and he has to deal with the store leader.",

He only looked at the first slide of the PowerPoint before saying everything looked good but demanded that I put their names on the front and I just pretended that I had forgotten. That night I put their names on the PowerPoint but put a line through them like ~~so~~. The next day I loaded the PowerPoint onto the projector and the whole class and the teacher started laughing because they knew exactly what was going on, one of them gave me a dirty look when he looked at the projector but I don’t think the other one ever realised why everyone was laughing at him.",

Now anyone who has taken a high-school literature class probably knows that symbolism is a big deal, and this particular work happened to fall in the portion of the year devoted to symbolism.  The pattern was pretty straightforward: we read a work before class, the teacher picks passages, and someone in the class has to say what each one symbolizes.\n\nFor the probably 99.99% of people who have never heard of Blood Wedding, the catch is that for this particular play, essentially all the symbolism is about one thing: the penis.  \n\nNow this particular teacher was obsessed with the dirtiest parts of literature.  His summary of the overall body of Arthurian legend was \"if you live in an incestuous family, you always have a date for the prom\".  We had already read the play by this point, so we knew what we were getting into that class.  So while we were waiting for the teacher to arrive before class a bunch of people got together and decided to turn the class into one long session of the [penis game](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Penis%20Game).  The winner was the first one to make the teacher noticeably uncomfortable, which they finally succeeded in the last ten minutes or so of class (the last two contestants were screaming by that point).  There was really nothing the teacher could do about it since they were following instructions.\n\nOn the other hand his decision to schedule this particular work for this particular section of the class was certainly no accident.  I would personally describe it as a case of malicious compliance in and of itself.  He seemed pretty upset that we had all already read Romeo and Juliet by the time we got to his class.  He insisted the only reason it is the most popular Shakespeare play was because it is the dirtiest.  So he almost certainly structured the class to work stuff like this in wherever possible, and this was by far the most extreme case.",

My normal shift Captain and crew were all appreciative of it and came to rely on asking me instead of our “engineer” when minor things broke.\n\nWell this was all fine and dandy until one day when my normal Captain was sick. We got a substitute Captain from another shift who was an ass to just about everyone except the Head Captain and his own crew. Part way through our shift the coffee maker broke down, meaning grumpy commuters and no tips for the crew. I of course set right to taking the thing apart figuring we had nothing to lose. The Captain catches on to the situation (because sailors gossip) and calls me to the bridge. He proceeds to chew me out over how I am not authorized to maintain equipment and should get back to cleaning (his favorite menial task to punish people with) or get off his boat.\n\nIt’d been a long day already (8ish hours into a 12 hour shift) and I wasn’t in the mood for his shit or cleaning, so I just said “K” and walked out. When we arrived at our next stop I grabbed my stuff and got off with the passengers, happy for an early day. The idiot apparently didn’t even notice I was gone for almost an hour according to my coworkers.\n\nThe next day I went to start my shift and found the Head Captain standing on the dock talking to my normal Captain. He informed me that the substitute Captain reported firing me for insubordination and he was there trying to arrange for a morning guy to stay on for a double shift. I explained the situation and both the Head Captain and my captain broke out laughing. Head Captain asked if I’d like my job back, even offered to authorize me to repair minor equipment that is not part of the operational systems of the boat. \n\nI did end up moving on a few months later, and its been almost 13 years now since this incident. I keep in touch with some of my old crew, apparently the substitute Captain is still salty about me not getting fired on his say-so.\n\nEdit: Numerous moths",

        "text": "In an 8th grade science class our teacher gave an assignment in which we had to make an egg drop 10 feet without it cracking. People were using all kinds of elaborate tubes and the like in order to allow the egg to safely roll the ground from 10 feet high. I was a lazy and defiant little shit because I was 13 and that's how being 13 works, so when it came *my* turn to demonstrate, I came up with no tubes which seemed to irritate the teacher but she waited to see what I would do. I raised the egg out in front of me even with the 10 foot line, raised my hand slightly higher, then allowed the egg to drop and splatter all over the floor. \n\nThis enraged the teacher. When she demanded an explanation, I retorted, \"Well the egg dropped 10 feet without breaking. Sure the egg broke 6 inches later, but you never said the egg had to drop *from* 10 feet.\"\n\nShe went quiet for a moment, clearly embarrassed by being showed up by a 13 year old on a matter of semantics, and sent me to speak to the principal. \n\nI was given detention under the grounds of \"deliberately misunderstanding the assignment\". \n\nEDIT: I've received quite a few comments questioning the authenticity of this story...which, first, holy shit seriously guys? This is a pretty darn mundane story as far as stories go. Admittedly it was a little tongue-in-cheek to say she went quiet from sheer humiliation...that was my 13 year old interpretation of course. Far more likely she was pissed that some little punk smashed the egg *quite on purpose.*\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure that calling out that you think a story is bullshit is against the community rules.

        "text": "My background is in CSCI and electronics, but years ago I worked in the deli section of a big chain grocery store. Generally the staff and management were ok, most of us even got along pretty well. Our shift manager (SM) was definitely the \"reactive\" rather than \"proactive\" type though, i.e. don't lift a finger unless something has gone pretty catastrophically wrong, or god forbid you're late by literally 3 minutes.\n\nLike most delis we had a large glass display case stuffed with meats and cheeses, and at any time about 1/3-1/2 of our inventory is on display. The cases pretty much function like a normal refrigerator - lights, compressor, some piping and a radiator. Oh and a few wires to connect it all together.\n\nOne day when I'm near the end of one of the cases I notice the faint smell of melting/burning plastic. Not the first time - the cheese wrapping station has a heated hair-curler-like element to allow you to easily cut plastic wrap, which smells a bit, but this is different. After investigating for a few minutes I realize it's coming from inside the paneled off section of the case, as the smell is much stronger there. It's strong enough for me to recognize as burning insulation - it's a pretty specific smell, as anyone who's had to fix home electronics with a soldering iron can attest. I unplug the case, open up the access panel and have a look around. Nothing has actually melted, but it seems like one of the screws connecting part of the wiring has come loose, and the point of contact is so small it's increased resistance in the circuit to the point that the insulation started getting hot, hence the smell.\n\nI go to look for a screw driver but run into SM on the way, so I figure I'll notify him. I was young and stupid, what can I say...\n\nMe: Hey SM, the insulation in the far case smells like it's melting - loose screw, gonna fix it soon as I find a screw driver.\n\nSM: What? Don't touch anything. Show me the problem.\n\nMe: Ok.\n\nI show him the case with the removed access panel.\n\nSM: Why did you take the panel off?\n\nMe: I was looking for the source of the burning insulation smell?\n\nSM: You can't just take apart company equipment whenever you feel like it, it's probably just from the cheese wrapper.\n\nMe: \\*pondering how to politely tell him to stick his damn face in the case and smell the glistening, semi-melted bit of insulation on the screw*\n\nSM: Close this up and turn the case back on, we can't let let the temp in the case rise or we have to dump the inventory.\n\nMe: ...it's going to start on fire eventually if you just plug it back in.\n\nSM: I'll make one of the facilities people look at it.\n\nMe: \\*no he won't...*\n\nMe: look, all we need to do is tighten that damn screw! The case isn't plugged in, so there's nothing from the liability aspect for you to worry about, and it's not like I can damage the case by tightening a screw that's clearly come out of the mounting.\n\nSM: No. You are not allowed to touch this case unless it's to put the panel back on, plug it in, or take product out.\n\nI decided to let stupidity run its course, this problem is literally above my pay grade. Closed it back up, turned it back on, and stayed the hell away from the thing. Even customers started commenting on the smell of burning plastic by the end of my shift.\n\nI had a couple days off, but then had a day shift two days later. As I  walk up to the store one of the people leaving from the morning shift gives me a sympathetic look as she drives off. Lo and behold, good chunk of the deli is in disarray, with chemical fire extinguisher powder all over the case.\n\nMeanwhile SM was running around ranting about shitty equipment and \"how could no one have noticed\"? Couldn't resist crossing my arms and giving him a \"fucking told you so\" glare before loudly announcing that I'm doing kitchen for the night (i.e. I'm not dealing with this shit).\n\nEnd tally? Everything in the cases had to be thrown out. Not just the case that was on fire. ALL of them were contaminated by the extinguisher.",

        "text": "Since people seemed to like my last story, I thought this would be a good one to share. \n\nI worked in a cabinet factory and had a good team lead and awesome boss. I was not the best employee but I had solid numbers. My job, at first, was to sort out the fleshly cut sheets of wood into an order specified by the documentation and put a sticker on each piece so we knew where it went in the cabinets. After a while I was moved to one of the large panel saws that cut the large 9x5 or 8x4 sheets of particle board wood. Not a fancy or stimulating job but at the time the money was good. I routinely cut the wood and orders faster than the head office could keep up. In fact our entire department was regularly faster than the rest of the shop. That was until new senior management came in.\n\nThe new senior management decided to pay off 47 or so people shortly after they came on. They then, the next day, hired a relative on a high 6 figure salary to help with a new project.\n\nThe upper management decided they wanted to improve efficiency. They would do this by instituting a lean policy and procedure. What this meant was less wood and items would be cut but more often. They started this at the farthest end of the shop meaning that in a few months we would be hit. We thought we were a good and efficient shop but hey, senior management has a new policy so we will do it. \n\nThey also decided to promote our manager. This was good for him but our replacement was a moron. He literally argued with me about the age of one of our saws when they had stamped on them dates for when they were installed in big metal plates, 10 years apart, and argued that the plates were wrong. \n\nAfter a few months, most of the shop was under this new policy and it showed. We were literally being sent to other areas of the shop to help them out because they were falling behind. As I was the starting point for any cabinets or cuts that needed to be made I had to stay near my saw. It did not take long for senior management to come speak to our department informing us that we were ineffecient and ruining their plans and thus, they decided for us to start instituting their plans. One batch at a time, dont start another until the first is completely done. \n\nThis slowed us down by about 50%. We almost started to go at the same pace as the rest of the shop but it was painfully inefficient and slow but were still going faster than the rest of the shop. This also meant that we would have more wood waste, wood that is not big enough to be used for anything else, than before. A lot more.\n\nNow, the MC? I spoke to the other saw operator and decided that we needed to follow the lead and one batch at a time and do it as perfectly as we could. I worked on the generic wood types, the whites mostly for the backboards and main sheets, he worked on the specialty woods for the fronts of the cupboards. My batches were usually 3-4 times the size of his.\n\nWe started to make sure the batch work we got was for one batch only instead of grouped together. We also made sure the cuts we were making were for only the batch we were working on, and making sure that we worked on the same batch together. This meant that when he finished a batch in 30 minutes, he had to wait or help me finish my batch which took 2-3 hours, depending on the size. When our team lead saw this he was upset at first but played along for a while. This slowed us down right to the point we needed to be at for their project.\n\nNot too long after were told that we had to find ways to go quicker, without breaking the new system, because customers were upset their 4 week orders were taking 6-8 weeks. \n\nThat fall the new senior management were all fired for screwing the company over and nearly making it go bankrupt. Shortly there after we all went back to our previous ways and productivity miraculously went way way up.",

It was always along the lines of getting rid of all of my stuffed animals and books, and not caring about it. Well, this obviously got on the nerves of my mom, who had to deal with it whenever a meltdown would happen. She got fed up one day, and decided to go the of malicious compliance. My mom proceeded to haul two garbage bags upstairs for me to fill, one was for books, one was for my stuffed animals.  \n\nI filled them, and continued spouting off, saying that \"I don't care if you donate them, I'm not going to do anything.\"  \n\nThat was a mistake. A very bad one to be exact, as in traumatizing a poor kid for life bad.  \n\nShe once again pulled malicious compliance on me, and said that she had set them outside and they had been picked up by the donation truck. That caused to break down even more, and start running in circles crying. Any kid would want their animals and books back after they made a mistake like that. My mom told me if I would clean my room up and stop going off like that, she'd take me to buy them all back.  \n\nI got one of the MIA stuffed animals back a couple days later, with my mom using a classic excuse of \"One of them fell out, and I just found him lying around the house.\" Me being **INCREDIBLY** gullible back then, I believed every word.  \n\nI didn't know she had played me like a fool. She had actually *kept them the whole time.* Not only was it the stuffed animals, but the books too that she had kept. In the end, I got all of them back. \n\nThat day, I learned a valuable life lesson, and made sure to never spout off again.

        "text": "I was talking to a friend of mine and was reminded of this situation.  I used to work for a big box electronics retailer in the warehouse.  My general manager pretty much hated me and the feeling was mutual.  For several weeks she kept insisting that my truck crew was slacking and going to slow when we unloaded trucks.    \n\n\nWhat she didn't realize was that I had friends at the corporate office, so I emailed one of them and asked if they had a breakdown of timings.  Fortunately he did, and sent me an excel sheet that covered literally every contingency, and allowed me to predict exactly how long it should take us to unload a truck.  As I suspected, not only were my guys not slacking, they were actually finishing the truck around 30 minutes faster that corporate had allotted.  So I emailed her to ask her about clarification regarding our truck timing and mentioned that they needed to hydrate due to the temperatures outside and the work they were doing.  She replied to my email, telling me that she didn't care about hydration, but that my crew absolutely had to have the truck finished in the time allotted by corporate.    \n\n\nSo, the following truck we unloaded everything into the warehouse, then took a 30 minute smoke break and drank water before going back in to finish up.  My crew knew I was feuding with the GM, so they were well behaved, but amused.  She hauled me back into the warehouse and started yelling at me, and I pulled up the excel sheet, along with the email she sent me.  I showed her that we were 30 minutes faster than corporate thought we would be able to handle it at this point, and that since she didn't care about hydration, I made the decision to allow my crew to drink water as necessary, provided they were within corporate guidelines.  She turned red, glared at me, and stormed off.    \n\n\nWe continued unloading the truck for the rest of the time I worked there exactly the same way, as long as we were faster than the spreadsheet, my guys took a smoke/water break for as long as standards said they were still faster than they should be.

The job that day was a simple wedding and I was scheduled to work from 11am-11pm. The moment I got there to the time I left, I was basically on my feet for 12 hours straight. When break time came around, all of us had a nice 15-20 minutes to have something to eat/drink. So, I got my food, an ice cold beverage, and walked over to a table in the back (this was an outside wedding and the table I'm referring to was behind the kitchen tent). I placed my food on the table and went to sit down when I instantly had to catch myself from falling back. The chair that almost made me wear my hard-earned dinner was a cheap, plastic piece of shit with one of the back legs basically bent in half.\n\nI collected myself and found a sturdier chair to sit on. Not soon after did my ass cheeks hit the chair did I hear Rhonda's voice. Rhonda was the manager that night. She was a middle aged, battle-axe of a woman who would have easily beaten Joey Chestnut at yesterdays wiener eating contest. Her plate of food was piled up like you wouldn't believe.\n\n\"No servers are allowed to sit! You must stand!\" screeched Rhonda.\n\nI simply responded by saying that we are all on break and sitting down for a lousy 10 minutes after being on my feet for almost 12 hours wasn't going to ruin the wedding.\n\n\"It's not professional! These people paid for a professional service and you will look professional at all times!\" screeched Rhonda...again.\n\nI basically told her that we are behind a tent and no one outside the company can or will see me sitting plus the people who hired us were really nice, so they would understand. She didn't want to hear any of it.\n\nBefore I left to go blow off steam, Rhonda told me to hurry up and finish eating to get started on side work. She also pointed at the seat I almost had my accident on and said,\n\n**\"This is my seat so tell everyone not to sit in it!\"**\n\nNow I know why the legs on it were so fucked up.\n\nI shot a quick smirk, said ok, and walked into the tent. Not soon after did I let everyone know about not sitting down on break did I hear a loud \"Arrahhhghhhh\" and every server there laugh. I looked over and saw that Rhonda has fallen backwards and slammed on the ground. I felt bad for the people in China...\n\nUpon closer inspection I saw that she was in fact wearing that mountain of food she so gluttonously hogged and was trying her hardest to get up. Not trying to be a total dick, I and a few others offered to help her up which nearly threw our backs out. After getting her back on her hoofs, I calmly looked at her and said \n\n\"Sheesh Rhonda, you should clean yourself up. It's not professional!\"\n\nLets just say I finished the last 30 minutes of my time there getting yelled at....and low-key fist bumping my coworkers on the way out. ",

We work for the buyers only and the sellers realtors are technically not supposed to talk to us. In practise we tend to be polite and keep them in the loop when appropriate but if you push it? Ha bye Felicia. \n\nNow for the good stuff! I got in first this morning and while I was waiting for the Windows updates to finish, the phone rings. I pick up and a realtor proceeds to go on a 10 minute rant at me. She is pissed that the house appraised for 13k less than its neighbors and demands the contact info for the underwriter and a copy of the appraisal. Keeps going on about the rights of the seller (but you know she is just pissed her commission just dropped down). Now. I have worked in customer service for over 5 years and you better believe I tried every bit of de-escalation skill I had. But to no avail. When it becomes clear that I can't help her (really couldn't) she demands my supervisor. *mentally rubbing my hands together in fiendish delight* I explain my supervisor is out but if she leaves her contact info I will be absolutely delighted to make 100% sure he calls her back asap. \n\nMy supervisor is a lot of things. He is a family friend, a great guy and dad, and a veteran who does not ever let someone talk like that to his employees without putting them in their place. It is pretty rare we deal with people where it is necessary but oh boy. \n\nHe walks in about 15 minutes later. I tell him straight what happened. Apparently she is rude in general too! Now it turns out the appraisal is the property of the buyer as they pay for it. And we never give out the contact info for our underwriters. I proceed to listen in delight as he tells her all this in addition to letting her know she had already had, and not used, the opportunity to contest the appraisal, that she was not to contact us in the future, she needed to get her head screwed on straight and learn how the world actually works. Keep in mind she is yelling the whole time so he keeps raising his volume cause like heck is he going to be outshouted! \n\nEnd result: my dignity is avenged, a realtor (hopefully) learns a very valuable life lesson, and my boss gets the satisfaction of verbally beating down someone who really deserved it. \n\nTLDR: realtor shouts at secretary, asks for supervisor with an expectation of getting her butt kissed, secretary is happy to comply by siccing the best boss ever on her.

He was on the phone now with his insurance company hoping to get a replacement soon. He'd been on hold forever.\n\nWhile he sat on hold, I turned on the news and watched footage of a hurricane ravaging Florida.\n\nMy roommate bounced in.

My roommate had been told by some junior employee, \"Look, there's no way we can investigate your claim. Just buy a bike and send us the receipt. We'll reimburse you.\"\n\nNext day my roommate went down to the most expensive bicycle shop in town and explained the situation. Followed by, \"So show me the most expensive thing you have.\"\n\nThey did. He got a kick-ass thingy worth more than two grand.",

        "text": "So this happened when I was a child. My mom, me, and my younger brother were traveling to see relatives a few hours away. My brother was pretty young at the time (probably about 5-6). Before we got into town my brother started saying that he needed to pee and getting really upset. At the first little convenience store we saw my mom stopped and took us inside. \n\nSitting inside was an unkempt, angry little old woman. The second we were in the store she was already mad because my brother was making noise. She very rudely asked my mom “Can you control your kid?” despite the fact that she was literally carrying him, he was just upset. My mom says “We’re just looking for a restroom. My son needs to pee very badly.” at about the same time she sets eyes on the bathroom sign and goes toward it. The old woman screeches “NO NO NO NO. That bathroom is for paying customers only!” and runs toward it to block the door. \n\nAt this point my brother is sobbing and my mom is basically like “Look lady, I’ll buy something after my son goes to the bathroom”. This did not satisfy the gremlin who stomped her foot and demanded “No, you cannot use the restroom until AFTER you buy something.” I wasn’t facing my mom head on but I could practically feel her rolling her eyes as she goes “Are you serious?”. The geriatric demon lady just nodded looking satisfied with herself and said “He cannot pee in my restroom because YOU(aggressive pointing) are not a paying customer!”. My mom pulled down my brothers pants and underwear and told him to piss on the floor. He obliged. He peed A LOT on the floor and some metal shelving. After that we left as the woman was screeching behind us, and I don’t remember the rest of the trip but I will always remember the look on that woman’s face. \n\nEdit: Please keep in mind that I was a child when this happened and this memory from that time of my life and how I remember it as a child. \n\nEdit 2: For those asking why she didn’t just let him pee outside, she said that she didn’t anticipate the woman being so crazy about the bathroom and by the time we were in there and at the back of the store she knew that her options were piss soaked child or letting him pee on the floor. She said the fact that the lady was an asshole helped the decision along. ",

        "text": "2 for 1 special today folks\n\n\nSeveral years ago I worked at a gas station doing overnights. We got the deliveries usually overnight less busy nbd. Job was mostly maintaining the store restocking occassional customer after 3am \n\n\nWell I'm a stickler for protocol and following the book mostly when I'm bored but I digress. \nOne night while working we recieved our usual biweekly milk delivery. \n\n\nThe book protocol for accepting refrigerated deliveries is to check the temp if its outside a certain range reject the delivery. \nNormally its fine so a lot of people skip this step this one night I check the order pick up the crate was like yeah I'll buy a chocolate milk. I pull it out of the milk crate and notice its not as cold as usual.\n\n\nI decide to take the temp cause hmm it was 10°c thats not good.  I call my boss and tell him I'm rejecting the milk order because of the temp and he tells. Me in a very condescending way that \"then we won't have any to sell and to accept the delivery its fine\" I tell him outright this milk is probably bad we should send it back. \n\n\nHe repeats that to accept the delivery thats his order. I reply \"okay fine,but I'm not stocking it.\"\nHe curses a bit but gets over it. Life goes on. \n\n \nNow I really like milk talking 12 litres a week. So I put the milk in the cooler and sign for it tell the delivery guy who is pissed off at having to wait an extra 20 minutes that his cooler is probably broken. \n\n\nI open my chocolate milk and start drinking it do a spit take for chunks in it gag a bit(don't judge me) \n\n\nCall my boss back 10 minutes after i had finished my prior call and told him that yeah all the milk is bad. He has me on camera spewing milk all over the counter. \n\nStart 2\n\nAt this particular gas station we had a fairly aged open face cooler that was actually pretty cold did the temp checks twice a shift.  This one night I noticed the last few nights that the temp wasn't as steady as it normally is.  But still with in accepted range it was also growing louder I reported it to my supervisor. \nThen this night happened it started going outside of the accepted range couple of degrees. \n\n\nStandard procedure is to pull the product and put it in the main cooler put in an urgent ticket with support and go on. However as a sales asc I had to clear that with my manager first so I call him up tell him the cooler is broken and I'm pulling the product. \n\n\nNow I knew I was the only who actually checked the temps. As evidenced by seeing my boss fill in a months worth in 5 minutes \nHe responds \"its fine leave the product there and it will be good.\" I tell him \"that thats a terrible thing to do and I'm pulling the product.\" He repeats \"no to leave it or he's going to suspend me.\" I say sure \"what ever I'll leave it then\" this was the last shift before the weekend so weekend passes I come in and its quieter than usual.  Sign in and start my duties the cooler was still full stocked the temp was 22°c. \n\n\nCall my boss 10 minutes after my shift starts tell him I'm throwing out everything in the open face. And leaving it behind the counter for hin to write off that the cooler was 22°c \n\n\nAfter these 2 incidents I got a lot of leeway to do things overnight for the couple months I had left there. \nThe loss for the cooler was about 800$ the loss for the milk was about 400$ and my lunch.

        "text": "So this isn't my story but my mom's. Woman is the master of malicious compliance and pettiness when someone pisses her off. \n\nSo when I was about 9 my mom was involved in a car accident that wasn't her fault. But destroyed our car. The car was a complete write off. It was about 2 weeks before our scheduled summer holidays and mom just wanted the replacement value of the car she had another car all picked out. She just needed her check from our provincial insurance to pay for it. \n\nThe difference of what they were fighting about was about $400 back in 1994. And my mom was bound and determined she was getting the full replacement value. She just wanted to get a new car so she could take us camping for our holidays. \n\nThe insurance adjuster declined mom 3 times. And she was just getting more and more pissed off. She had every single piece of documentation for the value of her car and the replacement costs and that was all she  wanted. \n\nAs a last ditch effort she even tried reasoning with the adjuster that she had 3 small girls and she just wanted this sorted so she could take her girls on holiday. His exact words were you can have your holiday in the office here for all I care, it's not my problem this is our final offer. \n\nWell my mom took that as a dare. Bright and early Monday morning mom showed up at the insurance adjusters office with a picnic lunch and three girls with toys in hand to have her holiday right there in the office. They're a crown corporations (province owned) and their office and lobby spaces were classed as a public area back then. So they couldn't make her leave.\n\nSo a 9, 7 and 5 year old are playing quite happily and rambunctiously since we'd been told we were on holiday and didn't need to use our going out manners. Which I'm sure you can imagine isn't quiet at all. \n\nThe insurance adjuster called the police to have us removed and show up only to greet my mom by name, since she cut their hair and explain to them that it's a public service office and they can't force us to leave unless we enter an employee only area or stay outside of business hours. One of the officers even sat down with us and was having a cup of pretend tea at our tea party. \n\nMy mom proceeded to tell every customer who asked for the whole morning that she just wanted replacement value for her car. She was just a poor single mom with three kids and they'd made it so we couldn't go camping on holiday but the adjuster had kindly offered to let us have our holiday in their office. With a big shit eating grin every single time. \n\nAbout 1:30pm it's time for nap time for my youngest sister. But of course it's too loud, too bright and she's ridiculously over stimulated and also tired and needs that nap. So like most overstimulated and tired children she kicks off in a huge sobbing tired tantrum. Full volume sobbing about how she wants to sleep and go camping.  She easily went full volume for at least 30 minutes. My mom didn't bother to quiet her just soothed her back. \n\nAt that point the division manager came out and asked to speak to my mom. So I got told to stay put and mind my sisters for a minute. My mom came out 5 minutes later full value check in hand a big smile on her face, thanked the manager. Packed us up, picked up my sobbing baby sister. \n\nTook us home called the sitter to come over and came back 2 hours later with our new to us car with a brand new hitch to tow our hard top tent trailer, packed and ready to go and we set off to go camping.

        "text": "A post from earlier today reminded me about this, it happened about 10 years ago.\n\nMy husband and I were travelling across the country with our two small children (ages 1 and 2) to visit family. When I booked the tickets, I reserved seating together, as you do. When we got the confirmation, the seating was together. When we got to the airport and got our final boarding passes, the seats were . . . not together. (As in, all four seats are spread out throughout the plane.) When I objected I was told to just talk to the agent at the gate and they would sort it out. \n\nSo we got to the gate and it's a madhouse. We were there plenty early, but it was just chaos. So I wait and wait and wait to speak to the agent. They were supremely uninterested in helping me. Told me to just get on the plane and the flight attendants to work everything out. Fine. \n\nWe were supposed to board first. Not only did we have small children, but we were in the first group that was supposed to board after they get the special cases on. No one in the terminal would get out of our way. I've never seen a group of people so rude. So whatever, we just get in line towards the back. \n\nWe finally get on the plane, my husband and I are each carrying a kid, a carry-on, the kid's carry-on, (I paid full price for that seat, you better believe I'm bringing all the luggage I'm allowed!) and a carseat. This is not an easy task. Both kids are exhausted since we thought a red-eye would make them easier to manage and hopefully just let them sleep the whole flight. It's one of the larger planes with two aisles and by the time we get on, almost everyone is seated. I keep trying to talk to a flight attendants, but they keep crabbily telling us to take our seats. We are getting pushed further and further into the plane. No one is listening to us. I finally raise my voice and say I'm not moving another step until one of them helps us. The flight attendant rolls her eyes at me and asks what the problem is. I tell her that there are four of us (motion at hubby and the kids) and that our seats are not together. She looks around at the almost fully seated plane and just says, 'well, maybe someone will move for you.' She doesn't ask them to move, she doesn't attempt to help us, she just walks to the back of the plane. \n\nI explain the situation to the family seated on both sides of one of our seats and ask if they wouldn't mind shifting. Nope. Absolutely not having it. Husband asks a couple over on the other side, next to another of our seats, whether they wouldn't mind moving. Nope. I ask people next to the third of our seats if anyone would be willing to move to one of our other seats. No one bats an eye. People pretend not to hear me. I become visibly upset at this point and it sets my daughter off crying. Fine. This is fine. I set her down, drop everything I'm carrying, and crawl over a couple people to start bucking the carseat into one of our seats. (I may have smacked the carseat into their knees, whoops, clumsy me!)  I wedge our carry-on stuff into the overhead bin and pick up my crying daughter, crawl back over the people and start buckling her into her seat. Then I walk back up to the front of the plane were one of our seats is and settle myself in. I can hear her screaming the whole time. People around her are getting upset. I'm seething and trying not to cry myself. I find out later that my husband saw what I was doing, thought it was hilarious, and did the same thing with our son. All of the sudden, a flight attendant comes rushing up to me and asks if I will get my daughter to stop crying. I loudly say, 'you refused to help us and no one was willing to change seats with us, she's their problem now.'\n\nSeats opened up within seconds of me saying this. \n\n\nETA: Sorry if there was confusion on this point; yes, I paid extra to have the seats together. It was the first time we’d taken the kids on a cross country trip and I went full out ‘first time mom’ on it and over-prepared for everything. \n\nFrom my point of view this was entirely the airline’s fault for promising something, failing to deliver, and then failing to fix the situation. I think the jerks, I mean people, not willing to shift seats were being rude and ridiculous (and yes, entirely within their rights), but hey, I’m totally happy to saddle you with a cranky, tired baby if that’s how you prefer it!\n\nETA (again): Holy Moses. I did not expect this to blow up my phone. And was completely unprepared for the amount of vitriol this would unleash! (Which, admittedly, I should have expected. Hello internet.) \n\nI’m not going to defend my character because this is the internet and you’ve already decided. \n\nI will clarify a couple of points because I seem to have a lot of people asking me the same questions. \n\nFor the sake of just presenting a quick(ish), funny story, I left out quite a bit of detail. Yes, I advocated for myself every step of the way. My problem was continuously shuttled down the line to become the next guy’s problem. I just didn’t want to bog down the story repeating every word of every conversation I had with people. I never did pull a ‘can I speak to your manager’ on anyone, which in all fairness I probably should have, and it’s especially amusing to me how many people assumed that the kind of person I am.\n\nNo knees were hurt in the making of this story. Good grief, it was a theatrical embellishment. I defy anyone to wrestle a bulky car seat past two large adults without invading someone’s personal space. No one was injured, but I’m sure they were inconvenienced. \n\nWhile I’m in the topic of these large individuals, I failed to outline the details of the conversation with them, but they were exceedingly rude. I mean really, who doesn’t move out of the way to let someone access the window seat? I thought everyone did that? Isn’t that just common courtesy?\n\nAnd finally NO. I did not intend to actually allow my baby to fly on a cross country red eye without me. I was exhausted, upset, at the end of my tether, and decided that barring an actual full scale tantrum in the middle of the freaking airplane, maliciously complying with this un-winnable situation was the best way to make my point. That point being that someone else has to give here. I’ve given at every possible turn and have literally no options left. All I needed was two individuals on a packed flight to move to another seat. (Both aisle seats, if anyone wants to know.) I didn’t need all four of us to sit together, but I did need to sit next to my baby.\n\nAnd no, changing flights wasn’t an option because reasons. Also, at this point, what has the airline done to make me think they’ll take care of me as a customer? Trust = broken.\n\nPhew, I think that’s it now. I hope you’re all enjoying the holiday, our family has had a marvelous day 😀",

        "text": "A bit of back story first. In year 7 I was suddenly placed in an extra English class instead of doing German. This continued until about year 10 where I was suddenly back in German Classes the teachers and school staff were unhelpful and assumed I'd been doing German Since year 7.\n\nAnyway my last day of high school was coming up in Year 11 and the last exam (the last exam I ever took in high school) was a German Exam.\n\nKnowing this I thought I'd get a bit of petty revenge and malicious compliance all in one. So the night before I made sure to drill as many German insults and swear words into my head.\n\nSo on the last day of high school (in fact it wasn't even a full day I only had to be there for the exam) I sat down. The teachers said I had to answer every question in German. So I did, I left some very insulting German messages to the Exam board (these were the idiots who placed me in the extra English class) underneath each question.\n\nWhole process took me about five mins. Once I was done I pretended to look over my answers to seem like I actually gave a shit. Then I close the exam paper.\n\nTeacher comes over and tells me to basically sleep at the desk (putting my head down on the desk) until the test time was over. Because even if you finished the test you stupidly had to remain there until the time was up.\n\nSo once the test was over I go home tell mum what I did. She laughed, I got no punishment at all since I didn't have to go back to high school anymore there wasn't anything they could do. To be fair though what could they punish me for? I answered all the questions in German and I put my head down on the desk I literally did was I was told.\n\nThe exam board gave me an \"Unclassified\" grade. Doesn't mean failure it means my work was so bad (or my insults were that good) that they refused to issue me with a German GCSE. I didn't give a shit about my German grade because I knew I didn't need it.\n\nWell at least I learned some German ;)\n\nEdit: Had to resubmit due to the title having symbols in it.\n\nEdit 2: I used Google translate to get all the insults I needed.

We had to make sports day banners for our teams in grades 6 and 7. It was our job. My team was the red raptors, and the logo we had chosen was just the Toronto raptors logo, but without it saying Toronto. The day before sports day, the logo has been outlined and just needs to be painted in. Except, this logo is about 6 feet high. So it would take a while to paint with a group of friends to help. Most of my team was at a track meet, and those who were at school were studying for a math test on multiplication. Who needs to study for that?!?  They had also been blowing me off for weeks while we worked on setting up sports day, and many of the kids “studying” were people who had bullied me. So, being the petty little bastard I was, I got my friends to help me paint it. Keep in mind, all they said to do was colour it. So we made its clothes pink, gave it a moustache, and a monocle. I followed their rules. The sad thing was I wasn’t going to be at school on sports day, I had a dentist appointment. My friends told me they had to throw away the poster and make a new one in the 30 minutes between the start of school and the start of sports day’s “ opening ceremony”. They said that the paint wasn’t even dry. ",

One of the items we sell is an arch which uses wooden beams at the top to create the arch. Just so we can alter any drapes or floral decorations on it, we use two separate pieces of wood on this. They can hold a reasonable amount together, but not individually. \n\nSo one day, this guy hires out his wedding. He hires about 40kg of floral decorations for the arch, but has a certain demand; we only use one of the beams for the arch. Now, he had already tried to cheap out on smaller parts of his wedding ( Keeping chair covers and bows a plain color to remove cost), but we did get a bit worried about this request. When we were taking the job out, my Operations Manager (We'll call him OM) tells the crew to take the second beam anyways.\n\nWhen we get there, this guy (who we'll call FG for fat groom) meets us on sight. Normally, whenever a client shows up on site, we know there will be trouble, but decide to ask him to confirm one final time that he only wanted one beam, as stated on our picking slip. He confirmed, and we decided to just give FG what he wanted. After setting up the arch, I made sure to warn him not to put too much more weight onto the beam, and he stated that he wouldn't.\n\nAbout 4 hours later (the wedding had been going for 2 hours by now), we get a call from FG, demanding that we come down to the wedding to 'fix up that piece of shit arch'. We show up, and guess what? The beam had snapped. Apparently FG was showing off with his mates, and tried to do pull-ups on the arch. He wanted us to fix the beam, and THEN reimburse him for 'providing him with an incomplete product.' We said no, we had warned him about this, and now he had broken our gear. He tried to threaten OM with a legal case, until OM stated that he had requested that he only received one beam, and now owed the company a pretty decent fee for the damages done to the beam. FG meekly obliged, and we now have a good laugh about it at work functions.\n\nTL;DR: Guy orders an arch and tries to cheap out on it by removing one of the main parts; ends up snapping the beam and paying more to repair the beam.",

The customer then confirms, \"So, if I leave the call running, and don't hang up, you can't hang up either and you don't have to do any other work?\" AM confirmed that was correct. The customer then asks AM if he'd like his afternoon to be freed up, asks what time AM gets off of work, and promptly muted the phone and left the call running until right before AM left for the day. Because the customer had called into a toll free number, he wasn't charged anything for the call. AM read a book the rest of the afternoon and had a great story to share later.",

        "text": "I think this fits if not feel free to delete.\n\nSo when I was young 6-8 my favorite game was hide and seek as I always won. Well after a while it got really boring as they never find me and eventually I'd just come out for whatever the next activity was. Eventually no one wanted to play it with me. Fine I don't mind I was bored of it too.\n\nWell after a few months my cousins decided they wanted to play hide and seek again having seemingly forgot. Well I didn't want to but they whined to an adult and the adult said I had to play. Well at first I just chose shitty hiding spots. Them having found me too easily complained again \"Nic_Mudkip isn't playing right!!\" So the adult said \"Go hide properly and stop being a brat\" Little me said \"Fine!\".\n\nSo to prove a point I picked my best hiding spot. Under my bed with my toys. So I crawlled way into the back near the wall and surrounded myself with toys. I was invisible as the toys hid me completely and it was dark in the corner. The first 15 minutes went as usual the searcher finding all my cousins quickly. Come 30 minutes all the kids were searching for me. By this time someone had looked under the bed like 5 times but I laid super still and held my breath. By an hour the other kids gave up and went outside to play a different game. Normally I'd come out after they gave up never telling where I was. But I was a stubborn kid proving a point. \n\nBy 2 hours the adults realize I wasn't playing outside with the other kids. And the kids said they couldn't find me. The adults searched for me at first casually but after the first sweep they started panicking thinking I had left the house. I let them search for me for a good 20 minutes including using flashlights under the bed and in the closet. Once they freaked enough they got my mom who was sleeping at the time. My mom came into my room and said \"I know you are here somewhere come out now.\" In her tone of don't fuck with me. So I did. She glared at me and asked why I didn't come out when the other adults called. I told her they said to hide properly so I did. She was pissed at being woken up and my smart assery. She then gave me a rule that I was no matter what supposed to come out when called by any adult. \n\nTldr: I was told to play hide and seek properly so I hid for hours until they panicked and had to get my mom. The \"adults\" we're older cousins, my aunt and uncle\n\nYeah my mom was used to me being overly specific in following instructions. ",

        "text": "I arrived to the first day of an art history class (on a Monday) to find it standing room only. Every seat was taken and at least a dozen students were lined up along the back of the room.  The professor came in, saw us standing back there, and slammed his things down on the desk, ranting at the damned registrar's office for overbooking the room AGAIN - he tells them every semester that this room can only hold X students, and every semester they schedule at least (X+12).  \"So those assholes think I can teach (X+12) students in here? We'll just see about THAT!\"  And he launched into his lecture.  (Oh, that's not ominous at ALL. /s)\n\n\"Launched\" is an understatement - he covered TONS  of material, LOTS of detail, barely pausing for breath, FLYING through his lecture.  At the end of class he said \"We'll have our first exam on this material Wednesday. I hope you took good notes.\"  \n\nWednesday, the exam was brutal. Absolutely awful. He had cover so much material so fast... there was just no way.  I could feel my soul trying to flee my body.  \n\nFriday, we got our exams back. I somehow passed  with a low C.  My art-major friend who was sure this class would be an easy A got a D-, one point from failing. Many did fail; a few scored 30%.  \n\nMonday, the professor entered the room... noted that everyone was seated ... checked his updated roster and found something like 20 students had dropped.  He smiled and said \"Everyone has a seat? Good. That's more like it. Last week's exam doesn't count.\"  \n\nThe rest of his class was enjoyable, taught at a normal pace, entertaining class discussions, easily passable if you were paying attention at all, easy A if you put any amount of effort into it.  And everybody had a seat. :-)  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nTL,DR: registrar books too many students into small classroom, professor adjusts class size himself.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nEdit: moved TLDR to bottom, and on further consideration, it was terrifying for everyone that first week, and only ended up amusing to the people who didn't drop, who found out the first grade was thrown out and the whole first week was just an act.  Agreed with /u/ClandestineIntestine below, it was a shitty thing for the prof to do - malicious compliance (in a way) against the registrar, but at the expense of the students.  I do feel bad for the people who dropped the class thinking it was not passable. \n",

        "text": "This story was pass down to me by my dad about what his dad did when my dad was little.\n\nMy grandfather was in the military and was stationed in Germany with his family.  This was him, my Grandmother, and my aunt.  They lived there for a few years and during that time my Grandmother got pregnant and had my dad.  \n\nWhen his deployment was over and he returned home, my dad didn't have a passport yet but he had the proper documentation, a citizenship certificate, birth certificate, and letters from his commanding officer, the base doctor, and delivery doctor.  When he was passing through customs, even with the proper documentation, the agent wouldn't clear my dad because he didn't have a passport.  My grandfather was a Drill Sergeant (I don't know if he was before or after this incident) and could yell and argue with the best of them so he and the agent heatedly went back and forth for a while. All the while my grandmother stood behind him, embarrassed of the attention the commotion was causing, holding my two year old dad up with one arm and my aunts hand with her other hand.\n\nAt one point the agent yelled at my grandfather something along the lines, \"I don't care what you think you know, you're not bringing that kid in here.\"  To which my grandfather only said OK, turned to my grandmother, ripped (always the wording when told to me) my dad out of her hands, placed him on the agents counter, and took my grandmothers and aunts hand and started briskly walking away.  \n\nThe poor man realized my grandfather was serious (no-one knew how far my grandfather would have gone to prove his point) and begged and pleaded for him to come back. My grandfather did come back after a minute and took my dad and his stamped papers without saying a word and left.  The agent didn't say anything after that either.\n\nTL:DR   Baby Dad didn't have a passport, Customs agent said he couldn't come in the country, Grandpa said OK and left him on the counter.\n\nEdit: wow my first gold. Thanks stranger. Also as it was pointed out in the comments the guy was most likely an immigration agent not a customs agent. \n\nSome more background: My dad is turning 60 this year so he might have been younger as this happened a long time ago and my grandparents are no longer with us to ask for clarification.  This occurred after they had flown back to our own country from Germany. I don't know the rules now but at the time my Grandfather didn't need or didn't have time to get the passport but he had all the required documentation and was cleared on the European side. \n\nMy grandfather was a man who would yell big but was all bark, no bite and never at his family. This served him well while he was a drill sergeant and well into his retirement as a minor league hockey coach/manager. He was a season ticket holder to our local pro hockey team and would always yell insults (but never obscenities) at whoever was the refs for the game. When he passed the radio station mentioned him and that the arena would be a little quieter from now on.\n\nIf I might share one more story about my grandad from my dad. My dad was also a season ticket holder but they couldn't see each other because the scoreboard was in the way. Even though they couldn't see each other, my dad could always tell if my grandmother was at the game.  During the break after the first period my dad would watch the entrance to the stairs to the section. If my grandad was eating an ice cream there  my grandmother was at the game, otherwise my grandad would have walked back to his seat to eat it.\n\nEdit2: My dad read the post and his only correction was that this was in 1960 before people flew everywhere so they had arrived back on a passager liner (ship).

        "text": "I do tech support for a medium-sized retailer.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, we got a new boss.  Old boss was an incompetent asshole, so this was a good change.  At first, new boss seemed like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThen, as many new bosses will, he started changing things.\n\nThere was a lot about the department that *needed* to be changed;  old boss' mismanagement had left us undertrained, understaffed, and incredibly disorganized.  But new boss' changes didn't stop at the necessary, he started feeling the need to replace things that *did* work just because it wasn't what he'd had or used at his previous job.\n\nI'm sure you all know the type.\n\nOne of the changes new boss made was to sign us all up for a training website where you watch videos and take practice exams.  Now, this site costs a moderate amount of money to sign up for, so he added a requirement of 5 hours of training videos a month, which we do on the clock.  All of us were fine with this; it gave people a break, and many of the video training tracks are certification training.\n\nThen one coworker quit.  And it took forever to replace him.  \nThen another coworker quit.  And it took forever to replace him.  \n\nSuddenly, our workloads had shifted.  We'd lost two people who knew the systems inside and out, and gotten two noobs.  On top of that, one of the two had been a sysadmin, who we discovered had been screwing shit up for months, and we only discovered the damage after he'd left.  \n\nThis on top of all the unnecessary changes new boss was making left us *very* short on time.  We had to prioritize helpdesk tickets and users, of course, and right below that was all the projects new boss had heaped on us.  Training videos dropped to the absolute rock bottom of our priority list, and for several months were completely overlooked, by us and boss.\n\nThen, last month, boss realized that we weren't watching our videos.  He sent out an angry email reminding us that we need to watch videos, and picked our 4-5 training courses for each of us to watch and take practice exams on.   He decreed that these were mandatory, and needed to be a high priority.\n\nSo, we immediately, like good little workers, dropped everything else to watch training videos.  \n\nSupervisor, our network supervisor who is technically between Us and Boss, walked out of his office to find no tickets being worked on and 11 techs watching movies.  He stormed over and demanded to know what we were doing.  We pointed at Boss' email.  He told us to get back to work, and went and raised hell with Boss.\n\nWe thought that was the end of it.  Then, a week later, another angry email, this time with another mandatory training video for all of us on \"Communications\".  (Turns out being overworked makes techs a bit short tempered...)  He stressed, in 24-point red font, that this video series was Mandatory with a Capital M, and a Priority with a Capital P.\n\nI added up all the little courses that he'd assigned me.  This didn't come out to a few hours of training, oh no.\n\nThe courses he'd assigned me to take came out to over TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS of videos.  \n\nSo I sent out an email, ccd to the whole department.  \n\n&gt;\"Hey, Boss?  That's a lot of training videos.  There's no way we can watch them at work and still get our tickets done.  Can we clock in and watch them after hours?\"  \n\nThe response?\n\n&gt;\"Yes, it just can't interfere with other work\".  \n\nI checked with Supervisor.  HR has a blanket approval on all IT overtime, and I wanted to make sure that email said what it did.  Supervisor and I were pretty sure he hadn't quite gotten the connection, but we agreed that's what it said...\n\nAll of us have put in at least 20 hours of overtime watching training videos - each - for the last few weeks at time-and-a-half.  A few of the guys actually did the full 40.  Payroll blew a gasket.  Finance blew a gasket.  Boss hasn't rescinded the order, however, or told us we can only watch so many hours a week...\n\nSo every day I clock out of work, drive home, clock back into work and watch training videos and get paid to wash dishes, cook dinner, fold laundry, crochet...",

Some of the HOAs have overzealous enforcers that send threatening letters about any little thing.  Have your Christmas wreath on your door on January 3rd?  Letter.

I used zip ties to attached the top of one net to the bottom of another.  This created a long, chained together net that reached the ground (goal was lowered... kids).\n\nSo I hung it up and there it sat.  I was in full compliance with the rules, so there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nOne neighbor ask me about it and I explained what happened.

An area that would be covered by a dedicated busboy is now my bussing responsibility, along with my normal bar area.\n\nI should include that my duties went beyond your average barback. I bussed drinks like any other, but also had to set up tables with silverware, water, and plates. Additionally I refilled guest's water glasses and refreshed bread and butter. So you can imagine that doubling my area of employment might have put additional stress on me. \n\nI was running, ***running*** back and forth from the kitchen trying to keep up. My back is screaming, and I'm repeating to myself \"just get through this shift\" like a mantra. 4 and a half hours in I step outside to have 6 puff of a cig and press my back against the cold concrete wall for some temporary relief. My manager comes out, demanding that I go back in, accusing me of hiding and slacking off. I explain to him that I'm doing my best but he's doubled my floor.

I ignored them 7 times, until I noticed the number this time was the boss, the one directly supervising Edd's training. I explained to him what Edd had said, and he dropped his attitude real quick like. He explained he couldn't hire me back as I had walked out and ignored calls until closing, which was fair, but he also added that Edd's speech wouldn't go ignored in his training.\n\nA few months later I ran into one of the old bartenders at the local roost. I apologized for leaving them high an dry, and explained what Edd had said. She told me that Edd had gotten chewed the fuck out by the aforementioned bigboss, and that as a result it took Edd 6 months longer than expected to become a full fledged manager. Other people on the scene reported him rubbing his big bald head after the pow wow with Mr. Top, saying \"I have a lot to learn\".\n\nHappy I could help with that Edd. It was all about teaching a lesson.",

Every year the rotary group came and I loved working with them and their foreign exchange students.\n\n\nThey all stayed at the camp for a few days and I would run the actual challenges and ropes course but I stayed at the facilities because I liked talking to the kids and I knew the place well so I wanted to help if I could - plus it saved me driving in every morning.\n\n\nThe last year I did it they hired a new woman I will call madam farquard or MF, she is an overweight idiot with no life experience outside of a small town, and backdoor bragged in every sentence like “oh I don’t know how to make French toast- I have a pretty complex pallet so if not eat something like that.” Basically most people hate her the instant they hear her speak. She also spoke like she had a mouth full of yogurt which was both repulsive and fascinating- like wtf caused that?\n\n\nI offered to help with something and she very condescendingly informed me “that wasn’t my job but thanks I guess - why don’t you worry about what you’re paid to do... it seems like enough to keep you busy” So I said nothing while she tried to turn the convection oven on and dinner was 40 minuets late (it sounds on but it’s just the fan). \n\n\nIt’s the next day, the kids are great and we’re doing a team building exercise - and someone gets hurt. They sprained their wrist. I said it was sprained but MF says “you’re not a doctor worry about your job!” I am not a doctor but I was a wilderness first responder and my assistant was a former infantry medic something (they did something medical in the marines but refused to talk about that part of their life so idk what it was but they knew their shit). She wants to go to the ER, we weren’t doctors,  the kid is in a new country and is now scared and wants to go to the ER - whatever. I said they should go to urgent care instead of the local ED because it’s 4:30pm on a Friday, urgent care can do X-rays and I will call to avoid the wait.. MFs response? “I will take her- you’ve done enough!” \n\n\nWell fuck you too. I didn’t call I told them to take food and sweatshirts to the ER she dismisses me again. They didn’t come back until 10pm and all the food places were closed by then and I locked the kitchen up before going to bed, because I too can be a butt. I made sure I was awake to hear about this broken arm- it was a MILD SPRAIN and this European child was appalled they waited in the ER for 4 hours with no one helping them. They were freezing cold and starving. \n\n\nSo this was when the ER used to give heavy pain pills like candy... this kid got pain meds for a sprained wrist. I looked at them and said to the student  “I don’t think you should take these, they’re dangerous and aren’t actually going to help you at all. If you’re wrist doesn’t hurt don’t -“ \n\n\nMF hears this and comes marching over screaming “so now you’re a pharmacist too!! Do your job and nothing else!” Okay - got it loud and clear.\n\n\nMF gives the girl the meds and sure enough not even an hour later she starts vomiting and MF is tired and doesn’t want to deal with it. She asked for a bucket (because it’s dark) “that’s not my job”. Where are gloves and cleaner? “Not my job”. Do you have gum? Ginger ale? “Not my job”. MF is now determined to not need my help.\n\n\nMy assist and I left the facilities and stayed at a posh summer camp a few miles from this place and didn’t show up until 10am the next morning when we were scheduled to work. MF was up all night with this vomiting kid who got sick all over the bathrooms so no one else could use it, couldn’t find cleaning supplies, slept late and missed breakfast, didn’t turn the stove on correctly, didn’t remember where the kitchen key was because I unlocked it every morning, couldn’t understand why dishes didn’t magically do themselves, and she couldn’t leave to get anything because she was the only one there. \n\n\nI showed up refreshed, relaxed, and carrying iced coffee- not to drink just as a reminder that I was off work at that time and she was trapped and miserable. She asked to take a nap and I told her she was supposed to be with me and obviously I can’t be trusted since I wasn’t going to take the girl to the hospital. She asked about cleaning supplies and I told her that I had no clue that wasn’t my job, I did remind her my job was to inspect facilities before they got their deposit back. \n\n\nI felt bad for the kid, but I didn’t do it to her. MF ended up cleaning vomit without gloves and with toilet paper and hand sanitizer- I normally would have helped but it wasn’t my job and was probably more than she could have handled. \n\n\nBtw the cleaning stuff was on the back of the bathroom door, which was propped open and had vomit in front of it so she probably found it after cleaning everything. \n\n\nEdit: to be clear MF and not the kid had to clean it , I am not a monster.

        "text": "Long time lurker, first-time poster. Using a throwaway account cause I may have annoyed some people that could make life quite annoying for me if they knew who I was.\n\nAnyway, on to the story. TL;DR at the end.\n\nA few years back, I was working for an organisation funded by the local government. This organisation was putting together their annual film festival when they decided they wanted to send out an email blast.\n\nThe problem was, this contact list hadn't been engaged with for over 2 years. Now, despite this sitting a little ugly against SPAM practices, there was nothing technically illegal about sending the email out, after all, these people had signed up and this was well before the EU GDPR bonanza we're all dealing with now.\n\nCut to me, whose KPIs included such neat little metrics as \"Open Rate\" and \"Click-Through Rates\". I refused to send it. Saying over and over that I was not going to send to a list that is colder than an Arctic winter. \n\nMy boss had gone home for the day so it was just me and my project manager. Despite our protests, the people from the film festival continued to push us, using their close ties to the company's CEO to push their request higher and higher up the food chain.\n\nEventually, the CEO got involved and told us to send the email anyway. We reiterated our concerns and got the final approval in writing from the festival people.\n\nAnd we sent the email...\n\n15 minutes later, we receive an email back... from the office of the state's highest elected official (i.e. governor). That email list we sent to included the right email address for this official... but still had the details attached from the previous person who held that office... over a year before.\n\nA few choice words were said our way but were quickly thrown back when we showed the long email chain regarding our protests. The Project Manager and I had already looped in our boss as well so she came in the next day, ready to stand for us in whatever blow back that would be coming. It never did after we showed that email chain.\n\nTL;DR - Someone who knows nothing about email marketing, tells me to send an email to a 2 year old list. Sends an invite to the festival to the state's governor, addressed to the previous state governor. ",

        "text": "Sorry in advance for formatting. I'm on mobile and this stuff is hard to figure out. Also, I also posted this on r/pettyrevenge as I wasn't sure where it would fit best. Hope that's okay.\n               \nSo I've worked at a popular fast food chain for quite a while now, but even so, there's this one manager and her little crony, let's call them Sarah (manager) and Sally (crony), who insist, *every single time* we work together that Sarah has to explain to me, in detail, how to do my job. \"This is how you take orders,\" \"this is how you wash dishes,\" etc.           \n            \nWell, about a week ago, I got pretty fed up with it. I was just done. I know how to do my job and everyone knows that I know how to do my job. I frequently get scheduled for pre-close shifts  (right before the store closes) because I'm good enough that I make the closers job a lot easier when I pre-close. And that night, I was pre-closing for Sarah. Perfect opportunity.              \n          \nStore policy is that inexperienced persons are not allowed to wash dishes by hand (even though it makes it 10x faster to do so while you use the washer simultaneously), as the head honchos don't want anything not getting washed good enough. So, since Sarah obviously thinks I'm inexperienced, I decide I'm just gonna wash dishes via the dishwasher, even though doing so is so much slower. But I wouldn't want to break any rules, right? Cue the end of my shift, literally maybe a fifteenth of what I would have gotten done had been done, and today, a week later, I learned that after everyone else left, Sarah and Sally had to stay until the openers started showing up in order to complete what I didn't do, since they don't do that stuff very often and are pretty slow at it.        \n           \nMost satisfying moment of my life was to learn that today.     \n       \nEdit: spelling, grammar, etc",

        "text": "I am a recovering alcoholic and stayed in a substance abuse facility about a year ago. The facility was co-ed, and had reasonably strict rules regarding room visits and contact between sexes. The room visit policy was that there could be mixed genders in rooms, but there had to be a minimum of 5 residents present and you must have permission from staff first. Fair enough.\n\nI was on my way to my room and happened to walk by a female friend on the way up the stairs. We stopped at the top of the stairs and chatted for a few minutes. I saw no issue with this, as far as I knew we were not violating any rules in doing so. One of our \"recovery coaches\" saw this and did not seem to agree with me. We'll call this man Kevin. Kevin is an arrogant guy and doesn't like to proven wrong or made a fool of. Neither do I. Kevin and I didn't get along so well. Kevin stormed into the stairway and began shouting at both of us for having an inappropriate room visit. When I calmly pointed out that we were not in either of our individual rooms, and were in fact in the public stairwell, this only seemed to enrage him further.\n\n\"You're not fucking stupid, idonteffwiththewar. You know damn well that these rules apply to other areas of the building and you're just being a punk now about it.\" Kevin proceeded to strip away a bunch of privileges from me and place the both of us on a \"gender ban\". \n\nAll the while, I continued stating my case that I was doing nothing wrong, and that if I somehow had, it was not with malicious intent. He accused me of clearly not being able to read the rules that are clearly posted on the wall.\n\nI decided to take him up on that and read the rules for myself.\n\nOne of the rules stated something along the lines of how room visit policies apply to other areas of the facility, including gym, swimming pool, etc. Etc. Rather vague and open to interpretation. Okay. I suppose that could include the stairway. That really complicates things but oh well. Guess I'll go and inform the other clients of this policy.\n\nBy the end of the day, I had 30 other clients approaching that staff member every time they needed to use the stairs. Since it was brought to my attention that the stairs were now held in the same regard as the swimming pool and the gym, this meant that no client could pass through there alone. They must either have 4 other clients with them, and they had to inform a staff member of their intention. \n\nNeeded to go get coffee? Gotta ask staff so they could assemble and approve a group of 5. Wanted to step outside for a smoke? Gotta ask staff so they could assemble and approve a group of 5. I was front and center of it all insisting that if Kevin allowed any individual client to use the stairs without 4 other clients present, then this is yet another example of an inappropriate room visit, and must be treated as such. He began to get flustered and backpedaled on his claim, but could not come up with any reason why this should be treated any differently than my situation. He eventually reluctantly said that there did not need to be 5 people in the stairwell.\n\n\"So to be clear, there are no stipulations in regards to passing through the stairwell? I just want to be clear because we have like 15 drug addicts here who want to smoke, or go to the recreation room, or, ya know, ETC, but we also wouldn't want to be breaking any rules.\"\n\nHe admitted there was no such rule, returned my privileges to me and lifted the gender ban off of me.\n\nThen I decided to be even pettier. Since it had now been brought to my attention that there was no official handbook rule regarding hanging out in the stairway, I began to assemble get-togethers in the stairs with up to 10 people at a time to bypass the room visit restrictions. Kevin did not like that but did not know how to shut it down. They eventually put in place a rule that movement within the confines of the stairs must remain consistent due to potential fire hazards and they must only be used as a means of getting from one place to another. That logic sat well with me so I didn't fight it.",

        "text": "When I was younger, I had trouble understanding what people meant when they said things (I'm either autistic or ADHD, still no definite consensus), so I often took things literally. I had pretty much figured out what was going on mostly by the time I was 10, but I had enough of a reputation that people didn't really think it was out of the ordinary when I acted like that.  \n\n\n\nAnyways, as part of all the nonsense that was wrong with my brain,  I didn't have a lot of friends in school, so I would often ask my teacher if I could bring a book out to recess. It was probably a pain for her, since public school and low funding and all.  \n\n\n\nOne day, I guess she must have got tired of seeing me sitting on the swings and reading the whole recess, so before she dismissed us, she came up to me and told me that I wasn't allowed to take a book out to recess. I tried to convince her otherwise, even pulling out my own personal book that I had brought to school with me, but this was her reaction to that, word for word as far as I can remember:\n \n\n\n\"No, absolutely not. You're going to go out there, and you're going to play with your friends until I tell you to come back in.\"  \n\n\n\nI did not like that, and I had no friends. So I went out for recess, and when my grade got called in for lunch and everyone lined up to do attendance, I stayed on the swings. I was the only kid who had stayed on the playground, so I stood out. One of the recess aides came over to check on me, and I told her that I wasn't allowed to come back in, because my teacher had told me not to.  \n\n\n\nSo, my teacher got called out of doing whatever she had been doing to ask me why I wasn't going in. Our conversation was essentially:  \n\n\n\n\"You told me not to come in.\"  \n\n\n\n\"No I didn't. Why don't you come in?\"  \n\n\n\n\"You told me not to.\"  \n\n\n\nAnd on and on. Had she asked me \"Why do you think I don't want you to come in\", I would have gladly explained the situation. \n \n\n\nAgain, mean brainweird kid, dislikes this teacher, and has a reputation for not understanding directions? Nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\n\n\nMe and the teacher kept going on about it in a circular conversation, until one of the recess aides asked me why I thought that my teacher had told me not to come in, which I happily explained. It's not as though I got off scot free- no recess for two weeks, had to write an essay about respecting school staff, etc. On the plus side, that particular teacher basically never gave me any requests to make new friends for the rest of the year, and I heard she had to spend the time that my class spent in art class talking to the counselor about how best to interact with brainweird students.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR: Teacher tells me to go to recess and play with my (nonexistent) friends until she tells me to come back in, she forgot what she said, and I made her look like she had no idea how to deal with her students.**",

Another group of students however would always be playing rough and leaving a mess causing the teachers to kick us out if that spot nearly every day.\n\nSome teachers didnt care but a few in particular hated us being their and whenever it was their day to supervise they would go straight over a kick us out. this happened constantly, multiple times a week for months with us having nowhere else to go due to the school’s strict rules and the cold weather outside.\n\nAfter months of this a teacher got fed up and printed signs saying “strictly no eating, sitting or drinking in this area”. Now nobody liked the teacher so we carried on as always until a week later i pointed out that the sign said nothing about standing.\n\nThat day at lunch we all made sure we were standing and had no food or drink out and our principal approached us one day for the usual eviction.

        "text": "This occurred quite a few years back on a base far away....\n\nWhen it comes to malicious compliance, Submariners are the apex predators. Why. you ask? Take individuals of above average intelligence, give them a job that is usually vastly above the normal training military gets (8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 2-3 years in duration..at least back in the day). Once the training is complete they go to a boat. When they get to said boat  the poor sods have to do their primary job, qualify watch stations (My rate got a 3 inch binder that was full of required qual cards) and do collateral duties. Simultaneously while doing  THAT they have to learn every system on the boat from bow to stern to become submarine qualified and earn their Dolphins (warfare pin). \n\nEvery.System.on.the.boat. Functionality, power supplies, pressures. Everything.\n\n So you have individuals who not only have to learn massive amounts of information, they also have to retain and draw on that knowledge on a daily basis. Back in the day there was a fairly high attrition rate on prospective Submariners.\n\nThe ones that made it through all that...well they got bored. That is bad.  It also does not help that in general, they are well....Jackasses by the standards of the rest of the Navy. In order to function in such a unique environment, leeway is given that the general military just cannot understand.  Which leads me, finally, to this.\n\nThis was shared with us from an instructor (later a good friend) at our base schoolhouse.\n\nWhen we would take tests, every time, the instructor would go through a spiel about what you could and could not do. The usual stuff: Blank sheet of paper, calculator (if needed), pencil type, fill in the bubbles, yatta yatta. and...No cheating. After hearing no cheating for the umpteenth time, one of us asked why in the hell would we need to be told not to cheat as that was pretty self evident. \n\nTurns out, it was because of Petty officer Blank (not real name). \n\nPetty officer blank got caught cheating. First offenses, depending on the severity, were usually met with a slap on the back of the head/warning from the instructor or having to take a trip to instructor territory to get a bit of you ass chewed off. This time was different. For whatever reason this instructor (not the instructor relating the story)  decided to make an example of Petty Officer Blank. Mast (NJP) was threatened, everyone would be made aware that ZERO TOLERANCE was in effect. By the standards of the day, this was considered excessive. \n\nThe ball starts rolling, disciplinary paperwork has started. Petty officer Blank is going to have a bad day. Through all this, PO Blank is calm to the point of boredom, which infuriates the offended instructor. Finally, PO Blank is standing in front of a review board of E-6s and E-7s as a step towards the real NJP and probable loss of all sorts of good things (pay, Paygrade, etc)..The following is dredged from my memory and is roughly what i remember:\n\nNJP Board Member: \"Are you aware why you are here today and the purpose of this review?\"\n\nPO Blank: \"yes I am\".\n\nNJP BM: \" You were found cheating on a test in class XXX on the X of X, XXXX.\"\n\nPO Blank:\" That is correct.\"\n\nNJP BM: \" You are aware of the potential consequences of this action? You realize that this is a mastable offence?\"\n\nPO Blank: \" I am aware that cheating is considered a mastable offense by this board. However, they are wrong.\"\n\nNJP BMs': \"Wrong? Howso? You had better be taking this seriously! GRAWR!\"\n\nPO Blank: \" After reading XXXINST holycrapthatsalotofnumbers, i have determined that nowhere does it explicitly state you are not allowed to cheat.\".\n\nNJP BMs: \".....what? That's \\*#!!ing impossible!\"\n\nPO Blank: \" It is not impossible and I have highlighted all the relevant areas of the instruction that pertain to conduct in class&gt;\"\n\n....And so on.\n\nIt was determined, reluctantly, that PO blank was correct. There was nothing in the instruction governing class conduct explicitly outlawing cheating. This was met with mixed disbelief and anger. However, As the instruction is the bible, they could not take him to mast. This did not stop them from chewing him out loud, high, and repeatedly; In addition to making sure he was under the microscope for the rest of that particular series of classes. The instruction was changed to outlaw all forms of cheating (excruciatingly spelled out) and the verbal warning \"Cheating is NOT ALLOWED!\" had to be issued before every test.\n\nThat was one of the best MC's i'd ever seen anyone pull off up to that point in my career. Of course, that was the beginning of a fairly long career in total...",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I think it works.\n\n\nThis happened a few years ago, a little after the automotive shop I work at opened. I was doing mostly GS work (oil change, tires, state inspections,) but my manager was also the owner of our two locations so he was constantly on the phone for sometimes hours at a time talking to business contacts. I often had to quickly switch from working on cars in the shop to helping customers up front and making them tickets if he was on the phone.\n\n\nWhen we first opened we had an agreement with a company that would go door to door selling coupon cards that featured both our locations. It included normal coupons like $34.95 off a conventional oil change, making it essentially free minus the fluid disposal fee, free alignment check, $X off a service more than $XX, you get the idea. We made ZERO dollars off these cards. The whole amount the customer paid for the card went straight to the salesman and the company running the promotion. We merely honored the discounts for some marketing. These were very common in our first few months so I knew how to handle them.\n\n\nThis gentleman walks in and my boss is on the phone. We will call the customer Mr. Never Happy. I stop the car I'm working on and go up front to greet and help him. Simple enough. He's asks for an oil change and shows me his coupon card that he's bought. He's bringing in a Honda Odyssey which takes a specific weight of oil that doesn't have a conventional grade for it. I politely tell him the situation, which he already knows since we did the same oil last time, and tell him he still gets the $34.95 discount and will just have to pay the difference. A little over $14 with tax I tell him. Still a great deal.\n\n\nMNH: No, I want the price from last time. It was cheaper. Give me that price.\n\n\nI check his history and turns out my boss took off his $3 fluid disposal fee from his last oil change. So with tax it was a little under $11. There's no notes as to why it was taken off and my boss is still on the phone so I can't ask him. We never take off the disposal fee and I have never heard my boss tell me any situation where we should. It's only $3 it can't be that big of a deal.\n\n\nMe: Well sit it looks like my manager took off the disposal fee last time. Doesn't say why. But it'll be only a little over $14 this time.\n\nMNH: No, I want to pay what I paid last time. I won't pay that. I want to talk to your manager.\n\n\nMy boss is sitting right behind me on the phone and MNH keeps pointing at him while demanding at me to speak with him. Seeing as he's becoming agitated I ask for his coupon card so I can see if there are any notes about taking the fee off for him, even though I know there won't be. In my inexperience I forgot to look at his card to see if it was expired before I told him the price of the oil change. The cards expire after a year and MNH's had expired well over a month ago. That's my bad. I told him he could use the card so I won't back out now, and maybe he'll be a bit more forgiving about the $3 if he knows he shouldn't be getting the $34.95 in the first place. \n\n\nMe: Well sir, this card actually expired over a month ago. I'll still give you the discount on the oil change, but it's going to include the disposal fee.\n\nMNH: No. That won't do. You can't help me. I want to speak to your manager right there! \n\n\nSo I give in. I tell him he can talk to him as soon as he gets off the phone and I stay up front to let my boss know the situation I'm sure he already understands since he was only a few feet away from us. A minute or so later he gets off the phone and asks the customer if he can help him.\n\n\nMNH: Yes I need my discount. Same as last time. \n\n\nMy boss asks to see his coupon card. Looks at it. And within seconds tells him how it is.   \n\n\nB: Sir your card is expired so the oil change is full price. $44.95 plus tax and disposal fees.\n\nMNH: But. Wait...\n\n\nMr. Never Happy looks at me for help, but I just put my head down and walk back out into the shop and keep working on my car. I gave you an out dude. But you couldn't bear paying an extra $3 so this is on you. Needless to say he leaves in a huff and I haven't seen him back since.\n\n\nTLDR; Customer comes in and demands a $3 discount on top of his expired coupon. When I tell him he can use his coupon, but not the extra so he asks for my manager. Manager tells him his coupon is expired and it's full price. \n\n\nedit; grammar\n\n",

        "text": "First time posting, on mobile, all that.\n\nFor the past few months my housemates and I have had a futon on our front porch. We all use it every day when we let out our dogs, smoke a cigarette, read a book, etc. Nowhere in any of our leases does it state we aren't allowed to have porch furniture and it has never been an issue until recently.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago we noticed that my roommates gaming chair had gone missing. This chair has been on the porch for at least a year without issue. Charles, one of the house mates, mentioned that our asshole landlord Mike (asshole for a variety of reasons, including not caring that we didnt have a working shower for 2 months) had taken it because he wanted to clean the porch. Cut to yesterday and now the entire futon is gone. No warning, verbal or written, was given to us about having to move the futon for cleaning so I messaged the landlord. The conversation went like this (I'm Me and AL is asshole landlord):\n\nMe: \"Hi Mike. Wondering if you'd like us to move our other belongings off/away from the porch? Assuming you're painting or something and that's why you removed our futon and chair; when do you think we will be getting those items back?\"\n\nAL: \"My note was for everyone to have there personal things off the porch and labeled in the basement. So I could have things cleaned up around there. Any thing left I said I would get rid of. I gave everyone a couple of weeks to do this. The city does not allow padded indoor furniture to be outside on the property. Your futon is in the shed. If you would like it back it needs to be inside your apartment.\"\n\nThere was no note left. For any one of the tenants in the 4-plex. The shed is pad locked with my futon held hostage inside it. Which was outside as it was my porch furniture at my last (small) apartment in this same city/county with no issue. Also notice he doesnt say where the chair has disappeared to.\n\nSo I called up the local city building inspector - Dan - and asked if there truly is a code about padded porch furniture. Dan asks who my landlord is and when I tell him Mike, Dan says he has gotten calls about this from Mike's tenants before. Dan also said that there isnt an official code, it's more something they try to enforce as upholstered indoor furniture being outside there's potential of it getting wet, which can cause mold. This I understand. I inform him that the deck is covered with a roof so it rarely gets wet, the pad is removable just like any other porch furniture, and I didnt see the issue. That's when Dan said: \"Hey, you've got an argument kid, use it. If you can remove and/or cover the pad so it doesn't get wet then I can make an exception. Tell your landlord you talked to Dan and if he has questions he can contact me.\" \n\nSo right now I'm devising a plan with my house mates. We are thinking if we pull the futon pad up behind the frame so its up against the house and cover it with plastic (like an old shower curtain) then we are in compliance with the city \"code\" and my asshole landlord will have to release my futon from being held hostage in his locked shed. Not entirely sure how to tackle the last bit of compliance but will update when it happens!\n\nTL;DR Asshole landlord takes my porch futon citing a city code that doesnt exist. City inspector helps me maliciously comply to get my futon back on the porch. To be continued.\n\nEdit: Compliance: completed. Futon is back in its rightful place with the mattress cover on it!\n\nNow how to tackle the fact that my bathroom light fixture is leaking water from rain runoff? 😒",

        "text": "Sorry, for formatting. I'm on mobile on my way to my vacation with family.\n\nBackstory - My first job was being a referee for Park District soccer at age 14. This was earlier this summer around right before school got out. This was my third u8 match. (Under 8) \nI let most minor fouls go as all the kids want to do is play and the parents haven't been mad.\nYou don't need to be a certified referee to referee park district but I am so I can referee club games\n\nSo I've started the game. Which is four 10 minute quarters. I'm doing this solo as most u8 matches are. The teams are fairly matched for once. Though one team has a player that gets really mad if he messes up the slightest (coach informed me about how it was mental. I still don't know) Lets call him AP. So if AP would lose the ball he would get furious and go in really hard into the player with the ball. Like studs up kind of tackle. Course I had to call something. Which I did.\n\nAfter repeat offenses I took him to the side during half time and talked to him and his coach. Coach explained and AP lessened up for the 3rd quarter. Now it being the 4 quarter AP starts going in hard but within the legal tackles. \n\nAt this point a female coach of the other team, let's call her FC starts telling me how to do my job. Saying why aren't you calling anything, etc\nI ignored her as that wasn't my problem. \n\nThe next weekend the owner of the Park District (lets call him PD) comes to me telling me FC emailed him saying I wasn't doing my job. PD likes me as he helped me fill the paperwork to work their and told me what he recommends me to do and what a senior ref I know does. I explain im doing everything he told me.\n\nThe day goes on and I'm getting ready for my 2nd u8 match when FC comes walking up. 10 minutes later I get the game started. I call absolutely every foul. No matter how minor it is. Obviously upsetting parents, kids, and the coaches. Especially FC. In the end her team loses because one do their players fouled the other team in their box resulting in a penalty kick being scored in the last 10 seconds. \n\nFC comes up to me asking why I called all the things. Getting visibly angry. I tell her that I know about the email she sent PD and this was how I corrected my mistake. She never complained again and I went back to my minimalist foul calling style.\n\nTL:DR I get yelled at by crazy coach for not calling anything and call every minor thing for the next game of hers",

        "text": "When I was in college, I had an absolute asshole as a Comp Sci teacher. The man was ancient, he helped write some of the original code for the first computer-based telecom systems in the US, but he could NOT teach. He had a photographic memory, and could essentially code in his head - he taught with the expectation that we could do the same, and anyone that couldn't was just being lazy.\n\nAdditionally, he HATED the requirement to have office hours, and he did so whenever he thought that people wouldn't be able to attend - namely, at 2, 3 AM (Unannounced) ... since Comp Sci students could get into the Comp Sci building at any hour of the day, he technically complied with the requirement to have his hours when the building was open.\n\nI realized that he was doing this when I saw his office light on from my Dorm room window in the middle of the night. He refused to say in advance when his hours would be (Since he wasn't contractually obligated to do so, he was technically in compliance.)\n\nAt this point, I was absolutely furious - I'd spoken with the Dept head / the dean, and my class size was down to ~5 people, the rest had dropped. After a few weeks of this, I was ready to do absolutely anything to force this man to do his fucking job. He couldn't escape the requirement to have his office hours IN his office, so it was just a matter of time until I managed to pin him down.\n\nI decided to camp outside his office and request that he explain every last thing I didn't understand from his \"lecture.\" I did this nightly until I caught him - I almost gave the man a heart attack when I rolled out from beneath the bench in the hallway outside his office in my sleeping bag, laptop / notes in hand.\n\nThe next time I came upstairs to that hallway, all benches had been pushed to the end of the hall. The offices on that floor had no locks, so next time... I hid inside behind his door to wait, studying on my PDA (This was before smartphones, The Motorola Razr was the 'big thing' at the time.)\n\nAfter the ass realized he wasn't going to escape me, he just started holding office hours during the actual workday.\n",
