        "text": "Quick note: This is not gonna be a short, little, and fun post about someone claiming mother Sanskrit is inherently better, or that Kalaw Lagaw Ya has a better understanding of \"last night\" because they have a tense marker for that. This is more ideological.\n\n**Background on the Book**\n*The Trouble With Diveristy* is a book by Walter Benn Michaels. It is a political book, that is mainly a critique of neoliberalism, and focusing on identity over economic disparity. I was assigned it for a seminar class on race, but the majority of the book has nothing to do with linguistics. However, chapter 5, \"Who are we? Why should we care?\" gets into the issue at hand.\n\n**The Bad Stuff**\n\nMichaels is criticizing culture and identity throughout the book, so it is no surprise that he found a bone to pick with language studies. \n\nHe starts the chapter off with some overall good linguistics: he agrees that all languages are inherently equal and can all convey the same information, albeit in different ways. He even agrees that based on this principle, it is wrong to demand a person give up a language in favor of another. \n\nThen he reaches his conclusion: that just as we shouldn't force another to speak our language, we should also agree that there is no downside to losing the majority of the world's languages. \n\n**Why it's bad linguistics**\n\nThis isn't a new idea, and probably most of us who study linguistics have had discussions with people about the importance (or unimportance) of linguistic diversity. And I agree with some of his points. That in a few generations, no one is at a disadvantage for not speaking their \"cultural-heritage\" language.\n\nHowever, he states towards the end, \n&gt;No one (not even the theorists who defend them) can possibly--or maybe I should say, coherently--care whether [languages] survive.\n\nThis is the point I disagree with fundamentally. And my disagreement isn't about cultural value of diversity, or the cultural knowledge and art that we can lose with the loss of a language. Frankly, I don't think Michaels cares about that. My disagreement instead comes against the idea that language diversity has no value besides diversity for diversity's sake.\n\nLinguistic theory, no matter what framework is being used, benefits from a plethora of data. Our understanding of how language works in the mind (or in the anatomy) is constantly being challenged by data from languages all around the world, many of them threatened. On this point, there are hundreds upon hundreds of languages that are poorly documented at all, not to mention potential languages that were [overlooked in the literature.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/07/583931629/linguists-discover-previously-unidentified-language-in-malaysia) \n\nThis, however, is not the only academically important reason for linguistic diversity. After all, if some magic database were created, and every living speaker of a language were to donate a couple thousand hours of audio, wouldn't it be ok if languages were to go extinct?\n\nI say no. Just as there is a lot of data to be obtained from languages as they exist today, there is also information to get from the interaction of languages. Research on the development of creoles and how that happens can't possibly benefit from the loss of most of the world's languages. Losing the possibility of a potential Circassian-Hawaiian (wouldn't that be exciting?) creole is \nnot something that should be celebrated.\n\nAlso, as Michaels points out, languages are not static. So even if we have this magic database, we're still going to get more information in the future. Isn't it important to have several thousand baselines that people can innovate and change over time? Sure we'd get interesting English dialect innovations to be researched, but isn't that less rich than information on thousands of languages, starting at vastly different points?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMichaels, and others who propose that loss of linguistic diversity, aren't wrong on the factual side. However, their view is *inherently* bad, or anti-linguistics, because they are okay with the loss of immeasurable data that can benefit our own understanding of language, the brain, and social interaction.",

Anglish is mostly Theedish. But English is also mostly French. Anglish either birthed OVERENGLISH or unfolded alongside it (I don't do speechcraft of yore, and it's still an open frain). We all know Anglish is but English speakers fanding to speak more Theedish, so it just ends up spoken like your youth-learner Old-english teaching. But in OVERENGLISH a freestanding happening befell. OVERENGLISH was, in the beginning, wholly mean English while also casting out the french words that had been brought into it. So by a held back reckoning (since English is about half French), by cleansing out the un-English words from English. OVERENGLISH is at least 110% Theedish, if not more.\n\nNeedless to say, the finding of OVERENGLISH wiped away a lot of beliefs that speechlorers held to be markedly true. How could English become the most Theedish of all spoken tongues on the earth by only shifting some words here and there (you know, the 99.9% we don't brook) and shaped a fremd work of a kind of inbetweenish mindreading?\n\nYou see, brainbeseeching tell us that OVERENGLISH speakers have at least three speech-layers. Opensightly there's mean English, which is a wrought blend, an unbegotten, if you will, of Anglish, French, and Norse. That's one layer. Then there's the spoken/sung/quoth/throat-sung/whispered/Sprechstimmed side of the the tongue. On the barely spoken level, OVERENGLISH has at least as much spoken richness as Ithkuil, but it also has all the loftiness and might of a unbending tongues like Chinese.\n\n",

        "text": "https://www.thelocal.no/20160701/norway-drinking-culture-fylleangst-drunk-anxiety\n\nThis quirky cultural factoid / edgy op-ed piece is by an American author (of course) who lightheartedly critizes illiberal Norwegian alcohol laws. \n\nR4: The author states that the term *fylleangst* (a sort of post-inebriation anxiety) \"does not exist in any other culture or language\". She ties this to the fact that the sensation is so frequent and closely tied to Norwegian drinking culture that it necessitates its own term, just like the \"Eskimos have over 300 variations to describe the word snow\". \n\nBonus pedantry: speaking as an equally repressed Swede, I can attest that we have a similar word for the exact same thing.
