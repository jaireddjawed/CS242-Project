        "text": "Hey y'all. This is my first post ever here so I hope I'm not breaking any rules.\n\nI have a vanilla Steam Deck. On it I very recently downloaded a very recent AAA quacked game. I usually use Lutris to run my games - same for this game. I checked the depots of the game and installed as many as I could. It requires VC 2019, Directx 10, MS .NET 4.6. I could install all except MS. NET. In Winetricks I tried all the versions and none would install.\n\nI then tried to run the game and I get the error in the title \"Windows 10 or later is required to run the game\". It's the first game to show me this error.\n\nAnybody here has any idea why this could be and what would the solution be to fix this?\n\nThanks a lot everyone!",

Pretty much, I was kinda left in a desert not knowing anything here and there. I actually liked Hyprland with the animations and the support for multiple monitors since that's my setup on my main machine, but I really didn't like the fact that the packages aren't on fedora yet, I'm sure they will be sooner or later though.\n\nwhat tips do you have for me to start and not be just left hanging not knowing what to do in a window manager what do you recommend me to start with. and what can help with dual monitor setups and Nvidia Drivers and be the most good looking potentially yet becomes actually functional in terms of use for development mostly. and have a unified look and feel(Kinda like gnome now).",

        "text": "These custom kernels clearly have something to offer, but how do they all score regarding supply chain attacks, code review, and public person project leads?\n\nThere isn't a whole lot to be found by searching for 'code review', 'contributor policy', 'code security', etc. for each name.\n\nNow, these are niche-within-niche pieces of software.  Most people don't run Linux and most Linux systems use stock distro kernels.  They won't be targeted as much as popular server installs or outlook.  Still, we've seen lots of supply chain attacks in the silliest of places lately, niche npm, python etc. packages have been targeted rather massively (both directly and with namedupes), and people trying (and succeeding) to backdoor linux distros and kernels is not unheard of either.  While it's a target with a low headcount, the kernel is a very high value target, eg. for a botnet operation it would be worth the effort.  Slipping your evil code into something running close to metal on just 1000 computers worldwide can pay off well enough to be worth the trouble.\n\ntldr; while I don't think these kernels are top contender targets, they're also not unlikely targets.\n\nI did a bit of basic searching to look for stuff like code reviews, policies, project statements, contribution requirements or policies, etc.  Didn't find much yet, but a quick look at the github pages for Liquorix and Xanmod:\n\nLiquorix: 4 contributors\n\nXanmod: 13,000+ contributors\n\nObviously Xanmod doesn't have 13k+ people contributing to every update, but it does give an idea of how many fingers are in the pie.  Liquorix only lists 4 people, so it's a bit easier to get a grasp of who's doing what.  A public figure gives you someone answering for the commits, anonymous or non-proven/non-vetted contributors don't have to answer for themselves and can simply abandond the account if caught doing something unacceptable.\n\nBeyond this, distros like Arch and Gentoo have their own ports of these things, and I *assume* they do a little homework before including a new kernel in their repository, so using these would presumably offer some level of 'review'.\n\nIt'd be nice to see a discussion about this.\n\nThoughts?

        "text": "I'm thinking about software documentation, including tutorials. Let's say a piece of software is used in several places,  then a change happens to it. Is there a way to link or connect the the downstream software to the upstream one so that when a potentially software-breaking change happens upstream, an annotation or a comment or a notification is sent warning of the change? \n\nHere are two completely hypothetical examples, I'm just using my imagination here. Rust is used to write a part of a new Linux kernel, after finishing the Rust code, it is uploaded into a change management system that adds metadata to all the Rust language features used. Later on, Mozilla for some reason changed something about the language, this change is then inputted into a system that sends a warning notification about the changed features. Our change management system picks up that the change is relevant to our kernel code. Now a maintainer of the kernel can look and see what version of Rust downstream changed what features in so and so lines of the kernel code. \n\nAnother example, Python is used to make a scientific desktop app, with the app itself enabling the use of python. A scientist uses the app and writes code for a specific application then makes a youtube tutorial explaining the code. He then uploads the code and the video to our change management system. A few years later, a new python version comes out that changes features relevant to our scientist, so he receives warning notifications at specific locations in his code as well specific minutes:seconds of his youtube video where those features were discussed. \n\nDo you think something like this could be of value? Does something like this exists?",
