Even if you don’t know Latin roots for numbers, repeated 8’s (oct-) and 4’s (tetr-), plus a standalone 10 (dec-) in combination with another ten in 18, are enough to figure out the structure of octadeca- and extrapolate to octatetra- and tetranona-. From these data, -cont- seems to be used for numbers above 20 with no apparent extra meaning.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) The numbers follow a rather straightforward rule of H-number = C-number \\* 2 + 2.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) Having numbers for eight, nine, and ten, we can compare them to the names of the months and see that October has it’s name derived from 8/oct-, and December from 10/dec-, making November a logical derivative of 9/non-, despite only the partial match. Therefore, the original numbering system started two month later than today, and the first month was March.!&lt;",

        "text": "Sorry for a potentially stupid question, but I'm a curious layman and ever since I had this thought yesterday it's been bothering me.\n\nOK so, in English we say \"I enjoy this or that,\" right? But if you look at other words with the \"en-\" prefix, it becomes clear that \"enjoy\" is pretty weird -- as far as enjoyment goes, the subject and object seem like they're reversed. That is, if something \"enlivens\" a party, *it* is giving life to the party; if someone \"entraps\" an animal, *they* are trapping the animal; if something emboldens you (I think em- is just a variant of en-, right?), \\*it\\* gives you boldness; so if something gives you joy, shouldn't it be that \\*it\\* enjoys you?\n\nEnglish is, of course, a notoriously inconsistent and silly language with more exceptions than rules, so I guess this shouldn't be a surprise. But it inspired (is in- a variant?) a bunch of questions in me.  Is there an archaic usage of \"enjoy\" that follows the rule consistently? When, how, or why did it change? What's up with the \"en-\" (or em- or in- etc) prefix anyway, where does it come from and how does it usually work? Or am I mixing up vastly different things -- if so, please set me straight!\n\nThanks in advance for your answers, I'm sure they will enjoy me greatly.",

I assume that the student is using a screen reader, but I'm going to ask them later on to be sure. Still, I have some practical questions about teaching morphology specifically.\n\n* Can screen readers read special characters used in linguistics (e.g. IPA, various latin-based orthographies)? If not, what can I do to make them more accessible?\n* What about interlinear glosses – vertical alignment of morphemes and gloss is rather important to understand them. Is there any option to make them accessible?\n* I initially planned to do exercises on segmenting, allomorphic variation and the like during class which usually involve the students looking at a data set and finding patterns there.

        "text": "TL;DR; Had this idea for an AI experiment where you are essentially training the 'organisms' to find a way to communicate with eachother rather than eg. [moving](https://youtu.be/GOFws_hhZs8?t=197)\n\nWasn't able to find anything searching, seemingly because of other much more popular areas of computational ling, but also because I am not really sure how to search for this? I get [this kind of thing](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Models_of_Speech_Production) instead.\n\nI am non-technical, this is not a CS sub, and there is an easy way to explain what I mean:\n\nImagine please a cube shaped prison cell:\n\n* On the floor is a randomly generated(/selected?) square image('need'). \n* In the ceiling is a chute that can dispense food and chalk. \n* On each vertical wall are two square magic chalk boards, one of which you can draw on yourself ('outgoing'), one of which it seems the prisoner in the next cell over can draw on ('incoming').\n* At the start of each day, every prisoner gets a stick of chalk.\n* At the end of each day, food is distributed to each prisoner, *according to how closely the images drawn on the 'incoming' chalk boards in their cell resemble the image on the floor.*\n* Any prisoners that starved to death are replaced with new prisoners with a new image.\n\n[I just chose images because neural nets are good at it, there are many free AI image comparison tools.]\n\nIt seems that the prisoners must either find a way to get their neighbours to approximate their image or starve to death, so it seems that eventually they must develop some kind of 'langage'... and this prison would be very easy to model for those who know AI.\n\nSo... does anyone know where I can find similar tests? Has it been done? Is it trivial and pointless?\n\nThe bit I find really interesting is considering the further specifics of the test, for example: \n\n* Should the prisoners have unlimited chalk? \n* Should the prisoners be assumed good enough at drawing to simply copy their 'need' image onto each 'outgoing' each day?\n* Do the prisoners have unlimited time to stare at their incomings?\n* Should the prisoners be able to draw nothing?\n* Should the prisoners have any kind of from-'birth' interpretational matrix? Should they have one for each prisoner?\n\nEg. at first I thought that you would have to limit chalk supply in order to get anything more sophisticated than: 'each day I draw my need on each outgoing' but even if we imagine no matrices, unlimited chalk, perfect drawing/looking: shouldn't we expect statements with similar... functions to the following to appear?:\n\n* \"I have enough food from other neighbours, describe your needs.\"\n* \"This section of my outgoing describes my need, this section of my outgoing describes what I think your need is.\"\n* \"I am starving, I have no time to discuss your need at this time.\"\n* \"You can't speak at all, be quiet and I will teach you how to communicate your needs to your neighbours.\"\n\nHope this is appropriate for the sub. As non-technical non-linguist it didn't feel appropriate to post in /cs or /compling, and I figure it would be the linguists to ask before the cs people, because the implementation afai can understand is pretty trivial once you have figured out what specifics/parameters you want.\n\n[Please feel free to do whatever you want with this, anyone.]",

This is where I’m really struggling, as the class really focuses more on independent work with minimal instruction (not great cause it’s a beginner course with a very basic prerequisite).

My main focus is the Medieval Celtic languages (Old Irish and Middle Welsh/Breton), to see if it'd be possible to reconstruct a 'Proto-Insular-Celtic' idiom, or to see what cultural similarities might come about because of these idioms/proverbs.\n\nTo this, I also will need to look into Old English, Old Norse and Latin due to the fact that I know proverbs and idioms can spread throughout languages fairly easily. I've found Piirainen's two volume study, *Lexicon of Common Figurative Units: Widespread Idioms in Europe and Beyond*, and it's interesting, but was wondering if anything else has been written on comparative phraseology. I figure something must have been, especially in IE languages. \n\nI haven't read it yet, but I am aware of *How to Kill a Dragon*, which seems (from the introduction) like it might touch on something similar, so would be interested to hear about that too.\n\nI appreciate any feedback y'all could give, or pointers in the right direction for more readings. I can answer any questions you have about the idea as well.",

        "text": "Still, a lot of elder professors believe in the existence of the Altaic family and the classification of Korean into that family. Briefly, the description of the Altaic family used in current Korean linguistics is \"It is too hasty to oppose the Altaic family because there is not enough research proving Korea does not belong to the Altaic family. Anti-Altaic scholars should prove that the similarities between Northern Asian languages and Korean language are caused by borrowing or contact of languages and that the borrowing or contact occurred systematically across a wide range of regions and languages.\"   \n\n\nSeoul University, which is the top university in Korea, has The Altaic Society of Korea and continues to claim Korean should be classified as one of the Altaic family. Other places are similar to the situation of Seoul University.   \n\n\nKorean linguists still cling to the Altaic family theory in spite of the global trend of anti-Altaic. Probably, I think they reject admitting their predecessors who laid the foundation of Korean linguistics were wrong or feel afraid of rebuke by the public. A famous Korean linguistic Youtuber uploaded a video about \"Peninsula-Japonic is valid enough\" and a lot of people wrote comments that the Youtuber is pro-Japanese or an amateur who does not know linguistics well. And even, there was a comment saying why the theory name contains \"Japonic,\" not \"Korean,\" which got quite many likes. Due to those intense reactions, he deleted that video. Though Peninsula Japonic theory is not completely accepted by every linguist, I could not understand the reaction of the public on that topic which does not distinguish science from nationality. I think Korean linguists are too conservative, which was criticized by Alexander Vovin as well. They are reluctant to admit \"they did wrong\" and to adopt new theories. Most scholars in Korea prefer the Altaic family and there are only a few scholars who challenge it or claim it skeptical.   \n\n\nLee Ki-Moon and Lim Hong-Bin who are honorary professors of Seoul University, other elder Korean linguists, and their followers claim that Korea belongs to Altaic though the comparative method has not yet shown to everyone’s satisfaction that Korean is related to Altaic. I think the influence of elder scholars still exists, which makes it hard to challenge the Altaic family theory in current. \n\nI know there are Korean scholars who oppose the Altaic family but unfortunately, it is true that a number of scholars have a strong belief in the relationship between the Korean and the Altaic family. I was shocked not only at the professors who adhere to Altaic which is challenged a lot nowadays but also at the public who are obsessed with the anti-Japanese mindset.   \n\n\nI just wrote it for complaining about the reality of Korean linguistics.",
