I loved that a lot of important things weren't explicitly stated, which I think made everything so much more... tragic? Like Jake's injury, his love for Brett, and her love back to him but her refusal to be with him, etc. I picked up A Farewell to Arms and I'm excited to read that, any other authors/book recommendations that are similar to this style? \n\nAlso I would love to read other people's thoughts/interpretations on the book! \n\nI feel like Brett is a character I would normally hate, like how she seems to use Jake only when it fits her best interests. But for some reason I don't hate her... I think she really loves Jake but can't be with him because of her trauma from the war. I think it goes beyond just him not being able to have sex or \"please\" her; I think she is scared to be with someone that she can't use sex as a means to keep him, and she's deeply insecure and believes that men won't stay with her or love her without sex. But at the same time, she knows that sex isn't synonymous with love, which is why she pushes everyone away except Jake. For some reason, this makes me not dislike her. Also, the fact that Jake loves her and will drop everything for her when he knows she won't be with him because of his injury is just so heartbreaking. His self-awareness of this almost makes it more upsetting. Hemingway does such a good job of breaking your heart and making their relationship *so* tragic without even focusing on it or explaining it.",

And of course this novel was Robert Bloch's \"Psycho\" which was adapted by the king of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. Never saw the film but I have read, and finished, the novel, published in 1959 (film came out in the sixties).\n\nThe plot of this story is very familiar to all who have either saw the film or read the book. It centers around a strange man named Norman Bates who runs a motel in the middle of nowhere and lives with his domineering mother in a house behind it.\n\nNorman loves his mother dearly. But there is one problem; she's been dead for years. Or at least that's what some people say. But for Norman himself, that isn't really the case. When a beautiful woman comes to the hotel and rents a room, Norman spies on her while she undresses. But unbeknownst to him his mother is watching him. And she's not happy.\n\nRobert Bloch was, as many fans of fiction know, was one of the writers of the golden of pulp magazines. This novel is one of his best known, and most famous, works. Plus the story was inspired by the real life crimes of Ed Gein who lead a dual life (A mention of him is featured at the end of the book). Bloch also published two sequels to it, but as the adage goes, the first is always the best!",

Books are pretty and the smell good, and I do reread my favourites often.\n\nFor reasons, I do most of my book shopping online and I prefer to buy second hand if I can. It's not just the lower price, it just seems like the right thing to do with everything I purchase. Especially when it comes to older books that have been out a long time. For example I was just looking for Stephen King's The Stand. \n\nThat being said, I always fumble about between different online stores looking for a particular book. I've yet to land on a particular site that's really good for buying 2nd hand in Australia. Many are overseas and once you do the conversion and add the postage, it'd be cheaper to buy new from Dymocks.\n\nAny recommendations?",

I would hate to see what would happen if these people found out about horror. I'm glad you like the classics. I do too. I'm sorry you read Harry Potter and didn't like it. I don't either. But you can't dismiss an entire genre of off two or three examples that don't fit your tastes. Genres are wide enough to be more than one thing. There's going to be something that appeals to you in every genre, I'm certain. It's a wonder why you never hear these people talk about GRRM or Abercrombie or Tolkien or, hell, even Phillip Pullman! His dark materials fits into the category of children's to ya fantasy and is a very highly regarded modern classic! I can understand if you don't think that you'll enjoy the genre, but don't be such an asshole about it! If you try hard enough I'm sure you can bring yourself down off of you high horse to read an author that isn't Tolstoy Proust or Melville. Calm down and read watership down or something, jeez.",

When reading it, I kept thinking to myself how it would be the perfect story for a 5 episode Amazon or Apple TV+ miniseries (I don't think it would fit in the current crop of shows HBO makes). It has all the components of an easy adaptation. It has a small but varied enough main cast with some good side characters. It's a suspense drama that'll keep people tuning in, but it's not an action book so there are no huge action setpieces that are hard to do on a streaming series budget. Since it's about an airplane manufacturer, that's a great excuse to have a bunch of expensive-looking fake planes in various states of construction to make an impressive set. The book's not too long either so you could get in and out pretty easily in a limited-run series. Chrichton's writing has more than proven itself to work as a screenplay as well.\n\nHave any of you read it, and do you agree with my take? Are there any other books you read that you think would make great movie/series adaptations?",

        "text": "Apologize if this sub is more meant for talking about the stories inside the books, rather than the books themselves, but recently I heard about the story by Harlan Ellison \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\" and was really interested in reading it. However, upon searching for it everywhere online, it seems impossible to get ahold of for less than $100.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen a nonfiction work that wasn't a first edition or something cost this much, especially a paperback, so I was perplexed. What is it about this particular story, or set of stories, that makes it worth so much more? Is the demand just astronomically high? It also makes me wonder what it would be like if this was the norm. If it was typical for books to cost so much that the average person didn't have access to them. I will try to check my library but I don't think the odds are in my favor of them having it in stock at this point. \n\nBut I was just curious, does anyone know why this paperback is so expensive? I see reviews of people having read this book like they didn't just pay the equivalent of a small car payment just to read it and find it strange no one else is talking about this. Maybe I'm just ignorant and it is more normal than I realize for books to cost so much. Thank you.",

        "text": "Whether she’s narrating bickering families, quiet proclamations of love, or juicy chatter, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as though it was written just for you. \n\nJane Austen is loved mainly as a guide to fashionable life in the Regency period, but her vision of her task was radically different. She was an ambitious and stern moralist. She was acutely conscience of human failings and wanted, through her novels, to make people less selfish and more reasonable. More dignified, and sensitive to the needs of others. \n\nJane Austen was born in 1775 to an Anglican clergyman and his wife; Jane was the second youngest of eight children. And her father farmed and took in students to make ends meet. Jane was mostly taught at home and sometimes she wasn’t taught at all, although she and her sister did go to a year or two of boarding school. When she was eleven, Jane started writing plays and novels, mostly social satires and parodies of “novels of sensibility,” a literary genre in which women like, cry, sigh, and faint a lot. \n\nAusten grew up in a small village in Hampshire, where her father was the Anglican rector. They had high social status but were not well off. She lived in the social circles found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education and provided space for her to write and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. \n\nElements of her circumstances can be found in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. She did much of her writing at a tiny octagonal table. Many of these early works were in the style of the epistolary novel, which is a story composed of letters. We also see some echoes of this in Austen’s life. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married, on a couple of occasions, she was tempted. \n\nAnd after her father’s death in 1805, her financial position and the positions of her mother and her sister became increasingly insecure. By 1816, four of her books had been published. And she was working on a new novel, called Sanditon, when she died in 1817, at the age of just 41. Two more of her works, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, were published after her death. Her novel feels like every single word in it is genuinely essential. \n\nHer dry wit and cheeky playfulness inform her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers with a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully wicked friend Jane. Her writings contained sly satires of society, civility, and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England.\n\nFrom resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style of writing so popular at the time. \n\nInstead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, friendly jokes, and not-so-friendly barbs about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, and small talk. \n\nAs Mr. Bennet jokes to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between the mythical quest for love and the economic benefits of making a match. \n\nThe savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums this up in \"Mansfield Park;\" “I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves away.” \n\nUnsurprisingly, these themes were also present in Austen’s personal life. These headstrong heroines provide an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. \n\nLike the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet of \"Pride and Prejudice,\" whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives blinds her to a clumsy suitor. \n\nOr the iron-willed Anne Elliot of \"Persuasion,\" who chooses to remain unmarried after the disappearance of her first love. \n\nAnd Elinor Dashwood fiercely protects her family at the cost of her desires in \"Sense and Sensibility.\" \n\nThese women all encounter difficult choices about romantic, filial, and financial stability, and they resolve them without sacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters are far from perfect. They often think they have all the answers. \n\nAnd by telling the story from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing their heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under the protagonist and the reader. \n\nIn \"Emma,\" the titular character feels surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control as she thinks – in life or love. \n\nAnd Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the inconsistency of all human characters.” \n\nShe doesn't tell us why her sense of priorities is important, instead, she shows us a story that will also make us laugh, which can grip us enough that we want to finish supper early to read on. Upon finishing one of the novels, we're invited to go back into the world and respond to others as she has taught us. \n\nTo pick up on, and recoil from greed, arrogance, and pride, and to be drawn to the goodness within ourselves and others. Sadly, the moral ambition of these novels has largely disappeared in the modern world, yet it's the best thing that any novel can do. \n\nThe satisfaction we feel when reading Jane Austen is really because she wants the world to be a certain way and we find that immensely appealing.\n\nTheir complexity has kept Austen prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable for modern sensibilities, and hopes they continue to do so. It's the secret, the largely unrecognized reason why she is such a loved writer.",

Now is the key. \n\nWhen you become involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other person's position. \n\nForgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there. Will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender.\n\nWhen egos come together, whether in personal relationships or in an organization or institution, \"bad\" things will happen sooner or later. \n\nMost of the so-called bad things that happen in people's lives are due to unconsciousness. They are self-created, or rather ego created. I sometimes refer to those things as \"drama\". When you are fully conscious, the drama does not come into your life anymore.\n\nIt is saying, in fact, that you need time- that you need to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before you be free or complete. \n\nGive attention to the present, give attention to your behavior, to your reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears, and desires as they occur in the present.",

        "text": "I first read Slaughterhouse Five when I was a pre-teen in the early 1970’s. I thought it was just a weird sci-fi romp and was just pretentious surrealism like much of the art of that period. I recently re-read it at 65 and it finally dawned on me that the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, was lost in a PTSD induced psychosis trying to deal with the horrors he had experienced in WW II. I wonder what else I’ve missed from all the literature I’ve read because of my age and extent of experience when I read it!",
