        "text": "Just saw this on Day9's play through of the Nova Missions where he does extremely badly.\n\nNova is a highly trained 'Ghost', a cloaked assassin equipped with the most advanced exosuit, allowing her super strength and reflexes.\n\nA mission from the Emperor sends Nova to a city infested with feral Zerg, insect like alien creatures with no regard for their own safety and able to reproduce at incredible speeds.\n\nA base is set up with troops of Marines, power suited fearless soldiers, the best of Terran technology, including Liberators, spacecraft capable of sieging land units. Workers in Space Construction Vehicles mine and channel the valuable minerals and vespene gas to build the army.\n\nThe first days went well, with Nova leading, the troops braced against waves of zerg flung against them, Nova learns more about the city and what happens to it.\n\nSeveral days later, the troops are at full strength and Nova is only left with a few sites to investigate. Unexpectedly, a huge wave of Zerg descend upon the main base while the force is fighting outside. As they rush back to the base, the forces dwindle as bad coordination leads to stragglers being picked off one by one. Nova herself is almost killed, but a teleport to base saves her from critical injury.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire base is razed, except for a few workers and the Command Center which manage to escape by using rockets to float above the surface, they are extremely vulnerable to flying Zerg now. Nova orders her CC to hide in the shadows, there would be no way to complete the mission now it seems.\n\nUnless.\n\nNova realised, she had a permanent cloaked suit and had no need for food or water for months. If she could only get to the last goal, they could get off the planet. So she began, slowly dismantling the Zerg biostructures and taking out the wandering troops guerrilla style. She took special care to snipe Zerg Overseers, who are capable of seeing through the invisibility.\n\nDay by day she wore down the Zerg base, destroying a building here, killing a few units there, what little survivors the Terran had just hid or attacked from range, helping where they could.\n\nAfter what seems like eternity, Nova won a war, with attrition. Exhausted from days of endless fighting and running, she finally entered the building where the records were kept, here she would learn the truth.",

        "text": "\"Too much BDSM\" \n\nWe are a new group, first time DM and all my players it's their first time playing, we are about 10 sessions deep now, and few people seemed interested in our shenanigans when I asked for advice on various boards so here is our Ch1 tell me what ya think. \n\nThis is a young world built by a war of the gods, the world is so young that there's are some elves that remember their birth, and seeing the war between the gods shaping the ground before them. Time has passed and the gods have been gone for thousands of years. The continent Therroseed is connected peacefully by the High King Anoll III: but 70 years ago a terrible storm forces inland and submerged the Capitol kingdom so deeply that the land is now called the new sea, nearly separating the continent leaving only two small land bridges far north and far south. Civil War Erupts between The High Elves, The Dwarves, the Dragonborn, and the Brokensheilds, (a mix or races from Human, to Tiefling, to Orc). Every group is clawing for control of the land bridges and the right of their Army to rise as the New Rulers of Therroseed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCharacters\n\nFighty Mc FightFace: Fighter: a human soldier, with a past so bloody he's forced even himself to forget. All he really knows is he loves a good fight.\n\nNym: Rogue: a dark elf street rat, a simple street urchin, never knowing his parents and the only thing of his past being a strange emblem.\n\nChulo: Sorcerer: A tiefling who has Grown up on a Tiefling reservation, this 4 foot 8 green fire cracker loves to shoot his mouth of with a forebolt\n\n\"Treeman Von Treeman\":Paladin: A mysterious Wilden who left their secluded island. This strong paladin plans to enjoy the worldly pleasures on his first trip from home.\n\nGrundle Steamdick: Druid: Of the dwarven Steamdick clan of Pen Island these dwarves deny their subterranean skills and are master sailors. Grundle travels the world in search of great wisdom.\n____________________________________________________\nCh 1\n      The soldier fighty MC Fight Face IE Fights is standing at the gates of a marvelous city known as Fox's Peak, on the summons of a letter from \"D\" requesting the help of great heros with promises of their greatest desire. The two rude guards greet fights stating he must wait for his other companions. Each recipient of the letter from \"D\" delivered by a scorched raven being to arrive shortly. The stoic tree man who never so much as gave his name approaches the gate and shares a glance with Fights and little words with the guards and takes a seat. Then the green skinned tiefling enters and IMMEDIATELY picks a fight with the snarky guard promptly getting put in his place with a few half handed punches. The next to enter is Nym a mysterious dark elf that just barely gives a glance to the other travelers and takes a seat himself. Finally enters Grundle of the steamdick's with the only friendly greeting to the group of \"HI\".\n\n   The guards trick the Tiefling into handing over 300 gold to enter the city. With some intimidating and title throwing Fights gets the group in 250 gold cheaper. The group Marvels at the city's golden tiles, and beautiful architecture before tracking to the bar to see where to start on this \"D\" character. Our tiefling gets chair slammed by a powerful wizard that he attempted to shoot his mouth off to while Steamdick steals himself a pint of local ale. After asking through the tavern they learn that the Lord of this town goes by Lord D, so they seem to have found their man. They enter the throne room to find a strange light ritual to show the entire town the induction of the \"hero's to be\". After they prove themselves as brave men they are told to help the town's people until their great mission is assembled. The group meets a scared and worried weak looking man Dororboras who has lost his daughter to a \"floating man\". They set off after a little preparation to Eye Tower.\n\n      After seeing caravans ransacked and destroyed they happen across one sitting in a feild Fights and Our Tiefling investigate the one wagon and are jumped by a group of gnolls needing the rest of their  remaining group to aid them in dispatching the gnolls while fights has a long bare knuckle brawl with a lone gnoll. Finally they find Eye Tower the place that their damsel is taken. Before them is a giant stone face of a  Cyclopse with a piercing in the left ear and the nose. After thought and ALOT of trial and error Nym discovers a golden ring on a flower pot and Pierce's the right ear. The temple opens to them. Only to be attacked by a group of Dretches. They were not taken seriously and throught to be weak they show our team the first down on Nym. They recover and move to the next trial \"One May Pass, All others will fall\" so, clearly 3 try to go at the same time and the floor folds out from under them and They fall to the pit of a gold crazy Nothic. After a quick scuffle with fights the group assembles and defeats the beast however the gold of the room turns to stone and Nym, who had lined his pockets is clearly upset. The final trial awaits as the group must enter a room with their screaming damsel surrounded by bones begging for help. However our tiefling doesn't trust the girl and lights that poor girl on fire like she ain't shit and she just screams louder in the corner. Then a Goliath of a skeleton Minotaur rises. Fights quickly flips into action cracking it's skull but is quickly downed by a friendly Thunderclap from Chulo and a swift charge by the Minotaur . The team is dwindling slowly being cut down by the various skeletons popping up from the piles of bones and hope is dim. Nym takes a poor shot at a skeleton and missing finishing off the poor girl in the corner with one last arrow, all hope seems lost. BUT with the aid of Grundle and the battle prowess of Treeman cutting the Minotaur down with massive damage at the legs of a beast, the trial is cleared. The girls body disappears in fights hands they loot the room to find a deep swirling orb and a simple stone key and I guess it's back to Fox Peak to figure out the mystery.\n\n      They find a disgusting decrepit town. WHAT?! Time Travel? Trickery? Alternate dimensions? A strange wizard helps them identify their artifacts as keys to the gods and that their letter had made this town different to them with a magical powder laced on the paper. Whoever sent it wanted them there. They snoop put the town and crash through the castle walls into the kings throne room where the same wizard  finally leads them to their original point of Dororboras the frail man in the middle of the road, he was the only person that is the same in both towns. They find Doroboras talking to himself in his house on how clever her is, After confronting him about the trap he clearly set he transforms into that very same raven from the letter and flutters away. Chulo uncovers a book that explains they must kill a guardian of the gods at their \"gate\" to release the god, touching the book makes that simple key burn intensely. But Fights distracts him by finding a trap door, Chulo jumps right in and the Deep orb is pulled from him by a strange force to the ground breaking and sliding to a gate releasing a beautiful demon standing powerfully Infront of them, they attempt to flirt with her and are easily shot down, so it's a fight it seems. Wrong they are bound by her whip, she mocks them as she spreads her wings and busts through the two layers off the house, and begins to fly possibly in the direction of the elven Capitol.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello again Gametales! I’m back for the next part of my party’s eternal screw-up. Last time a bard and a paladin failed some pretty crucial skill checks and ended themselves stranded in Carceri, the prison dimension where no one can leave. Read that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5xr2g8/how_my_party_was_almost_dissolved_in_a_single/) if you haven’t yet.\n\nThe plan was to have a one-shot adventure to resolve the issue but the one shot went a little long and became a two-shot! Tonight i’m going to be telling you all the things that happened during our session tonight and I should be back tomorrow with part 2, them hopefully getting out of Carceri unscathed. For now, let’s get into it.\n\nThe story:\n\nSo we start off with Amelia, our bard, and Grant, our paladin, where we left them last time, stranded in Carceri. Amelia jumps on her broom and flies up as high as she can to take a look around and breaks the gravity barrier, floating about in the ether between globes, tethered only by her broom. Looking around she notices a number of other globes extending out into space in either directions and heads back down letting Grant know what was up. They set off to try and find civilization.\n\nThe first group they came across was not as civilized as they had hoped. They came across a cult of satan worshippers with a bit of a strange twist. The cult felt it best to connect to their deity by consummating with a physical manifestation of their god. They tried to recruit our two adventurers to their ways but the party decided it would be best if they moved on. The duo asked if there was anywhere else they could go and they were directed to Bastion, the fortress headquarters of the Revolutionary League.\n\nThe two decided to try out the Bastion and arrived a day or two later, landing in front and walking up to the guards. A conversation ensued, involving the guards trying to extort the group for gold and the bard eventually convincing the guards to drink some very powerful alcohol that knocked them out immediately. They walked inside and found the leader of the bastion, a Githyanki named Silus, and through some careful negotiation and precise bribery, managed to find out just about nothing as to how to leave Carceri. They found out about a possible portal in the center of the plane but nothing more about where it was or how to access it or even what was guarding it. But they had a goal now.\n\nThey headed to the second ring of Carceri, Cathrus, after picking up some extra protection from the locals and another run in with the goat cult where they almost went through with initiation. Low on food at this point they decided “we have an alchemy jug, we can definitely survive off of beer and honey” and proceeded with their adventure. They found a tree village on an orb that was nothing but acidic mud and crimson trees. Full of slavers and slaves they found their way to the leader and after getting a minimal amount of information, about some key pieces and a person named Nerull who was guarding the portal, out of him were almost captured as slaves themselves. The paladin, a little fed up with everyone’s shit, set the building on fire. The duo flew away to a fabled poison shop by the name Apothecary of Sin.\n\nAt this point the duo had been surviving off beer and honey for a few days and had loosened up a bit. Walking in they found a surprisingly kind glabrezu by the name of Sinmaker who, with a little bit of business on the party’s part, managed to actually give them the location of the first key piece to Nerull’s fortress. They bought a few poisons from him and went on their way. \n\nFrom here i inserted the first of a few time jumps the group would experience. It had been about 3 months and the two had been working odd jobs, mostly mercenary work, for money and had come back to Bastion. They were on the verge of death from eating nothing but beer and honey, and figured with the extra cash they’d be able to get a little more information out of them. In fact they found out that Bastion had a series of magical food boxes that would just produce food for them. Sustenance problems solved, they went on their way to find the temple of Parrafaire, the location of the first key to Nerull’s temple. A 3 year time jump later and the group are stronger, richer, and maybe just a little bit more evil. They had finally found the temple of Parrafaire and were about to brave it’s depths for the key piece. We ended the session here and will  begin again tomorrow night in hopes of the two getting out of the hellhole they’ve found themselves in. Although they may not be the same as when they went in.",

        "text": "This story comes from the first campaign I ever played in.  It’s been a few years so I apologize if there is some gaps.  This one might be a bit long and I’m not that much of a writer so I apologize in advance. \n\nThe cast:  \n\nGreyson (My character):  A half-elf dragon sorcerer.  Forced to live as a hermit from an extremely early age due to a dark family prophecy.  He is naïve, inquisitive, and childlike.  Inspires to constantly do the “right thing”.  He may or may not also contain the soul of a terribly evil red dragon.  \n\nCutis:  Homebrewed half-drow Ranger Hunter.  Edgy McEdgy.  Raised by slavers.  Dark, silent, vindictive, and wears a creepy full faced mask (The nation which is made up of city-states hates and is constantly at war with the drow).  Cutis also hates Drow with a passion as they raped his mother which led to a life of slavery.  Loves to shoot things for as much damage as possible.  \n\nViola: Half-Orc Rogue Swashbuckler.  A former pirate who still has an all-encompassing love for loot.  Loves to drink.  Loves to steal.  Did I say, she loves loot and booze?\n\nThor:  Dwarf Valor Bard.  An alcoholic bard with a wicked sense of humor.  Will attempt to sleep with anyone and anything that resembles a female.  Kicked out of the religious city state to inappropriately using suggestion. (Use your mouth…wait, I mean mind).   Constantly forgets to inspire and use most of his spells but will mock you relentlessly out of combat.  \n\nNicholas: Half-elf Monk:  Loves to punch things.  Really loves to punch things.  Really really loves to punch things.  Known as Nicholas the Gryphon Slayer and has built up quite the following.  (Another story for another day).  \n\nVindictive Much?\n\nThis tale starts with the party in the underdark in search for magical McGuffin of an orb that none of us even bothered to research and find out what it truly was. All we knew was we were racing against our sexy evil red-headed elf nemesis who was a raging b*tch. (Who of course Cutis fell madly in love with.)  If you’re wondering she was based on Poison Ivy, and yes we also had to deal with versions of the Joker and Bane.  \n\nWe came across a temple populated with Scatchery (A homebrew race of rat people based on the Skaven from Warhammer Fantasy).  The temple is dedicated to the God of Disease and his many sick and quite frankly disgusting followers populate the temple.  They embrace their god and his many gifts he bestowed upon them with glee.  While our party is quite the unique site we are allowed to enter without hostilities.  We claimed to be followers of the God.  They were happy to see us.  Outsiders that could spread their Gods word in the world above.  By word I mean the black plague, small pox and many other wonderful itchy puss filled diseases they worship. \n\nGreyson had already been infected with a terrible plague, Rat Rot, in a battle with the rat king which led to the underdark.  To him he felt a fulfilling connection with this terribly diseased place.  The disease lowered your healing hit-point diced and reduced all healing effects in half.  The other party members wanted to get out, and get out fast.   \n\nWe eventually made our way out of the main temple into the back of the complex, where only its priests were allowed.  Our investigating led us to a central room that had six vats filled of different colored liquids of different viscosities.  Also sat a large tank filled with adorable moles.  The large vats opened into three different aqueducts inside the floor that led to three different paths into three different rooms.  Left, Center and Right.  \n\nWe quickly summarized that the liquids had to be different diseases that the priests had created.  The party looked at the moles and it clicked.  (Our DM is mean.)  \n\nGreyson who was a bit naïve was convinced the moles loved to these wonderfully colored fruity mixtures.  He chose the white syrupy liquid, I mean it did look like milk.  While milk is good for the bones, this was not.  The mole started to screech in horror as its bones erupted from its skin in spikes.  Greyson in panic and horror took the once adorable mole by the tail and repeatedly bashed it into the wall.  \n\nGreyson was in shock as one by one the other party members took the moles to the different vats for a large and varied sampling.   \n\nA red liquid turned the mole into a raging angry beast.  It snarled, baring its teeth in utter rage and hate.  \n\nThe blue liquid caused the mole to shiver uncontrollably.  Sniffles, sneezes and a cough followed.  It really looked like it needed a blanket. \n\nA dark thick muddy liquid caused the skin of a mole to harden immensely into a course bark like texture that made it extremely difficult to move.  \n\nThe dark green liquid was not a good one.  The poor mole developed large puss filled boils that exploded as it withered in its own waste.   \n\nLastly was a brown liquid that Greyson immediately felt connected to.  It was Rat Rot.  Vomit inducing Rat Rot.  \n\nAt this point Greyson could not take it anymore.  He tipped the tank of moles over to set them free.  Run Moles run!  He of course placed the littlest one in his backpack.  Mr. Moley became a fixture in the many adventures ahead.  \n\nClearly the aqueducts were meant to carry the diseases to the different rooms.  Now this is where things start to get a bit hazy unfortunately.  \nEach room was investigated before we decided to just let these diseases flow. \n\nThe center room was the most interesting.  In a cage that was placed in a large empty hole was a single male drow.  He was emaciated and looked utterly desperate.  When he realized we weren’t with the Scatchery he begged for us to free him.  Around the cage stood 5 summoning circles.  (Oh look at that, we have exactly 5 party members.) \n\nWe also see that it looks like the aqueduct from the center path led directly into this pool.  We also saw to ports that led from the left and right into the pool as well.  After some investigating and talking with the desperate drow we were able to put together how this device worked.  \n\nBehind the cage and drow stood a large magical door that would only open if we were to fill the pool with diseases, which happened to be holding the drow.  We could fill the hole with the liquids and the door would open.  In the process it would drown the drow.  However, what we also discovered was that if all of us were to contract a disease, through a ritual we would be able to open the cage and free the drow.  Now an intense argument broke out.\n\nCutis, our half-drow hating drow wanted this bastard to die.  He wanted him to suffer.  Viola our half-orc thought it would be pretty funny so she was in.  Greyson, being the altruistic person begged for the life of the drow.  After a long back and forth the drow agreed to give us a detailed map of the underdark if we were to set him free.  \n\nHowever, before we could set him free we needed to first deal with the other two rooms.  (I forgot the exact reasoning).  One contained a fight with some plague zombies and the other was a puzzle.  With our successes we now had the fun choice of picking our own diseases. \n\nFor Greyson it was an easy choice.  The Rat Rot.  He needed it.  He wanted it.  On drinking it he immediately vomited and loved it.  \n\nMany of the other party members drank the blue liquid.  A cold didn’t seem too bad.  The headache was intense but they were right.  It was one of the least dangerous.  They suffered an intelligence penalty from what I remember.\n\nHowever, Nicholas our monk being a bad ass, drank the bone spurring white syrupy liquid.  I mean what punch loving monk doesn’t want to be Wolverine?  He immediately took damage as his bones ripped from his skin but they provided him with extra damage.\n\nI have to give it to our DM, he did a fantastic job thinking up of all these diseases and the different effects they would have on us.  \n\nSo forth we went to set the Drow free.  With the ritual completed the cage was opened.  He began to sketch out the map as we picked the three diseases we drank from to fill the pool.  We watched as the cage where the drow once stood was submerged.  \n\nSetting the Drow free came with a cost however.  We all suffered from pretty major negative effects from the diseases.  As we were finishing up and planning to move in the next room the next set of events will forever be part of my gaming memory.\n\nCutis had grabbed Viola and began to talk with her.  How dare could we let this evil drow go free without any punishments.  We suffered terrible diseases to let him go.  Giving us the map was not enough.  It had to suffer the same as we had.\n\nAs the drow handed over the map, Cutis and Viola grabbed the weak man and dragged his face to the vat spitting out Rat Rot.  They held his face into the pouring liquid and screamed for him to drink.  The drow had no choice as he drank and coughed and sputtered in the plague filled brown liquid.  Vindictive would you say?     \n\nWhat happened next took all of us by surprise.  The Drow started to writhe and twist in screaming pain.  His skin started to rip off and he turned into a huge disease ridden monster.  He embodied the very nature of the disease he drank.  You see, the scatchery had been experimenting to turn him into a plague fueled super weapon.  The battle was brutal.  Already weakened by the plagues we barely survived the fight.  \n\nYou see, our DM thought A) We would weaken ourselves by taking on the diseases and setting the drow free B) We do not set the drow free and he is infected by all three liquids erupting into a huge plaque monster and a fight would ensue.  Either way we would use resources and be weakened moving forward.  What he did not expect was us to purposely contract the diseases to free the drow and then immediately turn the drow into a huge disease plague monster.  \n\nIt was a pretty epic and the moment our party realized that being vindictive only leads to amazing memories.  \n",

        "text": "The first part of this story is going to be a little vague, as both in and out of character I've only really understood the more broad strokes of what happened.\n\nTHREE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE EMPIRE... A motley crew of adventurers finds themselves embroiled in the war between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. Yinak, the crew's very scared of everything Bothan Pilot. IZ21 (Simply called Izzi by the group) the crew's droid mechanics expert. Kordath the crew's Gank Cybernetics expert/ interpersonal data extraction specialist, and I jedi who I have really only heard stuff about. (Man if you see this I am sorry I just suck with names.)\n\nThey get an assignment to eliminate a senator, and upon speaking with her get a better offer to keep her safe. It turns out, the group's contact was a member of the Sith Empire and does not take this lightly. Sith begin hunting the group down. The group attempts to turn this information to the galactic senate, and ends up inadvertently murdering several senators.\n\nThis, understandably, upsets the Galactic Republic. The party finds themselves on the run from just about everyone in the known galaxy. They dump the one senator they were supposed to kill but chose to save on a random space station, and try to outrun both the empire and the republic.\n\nIn a desperate gambit they try something unheard of... Hyperspace jumping through the galactic core. (The GM, not wanting to outright murder them, makes them roll a nearly impossible check, on which they get several triumphs.)\n\nAnd they find themselves seated squarely in front of a star destroyer. Assuming this is a new type of vessel hunting them, the crew takes off, jumping from system to system, finding remnants and relics of old space stations where their starmaps say ports should be. Finally, they jump into a system where their is life, and a space station. The group is hailed, and informed their credentials are corrupted and must land on the station to sort out the issue.\n\nNow, there was a young man on that space station. Those on Tattooine know him as a slave of a powerful Hutt, they also know him as the most dependable spice dealer you can find. So long as he hasn't smoked all of the product himself. Samatek, a human smuggler. (Myself) Sam was tasked by the hutt with ensuring a shipment of a new spice known as \"Slag\" arrived at its destination. Unfortunately the transport used had been flagged for investigation and was captured by the Imperial Outpost. The passengers aboard were believed to be blameless and were told to make arrangements to return to their homes. Sam had no intention of telling his Hutt master that the crates of Slag were in imperial hands, and simply loitered around the station, smoking what Slag he had managed to get off the ship \n\n(HomeBrew Pitstop! - Slag. Think a cigar, but made of metal. A three use ignition cap on the end breaks off to start the chemical reaction, and can be screwed back on to preserve a half smoked Slag stick. The smell is reminiscent of an electric fire in a barber shop. The drug itself is in high demand among bounty hunters as it sharpens your senses and improves your reflexes. Unfortunately, inhaling metal vapors leaves a lasting effect on the body. Consistent slag users lose the color in their eyes, instead becoming a gunmetal grey, skin loses its red, and hair begins to grow grey. Metallic skin tags appear on the face and eyelids, especially around the mouth.)  \n\nThe party, I am reliably informed, has never had a good interaction with authority, and when questioned by an imperial officer on the station (after having their ship tractor beamed in), pull their blasters. \n\nA giant mostly cybernetic Nexu bursts from their cargo hold as the shooting starts. (Think [this](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/5/55/Nexu2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120428155440) but with [this](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5c/Rex_cyberdog.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120928235020) level of cybernetics.) and proceeds to wreak havoc as the crew immediately returns to their ship and prepares for takeoff. Sam, being no stranger to the Empire's wrath, decides to take his chances and slips into the landing strut as it retracts into the ship.\n\nSadly, our tech troubles at work that gave me a window to write this have been resolved. Keep your eyes peeled for part 2, where I recount sessions I was present for!",

        "text": "I'm a long-ish time lurker, and first time poster on this sub-reddit (save for a few comments), but I felt like our last D&amp;D session was too weird not to share a few.\n\nOur party is going through a campaign that the DM has spruced up a bit from the one he got in a box to make it more interesting (I can’t remember the campaign title), and although we have lots of fun together, none of our party members are too out of the box.\n\nBut then there’s Taenaran Weabow. Based on his initial character concept, he’s as cookie cutter as it gets-an elf ranger who grew up in the forests, thinks he’s the best archer, and wears nothing but browns and greens. However, the player has made this guy absolutely ridiculous. A few sessions ago he fell in love with an NPC who was a female elven ranger. Despite constant rebuffs he wouldn’t give up, and still attempted to influence her after it turned out she was one of the villains. Later on, we met a knight kept alive via a curse, and he attempted to intimidate this knight with an impressive backflip. Sure, the backflip was impressive, but the knight certainly wasn’t intimidated.\n\nFast forward to last session, and the female elven ranger comes back, apparently let out of jail by the lord of the city we’re staying at. After explaining that she had had a change of heart and was allowed to come if she stayed right by Taenaran’s side, he started to go into a dialogue about how much he cared for her and all that. However, during that conversation the DM quickly revealed that it was actually my character in disguise, showing up after being gone from last session. Most of us laughed at that for a few minutes, but Taenaran (and the player) was devastated. …and just to be clear, no the game wasn’t ruined, he got over it quite quickly.\n\nFast forward even more, we’re getting to the final parts of a long fight. After hiding in the sheets of the bed in the room we were holed up in, Taenaran came out of the room wearing the sheet like a ghost, making cheesy ghost noises, and rolling acrobatics to run along the wall and look like he was floating. Combat stopped for a split second as the remaining enemies just stared dumbfounded at this loon interrupting the combat. Then they started chuckling a bit, while Taenaran got out his bow to attack.\n\nI don’t think anyone was expecting much from him, but then he rolled a critical on his double attack daily power, splitting open the skull of one and nearly killing another. The hobgoblins stopped laughing at him at that point.\n",

        "text": "I’ve been lucky to find a great group of guys to game with for the last year or so on a weekly basis.  We have had some amazing stories over the time.  Mostly we have played WOD Vampires but recently have started a new d&amp;d game.  \n\nThe story involves one of our PC’s we love dearly; we shall call him Zoe.  Devious.  Secretive.  Occasionally double crossing.  His Vampire arc is legendary and let us say he made the most of using illusions for his own grand plans.  \n\nHowever, this story is not about Vampires it is about our new D&amp;D game.  Set in a dark, cold, and unforgiving land.  A mix of dark souls and castlevania inspired darkness that has evil consuming the land itself.   \n\nZoe’s first D&amp;D character was exactly what we thought it would be.  A rogue-halfing who attempted to steal or deal for anything he thought was of value.  Hijinks followed but he remained a devious thieving bastard nonetheless.  He at one point had stolen a priceless heirloom of our quest giver, the ring of his deceased wife.  This old man cried to us, as it was his last possession with any connection to his recently dead loving wife.  Zoe drank the man’s pour wine while he consoled him.   \n\nDuring an epic battle with a great evil Hag and her ogre and gnoll followers, our rogue took a critical blow knocking him unconscious.  The hag shoved him in a bag, which was somewhat ironic, and vanished into the darkness.\t\n\nSad at the loss of our party member, regardless if he caused us some headaches, we carried forward.  Zo told us his next character was going to be different.  He was going to be a stand up hero.  We were looking forward to the change and new dynamic.  Our party is dysfunctional enough; a true hero might turn this rag tag bunch around and bring us together.  \n\nFast forward to our next game.  We find Zoe’s new character and a large magical snail being attacked by a large group of bloodthirsty goblins.  We knew the shell of the snail contained powerful anti-magic properties that could be used to help turn the battle against the three evil Hags that plague the land and our party.  The battle is hard, bloody, and intense.  In the end, the goblins fall one by one, growing weaker with each one that falls.  \n\nAt last, we stand alone with this human magic user and the great snail.  We greet him, happy that we could help save him from the goblins.  The human wizard with a black-eye looks back at us, and yells back “Who said I needed your help!”.  We tell him that the snail is our prize, that we need it to rid the world of these terrible hags but he can join us and share the prize.  He nods, “Fuck you, it’s mine!”  He immediately casts Darkness and attempts to escape with the snail.  We end up knocking him unconscious and see that his once human form turns into a pale nose-less monster.  A changeling.  \n\nSome RP tendencies die hard.   \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n",

        "text": "[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5whkvh/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)\n\nExcerpt From the Journal of Willow Berrypipe:&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce, many years ago, Varisia was home to a sixth band of Goblins – The Bonegrinder Tribe. They resided in and around Shank’s Wood, until one fearless man ground the Bonegrinders right out of existence.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday Daviren Hosk spends his time working at his stables, where he tends to the horses of Sandpoint and polishes his rather unique collection of goblin remains. Visitors to the stables first come across dozens of tiny goblin ears strung across the room, each with a name seared into the flesh.\n“Goblins hate words. They think words steal their souls, or some such.” Hosk explains. “I cuts off their ears and makes ‘em watch when I write in the name. Ahh, the screaming is really somethin’ to hear.”&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGrizzly as this sounds, it’s not the most disturbing part of his collection. That title belongs to the pickled remains of the Bonegrinder leader, Chief Whartus. Surprisingly well preserved in a jar of brine, visitors to the stable can easily see where Hosk’s hatchet cleaved through the head of the erstwhile chief. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe vendetta started many years ago, when Hosk was a young man of four and twenty, although very few people know the details. The Bonegrinder tribe were a particularly malicious group and plagued the residents of Sandpoint for many years, killing livestock and dogs, burning buildings, stealing babies from their cribs. For Daviren Hosk, the last straw was the murder of his much beloved family dog. Daviren found the corpse in his front yard one morning, drained almost entirely of blood and horribly mutilated. The seal of the Bonegrinder tribe has been burned repeatedly into the flesh, dozens of marks from snout to tail. To this day, Hosk pales at the sight of that talisman.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHosk spent the next decade hunting the Bonegrinder tribe. Skilled in hand-to-hand combat and equally talented with a bow, Hosk proved a fierce warrior in countless battles. With the help of a few loyal friends, he led more than a dozen raids on the tribes main camps, killing goblins by the hundreds. His collection of ears grew quickly, and villagers could sometimes hear the goblins screaming, if the wind shifted just right during one of Hosk’s almost nightly raids.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith their numbers dwindling, the Bonegrinders lost all semblance of organization – their once bustling camps disappeared, replaced with ragged bands of goblins that haunted Shank’s Woods and the surrounding area. Less dangerous in small numbers, they still proved a menacing presence to farmers and villagers.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHosk would spend several years scouring the area for signs, tracking and hunting, killing every member he could find. Even today, travelers may stumble across one of his flyers, offering payment for tips on the location of surviving Bonegrinders . Finally, after nearly 15 years of devoted hunting – after two broken marriages and the loss of three children and near financial ruin – Hosk stumbled upon the last encampment and found himself face to face with the elusive Chief Whartus.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTall for a goblin, with a ropy, muscular frame and blood-red eyes, Chief Wharton was a sight to behold that night. Firelight danced across his face, badly scarred from years of battles and raids. Tufts of mangy grey hair sprouted from his prominent ears, and his smile revealed a mouth full of rotting, yellowed fangs. Clutching a spiked club, never breaking his gaze with Hosk, Wharton banged his chest, bellowed the Bonegrinder battle cry, and charged. Two dozen goblins rushed forth with crude knives and torches waving.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHosk, surrounded and alone, felt a tremor of fear course through is veins. Thinking himself finally beaten but planning to take as many goblins with him as possible, Davirn gripped the handle of his trusty hatchet and entered the fray with a blood curdling scream.\n“I don’t know how long it lasted – seemed like hours,” Hosk says now. “I lost track of everything, except the screaming – god, how they shrieked.”&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHis hatchet served him well that night. At the end of the battle, twenty five goblin corpses littered the ground, including the body of Chief Wharton. Hosk, blood-soaked and badly wounded, laid himself down on the ground among the dead, and slept. It was here, in the middle of a bloody pool, that a farmer found Davirn the next day. Helped by the terrified farmer, Hosk dragged Wharton’s body home.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile he is undeniably a brave and heroic gentleman, and while he’s always happy to show visitors the body of Chief Whartus and talk about his deep hatred of goblins, Davirn Hosk does not often speak of the battle of Shank’s Woods. To this day, I don’t believe any living soul knows the true details of what happened in those woods, or how Davirn managed to escape death that night; Mr. Hosk is the only person left alive who could give a full accounting and, in his own words “The nitty gritty of that night ain’t somethin’ you want to be hearing.” &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5z5fwi/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "text": "Edit: This is D&amp;D 5th Edition. Sorry for forgetting it in the title!\n\nHello gametales! This is my first time posting, because this is the first story i’ve had that I thought was really worthy of a gametales post. I hope you all enjoy it!\n\nThe setup:\n\nWe’re a fairly new group. I, as the DM, have been playing for about 3 years now. My players are mostly new as of the summer last year. So we’re all kind of feeling our way into this D&amp;D thing. The players are as follows:\n\nAmelia, an Aasimar Bard.\n\nGrant, an Earth Genasi Paladin.\n\nEnstina, a Warforged Monk.\n\nCelexa, an Elf Wizard.\n\nNow we’ve been playing this campaign for a few months and the group’s just a few xp away from level 6 at this point. In the campaign I’m writing, Tiamat is rising up against Bahamut to be ruler of all dragons. The part has been sent on a number trials by Mechanus to prove their worth to be the champions that push back Tiamat. They’re currently on their second real trial and this trial is based around a lethargic town and a possibly corrupt military/aristocracy(Trying to be vague as some of my players will be reading this). The party has just gotten to the wall surrounding the main castle and are planning on how to reach the castle without being spotted. This is where our story begins.\n\nOne more note before I continue, I have a fairly high magic campaign so each of my players has a number of magic items that they probably shouldn’t have at their level. So if some of the items don’t seem right for 6th level characters that’s why.\n\nThe story:\n\nSo as I said the group is sitting outside the gate, trying to decide how to get in. They’re arguing for a bit about plans and eventually the guards at the gate notice them and all of their plans begin to just happen at once. The bard’s pixie familiar polymorphs the paladin into a butterfly, the monk and the bard get on a broom and go invisible, attempting to fly in, and then the wizard tries using her helm of minor teleportation to teleport into the castle. The wizard immediately fails and is teleported outside the town. The two on the broom are invisible but the broom itself is not, and a group of guards charge out and start firing crossbows at them, one of them scoring a natural 20. The two barely hang on and decide to hightail it back to the slums. The paladin, still as a butterfly and accompanied by an invisible pixie, decides to head to the castle anyway, see what he can find out. After some scouting he finds that the lord of the town has a son.\n\nTime passes, the party regroups and they start formulating new plans. Now our paladin recently picked up an Amulet of the Planes as a boon from Mechanus and decides to try and do some plane-shifting to get into the castle. The bard decides that sounds like a splendid idea so she goes along with his plan. The group has had some not so great experiences with the amulet in the past, so the wizard and the monk want to try to get in on their own terms. \n\nFrom here things get a little hairy. In chronological order here’s what happens: The wizard teleports up to the castle grounds and casts disguise self. After some failed diplomacy she decides to just teleport up to an open window and latches on. She jumps up into a servants quarter and waits it out, invisible, until the room clears out. She then traipses into the hall, masquerading as one of the young lord’s tutors. All seems to be going well so far yes? Next up is the warforged. He sneaks up to the inner wall, also invisible thanks to the pixie from before. A little ninja wall jumping and a lack of extra invisibility spells leads our friend to flight and he just goes for it. Flies right over the innermost walls and directly over a group of wizards who start shooting fireballs at him. One gets a direct hit, dealing 50 damage and knocking the monk unconscious and plummeting quite a distance. On impact he takes another 62 damage, killing him instantly. As these are new players i will admit I had a cleric from the town revivify him as I didn’t want to kill his character off quite yet. \n\nBut then there’s Amelia and Grant. The two who decided to go plane hopping. Through some wizardry and house-ruling I allowed the paladin to change the attribute to use the amulet so it fit more with his better attributes, but even then this little trip did not go so well. It started alright. He teleported to Ysgard, a plane they’ve been to before, and then on the return trip to the material plane had a bit of a mis-teleport and ended up on a desert island in the middle of an ocean. Trying again to teleport out of the prime material the paladin rolled low. And then on the percentage die he rolled poorly as well, meaning he would be teleporting to a random plane of existence, how wonderful! I roll on my random planes table and roll an 18, which corresponds to Carceri. \n\nNow I enjoy alternate planes but I’m no authority on the outer planes and I had forgotten what Carceri was. Looking through the description it didn’t seem that bad; you know general evil prison plane, some gross landscapes, doesn’t sound too bad. O what’s this extra rule here? No teleporting out of the plane except by a wish spell? Now this will be interesting.\n\nThey port in and the amulet changes color as it does for all planes. I’ve decided carceri is colored black with vertical gray bars, similar to a jail cell. They pop up in a gross mucky bog area and decide they don’t like it much so they’ll port out. The paladin concentrates and… nothing. He tries again, rolling even better and still… nothing. It’s at this point they call on a divine servant of mechanus they’ve been talking to as a guide of sorts on their mission and he shows up and regretfully informs them that they are trapped here unless they can find one of the rumored secret exits from Carceri.\n\nAnd that was how we ended the session. Two players trapped in a demonic prison plane, one dying, and one just having a lovely time as a tutor. We’ll be having a one-shot for the players on Carceri on Wednesday, and I’m very excited to see how this affects their characters. Anyway, thank you all for reading, hope this was enjoyable!",

This is a direct continuation to 'This is Who We Are: Part 3', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5osoam/shadowrun_4th_edition_this_is_who_we_are_part_3/. Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment or send me a private message. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThe following tale has no grounding in real life. Any resemblance to people real or fictional is entirely coincidental and hilarious. Please, ABSOLUTELY try running Shadowrun at home.\n\nThe world was ending: A rag-tag alliance of meta-humans were making a desperate last stand against the invaders from another planet, armed with nothing more than swords and spears. The aliens incinerated the defenders by the hundreds even as arcane energy burned across their hulls and the pilots \nsuffered a magical assault. Kahu watched it all from a comfortable chair and a fluted wine glass held lightly in one hand, a look of mild interest on her face. \n\n\"Weirdest job ever.\" It had started a week ago, as the team sat arrayed around a hand-carved table. The restaurant was an exercise in extravagance, with tastefully gilded chandeliers suspended from the roof and smartly dressed wait-staff shuffled throughout the property. Jana was the only one who seemed to fit in, sitting confidently in a cocktail dress that cost more than the weapons she was carrying. Her team-mates were uncomfortable in both their matching suits and this place, though they each hide it with varying degrees of success. Kahu covered her anxiety with a trade-mark scowl while Burnie maintained a blank visage, though they both had minor tells regarding the situation. \n\n\"Hit me up with another beer, love.\" Patu bellowed out across the floor, tapping his now empty polished glass mug. One of the diligent workers appeared off of his elbow and refilled the mug with a pleasant smile. \"Thanks babe.\" Patu grinned up at her without a care in the world, leaning back in his chair. \"This place is bloody awesome, guys. Why don't we come here more often?\" He questioned the group. \n\n\"Patu.\" Kahu snapped at him. The mystic adept shot her a questioning glance and she gestured to the other member of their group: Their client, a heavy-set troll woman garbed in immaculate attire. The Johnson watched them with an arched eyebrow, disdain evident on her face. Patu coughed once and sat up a little straighter. Jana smiled at their potential employer without any trace of irritation or annoyance. \"Please continue, Miss Johnson.\" She bade, her tone professional. The team sat forward as she began to speak. \n\n\"Now that you're paying attention: I require the services of a team that is able to provide protection for my employer in a number of venues, ranging from populated to private. You will be working alongside another team who will operate as personal surveillance and protection but you will have little interaction with them. You are to neutralise threats to the target without disturbing his time in Auckland. No interruptions, no disruptions and no distractions. Failure to do so will result in docked payment.\" The elvish woman spoke curtly, her tone raising Patu's hackles. Before he could speak, Kahu latched onto his arm with a vice-grip. She said nothing but the look on her face was enough to make him back down.\n\n\"Are there any other requests?\" Jana questioned, eyes locked with the Johnson. It was startling how much could be implied in a single, short statement. Their intermediary finally hesitated, a glint of something undefinable in her eyes.\n\n\"If at all possible, you are to accompany him to a public event in one week's time. It will be incredibly difficult to acquire access for this event but that will be up to you. If anyone will attempt to move against Mister Sali-bull, it will be there.\" She gestured and a data packet was forwarded to each of them. She continued speaking as they reviewed the documents. \"You will be paid four hundred nuyen an hour, each, for your services.\" Patu whistled loudly, clearly impressed by the amount. The Johnson ignored him entirely. \"Mister Sali-bull will be within Auckland for seven days and will require you to be available at all hours.\" She smoothed down her suit and offered Jana a hand. \"Have we come to an arrangement?\" \n\n\"Not quite. We will require a ten thousand nuyen spending account up front and the fee will be an extra fifty nuyen an hour.\" Jana smiled coldly at the troll. \"If we're needed at all hours then we can't take any other work. We are professionals, after all, and we need to be treated as such.\" The Johnson maintained her composure admirably but Jana still saw the imperceptible wince. Her team-mates could not help but liken it to a shark pursuing wounded prey, the scent of blood thick in the water. \"If you find that unacceptable, please feel free to find another team of suitable agents on short notice. They'll demand significantly more but I don't need to tell you that.\" Jana leaned back in satisfaction. \"Do I?\" \n\n\"No. No, you do not.\" The Johnson growled through gritted teeth. \"Do you have any other requests?\" She asked stiffly. Patu perked up immediately but Burnie passed him another beer to shut him up.\n\n\"I think that we have a deal. Thank you for your time, Miss Johnson. We'll accept the contract gladly and look forward to receiving the relevant information.\" With that, Jana rose from her seat with a casual grace. The Johnson responded in kind and edged out of the booth. The runners watched her sizeable form stomp past raucous customers before vanishing outside. Only once she was gone did Jana drop the polite facade and collapse back into her chair, hyperventilating. To say her colleagues were surprised would be a mild understatement.\n\n\"What the fucking fuck?\" Patu questioned loudly, staring at his wheezing friend. \"What is wrong with you, you bloody tit?\" Jana weakly flipped him the bird. Kahu smacked Patu over the head before settling down next to the panicking explosives enthusiast.\n\n\"Jana, what's wrong?\" There was an uncharacteristic gentleness in the sniper's voice. \"You need to calm down and explain it to us.\" Kahu instructed firmly. Jana nodded sipped from a glass of water that Burnie slid towards her, nodding her thanks to the driver.\n\n\"Our client is Fa'afi Sali-bull.\" Blank stares answered her. \"Chief Executive Officer of the Neo-Samoan Pharmaceutical Company?\" She growled, her anxiety giving way to exasperation. Still nothing. \"He's the most powerful crime-lord in the Polynesian Alliance.\" Jana snapped at her friends. She derived a certain vindictive pleasure from the sudden realisation on their faces, from the way they all sat straighter in fear. \"Yeah, that's what's wrong with me. Assholes.\" Jana muttered darkly. \n\nThe runners sat in silence for a time. The only noise was Patu gulping down his beer, small rivulets of liquid running down his chin. When he was finished, he seized Burnie's untouched drink and guzzled that as well. It was only after he had consumed Jana's fruity cocktail shortly after that he spoke.\n\n\"Right then. So, how do we want to do this?\" A week later, Burnie was waiting patiently by at a private air strip. He sat comfortably in an armoured limousine that the team had acquired for this particular mission, occasionally performing cursory scans of the airport. The driver was less than concerned about any kind of attempt on their client's life given his back-up. To be perfectly honest, he was more worried about the back-up.\n\n\"Are you sure that's him?\" Jana asked across the channel. \"It's been more than a year and you took a few blows to the head. Maybe you're just confused.\" She remarked from her position of relative safety. She and Patu sat several blocks away in his truck, performing sweeps of the perimeter at random intervals. She had been their first port of contact with the other team; they were led by a mage called B and were already waiting for the client inside Auckland Airport. It was a small entourage of vehicles, not unlike our team's own, but most surprising was the man inside their jeep: A heavily augmented ork named Tank. His presence was a surprising and entirely unwelcome reminder of the past.\n\n\"The man shot me with a dart that injected bleeding edge nano-machines into my body.\" Burnie stated blandly. \"It's the kind of thing you tend to remember.\" Even if he hadn't, Kahu certainly had. The last time she had seen him was through a rifle scope, watching as he plummeted over the edge of a yawning chasm. \n\n\"Burnie's right. It's him.\" The hacker confirmed. \"Best I can tell, they're sticking to their comms. I'll keep on watch for now.\" Kahu was perched on a motorcycle just outside the terminal gate. The team had to pay a pretty penny to airport security for that but it was worth it. \"Jana, you talk to them much?\" \n\n\"A little. Went through the usual pleasantries. Tank's in the mini-moke over there along with the hacker. Name's Hamish. Ork girl on the bike's called Spyder and B should be driving that armoured limo.\" Jana highlighted each of them over the Image Link, silently thanking technology for making her job easier. \"Is anyone else worried that the same guy we were paid to kill just happens to be working the same job?\" Patu scoffed beside her, arms crossed in a huff.\n\n\"Not really. There's only so many runners in Auckland. Makes sense we'd run into him again.\" Kahu answered. \"Besides, I'd rather have him with us than against us.\"\n\n\"Why did we go through all the trouble of getting a fucking armoured limo if they've already got one?\" It was a valid question and one that irked Jana as well, though she would never admit as much. \n\n\"Might be playing the shell game. If two identical vehicles leave the airport then that's two targets someone would have to track.\" Burnie piped up. It was answer enough for the grumbling mystic adept. \"Besides, we have an armoured limousine. How cool is that?\" Even Patu had to grudgingly admit, it was kind of neat. Burnie narrowed his eyes and sat up a little straighter. \"Heads up. B's team is moving.\" The small convoy shifted positions, with Spyder driving to the front while Tank's light buggy pulled up just short of B's bumper.\n\n\"Getting a request to meet up.\" Kahu relayed, muting the conversation between she and Hamish. \"Burnie, pull up next to B.\" She ordered and the driver obeyed. Two identical limousines sat side-by-side, engines idling. \"Hamish just pinged me Sali-bull's flight plan. ETA is thirteen minutes.\" She snapped, riding up next Spyder. They exchanged curt nods before ignoring each other entirely. \n\n\"Your team's not a talkative bunch then?\" B joked, his rich voice transmitted directly to Jana. It was accompanied by real-time visual of a well-dressed man with an easy smile. She laughed back, the sound almost lyrical in nature.\n\n\"Not terribly so, I'm afraid. Everyone is pretty focused on this job but I'm always happy to have a chat.\" She flashed him a casual grin. \n\n\"Glad to hear it. Tank's the only one willing to have a natter on mission and it gets a little dull hearing him recite cyberware statistics.\" B jested lightly. While the two of them were talking, Kahu was tracking a private jet heading towards the airstrip. It matched the registration given to them by Miss Johnson and would arrive at the given time, factoring in velocity and a hundred other variables. Kahu was so busy doing the math that she almost missed the blinking message indicator. After the appropriate level of paranoid analysis, it revealed a text from Hamish: Target approaching, activate outriders.\n\n\"Who the fuck talks like that.\" She roused, sending a message to Patu and Jana. \"He's here, get moving.\" They pinged her an affirmative and arrived at roughly the same time that a small jet touched down before them. There was none of the typical bureaucracy involved with a new arrival; the airstair deployed and from it stepped the largest human any of them had ever seen. It suddenly made sense why they had to use a limousine built for trolls. Wrapped in a loosely fitting shirt and wearing khaki shorts, Sali-bull looked like just another tourist. The tribal tattoos covering his body would not have been out of place on any of the locals. He was, apart from his size, fairly innocuous. \n\n\"Jesus, he's a fat fuck.\" Patu quipped to Jana, the two of them sharing a chuckle. The Samoan crime lord stomped down the stairs and entered his limousine without a word. The team assumed a similar formation to their colleagues and began to drive alongside them.\n\n\"We're following them around for about half an hour and then we split up. We'll drive around for five hours, for sight-seeing purposes, then swing finish up for the day.\" Kahu instructed, keeping her eyes on the road while her digital agents patrolled cyberspace. The team followed behind, keeping chatter to a minimum and duplicating the exact movements of Sali-bull's escort. \n\nIt was a single turn before they were meant to split up that something went ding on Kahu's HUD. \"Contact, twelve o'clock, third floor.\" She snarled, highlighting the enemy with a thought in their shared display. An idle gesture connected them to the other runners. \n\n\"Folks, anyone else seeing that? Bastard has an RPG.\" Tank spat incredulously. There was a chorus of groaning across the channel; who brought high explosives to an urban area? \"Someone want to handle that? Now-ish?\" Tank implored nervously. It would have been amusing if there wasn't a rocket launcher pointed at them. \n\n\"I got them.\" Kahu brought her bike screeching to a stop and pulled the rifle from her back. She lined up her shot in half a second and squeezed the trigger. There were three short cracks and three bodies fell out of the window, hitting the ground with a dull thud. \"Done. Catching up.\" The others had since moved on. Kahu slung the rifle back over her shoulder and roared off after them. \n\nThe teams split up after that and things became incredibly easy. Jana and Patu bantered back and forth with Burnie chiming in occasionally. It was, to put it kindly, the easiest nuyen any of them had ever earned. This made all of them wary but none more than the paranoid Jana. \n\n\"This was way too easy.\" She complained after a sip of mojito. The four of them found themselves gathered around a bar table once again for a well-earned drink. \"There's no way that those three stooges are the only ones gunning for Mister Big.\" She waved her glass around wildly, ignoring the exasperated looks from her team. \"Seriously! We're being lulled into a false sense of security before the real attack comes. Mark my words!\" Jana intoned ominously. The effect was slightly ruined by the belch Patu let out after.\n\n\"Give it a rest, J. We did a day's work and we earned a day's pay.\" Patu laughed and raised his flagon in toast, clinking it with Burnie's mug in celebration. \"We've got a bunch of easy pay-days coming up. Let's enjoy that, yeah?\" The Maori mystic implored his high-strung friend. He banged his empty mug on the table and stood up unsteadily. \"Now if you lovely ladies, and Burnie, will excuse me...\" He trailed off and wandered towards the rest room. The trio watched him go in amusement before Kahu shook her head.\n\n\"He's gonna be trashed tomorrow. Jana, you're driving.\" The demolitions expert snorted in exasperation but nodded. Kahu downed her drink and placed the empty glass next to Patu's. \"I'm done for the night. Bright and early tomorrow. Make sure Sparky doesn't blow a fuse.\" She paid for her tab with a thought and waved goodbye over her shoulder. Burnie and Jana watched her go before settling in. They looked at each other in fierce contemplation before nodding. Battle lines were drawn as the two shadow operatives raised a hand.\n\n\"Rock, paper, scissors.\" Jana crowed in victory and downed the last of her drink. Burnie sighed good-naturedly as the former event planner blew him a kiss over her shoulder.\n\n\"Have fun getting him home.\" She sing-songed at him teasingly, strutting out behind Kahu. Burnie watched her go with small smile. It vanished when Patu staggered out of the rest room with a deafening crash, shaking the wall as he slammed into it. For the briefest of moments, Burnie really considered replacing the synth-juice in his cup with something stronger. It was going to be a long night.\n\nAs it turned out, it was a long week. The group managed to foil another pair of assassination attempts on Sali-bull with minimal effort. Even Patu would admit that Jana's theory was making a lot more sense now. So it was that the final day of Fa'afi Sali-bull's trip to Auckland came to pass and B contacted the team with some peculiar news.\n\n\"Sali-bull wants you guys to take primary escort duty.\" B said, his voice robbed of emotion. Jana managed to keep her face straight but there was a sinking feeling in her stomach. \n\n\"I thought you guys were handling that.\" She probed innocuously. \"The Johnson was pretty clear on that one.\" There was no change on her counterpart's face. \n\n\"Sali-bull changed his mind. Says we're too high profile for what comes next, so your crew gets to handle it.\" A data file appeared in Jana's mail, which Kahu began to scan immediately. \"Sali-bull says you have tickets. You're his escort, keep him alive, don't fuck it up.\" The transmission cut out suddenly enough to shock Jana's team into momentary silence. Patu glanced at his colleagues in bewilderment, gesturing wordlessly. \n\n\"I guess Jana was right.\" Kahu finally spoke, ignoring the Maori mime. \"The easy pay day was to good to be true.\" She mused. Spite and shock vied for control in Jana's mind; did she crow about her obviously superior intelligence or shudder at the possibilities for their task? \n\n\"Of course I was. Now we just need to find out what's going to happen.\" Both, as it turned out. The explosives expert leaned forward, finger steepled together. \"Here's a list of what we need. A lay-out of the venue, specifics about the event, a clientele list of everyone who will be attending and the contact information of a good tailor.\" The last addition made them all blink, even as she smiled and withdrew an actual laminate business card. \"Thankfully, I have the last part covered. I'll arrange for a session while you gather the rest.\" With a smirk that was almost impossibly smug, Jana slid out of the booth and swaggered away.\n\n\"She's fucking insufferable sometimes.\" Patu sighed. Kahu chuckled and Burnie patted his shoulder in commiseration. \"Actually, I might know someone who can help.\" The Maori perked up. He started flicking through his contact list, eyes glancing down the augmented reality display. Patu stopped on one particular name with a chuckle. \"Jade, that's the one. One of those Earth First fellas from a while back.\" \n\n\"You mean the guys who framed us for terrorism?\" There was a hint of incredulity in Kahu's voice but Patu brushed it off easily. \n\n\"Yeah but they're not all bad. Besides, I doubt they were the ones who framed us. Not really their style.\" No further questions arose of it but Kahu's glare had sharpened to the point that it could probably slice through ferrocrete. \"Anyway, Jade's kinda like my Mister Miyagi and Earth First have their fingers in a lot of pies. They might be able to help us out here.\" He made to call his contact but paused. \"What's the name of this place?\" Kahu had to count to ten before speaking, lest she do something she might sort of regret later.\n\n\"The Dwarven Fortress.\" The name might have held racist under-tones but it certainly reflected the location: A sprawling entertainment theatre and restaurant that had been carved into a mountainside. Staffed by metahumans from all walks of life, the Dwarven Fortress had been lauded as an innovative step forward in the performing arts. It combined advanced holographic software with traditional performance and heaped a gratuitous serving of drone control on top. The venue had only opened a month ago and there were already six month waiting periods to purchase a ticket. There was a certain elegance to such an event. That would be why Burnie, Patu and Kahu stood out like nails that needed hammering.\n\n\"Holy shit, guys. Are we seriously being paid for this?\" Patu whispered in awe, spinning on his heel to look around at the colossal amphitheatre. \"Best. Job. Ever.\" He idly accepted a fluted glass of champagne from one of the many service staff. \"Can we just stick with Fatty Bull for life?\" Patu asked over the channel. \n\n\"First, it's Sali-bull. At least get the client's name right.\" Kahu growled from seat, gripping her arm-rests tightly. She disliked people at the best of times and being stuck adrift in a sea of them made her...antsy. \"Second, shut up and do your job.\" She tried to say it nonchalantly, to avoid drawing attention, but she needn't have bothered; the room was practically trembling from excitement and no-one cared for anything other than the show. She sat in the alcove across from Sali-bull, watching the crime-lord with a wary gaze. \"Jana, why are we wearing these monkey suits?\" There was almost a pleading edge to the question. Next to Sali-bull, Jana smiled. \n\n\"Because we have to make a good impression. Chin up, dear. You look fantastic.\" The most suited to such gatherings, Jana felt right at home. She waved down a passing waiter and whispered a request in his ear. Less than sixty seconds later, Sali-bull was leaning back in his chair and enjoying a flagon of ale. \n\n\"B was right. You are good at what you do.\" Sali-bull's accent was strong but there was a presence to his words. Jana smiled demurely and inclined her head graciously. \"I can respect professionalism. You just keep things running smoothly and I might even throw in a bonus.\" The Samoan giant said with the barest hint of a grin before turning to face the stage. \"Now, don't bother me unless it's important.\" Jana hid her displeasure at being dismissed behind her courteous facade.\n\n\"He's a charmer.\" Burnie observed from the ground floor, sitting beside one of the Dwarven Fortress's many exits. \"Who eats a bucket of friend chicken at the theatre?\" He groused quietly, leaning back in his chair.\n\n\"Get the stick out of your arse, Fat Man. You're just here for a show, right?\" Patu coached in his own way, polishing off another mug of beer. He had clearly calmed down after realising there was an endless stream of alcohol, though inside he squealed with juvenile glee. Burnie sent him a variety of images that Google 3.0's profanity filter automatically shielded. The Maori laughed in response. \"Atta boy. Now, eyes on. Show's about to start.\" Patu wormed deeper into his chair, content with his lot in life.\n\nTrue to his word, the theatre lights began to dim until only flickering drones gleamed in the darkness. What happened next was one of the most impressive, bewildering things that the professional mercenaries had or would ever see: A procession of feral metahumans waging war upon each other in the thousands, Orks tearing Humans apart while Elves quarrelled with Dwarves and the Trolls killed whoever they could. Holograms, indistinguishable from reality even to the trained observer, allowed the battlefields to span over thousands of bodies while the physical actors took the key positions. Each of the chairs vibrated and roared as in-built speakers thrummed with the sounds of battle; scent markers brought the scent of war and desperation to those watching. It was enough to make the uninitiated gag and not a single person remained unshaken at the stench of death.\n\nAt the height of the war, strange forms descended from the heavens. Spheres the colour of obsidian rained death from above as lances of thermal energy burned Metahumanity apart. Those who fought died and those who fled found themselves struggling alongside old enemies. It was clear that life on Earth would be extinguished if an alliance could not be formed and so, with the plucky protagonist leading the charge from an ancient fortress, a new age dawned. \n\nIt was roughly halfway through the third act that Kahu spotted the assassin. She was a very plain looking human woman, brown hair and brown eyes, but she moved with the grace of a true predator. More importantly, she was the only member of the audience not paying attention to the show. This included Kahu's own team. \n\n\"Time to work for a living.\" The sniper hissed into their closed channel. Her vexation was enough to snap them all back to reality and they focused on the target painted in their shared image-link. \"She's heading for the alcove entrance. Patu, Burnie, see if you can close with her and get her somewhere private.\" Kahu ordered, already searching for the next threat. The duo pinged an affirmative and started moving, shuffling past an enthralled audience even as the tide turned in Metahumanity's favour. Their target slipped into the stairwell with Patu hot on her heels. Kahu had infiltrated the Dwarven Fortress' Network with little difficulty an hour ago; her hacking expertise enough to bypass their admittedly admirable defences. With her spoofed access credentials, it was a trivial matter to edit the alcove stairwell cameras. The rest was up to her team.\n\nIt wasn't going well, Patu thought as he took another fist to the face. She was a crafty little minx and good with her hands it seemed. If they weren't on opposite sides of the same run, he might have considered asking her out. To be perfectly honest, he still might as long as he survived. With magical security operating in the venue, Patu couldn't afford popping off a spell to gain the advantage and the woman was side-stepping every swing of Mjolnir. It was getting more than a little frustrating and so it was all the more satisfying when Burnie appeared in the stairwell. That brief triumph was short-lived as Burnie joined Patu as a punching bag. \n\n\"Jesus fuck, I thought we were good at this.\" Patu groaned as he slid down the wall, blood pouring into his eye from a cut on his forehead. Burnie chose not to answer as he desperately avoided a flurry of blows that would have broken important bones. While the cybernetically enhanced driver could dodge most of her attacks, he had even less luck than Patu did when it came to responding. Their efforts had resulted in some mussed hair and the slightest of bruises on her cheek. It would have been hilarious if they weren't fearing for their lives. A janitor wandered past with a jaunty step and a pair of headphones on, seemingly ignorant of the battle raging up and down his halls. \n\n\"Listen, you two seem like nice guys.\" The assassin offered, bending in half to avoid a hay-maker. \"How about you head on home and put some ice to those shiners?\" She suggested. Her tone was utterly casual even as she turned aside a mystically enhanced greenstone club with as much effort as she would yawn. \"Otherwise, I'm going to have to do something you'll both regret.\" It seemed more like a commiseration than a threat, though it was punctuated with Burnie being tossed down the hallway. He slid to a stop next to Patu and stared up at the panting Maori. \n\n\"Boys, is it handled?\" Jana inquired sweetly. The outmatched shadowrunners shared a long-suffering look before Burnie was hauled to his feet. \n\n\"Wow, I'll give you guys this: You're stubborn.\" Their foe congratulated them, barely a sheen of sweat on her skin. \"This has been fun but I think we all know how rounds two through ten are going to go down.\" She gestured at her bruised foes with a chuckle. \"You're out of your league. You can't beat me.\" It was a justified claim, the runners felt. They looked at each other, shrugged in agreement and drew their guns. The assassin went very still. \"Oh.\" She said in a small voice.\n\nThe suppressed shots were silenced further by thunderous applause as the final act drew to a close. As it was, Patu and Burnie barely had time to hide the body before people were pouring through the halls again. They rendezvoused with their team and made the hand-off to B's crew, with Kahu and Jana waving their goodbyes to Sali-bull. A final payment chimed into each of their accounts with a bonus to boot. It was only when the team had gathered in Burnie's new limousine that a question was asked.\n\n\"Jana, you handle the dwarf?\" Kahu asked, her mind still entrenched in professional mode. Jana laughed mockingly and dropped her gloves into her lap, the stun pads still smoking slightly.\n\n\"He dropped like a sack of potatoes, the poor thing. Did you geek the hacker?\" Her only response was a curt nod. Jana relaxed into her chair with a satisfied smile before pausing. She looked between Patu in the back seat and Burnie in the driver's, taking in their battered countenances with a degree of sadistic curiosity. \"What happened to the two of you?\" She asked, laughter barely restrained. Burnie glanced at Patu in the rear view mirror and a silent agreement was made as they both spoke at once, the car pulling back onto the road with a low hum.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\nEdited: Added a link to the previous part. Fixed spelling flubs. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5xe8v9/dd_5e_homebrew_props_to_a_first_time_dm/",
        "text": "My group had a DM for a while that was decent but very uninspired and had a tendency to put off prepping for the game (Curse of Strahd), or would cancel for obscure and lame reasons. We eventually got tired of his lack of enthusiasm and parted ways amicably. So we hunted for a new dm. It wasn't long before we found one. \n\nHe was very transparent that it was his first time as a DM but had lots of experience as a player. He'd built his own homebrew world and presented it to us with a bit of history. Even offered a trial run to see how he does things. We loved it. It was a fantastic experience and we continued the story from there. \n\nThe only complaint I had was that everyone had their own characters they made but nobody wanted to play the pre-made Vengeance Paladin character. I had originally wanted to play a Dragonborn paladin, so I figured I'd step up and play his human paladin and committed to it. But the backstory and character personality traits basically made him out to be a meathead. Low wisdom, low intelligence, midrange charisma. So I was an endearing meathead. \n\nI made it my goal to get this guy killed somehow. We're level 7 now and had a situation that tested my paladin's path. A Demi Lich gave us a mission to deliver a cursed Ruby scimitar to a red dragon as a move in their private war. It takes the entire party holding back my meathead Paladin from picking a fight with the Lich. But we go to the dragon. And when we get there, the DM plays the dragon perfectly. He fancies himself a God. Demands we kneel and pledge servitude. Most of the party does, but my Paladin only kneels to his patron God. And the ranger kneels to no one. The dragon insults us. \n\nMy paladin being the type to bow to no one and accept lip from no one, has had enough. I open up with everything I've got. And I was on fire with my rolls. The ranger jumps in as well. We both crit this thing about 7 times on some godly rolls, and the dragon can't seem to roll well to hit and his breath weapon had some low dice numbers. \n\nThe rest of the party just watched while we began to taper off and the dragon picked up some lucky rolls. It's an Adult red dragon, it was only a matter of time. The ranger goes down, I scramble to keep us both going but ran out of options. Eventually the breath came back and it kills the ranger outright. I've got one HP left and go for my last ditch effort. Not enough. I take a tail to the face. This is when the DM deserves props as he narrates the death. \n\n\"The party watches as your paladin fights with everything he has, all the while pleading for aid from his allies. The firey breath scorches him, skin burned and melted in some places. He stands tall but the dragon's tail makes impact. The paladin's body goes sliding across the dirt. With a determined look he gets to one knee and calls out to the party 'Help me you fools! We can do this!' but no one moves. With a final cry he raises his blade and charges the dragon a final time only to be beaten brutally into the ground by its massive claw. Unbelievably he again tries to rise. An annoyed growl emanates from the dragon, who leans its head in and in one bite removes the paladin's head.\"\n\nThe dragon asks the rest of the party if they will serve. They assent and are sent on a mission to the Dwarven lands. The session ends. At which point he informs us that the dragon only had 27 hit points left. A collective cry from everyone. \n\nI have to give mad props to my DM. He handled it all very well and gave my character a hero's foolish end. ",

        "text": "Everything was quiet. Too Quiet...\n\nOur recently assembled party had had a very strange day - everyone in this town was acting incredibly suspicious.  It was obvious something was wrong with them.  It was obvious they desperately needed our help.  But it was equally obvious that they were too terrified to tell us anything useful at all, despite our repeated (clumsy) attempts to offer assistance.  \n\nAll we knew for sure was that the time of crisis was approaching - possibly this very night!  And so we waited, and watched.  \n\nA cold wind blew across the open town square.   \n\nI shifted my shoulders under my heavy plate armor, and made sure my shield and weaponry were ready for immediate use.  I didn't know much about my party - didn't know how they would react in combat or how effective they would be.  But I knew one thing for sure:  If anything were to happen, it was **my** job to get the attention of whatever creature might oppose us and make sure it hit me instead of my companions - or even worse any innocent civilians who might peek out of their houses to see what was causing the commotion.  I glanced to my side, and saw that one of our party members had apparently wandered off - but there was no time to wonder where he had gone as it was then that we heard it...\n\nAn eerie music filled the town - and as if in response children began to come from the houses and gather in the town square, where I now noticed a sinister looking man was smiling and playing some sort of instrument.  He looked over the assembled children, pleased with the turnout, and began to turn to lead them off into the nearby dark forest.  \n\nSuddenly everything made sense - the sobbing parents of the town, the upcoming worry and urgency everywhere.  These people **knew** that this was going to happen!  They even knew **when** it was going to happen - and yet they had been too scared to give us any information or allow us to help.  I felt an overwhelming sense of pity for such people, too scared to even attempt to save their own children - and I knew I had to protect them, whether my companions assisted me or not.  So I stepped forward from my observation point and loudly demanded that the music playing man stop and release his spell on the children.  \n\nThe man stopped playing his eerie, hypnotic tune, and turned to face me, an evil grin on his face.  [Easy to envision based on the evil grin also appearing on our DM's face - we knew he was looking forward to this battle, and likely didn't expect us all to survive this night - and he looked forward to testing out his evil Bard against our party]\n\nThe man took a firm grip on his instrument, and opened his mouth...\n\nAnd let out a bloodcurdling scream as a huge greatsword blade appeared shooting out the center of his chest - severing his spinal cord entirely and spilling his blood/intestines to the ground.  \n\nHis body ripped almost entirely in half and fell twitching to the ground as our missing party member straightened to his full height.  9 full feet of massive, muscular Bugbear seemingly appeared from out of the clear night air, and casually popped a wriggling insect into his mouth to snack on as the children all around him slowly blinked their eyes and came back to their senses, and the twitching mass on the ground quickly gargled out some final words [important plot information to help us find his master and the true source of the evil in the region].  \n\nOur party shared a moment of proud triumph having rescued all of the children so cleanly and with of course no losses on our side - wondering briefly just how powerful this crumpled form had been to be so confident of success against our entire heavily armed/armored party - and if the sudden ignoble death of this man would warn his masters and make our future opposition significantly harder in the future.  \n\nHowever having no time to dwell on such unanswerable questions, we gathered our party and set off into the forest, to face whatever evil awaited us.  \n\n[And we shared quite an out-of character laugh at the look of sudden stunned defeat on our DM's face - served him right for underestimating the party and not noticing just how insane our 9 foot tall, grotesque mountain of bugbear muscle was with +16 to sneak and the ability to hide in plain sight and perform sneak attacks with a full-sized greatsword...  For those wondering - yes, he did take steps to prevent anything like that from happening for the rest of the campaign - but it was still a pretty funny first major encounter for our group]",

        "text": "Hello r/gametales! This is going to be a new series I’m writing about the homebrew d&amp;d campaign I am in. It will have an update once every few weeks. Any constructive criticism is welcome, I’m always looking to learn how to write better!\n\n*The Characters*\n\n**Nova (me):** Druid. A purple skinned Togruta, she is blessed with both immense beauty and intelligence. The only thing is, she was born unable to speak. She must write everything she wants to say on a piece of paper. Banished from her tribe at age 3 after being labeled a bad omen, she somehow managed to stumble upon The City. 16 years later, she runs a small farm and shop but has had no friends or family to confide in. She has major trust issues and was extremely lonely before joining the party.\n\n**Beeyatta:** Monk. A large wooden WarForge with an interesting weapon: live bees. Bees reside inside the inner workings of Beeyatta and follow his every command. He is the BeeForge. Every one of his bees is a trained monk as well. The honey they produce is full of regenerative abilities, but they’re constantly buzzing, making sneaking near impossible. Extremely peaceful, Beeyatta will attempt to talk our way out of danger before residing to violence. He does not understand emotions.\n\n**Gattsu (pronounced ‘Guts’):** Ultra Greatswordsman. He is a 6’7” human male, and his loyalty makes up for his lack of intelligence and wisdom. His sword is 10 feet long and extremely heavy…So heavy, most people cannot lift it, yet alone wield it in battle. He deals a crazy amount of damage with his sword, but a roll of 1, 2, or 3 is a critical failure. He is the bull in the china shop. He also hates magic users with a passion, calling them weak and unable to hold their own. He puts up with the group, though, and is even coming to like them. \n\n**No Name:** Fighter. An Incubus in disguise, he usually sticks to himself. Nobody in the group has noticed that he is an Incubus; in fact, nobody even knows his name. Whenever he touches a nonmagical object, he can enter a dream state and purchase that exact item forever. He barely talks to anyone but is willing to protect this group for reasons unknown to us.\n\n**Sand Snake:** Warlock. He is a tall Tabaxi cat person. Sly and cunning, he lives for adventuring and casually messing with people. He haggles everything and has extremely sticky fingers. He doesn’t have many points in either persuasion or sleight of hand, so most attempts at either of these things fail horribly. He worships a secret god and refuses to talk about him to anyone.\n\n*Quick Background Info*\n\nOur group met in The City. Huge walls encompass it and it serves to protect the last remaining peaceful beings in the world. The outside has become fatal terrain to non-adventurers because of the mass amounts of monsters and bandits. The City is very slowly becoming overpopulated, and something will eventually need to be done to fix this problem. During an annual festival, a woman was attacked and robbed. We chased the attacker outside the city and worked together to defeat the gang of bandits in charge of the attack. As the group is established, we decide to leave our mundane lives in the city behind to become adventurers (a rarity in today's society). Our first quest is to travel to the Lavender Mountains of the North to retrieve a magic dampening stone. About a month and a half into our journey, we arrive at the Frozen Marshes. This is where our adventure takes a turn for the worse.\n\n#The Frozen Marshes\n   We stumble upon a large village within the marshes. It is full of odd looking lizard people, which none of us have ever seen or heard about. We agree to cautiously approach the beings and attempt to ask them for assistance in finding the mountains. Bad idea. Tens of hundreds of armed lizard folk immediately swarm us as we walk up to their gates. They begin to handcuff us and speak in Draconic to each other. \n\n   Beeyatta, being one of the only ones in the group to speak the language, attempts to talk us out of our newfound predicament. Rolls a 12 on persuasion. The lizards begin to drag us into the city even faster now. Nobody fights back, as we are pitifully outnumbered. We all know it would be a death sentence to attack them now.\n\n   We are led to the dungeons, where we are all thrown in one cell together. They leave us our weapons and inventory, putting all of their trust in their well-built prison cells. Sand Snake is the first to notice an old, slouched figure in the corner. He approaches it and sees that it's another lizard person locked away with us. This one speaks to us in Common, and tells us that he was the former leader and shaman of this village. He was overthrown by his people, and they locked him down here as a new, bloodthirsty King took the throne. Luckily for us, the Shaman is full of useful information that he readily shares. We learned that if we wish to escape with some chance at life, our best bet is to have someone challenge the King to a duel. He informs us that the King is extremely hot-headed, and will be easy to goad into the fight. He also lets us know that he never fights his opponents fairly. \n\n   Driven to help our new acquaintance escape and save our own skin, we agree to elect someone to fight. After learning that the King is a physical, nonmagic fighter, we narrow it down to either Gattsu or No Name. Commence the back-and-forth on who should be the one to fight. In the midst of everyone arguing and Nova frantically writing her suggestions down, one well-dressed lizard surrounded by multiple armored lizards arrives at the prison bars with a sneer on his face.\n\n   We all notice him approach, and before Beeyatta can attempt to talk our way out of the prison, the thunderous voice of Gattsu echoes throughout the chamber, “Hey, fuck you!” Even though the Lizard King doesn’t understand a word of Common, he knows he was just insulted. He screams an insult back to Gattsu in Draconic while pointing at him. Beeyatta translates the insult to him, and tells him that the King demands a fight with him at the Grand Arena tonight. The King turns away in a rage, and as he goes to leave, Gattsu yells, “Eat my ass, lizard shit.” As the King sulks away with his head filled with anger, Sand Snake passes a sneak check and secretly casts a hex on him. The King will now have disadvantage on every strength check during the fight. Sand Snake grins and whispers, “If he plays unfair, we play unfair too.”\n\n*Later that evening*\n\n   Everyone in our party (excluding the Shaman) is brought in metal cages to the Grand Arena. The King is sitting threateningly on his throne with a trident in one hand and a shield in the other. Gattsu is released from his cage. The rest of us notice some lizards setting up a giant vat of boiling water. The King yells to the crowd, “After I win this fight, we shall feast well!”\n\n   The crowd is cheering now as Gattsu takes his place in the arena. The King stands and joins him in the pit, and without hesitation, makes the first move. He lunges and lands a hard bite. Gattsu pulls away, and with the King’s disadvantage on strength, he dodges his attempted second attack. With the King stumbling after the missed strike, Gattsu swings his 10-foot sword around like a baseball bat and lands a hard strike to his abdomen. 30 damage to the King after the first hit. Alas, the Shaman was correct when he stated that the King was a cheater, for he used his next turn to call for healing. The crowd threw multiple health potions at him, and he healed himself.\n\n   Unfortunately for the King, he was too busy healing himself and basking in the crowd’s cheers to notice Gattsu charging at him. He easily lands another strike, and all of the health the King just healed for is gone again. Dumbfounded, the King retaliates with a double trident attack. He misses both times. Sand Snake’s secret hex is becoming his downfall. The crowd is noticeably quieter at this point, while the cheering from our party is loud. After landing yet another strike, Gattsu easily dodges another two attacks. The King looks discouraged as if he is suddenly realizing the mistake he made by challenging this massive tank of a man. \n\n   Gattsu takes this opportunity of weakness and scans the crowd. His eyes stop at his teammates, and he screams out, “Here’s lookin at you kid.” His sword comes down on the Lizard King one final time, and he slices him clean in half. He just destroyed the village’s best fighter in less than 30 seconds. With a smirk, he shouts, “I don’t even like lizards for breakfast.” Silence permeates the arena, Gattsu standing over the bloody, mangled body of the once-King. \n\n   The silence lasts a few seconds before he lifts his sword in triumph and yells, “Are you not entertained!?” repeatedly. After the lizards realize what just happened, they release the party from their cages. Beeyatta hurries down to translate for him. “You are the new Lizard King,” he tells him. “I AM the Lizard King,” Gattsu mumbles. The first conversation between the new King and the lizard folk went as follows:\n\n**Lizards:** Oh, great King Gattsu! Please do not tell us that you must leave!\n\n**Gattsu:** Alas, I must go soon, but my first order is to bring me the Shaman from his prison.\n\n*The Shaman is dragged up after a few minutes.*\n\n**Gattsu:** Uh, this guy is gonna be your substitute King until I return. So yeah, listen to what he says.\n\n*The lizards obey and immediately begin worshiping them both as King.*\n\n**Gattsu:** Oh right! One last thing! Humans and Humanoids from The City are nice. Do not attack them as enemies, but as friends!\n\n*At this point, Beeyatta trails off as he realizes the implications of what Gattsu just said. The party is slightly panicking. Gattsu quickly realizes as well.*\n\n**Gattsu:** I mean- don’t attack them at all, we are your friends! Don’t attack the City People!\n\n*The lizards don’t question their new King about his blunder, but instead, agree to live a life of peace towards The City.*\n\n   That night, the party eats and drinks well. We celebrate with our new lizard friends, and the former King’s body is left in the arena as a warning to those who would dare challenge the new Lizard King Gattsu to a fight.\n    In the morning, we all say our goodbyes and exit the city with a chorus of praise behind us. Gattsu doesn’t say one word about what he did or the fact that he saved all of us. He only smiles humbly as we continue on our adventure.\n\n   *There are many more adventures ahead*\n",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vef94/silent_legions_the_blizzard_part_3/\n***\nOur actors for this mini-campaign:  \n***Charlie Lockwood***, a young teenage girl who is stuck watching her four younger brothers because her parents are high-ranking execs and are rarely around to deal with them.  \n***Annabelle Boudoir***, a somewhat preppy daddy’s girl who had recently moved from Texas, where her father had owned a lucrative oil contract and made some good money.  \n***Raj Mulligan***, born in India and quickly finding himself in the United States of America after birth, Raj is still a ‘fish out of water’ compared to his other friends.  \n***JD Callahan***, the local ‘tough guy bully’ that really only picks on the younger kids he can threaten, but is generally harmless overall. Lives across from Charlie.\n***\nIt is February 8th 1978. The kids stand deep underground, face-to-face with their fantasy opposites around the campfire. The adventuring party is amazed to meet the ‘Storykeeper’ who has crafted their life’s tales. Raj is a bit taken aback that everything his mind had constructed is actually real. Anna and Charlie greet Frieda and Brunhilda, amazed at their likeness but also the weapons, armor, and gear they all carry. JD and his opposite Traje are absent, though nobody pays any attention to it. After all, they reason, Traje was kidnapped by vampires during their session the other night. The allure of the visit starts to wear off as they wonder what to do next, and the kids head to the surface. Brunhilda has a small moment of crisis as the adventuring group struggles to accustom itself to the ‘real world’, though the semantics of what is real for each of the groups is played up in conversation.\n\nRaj stresses that he feels this newfound powers swelling within him. The discovery of a vast other world that flows from his fingertips is a bit much and he had a bit of a nervous breakdown. He decides that if he can create and alter, it might help them understand the strange things happening around town. He focuses on receiving a sign or omen that may lead them on a path, and the group is startled to discover a dead bird carcass lying on the ground. It is surrounded by blood that slowly oozes back inside, almost as if the corpse acted like a sponge. Interested by this sign, Anna and Frieda lean in. Frieda takes the tip of her axe blade and gently tries to dissect the bird, but at the slightest touch its stomach explodes outward in a shower of gore and innards, a crimson-soaked bat screeching and flying drunkenly into the sky. The kids are greatly disturbed by this. Arguments start about what it might mean and Raj tries to explain how he created it as part of his narrative. It is at this time that a book materializes in his hands, emblazoned with the logo of D&amp;D atop it.\n\nAs the girls bicker and argue, the bushes nearby start to rustle, and a solitary crab spider scurries forth, scaling the chain-link fence and dipping down into the snow. The kids are taken aback, the girls stepping away from the horror but Raj fixed in position with the book in hand. The adventurers step into place, brandishing their weapons as the spider strikes, a flurry of legs and mandibles leaping at Brunhilda, who ducks out of the way. Snow is kicked up and scattered about as the kids try to stay away from the fiendish creature. Frieda strikes true with her axe, cutting into one of its legs. Brunhilda bats at it with her quarterstaff, keeping its vicious bite far away from her. The creature turns on the magic-user, fangs digging into the soft fleshy skin of the adventurer’s leg. The poison sinks true, blue-streaked veins carving a path across her skin as she doubles over in pain. A quick jab from the quarterstaff drives the creature away, and the girls break their spell as Frieda cries out in pain, scrabbling at the snow slowly burying her.\n\nActing without reason or thought, Charlie strikes out, her booted foot kicking into Raj’s leg. The boy falls into the snow, and the book vanishes. As quickly as they had appeared, the adventurers and crabs vanish, though there is a pang inside Anna’s heart as she sees Frieda fading away, the poison seeping away her life force. The kids collapse into the ground, none hurt but all feeling the heavy burden of multi-dimensional occurrences weighing on their young heads. They check the hole again, to see if they could return to the dungeon, but it is an empty drainage ditch.\n\nAll eyes turn to Raj again, the Storykeeper and master of the fiction now being blended into reality. Focusing his efforts, he reaches out his hand as the D&amp;D book appears again. There is a brief flash of a snowy canyon, a large ornate wooden door built into a mountain that blocks their path. His concentration is broken and the image is gone, but the girls persuade him. Gritting his teeth, he brings back the mountain door again. The girls move forward, trudging through the snow as an alien sun looks down on them from above. They push and struggle, getting the ancient woodwork to finally give way. Barely lit and covered in cool old stone, the girls stumble down the hallway. Raj hovers nearby, seemingly in a trance that cannot be broken without physical intervention. The first door they try for once they’re inside is unfortunately trapped, and the victim is Anna. A blinding light of pulsing blue and tendrils of deep purple flashes before her, seeping and pulling at her irises until her vision fades. Taking her friend by the hand, Charlie is determined to go deeper. This world has already claimed attacks on Jimmy, her little brothers, and now Anna. They reach a small room full of crates, and start tearing everything apart.\n\nThey are lucky, and find a set of sword and shield, and a crumpled old scroll. Charlie takes the sword and hands the others to Anna for safe-keeping. Determination starts to flow as the steely weapon fits perfectly into her hands. But the happy find is quickly broken, the door slowly opening. A kobold appears as the girls whirl about to engage it. It flits away into the darkness, leaving them at peace. But only for a short time, as the sound of its friends quickly encroach on the storage room...joined by the padding of an enslaved wolf…\n\nThe spell is broken by the phone ringing. Anna, Charlie, JD, and Raj are sitting at the table in the Lockwood’s dining room. Dice are scattered about the table, miniatures cast about the graph-paper map Raj had drawn for the session tonight. But also sitting on the table are a sword, a shield, and a scroll. The phone rings again...",

        "text": "This is one of my guiltiest/proudest moments in any DnD campaign I've ever played in.  It did *not* go the way I expected, and I admit I feel a bit guilty about it to this day...but I also can't help but look back on the incident with pride - as unintentional or not it was an epic victory for my character, even as it killed the game.  The tale occurred many years ago - but I'll attempt to recount it as accurately as possible.  \n\nHopefully this is a good place to post it.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Characters:**\n\n&gt;  I/Me - A half-elf Hexblade wearing medium armor and wielding a giant's sword (exotic weapon proficiency).  Originally designed as a second-line fighter to deal massive damage/hexes from behind our tank.  Alignment:  Neutral-Evil (will explain shortly)\n\n&gt; $ChainWarrior - A human fighter wearing medium armor and wielding a spiked chain.  This is the guy who said he would tank so I didn't have to this time...  Alignment:  Neutral-Good\n\n&gt; $PsychoGnome - A gnomish rogue, designed to do roguish things.  Alignment:  Neutral-Neutral - however the person playing him role-played him closer to Chaotic-Evil.  This will become relevant later on.  \n\n&gt; $Wizard - An elven wizard.  Unfortunately for her the game ended before her character gained enough experience to become particularly meaningful.  Alignment:  Neutral-Good\n\n&gt; $DM - Our dungeon master.  Had run a few vanilla DnD campaigns as a DM as well as various campaigns as a player - and wanted to try running a campaign in a world he had designed from the ground-up.  Allowed us a lot of leeway in what classes/equipment/etc to use as long as we could show him a published source book and convince him it wouldn't be too game breaking.  He also specifically allowed me to play my Evil character in this campaign, and found a clever way to fit me into the game world.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nOur story begins in a medieval kingdom caught in a titanic battle between Good and Evil.  The world had essentially 2 deities - 1 good, 1 evil.  I forget the names, but they both had physical realms within the world, separated by forests/mountains/etc - and of course they were locked in eternal war with each other.  However, no fighting was actively occurring, as each side was fortifying their respective positions.  Rumours abounded, of course, that the evil deity was laying plans for another invasion - and *someone* would need to go find out what he was up to...\n\nMost of our party consisted of assorted roving mercenaries.  Happy to battle the evil one in whatever small way they could, for their own reasons (money, doing good, etc).  I however was different.  I was secretly evil - sent by the evil one himself to spy on the forces of good and foil their attempts to do the same.  I also had instructions to attempt to convert more followers to aid in my task.  I was given a great deal of freedom in how exactly to serve my dark master - but was also warned to avoid major cities of the forces of good, as I had no way other than the lies I told to hide my true alignment from others - nothing that would stand up to any magical investigation by paladins/others.  Fortunately I found a group of mercenaries willing to accept me without questioning my \"Neutral-Neutral\" alignment, and we were quickly hired and sent off into the wilderness to spy on my master - far from the prying eyes of \"the inquisition\" in the major cities.  \n\nIt is important to note here that when I say \"Secretly\" evil, I literally mean **Secretly** - The other players in the campaign did not know my true alignment - only $DM knew.  I talked to him about it outside of our playing sessions mostly - and occasionally passed him written notes while playing (which did not seem out of place as we were all passing notes for what gear to buy/etc periodically).  It was a system that worked surprisingly well, and kept people from meta-gaming and becoming un-naturally suspicious of me.  \n\nIn first getting to know my new companions, I decided to bide my time and learn as much about them as possible - to determine if I could convert them for my master or if I might have to kill them at some later opportunity.  I also needed to learn their strengths and weaknesses - because of course it was 3 of them and only 1 of me.  Even before we left the first small town where we were given our official mission, I learned 2 things that were very promising for my task:\n\nFirst of all, I learned that although $PsychoGnome was actually Neutral-Neutral, he was extremely Sociopathic and already bordering on being more evil than I was - making him a promising target for conversion.  \n\nSecondly, I learned that $PsychoGnome and I both spoke the Draconic language...And nobody else in our party could understand it.  Again - very useful information, and very helpful for my mission.  \n\nI decided however to bide my time, and rather than attempting to convert $PsychoGnome on the spot I simply began hanging out with him and becoming his trusted friend.  \n\nCunning and evil as I was, I had no idea how quickly and amazingly this strategy would pay off a short time later...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Adventure Begins**\n\nOur adventure began much like any other campaign - we set off into the dark forest, and immediately began encountering assorted bandits and wild animals bent on killing/robbing us.  \n\n$DM actually had high-hopes for some role-playing in this campaign rather than just hack 'n' slash - however $PsychoGnome had other plans and often pulled out his bow and shot bandits mid-way through their opening speeches...  \n\nThis suited me well enough, however - as my character was always ready to kill people.  It also gave me a good opportunity to assess the combat strengths of my companions.  I was not impressed...\n\n$Wizard, of course, was a level 1 magic user.  Lots of potential if she survived long enough - but virtually no combat ability whatsoever in the initial stages.  \n\n$PsychoGnome had plenty of fighting spirit...but was ultimately not particularly impressive.  He did have a decent sneak attack but once battle was fully underway he didn't have a major impact on most battles.  \n\n$ChainWarrior was about as effective at tanking as I expected when I had first learned he was going to wear medium armor and attack from range with a spiked chain...which is to say that he was utterly useless for the task.  I can't fault him for wanting to try an exotic character - I did much the same myself here of course - but nonetheless I was underwhelmed by our \"tank\" who had less AC and HP than I did - and who also dealt less than half the damage even on a good day, as he was of course dex based...And who actively avoided going in range to be targeted in any case.  \n\nFortunately as my character was designed to deal massive damage I was able to simply smash the major threats and absorb some smaller hits - so my character was able to tank for the party as well as dealing the majority of the damage in each fight.  \n\nOur party leveled up fairly quickly - and soon we were at level 3 and actually starting to learn some of our basic abilities for our respective classes.  $PsychoGnome and I also found some sort of magical artifact that allowed us to communicate telepathically - I think $DM wanted me to hurry up and convert him because he was disgusted by the \"Neutral-Neutral\" character acting uncharacteristically Chaotic-Evil, and wanted a legitimate alignment shift...\n\nIn-character I reveled in how well things were going.  I also enjoyed the leadership position I was rapidly being thrust into within our party, and I laid my plans to convert $PsychoGnome and to either corrupt or kill the rest of the party when the opportunity presented itself.  \n\nOut of character I was actually starting to get a little bit worried about how I was going to convert $Wizard and $ChainWarrior.  I didn't really want to split the party - I wanted to keep our unit together, faults and all.  I also didn't want to rush things and end the campaign early, I wanted the campaign to play out slowly so we could all enjoy the journey.  I decided I couldn't justify *not* converting $PsychoGnome within the next gaming session or 2 - but I would wait to either approach or confront the others until later in our journey.  \n\nThings seldom work out as planned, however...And sometimes you just can't justify *not* taking advantage of opportunities that are thrust upon you...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sudden Victory is Thrust Upon Me**\n\nI had spoken to $DM, and he agreed I should convert $PsychoGnome during our next gaming session.  I told him I would probably wait until we made camp for the evening, but was definitely planning to do so.  \n\nOur day's adventure began much as any other - although the bandits of the area had learned that there was no point trying to scare or intimidate us to they simply leapt from the cover of the trees in a sneak attack.  Little did we know how different this day would truly become...\n\nIt started when $ChainWarrior tried to use his fancy spiked chain to *trip* his opponent from range - rather than just hitting him for damage.  He rolled a natural 1...  $DM decreed that he lost his grip on the chain while swinging and it flew out of his hands.  He then rolled percentile dice to determine which direction it went.  Turns out it flew straight towards me, grazed the back of my legs for 1d4 damage, and continued on into the woods.  After the battle we all searched, and *I* was the one who found the chain.  Being rather angry about being hit in the back, as I gave it back I gave him a stern warning that it had better never happen again - \"Or else.\"\n\nFate was not on $ChainWarrior's side, however, and a short time later in a battle against some crazed woodland predators he again lost his grip on the chain.  This time it didn't hit anybody, but again it sailed off into the woods...\n\nThis time, it was $PsychoGnome who found the chain.  Being the little kleptomaniac that he was - $PsychoGnome decided he was going to keep the chain, as $ChainWarrior clearly didn't deserve it, and it would likely fetch a few shiny gold pieces at the next market we encountered.  $ChainWarrior objected of course - more strongly than I would have expected him to honestly (though it is understandable of course).  \n\n$ChainWarrior drew his backup weapon - a Scythe - and began swinging the handle at $PsychoGnome for non-lethal damage in an attempt to recover his chain.  It soon became clear that whatever his shortcomings as a fighter, and despite his silly weapon selections, $ChainWarrior was far better suited for close range combat than $PsychoGnome - and he quickly gained the upper hand.  \n\nUnfortunately for $ChainWarrior - my character couldn't just stand idly by and watch my most promising ally get beaten up my some wimpy do-gooder scythe-wielding fighter.  I drew my Giant sword, and loudly told him to drop the scythe and stop attacking $PsychoGnome.  His response, though predictable, was foolish - He proceeded to take another swing at $PsychoGnome.  Not one to bluff, I used my distance from the ongoing conflict to charge him (+2 to hit, -2 to AC had it mattered) - and I hit him solidly with the handle of my sword (yes, non-lethal damage) - dropping him from full HP to 0 HP in a single blow.  \n\nSince he wasn't fully unconscious at 0 HP, he crawled away from me as far as he was able.  Rather than immediately following and finishing him off, I lowered my sword to my side and again tried to talk him down - telling him there was no need for this, and if he simply dropped his scythe and relaxed we would help him recover and work everything out peacefully.  Instead however he chose to drink a health potion and brandished his scythe at me again.  Naturally, I responded by walking over and knocking him out quite thoroughly, again with the hilt of my sword.  \n\nRealizing that we were in a bad position out in the middle of a hostile forest, we tied up $ChainWarrior (after all he was crazy and had tried to kill 2 of the party) and carried him with us as we searched for shelter.  We ended up finding an abandoned treehouse that was perfect to shelter in for the evening.  \n\nThat night, I converted $PsychoGnome to serve my Dark Master.  And then - seeing a gift-wrapped opportunity when he had one - my character turned to the now outnumbered $Wizard and offered her the chance to join us willingly or die.  Unsurprisingly (well, a little surprisingly to me out of character - She usually played our lawful-good paladin character and provided the moral compass for our parties in other campaigns) she joined us without any resistance.  Then, as we turned to offer the same choice to the thoroughly tied up $ChainWarrior...$DM and $ChainWarrior had a little side conversation and $DM took pity on him and allowed him to retroactively untie himself, steal back his weapons, and sneak out of the tree house while the rest of us had been talking (with no opportunity to stop him).  \n\nTurns out $DM had actually planned for this scenario - and we received a visit from the Evil deity praising my work and welcoming his new servants, as well as giving us our new mission to come see him in person for further orders (essentially continuing our journey just with a different end goal).  \n\n$DM also had an entire side-campaign prepared for $ChainWarrior (and $Wizard had she not sided with us) to return and report our treachery and build an army of Good to fight against us upon our return - however $ChainWarrior was pretty upset and fed up with our campaign by this point (I can't really blame him all things considered) and didn't want to continue playing.  None of the rest of us really wanted to continue the quest without him involved....and so the campaign died then and there in a treehouse in the woods.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am still proud of this campaign - the time my character single-handedly converted the entire party (minus the one the $DM magicked away to safety) to evil and killed the entire campaign - even as I still also feel a little guilty about how screwed $ChainWarrior ended up being in the situation.  (He did forgive me, we are still friends all these years later)",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nSO a bit of backstory, my players were in the underdark fighting hags in their lair, During the course of the fight i had the hag beg for her life in exchange for this magical stone she had, One my players denied it right away because he knew it was a trap of some sort, which it was. After the fight the rock fell to the floor, and one of my players right away said \"i pick it up\" i was like, umm are you sure. \"YES\". i asked again, you sure? Even the other people in the party were like, \"yeah tahts a bad idea\" He again said YES, so as soon as he picked it up i described it as the Stone and the player teleporting away, They knew the sign on the rock had something to do with the Astral plane. I really didnt think anyone would just pick it up and so i didn't write a story for that.\n\nHere is the idea i have. I want some highly powerful being to control this prison in the Astral Plane, Not necessarily a god, it could be, or just someone/thing powerful. The players will have to use their Githyanki contacts to bring them there, Now i dont want them to have to fight to break him out, but i want the players to have to give something up, or do something to release the player from the prison.\n\nThe God/Ruler will be like the Judge of the Universe and will know of all the horrible things the players have done in their life and will also judge them, also he wont necessarily be evil, in fact he will probably be Neutral of some sort. Also one of the things that i spoke about to my player (the one that was transported) is that he will play the GIthyanki who will transport the players to the Astral Prison and he LOVES the idea, As soon as they meet their friend i will take over the Githyanki as an NPC and he will control his old character back.\n\nSO i need help from you guys fleshing out this Prison, The God/Ruler and cool things that could happen.\n\nFYI we are playing D&amp;D 5e with 5 players that are almost level 6.\n\nAll ideas are welcome. Thanks in advance.\n",

        "text": "tl;dr First time playing Ironman mode gave me quite the ride  \n  \n **Setting the stage**  \nI just recently got back into the game with all of the Utopia hype and was wanting to playtest a new strat (wanted to emulate the new biological ascension path by trying to rush genetic modification). Restarted a few times due to bad starting spawns. Ended up being kinda close to FEs but not directly adjacent like in previous tries so figured should work out. Fast foward 100 years. Then one awoke. I had a buffer empire but the AE actually declared war in the other direction so feeling pretty good about my 50k stack I went in, took out their main fleet, and captured a few initial planets to get a foothold. I peace out then when truce expires go in for the kill. Managed to defeat them easily and then hit “best possible outcome” when it popped up assuming I got everything like I proposed (found out later the buffer empire snuck in and captured the capitol planet after I took out everything so I didn’t get it…).  \n  \nFast forward a few years and I had rebuilt stronger than ever, up to 75k fleet (mixed but mostly 522s). So decide to declare war on the military isolationist FE north of me since my borders were starting to get close and in previous plays they had jumped on me and purged everything… So I go in guns blazing and am immediately met with a 100k stack that I manage to defeat with 25k left. At this point my rival south of me decides to declare war (they really are good about pouncing on you when you’re down). I try to truce with the FE but hadn’t taken enough yet so run down to take care of the upstarts. Normally their 15k fleets would have just been annoying but along with their allies took most of my remaining strength to put down. I wasn’t too concerned since mineral income was +770 at that point and could rebuild fast… But then game decides to test me.  \n  \n**The arrival**  \nRight as I’m finishing with these upstarts the Unbidden decide to purge my galaxy… Supposed to be pretty random spawn right? Well they decide to spawn smack dab in the middle of my stellar empire at my weakest military point in the game…. You’d think the galaxy would be concerned about interdimensional invaders and want to help out. Nope. The galaxy gave fuck all about me and mine. Ended up losing 2/3rds my empire and now my core and 2 sectors are separated by a red mass of alien invaders. My economy and military are crippled, I can barely make enough to make 1 cruiser in the time it takes to build it so I start the slow process of rebuilding and biding my time. I decide to join a federation in the hopes of getting back up but besides getting access to the 20k federation fleet they don’t seem to care that much about the Unbidden since its not an official war. They did help fend off the FE from before when he kept trying to humiliate me so that helped. Thought I could pop in and destroy the portal real quick while they were distracted but apparently that is no longer possible while anchors are up… many loyal plantoids died to bring me this information. The Unbidden’s response time is impressive. As soon as a military vessel entered the portal system they would all appear from the different corners of their conquest and I saw what I was up against… 6 60k fleets and 2 100k fleets. Normally I would have restarted from a save prior to my initial invasion but… my first ironman playthrough would not take it easy on me. And so in an effort to find out just how long I could last I settled in for a long campaign…  \n  \n**The Resistance**  \nMy first goal was setting up a defense to slow them down. My main shipyard happened to be a  4 planet system so I build a double fortress trap in between the 4 spaceports and waited while I rebuilt. They seemed to be not pressing in on my core territory just yet, still eating their way through my sectors. I managed to build up to a 40k fleet of pure 522 cruisers as I had  been told those are most efficient and I needed every advantage I could get. I sent out construction ship spies to monitor the progress of the purging and sent my science ships scouring the galaxy for help. I came across the enigmatic fortress and swung down the destroy it in hopes the enigmatic deflectors and cores would help give me an edge (other leviathans in the game were the Dimensional Horror, Automated Dreadnaught, Stellarite Devourer which I had previously killed and the Wraith which I was never able to track down). \n  \nComing back from my kill and feeling slightly better about my future my construction spy reports an assault on one of the anchors! Holy crap, the inhabitants of the galaxy actually seem to give a shit about surviving. I speed over and approach from a different side than the action so can take out the anchor while the fodder distracts the Unbidden fleet. Then the game decides to troll me yet again… one Unbidden stack decides to attack my trapped system… while there is no fleet present. I fly up there asap and bring along my federation fleet as I had just come up on my command rotation. We manage to take out the stack before it purges any planets but the damage is done… all of my fleet academy/assembly yard spaceports are gone.  \n  \nFigure this is a good opportunity to take out the other anchors while I have almost nothing left to defend… So using the same distraction tactics except with my own troops I manage to pull off the defending fleet and then swoop in with my main fleet from another direction to take it out. My severely outnumbered fleet entered into combat right before leaving the system so there were a few nailbiting days waiting for emergency FTL to be avail… Made it out of there with about 20k left but the mission had been accomplished. With the anchors destroyed the Unbidden seemed content to stay on defense in systems around their portal. I took the opportunity to slowly rebuild my spaceports and get my doomstack going again. I start getting a little cocky and thinking about life in the galaxy without the Unbidden menace so I decide to start trying to colonize again before the fuckers next to me claim any more of my previous territory. So I send out 2 colony ships to planets on the edge of my core territory and nearest sector. A few years pass and it seems to be going well… but then the Unbidden got hungry.  \n  \nThey sent in an attack fleet to each of my new colonies. I thought all hope was lost but I decide to try the distraction technique… x 1000. So I spent literally the next hour queing up orders to go back and forth into and out of the new systems so that the attacking fleet would leave the defending world alone for a second. I was amused it was working but it was tedious. Finally it was my rotation for the federation fleet again. Though down to a pitiful 10k I hoped it was enough combined with my 40k 522 stack to take out the 62k Unbidden fleet harassing my nearest colony. I decided to take the attack to them as they appeared to not want to come into my newly rebuild trapped system… I can report overwhelming success. Casualties were minimal only losing a few cruisers. Thank you to the theorycrafters who did all the testing! However, I am only human… while I was distracted with the main offensive, my second distraction unit ran out of harrying orders and my second colony was lost to the purge. I will likely have to rewrite the history books to make it seem that tragedy was inevitable and not due to gross negligence on the part of their ruler Stalks of Blue.  \n  \nI buffed up my attacking fleet to 50k since I would be losing the federation fleet soon and started my new mission: isolate the enemy fleets and take them out one by one. I was confident I could take out the 60k fleets due to the outcome of previous battles but the 100k fleets would remain a problem. The next few months were intense, drawing the individual fleets out and taking them on then trying to get out before reinforcements arrived. Finally the moment came to assault the portal. Only 2 100k fleets were left and I was confident I could get to the portal at least before they converged on me. So the assault began… and was pulled off! The portal was destroyed and our galaxy was saved and whats this?! The combined fleets of the galaxy actually show up to back me up against the remaining 2 fleets… Guess they just needed to see someone with the balls to attack them before coming in for the glory.  \n  \n  \nThis point was a long time coming… literally about 8 hrs IRL most of it spent cursing and resenting this game and swearing I would never play again cuz fuck that shit… When the moment came and I actually managed to overcome the obstacle against all odds how did I feel? I have never been so exhausted mentally and emotionally but fuck did it feel good to accomplish what I hadn’t thought possible. Would I play again? Fuck yes, Utopia looks awesome. Am a taking a break? You’re God damn right. Though with all the buzz about the New Horizon mod I’m not sure how long that will last…  \n  \n**The End**  \nHow did the game end you might be wondering? Revenge that’s how. Had to drop the federation as they weren’t in the mood for galactic domination and revenge for some reason. My first stop was taking back the AE capitol planet that my asshat neighbors stole from under me. With that construction base the previous decades long  campaign would likely not have been as brutal… Next take out that annoying as hell isolationist FE that declared war on me, I shit you not, 4 times while the galaxy was being invaded my interdimensional beings bent on purging the galaxy. You would think there would be more important things than humiliating your neighbor…  My wrath was terrible, my retribution… not so swift but revenge is a dish best served cold. No quarter was given, no mercy was shown. The foundries of the enemy became my own and fueled my future conquests. Lastly I flew down to put in their place the upstarts that had opportunistically declared war on me before the invasion. Their child sized fleets amused me. With my revenge complete I looked next to development and managed to improve my empire’s core sectors back to their former size, if not former glory just yet. The irony is that my initial strategy and effort had been around genetically modifying all of my planets to suit their purpose. All of my industrious, thrifty, intelligent, and even natural engineer/physicist/sociologist pops perfectly suited to their climate… wiped from existence. Guess that will teach me to play at being God. \n \nIf you made it this far holy shit. Thanks for reading, hope my suffering can provide you with some amusement on this Monday afternoon. Imma hit the gym and blow off some steam, typing this up has brought up all of my frustration from yesterday. Have a good one!\n",

The morning dawned bright and beautiful; as I write this, the first rays of sunlight play across the page. My hand and heart are filled with warmth at the sight of such a wonderful day. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday we had the pleasure of meeting a few more of the townsfolk, including a temperamental smithy, a very angry shopkeeper, and a truly amazing elf named Shalelu. I’ve never met anyone like her, young and fierce and smolderingly beautiful. When she’s not busy enthralling the locals, Shalelu acts as an unofficial scout, guard and advisor for the town of Sandpoint. She was already aware of the recent troubles, and had disturbing news. We were invited to attend the debriefing, and joined the sheriff and mayor once again in the town hall. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShalelu reports unusual and worrisome behavior from goblins in all the surrounding areas. Violence and attacks are on the rise and people everywhere are frightened. Even more concerning, she reports that the five main tribes are banding together, working together, and organizing themselves in ways never seen before. Someone – some unholy soul – is clearly behind this. But who?!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith the town and its citizens in danger, the sheriff immediately asks the mayor for permission to visit the neighboring city and gather reinforcements. The towns regular guard might be fine for settling arguments and jailing the odd drunk, but they are wildly unprepared to deal with organized goblin invasions. Were it not for the timely arrival of Adrial, Barbie, Sirus, Rye and myself, the attack at the Swallowtail Festival would have practically destroyed the town. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI could not have been more honored when the sheriff asked us to stand and protect the town in his absence; your youngest child has been become an Honorary Deputy! We all agreed, after negotiating some steep discounts with the local merchants. There was also some talk of a small salary – being a hero is well and fine, but a bit of extra coin wouldn’t come amiss in these trying times! Should this prove lucrative, I will send along as much as I can for you and the rest of the family. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOutside once again, Adrial had apparently taken the sheriff’s words to heart – he rode through the town on his new steed gathering the attention of several local youth. Once enticed, swordsmanship lessons commenced. I can’t say it was a major success, but things definitely could have gone worse. If push comes to shove, these young men will have a fighting chance if the goblins attack again, thanks to Adrial’s instruction. As an added bonus, the rest of us were able to enjoy some much-needed levity. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe went back to the Rusty Dragon for lunch, and were enjoying a lovely plate of boar meat sandwiches and jugs of ale and cider, when an angry stranger crashed into the room. He demanded to know where his daughter was – for a moment, all eyes turned to Adrial. He subtly shook his head, and Sirus asked the stranger who his daughter might be, so we could help in the search. The man spun towards us and began shouting. “Begone, vagrants! You have no business in this town. How dare you sully our streets with your filthy boots?”&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmeiko emerged from the kitchen, fire dancing in her almond eyes and a soup ladle clutched in her right fist. Angry energy sparked from her being – any smart person would have backed away. But this man did not hesitate. They met at the bar, toe to toe, hissing angrily in a heated argument. When the man pointed emphatically at our group and cursed loudly, Ameiko smashed him on the side of the head with the large ladle. Talk about dinner and a show! As he turned to leave, I took a moment to stretch my legs and *might* have accidently (intentionally) blocked his path. Stumbling and swearing, the man left in an ungraceful and angry storm. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmeiko stood for a moment, considering his retreating shadow, then tossed the ladle, slightly dented, into a pile of dirty dishes. “That will need to be washed; jackass stew isn’t on the menu.” Laughing, the entire dining room cheered as she sauntered back to the kitchen. We later learned from a group of locals that the man was none other than Ameiko’s father – one of the founders of the town and the wealthy owner of the local glassworks. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith the afternoons drama fast receding, Adrial and Rye decided to patrol the town while Barbie, Sirus and myself went to the local theatre. Barbie wanted to kill some time, Sirus was looking forward to the show, and I was anxious for a chance to see what sort of drivel that idiot Dorkkus had put together. As expected, it stunk. While Sirus and the rest of the town were wildly enthusiastic with their praise, I must assume this is because they wish to spare the feelings of Dorkkus and his actors. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe had no sooner found Adrial and Rye than a panicked woman ran into our midst, begging for help. It seems that her young son had been complaining of monsters for a few days and had not been sleeping well. Frustrated and furious, his father had stormed into the room earlier that evening to settle the monster myth once and for all. Moments later there was a retched scream, and horrible yelp, and a sudden, billowing silence. The young boy emerged, crying desperately that the monster had eaten his father. She showed us the bite mark on the boys arm, her hands shaking with terror. “Will you come, please?” the woman begged us. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe went, of course. Fear not, mother and father: I travel now in the company of fine, strong friends – the hero’s of Sandpoint will not be frightened by a closet monster. Even if it is the father killing variety…&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the boys’ bedroom we found a dead dog, the bloodied body of a man, alive but just, and a gaping hole in the closet floor. Moments later, a goblin burst through the hole. Mad eyes rolled in sunken sockets. The goblin had been hiding under the house since the Swallowtail Festival attack and apparently had gone mad with hunger and fear. Bellowing, it charged our group with a small blade. Adrial and Sirus finished it off without breaking a sweat before pulling the father into the hall for medical attention. Sirus carefully moved their beloved rover to a peaceful spot under a tree – hopefully the boy will be spared seeing the body, and the dog can receive a proper burial. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe took with us the body of the goblin, so that his corpse could be hung and serve as a warning to those who would come to cause trouble. The town of Sandpoint will not fall to the likes of goblins! Daverin, the stable-keeper and fellow goblin hater, was more than happy to hang the body for us – his wall was already equipped with a hook for just such purposes. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs I finish this letter, the sun has reached a peak and my stomach is beginning to rumble – I shall leave you here, and go in search of some breakfast. I’m hoping to entice Ameiko to make pancakes this morning. As much as I’ve enjoyed it, a gnome can only eat so much boar!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWillow &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5xu2l0/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "text": "Foreword and Character Introductions: https://redd.it/5wbtuy\n\nAn Errant Detail:  Totally forgot to mention most character's races.  The Punchist is, of course, a half-orc.  Sabre is a half-elf.  Sleuth is a standard elf.  That is all.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n**GM:** *Whether for riches or excitement, the thrill or the blood, you crave adventure!  Some prefer to travel alone, but others recognize the benefit of teamwork, and you are one such team.  As with all things, your motivations vary, but together you have been through many trials and seen your share of riches.  You may even mistakenly believe that you’ve seen it all!*\n\n*You will soon be very wrong…..*\n\n*Welcome to Steepside!*\n\nSteepside is a town located on a major trading route along The Barricade, a massive stone wall created from a coastal mountain range by ages of erosion from a furious sea.  It was prosperous once, but seems to be aging poorly.  The party notices this as they enter town.  Everything is shabby and mostly abandoned.  It's dark save for the light at the local tavern and a strange red beacon atop the high cliff outside of town.  \n\nDrinking is always the most educational thing to do on an adventure, so our heroes pay the tavern a visit.\n\nThe tavern has a big common room with a fire pit in the middle and a bar on the west side.  The bartender is named Garlo and has \"former adventurer\" written all over him.\n\nThe Half-Orc With No Name, \"The Punchist\", approaches Garlo.\n\n**Punchist:** *Get me a mug of that piss warm chango!*\n\n**Garlo** *I don't know what that is.*\n\n**Punchist** *(Obviously confused) Me neither.....*\n\nGarlo becomes impatient waiting for a real order.  Big P points at a bottle containing a strange greenish yellow liquid.  There is a bear on the label.  He points enthusiastically at the \"bear juice\", explaining that he was *raised* by bears.  After a shot [and destroying his FORT SAVE], he is unphased. Calls it some good sipping liquor. Garlo seems impressed and offers another on the house.  \n\nMeanwhile, Sleuth approaches and decides to make friends with Garlo by showing him a magic trick.\n\n**Sleuth:** *Hey man.  Howsit goin?  Let me show you something.  It's this little trick I learned.*  \n\n[Performance roll failed]\n\nSleuth raises his hand and \"removes\" his thumb.  Garlo is unimpressed and demands that he order something.  Sleuth asks for a shot of the \"bear juice.\"\n\nThe half-orc, on the other hand, was far too impressed with Sleuth's trick.\n\n**Punchist:** *Hoooo-leeee shit.  How did you do that?*\n\nHe continues to gush for a moment about how blown away he was.  Sleuth finally takes his shot [and fails his FORT SAVE.  It was clear that Cory's dice, freshly acquired not long before this game, had not been housebroken yet.  This would not be the last example.]  He becomes rather tipsy very quickly and continues trying to bother Garlo.  \n\nBig P leans over and asks Garlo why the town is falling apart.  Exasperated, as he has likely told this same story a thousand times, explains it's because of the light coming from the tower on the high cliff.  It was the laboratory of a powerful wizard and alchemist named Cromulus.  He came to Steepside 50 years ago, bought some land and lived there peacefully a while.  After people from the surrounding region began disappearing, Cromulus was blamed.  This was justified as he was using them in hideous experiments, as evil wizards tend to do.  The townsfolk go all riot-style on Cromulus, burning him alive as the light in his tower is extinguished.  50 years later, people in the area have started disappearing once more and the tower is lit once again.\n\nA massive green fist shakes in divine fury.  The Punchist does not understand magic.  He's cautious of it mostly, but will tend to overlook its usage as long as its not immediately used for ill intent.  Thudvik have mercy on those who use it for evil.\n\n**Punchist** *Magic man do this?*\n\n**Garlo** *Well, maybe.  We don't know for sure*\n\nThe half-orc's fist slams down on the bar and declares that he, his wobbly bard and his boy Sabre will go to that tower and pulp the wizard.  Sabre, lingering at the end of the line at the bar, takes exception to being called a boy.  This never sinks in to Big P's head and he continues to refer to Sabre as \"his boy\" for the rest of the episode.\n\nFinally noticing her, Garlo asks for Sabre's order.\n\n**Sabre:** *Just some water for me, but another shot for my companions!*\n\nAs the next round is sipped, the half-orc continues to be impressed by Sleuth's trick from earlier and begs to know how he did.  All the while, he is checking to make sure that he cannot readily remove his own thumb [Had he gotten drunk earlier, I would have made him roll to make sure he didn't actually pull it off.  Nick agreed that was appropriate.]  \n\nSabre pipes in and explains that Sleuth is a witch with fantastic powers!  Sleuth, unaware of what he was drunkenly agreeing to, went along with the comment.  The half-orc's smile drops into a worried frown.  The Punchist does not understand magic...\n\n**Punchist:** *You a magic man?*\n\n**Sleuth:** *Yeah, sure am!*\n\n**Punchist:** *Oh boy.*\n\nHe sits in panicked contemplation for a moment before becoming more optimistic.  He assures Sleuth that they'll get that mojo out of him and that beating up another magic man is a great start.  Big P grabs Garlo by the shirt and declares that they'll fix this town!  Garlo tells him to do whatever the hell he wants, but to be cool.\n\nAs it gets late, the party asks for a room.  Big P takes Sleuth aside and let's him know, in a hushed town, that if they can't get that mojo out of him then it may hav to be beaten out....\n\nThe morning comes and Sabre finds Sleuth and Big P in their shared room.  Sleuth is laid out on the floor, seemingly dead from bear juice.  The half-orc sleeps standing up in the corner, as he was raised by horses.  \nBefore departing to the high cliff north of the town, Sleuth gets a mug of coffee from Garlo, the half-orc hovers over people uncomfortably, and Sabre strikes up a conversation with a friendly but kinda weird old man.  He adds on to Garlo's story about Cromulus, but claims that Cromulus was never killed by the townsfolk, and that he lived on to continue his research for years, collecting mountains of gold under his land.  Sabre, seeing an opportunity to shine, lays on a touch of flirtatious charm to learn a little bit more.  The old man, blushing, shares that he had explored the ruins on the high cliff and found a strange old amulet.  He offers it to Sabre to wish her a safe journey.  She smirks as she examines it. It's a shimmering amber stone fitted into a small, mechanical brass fixture.  It's purpose is unknown, but she determines that it's got some sort of magic to it.\n\nThe party finally leaves the tavern, after Sleuth steals a full mug of coffee out from under Garlo's nose, and heads toward the town's north gate.  Steepside looks just as trashy in the day as it does at night.  They eventually make their way down a wooded trail that becomes overgrown and dark the farther they travel.  After nearly 20 minutes, Sabre detects a rustling from the bushes on the right side of the trail.  It is between her and her companions further up on the trail.  She detects yet another rustle in the bush next to the Sleuth and Big P and motions for them to exercise caution.  The half-orc ignores this warning and strikes up a conversation with the bush, asking if it's friendly.  The bush does not respond.\n\nMeanwhile, Sleuth has sneaked around the back of the bush, withdrawing a set of nunchaku.  In trying to make a sneak attack [Cory rolls a 1], he cracks himself in the back of the head while flourishing before the strike.  He topples onto the bush's occupant, a hooded man in dark clothing holding a sap.  Without immediately noticing this, Big P helps him up.  The hooded man tries to stealthily stick the sap in a back pocket to to talk his way out of his situation.  Big P sees this happen.\n\n**Punchist:** *That a beaver tail?*\n\n**Hooded Man** *(Obviously confused) Uhhh, sure.*\n\n**Punchist:**  *You a beaver man?*\n\n**Hooded Man** *(Playing along) Uhhh, yeah.  Yeah I am.*\n\n**Punchist:** *Hoooo-leee shit.  That is great.  I've spent a lot of time around beavers.  I was raised by 'em, you know!*\n\nWhile this is occurring, [as the result of a failed Perception roll by Betty] the figure from the bush near Sabre sneaks away and reappears behind her, clobbering her with his sap.  It does very little to stagger her.  Sabre turns to her attacker and unleashes Sphere of Flame.  [Rolls over 20 to hit and rolls maximum damage] The hooded figure is engulfed in an all-consuming ball of fire that plows down the path behind them after reducing him to a pile of ash and crumbled bone.  \n\nNot witnessing the cause of the mass of fire, Big P hears a short scream and witnesses someone burn to an ashy pile before Sabre.  This, of all things, makes him reassess the man he is helping up.  [Rolls Sense Motive and nails it hard]  He gets the impression of ill intent from hooded man and his face presses into a deep scowl.\n\n**Punchist:**  *You lie.  You no beaver man!* [Nick portrayed his dumbfounded fury better than I can ever hope to relay it here.]\n\nThe half-orc swings and the hooded man ducks quickly and produces a dagger.  [Initiative is rolled, but it doesn't matter.]  As he raises back up, Big P is ready and unleashes some Boar Style on his upper body.  The right fist connects HARD and smashes the hooded man's lower jaw, throat, collar bones and upper sternum.  A generous amount of blood splashes on to Sleuth's high-dollar vestments as the hooded man's body crumples on to the ground at high velocity.  The left fist, with nothing left to connect to, smashes into the tree on the right.  Determined to make the best of the situation, Sleuth searches the man and snags some gold.  Big P, still on alert, hears another rustling on the opposite side of the road.  [Nick decides he wants to call out to the bush to reveal its true form, but almost immediately retracts this request in place of a different plan.]  The Punchist makes a running charge and does a flying two-fisted Superman tackle on the shrubbery.  The bush is decimated and so is the poor sap occupying it.  He is pinched between the trunk of a large tree some five or six feet behind his hiding place and Big P's full weight.  The man's torso becomes a shapeless bag of loosely-affiliated bones.\n\nUpon closer examination, the party realizes that this man was not dressed the same as the other two.  No hood.  No dark clothes.  Just dirty brown rags.  [Nick confides that its probably best that The Punchist not ask too many questions about this man's level of involvement in the previous attack.  I confirm that is wise.]\n\nEnd of Episode 1.",

        "text": "First time poster here, just found the subreddit. Been enjoying reading some of other people's posts and I feel like this is exactly the kind of thing that subscribers here would appreciate.\n\nTwo details for a quick preface: in my world, Bahamut is the central deity and rules over the domain of life, and the PCs had a Helm of Teleportation due to an earlier side quest they took having a loot roll of 98 on a d100. It's made the game *interesting* to DM ever since.\n\nMy PCs were on a mission to hunt down a dangerous, crazed pirate captain in the area that they had reason to believe had stolen an artifact they were previously trying to retrieve. They were able to discover the location of his hideaway and concocted a plan to raid it at nightfall. When doing so, they found much less resistance than expected. After successfully capturing one of the pirates and interrogating him, they discovered they actually beat the pirate captain back to the cove, and that he was already overdue for return, so he could be back at any moment.\n\nCue the pirate captain's ship sailing into the cove. Unfortunately for the PCs, part of their original raid plan called for setting some of the shacks ablaze as a distraction. As the pirate captain sailed into his cove's port, he and the rest of his crew were immediately alerted to something afoot by a raging fire tearing through the makeshift hideout. Surprising him at this point was going to be difficult, but the PCs didn't even try at this point and engaged him head-on.\n\nOne of the PCs, a wizard who was new to the party, made an awful decision in hindsight to run to the front lines and cast thunderwave on a large group of the pirates. Not that he knew it at the time but the pirates were actually already weakened from a previous scuffle and this would have taken out nearly half their crew... if they didn't all make their save and barely survive the spell. As a result, they were all in prime space to strike him down, and then deliver a killing blow. It was the first PC death of the campaign and the entire group was suddenly quiet and unsure of what to do.\n\nComes to the Warlock's turn, who is the one in possession of the Helm of Teleportation. He runs up to the lifeless wizard and asks if he can hold onto the wizard's body and teleport the two of them to the temple of Bahamut they've visited back in the main hub city. This question totally caught me off guard and I ruled that the body was technically an object not being held by an unwilling creature, so sure you can do that. I told the two PCs we'll get back to you after we finish the encounter. The rest of the PCs - now two short for what I balanced this boss encounter on - struggle with the fight but do manage to obtain victory. We put a pause on that group, and we transition over to the warlock and wizard.\n\nI described them suddenly appearing in the temple, right in front of the large central statue of Bahamut, in the middle of the night. The wizard's corpse is still oozing blood all over the granite temple floor, seeping into the cracks and circling the statue's base. The warlock is getting doused in it as he hold's the wizard's body, screaming for help. The only two monks in ear shot this late at night run over and are unhelpful, at best, saying they can't do anything, he's already dead. The warlock throws the entire contents of his purse on the floor, getting the coins covered in blood, begging for them to do anything. The monks run off to find the head honcho of the temple and while they are gone, and the two PCs are alone in front of the statue, I decide to myself without telling the players that I will roll my own best-of-five death saving throws to see what happens. As I begin rolling all of the players are dead silent, wide-eyed, *why is he rolling?!*\n\nThe first two d20's are under 10. Fails. One more, death is permanent. Then a success, and another success. It all comes down to this. I roll a 12. A success. I describe an ethereal voice echoing in their minds: \"It is not your time,\" the voice says, \"you have much left to do.\" The warlock looks up and could swear the statue is looking directly at him when suddenly his attention is directed back downwards at a coughing, wheezing wizard. The head honcho returns with the other two monks and scolds them for not aiding this obviously alive but severely wounded wizard, and begins healing him. We end that session right there and all the players let out a sigh of relief.\n\nA few days later, outside of the game, the warlock player approaches me over messenger and asks about how multiclassing works. I go over it with her and she asks if she could multiclass monk, like the others in the temple. I tell her she doesn't meet the requirements currently, nor paladin, but she does meet cleric requirements and that would still make lore sense. She looks into the cleric class a little bit and gets back to me later saying she definitely wants to multiclass cleric domain of life, dedicated to Bahamut. I'm in love with this idea and think it's some of the best character development I've seen in a game of DnD, personally.\n\nSo the next game session we finally get around to having, the group all eventually meets back up and the warlock character eventually has this talk with the temple head honcho about what he could do to dedicate himself to Bahamut, trying to roleplay the transition to cleric in the game. I love it as a DM. They talk for a bit and eventually the head honcho reaches into his desk and hands the warlock one of the coins he had emptied onto the floor back to him - it's a platinum coin still stained with the blood of his wizard party member. The head honcho says, \"I feel that Bahamut wishes for you to keep this one,\" and then boom! I reward the warlock with the few hundred XP (they were level 4 at the time) he needed to reach his next level up, and right on the spot he becomes Warlock4/Cleric 1 and I explain to the player that the blood stained platinum coin is their cleric spellcasting focus.",

        "text": "In my time RPing, I've always hated GMing.  It requires too much organization and planning and I'm typically not the man for the job. That being said, I have loved GMing this particular adventure.  Part of it is because I've found a group that is enthusiastic enough to make it enjoyable.  They're not all super experienced, but they've caught on relatively quickly, creating the best group that I've played with in nearly a decade.\nThat being said, I'd like to start off with some character introductions. I've got a pretty colorful cast going and it's going to be helpful to know their backgrounds for the coming tales.  One final note:  This is a story in progress, so nothing will be revealed that the players have not revealed on their own.\n\n**Sleuth - Played by Cory: Novice Player**\nSleuth’s player is relatively new to RP in general.  He’s enthusiastic about it and his RP skills are pretty impressive once he gets warmed up.  Regardless, his character is going to be…. interesting.  Thus far, it meshes with nothing that we are doing, but I’m deeply interested in challenging myself to work it in to the story.  I have a few ideas so far.  Stay tuned on that one.\nSleuth is a rogue/bard that was very literally “born of the shadows”.  Stepping out of a dark alley in the nude, he assaults a man at the local Circle K across the street, taking his clothes. (As his player explains this, he uses his phone to play “Bad To The Bone” by George Thurgood and The Destroyers with perfect timing.)  Outside, there are two punk kids standing next to a time traveling phone booth.  He pummels them, steals the phone booth and travels back in time…..  To the setting of our game.  Of Pathfinder….\nBefore we get into the predicted Henderson Levels that this character may reach, I will say that our sessions revolve heavily around creative play rather than hard-line plots and angsty behavior.  Frankly, we prefer to aim for a certain level of humor in our sessions.  Either way, I’m confident that we’ll wedge him into the story quite well.  Thus far, his portrayal of the character has been quite entertaining.  \nMore development to come.\n\n**Sabre - Played by Betty: Apprentice Player/Aspiring GM**\nA rather attractive young sorceress who's background is unknown to the party.  What we have established about Saber is that she is very polite, if not a little condescending.  Most certainly rather manipulative as well, as she seems to be rather adept at avoiding conflict.  She wears strange tattered robes covered in embroidered sigils.  Its color has long faded to a dulled grayish hue.\n\n**\"The Punchist\" - Played by Nick: Veteran Player/Fellow GM**\nThis particular half-orc is, on paper, one of the most complex characters that I’ve seen.  But in game he’s just…. indescribable. Though he was freshly generated for this game,  it's not the first time he's been played and has a more developed background than the others.\nHe is a chaotic-good Brawler (a monk/fighter hybrid class who specializes in unarmed attacks) utilizing Boar Style, with very little in the way of equipment other than an enchanted fisticuffs-buffing battle kilt. He has a few other interesting mechanics that we’ll get into later.  \nHe was raised by wolves and so knows nothing of his past.  He has no awareness that he is a half-orc.  He doesn’t know his age, nor does he does he know his name.  \nThose who know him by reputation, just call him \"The Punchist\".  This is not without reason.  \nAs he grew older, he eventually stumbled upon a band of street fighting gypsies who took him in and raised him to adulthood.  It was they who turned him to the adoration of St. Thudvik, Patron of Pugilists. The Punchist wanders the land to spread Thudvik's good word through righteous deeds.  The bloodshed and crushed skeletons that tend to follow are considered collateral damage.\nIn the end, he’s sort of a well-meaning murderhobo with a heart of gold and is played to have a genius level of incompetence.  He’s the party’s big green lol-ercoaster/battering ram.\n\nIf you're interested to see just how weird this might get, stay tuned for Episode 1, which I will be posting as soon as I finishing sorting through the After Action Report.",

        "text": "So, i finished Far Cry Primal with 100% on hard survival yesterday. After some time on youtube i came across a random MGSV video. I was like, why didn't i play this game before? And i was really hyped to play this because i enjoy stealth alot. Long story short i start the game.\n\nPrologue:\n\nWakes up from a 9yr coma, hot nurses and whatnot, i was instantly HOOKED! Then the girl assassin comes, kills the doc, and the bandage dude comes out of nowhere to fight her off.\n\nFrom this point on it just gets worse and worse..\n\n+ this shitstorm happened 2 weeks after i woke up from a coma, why didn't the dude just say something during that time?\n+ the assassin pulls out a knife, WAITS like 10 seconds for the bandage guy to throw shit at her, only then she throws a knife\n+ when he sets her on fire, she seems like she's in a lot of pain, then NO PAIN, then painful again -&gt; falls out the window\n+ then comes a 5 minute period where the bandage dude just let's me crawl in pain instead of HELPING!!\n+ a little girl with a black straitjacket with sleeves on fire appears, then floats into the ceiling\n+ the elevator explodes, and the bandage guy is on fire which puts itself out for some reason\n+ a fire demon comes out the elevator and gets beaten by the fire sprinkler system\n+ after another 5 minutes of crawling arround, the bandage guy decides to \"fix\" my broken arm\n+ under the bed, when the soldier kills that guy, HE LOOKS UNDER THE BED!! nope, can't see shit cuz \"smoke\"\n+ another guy grabs my leg and says \"help me\" OUT LOUD, soldier shoots him, drags him away across the room, shoots him 3-4 times, comes at me, hears a sound, and suddenly forgets that i'm under the bed\n+ bandage guy flips a steel locker to jam a heavy door, instead of just locking it, soldier on the other side has a blowtorch\n+ at this point, soldiers still can't decide wether to instakill everyone, or look at them for 20 seconds and then shoot them\n+ then we both play dead in a pile of dead people by looking really alive\n+ soldiers come and shoot every single dead body covered in blood, except the 2 of us which are not bloody at all\n+ bandage guy pisses himself, oh wait, nope, it's an IV bag\n+ soldiers noticed the IV bag but not the guy breathing on top of it\n+ the fire demon comes again and is yet again beaten by a fire sprinker\n+ serious leg injury, fixed by stretching\n+ then i walked into fire and just stood in the stairwell while burning, untill the fire just dissapeared\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn my mind i saw only the broken fire physics, retarded enemies and a stupid plot story. Couldn't do it. Just couldn't do it. So this was the moment i bursted into laughter and just alt+f4'd this motherfucker. Uninstalled, deleted, emptied the bin.\n\n\nI can honestly say that this is the worst game intro i played in my life. And i know i should've probably kept going untill i got to the mission part, but i simply couldn't force myself into it.\nGreat athmosphere, but story wise this simply wasn't good enough for an above average gamer. Very unclear and sloppy.\n\n\nI'm sure the rest of the game is really good but that intro was too big of a turnoff. I'll always hate it from the bottom of my heart.",

While this journey has put many long miles between us, please know you’re never far from my thoughts! You may have already heard some of my adventures – don’t worry, I’m more than safe in the company of my new friends.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe past few days have been quite busy – I’m sorry it’s been so long between letters, but my opportunities for writing are fleeting. Yesterday morning we met with the sheriff and the mayor to discuss the recent unpleasantness. Sirus, who is a most amusing fellow, thought to find the sheriff by starting a small fire in the street. The mayor and sheriff were, of course, horrified. But to his credit, Sirur’s plan proved quite effective – within seconds of starting the fire, we found the sheriff!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur investigations led us to the town cemetery where we discovered one of the tombs had been defiled. Inside, danger lurked – two skeletons attacked as soon as we entered the space! My companions made quick work of them though, and we picked up a few interesting clues.\nWe spoke also with several sailors and a few locals. Barbie earned a spot on the wall in one of the more…err…colorful taverns by drinking a glass of “water” from a fish tank. My stomach is clenching just thinking about it, so I’ll spare us both the details. But Barbie’s iron stomach won the day, and earned the information we sought.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn pursuit of the nasty goblins and the mysterious long-shank, we were led eventually to the towns dumping grounds. It’s a bit of a long story, but we ended up spending the night there to see if any of the nasty creatures showed up. Alas – or perhaps thankfully – our night under the stars was quiet. The following morning on our way back to the Rusty Dragon for showers and breakfast, we were met in the street by Aldern Foxglove’s young squire. It seems the young noble has taken quite a liking to Barbie and invited us all on a boar hunt which, in the thrill of the investigation, we had forgotten about. I called upon a bit of our ancestral power to make sure we were presentable for Nobleman Foxglove. At the very least, we no longer smelled of trash and seaweed…!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo show his appreciation for our earlier help in saving his life, we were each presented with a horse. My own pony is quite a sweet creature. I’ve named her Lexington and I already know we’re going to be the best of friends.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe nearly met our match with the boar hunt – while one beast was expected, we stumbled upon a pack of five. It took all our resources and skills, and some help from Aldern and his squires, but we managed to vanquish the beasts. When we left it, the clearing was bathed in blood and gore and our saddlebags were packed to bursting with fresh boar meat.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBoth Barbie and Adrial were wounded but we managed to patch them up, and after a few hours of rest they were back in grand fighting form. After such a busy day, we were all glad to kick back and enjoy a feast with many of the townsfolk at the Rusty Dragon. The ale flowed freely, the smell of roasting meat hung heavy in the air, and I’m proud to say my stories enthralled the crowd for many hours.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis morning I heard some rumors about Adrial and a local merchant’s daughter. I don’t have all the details, but it sounds as though our group should steer clear of that particular shop – apparently the man doesn’t care that Adrial is one of the saviors of Sandpoint and is livid about the stain on his daughters honor. From what I’ve heard, her supposed honor was sullied long before Adrial came to town. I know we shouldn’t give in to the evils of gossip, but who could resist such juicy scandal? I’ll drop by the shop tomorrow – my supplies of parchment and ink are running low, and I hope a bit of charm can smooth the waters for Adrial and our little group.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ll be staying in Sandpoint for a few days yet, at least until we get this goblin business figured out. I know you’ll understand – I simply can’t leave these people unprotected. I know our nuptials are fast approaching, but don’t worry – I’m sure this will be sorted out quickly and I’ll be home in plenty of time to stand beside you.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGive my best to everyone in Whistledown! I’ve enclosed some stories that I think they’ll find amusing – I trust you to share them far and wide.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWillow&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5whkvh/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "author": "drummyfish",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vxxnv/my_far_cry_3_story/",
        "text": "I recently started playing Far Cry 3 for the first time and ended up playing it a bit differently than most people I guess. This is a story of how it all unrolled.\n\nI have already played all the good games, so I thought I would try a little bit of Far Cry 3 just to have some of that shooting action. I was excited, turned on the game, ready for the action, but nope... here comes the tutorial! Okay, let's do this fast, watch the intro, wake up in some kind of cage, some guy comes to me, starts talking... all I hear is blablablabla. Will we get to the shooting part now? Nope, first we have to get from the fucking cage... okay, my NPC friend takes care of that, finally I'll get to kill someone. Nope, he has to teach me how to crawl - crawl under this wooden building, now crawl under another building, now learn how to throw rocks, now he's talking to me blabla again. Where's the fucking shooting bro? No shooting until I explain every single control key in the game, okay?\n\nOkay, then he gets shot and I have to press space repeatedly to touch his face. WTF? Okay, nice, that's the end of the tutorial finally. I have to run away to the jungle. Freedom at last, nice! I get surrounded, fall from a bridge to the river and the screen goes black. Okay? I wake up in some kind of hut, there is a guy talking to me, like blablablabla. What the shit? I just wanna be shooting guys in a shooter game, is it that much that I want? He talks to me about some fucking tattoos, I don't want to hear about that shit, give me a gun. He takes me out and keeps talking, I'm not listening anymore. He then gives me a gun!!! Nice, can I go to the jungle now? Nope, we have to teach you how to climb to a tower and also how to shoot the gun. I know how to move and shoot, I have played shooting games before, you shit! I climb some tower, then they take me to some camp where we have to shoot a few guys and then... it's finally over. I can go now. I feel like I have won the game.\n\nSo after those two hours of tutorial I notice the graphics is shit. SSAO is really badly done, makes all the shapes have really strong black outlines. Also the depth of field needs to be turned off. I go to settings and I can't turn off the SSAO, it's greyed out and simply can't be turned off, plus there is no option to turn off the depth of field. I have to go to google and make a research about how to turn these things off. I turn SSAO off in the config file and also turn off postprocessing, since it is the only way to turn off depth of field. The game looks like Morrowind without postprocessing, but it's the only way I can play it. But it's OK, I don't care about graphics, I only care about shooting here.\n\nAt this point I am very pissed off about the game. Having played DOOM recently and seeing the documentary about how they were designing the game intro to be as short as possible, cutting every unnecessary second so that the player can enjoy the action right from the start, avoiding the cutscenes, I am really pissed for the devs of Far Cry to have wasted my time like this. I decide to play the game as a total dick.\n\nSome NPC in the game tells me about a quest I should go and take. FUCK YOU BITCH, I AIN'T DOING NO QUESTS FOR YOU! I steal a car and go to the jungle. I become a lone wolf that is on nobody's side. With my car, I run over the bad guys as well as the civilians, I do not discriminate. I park my car and get out, and am instantly taken down by a wolf.\n\nThe game turns out to be a challenge as I chose to play on hard difficulty (I grew up in the 90s so I've seen some shit in games). I am often taken down by two or three bullets, either from my enemies or from my \"allies\" that are my enemies too. The only souls I am sparing sometimes are animals, but I need a bigger bag, so I have to kill them too for the skins.\n\nI do only stuff that solely profits myself and I do not play any missions, ever. Turns out the game is forcing you to play missions by having the great majority of talents locked until you complete enough missions. But that isn't stopping me. I already have all the talents I could get without doing missions and that's good enough for me. I drive around the map and keep capturing the radio towers. I now have captured all the towers on the first island and I cannot get to the other island, because I think you have to play missions for that. I have however become strong enough to take over the enemy camps. I couldn't do this before as I only had one weapon slot, for a rifle, and only a little ammo, so even if I managed to kill a few guys, I died because I couldn't kill the reinforcements that came. That is no longer the case, I now have two weapons and kinda a lot of ammo, and I'm owning one camp after another. Every time I capture a camp and my allies come, I take a car and run over a few of them, then drive on to take another camp.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vt2de/dd_5e_the_tale_of_ulfgar_fireforged_or_why_you/",
        "text": "Hello fellow Redditors. Since my first story got pushed back (DM got sick), I figured you guys/girls/toasters/etc might appreciate the story of my first 5e session. To fully appreciate the story, I've gotta drop some background.\n\nUlfgar Fireforged was a Dwarf Fighter. He enjoyed working the forge for a large part of his formative years. That was until tragedy struck: during a village competition his forge was destroyed. He  lost his left arm and leg to the explosion, and the only trace left behind was a coin with a dragon claw printed on it. After crafting metal replacement limbs, he headed off to Durchvald, a country that was recently conquered by a group of warmongers, and whose leader (forgot name) branded similar coins.\n\nAfter arriving in Durchvald, he headed towards the slums to find the cheapest bar around to drink. There he came across a half-elf warlock, a silver dragon-kin fighter, a half-orc fighter, and a half-elf theif. They all had beef to pick with the Durchvald alpha, and had got in good with the Freedom Fighters (old leaders of the country). After backstories were exchanged, the group joined into a party and got Preston Garvey'd, \"The leader of our arms shop needs help! Go solve their problem.\"\n\nAfter 10 minutes of searching, the finally met the shopkeeper, Mr. Silverspear. His shipment of materials got swiped, and we were to get the guys responsible and do reconnaissance on the pier. \n\nOur heroes first decided to scout the pier, which was strangely empty. Since they all figured that was done, they went to reclaim the stolen shipment. Halfway to the marked location, the group was jumped by 7 gangsters. Throughout the fight the gangsters kept rolling really well, and the party kept missing their strikes due to nonlethal penalties. Finally, only the leader stood, with 3 party members knocked unconscious and the rest hurting pretty bad.\n\nThe leader taunts, \"Seems like Silverspear hired a bunch of pussies and a cripple.\" And Ulfgar didn't like that. So I decided I would just knock him out. I rolled strength to punch him in the face as hard as I could. After a Natural 20 (and some thought on the potential harm being clubbed by an 80lb metal arm), he had a concussion and got knocked the fuck out. Ulfgar then amputated his legs (he was NOT trained how to do this and it was a really bad job) and dipped him into the forge. \n\nChaotic Neutral is the best.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this, I've got more stories if you like, and be sure to leave feedback if you want.",

        "text": "[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vm35t/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeptember 24th&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRusty Dragon Inn, Sandpoint&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDear Jemma,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile only 24 hours has passed since my last letter, I’ve had enough adventures to fill several pages! What started out as a simple quest for new material took a quick and bloody turn; as far as adventures go, I couldn’t have asked for more! It’s probably best if you don’t share this missive with Mother and Father; I don’t want to worry them unnecessarily. I’ll write to them separately without the gory details. There will be no reprieve for you, Jemma – you may be my eldest sibling and wise with years, but I know your sense of adventure still runs strong. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe morning started simply enough, with a hearty breakfast, several cups of coffee, and a few highly amusing jokes from my new friend Sirus. The scent of curried salmon hangs heavy in the air already; I can hardly wait for the feasting to begin. Sirus seems suspicious of the dish, but has noted several times that he’s happy to try anything as long as it’s not pickled! Humans have the oddest notions about food.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI followed Sirus outside to take in the opening speeches. The mysterious Rye joined us, sullen and silent and still radiating that odd sense of hidden power. I hadn’t noticed last evening, but he is a rather sickly shade of grey – not the usual coloring of an elf. I hope the poor fellow isn’t coming down with a cold! Barbie and Adriel stood next to us, making casual conversation as the crowd swelled around our small group.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was the usual babble from Mayor Deverin, and Cyrdak Drokkus - the biped dolt - rambled on about his latest theatre production; how did such a hack end up with his own theatre? The sheriff was there, dour as usual. I stopped listening for a while, as a band of travelling sprites passed by just then and proved much more entertaining. When the priest announced the official start of the Swallowtail Festival, I followed the others towards the midway. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTogether we wandered the grounds, stopping to play several amusing games and win a few prizes. We slacked our thirst at a few taverns and headed for the church to witness the consecration. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the priest was beginning his speech, a scream tore the air apart. High pitched, malicious voices rose up and we felt tiny bodies scampering through the crowd. A rhythmic chanting swelled throughout the square. A stray dog fell with a whimper, his throat slit and gushing blood.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGoblins.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of our group is learned in many languages, including the filthy tongue of the Goblins, and he translated their chanting:&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins chew and goblins bite*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins cut and goblins fight*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Stab the dog and cut the horse*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins eat and take by force*&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins race and goblins jump*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins slash and goblins bump*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Burn the skin and mash the head*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Goblins here, and you be dead!*&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Chase the baby, chase the pup*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Bonk the head to shut it up*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed*&amp;nbsp;\n\n*We be Goblins You be food!*&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI really hate goblins. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPandemonium reigned. People clamored to escape. The priest dove into the church and slammed the door, as several more goblins rushed into the area and began to tear the square apart – emptying barrels, throwing food, upturning wagons, and setting one of the out-buildings on fire. Without stopping to think I rushed forward, drawing my hammer as I went. Around me, Sirus, Rye, Adriel and Barbie were also rushing into battle. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo discussion was needed – we knew what had to be done. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRye let fly a series of complex hexes, hitting goblin after goblin; they fell under the power of his spells, weakened and disoriented. Sirus raced towards the wounded dog and began applying field dressings. Once it was safe, he grabbed a bowl from one of the tables, filled it with water and rushed to the fire. I followed with another bowl, trying to stop the flames from spreading. Adriel and Barbie did not hesitate and showed no heed for fires or wounded animals. They jumped into the melee with weapons drawn. Barbie’s drunken stumbling transformed into an almost graceful flow of movements as she hacked her way through the enemies. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI attempted to inspire my comrades with tales of past adventures – do you recall the time we invaded the goblin camp in the west? Ahh, what a battle it was! As the story rang out, my companions’ confidence grew and their attacks strengthened.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEach cleave of Barbie’s battle axe coated the square in a new layer of blood – before long, nearly every surface was bathed in gore. \nFrom behind the table where he was battling the fire, Sirus yelled out “You, Goblins! I’m going to write down ALL your names!” Those still standing screeched in rage, while Sirus and I shared a malicious smile. In the distance, smoke began to rise and a beating drum joined the chanting. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen the last goblin has fallen, the priest poked his head out and surveyed the area. Realizing it was once again safe, he emerged and came to offer his thanks. As he touched us each in turn, we felt the most amazing sense of well-being – our wounds had healed. Doing his best to avoid the puddles of blood, the priest headed out of the square.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe followed the priest south towards the smoke. As we rounded a corner, the priest froze, gave a great spasm of terror, and bolted back towards the safety of his church. The familiar scurrying sounds of little feet met our ears. Resigned, we stepped forth once again into battle. Here we found several goblins with torches – no doubt the source of most of the fires - and the goblin drummer. Rye once again found a safe spot and started firing hexes. There’s no doubt – this elf has serious magic. Sirus joined in the casting, stunning and blinding several goblins. I continued my tale of inspiration, boosting Adriel and Barbie as they waded into battle. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce again Barbie and Adriel proved to be very effective in combat – the goblins were struck down before they even knew what hit them. At last, the drummer was silenced and the chanting stopped. Deep silence billowed around us. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I spotted a small, green head bobbing away. Hidden behind some rubbish, one goblin had escaped Barbie and Adriel’s savagery. He tore off up the street as quickly as his stubby legs would allow. Barbie cursed, Adriel laughed, and a panicked scream shattered the evening. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExpecting to find a damsel in distress, we were slightly surprised to find a young man crouched behind several rain barrels at the end of the road. Dressed simply but in obviously fine quality clothing, the man was terrified and screeching like a silly young girl. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe made short work of the handful of goblins, but kept four alive for questioning. Adriel, it transpires, has some skills in interrogation techniques. Frustrated at the lack of violence, Barbie trouped off towards the Rusty Dragon for a beer. The young nobleman seemed quite taken with Barbie and followed her down the street babbling his thanks and complimenting her battle prowess. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeveral of the goblins did not survive our questioning, but we had some luck with the forth; he said he and his fellow goblins were told to come here and tear the town apart. When pressed for details, he would only say that “some longshank” had sent them. We took the goblin prisoner and his disturbing news directly to the sheriff, and headed back to the inn for some much needed refreshment and rest. While Barbie and her new amour laughed loudly over a pint, while Rye sat in the corner and studied the picture of his mystery woman, while Sirus entertained the crowd with tales from his northern home and Adriel got quietly sloshed, I crept off to my room to write to you while my memories are still fresh.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd now, dear sister, I shall head to bed and hope for the sweet oblivion of deepest sleep. While I’m glad for the adventure and the new tales it will give me, I do hope tomorrow will be quieter – and goblin free!&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nWB&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5w4cu5/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5voppy/surprisingly_epic_combat_slog/",
        "text": "  So my D&amp;D group was missing quite a few players last week, and one of my friends decided he wanted to try running a one-shot. We had previously been hurled 400+ into the future, where a character we'd left behind had established a unified human-goblin empire. So naturally, this was a call-back session, structured around a festival in King Wolf-Teeth's honor. The main event was a tournament where drunk history versions of his deeds were re-enacted. \n\n  In the first scene, WF was carrying a dead hobgoblin to Icespire Peak to be resurrected (true.) Along the way, he decided to track down a notorious ghoul and defeat in a raging blizzard, saving humanity from its evil! The WF stand ins were blindfolded to simulate the blindingly harsh weather, and a real live ghoul was brought in. (In reality, WF had simply stumbled into the ghoul and pacified it with some hobgoblin meat, knowing it could be regenerated. He lost it in the blizzard.)\n\n  The second scene featured an ogre; the prize war machine of an army that stood between WF and pacification of a large area. My half elf warlock attempted to defeat it singly handedly with a well used phantasmal force, but mistakenly used the wrong language, and merely confused the ogre. The elven druid then turned into a bear, and with the help of our swashbuckling Tabaxi (cat person) friend, the ogre was downed. \n\n  The final scene depicted an honor duel between WF and a hold out bugbear chieftain who didn't want peace. He rode in on a sheep dressed as a dire wolf. Shortly into the duel re-enactment, however, the announcer started going crazy, insulting WF and claiming the natural order had been upset! Elves had become marginalized! Chaos needed to be re-introduced! The bugbear was pretty ticked, and stopped the duel.\n\n  Just then, five elves jumped down into the arena and starting chanting at the sheep in a frenzy. In the stands, elves took out weapons and began attacking people. Ronan (the cat person rogue) and Thia (the elven druid) moved to attack the elves, while the bugbear ... stood around stupefied? Thia, being from the past, had no clue what the deal was, but my half elf Gale was in on it, and tried to talk Thia into joining the cause. \n\n  Ronan was having none of it, however, and moved to stop the elves once again. Gale tried to put him to sleep, but failed; Ronan retaliated with fierce sword strokes. Gale retreated into the elven circle and protected with a dome via the plant growth spell. By the time Thia and Ronan had a plan to get trough, the plants began to wither from an internal fire. \n\n  Standing on top of the ogre corpse, surrounded by frenzied, mad elves, stood flaming monstrosity: the Hell Sheep. Gale gazed at this horror and realized the elves had been tricked: this was not salvation. He stepped back, and for the first time, managed to hit something with his eerie green eldritch blast. (It was the sheep.) He then shouted at another elf who was about to attack Thia, but but the announcer then screamed that Gale had betrayed them! The elves descended on Gale, and he was down by the end of the round. As he fell to earth, he finally understood the nature of the evil within his movement. \n\n  The bugbear, Bran, had the stats of a hobgoblin warlord (CR6), and with his help Thia and Ronan dispatched the hell sheep without too much difficulty. The stands were mostly empty now, with the announcer dancing about, stabbing bodies and going on and on with his lunatic ramblings. Thia and Ronan approached him, and he dashed back to the booth, shrouded in mystical darkness. When he emerged, he had taken his true form: a lobster clawed, mandibled, four armed menace. A Glabrezu. I happened to know this was a powerful demon with resistance to near everything, and so hoped it would fly away to avoid a combat slog. Bran (bugbear), however, made a fish based insult, and the fight was on.\n\n  The Glabrezu jumped down into the ring and we all started trading blows, Thia going immediately into her brown bear form. Bran knocking the demon prone with his shield and smashing with a mace, and Ronan getting sneak attacks on on his rapier. Once the characters figured out that regular weapons and magic had little effect, Bran told Ronan to go get WF's magic battleaxe: the would-be-prize for the tournament. The demon turned to chase, but Bran and Thia waylaid him, and the tabaxi returned quickly, tossing the axe to Bran. \n\n  WHAM WHAM WHAM! Three hits with the magic axe, and it looked like the Glabrezu was hurting. In exchange, it knocked Bran from 70HP to only 12. Then, the Glabrezu began to fly. It knocked Thia and Ronan around pretty good as Bran ran into the area under the stands: a concrete tunnel coated in charcoal, with load bearing pillars galore. The Glabrezu telepathed \"I want that axe.\" \n\n Bran shouted back: \"Come and get it!\" The demon knew what Bran was up to, but came into the tunnel anyway. Bran was waiting, and promptly slammed the axe into a pillar, even activating its fire ability. Both combatants were pinned in the ensuing debris, and Ronan got a sweet sneak attack before disengaging. Bran was near death, however.\n\n  With a tremendous noise, the noably wounded demon stood, shaking the rocks off in a thunderous cascade. Bran, too, stood. He charged at the demon and swung before turning the corner and attempting to hide. Ronan got in another guerilla attack. The demon tired of these games, and walked outside. I turned out that Thia had been knocked back into her elf form and was unconscious, but Ronan had stabilized her. The demon, with a single, massive pincer, picked her up by the neck and threatened to kill her if the other two didn't come out ant fight. \n\n  Ronan was first, with a guerilla attack. Next, Bran staggered out and bellowed \"I hear... you wanted to FIGHT ME!\" Bran wasn't very good with one liners. The demon dropped Thia, and Bran charged. One, two three strikes, two landing. The Glabrezu was hurting, but it retaliated, and Bran crumpled like a particularly dry cheese being smashed with a hammer. The demon picked up the axe, smirked, and began to limp out of the arena. Victory: Evil. \n\n   However, Ronan was not dead yet. At great peril to himself, he leapt from his hiding place and dealt a single blow to the demon's back.  As it turns out, this was the straw that broke the demon's back. To everyone's amazement, the wretched thing fell and begin to return to its world. The terrorist elves might still be a thing, but at least now they weren't being controlled by a brain-washing demon. Day saved?\n\n   Epilogue: It took several minutes for Thia to regain consciousness, and by that time the stadium was on fire. The two of them removed Bran's armor and hauled him out to safety, leaving Gale's corpse behind. The citizens were understandably wary of elves just then, but Thia was in such rough shape that they at least didn't attack her. And that's where we left it! It was just a one-shot thing for now, but it will be interesting to see if any of the consequences make it into the main game.",

I’ve had a very productive trip so far, filled with adventure and entertainment. I can hardly wait to return home and share my latest stories with you. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis morning marked the official start of the Swallowtail Festival in Sandpoint. I joined some new acquaintances for a tour through the midway games and hilarity ensued. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe began the morning at the Devil Hunt. Worry not – no devils were harmed! A wooden “devil” was set up and contestants took turns demonstrating their skills with the bow and arrow. I can fire off jokes with deadly aim, but my ranged weapon skills leave something to be desired; I watched from a safe distance. Barbie and Adrial were enthusiastic but clearly not used to the mechanics of a bow. Adrial missed the wooden devil entirely, burying the arrow in the roof of a nearby building and earning shrieks from a few startled locals. Barbie chose brute strength over finesse with predicable results: she snapped the bow cleanly in half and lost the arrow in the process. The proprietor promptly asked her to leave, and she staggered towards a nearby beer tent with Adrial following, shaking with laughter. Sirus and Rye proved more skillful, both hitting the target and earning themselves tasty treats. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWandering further, we found ourselves at a shabby booth called The Goblin Toss. I didn’t wait to hear the rules, but slapped my money on the table immediately and looked around for goblins to dispose of. As it transpired they were not real goblins at all, but crude dolls which were to be tossed into a hole. Sirus stepped up first, and used bizarre magic to float his dolls into the furthest hole. There were some mutterings of cheating, but no one seemed willing to accuse him directly. When my turn came, I’m proud to report the name Berrypipe was not embarrassed. I made two out of three shots, which was enough to earn a prize! Barbie, fortified by beer, was also successful, as was Rye. Adrial claimed to be too drunk to aim, and meandered through the crowds making lewd remarks to passing women. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince the fates seemed keen to keep us together, the five of us set off together down the lane. The next game had a crudely drawn sign with the words “Lighthouse Smash” done in bright paint. Barbie and Adrial both perked up at the word “smash” and they clamored to the front of the line. Rye showed no interest in the game, but could be heard harassing people throughout the crowd with the picture of his mysterious woman – has Jemma shown you the copy I sent? I’m quite curious about this woman and the reason for his desperate search. Perhaps she’s a long-lost love? Or maybe she owes him money.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdrial managed to knock the tower down in only two shots, and was given a toy catapult as a reward. I can only imagine the shenanigans he’ll get up to with that! Barbie was the next. Once again, her preference for brute strength in the face of fine craftsmanship failed. The first two shots missed by several meters. The third shot took an interesting turn, landing in a widow’s flowerbed; I can still hear the poor dear shrieking about her crushed rosebush. As the proprietor shooed our giggling group away from his stall, Barbie muttered to Adrial that it would have been more effective if they’d just let her throw the damn boulders. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs we moved through the street Rye gave a sudden, strange cry. A moment later, a large hawk materialized, swooped down and landed on Rye’s shoulder with a soft screech. Adrial, startled by the large bird, took a meaty swing but (thankfully) missed.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA ways down the road, we found ourselves at the most elaborate game thus far. A merrily flapping banner announced Dragon Races, and we all hurried forth to get a better view! Alas, no dragons could be found. Instead, we found a pen filled with brightly painted lizards and four racing lanes carved into the yard. I joined Rye, Sirus and Adrial as we picked out lizards and headed to the starting line. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe proprietor yelled “GO!”, the crowd roared, and the race was on. Adrial threw a piece of cookie down the track, \nhoping to entice his lizard with a treat. The lizard shuffled a ways before becoming distracted. Adrial shouted, startling the lizard (and everyone else!) and causing him to jump another few feet. Realizing he was falling behind, Adrial pointed to a spot in the distance and yelled “look, he’s making a run for it!”. When the crowd turned to see, he reached over and attempted to throw his lizard down the track. Unfortunately for him - but quite fortunately for the lizard – several people noticed and his attempt was thwarted. Frustrated with his failed cheating, Adrial bent down and shouted directly at the lizard. Terrified, the poor creature turned and ran back towards the starting line.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRye chose to make use of his feathered companion, and sent the hawk down to motivate his lizard towards the finish line. The painted “dragon” took a step to the side, cowered in the corner for a moment, then shit himself. Rye shouted in frustration, and the terrified little lizard turned around and scampered out of the lane altogether, heading for the relative safety of the pen and leaving Rye seething at the starting gate. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI chose a slightly different tactic, calling on the magic of our ancestors and my own humble powers of persuasion. I took a seat on the soft grass and chatted with the lizard, asking him if he wouldn’t mind please scampering down to the end of the lane for me. While somewhat effective, he and I got to chatting and forgot about the race entirely. We ended up stopped halfway down the track, deep in discussion about the latest trends in lizard husbandry. It’s really quite amazing how they’re getting the females to….oh, sorry. Back to my story! &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the next lane, Sirus summoned an unseen force and shoved his lizard down the line. This worked for a while, until the gathering crowd began muttering about cheaters and punishment. Sirus quickly changed tactics, and fixed the lizard with the “stern and menacing gaze of his people”. Thus motivated, the animal scampered straight to the finish line, earning Sirus a blue “First Place Dragon Racer” ribbon, which he pinned proudly into his mane of hair. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCatch the Greased Pig was located on the next lot, and was exactly as the name described. Adrial and Barbie quickly loosed their robes and shoes and jumped into the pit with two local fellows. Adrial started strong and managed to get a good grip on the squealing piglet, but one of the townsmen tackled him and the pig slipped free. He was scooped up by Barbie, who was in turn tackled by Adrial. Things continued in this line for a while, until finally one of the locals managed to get a grip on the pig and maintain it for the necessary amount of time. While he accepted his victory ribbon, Barbie and Adrial left the pit filthy, winded, and howling with laughter.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the sun began it’s decent to evening, we came across the last game of the day – the Ogre Stomp. There were no ogres in sight, of course. Just a wooden tower with a bell at the top and a steel plate at the bottom. A large hammer rested on the platform. Sirus stepped up, took a mighty swing and hit the plate, but the stone didn’t budge. The crowed groaned and jeered. Barbie stepped up next, casually swung the hammer and caused the bell to ring loudly through the streets. The growing crowd cheered and yelled, and Barbie accepted her prize with a bow and a cocky wave. As the hammer outweighed me by several stone, I decided to sit this one out. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBarbie and Adrial were showing signs of thirst, so we popped into a tavern or three before heading to the church to watch the consecration. I took the opportunity to pick up a tale or two from, among others, the tavern wench, the local stable-boy, and a fellow who I think might have been part troll. Rye was also working the crowd, showing everyone his picture. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was a bit of excitement at the consecration, although it hardly bears mentioning here. In case you hear rumors though, please know that it was a minor incident; the goblins never managed to actually burn anything down, the list of wounded is quite short, and all in our little band escaped basically unscathed. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have retired now to my room, to enjoy some peace and quiet. Tomorrow is a new day, and I can only imagine what it will bring. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith Love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWillow Berrypipe&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vr5yf/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "text": "September 23rd &amp;nbsp;\n\nRusty Dragon Inn, Sandpoint&amp;nbsp;\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nMy dearest Jemma,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health, dearest sister. I have made it safely to Sandpoint and find myself happily settled at the Rusty Dragon Inn. I’ve made some new friends, of course, and I’ve already added several excellent tales to my collection; I’ve included a couple of the shorter tales here for your amusement. I can’t wait to share them with the good folks of Whistledown! The cast of characters here promises much scope for our entertainment. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI came across a rather unique lady – I use the term “lady” loosely – at several taverns today. Barbie, they call her, has come to Sandpoint with the sole purpose of consuming every bit of alcohol in town. I mentioned the upcoming festival but she didn’t seem to know what I was talking about; she slurred something vaguely threatening and passed out at the table. I’m hoping to learn more in the morning. If she can sober up enough to tell it, I’m sure her story will be highly amusing! &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHer companion was slightly more sober, although he didn’t seem any more interested in the festival. Adrial did share some stories of his homeland, Korvosa. He seemed reluctant to go into detail about his family, but we chatted happily about the new church consecration and blessing for a while before Barbie dragged him upstairs for an afternoon “nap”. They might be half-elves, but I have a feeling they’re capable of making a giant ruckus; I’m glad my room is on the opposite end of the inn, well out of earshot. &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nAfter exploring the market, I returned to the Rusty Dragon for dinner and met Sirus. He’s a human, prone to the usual folly and strangeness of his kind, but he’s full of stories and jokes and I find myself completely charmed. His homeland remains mostly a mystery and he seems reluctant to discuss it much – I get the feeling there’s some bad blood there, but I’m sure I’ll be able to ferret out the details eventually.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nFinally, I encountered an elf. We have not been formerly introduced and I know almost nothing about him, but that his name is Rye and he’s quite rude. We collided at the bar as I was paying for my meal. Instead of apologizing, he thrust a picture of a woman in my face and asked if I’d seen her. She was handsome, certainly, but not anyone I’m familiar with. I told him as much and he stomped away to a table in the corner without so much as a nod of acknowledgement. I sense sadness in him, but also a deep power; I wouldn’t want to cross this man. My curiosity is peaked: I’ll be keeping an eye out for the woman, and enclose a rough sketch of her; perhaps she’s familiar to you or someone in the village.&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd now, dear Jemma, it’s time for sleep. Tomorrow is the first day of the festival and it promises to be a busy one, so I’ll rest while I can! &amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWith love,&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWillow Berrypipe &amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5vm35t/pathfinder_rise_of_the_runelords_a_retelling_part/)",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5u362q/silent_legions_the_blizzard_part_2/\n***\nOur actors for this mini-campaign:  \n***Charlie Lockwood***, a young teenage girl who is stuck watching her four younger brothers because her parents are high-ranking execs and are rarely around to deal with them.  \n***Annabelle Boudoir***, a somewhat preppy daddy’s girl who had recently moved from Texas, where her father had owned a lucrative oil contract and made some good money.  \n***Raj Mulligan***, born in India and quickly finding himself in the United States of America after birth, Raj is still a ‘fish out of water’ compared to his other friends.  \n***JD Callahan***, the local ‘tough guy bully’ that really only picks on the younger kids he can threaten, but is generally harmless overall. Lives across from Charlie.\n***\nIt is the evening of February 7th, 1978. Annabelle and Charlie are out in the cold dark night, under the watchful eye of a squad of National Guard troops, and *something* has attacked out of the dim light, flitting among the treetops. The soldier escorting Charlie is panicked, face cut by the unseen monster. Searchlights from the APC are cast into the overhead vegetation, and the man lets loose a few bursts from his M16, spraying a wide arc but hitting nothing. He grabs Charlie and shouts to Annabelle, who is finally realizing that something might be wrong. Leathery wings swoop overhead, dive-bombing the group as everyone throws themselves into the back of the APC, and the hatch is locked tight. Something slams itself against the metal hull, but it cannot break through. Everyone holds on tight as the driver throws the armored vehicle backwards, winging a few cars as they rumble down the hill and away from the unknown aggressor. They roll out towards the girl’s house with the intent of dropping them off, the Sergeant calling in the strange sighting.\n\nMeanwhile, Raj is asleep on the couch covered in the Poptarts that the Lockwood Four were trying to feed the sleeping boy. JD only watches in amusement, but frowns when there’s a knock on the door. Then the wall. He can’t quite trace where the sound is coming from, but follows it down the hall. Suddenly the window of the boy’s bedroom, where he had just sent them to fall asleep. They start screaming for help and he grips the knob. However, he had instructed the boys to lock the door and they managed to do just that. Raj wakes up from the shattering glass and the sound of JD throwing himself against the door to open it. He dusts off the crumbs and tries to get the frazzled JD to tell him what’s going on, but the beleaguered bully just keep slamming the door. Raj is the more intellectual sort and starts rummaging through drawers to find a key, but JD finally manages to smash the door at it’s weakest point, and it flings outwards.\n\nThree of the boys are clinging to the top bunk of their bed, while another is on the ground in the grasp of some strange addled man. It looks to be almost four feet tall, a thick beard covering the mottled looking skin and milky-white eyes. It hisses and spits at JD, currently grabbing at the youngest boy, who is crying and shouting for help. JD runs in and kicks the creature, who rolls under the bed with Lockwood #4 in its clutches. Not giving up so easily, JD grabs #4’s legs and starts tugging, and manages to free him as the mangled fingers claw at his arms. He instructs the kids to flee the room and get downstairs where there’s a small panic room. The creature flings itself into the air, bouncing around like a hummingbird on speed, and Ray tries to throw a lamp at the ‘crack head’ as they believe the thing to be. The lamp smashes against the wall and the drooling retching monster flings itself at the boy, clawing at Raj’s face. Bleeding and blinded he stumbles out of the room, and JD kicks it away as he shuts the door.\n\nJD’s first plan is to light the thing on fire, flames can cleanse anything. But the risk of collateral damage is too great, though he runs to the garage and finds a Jerry can of fuel, an old rag, and a golf club he could use as a torch. Raj is talking him out of it as the APC pulls up outside, bathing the house in the blinding light. Anna and Charlie skip free of the armored vehicle and run for the door, opening it to find everything in disarray. Raj has fallen over on the couch, JD is gathering various chemicals of explosive and flammable nature, and the boys are screaming and crying downstairs. Not too mention the banging on the bedroom door. The two girls try to figure out what the hell is going on as JD runs outside, begging the National Guard to help ‘with the monster’. The soldiers don’t believe him at first but are stopped by the one wounded by the unseen attacker not long ago. He takes his rifle and heads into the house, surveying the chaotic scene. JD shows him the door and enters with him.\n\nThe little wretch is clinging to the bunk bed support, sputtering and hissing. Scared out of his boots at all the weird things happening around him, and seeing the blood already coating the thing’s hands and feet, he opens fire with his rifle, spraying bullets all over the wall. He shouts at JD to shut the door, and the teen does just that. The gremlin flings itself, ripping into the man’s fatigues with razor-sharp claws. Since they were just on an aid mission he’s not wearing any sort of armor, and cries out as the attack digs into his skin. He drops his rifle and falls back against the door, which JD opens. He drags the man outside and dives for the assault rifle just as the thing does as well, both of them starting a tug-of-war. But JD is holding the butt of the rifle, and squeezes the trigger off, sending the thing pitching and falling back, dazed but not hurt. The magazine is empty as well, and JD shuts the door again, dropping the rifle next to the groaning soldier. He decided to go with his original plan. Charlie and Anna hold the door shut as he wraps and tapes the old work rag onto the golf-club, dousing it in gasoline and triggering his lighter.\n\nIt flickers into flames as he approaches the howling monstrosity that lays behind the door. Gripping the club tightly he shoulders open the door. Everything unfolds in an instant. The thing, spittle-flying and claws sharp and coated with slick-crimson, launched into the air. JD took a downward swing, clipping it and sending it into the ground. The teen never hesitated once as he slammed again and again, pummeling the shrieking little monstrosity. It twitched and died, and the fun was ended as the whole house filled the Guardsman, pulling JD away and securing the wounded. The citizen-soldiers filled the halls as they dragged out the gibbering corpse, and the medic attended to Raj and the wounded man as well. The kids were ordered to sit down, and the lengthy and needed process of an incident report was taken, and parents were called and notified. Annabelle’s father Doug was furious that his daughter was out so late and getting involved in ‘illegal troubles’. He headed over and took her home. Raj was taken by the Guardsman to their local med center before being passed into his family’s care. There was scarring but the damage was mostly cosmetic. Like a cat had really let loose into his face. Charlie’s parents couldn’t make it home as quickly, being away on a business trip as usual, and the National Guard stayed camped outside while they shut the area down.\n\n*During the night, plots were set into motion. The cogs in the machines started turning. A small conference room was staffed by suited men, looking at the evidence of the Geneva-level anomaly, with possible civilian contamination. The suits agree that it is time to initiate GALAHAD.*\n\nIt is February 8th, 1978. Upon waking up Annabelle argues with her father again, and sneaks out of the house to visit Charlie. She had theories about why all this strange stuff was happening. They called up Raj and convinced him to come out. Though he put up a protest, his parents believed that hanging out with his friends would be good for the healing process. Charlie left her little brothers in the care of Raj’s mom when they went to meet him. The only one that didn’t join in was JD, who was attending to his only relative, his dementia-ridden grandmother Ellie. He was making her some soup and nursing himself a morning beer when he saw Anna rush over, and something inside of him got mad. He called up Anna’s dad and informed him that she had snuck out. Furious, the ex-oil baron called the Lockwood house and demanded that she came home, but Anna refused and hung up, intent on running away if that’s what it took to solve the case. Charlie, Anna, and Raj all went to collect JD who was hoping to enjoy some fallout, but didn’t want to go back to the construction site. His grandmother convinced him to go play with his friends for a little bit, and the group headed outwards.\n\nThey reached the site and kicked out all the kids who were sledding there. The group huddled around the whole, unsure of who should go first. Anna volunteered and dropped down. It was just like the other time, smooth cobblestone with torches set in holders. Only this time nobody had a light. She started to follow the wall until she came across fluttering in the darkness. Deciding that safety was in numbers, she called down the others. Raj came in next, tapping his hand upwards to experiment, and finding that bird-like creatures were curiously following their exploration. Charlie jumped in and JD stayed behind as a look-out. The three explorers carefully made their way through the darkness until they came to a different chamber, one with carvings in the walls. A large mammal was rooting around, but seemed to give them no trouble as they passed. Each respected each-other’s space. JD finally jumped down as well, worried that they were taking too long.\n\nThe four of them singled in on some flickering light in the tunnel’s horizon. It was a campfire, and three people talked and swapped stories in a language none of them had heard. Anna tripped over a loose stone that had fallen free of the carved wall, and both groups dropped into stances of engagement. A torch was lit by the fireside crew and both sides gasped.\n\nStanding before the four kids were Brunhilda the Magic-User, Frieda the Thief, Traje the Elf. The very same characters they had used in Raj’s D&amp;D campaign...",

        "text": "I'm in a Skype group chat with many good friends that I've made online, and every so often we decide to do something incredibly stupid just for kicks. Over the past few months, a guy called Temp has been running games of Oregon Trail. We start off by picking five members of the group chat to go on the wagon by naming our party members after them; afterwards, all of the decisions one would typically have to make (how much initial gear to buy, routing, speed and rations, etc.) are made by the people on the wagon as a whole, while Temp gives us updates whenever anything significant happens. Typically, we all end up making terrible decisions, such as fording every river (including the extremely deep ones towards the end of the game) and starting the game with only 4 oxen, the maximum quantity of bullets, one set of spare parts, and around 100 food. As a result, even our best game only had two survivors, and none of us expected anything more from the run that took place on Valentine's day this year.\n\n[(I recommend looking at the in-game map of Oregon Trail to really get an idea of what went on in this run.)](https://blog.richmond.edu/livesofmaps/files/2014/10/Oregontrail_map2.gif)\n\nAround 10 at night on Valentine's Day, Temp started up the game as usual, asking for volunteers to brave the trip westward to Oregon. The final cast was myself, Hobbes, Shark, Sock, and Darth, with Aeront commentating from the sidelines. We promptly got off to a terrible start, choosing to be a farmer and to leave in July, the last possible month.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 9:24:05 PM] Aeront: july or no balls 0&lt;0\n\nSince we chose Farmer, we only had $400.00 to spend on oxen, clothing, bullets, food, and spare parts. (For those who haven't played Oregon Trail, it costs $40 for 2 oxen, $0.20 per pound of food, $10 for 1 pair of clothing, $2 for 20 bullets, and $10 for one of the three types of spare parts.) In order to survive, we would have to carefully balance how much we spent on each item. Too few oxen and we'd be in risk of running out of oxen and stalling; too little clothing and we'd become ill more easily due to exposure to the elements; too little food and we'd starve before reaching good hunting grounds; too few bullets and we'd run out of food due to being unable to hunt; too few spare parts and we'd be unable to progress if our wagon broke; and finally, without a decent leftover supply of money we'd be unable to purchase anything at forts, leaving us with no flexibility.\n\nNaturally, we disregarded all of those factors and went for pure meme value.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 9:26:46 PM] Aeront: actual strategy talk here: ox control how fast you mvoe every day. If we're going speed get-there-before-winter strats, we're gonna hella oxen\n\nThanks to this one-off suggestion from Aeront, our group promptly voted to purchase the maximum number of oxen. These 18 oxen cost us $360, leaving us for $40 to spend on all of our other supplies. We then proceeded to buy 10 pounds of food and 760 bullets, leaving us with no money, no clothes, and no spare parts. (The maximum number of bullets we've used in the past has been around 400.) Then, since we'd gone ahead and blown almost all of our money on oxen, we decided to go full meme strats by setting the pace to maximum and the rations to minimum. We all thought that this would be an absolutely terrible run...\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 9:38:12 PM] Hobbes: i legitimately do not know what food is  \n[2/14/2017 9:38:17 PM] Sharkpetter: i'm p sure anyone who survives this trip automatically qualifies for the Rider class  \n[2/14/2017 9:38:22 PM] Hobbes: i have eaten some frozen things and some cereal  \n[2/14/2017 9:38:27 PM] Hobbes: we can live on nothing we're fine  \n[2/14/2017 9:38:40 PM] Sharkpetter: i don't think any of us dingii know how to eat anyway  \n[2/14/2017 9:38:50 PM] Hobbes: *charge*  \n\nThat is, until we traveled *60 miles* on our first day. (For reference, according to www.californiatrailcenter.org, typical wagon trains averaged 10 to 20 miles per day.) Leaving Independence on July 1st, we reached the Kansas River crossing on July 4th. We had in essence traveled roughly 30 miles each day. (Aeront, god that he is, helpfully submitted [some fanart.)](https://i.gyazo.com/ad7df46b8e9546c2d06d58e02231d96c.png) We quickly realized that, rather than abusing a terrible meme strat, we had stumbled upon a meme strat that *actually worked.* We quickly forded the Kansas River (to cries of \"FORD BUILT STRONK\"), reaching and similarly fording the Big Blue River a mere 2 days later. This blistering pace didn't do wonders for our health or our food stores; in a first for the series, Indians took pity on us by helping us find some food, while we were forced to increase rations to medium and begin hunting for more food. Our first kill was a deer; upon realizing that a single deer gave us 61 pounds of food, we temporarily wondered how we had managed to survive so long on so little food before quickly discarding our sense of logic and reason once more.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 9:51:12 PM] Hobbes: a deer is 61  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:15 PM] Hobbes: …we bought *10*  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:25 PM] Tempest: you bought a bag of oreos  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:31 PM] Hobbes: *how are we not dead*  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:31 PM] Tempest: it just a short road trip right  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:43 PM] Jan: That's all the sustenance  \n[2/14/2017 9:51:45 PM] Tempest: MOVING ON\n\nOn July 17th, we reached Fort Laramie, stopping to hunt once more due to the fact that we had already eaten through our supplies. Reaching the South Pass, we had to decide whether we wanted to brave the Green River crossing or take the coward's way out by detouring to Fort Bridger. Naturally, we took the fast road.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:01:27 PM] Hobbes: maybe we should slow down to slightly less speed  \n    [2/14/2017 10:01:35 PM] Aeront: GET OFF THE WAGON HOBBES  \n    [2/14/2017 10:01:59 PM] Sharkpetter: AND IF YOU EVER COME BACK  \n    [2/14/2017 10:02:06 PM] Sharkpetter: WE'LL KILL YOU  \n    [2/14/2017 10:02:18 PM] Hobbes: okay fine we can outrun death  \n\nWe arrived at Green River on August 7th; we had at this point covered approximately half of the United States in four weeks. We learned that the river was 400 feet across and 20 feet deep. We wisely decided that fording would be a Bad Idea; however, since we had no money to pay for a ferry &amp; the local Indian wanted clothes in exchange for his help, we were forced to caulk the wagon and float across. Given our past history of losing possessions due to a caulked wagon overturning, we prepared for the worst...\n\nAnd lost nothing. By some divine intervention, we managed to cram 18 oxen onto a small wagon and float across a 400 foot river with no problems whatsoever. In celebration (and also so that our health would stop being \"very poor\") we raised our rations to maximum and went hunting for a few days. We then continued our breakneck blitz towards the West Coast.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:11:26 PM] Hobbes: why have we not taken over any of these forts and stolen all their shit  \n[2/14/2017 10:11:34 PM] Aeront: THAT WOULD TAKE TIME HOBBES  \n[2/14/2017 10:11:36 PM] Hobbes: we’ve got a small army’s worth of bullets \n\nPassing by Fort Hall, we set course for the Snake River crossing. Hobbes caught measles, and was promptly mocked.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:15:02 PM] Hobbes: huh  \n[2/14/2017 10:15:08 PM] Jan: DAMMIT HOBBES  \n[2/14/2017 10:15:09 PM] Hobbes: guess pestilence rides faster than death  \n[2/14/2017 10:15:20 PM] Hobbes: *but we can outrun that too*  \n[2/14/2017 10:15:27 PM] Shark: well, Death *does* come in last place in the horse race  \n\nHowever, out of the blue, tragedy struck... one of our oxen was injured. After spending a few minutes mourning our temporary setback (and mocking Darth for also catching measles), we continued speeding towards Snake River, determined not to allow our pace to flag in honor of our fallen comrade. We then discovered the bad news: the river was only 6 feet deep, but it was 1004 feet across. Once more, we could not afford a ferry and the Indians were unwilling to trade for anything but clothing. Offering a prayer to our remaining 17 oxen, we prepared to attempt to float across the absurd length of water.\n\nSomehow, we lost nothing. All of our oxen survived, none of our possessions were wet, and no one fell overboard. It was nothing short of a miracle, clearly granted to us by our fallen oxen brother.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:26:16 PM] Temp: **OH**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:17 PM] Temp: **OH**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:18 PM] Temp: **WHERE YOU AT**    \n[2/14/2017 10:26:19 PM] Aeront: **WHAT**    \n[2/14/2017 10:26:22 PM] Temp: **WHERE YOU AT**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:25 PM] Darth: YES  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:26 PM] Shark: **HAPPY FEET**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:28 PM] Hobbes: HOLY OXEN STACK  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:28 PM] Kmj10: **WHAT IS THIS**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:29 PM] Jan: WOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHH  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:35 PM] Kmj10: **THAT AIN'T FALCO**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:37 PM] Sock: OXEN COMBO  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:37 PM] Aeront: **THE GODS FAVOR US**  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:43 PM] Hobbes: …actually “holy oxen stack” sounds like a viable curse  \n[2/14/2017 10:26:46 PM] Hobbes: i’ma start using that   \n\nOnly stopping to hunt, we continued blazing a path through Oregon Trail at strictly irresponsible speeds. Refusing to back down now that we'd come this far, the wagon crew nearly mutinied at the suggestion of moving the pace down to medium. In response to our by all rights impossible feats, nature itself began to conspire against us, sending heavy fog and severe thunderstorms to delay our travels. We didn't care. At this point, we were all either already insane or going there fast.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:32:38 PM] Kmj10: THE HEAVENS CONSPIRE AND PESTILENCE NIPS AT OUR HEELS, *BUT THERE ARE NO BRAKES ON THE WAGON TRAIN*  \n[2/14/2017 10:33:01 PM] Temp: Out of food, shoot animals?  \n[2/14/2017 10:33:04 PM] Aeront: yee  \n[2/14/2017 10:33:07 PM] Shark: Shoot animals  \n[2/14/2017 10:33:15 PM] Sock: shoot to kill  \n[2/14/2017 10:33:18 PM] Hobbes: ~~my gradual descent into an ox-worshipping cultist is the most logical part of this journey~~  \n\nTrue to his word, Hobbes began exclaiming that we should feed a bear to the oxen so that they could gain its strength and dominate nature. He seemed convinced that it was the act of stabbing his own eyes out (not an actual in-game action) that caused us to no longer lose a day the second time that the fog came around. \n\nAt this point in time, we had reached the Blue Mountains. Rather than take the logical route and avoid the Dalles river, we decided to continue our beeline for the West. Hobbes caught a case of dysentery to go with his measles. We blamed vengeful gods of Oregon, attempting to stop our glorious oxen from supplanting them. \n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:40:35 PM] Kmj10: *no one's dying on my wagon train dammit*  \n[2/14/2017 10:40:39 PM] Temp: OK moving on  \n[2/14/2017 10:40:45 PM] Hobbes: *i shall live on in the afterlife*  \n[2/14/2017 10:40:56 PM] Kmj10: *YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO DIE WHEN WE GET THERE AND NOT A MOMENT SOONER*  \n\nHowever, the gods of Oregon were not to be deterred... We were soon forced to mourn the tragic death of one of our oxen. Devastated by our loss, we contemplated attempted to acquire another oxen via trading; however, we determined in the end that no mere mortal ox would be able to maintain the pace of our gods, so we pushed forward regardless.\n\nOur efforts were finally rewarded as we reached the Dalles River, the final obstacle standing between us and sweet, sweet West Coast land. The tension mounted as we left Tempest to control the minigame... completely blindly. He had never seen this minigame before, much less performed it, but none of us wanted to waste our time allowing him to watch a youtube video. \n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:48:05 PM] Temp: *no screw i'm going in blind let's go*  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:10 PM] Aeront: **YES**  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:11 PM] Shark: *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:18 PM] Temp: **LET'S FUCKING GO**  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:18 PM] Hobbes: *we have our own gods, and they lead us onward! those fearsome pioneers of oregon have grown complacent, and the old shall fall before the new!*    \n[2/14/2017 10:48:24 PM] Kmj10: *NO TIME FOR VIDEOS*  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:28 PM] Darth: BRING IT ON GAME GODS  \n[2/14/2017 10:48:35 PM] Aeront: Best lore since Twitch Plays Pokemon\n\nThis decision turned out to be a major error, to say the least. As Tempest attempted to dock the raft, he instead hit the shore, resulting in the tragic loss of three more of our precious oxen gods. Pressing on through the pain, we charged towards Oregon.\n\nWe reached Oregon on September 23rd. We had 5 people in poor health, 1 wagon, 14 oxen, 328 bullets, 5 pounds of food, 0 spare parts, 0 sets of clothing, and no cash. Our initial score was 1,612; thanks to the 3x multiplier from playing as a farmer, our points were tripled, leaving us with a final score of 4836 and [4th place on the Oregon Top Ten.](http://imgur.com/a/2spUv) We had made the journey in slightly less than 3 months.\n\n&gt;[2/14/2017 10:57:50 PM] Aeront: Ran some math, and, including the days we spent sitting around doing nothing because of delays, we went about 24 miles every single day  \n[2/14/2017 11:01:17 PM] Aeront: so clearly the strategy to get across the oregon trail is to buy nothing except OXEN and BULLETS, ride so quickly not even death can catch you, face every river head on, and never surrender to easier trails\n\nWe never set the pace below the maximum pace, we encountered every possible river without taking a ferry or hiring an Indian, we never traded or bought supplies at a store, and we never stopped to rest. Our wagon never broke. The run took around an hour and a half, lasting until 11:15 at night. It was the first time that every member of the wagon train had survived the entire journey.\n\nIn short, it was a glorious ride.\n\nTL,DR: We covered the entirety of the Oregon Trail in slightly less than 3 months with no deaths, no clothes, no spare parts, 10 pounds of food, 760 bullets, and 18 oxen.\n\nP.S.

        "text": "[A long, long, time ago, in a galaxy that really wasn't all THAT far off if you just followed the left wall of the quantum tunnel, there was a campaign about a bunch of fuckwits running around on a tiny planet generally fucking or un-fucking things through a combination of rampant violence and dipl- well, no, mostly just rampant violence.](https://redd.it/554gjl)\n\nThree individuals who can only loosely be described as 'heroes' were investigating some odd bits of the comet. [Richard the necromancer](http://imgur.com/sZuNYz5), also known as the socially inept nerd with the smartass Psychopomp familiar, had been doing some digging into the lore of the setting, attempting to find a repository of knowledge rumored to be hidden somewhere on the comet, and filled with more knowledge than you could possibly imagine. [Cinder, the changeling oracle](http://imgur.com/Emday0T), saw this investigating as an opportunity for personal gain and possibly the opportunity to zap someone in the genitals with a bolt of fire. And finally [Jello Shot](http://imgur.com/IiL7PFg), well... Jello Shot liked going interesting places. They usually contained things to eat, like people, and books.\n\nThis investigation ran them into another person seeking knowledge- an elvish assassin by the name of Rhangyl, decked out in tight-fitting gear and a breath mask to keep him from breathing the toxic air of the comet. Rhangyl was from Faery, and was assigned to the task of finding a vast repository of knowledge known as **The Library**. This was not particularly helpful, as just about everyone knew about **The Library**, they just assumed you meant the local one, with the nice selection of fiction and old magazines. And as Rhangyl investigated, he crossed paths with the party. And while normally this ended in one or more people being turned into a charred cloud of meat-vapor, the two groups decided to pool their efforts to find the elusive **The Library**.\n\nTheir investigations eventually led them to a secret portal guarded by the Psychopomps- creatures that claimed authority over the souls of the dead- and apparently, they were not having a wonderful time. Something had gone wrong, it seemed, and the psychopomp guards were frantic about some sort of event or break-in that had completely mussed up damn near everything. As Rhangyl was forming a nefarious plan to sneak past the guards, Cinder made a fatal mistake. She spoke a series of words that should never, ever be uttered.\n\n\"Everything got screwed up? Like with that unlucky bird-guy you met a while ago? Good thing he's not here!\"\n\nRapidly approaching footsteps and a rising scream sounded in the distance, and the entire party fixed Cinder with a hard, accusing gaze. Cinder wisely decided to shut her mouth as Emil the unlucky Syrinx, the man with the worst luck in the entire world, charged headlong into them, tripped over every single one of them with his raggedy robes getting caught in their gear, and flopped them all right onto the portal as the stunned Psychopomps looked on. There was a rushing sensation, and the party arrived at **THE LIBRARY**, in all its resplendant glory. Whereupon one of the librarians regretfully informed them that they were closed for repairs, and please come back some other time.\n\nJello Shot threw Emil at the librarian and the entire party zipped inside before anyone could stop them. Once in the premesis, Cinder calmly informed the desk clerk that they were 'VIP Guests' here to help out with the troubles that the library had been going through. Due to an ungodly bluff roll, she got away with it, and the party scattered to do some reading.\n\nOver the course of their investigation, they turned up several things. 1: Lots of juicy info about everything Rhangyl wanted to know. 2: Lots of juicy info about everything Rhangyl *really would rather not* know. 3: An incredible number of the books were missing or just ended partway through. 4: The God of Knowledge ran this place. 5: Ran. Past tense. Said god had abandoned the library. 6: The library needed a new source of magic energy to restore all the books that had been so cruelly been bisected and neglected by their patron god. And finally, 7: There was a weird locked door on one of the upper floors.\n\nAfter making a great many checkouts, Richard hunkered down to examine his various findings more closely- he being actually interested in the various bits of information he could find. Cinder and Jello Shot, being vastly bored by Richard's stern instructions to not eat or set fire to anything, decided to take a crack at the ornate door on the upper floors. A bit of deciphering by Cinder, and she discovered the meaning of the inscription carved into the big, heavy door that so rudely blocked their way. \"*ONLY THOSE WITH THE GIFT MAY ENTER*.\"\n\nCinder pointed out that over the course of their various adventures, the party had met up with quite a number of people with incredible magical signatures that may or may not be the 'gift' the inscription talked about. She also helpfully mentioned that, hey, wasn't Emil one of those guys with incredible magical signatures? Jello Shot had to restrain himself from murdering Cinder as Emil, somehow called by the mention of his name, emerged into the library and immediately started fucking up damn near everything. Richard was not pleased to have his reading interrupted, and attempted to chase the wayward Emil down before he could completely compromise this bastion of knowledge.\n\nJello Shot, meanwhile, decided that door inscriptions were for pansies, discarded all of his possessions, and began to squeeze under the tiny crack of the door at an agonizingly slow pace.\n\nWhen he finally emerged into the space behind the door, he found himself in a completely black, featureless void. [After a tense moment, two gleaming eyes sprang out of the shadows, counterpointed by a wide, predatory mouth set in a sinister grin.](http://i.imgur.com/Lc70Yi1.png)\n\nJello Shot immediately regretted this decision.\n\nA merry, echoing voice congratulated Jello Shot for his tenacity. And suddenly in the void, far above, there was a grand, gilded book, descending slowly. The voice purred: \"I hadn't been planning on giving this to anyone... *But you've earned it, you little cheater*.\" Jello Shot began to panic, frantically searching for the exit, and in desperation, tried to destroy the book with his magic spells. This only seemed to amuse the mysterious entity in the room with Jello Shot, and it doubled down on getting Jello Shot to absorb the book, turning individual pages into paper airplanes and hurling them like darts. Jello Shot erected barriers of force and shot the planes out of the air, and the voice began to laugh in genuine delight, eyes and mouth shrinking and shrinking until-\n\nJello Shot was forcibly expelled out the door in a blast of magic, bowling over Cinder and throwing them both off a high balcony and directly into Richard's pile of interesting reads (He was not pleased). An in the wake of the landing, a small object floated through the air... a bit of jet-black paper, with two gleaming green eyes and a wicked grin etched onto it. As it fluttered down randomly through the air, the party watched in abject horror as Rhangyl decided to snatch it and see what it was, only for it to affix to his hand and start to stretch over his arms, torso, and face. That couldn't be good. And then, after a bit of screaming, some ominous cracking, and maybe a few cheesy special effects, Rhangyl looked up to the party and *grinned*.\n\nWhat followed could best be described like this: Imagine [Jim Carrey's The Mask](http://i.imgur.com/8BShvnO.jpg) if he was crossed with The Joker and kept trying to 'lighten the mood' by pulling 'harmless' pranks, such as releasing chaotic bursts of energy and making people's pants fly off. The course of action was clear: The party had to get whatever the hell it was OFF of Rhangyl before everything went COMPLETELY to shit. You know, aside from the damage already done, the books that had been tossed around and torn, the unauthorized entry into one of the most secure and sacred places on the comet, and the accidental introduction of *THE UNLUCKIEST MAN IN THE WORLD* to said secure and sacred place. The point is that they were *trying* to fix it, okay?\n\nBut Rhangyl wasn't having it, keeping one step ahead of his pursuers and nailing them with chaotic magic bursts whenever they got too close. But the party wasn't having it, and with a massive effort, they managed to bodily tackle the crazed nutcase right as he popped open a personal portal to his 'master', the tremendously dickish elf noble who had wanted Rhangyl to find and *conquer* the library so that it could be used for political assassination reasons. And as Rhangyl slipped out of the party's grip, he 'reported in' to his dull, completely unamusing boss with a long-winded report full of jokes and capers and visual gags. When said boss did not like this new attitude from his most straight-laced personal assassin, Rhangyl pants'd him, offered him a hand up that contained an electrified joy buzzer, and hit his dickish boss with a random magical effect that capped the boss's HP based on his WIS.\n\nSuffice it to say that the dickish boss nearly died on the spot and ordered 'this terrible creature and all of his accomplices' to be executed for tresspassing on sacred elvish grounds, assault, and insubordination. The party was not thrilled. However, they had been in the general area before (a series of flying ships), knew a few escape routes, so they focibly grabbed the astonished Rhangyl, pried the terrible paper mask-thing off his face, and made a hasty aerial getaway using flight spells and Jello Shot's complete immunity to falling damage. Once they had finally gotten out of the airship flotilla and back to solid ground, they now had to decide their next step, because they still had the paper mask-thing that made people act like complete fuckwits.\n\nBut what to do with the damn thing? It was powerful as hell, intelligent, nearly indestructible, and fought violently against being contained. Oh, and anyone who wore it become like the aforementioned fuckwit. They even tried firing it out of Jello Shot's cannon and off the comet, only for it to fold itself into a paper airplane, do a wide U-turn, and nail Jello Shot directly in his slimy bitch face. Whereupon the mask began to spread over his wobbly form and-\n\nShrink him down to an absolutely comically small size, without affecting his personality much at all.\n\nBecause you see, the room in the library had been created by the God of Chaos, who hated playing by the rules and doing what people expected. Within that room was a book of critical knowledge of the days to come, which said Chaos God had planned to show to one of the 'gifted' people with the incredible auras, and then destroy it before their eyes. *To build character*, you understand. But then Jello Shot had bypassed the requirements, and the Chaos God decided to hand over the knowledge, because Chaos always respects a good cheater. But Jello Shot surprised the chaos god again by RESISTING the critical knowledge, and this amused the God so much that he decided to leave a special gift for Jello Shot. A fraction of himself, forged into a paper mask, that would bring Jello Shot's erratic and highly amusing will into the world- or failing that, encourage a healthy amount of fuckery in anyone else who dared to wear it. Jello Shot himself was immune to the mind-warping effects- the mask, after all, was made for him.\n\nThe party watched in dawning horror as Jello Shot began to test and abuse his newfound powers, bouncing around like a hyperkinetic ball of snot, pantsing people, and seeing what the chaotic energy of the mask allowed him to do. And they realized, Jello Shot was never going to let go of that damned thing... But considering the circumstances, it was hard to imagine him getting up to any shenanigans that would prove WORSE than the troubles they already caused.\n\nRight?\n\nTUNE IN NEXT TIME FOR A SERIOUS PLOT TWIST! OH SNAP!",

Some minor DA:I spoilers, particularly involving the Solas romance. Mild NSFW in some of the links.\n\nOn my canon playthrough of Dragon Age Inquisition, I played a female elf reaver who romanced Solas. Which is to say that I played a tiny twig girl, who was a wild berserker who drank dragon blood and threw around a greatsword that was the same size as her body. Fun stuff. She was loud and aggressive, and became fast friends with Sera and Blackwall, who, along with Solas, became my main party members. They have pretty great banter (Sera and Blackwall are [best friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m_QvSC1Kwc), Blackwall and Solas have both [philosophical discussions and like messing with each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwEF1pjroKc), and Sera and Solas [hate each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAL6nhEN0g). Also, for some reason, they have a lot of conversations about food) so I always enjoyed bringing that team out into the field.\n\nOf course, if you've played through the Solas romance or know anything about it, you know that you get dumped near the end of the game. I won't spoil exactly *why* that happens, but my character decided the best way to blow off some steam would be to go dragon hunting in Emprise Du Lion. The last two dragons in Emprise Du Lion are actually a bit harder than the final boss, or at least I thought so, anyway, and the last one took a few good tries. I wound up still bringing Solas with me though, because he was my best-specced mage, though I liked to think that they could try to be on friendly terms after the breakup. And of course, Sera and Blackwall, trying their best to be the supportive friends she needed. (and inevitably failing)\n\nNow if you've played DA:I you'll know that every 12-17 minutes on a level, there's a chance for Party Banter to happen, where two members of the party will have a conversation. So I finish killing the dragon, and I'm super excited, and that's obviously taken at least 15 minutes because suddenly I hear Sera say:\n\n[\"So, you and the lady Inquisitor. Interesting!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PkazhoggmQ)\n\n\"Your interest is not my concern.\"\n\n\"That's alright, because I meant BORING. The elf always takes the elf so the bumping bits will *mean* something.\"\n\nSera we JUST KILLED A DRAGON. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO HARASS MY EX-BOYFRIEND ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.",

        "text": "Just a little bit of context before I start, this story is about the first time I ran a specific game, which I've since re-run for other players. It was the very first game I ever DM'd, and I did it way back during high school so it was more than a little shitty. But despite how bad I was at DMing due to inexperience, it still generated some amazingly funny and memorable moments. The system, Big Eyes Small Mouth is more designed as a catch-all anime tabletop game to fit multiple genres, and my players had suggested I use it since D&amp;D didn't fit the homebrew Legend of Zelda setting I had in mind. So with a horribly broken and easily exploited system and zero experience DMing, I set off to create an amazing experience for my high school bros!\n\nImmediately our party composition became interesting. We had Pike Waddles, the Goron fighter who spent most of his character points maxing his Body stat to make himself ridiculously powerful at the expense of being dumb as a rock. Which he technically sorta was, being a Goron and all. Next was Zuri Meena, the comparatively sane and stable Zora mage who specialized in water magic and was cripplingly weak to fire. (The logic behind that being it would dry her out, and Zoras couldn't handle dehydration.) Next was Jake the Hylian \"Gambling Mage\" who used animated playing cards for his attacks and was a bit of a secretly evil douchebag. Then we had Zach the Kokiri archer, who somehow could leave the Kokiri Forest due to a hidden backstory element that we never got around to exploring. Zach also was a NASTY minmaxer who figured out how to break BESM's called shot system to crit on every single attack. He was also cripplingly weak to fire since he was aligned to the Forest element. Next we have Chandra the somewhat criminally insane Gerudo thief who has a really fucking big scimitar and not enough sense to avoid swinging it around wildly. Finally we had G, the Deku Scrub who really didn't have much of any special skills and was just a crazy religious cultist looking for evidence of his lost eldritch god of war. Also, since he's literally a walking shrub, he too has a weakness to fire. If you're seeing a pattern here regarding their collective weaknesses, good, then you're already smarter than the players at the time!\n\nOk, time to adventure! Basic plot hook is that the party are a part of the Hylian national guard, being put on duty at home while most other guard have been drafted into a war with a neighboring kingdom. Their first assignment? Deal with a local cave that's been spawning monsters that are raiding a nearby trade route. I, being the fan of insanely complex dungeon maps, had spent copious hours drawing this cave and filling it with mobs, traps, loot, and other nasty hazards. And of course, the one thing I had overlooked was the name of the place, which the party IMMEDIATELY ASKED. Me being the inexperienced high schooler DM that I was, I felt taken off guard and put on the spot and just spat out the first stupid thing that came to mind: \"The Monster Hole.\" This being a group of high schoolers, the table instantly erupted in raucous laughter at my expense. Jake chimes out \"But Daaad, I don't wanna go in the Monster Hole!\" Yup, we're oh so mature. But thankfully I have the patience and the knowledge that the DM always has the last laugh.\n\nThe party delves the dungeon and does well for the first few encounters, though they do forget Zelda lore at one point and Chandra uses a fire spell against some bats, which deals some damage but immediately upgrades them to those annoying fire bats. Which promptly start dealing fire damage to the party's fire-weak members. G gets a fair few of his leaves singed off, but they at least manage to survive. Then they come up to their first serious non-combat obstacle: A rickety bridge over a rushing underground river!\n\nThis doesn't prove to be an issue to most party members. Well, except for poor old Pike Waddles, who is a giant living boulder and weighs like three thousand fucking pounds. If you remember your Zelda lore too, you know Gorons don't swim, they plunge right to the bottom like the igneous lumps they are, and there's no way in Din's fiery hell Pike was going to make it over that bridge alive. Thankfully, BESM has an interesting mechanic called \"Dynamic Sorcery\", where a mage who takes ranks in it can create their own spells on the fly, with DM permission of course. I liked it because it encouraged a lot of creative magical solutions from the casters, and Jake uses this freedom to whip out a good old fashioned \"Conjure Sweet Ramp\" spell and calls out to Pike to curl up and ramp over that motherfucker. Pike then proceeds to roll a critical fail. Pike then proceeds to do a goddamn cannonball into the river and hits the bottom near terminal velocity.\n\nPike's player sighs and goes \"I'll roll up a new character.\" I then interrupt him and tell him it's fine! You remember what happens in a Zelda game when you fall in a pit right? You just reappear at the entrance of the room while taking some damage. I deduct 10HP off Pike and he just appears at the front door. In character, the party turns and gawks at him, Zuri goes \"What the hell just happened?!\" Pike simply replies \"Don't question the laws of the universe!\" and then rolls up and shoots across that ramp in style, landing and pulling a SICK pose at the end. \n\nFinally, the party reaches what I had decided would be the boss of the dungeon, a trio of oversized Dodongos. Those of you who know your Zelda games know that this is going to immediately be a problem for them, because Dodongos breath fire. Which several members of the party are cripplingly weak to. This is where the dice decide to give me the delicious revenge for their laughter at my foolish name mistake. Dodongos immediately roll initiative higher than the party, and round 1, the first one rolls a crit against Zuri. In BESM, you don't need to confirm your crits, they automatically succeed, and you roll a d6 to determine if you deal double, triple, or even QUADRUPLE damage. Guess what the dodongo rolls against Zuri? Yup. Quad damage. Which is then doubled again by Zuri's fire weakness. Needless to say, roast seafood was on the menu that night.\n\nNext Dodongo's turn. It targets G the shrub. It ALSO rolls a crit. IT ALSO ROLLS QUAD DAMAGE. Poor G is brought down to twice his HP in the negative, there's barely even any goddamn ashes left of him.\n\nThird Dodongo's turn, it targets Zach. I roll ANOTHER FUCKING CRIT. At this point the entire table just goes into an uproar of laughter at the cartoonish levels of misfortune they are experiencing. I roll the d6 to determine the crit multiplier out in the open so the party can see I'm not fudging my rolls. GUESS WHAT, QUAD DAMAGE YOU CHEEKY KOKIRI SHIT. The party all get up and pantomime a table flip while laughing their collective asses off. And then Pike, who is immune to fire damage and can punch harder than the impact of the moon hitting Termina, proceeds to fucking solo all three Dodongos without taking a point of damage, and we decide that the survivors are going to go back to buy some goddamn bottled fairies for resurrection like they should have done in the first place. Everyone's thankfully brought back from the dead, albeit poor G returns with a cripplingly massive phobia of fire afterwards.\n\nThat's the tale of how I humiliated myself and nearly TPK'd my party on my very first session! There's more from these guys I might share in the future too if you all enjoyed this story, just let me know if you want more. Things only proceed to get more silly from here on out. ",

        "text": "Setting: A cave buried underground, hidden deep below the ruins of an ancient building, itself hiding in the ambrosial jungles of Qud. The word 'cave' does not suffice - this place was more like a fortress - as it was home to the Barathrumites, an ursine race of tinkers and crafters. A technological wall of force served as their gate, separating those with permission to enter from those without.\n\nEnter me. Having already gained the trust of the Barathrumites, this story begins at the close of another; I am wrapping up a conversation with one of their leaders, as I've just finished a less interesting quest. My character is an Esper, one who specializes in feats of mental prowess. Of particular note is my superb proficiency at clairvoyance, as it grants me sight nigh on omniscience. Through sheer coincidence I happened to be casting my vision abroad as I walked away from the forebear, and thus was not caught flat-footed when the Barathrumites came under attack.\n\nA faction of tech-worshipping knights had appeared, keen on destroying this enclave of research that they deemed heretical. A large EMP pulse shocked the compound, disabling both the force field and the Barathrumite's mechanical guards. I recognized the templar immediately - they were incredibly formidable opponents, and I had always steered clear of them on the surface world. I wouldn't have been too worried if it had only been one or two, but here were nine of them, each carrying weapons and armor more valuable than the sum of my inventory.\n\n----------\n\nAlthough they made the first move by kicking down the door, in a certain sense I had taken the zeroth action by watching them do it. It was a bittersweet fact that the mutations haphazardly bestowed upon me had created a utility monster. So, in response to their declaration of hostile intent, I replaced the absent electronic barrier with my own mental wall, quickly sealing them off once more despite being several rooms away. Another fraction of a second and I had teleported there, facing them down from the safe side where I could begin my work in earnest.\n\nAlthough I had an enormous array of utility, Qud had only granted me two offensive abilities, one of which was useless in this situation. My command over light wouldn't hurt them, as the force field scattered my lasers harmlessly. Unfortunately for them, however, my other specialty was pyrokinesis, and with it I would raze them to ash.\n\nI immediately began summoning gouts of flame on top of them, repeatedly sweeping the area with invisible waves of intense heat. I was a strong enough esper that I could maintain the mental wall indefinitely, only pausing briefly now and then to refresh it, although it helped that they had no ranged firepower of their own. Still, they were incredibly durable and the temperature began rising astronomically as I stacked blaze upon blaze. It reached such incredible levels that the nearby cave walls of shalestone actually began to dissolve into pools of lava.\n\nOne of the Barathrumites closest to the entrance ran up to my wall, intent on fighting back, but instead spontaneously combusted as my mental field did nothing to stop the blistering heat from pouring through. Funny as it was, I was forced to dump a portion of my own fresh water supply on him to keep him from crisping himself. I would have teleported him away, but without control of his destination I was too afraid he would end up inside my inchoate star.\n\n---------\n\nAfter a surprisingly long amount of time, the templar finally began to capitulate, disintegrating inside their own unmarred shells of carbide armor. After the last one had been incinerated, I finally let my  barrier lapse into non-existence. I was proud of myself - I had gotten through what I presumed was supposed to be a difficult encounter without so much as a scratch. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this would prove to be false.\n\nI should have taken a hint from the multiple pools of lava now ringing the ruined entrance. I took one step towards my shiny loot and instantly burst into flames. Running away, I doused myself in more of that precious fresh water, before grumbling about my own stupidity. An entire in-game day had to pass before the area was cool enough for me to  scavenge, let alone leave the settlement. The Barathrumites rewarded me laudably for my defense of their home, especially so since not a single one of them had perished in the process.\n\nThat's been my finest moment so far, although Yelhristivia (my character) no longer roams the viridian surface, having perished to a pair of chaingun turrets. I would never have guessed that something as cool as this story was possible, so who knows if something even more incredible will happen in my future runs, haha! All of this took place in the roguelike 'Caves of Qud', an amazing amalgamation of fantasy, post-apocalypse, and sci-fi elements.",

        "text": "What I'm about to recall happened during a cooperative playthrough (With my long time gaming buddy, Andrew) of Resident Evil 6 on the hardest difficulty, \"No Hope Left\". Enemies hit harder and get hit less, Ammunition barely drops from enemies and in fixed locations is found in less numbers than other difficulties. This was our second play through of the game (After a \"Regular difficulty play through)\n\nWe're in the second chapter of Leon's campaign, making progress on a cathedral to progress the story. At this point, me and Andrew get seperated, we have fairly decent amounts of ammunition as we've been relying on Melee attacks to preserve what ammunition we can.\n\nWe continue through our seperate paths, shooting each zombie in the head once to either kill them outright or stagger them in position for a killing melee blow. There are roughly five on each side. Sometimes we fail to shoot the enemy and one of us dies. Sometimes one of these zombies throws a medieval axe at one of us and we die. But like any hard difficulty we stick at it, and it takes us roughly 20 minutes to hook up at the next area causing a checkpoint.\n\nWe're now at the front door of the cathedral, we know we're going to have to hold out for a around five consecutive minutes against tough enemies to be let into the church. We have around 30 rounds of pistol ammunition and 10 Shotgun Rounds each. We know we're going to have to incapacitate with headshots and go for the melee to try and stay alive.\n\nEnemies start jumping over the fences surrounding us on 3 sides, with the other being the door to the cathedral. We try various methods of getting through this. Running in circles together. Running in opposite circles alone. Standing and fighting. Laying down and fighting. Either way, we come to the conclusion that we are going to have to expend more ammunition than we are currently doing.\nWe fight for an hour, before we manage to hold out for the minimum amount of time to get the door open. Barely. The game transitioned to a cutscene to show us the door was open. When it transitioned back to gameplay, I was being leaped at by an enemy. I instinctively dived backwards with my shotgun pointing at the creature. Andrew had also instinctively shot at the creature with his pistol as it flew past him to me, it dazed the creature and caused it to kneel by my feet, exposing it's weak spot in it's chest. I unloaded the shell, got back on my feet and we ran to the doors.\n\nYou might feel this is long winded. But that's not the main point of this story, that was a prelude of things to come. A chance for you to see how we'd struggled to get to the point about to come.\n\nWe progress through the church, bypassing traps and killing one or two enemies and solving a few puzzles to open a secret passageway. A fairly trivial part of the game. We get a few more boxes of ammo for each weapon, some grenades, and a sniper rifle with 20 or so rounds.\n\nWe have a boss fight coming up. It's a juggernaut style enemy that just keeps soaking up damage until it's threshold is reached. There are 3-6 of the 'easy' zombies to deal with at the start of the battle. Melee is out of the question as it kills via gas at close range.\n\nWe immediately dispatch of the zombies leaving just the boss and proceed to circle round the arena taking shots and throwing grenades. There's 2 or 3 stages to this battle, bit all revolving around just dealing damage. We climb up and down ladders in an effort to stay on a different floor than it, Andrew runs out of most of his ammunition and checks the siderooms for more ammo and finds a handful. We swap, I look for some ammo in the same place (Client side loot). We drop to the bottom floor. About 20 yards between us and the creature. 20 rounds of various caliber ready to rock and no way of escaping if it comes close. A suicidal move, but, bearing next to no ammo and no melee capability, it was either now or nothing. We take aim and fire, side by side. Starting with the rifles. Andrew runs out of rifle ammo before me and switches to his shotgun and gets close to maximise damage, he comes back with his pistol equipped. 10 or so rounds remaining. I use the last of my rifle rounds and switch to my pistol, I have no shotgun shells remaining. I fire all of my pistol rounds, around 5. I stand there, simply stunned that I have no ammunition. I exclaim that I'm out of everything. Andrew meticulously fires all of his remaining rounds, ensuring they all hit their target. His firearm clicks. The creature is 10 yards away, still stumbling slowly towards us. Our backs are against the doors that we fought so hard to get in. The doors we wish we could just open up and give us one more box of rounds, just anything for a chance to make it.\n\nThen like out of a movie, I ask him \"What you got?\"\nHe looks quickly through his inventory.\n\"A Frag\"\n\"Throw it\".\n\nHe drops the grenade by the creatures feet, we both dive to each of our sides, trying to minimise the damage from the explosion. It explodes.\n\nWe sit there, together, 90 miles apart in the real world, in a state of disbelief. The cutscene of the enemy dying has started. We had done it. We both cheered down the mics, Andrew reportedly getting glared at by his partner. And we proceed through the hell that is that difficulty.\n\nTo this day, that is our most memorable moment in gaming. Not the time that we rescued our fathers in the capital wasteland. Nor the time that we first stepped on the Normandy as Commander Shepherd. It's the time that we brothers in arms fought tooth and nail. Twice. And survived by the skin of our bones. Twice. None of this is exaggerated, I've added more detail than is needed for those that haven't played the game to understand the perils and our actions. And the best bit? Resident Evil 6 provided 4 more moments like this, that we can instantly remember. \n\nIf we struggle against the odds in games today we just tell ourselves...\n\n\"Remember the Tall Oaks Cathedral\"",

        "text": "My name is Ventus Stormborn.  \n\nI was born in the small village of Cliffside to Tommyn and Orrilai, a solider turned fisherman and his wife, a net weaver. \n\nI was born different, touched they say, on the first of the month of Tarsakh. The Claw of Storms it is called.  My mother said that I was touched by Akadi, but that was only after her panic subsided for I was born with light blue skin. They thought I had been stillborn until I uttered my first wail.  Orrilai insisted that I was blessing, regardless of what the village elders might say. I mostly remember her for that, and for her kind words to me after yet another round of “beat the blue” by the other children. \n\nIt wasn’t long after that my father decided I had to learn to be a warrior.  He had been in the war of course, but had left for reasons I was too young to understand. He promised to tell me when I was old enough, but that never happened.  Every day Tommyn drilled me in the ways of war. Weapon care, proper discipline, heraldry, and even troop movements. I did not understand then, nor even now, why he felt such things would be important. I figured I would be a fisherman, like my father.  I understood the practicality of learning to fight, being beaten daily has a way of doing that, but the rest was only so much useless trivia to me. It still mostly is, truth be told.  \n\nEverything changed one night when I was 13 winters old.  I awoke to the smell of smoke, the sound of screams, and the feel of my mother shaking me awake.  She dragged me from our little shack of a house into the cold, smoky night while father dug his sword from beneath their bed. He looked so brave there in the light of the flames and moon, standing defiantly as the raiders descended upon us.  Brave, but ultimately foolish. He was cut down nearly instantly. They took longer with mother…\n\nI don’t remember much of the rest of that evening or the next day.  I was taken as a slave by the crew of that ship, the Desire, and thrown into the galley to row with the rest.  However, rather than selling me at their next port the captain decided that I was his “good luck charm” and kept me. Years I spent there rowing and rowing. Growing strong, but having no idea how to use that strength. \n\nI lost track of time, looking back I know that it was 5 years, but then it was impossible to know. All was rowing, or sleeping. Days blurred together. “Did you try to escape?”, you ask? Of course I tried, we all tried. They laughed at us. We wielded our oars like weapons, and tasted the lash until we could no longer see. \n\nA lifetime later, on a clear blue day off the coast near Candlekeep in the Sea of Swords my life changed again.  A storm came. It grew out of the ocean like a boiling pot. It crashed down upon us in a hail of lightning and a roar of thunder.  And in the midst of it I heard a voice. It was as clear to me as yours is. \n\n**“Ventus,” it said, “Ventus, you were born to be more than you are. You are Mine, you are StormBorn. You Will be more than this. I insist.”**\n\nI felt power flow through me then, I raised my hands to the sky and the largest bolt of lightning I have ever seen struck the Desire.  Raiders and slaves alike were flung like shrapnel as the ship exploded beneath my feet. I managed to hang on to consciousness as I sank beneath the waves, down and down watching the remains of the hated ship burn above me.  I swam for shore, my Genasi nature keeping me from drowning, and pulled myself onto the rock-strewn beach.  \n\nBlessings to Akadi, I found several trunks washed ashore as well. I traded my slave rags for armor, and found enough coin to buy a sword.  I am Ventus, I take the name Stormborn as is my birthright. I was once a son, once a boy, once a fisherman and once a slave. No more.  I will carve my own destiny upon the Sword Coast. No man will ever keep me in chains again, nor any other should my will be made so.  \n\nMy name is Ventus Stormborn, remember it. \n\n",

Lives across from Charlie.\n***\nIt is February 7th, 1978. The cold air still chokes the region, and the quiet of the fresh snowfall from the night before dominates all. The gang is hot on the trail of Luna the K9 dog, sent by the Abington police force to sniff out the trail of Jimmy Harrison, a missing child they had seen just yesterday. As the group pounds through the snow with a small band of volunteers and a police officer, they each wonder what they might find. Charlie hopes for the best, but JD is steeling himself for the worst. The K9 seems to be on the right path, but a stiff wind kicks up. The light fluffy snow on the surface whips through the air, a veritable veil of ice that cuts everyone off from each-other. They stumble across the forest floor, and JD trips over something lying in a clearing. Brushing some snow away, he’s startled to find a blue gecko, cold and abandoned. The thing is the size of a large dog, and it shifts ever so slightly. He shouts out and Raj picks through the haze to find him, seeing the corpse as well. The two girls, Charlie and Anna, find Luna the K9, waiting in a clearing for her handler. She has apparently lost the scent. JD prods at the corpse, and a swarm of rats burst free, splitting the body and causing the two teens to fall back in horror. The horde of rats envelope the area, and the girls follow to the source.\n\nThey check the lizard body again, JD braving the unknown to fish around inside. He is relieved to find that this strange lizard did not eat Jimmy. Charlie pokes around the clearing and finds two more gecko bodies in similar fashion, though not full of rats. They call for the officer, who thinks they’re putting on some hoax, and is not pleased. Anna, still as sassy as ever, leaves the officer to fetch Luna and has everyone follow the path left behind my small feet. It has to be Jimmy, and he must’ve been involved with these lizards somehow, whatever and however they arrived. The trail leads to a berm, and there’s a body at the bottom. JD slides down and finds Jimmy, and he appears to be dead. He starts calling for help and Anna fetches the officer, who relieves the group by saying Jimmy is alive, but barely. JD and the officer carefully carry him back up the slope and a medflight helicopter is called in, since the roads are lost to the snow. Jimmy’s parents are relieved their son is found, and attend to him in the helicopter. The police start cordoning off the area, and the gang decides what they want to do next. To distract them from their possibly dead friend, Charlie has Raj leads the four little ones on a fake monster hunt into the woods as she, Anna, and JD check back on the strange lizards. Anna knows a thing or two about hunting from what her father taught her, and she traces their confusing path back to the road. It seems like they were lost, wandering without any rhyme or reason. From the road they realize their close to their neighborhood, the construction site not too far away with its gleaming metal beams jutting into the air.\n\nThey wonder if the hole has anything to do with the lizards, and move to investigate. Breaking back in, JD is the first to fall into the hole. He finds the ground to be smooth cobblestone, and there is what appears to be unlit torches adorning the wall. He takes his lighter and lights one, using it to cast the cold dark passage in warm light. The girls decide they’d be better off with flashlights, and take a half hour to return. While inside JD hears something approaching, and a small man walks into the light. Bearded with deep brown hair and a keen glare, the man questions him in a language totally unfamiliar to the teen. It would appear this man is a gnome, or some sort of dwarf. JD tries his best to be friendly, and eventually the gnome gets the message. The girls arrive and enter the hole as well, and try to make sense of the strange sight. A careful conversation is struck with the little man, as Raj and the kids finally catch up with the group. The gnome gets across that his name is Gemmen, and he lives underground with his people. The humans are ‘Above-Grounders’ and oppress him and the other folk that are forced into the dungeons and tunnels. The kids profess no idea what he’s talking about, and he says he’ll take them to his leader. As the kids pass a stone arch threshold they find themselves finishing up their D&amp;D game in the Lockwood house. All are confused. Was that some vivid dream? Everyone can remember the gnome, but it’s a strange distant feeling that it really happened, a whispy memory.\nWith JD and Raj watching the kids, Anna and Charlie head back to the construction site. The hole appears to be a drainage ditch of some sort, attached to the buildings foundation. Anna jumps inside to check and hurts her ankle. Charlie wonders aloud if Anna will disappear, like Jimmy. The two decide to experiment, with Anna trying to walk the way Jimmy did. Charlie follows carefully, but Anna is almost run down by a National Guard APC. The troops inside implore the girls to leave, then offer to escort them home since Anna seems a bit loopy. The girls want to finish their experiment and start running along, with a few troops following behind.\n\nAs the group reaches the block of the Harrison house, something flits about in the trees. Charlie is the only one that senses something wrong, but a black form swoops low and cuts a shallow wound into a soldier’s face. The men are panicked now, weapons trained on the tree tops as Anna turns around to see what her friend Charlie is so worried about…\n\nMeanwhile, Raj has fallen asleep on the couch as JD surfs channels on the Lockwood TV. The little ones had been tearing through the house, hopped up on sugar before JD sent them to bed. Everything seems to be quiet now...",

In this loneliness, I sought out the things I had always known and loved, joining a local gaming group, I decided to DM a game, it was a great group and I enjoyed the game thoroughly. However, this is not the story I am telling today.\n\nI joined another game after a while, another great group of people I am glad to have known. Things had not gotten better at that point, I was having fun with my gaming, but I didn't really have a purpose. It was painful and I am glad that I have moved beyond that point in my life.\n\nGetting down to the game, I knew almost immediately that this was going to be interesting. It was a diverse party, an archer, a couple of fighters and a rogueish character. We were a bit light on spellcasters though. I decided to run a Paladin, but I wanted to throw a spin on it. The character was a fanatic, a ruthless one at that. A common tactic was to throw broken glass into enemy's faces if things got out of hand, he also carried caltrops, it was all good fun.\n\nThings progressed, I don't think I can do full justice to the adventures here, so I will focus on the highlights, the most notable moments I can recall.\n\nThe party fought across a vast wasteland of ice, hunting magical relics to prevent a coming darkness. Trolls and orcs were slain in copious numbers. A dragon egg was discovered, a certain member of the party took a personal interest in attempting to hatch it. All of these events and more, so many great memories.\n\nFollowing a lead, the party found itself on a road to the underdark in search of the Drow homeland. By this point, my character had befriended one of the fighters. We will call the fighter Bjern for the sake of this story. After finding the city, completing the mission and escaping, the party found itself being chased by a Drow war party wishing to recover the mcguffin that had been \"retrieved\" by the party.\n\nEventually, it came to a fight, as the path had been blocked by a collapse just near the entrance of the tunnels.\n\nThe party fought admirably, each member paired off with an opposing warrior. My character was pretty reasonably strong at this point, but his focus was on dexterity and charisma, so it took a couple of turns for him to win a bash-v-bash fight. Bjern was one of the stronger fighters on the team, so, naturally, he found himself paired off with the biggest and meanest of the Drow.\n\nThe battle between the two was actually an interesting fight. Bjern was missing a lot, but so was the Drow. Eventually, as always happens in such fights, the Dice swung in the favor of one of the fighters; unfortunately, it was not in Bjern's favor. Bjern took a major hit, a disabling hit.\n\nBjern dropped to his knees, his axe clattering to the ground, shield falling away from him. Kneeling before the Drow, whom raised his blade for a final blow.\n\nI took a reaction, casting a spell that I hoped would save him. The DM initially respected the action... until I rechecked the effect. The spell challenged the Drow to a duel, meaning that he could not run away or move until the battle was joined... it did nothing to stop him from attacking people within reach.\n\nMy character yelled out a challenge that made the surrounding Drow back away. The Drow leader looked away from Bjern toward me. A smile crossed his face as he looked back to Bjern. He drove the sword through Bjern's chest, killing him.\n\nThis was relatively low level, the party didn't have the magic to bring him back... Bjern was gone.\n\nThe duel didn't last long, my character had been holding back spells and tricks. What remained of the Drow Leader would have been pretty charred by righteous flame.\n\nAfter the party finished up the fight, we all took a moment to react to the death. Everyone was respectful, but there was looting of the bodies.\n\nI took a moment to describe my actions. I told the DM that I would carry the body out and that the moment we got to the surface, I would bury Bjern.\n\nIt was a sobering moment in the campaign. Up until that point, things had been pretty light. It was foreshadowing for worse things to come.\n\nIt wasn't immediately after, but soon after that adventure, the party returned to the main hub. The backstory of my character is that he was an orphan bastard of a once-prodigiously virulent royal family. He had no interest in ruling. The time spent in this hub led to the destruction of the thieves guild, which was the most powerful organization in the city. At this point, I had become a de facto leader in the party, I wasn't comfortable in this position, as I was afraid I was going to make a decision that would piss off the party. The best laid plans...\n\nMy character ended up in charge of the Thieves guild. The leader of the guild had a magic item that would disguise their face as one that everyone would know, but was not the true face of the leader. My character was not exactly comfortable with this, but it was essentially a \"be our leader or die\" kind of deal.\n\nTime passed, the Thieves guild changed a bit, until one day, horns blared throughout the town. A royal procession marched through, a man in a litter was brought to the keep under guard. The party quickly discovered that the man was a relative of my character, who wished to take the throne. Insight checks by the rogue led to the discovery that the man was not who he seemed.\n\nThe party infiltrated the keep as the man was giving a speech. During a short break, the man returned to his room, where he found the party waiting for him. He didn't put up a fight and the party began to interrogate him.\n\nThe man revealed that he was an agent of a large Orc Warband... A cataclysmic event, as Orcs in this world were equivalent to Warcraft orcs. My character made a plan... it seemed so good at the time. The people chanted for the agent, my character told him to go to him.\n\n\"King des Torrs! King de Torrs!\" the crowd chanted as the shaking man returned to the balcony. Lifting his hand into the air, the people screamed their love to him.\n\nA figure appeared on the balcony behind him, the crowd screamed as a blade pierced the man's chest. The face of the man... was the leader of the Thieves guild. The figure disappeared, thanks to a magic potion.\n\nMy character ran out, a clean sword in hand, shouting to the people. \"It was the Thieves guild! They killed our noble brother!\" The people were in a fervor, rage spread through them. Small fights broke out as well known thieves were beaten down, crushed by the mob.\n\nThen... it all fell apart. The riot spread throughout the city as it turned on itself. The thieves guild was destroyed... along with most of the city.\n\nOrder eventually returned.. and the survivors crawled back to the keep. My character had assumed the role of the loving brother to the dead lord. I made a speech which I intended to be rousing... but the dice didn't come down for me.\n\nThis is where things really went to shit in a strange way. The speech was rousing... but not enough. I attempted to tell them that the orcs were coming, that all we could do was turn our efforts to the defense of the city. It was beautiful, in a way, the city was essentially split and most began to leave, fleeing for their lives at the mere mention of Orcs.\n\nIt became clear that what remained was not enough. A contingent of guards, some soldiers from the legion, what remained of the city's population and the party... less than a thousand against tens of thousands.\n\nMy character had one belief, the belief in the greater good; that despite his actions, however brutal, he would bring positive change to the world. It had failed, all of it. My character was the villain, his beliefs had destroyed the city and killed thousands, all because he overreached. But that wasn't the end of the tragedy.\n\nIt came down to the last few hours, the orc army approached and a decision had to be made. Who would stay and fight?\n\nThis was where things became really, truly sad. Each person at the table had to search their character's soul. My character's decision was simple, he would stay and die, it was the only way to repay even part of his action. But the others? What did they have to stay for?\n\nThe party split, one fighter left because he was, despite his prowess, a coward when confronted with certain death.\n\nAnother member decided to stay, passing on his possessions to his best friend in the group.\n\nThe dragon-keeper tried to get the dragon to leave with him, but the dragon decided to stay and fight.\n\nI don't know if that does it justice, but I've never seen anything like that in a game. Because of a bad decision, characters had to search their souls for what they would do when given the choice between death and dishonor...\n\nThe battle commenced, with the help of the garrison, the remaining party members fought the army to a stand-still. One by one the party fell, the city was destroyed and every man died to the last... but the Orc warband lost so many of their number that they couldn't continue past the city.\n\nIt was beautiful, it was poetry and it broke my heart.\n\nWhat I have just described was months of play, months of getting to know and love each character and the world they inhabited... and that party, that dynamic, was gone forever... and it was all my fault.",

        "text": "“Listen,” Boone whispered huskily, breaking the silence. “We’re near a Legion slave camp. I’ve...” He cleared his throat uncomfortably. “..Been here before. Let’s get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I’m taking the shot. You don’t like that, you’re on your own.” I flashed him a toothy grin. “As long as you don’t mind me joining the fun.” “I don’t think I’d hold it against you,” he said, a grin of his own tugging at the corners of his mouth. \n\nWe peered over the rocks at the encampment called Cottonwood Cove. There were several buildings, with several Legionnaire patrols around them, all armed to the teeth; Boone and I counted at least fifteen of Caesar’s men, not counting the mongrels that accompanied them or the men inside the buildings. If we were going to take them on, it’d be a helluva fight, but if we stuck to the surrounding hills and relatively out of sight, I figured we could make it out alive; we’d have the high ground, and there were only two narrow routes the Legion could take if they wanted to flank our position, seeing as the only other option would be to retreat into the lakelurk infested Colorado River. If we laid down a heavy, sustained hail of bullets and left no room for stragglers, we could potentially raze the slaving bastards’ whole camp. I took another look through my binoculars. \n\nI spotted my quarry: three individuals, one teenaged male and two women, locked in a cage next to the largest building in the complex, by the docks. They were bound by their hands. They were Frank Weathers’ family; the people I was hired to rescue from their Legion captors and return to Frank in the Aerotech Office Park, a shanty town near New Vegas. Another look, then I cursed under my breath; they were wearing slave collars. If the Legion got an inkling that I was here to save these people, they’d be dead after the first volley of gunfire; slave collars had explosive failsafes, and whether it be from the press of a button, or a tripped proximity sensor, these collars usually left rebellious prisoners without heads. \n\nI glanced over at Boone, planning to ask for his input on the situation at hand, but any questions I had about his sentiments were answered; his lips were curled into a nasty grin, with no trace of the usual stoic grimace that adorned his face. He was gripping his rifle so hard his knuckles were white, and the hand he used to adjust his shades was shaky. I slapped at his arm to break his trance. We started moving along the left side of the ridge towards the road. \n\n“We wait until dark,” I told him. “I’ll take the left side of the ridge, and you take the other. We start clearing out this place at my signal.” \n“What’s the signal?” \nI pulled a small block of plastic explosive out from my bag. “You see that boulder that looks like a Nuka Cola bottle up on the northern side of the canyon?” I pointed towards the spot, and he nodded. “I’ll sneak over there and set this charge, then detonate it when the time is right. When this little baby goes off, start shooting. We’re not letting a single one of them get out of here alive. Boone?” Boone was staring at me, no, past me, his eyes twitching and flashing with murderous intent. I looked behind me, and my smile disappeared. \n\nThere were crosses lining the road behind me. Three of these had people lashed to them. Carved into two of their chests were the letters “NCR”. The third was naked, though he sported the tribal tattoos that Kahns usually wore. His skin was covered in blisters, and his ribcage could be seen through it. Boone walked up to the crosses, producing a combat knife from his waistband. When I tried to grab his shoulder to stop him, he roughly batted my hand away with a snarl. “I’m cutting them down,” he growled through clenched teeth. I stepped in front of him. “What if one of their messengers see us? No way,” I reasoned. “After we’re done here, we’ll cut these poor bastards down and bury them. You have my word.” Boone stood there for a moment, his expression unreadable. He was about to finally speak, when we heard a wheezing voice behind us. \n\n“Water,” the crucified Kahn managed. “Please..” I shot a look at Boone, silently cursing him for putting us in this situation. He scowled at me, knowing what choices we now had, and the urgency we had to make them; we could cut him down and give him what he requested, but if a Legion messenger saw a newly vacant cross, he would undoubtedly be suspicious, and if we left the poor son of a bitch up there, he might call even more attention to us, ruining our element of surprise. Either way, he would be a liability to us. The third option, though it was less than morally gray, was looking to be the best option: silence him, permanently; he must have been up on that cross for days, slowly cooking in the Mojave sun, making reasoning with the man a near impossibility. If I wanted to justify my actions, I could say it was a mercy killing – though when I would hunker down for the night, I would know, in my heart of hearts, we murdered that man, and that sleep wouldn’t come to relieve me. \n\nAs I unsheathed my own blade, Boone turned and started slowly making his way towards his position. I could feel the disgust emanating from him. He looked over his shoulder at me, stone-faced. “Do what you have to do. We start shooting at your signal.” I started walking towards the crucified man, whose breathing quickened. As my shadow loomed over him, he tried to scream, though his impossibly dry throat could only produce barely audible wheezes. Thankfully, nobody saw or heard what came next. \n\nThe sun set, and the moon took its place. It was a clear night, and the Legion soldiers were huddled around a campfire, cooking their gecko meat and sharing swigs of Nuka Cola. Their dogs sat on their haunches next to their masters, relaxed but ready. The Weathers family sat in their cage, their stomachs rumbling when the wind blew the smoke their way. It was quiet except for the crackling of the fire, and the hushed conversations of the Legionnaires. They were unaware of the two figures crouched on the rocks on the surrounding hills, and the bottle-shaped rock with half a pound of primed explosives adhered to it. It was time. \n\nThe explosion that came next wasn’t a large one, but it was enough to send sharp sandstone and limestone fragmentation hailing down on the Legion soldiers, tearing through limb and muscle on its way down. I could feel the shockwave from where I was perched, but my aim wasn’t affected by it. The sharp reports from Boone’s .308 rifle were amplified by the canyon’s walls, similar to the thunderclaps my own rifle produced. The ones that survived the first volley scrambled behind cover, their yelling and swearing echoing off the canyon walls. Before we could reload our weapons, they started returning suppressing fire, though the rounds pinged off rocks nowhere near us. The tactical advantage we had was that the canyon essentially became a resonance chamber, and unless you looked for the muzzle flash, if would be difficult to place where the ambush was coming from, especially under the cover of night. \n\n“IT’S COMING FROM THE OVERLOOK!” I heard one scream partially from behind cover, before I spotted him and put a round into his lungs. I stayed low and strafed towards the road on the left, praying that Boone would be moving toward his side. The Legion was starting to make their way towards the hills, bounding from cover to cover and returning fire to keep us pinned down. Boone’s rifle was booming at a quicker pace now. I tossed a grenade in their general direction, and felt the following whumping sound shake the earth beneath my feet. A smoldering disembodied hand flew past me and into the rocks beside me and slid down to the ground, making a wet smacking sound on impact. I gnashed my teeth in frustration; they were getting closer, and this was starting to go south on us.",

        "text": "The story began in Rome, Brutii faction, Southern Italy, City Tarentum, Year 270 BC. Brutii Faction was expanding towards the East and Tibelius Brutus, the Brutii faction leader, went to counquer the Greek and Macedonian territories with his son Amulius Brutus.\n\nRome was still relatively small compared to its glory to come and was still under the rule of the senate. With three factions: Julii, Scipii and Brutii acting under the orders of the senate and S.P.Q.R. faction.\n\nFullfilling the senate missions Brutii started capturing western territories of the Greek and Macedonians, Unfortunately Tibelius Brutus died of old age in 255 BC during his conquest. Amulius Brutus Took up his fathers mantlet and became the faction leader of Brutii, carrying on the conquest of Macedonia. He Achieved many victories, most notable of which was near the Macedonian City of Thessalonica, where Amulius Brutus and his army of 1000 strong defeated a Macedonian army of 3000 strong led by Captain Agathocles in 254 BC. After which, he was regarded as the strongest and wisest general in the Brutii faction. \n\nUnfortunately He did not manage to see his beloved wife and home again because where the Greek and Macedonians failed, god prevailed. A plague struck in Thessalonica and sadly shortly after getting the honour of being regarded as the strongest and wisest general, he died of the plague in the year 251 BC.\n\nYet before leaving for Geece, Amulius Brutus managed to have 3 sons, Cassius Brutus, Cornelius Brutus and lastly the youngest son, Quintis Brutus who will be the main focus of this story. Brutii faction looked towards these now young men in hopes of one day having another great general rise from their ranks. Cassius Brutus indeed started conquering in the north.But only achieving unimpressive Victories against Germanic and Gallic tribes. Cornelius Brutus went to manage City Croton, right south of the City Tarentum, where Quintis Brutus Decided to stay. \n\nAs time went on, Brothers Cornelius Brutus and Quintis Brutus Delved in diplomacy, gaining favour within the senate and managing their respective Cities. Never quite living up to the Legend of their Father, but still becoming great in their own right. Quintis Brutus even managed to become the Pontifex Maximus in the senate.\n\nBut it was not meant to last. Brutii faction was already conquering turkey and even Cassius Brutus had great success conquering Dacians and warring against Scythians in the north east in spite of hopes of the senate. The people of Rome regarded Brutii faction highly and didn’t think much of the other factions. The fame of Brutii became so high that the senate showed a lot of displeasure and treated Brutii faction with hostility where-ever they could get away with it.\n\nQuintis Brutus was replaced in the senate and unable to bear his life work becoming ruin, unable to match his father in fame and might even atleast in diplomacy, Quintis went slowly mad. Quintis Brutus became to be known and Quintis the Mad as he lashed out and often bit his servants and even guests. Cornelius Brutus, with a cold heart, decided to banish Quintis the Mad from Any City under the current territory of Brutii. As a final act of mercy, he sent Quintis the mad alongside with his 48 personal guard to fight against the nearby rebel force of 1100, so he would atleast die with honour.\n\nQuintis the mad was aware that this was going to be his final fight, but since his brother was the Brutii faction leader he couldn’t disobey his command. He gathered the best equipment and the mightiest horses he could find and rode out with his personal guard against the rebels. Quintis may have been mad, but he was not stupid, He used hit and run tactics, making a rebel unit panic and rout after which he slaughtered them before turning his eyes on another unit. Thus he killed and killed and killed. In the end he had 12 personal guards left and the rebels had 1064 deaths in 222 BC He had surpassed his Father for the first time. Thus Quintis the Mad truly embraced his nickname and rode forth. His brother Cornelius Brutus heard of this amazing tale, but since Quintis the Mad was banished, there was no celebration, no mark of this tale remained, It slowly started to fade alongside the thousand corpses on that field.\n\nHowewer, Cornelius Brutus recognised his brother’s achievement in secret and sent him a message. Quintis the mad was still banished, and would not be able to command any Romans other than his personal guard, still, Cornelius decided to start sending Quintis a stipend of 2000 denarii annually and told him to travel north, to redeem his name in fighting against the Germanic and Gallic tribes, to conquer the Briton territories in mainland Europe to find glory in war.\n\nWhile Quintis the Mad was traveling to north, Cornelius Brutus had enough of the pestering senate and decided to capture Rome itself. Scipii and Julii legions were off conquering Spain and northen Africa, thus Rome fell surprisingly fast, the S.P.Q.R. legions were shattered, the Citizens of Rome itself slaughtered alongside the senate in the cold revenge of Cornelius Brutus. Revenge for what they had done to his family, thus Cornelius Brutus became to be known as Cornelius the Cold Hearted as he began his Conquest of the remaining Roman factions, but that is a story for another time.\n\nSlowly Quintis the Mad Conquered northen Europe and after that, he was sent to Conquer france Controlled by the Julii faction. He never got any troops from his Brutii bretheren, so his army consisted of Any and all mercenaries he could find. He fought and Conquered until there was nothing left to conquer in Europe. His sword knew the blood of rebels, Germania, Gallia, Briton and even Julii. Thus finally in the year 200 BC he was renamed from Quintis the Mad to Quintis Victor. After more than two decades he had redeemed his honour and was acknowledged to be an even greater general than his father Amulius Brutus.\n\nHe settled in Condate Redonum, A town he captured in northern France. He had 3 sons and a daughter with his wife Aurelia in his lifetime, which is rather impressive because all of them were born after he went mad and started biting people. But his wife’s kinks are a story for another time, Quintis the Victor had earned his rest and sent his sons off to conquer whatever was left after his mighty tale.\n",

        "text": "One of our main campaigns revolves around our Holy Knight and his expanding Church of Dickbutt. We have a limited amount of time before Dickbutt's nemesis, Clthulu, awakens and tries to destroy the world.\n\nWe were rifted outside of town, we had no idea where we were. We decide to head into town to try and figure out where we are. Maybe get some food and transportation. We get into town and most of the inhabitants are pale and wondering around aimlessly. When we try to talk to them it's like we don't even exist. They bump into us and keep on moving like nothing was on their way.\n\nWe look around and most of the town is this way. We only see a dozen or so who are conscious and aware of what's happening, but they don't seem to care.\n\n\"What's the fuck is going on here?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Let's see if there's anyone outside of town who could tell us what's happening.\" So we head out and look around. We stumble upon a little shack outside of town. We were hoping that whatever happened to the towns people hasn't made it's way out here yet. We knock on the door and some old guy answers the door saying:\n\n\"The fuck do you want you piece of shit?\"\n\n\"Excuse me sir. We don't mean to intrude, but we were wondering if we could ask you about the townsfolk.\"\n\n\"Yeah sure. I can answer your questions for you.\" The man opens the door and takes a piss on our Holy Knight. He stands there quietly and takes it. It doesn't get angry or yell. He quietly takes it. The man slams the door and our Knight just walks off and leaves the group.\n\nAfter a few hours of gathering up what little info we can we figure out that a new church showed up in town and all of a sudden the town started going to shit. We decide to hunt down our Knight because he is the whole reason we're here. When we finally find him he has a bucket and he smells terrible.\n\n\"Dude what the hell? Where have you been?\"\n\n\"OUR BENEVOLENT GOD HAS BEEN WRONGED AND THE HARLOTS WHO HAVE CROSSED US MUST BE PUNISHED\" it turns he has spent the last few hours collecting the worst smelling things he can find (cow shit, vomit, spoiled milk, urine, and things we dared not ask about).\n\nHe storms up to the door of the house and starts slamming on it. The door opens and he throws the bucket without looking. He covers this little girl in everything he spent all that time collecting. She starts crying and we fucking run for it. We run for the church because we have a mission and it's Thursday. Who's going to be at church? Everyone apparently.\n\nWe get there and everyone from town is at the church. Fortunately for us they're all the brain dead people from earlier. We decide to loom around and we find a stairway leading under the building. We head down and find a room with a table and a button. Our Holy Knight being the leader he is walks right up and presses the button. Nothing. We find nothing else in the room so we head back up the stairs.\n\nWe. Fucked. Up.\n\nEveryone was dead. The floors had opened up and dropped all of the people into a trap filled with spikes. We didn't even have time to mourn what we did before we were attacked. Three demons attacked us.\n\n\"You'll pay for what you've done to these people!\"\n\n\"Um. Not to point fingers man, but you are kind of the one who killed them.\"\n\n\"Silence. We must banish these servants of Clthulu for their misdeeds.\"\n\nThis huge battle ensues and we end up killing the demons and our knight gets a reward from dickbutt. The location of his holy weapon. As we leave the few townspeople who were unaffected confront us.\n\n\"Fear not good people for we have slain the beasts and set you free.\"\n\n\"YOU KILLED EVERYONE IN THE CHURCH AND SHIT BUCKETED MY DAUGHTER!\"\n\n\"FOR DICKBUTT!\"\n\nSo yeah..

        "text": "Backstory: Long ago, Pelor, god of the sun, went evil, and decided to destroy all life in the world by triggering a supernova.  The moon (and moon goddess) and the Goddess of Luck placed themselves in front of the blast, saving life on the planet, but turning the surface into a wasteland.  The surviving races went underground, where dwarven society became the primary surviving civilization, at least in the immediate area of the campaign.  Several of the other races can be found in the dwarven cities, but dwarven culture and dwarven deities reign supreme.\n\nThe present day: Our heroes began this journey in a bar.  Krogg, Large half-troll science experiment (product of the campaign's liberal and slightly ridiculous custom race builder), cleric of the god of Extortion, and legbreaker for local organized crime, was having a drink before going to collect on a debt.  His mark appeared outside, so Krogg stepped out looking to collect on the debt.  However, something strange was going on.  The mark looked like he was black out drunk, smelled like a brewery, and was trying to bite another passerby, starting a fight.  Krogg went to \"dissuade him\" and collect on his debt.  However, after a small application of violence, the man, instead of falling unconscious like  the usual legbreaking missions, instead exploded in a pile of goo!\n\n Krogg went to go to his house to discover why this man had exploded (and loot his belongings to settle his debts), accompanied by the people he found at the bar willing to accompany him:\n\nZook, gnome Vivesectionist Alchemist.  The local pharmacologist and amoral medical researcher.\n\nJovak, orc gunslinger.  Had a blunderbuss he found in the trash somewhere.  THe local murderhobo, he had Knowledge: Local, the only one in the party to do so.\n\nZom, plantfolk Medium and collector of tales.  The only goodly-ish member of the party, he went along to make sure we didn't actually murder anyone.\n\nand Slag, dwarven rogue and general ne'er do well.\n\nOur heroes tracked Krogg's \"debtor\" to his house in the suburbs of the city.  Upon examination, they discovered his manservant, a cowardly man who insisted his master was not home.  Krogg \"invited himself in\", causing the man to point out the trapdoor in the house, and promptly flee for his life.  Inside the basement was a chest, and several barrels of what appeared to be alcohol.  Slag attempted to open the chest, triggering a trap which burst open the barrels and unleashed more \"drunkards\"!  The alcohol zombies were easily defeated, but Slag and Zook failed their Fortitude saves, unbeknownst to them.  Our heroes now had all the pieces to the puzzle:  The \"drunkards\" were in fact a new type of undead, and were being deliberately made somewhere in the city!\n\nOur heroes tracked the source of the barrels to a local brewery, where the necromancer responsible for the alcohol zombies revealed himself as the manservant!  Combat ensued, with our heroes fighting from a distance, making sure to stay far away from the (trapped) vats of alcohol, and the zombies within.  Upon defeating the necromancer, our heroes retreated to the inn, content with their day's work.\n\nOur heroes took rooms upstairs, with Krogg and Jovak taking the largest room, and Zook and Slag sharing a room, staying together for as much comfort as possible while maintaining strength in numbers.  Unfortunately, Zook and Slag's earlier failed Fortitude saves caused them to zombify in the night.  Upon rising from the dead, they promptly attacked the rest of the party.  Fortunately, Krogg kept Jovak from being hit while dispatching the new zombies, preventing the loss of further party members.\n\n\nHaving prepared for this eventuality, Zook's player promptly came in with a second character prepared, a Mesmerist.  Casting Hide From Undead, he attempted to follow the party to safety.  Unfortunately, their only way out was by way of a stairwell which had attracted another zombie.  The zombie was easily dispatched, but the Mesmerist was hit, forcing him to kill himself to save himself from zombification.\n\nParty members killed: 3.  Next time: A series of improbable random encounters!",

        "text": "The journey home after our [escape from Oringold](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5shk96/dd_the_rbg_gang_escape_from_oringold_city/) ([the city in flames behind us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo) ) was pretty uneventful, all things considered. By the time we picked up Lady Deathshroud and Groin the alchemist, they had murdered the innkeeper where they were staying and stolen some horses. When the rest of the gang pointed out that we would be travelling through dense woodland most of the way, they let the horses go, and the horses milled around outside the inn, chewing on the turf.\n\nWe got back to our base, and set up an alchemist's lab for Groin there. Lady's dog-headed abomination baby was growing up fast and could now walk and talk, so we had a montage where each of the gang did some parenting. Coldsteel taught him how to set up a camp, Lucifer taught him how to shoot a deer, Razorblade taught him how to make poison and Blackstone taught him how to talk to women. \n\nThen one day Groin came back from the market in the nearby town of Thorpton with a fistful of wanted posters. The pictures looked quite familiar; \n\n&gt; Coldsteel the Berbarian + wolf, wanted for robbing Oringold museum\n\n&gt;Lucifer \"The Betrayer\" Shadowthane, wanted for murder/regicide\n\n&gt;Razorblade Spiderblade, wanted for murder\n\n&gt;Lady Deathshroud, wanted for murder and poisoning Oringold's water supply\n\n&gt;Blackstone Darkstone, wanted for murder and poisoning Oringold's water supply\n\n\nWe talked about the problem, and it soon became clear that no-one had any plan beyond \"kill the paladins, maybe?\" and certainly no plan for when the next lot of paladins inevitably turned up.\n\nColdsteel found himself facing a grim choice- if he killed a bunch of paladins and went on the run, he would probably never be welcome in a town or city again. However, unlike the rest of the party, he wasn't wanted for mass-murder.\nWhile the others were arguing, Coldsteel loaded up his sled with the priceless cultural artefacts he had stolen, and handed himself in to the paladins.\n\nWith Coldsteel missing, the gang decided to head out to the king of the forest's lair deeper in the woods and hide out there, leaving two of the dogsnakes to protect the secret base. The gang sent Groin ahead with the abomination baby and the yellow and black dogsnake as they packed up the valuables in the base.\n\nWhile they were camping, Blackstone realised that the description and image of him on the wanted posters was very vague, essentially \"Man in a top hat who smells of stale urine and aftershave\". Seeing this, he realised that by changing his hat and his smell, he could pass for another person, and perhaps avoid arrest, and to this end he went out into the forest.\n\nComing to a clearing, Blackstone happened upon a [family of skunks frolicking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8w-RAsBxk), and saw a solution to his problems. He charged forward, hoping to catch them unawares, but they sprayed him and retreated to their burrow, leaving Blackstone gagging into his hand. Their smell was so powerful that it rendered Blackstone unable to use his psionic powers, so instead he chased the skunks to the burrow and got down on his knees to try and drag one out. Terrified, the skunk clawed Blackstone's face, and he scrambled back, screaming in pain.\n\nAttracted by the ruckus, Lady, Razorblade and Lucifer emerged from the trees. They were disinterested in the skunks until Blackstone offered them several hundred gold for the creature's intact pelts. Lady took Blackstone's cane and tried to use it to pry the skunks out, but she got it jammed between some roots and it broke. After that, she tried drowning the skunks, but couldn't produce enough water with her magic to fill the burrow. The angry skunks were now damp, but no closer to being dead.\n\nDefeated, the party left the skunks, vowing to return the next day, when Lady had prayed once more to the ideals of death and darkness, regaining her spells.\n\nOn the second day of what will hereby be known as *Skunkgate*, Blackstone lit a fire in front of the set and fanned smoke into it, after which Lady summoned a creature to dispatch and retrieve the skunk family.\n\nAngry at being left to pack up the camp while Blackstone was mucking about, Lucifer and Razorblade headed further into the woods by themselves. Blackstone and Lady returned to find that they were nowhere to be seen. Blackstone, an iconoclast as ever, declared that he would make his own way to the double-secret hideout, and forged ahead into the woods.\n\nUnfortunately for Blackstone, he had no idea where he was going. He stumbled through the undergrowth, the pelts of the unfortunate skunk family clutched in one hand, and ended up nose-to-nose with a paladin scout. He panicked, directing his considerable psionic might at the scout in the form of mind bullets, but the scout interrupted the flow of his mental powers with a punch to the nose, and followed that up with a blow to the back of the head before taking the now unconscious Blackstone captive.\n\nWhen Lucifer and Razorblade returned to the campsite, they found Lady waiting for them there, and Blackstone long gone. Lucifer was able to track Blackstone by his smell, but found signs of a struggle, a second set of tracks, and a thin trail of blood leading towards town. Deciding to cut their losses, the remaining three party members headed out towards the king of the forest's lair. Unfortunately, the paladins had beat them there, and they found the place turned over. The dogsnake they had sent with Groin lay dead, bisected on the floor, and both Groin and Lady's dog-headed child were nowhere to be found.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackstone was reunited with Coldsteel, and after a brief interrogation the paladins set them and a small armed escort on the road to Oringold where Blackstone and Coldsteel would stand trial.\n\nWith all the others missing in action, Lucifer, Razorblade and Lady decided to mount a rescue. They headed to town, leaving Lady in a ditch in an outlying farmstead as she was too conspicuous in her armour. Lucifer and Razorblade split up to search for the paladins, agreeing to meet later. \n\nRazorblade was the first to find the inn where the paladins were staying, but couldn't find the prisoners in the first two rooms schlee searched. Rather than spend more time searching, Razorblade decided to set fire to the inn and wait for the paladins to evacuate the prisoners.\n\nLucifer noticed the fire at the inn and went to investigate. Outside the inn he saw the leader of the paladins directing the firefighting effort, and decided that this was his chance to assassinate him. Lucifer fired a volley of arrows into the paladin's back at point blank range. Unfortunately, the paladin was still standing at the end of the volley, and turned round and walloped him.\n\nMeanwhile, Razorblade, not having spotted any of the captive party members outside, decided to search the cellar of the inn. There schlee found several preserved hams and local beers, but no sign of Coldsteel, Blackstone or Groin. By the time Razorblade emerged from the cellar, Lucifer was already a prisoner. Watching from the shadows, Razorblade decided schler best bet was to stalk the guards and pick them off until the odds were more equitable, perhaps interrogating one or two along the way. The paladin captain gave an order to one of them, and they started off towards the general store. Razorblade stalked behind, following them into the store, and unfortunately for Razorblade, the paladin captain followed shortly after, shutting the door behind them. The fight was short and one-sided, as Razorblade had hoped, but it was not in Razorblade's favour.\n\nThe paladins picked up Lady from her ditch the following morning.\n  \nJoin us next time for the gang's exciting adventures in jail.\n\n",

        "text": "This story assumes knowledge of the Star Wars universe as presented by the movies.\n\nSWSE stands for Star Wars: Saga Edition, a Star Wars tabletop role-playing game. Every Sunday, myself, my buddy Austin, my cousins JC and Jake, my brother Scott, and their friends Duncan, Martin, Sam, and the occasional +1, get together to play, usually with several missing.\n\nI had fallen into a bit of a pit. My character, Darth Imperitus, was a very balanced character, or in gamer terms, useless. Darth Carnatus, Jake's character, outclassed him in force usage. Loinclothed Madman, Austin's character, outclassed him in utility. Richard, Scott's character, outclassed him in combat. Lu'urn the Large, JC's character, outclassed every conceivable being in tanking. Campaigns were unfun and dragged on. Who enjoys being useless?\n\nEnter: Abraham McCree. McCree from Overwatch and Han Solo had a baby, and this was the result. A space cowboy from the space west. But this was no one trick pony. Abraham had connections and a silver tongue, making him a natural at deceiving the party when it came to his true purpose: infiltrating the party on behalf of the Empire.\n\nAbraham McCree is an inquisitor. His job is to hunt down force users. Our happy little party has three: Loinclothed madman, a Sith alchemist; Darth Carnatus, a Sith lord; and Darth Excessus, Carnatus' apprentice.\n\nAt this point in the campaign, the party is invading Hutt space, which was originally meant to lure out Ventress, Carnatus' former master, but by this point she's dead and we're in too deep. The first campaign involving McCree was the invasion of Hasco, a Hutt planet protected by shields and ion cannons. The invasion took place over two sessions, and two things happened:\n\n1) McCree, while busting out of prison, almost successfully sabotaged the mission. A thermal detonator, big bomb, was chucked in a group of allies. \"Thinking quickly,\" McCree tosses it elsewhere, which happened to be very nearby the control panel. Darth Excessus, however, saves it by force throwing it elsewhere still, away from the computers.\n\n2) After the mission, McCree asks Loinclothed Madman about Lu'urn the Large, who is rancor sized, sentient, and wielding starship batteries. During the conversation, Madman, trusting me fully, mentions alchemy. Inquisitor McCree, having knowledge of Sith stuff, recognizes Madman as a Sith Alchemist and Lu'urn as a chrysalis beast, an ordinary being made larger by the dark size. This information, being of severe consequence as Sith alchemy was thought dead, is immediately relayed to the Empire, secret to the party.\n\nSo now, after all this, the party decides to take a little side campaign to get our alchemist some cloning technology, which would allow him to clone Lu'urn among other things and create an unstoppable army. For this little side campaign, we (Myself,Loinclothed Madman, Lu'urn, and Adrienne Barbeaubot) go to Camino, where the clone armies were manufactured during the Clone Wars. Imagine this: myself and my two primary targets head to a largely imperial planet from which there is little escape, as Camino is an ocean planet with some floating facilities.\n\nWe arrive, after Adrienne jumps out from low orbit, leaving me as the only one inconspicuous enough to speak to the man approaching our landed shuttle. The madman is a notorious galactic terrorist and Lu'urn is Lu'urn. I step outside, flash my badge, and in short order I'm speaking to the director of the facility.\n\nI had far more resources as an inquisitor than I ever knew I had. I had shock troopers with me in the conference room, and others ready to move in, in addition to others still ready to blow the ship I had arrived on with Lu'urn in it.\n\nI call the madman in to the conference room, remarking out of character that getting the tech would be easier than I thought, influencing his meta in my favor. He enters the room, I jam his comms, he gets boxed in by other troopers. At the same moment, our transport is destroyed. Lu'urn lived and didn't care, that monster.\n\nIn light of all this, Madman chucks a thermal detonator. It crits. In the SWSE system, crits are an auto-success with double damage. A thermal detonator does a load of damage on a crit. He and I spend a destiny point (instant success for most things, very limited) to not get hit. All other shock troopers are vaporized. We're both knocked prone. Another shock trooper walks in.\n\nMadman teleports beside me and stabs me with a lightsaber, as I'm still prone. The shock trooper flamethrowers Madman. I shoot madman, which gets blocked. This clusterfuck continues and I'm prone throughout the whole thing.\n\nEventually, while the remaining shock trooper is dragging me away and the other 7 who blew he ship return, Madman mind tricks the one. He didn't make the best move, thank god, and just told him to leave.\n\nI crawl out of the room and chuck a thermal detonator in. It crits.\n\nAfter some deliberation it's ruled Madman has the time to run, as the detonators are on a timer. The madman grapples me, and we're both prone. My backup arrives. The madman teleports to a nearby door and opens it. I burn a destiny point on my attack, an immediate success, and shoot him for 90 damage with his damage reduction. My backup shoots him and kills him. All that was a very stressful but fun ~4 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, a dejected Lu'urn was atop the facility searching for other ships. What he found wasn't big enough to fit him. A transport flies in, bringing in an EMP device I requested. It can fit him. He shoots at it and scares it away. Why??\n\nI receive a transmission from the ship, saying they couldn't land and were taking fire. In light of this, I call in fighters and bombers. Lu'urn jumps into the water, using his massive jetpack to not sink.\n\nDown here, the adrienne barbeaubot reveals their plan. They had jammed the water intake with the corpses of sealife. They swim in. Lu'urn shoots the intake for some reason. Adrienne is launched forward. I forget exactly what happens, but at one point the platform begins tipping from a destroyed support.\n\nIn response to this, I call an orbital strike and leave.\n\nAdrienne finds Madman's body and cuts off his head, for use later. The facility sinks but everyone survives, despite being stranded. Adrienne is at the bottom of the ocean with Madman's head, and Lu'urn is floating near the surface outside of his armor, as he is an invertebrate. That is where we left off.\n\nI don't know how well I conveyed the experience, but that was the most fun I had in SWSE since we started.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5toc5p/dark_heresy_party_chases_carjackers_starts_a/",
        "text": "Last week, I ran a game of Dark Heresy for some friends from highschool. We'd taken what I'd approximate to be a month's break from the last time we'd played, in which they cheesed my BBEG and started a gang war on Volg, and they were using their old characters. I decided, for lack of any better ideas, to make a call-back game of sorts. See, when I played with these guys in highschool I ran the Dark Heresy 1E module over lunchtimes. It was kind of a mess and ended in a near TPK, in part because I kinda sucked as a GM back then. I decided, hey, why not show these guys what has been happening ever since their dramatic sacrifices at the Cathedral of Stern Hope? \n\nAt the time, I called the current mission “Return to Iocanthos.” After last week's session, I changed the name to be more fitting: “Flames of Iocanthos.”\n\nThe dramatis Personae were as follows:\n\nTauron Gallus: A nobleman from a merchant house, who had apparently decided that being a hired killer appealed to him more than being a pampered son. He was a swords-guy, replete with plenty of blades he didn't get the chance to use. His player hadn't had the best of luck in previous missions, and as a result he had only one more fate point left to burn. He was the de facto boss of the party, a charismatic guy with a decent handle on affairs.\n\nNihilus Xanthia: Another nobleman, this one a guardsman from a house that patronized a Guard Regiment. Again, due to being filthy rich he was weighed down with as many weapons as he could carry, ranging from a chain-axe to a lasgun to several firebombs. Nihilus' player was somewhat obnoxious, leaning into That Guy territory (I'll get into why later) but he was also a good friend.\n\nPhrenz: A newcomer, due to the player getting tired of his previous character and wanting to try something new. An agile former bilge-rat aboard one of the less pleasant Chartist Ships, he was a shrill-voiced, paranoid thrill-killer with a few screws loose from the word go. His player, ironically, is one of my most restrained and relaxed players. He played almost exclusively as a ranged character.\n\nRemy Vard De Vern: The odd duck. He was a cleric, and the only guy to use splat-content (in this case, the Banisher sub-class that gave him access to the From Beyond trait). He took this PRIEST OF THE EMPEROR stereotype in a bizarre direction, swapping out firebrand fanatacism for a more ominous “win at all costs” mentality and very little in the way of restraint (or, as we'll see later, common sense).\n\nSawney Krak: A techpriest played by a younger brother of Tauron's player. He didn't contribute much to the campaign, mostly serving as another body in the turn order, but he wasn't obstructive and he helped where he could. His biggest strength was that he could drive groundcars.\n\nDexter Strength: A cleric played by the other younger brother of Tauron's player. He also didn't contribute much to the campaign, but due to him and Sawney coming with Tauron they were just kind of there. It was my attempt to keep them engaged that kind of kickstarted this mess, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe group's inquisitor, Inquisitor Alighieri, was a paranoid asshole who saw the party as disposable errand-boys. He'd just found out that an old acolyte of his mentor had been spotted by an Imperial contact on Iocanthos, and he wanted the party to find this old man and bring him back without drawing too much attention to themselves. Of course, because an acolyte's job can never be easy the contact who spotted the old man in the first place is sequestered in an old manse located somewhere in the wastelands outside of the space port. All this, and the Inquisitor thought it only somewhat important to mention that the Imperial authorities were having trouble with the local Ashleen.\n\nWell, with leads that shaky it's almost no surprise the party went off the rails. While looking for clues to the location of either their contact or their VIP, the group decided to swing by a nomad market called the Greysky Market. They got there late due to a crappy navigation roll. Once they finally did get there, everyone jumped out and wandered the market, running across recurring NPCs and getting equipment. Well, almost everyone. That's where the problems started.\n\nSawney and Dexter had elected to stay with the car to watch for thieves while the other four wandered around the market. I'd made a point that it was late, and that the market would be mostly devoid of non-offworlders and prospective thieves, but the kids didn't seem all that interested. To give them something to do, I decided to throw a small encounter their way. So as these two acolytes of the Inquisition relaxed in the back of their borrowed sedan, somebody knocked on the window. When neither Sawney nor Dexter responded, that knock was repeated. By hammer.\n\nOf course, both Sawney and Dexter were pretty good with their guns (the latter had quick draw) and blasted away at the would-be car thieves. Within a turn, the interlopers backed off. The rest of the party came running, just in time to see several other cars peal away from the market at high speeds. Sawney and Dexter seemed pretty satisfied, sitting in the bullet-riddled car and offering one-liners. I figured that this would be end-scene.\n\nFor some reason, Nihilus decided that he wouldn't stand for this. He wanted very much to jump into the car and get Sawney to drive him after these guys. The rest of the party is not 100% on board with this, and some heated words are exchanged between players OOC. Eventually Nihilus badgered the rest of the party into following the thieves' trail.\n\nAfter a tracking roll and a few more moments of bickering, the group rolled up outside an old, ramshackle refinery sitting at the edge of a field of ghostfire flowers. This was a three-story building, equal parts wood and concrete, with lights on the first floor and several glass windows. The stolen cars sat in a line in front of the building. Once again, Sawney and Dexter sat in the car while the other four dismounted to enter the slobberknocker. I asked the party if they had a plan. Nihilus responded with “LEEROY JENKINS” and that put paid to any planning.\n\nWell, they're about a metre or two from the door when one of the bandits stuck her head out. She asked who the party is. Phrenz responded with a shrill, unintelligible shriek. Bandit girl repeated “WHO'S THAT STUMBLING AROUND IN THE DARK?” Nihilus does his best “grizzled badass” voice. Bandit girl slammed the door and yells “IT'S THE ARBITES! GET THE GUNS” and everything goes to hell.\n\nTauron wins initiative and charges in the door. His player asks if he can charge the closest guy to the door, and I tell him that he has a valid target. However, he trips two attacks of opportunity, as the bandits had a chance to arm themselves. As he runs in the front door and rounds on the first guy he sees, he's shot from two different directions by a shotgun-wielding bandit and a sniper. Turns out only the first guy was necessary. Tauron failed his dodge check, and soaked up six different hits of 8+ damage. He was the least-armoured of the group, so this blast put him down like a dog. His player requested to burn fate so he could at least take a swing at the guy he was trying to hit, did so, and missed anyway. First turn of combat, and one PC was down.\n\nThe rest of the party decided to change tact at this point. Nihilus took cover in the doorway while Remy tossed a firebomb into the front hall. The guy that Tauron had attacked was soaked in flames, and died from massive damage. Phrenz took the window to his left, and I informed the player that he saw no less than four bandits with various weapons preparing to defend their base. The shotgun guy who'd felled Tauron took cover at the edge of the hall, just beyond the spreading flames, and two more fuckers were lining up on the right side to try and pepper the group with bullets. To make matters worse, someone somewhere in the house loudly broadcasted the group's numbers and positions to the rest of the bandits.\n\nThis is where Remy made his play. He decided that, as a banisher-priest of the Emperor, this situation needed MORE FIRE. So, as the bandits began to retreat from the flames and Nihilus provided cover fire, Remy circled around the side of the building and began to head towards the back. After a turn of moving, he rounded the corner and found the other stolen cars. He also found two blade-wielding bandits charging out the frigging windows and attacking him, because it was a little late in the fight to be trying flanking tactics. Remy promptly ignored this threat, secure in the knowledge that his flak armour would protect him, and began lobbing firebombs at the nearest truck. Nihilus followed him, only to run smack-dab into the bandit's ace: an unsanctioned psyker with a few of the telepathy powers. The psyker amused herself for a few turns by making Nihilus stroll out of cover so that her gunners could get clear shots, while the axe-wielding bandits had much less luck breaching Remy's flak armour.\n\nSeveral turns into combat, and the melee had turned into parody. Nihilus was down to his last few wounds and was trying to climb in a window, while a chain of explosions had killed all of Remy's opponents and dropped him to -2 wounds. The rest of the party had contributed with a drive-by, suppressing the bandits that were firing on Nihilus. The remaining bandits were in a state of general retreat, two of their stolen cars racing off into the night. Only a handful of bandits still needed to flee, among them the witch. Naturally, Nihilus decided he wanted one last slobberknocker with this unsanctioned psyker before she could escape into the night. He confronts her and her autogun-toting companion on the second floor, but she beats him in initiative and throws one last Compel at him. Apparently the dice gods thought that this situation needed more drama, so the psyker triggers psychic phenomena and reverses gravity in a sixty-metre radius for ten rounds.\n\nSo there's now a spreading fire, everyone's rising into the air at a rate of three metres per round, and Nihilus has burnt his last fate point. I tell the guys outside (read, everyone but Nihilus) to make an agility check to find a way to propel themselves into the house. Everyone but Dexter makes the roll, and as a result are now inside the burning building. Nihilus kills the escort, but the witch manages to flee. Their rented car also goes crashing into the ghostfire field behind the refinery, and goes up in flames along with all their food and the weapons cache they were ferrying for the friendly local arms-dealer.\n\nAt this point, the evening is drawing to a close. We were low on time and I don't think I could have made any moment more dramatic that the fucking brushfire. So, after having run until they passed out to avoid immolation, the battered group found their way to the charred remnants of the Cathedral of Stern Hope and to the graves of their old characters. After last week, I'm worried that there may be repeats.",

Long-time lurker, first time poster. I've always loved hearing the wonderful stories posted here, be it tabletop or video games. They've always shown me there is a story and a message to tell in everything.\n\nSo I thought I should chime in. I'm from France, land of baguettes, wine, bad driving and for some reason, presidents who are nicknamed after flan brands. Here, we have this web game that's a mix between Werewolf/Mafia/Town of Salem and Space Station 13. It's kind of an obscure game because it got very little marketing, and even less out of France. So I asked a few players on the forum to tell me tales of their games so I could translate them and help give this game the recognition it deserves overseas all while reaping delicious karma.\n\nThe game's name is Mush, and it was released in 2013 in French, English and Spanish by Motion-Twin. It's playable on the studio's website, Twinoid. While the game has an English translation, it's sometimes slightly twitchy, so I've taken some liberties and decided to translate game terms straight from French (for example, the text at the start is a direct translation of the Story page from the game's web manual).\n\nThe events of Mush take place in a spaceship called the Daedalus during the 32nd century, which carries 16 crew members (and one cat). Their mission is to save humanity from the parasite which has laid waste over the Sol system, the Mush. At the start of the game, all 16 players are woken up from cryostasis by the ship's AI, NERON. Their goal is to fix the ship's main reactor, the PILGRED, find a cure to the Mush and then go back to Sol, preferably with the cure. They can also attempt to find coordinates for a new planet, EDEN, and settle there.\n\nProblem : there are 2 infiltrated mush on the ship. Their goal is to contaminate as much people as they can and eventually destroy the ship. They will also win if humans go back to Sol while at least one mush is still alive.\n\nIn Mush, games last multiple days, and every day is split in 8 cycles. Players each have an Action Point bar they use to do more or less anything and a Movement Point bar they use to move from room to room. Those points regenerate by a certain amount every cycle and can be restored through some special actions. Each playable character in the game has the choice between multiple perks he can unlock using XP.\n\nYour goal as an human is to find the mush and your goal as a mush is to not get caught. Mush can communicate through a private chat and create spores that can then be stealthily introduced to humans to contaminate them. An human needs 3 spores on themselves to become a mush. However, mush have a tendency to get dirty often, which means being dirty often will make you look suspicious. This is just a part of the game's system. Mush is a VERY dense game with a lot of complexity.\n\nNow that you've been introduced to the basics of the game, let's get to it. The player who sent me this asked to stay anonymous, and added some notes to explain how things worked to you guys. I hope you will enjoy reading about this game as much as I did reading this sub's stories.\n\n---\n\n**Prologue**\n\nToday, I shall tell you the story of one of my most stressful and probably my most exciting game as a Mush.\n\nIt was a cast game. In Mush, in a normal game, you're usually put with 15 strangers, of which you don't know the username until the end of the game. However, there are casts, which can either be compared to WoW guilds or simply a tabletop game group, depending on their size. Cast games put you with people from your cast, but you don't know who's who unless they tell you, which adds a little something when you try to recognize the people you're playing with through their speech and their play style. Casts also allow for extra options. For example, in a normal game, the number of mush and players left is shown on the HUD, so you know when someone's been contaminated, you just need to learn who and by who. In this game, however, the number of mush was hidden. Keep this in mind, as it'll matter later.\n\nCast games, due to how long they are to organize, often make you wait for more than one week to play with players we all know to be very experienced. It's important to note that this wait made crew members very exigent towards each other, and thus, on the lookout for any error they made. Add to this the fact that players in the casting often know each other quite well, which leaves a lot of opportunities for mind games, making the Mush's job significantly harder.\n\nThis difference with normal games is big and quite cruel for the players who have to play the villain in those games... which was my case.\n\n**Day 1**\n\nI woke up in the laboratory as Janice Kent, the ship's psychologist, NERON admin and trademark femme fatale who supports crew morale not only through her skills and intelligence, but also through her charm and her undeniable beauty. \n\nMy colleague as a Mush was Paola Rinaldo, the ship's officer of communications. \"Oh, no no no, this is bad, this is really bad\" resumes more or less what she was repeating over and over again in the mush channel in her panic. \n\nAfter trading a few messages, I recognized her speech pattern, and found out who it was. She was a role-player I had an habit of advising on the technical aspects of the game. I liked her and all, but it didn't really help.\n\nI always was more turned towards hunting mush than being one. I very rarely had the occasion to play the bad guy and never really asked myself the question of how to do so correctly as I much preferred blowing their faces off. I knew some things, but I really wasn't that good on this role, which still seems very hard to me today. But in comparison, I was much more fit to lead the operations than Paola, and thus we decided I would do so.\n\nThe main problem for Mush is often the anti-Mush research which quickly denies them from contamining anyone. In cast games, you pass the point of no return at an incredible speed. And so, I did my first risky decision, looking good in front of my roleplayer friend. We would steal the 2 most important items for research from the laboratory, the Mush test sample which you need to be in the laboratory to lead Mush research, and the apron which prevents actions from getting you dirty. And we would do so in front of their eyes.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note: ^^to ^^research ^^something, ^^someone ^^has ^^to ^^start ^^a ^^research ^^project ^^at ^^the ^^lab, ^^and ^^every ^^crew ^^member ^^can ^^then ^^contribute ^^their ^^AP ^^to ^^it, ^^with ^^a ^^bonus ^^if ^^you ^^have ^^the ^^Biologist ^^or ^^Doctor ^^perk. ^^You ^^need ^^to ^^be ^^clean ^^to ^^research ^^and ^^researching ^^might ^^get ^^you ^^dirty, ^^so ^^the ^^apron ^^is ^^essential.*\n\nTo do this, all we needed was to use a perk called Dialogue (no clue why) that let us erase the logs for a room once per game. Only 3 or 4 people had gotten out of the laboratory, the crime wasn't perfect but it was elaborate enough to cast doubt and not be found out.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^the ^^game ^^makes ^^every ^^player ^^start ^^in ^^the ^^laboratory ^^as ^^that's ^^where ^^the ^^cryopod ^^is ^^located, ^^and ^^the ^^game ^^usually ^^starts ^^before ^^finding ^^16 ^^players, ^^so ^^usually, ^^either ^^the ^^people ^^staying ^^in ^^the ^^lab ^^are ^^AFK ^^or ^^just ^^don't ^^know ^^where ^^else ^^to ^^go.*\n\nThus, I came out of the laboratory, while Paola entered about 15 minutes later, took both items and erased the logs without a word. We had to wait another quarter hour until we saw any reactions. One of them immediately had my attention.\n\nIt was Terrence Archer's. An old, infirm yet prodigious mechanic in a wheelchair. I need to precise that the game had now started for about 2 hours, so the people online had more than enough time to say hello, introduce their characters and start having discussions. And for that, we can thank Terrence, who created clean and pretty megathreads in the main channel for every topic : projects, research, navigation, etc... punctuated with exhaustive and pertinent advice with a small touch of humor that made his charm.\n\nOur cast was young and we all knew each other well. I had no doubts on who was behind Terrence, and I don't think anyone did : if \"classiest gentleman ever\" was a noun, you'd see the guy's picture next to it in the dictionary.\n\nBack on the topic of the reactions to Paola erasing the logs. I only mostly remember Terrence's, who literally only said the mush were \" idiots \" I barely cared about the reasons why : I took this as a declaration of war. When I'll have contaminated you, you'll think again about the value of our plan !\n\nIn the meantime, everyone else was debating whether or not they should research, taking the risk of getting dirty and thus extending the list of suspects thanks to our \"idiot\" plan. Meanwhile, I had already made 2 spores undetected while going to Dormitory Alpha to shower in secret.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^making ^^a ^^spore ^^will ^^always ^^get ^^you ^^dirty.*\n\nI must admit I wasn't always this calm that evening. It seems like I didn't leave the laboratory early enough to not be suspected. With the time it took to notice the log's disappearance, one could think I had done it before running away.\n\nWe almost got caught twice when Frieda, the thousand year old astrophysicist, asked everyone to pick up post-its to check how much things did they have in their inventory and then checked who was online through the private channel's indicators. But those two actions were, luckily for us, considered unfair by the cast moderators. The second one, slightly less, but I could argument through the fact that those indicators were very buggy. It wasn't really the case in our game, but hey, it stayed true as long as they thought it was ! Roland, our paranoid pilot, seemed to know, but he couldn't really act against the majority.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^private ^^channels ^^show ^^whether ^^the ^^people ^^in ^^them ^^are ^^online ^^or ^^not, ^^but ^^it's ^^often ^^inconsistent ^^due ^^to ^^Mush ^^being ^^a ^^web ^^game.*\n\nAfter some RP wit towards some male crew members followed by some visits to NERON to contribute to the projects thanks to my free IT points to gain people's trust, I logged off and went to sleep.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^(there ^^are ^^indeed ^^a ^^lot ^^of ^^these) ^^: ^^As ^^stated ^^earlier, ^^NERON ^^is ^^the ^^Daedalus' ^^HAL ^^9000-esque ^^ship ^^AI. ^^In ^^the ^^room ^^where ^^his ^^servers ^^and ^^BIOS ^^are ^^located, ^^you ^^can ^^choose ^^to ^^contribute ^^in ^^NERON ^^projects ^^similar ^^to ^^research ^^that ^^upgrade ^^his ^^OS. ^^Janice, ^^as ^^NERON's ^^admin ^^and ^^only ^^friend, ^^can ^^use ^^a ^^perk ^^named ^^IT ^^to ^^get ^^free ^^points ^^she ^^can ^^spend ^^to ^^contribute ^^in ^^research, ^^communication, ^^navigation ^^or ^^NERON ^^projects.*\n\n**Day 2**\n\nI don't remember when, but since then, I had spoken with Terrence in private. \"Those erased logs are worrying me, I want to know what you think...\", I said, along with a bunch of smileys for the teenage girl effect. Everyone likes the pretty woman who gives you free moral. It's easy when you can play around with people's mind with roleplay.\n\nTerrence ended up revealing his list of mush suspects. We were relatively far down in the list. Paola thought she was the only one Terrence suspected, and was quite relieved when I told her, for good reason. As of me, I must have really went far down in his list since he let me push his wheelchair around whenever I asked.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^since ^^Terrence ^^is ^^an ^^infirm, ^^he's ^^stuck ^^in ^^a ^^wheelchair, ^^so ^^he ^^has ^^to ^^pay ^^twice ^^more ^^MP ^^to ^^move ^^between ^^rooms, ^^but ^^can ^^move ^^freely ^^if ^^someone ^^pushes ^^him ^^(read ^^: ^^if ^^someone's ^^in ^^the ^^room ^^when ^^he's ^^leaving)*\n\nWe didn't see time pass that day, as we moved around the ship a ton. I got to help him build a sofa for Paola and work on one of his helper drones. We talked about a thousand things in private which I can't remember in detail, but what I do remember is that we had tons of fun, that's for sure.\n\n^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^Paola ^^almost ^^never ^^leaves ^^the ^^bridge ^^as ^^she ^^has ^^to ^^work ^^on ^^establishing ^^communications ^^with ^^rebel ^^bases, ^^which ^^takes ^^up ^^all ^^her ^^AP ^^and ^^time. ^^The ^^sofa ^^works ^^like ^^a ^^bed ^^and ^^gives ^^more ^^AP/MP ^^by ^^cycle ^^to ^^the ^^person ^^resting ^^on ^^it ^^between ^^cycles, ^^but ^^you ^^can ^^place ^^it ^^anywhere ^^and ^^cannot ^^move ^^it ^^after ^^doing ^^so, ^^so ^^it's ^^usually ^^put ^^on ^^the ^^bridge ^^so ^^Paola ^^can ^^use ^^it.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, I had already put 2 spores on Terrence. Only one until he becomes one of us. Paola was ecstatic. I told her to keep it on the down low and that I'd take care of contamination. Yes, trying to look cool again. But it was also more cautions, as her position meant running off into the ship for no reason or getting dirty would instantly make her a big suspect.\n\n&gt; - Yay, you're so good ! Tomorrow, he'll be one of us, and he has no idea!\n\n&gt; - Yeah, we're so close :) Though, tomorrow, I won't be here for most of the day, so I hope I won't get caught like an idiot.\n\nThis was the point where I should have shut my mouth.\n\nSince I had no reason to push his wheelchair anymore as I had used all my daily spores, I pushed him up to the refectory, and said I'd leave him here as I was out of energy. \n\nThat's where things go down the drain : he invites me like the gentleman he was to dine with him, so I'd get back the MP I needed to go back. I was absolutely screwed, since Mush do not gain MP or AP back when eating...\n\nAfter 2 minutes of thinking, I decide to simply run off without an answer, going back to the dormitory,  pretending not to have noticed his message before leaving the room. Maybe I should have accepted his invitation then fell asleep in the refectory pretending to be AFK. It would probably have raised some eyebrows, but at least, it'd be less dubious than this !\n\nAnd I knew I had become the n°1 suspect.\n\n**Day 3**\n\nI woke up much earlier than everyone. I wanted to do my daily tasks as I wouldn't be here for most of the day. Also, I thought there was a big chance I'd find Janice dead when I'd log back on. I knew I had clearly revealed myself as a Mush, all because of this damn 'shroom metabolism. I hadto find a way to cover myself before it was too late.\n\nSo, I cooked up a plan (pun intended). Mush have their own separate perk tree, and one of those perks is Phagocytosis, which lets you eat one of your own spores. I would eat a spore and pretend I had indeed regained energy from eating normal human food.\n\nAnd so I did, all while giving excuses and a completely convoluted, terribly long explanation to Terrence explaining that \"no no, look, I'm not a mush ! I'm eating, haha!\". In my panic, I didn't realize how bad it looked. On this final note, I logged off until the evening, which came very quickly.\n\nI was happy to learn Janice was still alive and well. That's one good thing. I asked Terrence what I missed, to which he answered \"Not much, not as fun when you're not here.\" We discussed for a bit, and then he logged off.\n\nI then noticed something : we were already quite far in research, despite the disappearance of the apron. I had just realized they were about to complete the Mycoscan, a device that lets humans know how much spores are on them. Not good for me : if Terrence used it, he'd know right away it was me who contaminated him twice. I prayed for them not to complete it until I could put one more spore on Terrence, but there was no point. RNGesus was with them and they didn't get dirty at all completing the Mycoscan.\n\n*^^Translator's ^^note ^^: ^^mush ^^are ^^shown ^^with ^^0 ^^spores ^^when ^^scanned.*\n\nIn this moment, I never was more stressed and doubtful. This time, I'd be dead if I didn't do something. I thought of contaminating him while he was going to the laboratory, maybe while pushing his wheelchair... no. If I logged off and Terrence logged on after midnight to get scanned, I wouldn't be able to do anything. Also, he probably wouldn't want me to push him this time. I also needed time to make a spore properly. Clearly, too risky.\n\nI had no choice. He had to become a mush this evening. In both cases, I'd die. But in this case, Paola would still have a teammate, and a good one with that!\n\nAnd so, I went kamikaze. \n\nI entered the dormitory, removed the camera and infected him one last time.\n\n10 minutes later, someone else in the dormitory planted their knife in my chest.\n\nI fell.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWelp, it was over for me. I placed every hope I had into Terrence, even though in hindsight, I had left my new teammate in a difficult situation. The cast's forum was going wild. Since we had disabled the indicator for the number of mush left, we didn't know for sure whether Terrence had become a mush. I suppose they suspected him greatly, but at least, they didn't kill him.\n\nOne big thing the mush have is a perk named Transfer that lets them switch characters with a human player they've infected once. The next day, Paola became Raluca, the asocial physician who developed NERON, and Terrence became Commander Jin Su, but not before completing the restoration of the PILGRED. And thus, he decided to trigger the return to Sol, giving the victory to the mush. He had done the right choice, as expected from him. People complained about that thing he has with ending games without letting anyone do anything, especially in cast games, but it was nevertheless a good play.\n\nPeople were annoyed that I chose to pick this option, but I still believe it was the only one I had. In the end, I found out I was already a suspect for a long while for different reasons, some more true than others. But Paola was very happy and Terrence complimented me on my cleverness, so I think I did well. And we all had fun, in the end !\n\n*FIN*\n\n---\n\nSo, there you go. I did my first post. Hurray!\n\nI recommend anyone interested in game tales and this type of game to try out Mush. While it is a complex and often unpractical game, it's terribly captivating when you get into it. Every character has an interesting lore and personality that makes them perfect for roleplay and very likeable and memorable. Mush takes a direction in the \"role game\" genre that has rarely been seen before, and it's executed perfectly.\n\nI might post more of these if I get sent more. For now, I hope I got your attention. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "When I GM I tend to be pretty lenient about what the players can and cannot do.  If a player wants to do something that will make the game more enjoyable for them, I am happy to sit down and see how I can make that happen.  If there's no mechanic for it, but I can reasonably manufacture one, I will provided it doesn't break the game.\n\nThis is a story of my acquiescence getting perhaps a bit far out of hand.\n\nI had a player (player 1) who was sort of a package deal with another player (player 2).  The player that he was attached to was a valued member of the group, but for reasons that are best left unexplained, player 2 needed player 1 around so that she could play.  So I explained the concepts of the game to player 1 and helped him with character creation.  He wound up having a human fighter named Squirky Jimbers.  When I explained starting wealth and that he could spend it on things he liked, he announced, suddenly:\n\n\"I'd like a chicken farm.\"\n\nI was somewhat taken aback.\n\n\"A chicken farm.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nHe shoved over the book he was perusing.\n\n\"See? Chickens, two copper.  So I can afford... three hundred chickens with my spare gold and sell the eggs.  They can free range off of half an acre, so they shouldn't need to be given feed.\"\n\nI told him to let me make some spreadsheets and get back to him.  Chickens were, indeed, listed at 2 copper apiece.  But there was no price listed for an egg.  So I clumsily took the price of eggs today versus the price of chickens today and compared them to the established prices of chickens in game to conclude that two dozen eggs would be good for about a copper.  Three hundred chickens lay three hundred eggs per day, yielding about 12.5 copper's worth of eggs per day.  That provided a Return on Investment of about 2.1%.  I was fine with that.  I added that he would need a servant to care for the chickens and sell the eggs (one copper per day) which further cut into his margins.  He also had to kick back another gold to provide for the land and shelter for the chickens.  He accepted these terms.  His small chicken farm was going to be based in the small (about 100 residents), made up village of Vandil which resided on the main river in my made up world.  This last part would turn out to be key to his plans.\n\nAnd the campaign went on.  He made a little copper on the side (though I noticed he was taking less than the 11.5 copper per day he was allotted I didn't really pay mind to it; I assumed he was deducting expenses form it).  That was until the 21st day had passed at which point he informed me that his first clutch of eggs was hatching into chicks. He had been taking half income because half of the eggs laid were being sat upon to hatch, while he ensured that it was never enough for a hen to be sitting on a dozen eggs (at which point she would stop laying according to the rules).\n\nAll this time, while the party was negotiating and clearing dungeons, engaging in all sorts of skullduggery in the campaign that I had spent months creating, he had been making sure his chicken farm was meticulously managed in his absence.  He had even specifically said, multiple times, while camping that he was writing instruction to his loyal farm hands for the upkeep of the chicken farm.\n\nBut this was the first I had heard of these chicks.  I open my rule book.  Sure enough, black and white, eggs can be eaten or sold or sat upon to be hatched into chicks after 21 days.  These chicks would mature and begin laying in approximately 100 days.  His investment had just gone from having an ROI of perhaps 1-something% to a considerably higher ROI.  I quickly set about nerfing.\n\nHe would have to hire another laborer; an additional one per every 300 additional live chickens, regardless of whether or not they were productive (so he'd have to hire a laborer for chicks).  And what's more, he had to fork over another gold piece to build an expansion for his hen house and buy a bit more land from a neighbor.  I also made a note that his chickens would have to die at an appropriate time.  I created an excel spreadsheet explicitly for tracking his chicken births and deaths.  Truth be told, I was impressed and... well, I really do like spreadsheets.  I believed that I had quelled this farm uprising and we could refocus on the campaign.  He even showed signs of being interested in the adventures at hand until, one day, after killing a cultist, he announced that he was leaving the party.\n\nWhy, you might ask?  Oh, only a temporary matter, but his farm has been far too long in his absence.  He needed to go back, get the lay of the land, and see if there might be any business opportunities.  And he was off on his horse.  At this point, his chicken farm consisted of two separate buildings (a laying area and a hatchery/nursery) and possessed three thousand chickens as well as eleven laborers and an overseer (which I had made him hire to supervise the now extensive team of laborers) to attend to them.  He was making about a hundred and ten copper per day in profit, but had also amassed a decent sum of wealth from spelunking.\n\nAfter the session, I quickly threw together names and faces for him to meet in Vandil.  His foreman was a named character, his neighbors.  I even threw together a plot on the part of one of his neighbors who owned the forest surrounding his property and logged it.  His neighbor was sick of the chickens as well as their smell and was trying to frame him to force him out of the town.  The idea was for him to use diplomacy, for a change, and prove to the town lawmen that his neighbor was full of shit.\n\nHe *did* use diplomacy.  To convince his laborers and foremen to join him in a posse and murder the fuck out of his neighbors.  I had not seen that coming.  In fact, he was so convincing (and lucky) that his diplomacy roll drew the attention of the gods.  *So* convincing was he that the wives and sons of his laborers decided to make the blood bath a family affair and join in on the fun.  After all, they needed to make a living.  And that is how a mob of thirty people assembled, barricaded his neighbors' family in their home, lit the house on fire, and proceeded to burn the entire forest down in in an event that was then successfully pinned on a forest fire due to another excellent roll by the Squirky and the accurate assessment that the vast majority of evidence would have been destroyed in the fire that claimed his neighbors' lives.  And his laborers certainly weren't going to testify against themselves.  And besides, how dare the local magistrates sling such vile accusations at a reputable, upstanding gentleman farmer, patriarch of Vandil, and his loyal employees who were guilty of nothing more than trying to put out a fire that had unfortunately claimed the lives of his beloved neighbors.\n\nBut he didn't stop there.  He and his employees swore up and down that as his neighbor perished in the flames, his dying words were that his truest friend and attempted savior, Squirky Jimbers, should inherit his property.  With a name like Squirky Jimbers, how could you not trust him?\n\nThat did not fly.  No, the neighbors' relative from the nearest city (Caldia) would inherit.  He would likely arrive within a week or so.  Word had already been sent for him.  Squirky Jimbers waited.  Like a spider in a web surrounded by thousands and thousands of chickens.  Soon, the heir arrived.  He was devastated by the loss of his uncle and the property he had played on as a child.\n\nSquirky Jimbers assured him that he had known his uncle well and that his uncle was a wonderful man.  He was sure to use the phrase \"The candle that burns twice as bright\" multiple times.  Lovely.  But a man from the town couldn't be tied down with a property that was now almost worthless!  Squirky couldn't allow that.  So he generously offered to take the land off his hands for a princely sum of fifty gold coins.  I figured what was the harm?  The forest was burned down.  He'll just put more chickens on the land.  I allowed the heir to agree.  He publicly signed over the land, accepted the money, and was on his way on a donkey that Squirky Jimbers had generously provided as well as a bushel of hard boiled eggs for the road.  That set him back eight gold pieces.\n\nHowever, the poison that Squirky Jimbers fed to the donkey beforehand had only cost a few silver.  That night, Squirky (with the benefit of his horse) caught up to the heir on the road back to the city, stranded with a very dead donkey, and promptly murdered him, taking back the fifty gold pieces (and eggs) he had given him.  Stab the donkey.  Damn bandits, the local lord should really do a better job policing this road!  Squirky was never one to let money go to waste.  And those charred remains of a forest were much easier to clear now and make way for the barley and cows that Squirky was putting in.  I hurriedly forced him to hire more laborers.  This time, more expensive ones.  Dairy workers, farmers.  Two more overseers.  But, using in game prices and extrapolating the rest, he was still able to turn a profit fair and square.  After he had established his new enterprises on his ill-gotten land, he hurriedly rejoined his party who had just finished clearing out a diabolist cult from a ruined palace.\n\nHe apologized for the absence, but he brought them... a bushel of day old hard boiled eggs.  *Lovely*.  This continued for another large chunk of the campaign.  He was beginning to really get into his character.  His actions in Vandil had really brought out the lawful evil in him and he was really coming into his own.  His barley, cows, and chickens multiplied until one day I informed him that his production had exceeded the markets that were within a few day's walk.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Okay, I buy a boat, then.\" and started scribbling on his character sheet.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"I buy a boat.  A keelboat.  Three thousand gold.  It can't travel quickly, but the river is a more direct route to both nearby cities than the roads and it can travel with the river at night when someone on the road would have to rest.  Vandil already has a dock.\"\n\nSure enough.  That was all above board.  You can buy a boat in Dungeons and Dragons.  He hired multiple sailors and even a captain to staff his keelboat, employed by the \"Jimbers Produce Company\" (which he had named his enterprise the previous sessions), and christened \"S.S. Flappy\". He now had more than enough capacity to transport his growing produce to numerous cities.  His company motto was \"With a Name Like Jimbers, You Know You Can Trust Us\".  He even entertained trying to go back to Vandil to be on the S.S. Flappy's maiden voyage to Caldia.\n\nAs it happened, the quest that the heroes were following led them to Candia.  Someone with a name you can trust suggested that they hitch a ride on his keelboat from Vandil, which was not out of their way.  This met with wholehearted agreement.  I decided to have a little fun and put his enterprise in jeopardy.  A local lord (a character which had already existed, by the way) by the name of Walder Curnbrook was going to attack Vandil.  He didn't like chickens.  Our heroes sprung into action and hurried at break neck pace to Vandil.  I realized, the session before they'd arrive, that Vandil would look completely different from the last time we saw it.  The employees in the service of the Jimbers Produce Company now outnumbered the original citizens of Vandil.  The town would have at least quadrupled in size with Squirky Jimbers employing at least one of every four citizens.  It now had a bustling river port.  The sheer new scale of Vandil blew our party away, and me a bit.\n\nWord has already spread of Lord Curnbrook's attack.  Citizens are scurrying about with no direction, some preparing a defense, some hunkering down, some fleeing by land or (preferably) by water.  When Squirky Jimbers announces himself, they are relieved to see their presumable savior.  The same Squirky Jimbers who organized a fire brigade to try and save his doomed neighbors.  He and the party calm them, assure them that they can easily repel Lord Curnbrook's army if they band together.  An emergency election is held, at the insistence of a reputable local chicken farmer and his employees, and Squirky Jimbers is overwhelmingly elected mayor.\n\nDefenses begin to take shape.  Barricades are assembled.  Defensive strong points are concentrated around... you guessed it, the Jimbers Produce Company's farms.  The JPC's keelboat is put on the river with a ballista and archers, both of which this town now has because it is now quite large.  There is no bridge across the river, but multiple places where it can be forded.\n\nLord Curnbrook attacks one day early.  Inspiring words from Mayor Jimbers combined with outflanking the Lord's forces with the use of the keelboat to land troops behind him lead inevitably to Curnbrook's defeat.  He and his troops are caught in a bend in the river, however, and cannot flee except by going across the river.  There's no ford there, though.  Many of them drown.  The rest are slowed enough that even the ridiculously slow keelboat can catch up with them and have its archers gun them down in the water.  It is a massacre.\n\nLord Curnbrook falls to his knees before his mighty vanquisher, protector of the common man: Squirky Jimbers.  Anything for his life.  Squirky Jimbers demands the hand of his daughter in marriage to which Curnbrook hastily agrees.  Literally the second that Curnbrook takes Jimbers and his host back to his ancestral castle, Mayor Jimbers orders his followers to attack without mercy and claims the castle and surrounding lands as Vandil's, but mostly his.  Lord Curnbrook is executed for a litany of crimes, the foremost of which was failing to properly patrol the countryside and allowing the poor nephew of Jimbers' beloved neighbor to be murdered.  Nice touch.\n\nFar from being bored with this turn of events, the rest of the party have completely forgotten about their previous quest and have gotten caught up in the story of Squirky Jimbers and helping him consolidate his temporal power.  They receive titles and tracts of land to govern and farm from the benevolent Squirky Jimbers who now styles himself Lord-Mayor of Vandil and Curnbrook.  I figure if the party is having fun, I should play along and not resist.  So I humor them and force them to defend their claims in the local courts as well as the battlefield.  As bad as I feel for abandoning all of my plots that I worked so hard on towards the end, they genuinely enjoyed themselves.  And Squirky Jimbers, the chicken lord, went down in history as the greatest, if not the most honorable, feudal lord in the land.",

        "text": "Our actors for this mini-campaign:  \n***Charlie Lockwood***, a young teenage girl who is stuck watching her four younger brothers because her parents are high-ranking execs and are rarely around to deal with them.   \n\n***Annabelle Boudoir***, a somewhat preppy daddy’s girl who had recently moved from Texas, where her father had owned a lucrative oil contract and made some good money.\n  \n***Raj Mulligan***, born in India and quickly finding himself in the United States of America after birth, Raj is still a ‘fish out of water’ compared to his other friends.  \n\n***JD Callahan***, the local ‘tough guy bully’ that really only picks on the younger kids he can threaten, but is generally harmless overall. Lives across from Charlie.\n***\n\nIt is February 6th, 1978. The Eastern seaboard has been wracked by a [terrible storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_blizzard_of_1978) which came with such fierce abandon nobody could plan or prepare. President Jimmy Carter has announced a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were mobilized by the governor to help restore balance and order, as well as bring vital aid to the region. In Abington Massachusetts everything is still, covered under a blanket of falling snow. With the roads out of order, there is no school or work to attend to, and many turn to the simple joys of playing outside.\n\nWe find our gang gathered at the Lockwood house. Charlie is trying to control her younger siblings, who demand to go outside and play. The rest have gathered at the front steps, dressed in their best snow gear. Annabelle carries herself well with designer this and that, and poor Raj is still a bit behind with a double-layer of sweatshirts. JD has taken up position on the couch as the younger Lockwoods engage in general roughhousing, much to the chagrin of their older sister. The four high school freshman are discussing what is going to be done on their day off, and Raj suggests a game of D&amp;D, this new ‘interactive board game’ that has been making a rise recently. The gang decides that while it may sound fun, everyone wants to go outside and sled in the backyard. The four little ones are ready to go when some neighborhood kids walk by, suggesting an even better sledding location at an abandoned construction site just down the road. The snow has buried the fence and a bunch of kids are using the gulleys and dips from the heavy machinery to good effect in the powdery mix. Despite the inherent dangers, Charlie decides that she’ll let her brothers go since she’ll be there with them. Everyone suits up and heads down the snow-choked road, Raj complaining about wanting to stay inside.\n\nThe gang reach the site, where dozens of kids have already gathered. The thick layer of snow makes it easy to skirt the metal wire fence and enter the site. Gangly iron beams stretch out from the white blankets that cover the foundation and trenches, the superstructure left to the elements before the storm hits. Charlie lets her brothers run off to go play with some friends, and JD starts to terrorize them with snowballs. Raj sits down to build a snowman, and the girls just relax and talk. JD attempts to harass a local kid running by with a sled, but when he stretches his leg out to trip him, the heel of his boot slips across the hard packed snow and he tumbles down the hill. All of the kids laugh at him, and in an embarrassed rage he grabs and attempts to pants a young local named Jimmy. Only succeeding in getting the snow pants, poor Jimmy shuffles a yard or so before collapsing in the snow, which suddenly opens up beneath him as he vanishes from sight.\n\nAs some of the oldest around, Charlie and Annabelle rush into action as JD throws himself into the hole, but it’s too big. He can just barely reach Jimmy’s hand. The snow seemed to have opened up into some tunnel, the smooth dry surface cold to the touch. Jimmy is crying lightly, saying his foot really hurt. The two girls pull JD out of the way and Charlie pulls Jimmy free, and it’s clear he sprained his ankle. As a show of faith and a little shame at his actions, JD makes him a splint and ‘sets’ his leg as a placebo. Jimmy is thankful, but wants to go home before his parents found out he hurt himself, or he’d never be let back outside. He trudges off towards his house.\n\nAfter the excitement dies down, the Lockwood Four ask their older sister if they can borrow Jimmy’s sled, which he left behind. She agrees as long as they get it back, but they soon show up without it. They admit that one of them broke it, and they threw it down the hole to hide the evidence. She sends them home immediately, and the four sullen little kids trudge by Raj’s snowman as JD rushes into it, scattering the white powder everywhere. Realizing she can’t trust them alone Charlie races after her brothers, and the gang slowly filters to their homes. Raj realizes that he left his D&amp;D box set at the Lockwood place, but gets turned around in the snow. Annabelle reaches home and realizes that she didn’t see Raj make it back, and worries about him. She finds her father in the garage working on his plow truck, and asks if he can help. He decides to trust her with the snowmobile because her friend may be in danger, but wants her back in two hours. She thanks him and takes it out, quickly finding the frozen Raj still walking the streets. Giving him her gloves, the two head back to the Lockwood place so Raj can get his box.\n\nAs the race down the road a large looming mass suddenly appears, the two of them bathed in bright light. Annabelle swerves to the left to avoid the large armored personnel carrier, and Raj is tossed into a snowbank. After Raj pulls himself out the APC commander pops from his hatch, reprimanding the kids for being out in the current weather. Annabelle sasses the man, who demands they get home. The National Guard is patrolling the neighborhoods in their armored vehicles, the thick treads easily traversing the snow. He locks everything up and issues them on their way again, and they reach the Lockwood house without anymore problems. Everyone is reunited as Charlie tries to serve her brothers dinner, mac n cheese for the little guys. Raj sits everyone down and explains the rules to D&amp;D, and they quickly make their characters. Charlie plays Brunhilda the Magic-User, Annabelle goes with Frieda the Thief, and JD chooses to play Traje the Elf. Raj spins a gripping tale where the adventuring party must find a lost bard friend who was abducted by vampires. But during the climax, it is revealed that the bard was a vampiric lord the whole time, forging his own death to escape the talons of justice. Traje is carried off by acolytes as Brunhilda and Frieda fall back from the dark depths of the dungeon…\n\nWith the cliffhanger set, Annabelle realizes that she’s overstayed her welcome and her father is going to be furious with her for being late. Though she is a bit put off because Raj never thanked her for the ride, she has some feelings for him and decides to drop him off that night. Her father is waiting, but seems to be the forgiving sort, sending her off to bed with a warning (and revoking her use of the snowmobile for a while). Charlie sends her brothers to bed, which is an adventure in itself, and everyone rests easy for the night.\n\nNow it is February 7th, 1978. The snow has stopped falling and a chill falls over the region. The first one to wake is JD, who is horrified to find that though his eyes are open, he can see nothing! His skin is cold to the touch, and in a panic he runs into his bedroom wall. As the pain throbs through his head, a voice whispers to him, and by the time the pain fades he can see again. Disturbed by this, he wakes up and rushes across the street to see Charlie, who is making breakfast for her already hyperactive brothers. They demand another day of fun in the snow, but she warns them that they’re still in trouble for breaking the sled, and need to clean their room. JD arrives and explains his vision in a very rushed and confusing way, not getting things across.\n\nA few blocks away Annabelle arrives at Raj’s doorstep, asking if he’d be interested in hanging out. Rather oblivious to the hints and facts his friend is throwing at him, he only wishes to get back into the D&amp;D game and carry on the storyline. Frustrated with him, they walk in silence to the Lockwood house, where JD has finished his story. The young boys are tearing it up demanding to go outside, and JD eggs them on. The general chaos of it all is interrupted by a knock at the door. Annabelle opens it and finds a police officer who asks to speak to whoever was in charge of the household at the time. Still a bit sassy, she demands to know what’s going on. The officer holds a picture of Jimmy Harrison, who went missing. Annabelle breaks down into tears, having babysit Jimmy for many years. Charlie is equally distraught, Jimmy being friends with her brothers. Raj distracts the young ones from the distressing news by offering them the spot of ‘four kobolds’ in his D&amp;D game. The gang tell the officer everything they know, about the construction site and his injury. They offer to show him this all, and everyone gets bundled up. When they demand to know what’s going on, JD tells the Lockwood Four that they’re going on a monster hunt, and the boys are suitably excited, brandishing cap guns and play swords for the 'fight'.\n\nThe construction site is empty today, and the officer examines the hole. The gang offer to join the search parties combing the streets for Jimmy, and the cop heads off to the join the rest of the group. Annabelle is laser-focused, feeling like some of it is her fault, and manages to spot a glove in a snowbank. It’s one of Jimmy’s fingerless ‘cool guy’ gloves, and its mate isn’t far. After finding it they finish the rest of the search without note. A National Guard truck passes and they try to get a ride, but the soldiers tell them off. Annabelle has a secret wonder if the NG has something to do with the disappearance. If they had almost gotten hit by the APC, could something have happened with Jimmy? With the new evidence in hand they reach the Harrison house where everyone is gathered, and offer it to the K9 hound brought in. The dog sniffs it, and starts to take off on a trail. The gang, the cop, and several volunteers all follow in pursuit, hiding the dark ideas of Jimmy’s fate in their minds, hoping for the best...",

        "text": "x-post w/ r/dndgreentext\n\n\nI'm the DM of this homebrewed world. The PCs are in a land caught between two war fronts in the east and west. To the east an army of imperialistic scum. To the west, a place where nature is literally the enemy, from the bugs to the trees. This western place, The Etryptian Wilds, has a line of forts established across it that take advantage of the semi-predictable behavior of the hordes of monsters that occasionally swell out of this land. Enter the players, who have just cracked open psionics globally. The Rogue, Ralathon, is the only player in the game (and one of the few players I'd met at the time) to not have an orphan for a character. In fact, his life has been spent sort of trying to prove to his dad that he's a pretty cool guy after running away.\n\nHe receives a pigeon with a letter from the younger sister he has just learned he has: Father has disappeared into the Wilds, Mother has taken ill, and I am trying to convince the man in charge of this fort to send a party out to help our village. Ralathon and the party decide that instead of immediately answering this call, they will stay in town. Hijinks ensue, followed shortly by a terrible storm that delays them further and ultimately kills the cleric and nearly breaks the sorcerer's back. The fighter is relatively unscathed. Ralathon is, in typical rogue fashion, fine.\n\nAfter the storm, Ralathon and party leave the city they're in and make way to the Etryptian Wall, where they will begin moving north til they reach his sister. They arrive at a fort, engage in a short battle with some Wildebeasts, and meet a familiar face: Joheshan the Smith, a man whom they met (and who identified the magical (and cursed) armor the fighter now wears) in the city. This man does not recognize them. They spend the night in the fort, as travelling overnight near the Wilds is dangerous. Early in the morning, Joheshan comes knocking at Ralathon's bedchamber. His skin is white (for reference, the dude is very much a black man), his eyes shot with blood and his breathing labored and heaving. He relates to him over the course of several breaths and through pained sobs how he watched Ralathon's sister die just a few hours ago during an attack on the fort she was in. Freaking out, Ralathon gathers the party to head north to this fort where they find the Wilds has swallowed the land almost to the walls, and in which a number of trees common to the Wilds are grown. He leads the party to the village, and finds homes completely overgrown, and piles of clothing and bones from which trees grow thick and plentiful. The home where his mother rested in her illness has a tree sprouting from the bedroom.\n\ntl;dr: Player makes non-orphan D&amp;D character, decides not to run to save family, I turn family into trees.",

        "text": "So, I'm playing some Magic Duels online. I was taking a few newly made decks for a spin, and I thought I'd play some ranked matches. I had made a red black vampires deck quite a while ago which I wanted to give a go. \n\nI enter the game and I start with a somewhat risky hand, five land and two creatures. I decide to go with it as the creatures were both two mana and decently strong. \n\nThe game opens up standardly enough, my opponent playing an ally deck with some supporting creatures. \n\nThe first few turns were me loosing most of my low-cost creatures to removal. Though he was effectively wasting that removal on low-cost creatures, it still put me rather far behind. \n\nThankfully I managed to pull the game back. I got a few nice vampires out. I was attacking quite aggressively, and lost a few creatures in the process, but had managed to slap his life count down and kill quite a few of his creatures. I made sure to trade for at least one of his creatures in each combat when I could so I made sure that he didn't get bonuses for having allies. \n\nEventually, we got to the point where he was down to three life. While this was great, unfortunately he had better creatures than I. Though he hadn't taken a swing at me, any attack on him would get all my creatures killed and set me back to the point where victory would be nearly impossible. I had no cards in hand at all, and I had not packed this deck with many individually big creatures or removal. \n\nIt was at this point that he plops down an expensive creature, tapping all his land to do so, a 6/6 with flying. At this point I was practically dead. \n\nHe passes the turn. I pause for a moment, considering the situation and the possibilities. Then I suddenly attack with everything. \n\nWhy would I do that? Had sanity deserted me? Was this a desperate attempt to take down as many creatures with me? \n\nAllow me to rewind slightly and explain. You see, the creature my opponent had put down was called Kothophed, Soul Hoarder. This creature, besides being a big beater with evasion also has a line of ability text that reads: \n\n\"Whenever a permanent owned by another player is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you draw a card and you lose 1 life.\" \n\nMy opponent had three life left and each of my creatures had more than three strength, so if a single one was not blocked then my opponent would loose the game, regardless of his superior board state. \n\nOn the other hand, though my opponent had enough creatures to block mine and avoid taking combat damage himself, if he blocked my creatures each would certainly die. And if they die, they enter the graveyard. If they enter the graveyard, he loses 1 life. \n\nSo his options were as follows:\n1. Take the damage, lose more than 3 life and die\n2. Block some of my creatures, letting the others go, and losing life not only from combat damage but Kothophed's ability too as the dead creatures from combat enter the graveyard and then die\n3. Block all of my creatures, loose 4 life and die\n4. Concede the match... and die. \n\nThere was a pause when I issued the attack. I couldn't see his face, but I would have given my best EDH deck to see his face as he makes the choice. \n\nHe experimented with different blocking combinations, switching around and seemingly testing each outcome in his mind. In the end he goes for option three, Kotophed kills him as soon as my creatures enter the graveyard. \n\nMoments like that are the reason why I play magic.\n\nTL:DR Version:\n- Played vampires\n- Got in a tight spot\n- Force my enemy to choose between killing themselves and letting me kill them because of a card effect on one of his creatures which forces him to lose life every time I lose a creature. \n- Watch him commit magical suicide. \n- Gain a new appreciation for the game.

Both characters as masterfully played in character and are a joy to see interacting with each other. Galduhr has a sweet spot for Rayne, Ava and Kreagon are besties. Shanan is a bit of a coward, but well liked by all.\n\n*Back to the campaign*\n\n\nA disturbing chant echos around certain parts of the lower floors within the Death House, and our adventurers fear its presence. After exploring and dealing with various other sections of the cursed house our party finally sets out to follow the disturbing chanting to its source and put an end to it. Nestled in the bowels of the earth our party finds a decrepit chamber filled with rotting corpses chained into alcoves. Here the chanting drones on from behind the walls louder and in all directions. The chamber is seemingly a dead end. The walls are searched for hidden passages, Ava fails to spot any such devices, but Shanan and Kraegon are more fortunate and discover a crease in one of the walls allowing dust to filter through. Even with the help of Ava's crowbar, Kraegon fails to open up the crevice. Aiming to equally embarrass his rival he invites Galduhr to give it a shot. Natural 20. Galduhr stands against the wall grinning at Kraegon while he effortlessly pushed the door open with one hand. \n\nLight spills into the next room revealing a sacrificial alter on a raised platform surrounded by water. The chanting stops. Finally there is silence within the Death House. Miffed but undeterred Kraegon enters the room followed by the rest of the party. Galduhr never the one to use much sense leaps off the raised outer platform and makes for the alter at the center of the room, the water comes up to his armpits. Kraegon follows swiftly. Shortly after the last of the party enters the room black spectral shades emerge from nowhere, seemingly dozens of them. They surround the entire room unmoving.\n\nThe chanting returns, clear, crisp from all around us:\n\n*\"One must die. One must die. One must die.\"*  \n\nAva, Shanan and Rayne remain on the outer platform, Rayne to the North, Ava and Shanan to the south. Kraegon and Galduhr stand on the steps of the alter, well above the waterline. Weapons are readied, eyes dart back and forth, nobody moves. Galduhr is the first to act, attempting to destroy the single shade floating above the alter with his warpick. His well placed swing goes right through the floating shade. No reaction from the other creatures, no initiative. Galduhr is now thoroughly out of his element.\n\n*\"One must die. One must die. One must die.\"*  The chanting continues. \n\nLooks are cast about, dread seeping into us all. Spells are cast to try to determine what surrounds us to no avail. Shanan attempts to pass through a shade coincidentally blocking his way toward the alter, he is able to with no obvious ill effect. Ava scouts ahead, south of the alter sits a ominous looking pile of bones and bits, to the north is a portcullis blocking a small pool situated below a chute that leads to a previous room. Back at the alter plans are beginning to be hatched. \"One must die\" they are chanting and so the party breaks into puzzle solving mode. Sideways glances are halted temporally as the party works together lest anyone get any crazy ideas. Can a bug be killed upon the alter? No effect, perhaps a summoned mage hand? No, does a bit of cloth from a kiddnapped local work? Definitely not. Why are we even here again? The party minus Rayne stands about the alter, thinking of possibilities. Ava steps back into the water and the chant stops again. \n\nA new dreadful chorus fills the room:\n\n\n\"Lorgoth the Decayer, We awaken Thee.\"\n\nA rumbling begins to send ripples across the water. The chanting continues as actions are readied. Faces are set hard to stare down whatever horror awaits. Galduhr in true Ash Ketchum style, switches his pirate eyepatch to the other side. 30 feet south of the alter the pile of bones and bits begin to rise. Out of the muck stands a many armed twisted creature of filth and flesh, death and decay. Must be \"Lorgoth the Decayer,\" the chanting stops. Galduhr's handaxe flies first, followed closely by Rayne's Magic Missile. The attacks slam into the monstrous mass to little effect. Lorgoth the Decayer morphs and writhes into a twisting column, and then slams into the waist deep water. Kraegon and Ava are sent flying backwards as a wave surges outward in every direction. Shanan manages keep his feet. Rayne and Galduhr are safe from the wave at the outer platform and the top of the alter steps respectively. \n\nKraegon pulls himself out of the water and rushes Lorgoth with his greatsword, he cleaves a mighty chunk from the beast but it doesn't seem effected. Shield of Faith is cast, and Kraegon steels himself against the monstrosity. Ava fires an arrow into the back of the beast, and then proceeds to wave and curse at it in distraction while Rayne takes aim with her crossbow. Her bolt is deflected. Galduhr, thrilled to be back in his element swings his mighty warpick successfully gouging another chuck out of it decayed mass. \n\nAgain Lorgoth the Decayer morphs and writhes into a twisting column, and then slams into the waist deep water. Ava, Galduhr and Kraegon are swept away in the tide. Still standing, Shanan is then met with a massive bludgeoning attack seeing his health similarly wiped away like the rest of us. Lorgoth's massive writing form now stands next to Rayne and Shanan, they have nowhere to run. Kraegon rushes to heal Shanan, Lay on Hands to the rescue. Ava reaches into her bag and tosses a handful of ball bearing into the water beneath the creature, the creature's many writing limbs find little difficulty in navigating them. Rayne unleashes her Ray of Frost, 1 damage, grimly she attempts to flee. Lorgoth's opportunity attack bludgeons her for high damage. With each turn Kraegon and Galduhr continue their assault to hack at the monster, and with each turn the monstrosity sends people flying and smacks them around for massive damage. Ava tries to raise the portcullis and lure the beast under them. Rayne catches onto Ava's plan and attempts to join her. Rayne goes down, knocked out face down in the water. Shanan is critically wounded in the next attack, dying on the raised platform around the outside of the room. Kraegon is dropping health rapidly, Lorgoth shows little sign of going down. We're winded, bloodied, and fading fast, panic grips the party. Before anyone can move to help her Rayne is engulfed by the slimy muck filled mass that is Lorgoth. Drawn into the mass only her head and upper torso remain outside the creature. Kraegon scrambles to climb the raised platform and save Shanan but can't seem to pull himself over the ledge. All the while, undamaged and morale unbroken Galduhr swings his mighty warpick. Ava takes aim with her shortbow, thinks twice on the matter, and decides Rayne may be a more merciful target at this point, thinks thrice on the matter and dashes to assist Shanan. Kraegon in his last conscious act, casts Bless on the remaining party members, even Galduhr, and then goes down hard. Ava passes a medicine check on Shanan, stabilizes him and drags him into the decrepit chamber filled with rotting corpses. Standing alone Galduhr reasons one last possibility in the face of great adversity. Galduhr grabs Kraegon's unconscious body and begins to drag him towards the sacrificial alter. \"One Must Die\" Lorgoth lumbers past Galduhr  with Rayne in tow. Ava runs back into the room bow drawn.\n\nLorgoth the Decayer rears up, hefting Rayne's unconscious form high into the air. With a sickening slap Lorgoth swings Rayne into the sacrificial alter. Rayne's body pulps on impact, flesh and bone splattering in every direction. Lorgoth looms above the alter unmoving.\n\nGalduhr resumes dragging Kraegon to the sacrificial alter, warpick at his side, and as an insight check reveals, murder in his eyes. Galduhr glances at Lorgoth waiting for a sign. Ava fires an arrow at Galduhr hoping to kill him but missing entirely. Galduhr drops Kraegon at the base of the alter and readies a warpick killing blow. Lorgoth lumbers back into his resting place and falls apart into bones and bits. Time passes, no lights remain in the room, Ava can no longer see Galduhr. The sound of a warpick striking hard stone echos around the room. Ava lights a candle, pulls out her sword and approaches Galduhr for perhaps one final bout of pointless bloodshed. Instead of Kraegon's head split open like a melon, Ava finds a chip in the stone next to Kraegon, and Galduhr over top him stabilizing his unconscious form.\n\nAva explains that she dragged Shanan into the last room and that he's fine.\n\nGalduhr tells Ava that he took care of Kraegon, and that they should get out of here. \n\nGalduhr walks away from Kraegon leaving Ava to drag him. Little remains of Rayne but Ava pockets a boneshard for proper burial. As Galduhr slides the hidden door back into place Ava mutters death rites. Shanan is quickly tossed over Kraegon's shoulder and the two standing party members take the unconscious survivors back upstairs. \n\n\nDripping wet, covered in the bits and pieces of their late party member, surrounded by two slumped over and beat up unconscious party members, Galduhr and Ava slink down against the wall.\n\nCombat is over, our clocks are striking midnight, today is Rayne's PC's actual birthday.\n\nGalduhr's PC: \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
