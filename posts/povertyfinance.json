We're  in the process of purchasing the memberships for everyone and picking the second round of memberships that went back to the pool because of non-responsive individuals. Please do not modmail us asking if you've been picked. That's an automatic way to make sure you don't get picked.\n\nPlease think twice about sending us modmails. Everything you need to know is in this sticky, it's in the edits. It only clutters up our modmail and diverts time away from tending to the sub and purchasing the memberships. It's very frustrating to get 5 - 10 modmails a day from folks who have read the sticky but still want an individual answer that is the same as what's in here. Please don't. Spare us our sanity :D I work graveyard and go to university during the day and moderate here. I'm getting these bought on breaks, in between classes and before I go to bed or over dinner. So please have patience. I'm dealing with cross border banking as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COUNTRY UPDATES:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**United States**\n\n*Purchased:*  A through S\n\n*Shipped:*  A through R\n\n*Not Bought Yet:* T - Z, Re-picks\n\nUSPS is delivering them. It takes approx. 2 weeks from ordering them for them to be received you the winner. It's coming. I promise. I sincerely promise. 2nd round folks, yours have not been bought yet. Please have patience. Above all remember that I, Mothra, am in Canada and you are in the US. Cross border banking is a hell of a thing and it takes 5-10 minutes to purchase each and every single membership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Canada**\n\nThird round picking is happening for 3 more people. PLEASE RESPOND SWIFTLY, so we can mail the memberships out to you.\n\nEveryone else - if you don't get them by February 10th, please let me know. It can take up to 3 weeks for mail to make it from where I live, to you. 5 of you got two envelopes addressed to you. 3 have been sent back. If you receive two of them, please reach out so we can make sure to get the two back and get CommunityFunds money back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nThey are in the process of being mailed out! They made it to the hands of our individual helping us in the UK and will keep you further updated.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674673796.0},{"title":"What one item\/Subscription would you feel you would best benefit from, under $100.","author":"AMothraDayInParadise","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11lf1a6\/what_one_itemsubscription_would_you_feel_you\/","text":"We want to hear from everyone, not just the Americans.

And you feel like a kid, like if you could only afford this one nice thing you would feel better (not true of course).\n\n**So what about if we gathered a list of things you can do for free?**\n\nFor me for example:\n\nI can do yoga or exercise at home.\n\nI can't go to do my nails (tbh I've never done that)- but I have nail polish at home, I can play with that. I also have some sample free face masks I haven't yet tried.\n\nI can't get a coloring book now, but in the calmer moments, I'm great at drawing and really all I need is paper and pencil, but I do have some watercolors and supplies gathered through the years- I can find a tutorial for a fun drawing and follow it.\n\nWhen I was young, I would take my phone (still at the time when they had awful cameras but who cares) and I would take a walk on my own on random streets of my city and take pictures, like a tourist. Honestly it was very fun.\n\nAlso, some museums have a free entrance day, so that can be checked.\n\nRecently, I discovered my local English-language library membership is free, and although they are small it's a cool way to get some stuff to read. They add new books regularly. Also recently I noticed that after few months pass, they move old magazines to giveaway bin, which is awesome, because I can use pictures from them for my journaling and collaging.\n\nThose are few of my ideas, what are some of yours?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678706374.0},{"title":"A few months ago someone asked \u201cwhat happens to us?\u201d","author":"ongoldenwaves","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11ptnz1\/a_few_months_ago_someone_asked_what_happens_to_us\/","text":"A few months ago I saw a post in here asking something along the lines of \u201cWhat happens to us when we get older? Are we just left to die?\u201d Etc \n\nI\u2019ve seen some situations lately where I\u2019d say the answer to this is \u2026 yeah, you\u2019re kind of on your own. \n\nI saw a situation where an older lady turned off her utilities to save money and the city condemned her house. She lived in her front yard for months! No toilet. No running water. There was no where for her to go. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to physical therapists rehabbing elderly patients who were living in sheds and garages with a bucket for a toilet\u2026.in cold areas of the country. \n\nI\u2019ve seen old people refusing to give up living in hcol areas move into their cars. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with having family close. They just refuse to leave places like California and live near family in another state. \n\nI\u2019ve also read the book Nomadland with tons of stories about retiree nomads. \n\nPoint of this post is this: you will grow old. Prepare for it. \n\nFirst set up a social security sign on, log in and make sure you have worked long enough to get social security. If you\u2019ve worked for yourself and haven\u2019t paid into the system you may be surprised to learn you have zero waiting. \n\nSecond don\u2019t count on relatives. You think because you paid for someone\u2019s college or helped them buy a house etc they\u2019ll be there for you? More often than not relatives will be hard to find at the end of your life. Do not squander your money helping out people if you have nothing saved for retirement. \n\nAnd third\u2026save something. Anything. Maybe you see posts on social media of people making 8 figures with millions saved and think \u201cWhy bother?\u201d Bother with your future and don\u2019t compare yourself to others. \n\nFourth, don\u2019t count on your lcol area being cheap forever. So many people are moving from hcol areas buying up housing in cheaper areas or taking the subsidized senior housing spots your state might have had. \n\nFifth\u2026simplify your life. Don\u2019t have a ton of stuff that\u2019s hard to maintain. Keep it simple so you aren\u2019t overwhelmed when you\u2019re too old to handle it well. Keep the clutter away. Make sure paths are clear so you can get around with a cane or walker. Live in one story. Do this years before you need to because one day you\u2019ll get too tired to tackle it. \n\nSo \u201cwhat happens to us?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t wait for something to happen. Be proactive.  The last part of your life is still mostly up to you. There won\u2019t be anyone around to pick up the pieces if you leave  it to chance. It doesnt always \u201cjust work out.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678664209.0},{"title":"Honestly, sometimes it be like that.

They discount over abundant food from the day or, they do grab bags. download to learn more. \n\n- worlds best cat litter is the best. keep up with your cleaning and the litter can last a long time. and flush it! \n\n- food pantries in different areas will give you different things. scour each to see which food selections you like\n\n- UBEREATS walking, if you live in a city where you can deliver by foot, you can totally make $300-600 a week. go near coffee places from 6am-11am. fast food from 8:30pm-2:00am. they even have incentives. \n\n- don\u2019t sell your prize possessions because that will make you feel worse. keep the things that make you happy close.\n\n- now this is just a me thing, but weed kept me sane. i would ration a $10 pre roll for like 2 days. don\u2019t drink, that has more power to seriously mess things up. don\u2019t do it. depression will kick your butt, get ahead of it. if you have friends you live by and can hang out with, do it and stay busy. \n\n- if you have wishes, dreams, and goals, that are based upon YOUR abilities (painter, artist, makeup, etc.) really spend this time researching, concentrating, mapping your plans, for getting to your goals. spend some time working on projects that make you happy. if they sell, they sell, but your inspiration should be yourself, not selling. don\u2019t be a gimmick, be yourself. also, don\u2019t wait for inspiration. it might not come as fast as you want. if you can\u2019t work on a project or complete a project, do something that is project adjacent. like i design, if i didn\u2019t want to draw that day, maybe i\u2019ll watch tutorials on how other people design or something that adds to my knowledge of design. etc. apply it as you see fit. \n\nokay. i hope i don\u2019t sound silly or stupid, but it\u2019s just some of what i had to do or think about since january 9th.\n\none day soon, i\u2019ll hand out some money or resources. r\/assistance helped provide me food for two weeks. i made an amazon wish list that was very inexpensive and someone was kind to fulfill it. amazing help.\n\nreddit saves lives - thank you all","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678649713.0},{"title":"better to pay off credit cards one at a time, or a little on all of them each month?","author":"sunshine_dreaming","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11qanf4\/better_to_pay_off_credit_cards_one_at_a_time_or_a\/","text":"We currently have 3 cards. 1 has 1000, one has 1500, and one has 3600.

I'm just looking for advice about whether I should keep pushing to get my 4 year university degree or get a 2 year college degree. I live in Ontario, Canada. \n\nI'm 24 years old, and this year I decided to take control of my life again. I am currently working full time, and my plan is to pay off all my credit card debt this year so that next year I can register for school again and focus. I do financially support myself. \n\nI think my best option when I go back to school is to be an accountant. I feel like accounting is the type of degree where I will be guaranteed a job because everyone needs one.  The choice that I'm deciding between is whether I should take a 4 year program at university or do 2 years at a college. \n\nI have some credits from when I was at university. I left because I was failing however there are courses that I did do good in. If I were to to college I think I would have at least 1 year knocked off because of those transfer credits. The reason why I am thinking of college is because if I did get a college diploma it would help me to have a job that is not minimum wage. Could I get a CPA with a college diploma, I'm not sure. Perhaps I could get my college diploma, leave my minimum wage job and find a job with my diploma, and then continue on with my university degree. Or maybe that would be a waste of time and I should just continue straight with the university degree. It would take me between 2-3 years to get the university degree because I have failed courses and my GPA is so low that I would have to boost it. But I know that having a university degree holds weight. \n\nI'm not really sure if this post made sense but I guess the questions that I'm asking are along the lines of:\n\n\\- is it worth it to get an accounting degree from a college as opposed to a university\n\n\\- does anyone have any experience getting a college diploma first, working and then going back to complete university\n\n\\- does anyone have any experience studying accounting or working as an accountant?  How was the salary for you?

I took one this morning and it's still positive, and frankly I still feel kinda sick. Also, my son tested positive for the first time\/day. So I called my bosses and said what do I do? Essentially there are no options for me. Everyone just happily keeps telling me, well get rest feel better. \n\nI'm like, what do I do about not getting paid?

However it seems like every job I find in this new career requires multiple years of running projects for multi-million dollar companies as experience...and I don't know anyone in the industry here. So far I've been attempting to freelance as well as actually finish and release a game, but obviously I'm starting from the ground here so....it will take time.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago, I was in touch with creditors at one point and was even able to make 2 pretty hefty payments, but then I was layed off my job and was lied to about a changeover that took months rather than weeks. I tried explaining this to the creditor after but they didn't seem to care and I ended up just hanging up on them, I haven't answered since then...\n\nSo from what I've researched, it seems what would probably happen next at this point is asset seizure to try and pay it off, which honestly I would have done already if I had any assets to sell off. The best I can do is my tv which is maybe a couple hundred, and a broken switch with no controllers. With that out of the way from what I've read there's only one other option, which I assume is what they are going to go for, wage garnishment.  \nHere's where I need advice...I'm reading that in B.C. specifically they just straight up garnish 30% of your wage without taking into account living expenses? I make less than 20k a year, my rent is 950 which is the cheapest you can find anywhere, groceries are about 30-40% and then the other 10% or so goes to bills. That's it, I don't go out\/eat out, I might buy a video game like once every few months if I can afford it, I don't even buy clothes or shoes I just resew\/tape them back together. I don't see any part of my life that I can reduce the cost of without either reaching malnutrition or being forced to live on the street.\n\nWhat do I do?","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678583292.0},{"title":"13,000 Er bill","author":"periwinkletweet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11oobf9\/13000_er_bill\/","text":"Not sure the best place to ask this.

I found the apartment online and all of my contact with the management company was electronic, including the signing of all the documents such as the lease and the inventory condition. I have previously rented from this company and had a generally positive experience, so at the very least I knew it wasn\u2019t a scam.I wanted to stay on top of things and for March, I made my rent payment through the online portal ( in this case AppFolio) on February 21st. \n\nWell, two days after that, I received an email from another property management stating that they were taking over the apartment complex I\u2019m living in. Soon after that, my AppFolio account with the previous company was deactivated. On the 23rd of February, I called the new company to inform them that I had already made my March rent payment and the person I spoke to asked for the payment confirmation which I then emailed to her. She told me once they received all the rent funds from the other company they would apply it to my new account with them.\n\nOn March 1st, my account was still showing that I owed the rent payment so I called the property management company again and I spoke with the same person, who actually remembered me. I told her I was worried about having to pay late fees when I\u2019ve already paid my rent, and she told me that they would waive any late fees once they received the payment.\n\nIt is now March 7th, and my account has been charged nearly $100 in late fees so clearly the other company still hasn\u2019t given the payment over. I tried calling the original property management company and could not get an answer from an actual person,so I left a voicemail but have not received a callback.\n\nSeeing these charges adding up is giving me extreme anxiety and while I could eat the cost of the fees and pay the rent again, I would have to dip out of savings to do so and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have do that anyways.

I have a lot of stress in my life so they might be from stress. Plus the area I sleep on is quite uncomfortable so it could be a chiropractic issue as well. I really don't know what the cause of the headaches are and since it could be so many things it will likely cost a lot of money to diagnose.\n\nSo my doctor wants me to go to an Ear, Nose, and throat specialist next..

For those looking to make some extra cash driving people, services like Uber and Lyft still seem to be great options, but I've also heard many bad stories and experiences from people working there (or other taxi apps in Europe). So while I'm looking for people who work as drivers and would like to tell us how much they make on average, the conditions they operate in, and their general opinion about the apps, I've already done some research and got to some pros and cons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne advantage of working with Uber or Lyft is the flexibility they offer. You can set your own hours and work whenever you want, which makes it a great option if you need a side hustle that fits around your schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother benefit is that getting started is relatively easy. The application process is straightforward, and you can be up and running in no time. There's also the potential to earn decent money. While earnings can vary, some drivers are able to make a decent living driving for these services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, there are also some downsides I've seen pop up. For one thing, there are no benefits like health insurance or paid time off. You're also responsible for maintaining your own vehicle, which can be costly. Also, if you decide to apply to become a driver, remember that you'll need to keep track of your earnings and tax expenses. Today, though, it's pretty easy to generate real-looking stubs with a [paystubs creator](https:\/\/www.paystubcreator.net\/) to make tax time easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any case, while driving for Uber or Lyft can be a good way to make some extra cash, it's not for everyone. The social element of meeting so many new people is great for some but can be a burden for others, while the money you make may not seem enough to cover all related expenses in some areas or countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: What are the pros and cons of working with apps like Lyft and Uber today? Is it worth it for some extra cash?

Visiting food banks when my work schedule doesn't conflict with their operating hours. I had to pay a babysitter out of pocket to watch my toddler tomorrow, because her daycare is closed (lady who runs it has been shut down since Thursday so not only did she get paid for this week, I'm paying even *more* to find alternative child care) and my manager would not let me take tomorrow off because the store is already short-staffed.

Minimal wage (here they are only to laugh at, minimal wage means extreme poverty) in my region is 16k\/month gross (full time = 168 h a month + unpayed breaks). My wage is 149\u20b1\/h gross + sales (not that much of %). Taxes are taken from your wage every payment, not in the end of the year.\n\nSo yesterday I understood I somehow stupidly miscalculated my second part of Feb salary (will get it on 10th) and imagined it to be 7,5k bigger. Have no idea how I managed to get that number wrong. Adding the fact my whole store gets fined (we somehow lost some goods which showed during inventarisation so now the cost is deducted from our wages) I'm 9,5k behind my (lowest possible) budget for March.\n\nI also had to suddenly move from home in the second part of February. First rent + deposit + agent's commission turned my small savings into 25k of credit card debt. And I'm 100% sure it was the best deal available in the area (which is deep suburbs so it's relatively \"cheap\"). Studio appt I got is 15k\/month + water & electricity (est 4k in cold part of the year) and it's the cheapest place available (there were literally no rooms in the area). Plus it has more (and nicer) furniture than other listings and it had no \"slavs (i. e. white people) & citizens only\" requirement (racist requirements are a classic here) and this type of places is usually 25+% more expensive. And landlord lives in a 3h drive from me so I'll never actually see him.\n\nSo when I realised that I'll get less money than I thought I was crying a lot cause first I got into dept just to rent a place (so it's not even mortgage, which is an average thing) but at least that was extra expenses of a first month but now what, I'll get even more debt just to pay my usual rent??? And will probably get even more in April cause this March there're less shifts available in my workplace??? \n\nI also had WiFi router installed on Friday (yes, I do really need WiFi, I've minimum internet in my mobile phone plan and it's cheaper to pay for Wifi than to swich for enough one). When I was discussing payment amount with the manager several days before, she said it's 3k for the router + 450\u20b1\/month with an advanced payment. But somehow in my account on their website it shows they've only charged me for monthly payment cause they desided to rent me a router instead of selling it to me. So now I have 3k more (well, actually I'm behind my budget 3k less, but untill rent payment day it's \"3k more\").\n\nThis made me cry again but now tears of joy. 3k is 2 weeks of food\/neccesaties like toilet paper \u2014 still tight budgeting and sale hunting but it's for 3 proper meals a day. Which is not the way I was eating lately: going with 1 or 2 (smaller) meals per day and Sunday lunch being just tea and cookies in a church after a mass provided by the parish.\n\nAs for 6,5k I still need this month (and getting enough money for April) I'll be doing leaflet distribution gigs (payment on the same day & ability to choose your schedule) as much as possible so I'll probably get through it, but the fact that I don't have to pay these 3k is indeed a huge relief.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678046482.0},{"title":"consolidate debt options?","author":"tired-and-broke-69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11k4dvp\/consolidate_debt_options\/","text":"In 2020 I was diagnosed with a rare brain issue that has left me bedridden for several years.

I was able to work through college and received grants, scholarships, and paid off all my debt within a year of getting my bachelor's. Currently, my only regular bills are my rent, car payment, wifi, phone, groceries\/gas and electric\/utilities.\n\nAfter my health insurance and taxes and everything are taken out from my paycheck, my income is less than my bills cost each month, which has made everything impossible for me. I make too much money (by like $150\/month) for any extra help from the government, but any extra expense (such as a doctor's appt, car maintenance, clothes for my job) is not possible to afford without selling extra belongings out of my house or looking for side jobs that will get me by each month.\n\nI know I have to just keep holding on until I can secure another job that pays better, but is there something here that I'm missing? So many people my age are able to go shopping, order packages, go out to eat, take small trips sometimes, and they have more expensive things, student loans, and continue to have thriving social lives. What else can I do to put myself in a better position?\n\nI'm not even going to go into detail about the strain that being broke puts on every single relationship I have, or how anxious and depressed I've gotten over the last few years. Eating properly has become such a struggle when I have to choose between paying for therapy or dinner. I don't understand how there are people who can live their lives so wastefully when there are so many people in positions just like me, probably lots of people even worse off. People who say money doesn't buy happiness have never been traumatized by the cost of being poor.\n\nIf anyone can relate or can think of anything that would help people in my type of situation, please share, it's so much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: There have been some incredible responses and messages and I am so blown away by how supportive everyone has been, I wish I could respond to all of you. There are a handful of suggestions that I haven't tried yet (or even heard of), so those will be first on my list. I also agree with most of you that reducing the rent or car payment would probably make the biggest impact until I am able to build up a savings. Combined with another source of income from a part time job or side gig, I should be in a much more manageable position. A year ago, two years ago, my situation was MUCH worse than where I am now, and it took a ton of work to get to this spot, but I came to reddit because I noticed my progress slowing down and I've just felt stuck. All of the advice and support has been super helpful and I hope other people who are dealing with similar circumstances can find some help here too.

When I graduated from college 4 years ago I moved back in with my family and it was a complete and total nightmare but I got a job working as a teacher since my degree was in social science.\n\nI was making about 45,000 a year and not paying rent so it was nice but me and my family did not get along whatsoever. I went to a university 3 and a half hours away and stupidly took out a private student loan. When I was going to school there they gave me money to help pay for my expenses throughout the semester so I didn\u2019t have to work and I was living by myself and away from my family. \n\nLast summer I decided to transfer programs to another university that\u2019s close to where I grew up. The only issue is that they gave me alot less money to support myself and my rent was higher where I moved because everyone wants to live here. So I knew I had to work. I interviewed for another teaching job but it didn\u2019t fit with my school schedule and it was a 2 hour commute each day.

That was too much for me.\n\n\nI did some budgeting and I figured out I need to make around 47-50,000 a year full time in order for me to live in the situation I\u2019m in right now.

At the moment I\u2019m working a substitute teacher job which does not pay a lot of money but it\u2019s all I got right now. \n\n\nI know I made some ill advised decisions but I just want to get my life back on track and stabilize myself financially.  The one thing I will never do again is live with my parents. It had a horrible impact on my mental health and they are extremely emotionally abusive and narcissistic.

My mom told me it was so difficult for her to raise us and paying for our education. She said she often considered giving up and suicide for the whole family, but she persevered through in the end. I didn't feel that we were that poor, I even got toys and games to play with, although never gotten them brand new.\n\nI remember I loved eating ramen, cheap sausages, deep-fried spam with rice when I was a kid, but only realized when I was older that it was only because we couldn't afford proper food. \n\nWhen I was 12, I told my mom that I wanted to be rich one day, and I would buy her all she ever wanted. With the help of my relatives, I went to China and studied the language, graduated college there, and started working. Wage was okay, I was earning $9k per year as a customer service worker when I started at 22 years old, which might not be much for US standard, but it was already triple what I would have earned if I were to work in my home country.\n\nI always worked hard and diligently, I had the phillosophy that I was still young, and I got nothing else beside my youth and energy, all I need to do is grind, and whatever the pay, with OT compensation or not, I would do whatever that was put in front of me the best I could. And people noticed, I got employee of the year award for 2 consecutive years, with a $400 bonus each. It's not much, and my colleagues and friends would mock me and say that I was gullible, I was working too hard, I was slaving away for people that earns 100x of my income, but I didn't care. I just work.\n\nThen one day my mom called me, saying that our family is in a huge debt, because she borrowed her credit card to her brother to help with his business (turns out it had been going on for years), but one day he couldn't pay, and we were suddenly in $30k of debt.\n\nSince then, I decided to help them pay off the debt with my salary every month, and I had been living paycheck to paycheck for 7 years. I know that it sounds crazy, but hiring lawyers, declaring bankruptcy, suing, are not so common in my country, and usually responsibilities are tied within one family. \n\nAt my 7th year, I was earning $21k per year. And I often felt sad and cried alone in my room, feeling that I had been working so hard for so long but it never shows in my bank account, all my friends were doing much better than me, I always felt that I was a loser.\nBut finally, 2 years ago, all the debts was finally paid off, it was the best day of my life. And at the same year, the company that I was working for took off, our product was tremendously successful, and I was given huge raises year after year, and now I earn over $100k a year, I was so ecstatic! That finally I can start to save and even invest some of my earnings, and ultimately I truly could buy my mom whatever she wants. \nWhatever people might say, I'm glad that I persevered through, that I decided to help my family, to cherish them more than my financial situation, that my mom could live her last years comfortably, (she's 72y\/o) and she's proud of me. And ultimately, I am at peace and have no regrets.\n\nThanks for this community, your posts accompanied me when I felt down over the years, I wish the best luck for all of you.

If you're familiar with the improvement model known as continuous improvement (it's exactly as it sounds) then you might have an idea of what I'm after.  \n\nWe don't have to have scientific brainstorm sessions with guided efficiency. Honestly just having someone to bounce ideas off of, or say \"how would you improve X Y Z situation?\"  \n\nI believe \"success in life\" would be a major theme, of course, but no topic is off the table. Want to chat about improving skin quality? Alright. Want to chat about what grocery items you should have on hand for a well-stocked pantry to support home cooking? Let's chat. This can meander through any topic your or my brain produces.  \n\n**Who I'm looking for:** You don't have to be rock bottom. Just someone trying to make it through the world. Someone mature enough to think positively, or at least not constantly negative. Someone who sees the value in improving all areas of life. I don't do well with the idea of \"good enough\", instead my thought process is typically \"if it can be improved, it should be improved\". And then lastly, someone who has discord (text only) because that's my primary social platform.  \n\nAge doesn't matter. Gender doesn't matter, although due to a certain personal history, I have a natural distrust of men. That's a problem with me, not you. Marital status doesn't matter.  \n\nI had thought about taking this concept and creating a discord community, but I don't possess the entrepreneurial spirit to do that. I also struggle to layout my problems in public, which is why I'm seeking one person.  \n\n**Who am I?** 34 year old single male living in Kansas. Uneducated, unemployed. Essentially I'm at rock bottom, and by being here I've had a major shift in thinking lately.

I log my daily expenses there since 2019 Dec. I also update my assets minus liabilities every month. Since early 2021, that number is going down every single month.

Now everything is messed up more","author":"daveishere7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11gzwoz\/lost_my_keys_last_night_while_working_over_night\/","text":"I was doing an shift last night and somehow I didn't attach my keys to my carabiner. And did not hear it slip and hit the ground. Ended up retracing my steps for hours on hours. Asking stores, homeless people and all but to my bad luck I did not find the keys.\n\n\nNow I get back to my building thinking \"no worries, my landlord could at least let me in my apartment\". And my landlord is an older Dominican guy who barely could speak a lick of English but is somehow always pissed off at anyone who talks to him.\n\n\nThus guy tells me \"oh no, no call the office. Money, money, money. Me don't open your door\". And then the office is even worse you always call them to ask questions and they basically dodge it. Then tell you sorry were only the answering service.\n\n\nSo I had to end up calling a bunch of locksmiths. And I don't have any type of money for this. What I was working last night was to pay for my late phone bill. And to basically try to buy my groceries for next week. Now I'm going to end up having to pay every last dollar of the $50 in my account. When most of the services say it's like up to $100. So I'm trying g to hopefully talk them down.\n\n\nBut just worked like 7 hours and barely made anything. Yet still very much existed, stressed and feeling like I'm going to fall out from the stress. So I'm hoping I can at least get into my apartment and they work out a deal with me.\n\n\nThen I will have to probably still pay an additional like $15 for the train. That I will have to take from NYC to New Rochelle to pick up my keys again. And also pay for the replacement at that. I haven't been this stressed in so long. Like why would someone pick up someone else's keys and take them? What do you get from that at all?!!\n\nI went to the police station, stores and in and out. So I know it wasn't left in the area around where I lost it. My life is really crumbling due to losing some damn keys. And having to deal with a shitty landlord and building service. Now I have to remake my phone bill money before Sunday, along with groceries and more. I hate to complain but this is so annoying.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677847649.0},{"title":"Tripped in a pothole at work, phone damaged.","author":"Pbandsadness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11hf80d\/tripped_in_a_pothole_at_work_phone_damaged\/","text":"I tripped in a very large pothole (crater, really) at work, stumbled, and fell into another nearby crater.

I\u2019m a 28F living in a HCOL city in Texas.\n\nMy partner (31M) and I (28F) met in February 2022 and have had a blossoming relationship ever since. He truly is my soul mate, best friend, and favorite person.\n\nLast year was extremely tumultuous, he had a loss in his family and I had a severe surgery. We were dealing with extremely difficult life situations before we even knew each others favorite colors.\n\nBut through it, we persevered. \n\nFor context, I am an only child who is extremely ambitious and healing through some CPTSD from my childhood. I\u2019ve been going to therapy since 2020 and finding resolutions in my daily life. I am extremely passionate about financial independence and have had a 401K since I was 21, save every week in a high-yield savings account, and am trying to purchase a house (but might put that on pause due to the insane market right now)\n\nMy partner is from an extremely small town in Texas and trying to navigate building his life. His parents immigrated here with nothing and him and his siblings grew up in poverty. He\u2019s the only one to go to college (albeit later in life) and had no idea about how to truly position himself for success after graduation.\n\nLast month, we had a talk about our finances and ever since, I\u2019ve been an anxious, neurotic wreck.\n\nI am working so hard to achieve financial independence and as much as I care about partner, his finances are stressing me tf out. He listens to me and is willing to change for the better, but he\u2019s not as ambitious as I am. The longer he puts things off, the more in interest he will be paying.\n\nI want him as a life partner and vice versa, so I am honestly investing in him \/ us\u2026 but today\u2026.  I did the financial calculation and oof\u2026\n\nLast month, this is where his finances were:\n\n1. CC 1 - 28.9% APR - $1,126\n2. CC 2 - 28.4% APR - $876\n3. CC 3 - 26.7% APR - $305\n4. Personal Loan - 21.8% APR - $3,801\n5. Car - 15.1% APR - $20,806\n6. Student Loans - TBD - $36,027\n\nHe also had an Earnin account where he was getting $500 up front for a fee. And a Fingerhut account where he would buy toys for his nieces \/ nephews thinking it would help his credit.\n\nI remember feeling overwhelmed, but in control knowing this. I decided to loan him $6,800 (I know, many of you probably think I\u2019m stupid\u2026 but it\u2019s my decision and I am willing to suffer the consequences if he doesn\u2019t pay me back, but of course, I\u2019m very hopeful that he will.) so that he can get away from as much high interest as possible. The $6,800 paid off CC 1-3, the personal loan, his Earnin, and Fingerhut accounts. \ud83c\udf89 \n\nInitially, I thought he could refinance his car for a lower rate\u2026 but I just found out he\u2019s upside down in it. I had a full breakdown because the light at the end of the tunnel seems further and further now\u2026 he\u2019s currently paying a minimum payment of $481 per month\u2026 for a 72-month loan\u2026\u2026 I know\u2026\u2026\n\nHis car is worth $11k or so and he owes $20,806 at 15.1%. I have been trying to think of solutions and I honestly don\u2019t know. A part of me thought, maybe he should sell this car and then just get a personal loan from a local credit union to pay off the remaining debt and I drive him to \/ from work? I\u2019m trying to think of anything. He got this car when he lived in Colorado and needed something to drive in the ice \/ snow. Now, he\u2019s in Texas so in my head, he doesn\u2019t need this!!! He could be fine with an old Camry or Honda\u2026 but he\u2019s upside down now\u2026 so I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m grateful to have never been in these positions before, but I also don\u2019t know how to get out of them and he doesn\u2019t know either\u2026\n\nWhat worries me the most, is the potential for student loan repayments beginning after whatever the Supreme Court decision is in June \/ July and his salary just not being enough to cover his debts. I also set up a payment plan for him to pay me $332 per month to pay back my loan\u2026. \n\nHe makes $40k right now and has an Information Systems degree. He\u2019s applied for over 120+ roles since last August, but has not gotten any offers yet. It\u2019s also more challenging because he\u2019s older which is a whole conversation in itself.\n\nHis family is all in poverty too and even though he only makes $40k, they ask HIM for help. I tell him he can\u2019t, but he always wants to. His family also see him as their lifeline \u2014 they all plan for him to take care of their nieces and nephews if they die and they don\u2019t take care of their health, so unfortunately, it could be likely\u2026 and they don\u2019t have life insurance or inheritance or anything to help their kids\u2026 again, the burden falls on my partner. I try to explain that he genuinely cannot afford it. We\u2019ve never fought, but tensions are definitely getting high around money. But I want to make this work, truly.\n\nHe told me he feels extremely insecure and shameful, but I tell him that I want to help him resolve this, which is why I gave him the loan for $6,800. But I need him to show me that he cares about our future.\n\nHe also wants kids and I told him I\u2019d only have kids if we were financially secure, otherwise no dice. But by that time, I\u2019ll likely be 35+ which is a geriatric pregnancy and I am not putting my life on the line for a child.\n\nAnywho, I just want help. I\u2019m exhausted and I can\u2019t do it all. I told him I need him to take more initiative and show me that he\u2019s passionate in investing in himself and our future. I understand that I\u2019m a bit neurotic about finances and I don\u2019t want to push him away, but I want him to get out of debt so we can enjoy life. Right now, I\u2019m paying for both of us to do things that I can afford in my lifestyle\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I love myself when I\u2019m with him \u2014 he makes me happier than anyone and I feel most myself with him. I just feel so safe with him. I want to feel financial security too. Please give us advice on how to move forward\u2026\n\nEdit: definitely responsive to the negative reaction I\u2019ve received. I will back off and stop enabling him and just remind myself that we are still very early on and everything will work out in the end.\n\nEdit II: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s perspectives. Especially the critical ones. I am thinking long and hard about certain areas of my life. One thing I wanted to clarify: I also come from a poverty stricken immigrant family \u2014 my mom had to file for bankruptcy when I was younger and it was tough and I am doing everything in my power to avoid something similar. Two, he knows I have severe anxiety, I know he is working on his finances. We aren\u2019t perfect. We are working together. I spoke to my therapist and she agreed with many of you that I need to set healthier boundaries. These are not my problems, they\u2019re his. I need to focus on myself and hope that he focuses on himself. I do want to apologize for some of my improper wording.

I\u2019ve recently been sued by a Hospital for 12k; I\u2019ve have answered to the summon. I\u2019ve also contacted their lawyers to try to work a settlement deal or payment plan. They wanted $250 a month (stipulated judgement); I am 24- in school and as of right now I can\u2019t afford that. More than half my income goes to rent and that\u2019s not including any other expenses for the month. We verbally agreed on good faith of payments of $100.

Any ideas? Details below.","author":"BihgBohy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11dt5dy\/put_all_my_savings_into_tiny_house_on_wheels\/","text":"Basically my old landlord kept raising my rent, eventually I said F it and spent the only 2000$ I had saved on a little tiny home on wheels that was rlly beat up, and was gonna travel around in it playin music and livin my dream. But as we know pipe dreams don\u2019t always work out. Once I got it I moved in w my parents for a few months fixing it up, and eventually I was sleeping in it and cooking all my meals in there ect. \n\nBefore moving back with parents I was working at a farm in Northern California and I called them and they said that I could move to the farm rent free if I just worked like 30 hours a week (at 15$ an hour). I was more than down so I moved up there right away, as my parents didint have work for me and they live in a v small town where work is kinda scarce. \n\nOnce I got up to the farm I stayed there for a couple more months with my puppy and worked on the trailer\/farm. Eventually it was road worthy and I was about to get it registered\/insured and whatnot. \n\nThen the January storms came. First couple nights weren\u2019t that bad, but January 2nd, (6days before my bday lol) I woke up to the trailer shaking like crazy. I knew I had to abandon ship and maybe try and tow my trailer somewhere safer (I was parked up on a peak, there was a barn shielding me from the wind but the wind was coming from the opposite direction it usually does).\n\nI started grabbing my computer bag, and then grabbed my wallet. Then I felt the trailer tip on 2 wheels and crash back down, my kitchen knives thrown everywhere, my puppy so scared I was so sad. I had to just leave before I got myself killed. \n\nApon tryin to open the door I realized it was almost impossible. The 70+mile an hour winds were blasting directly at my only door and I couldn\u2019t get it open. I sat there kinda frozen in panick, heard the wind calm for a second, and just full sprint battering rammed the door, holding my dog on a leash behind me. \n\nOnce me and my dog (jojo, she\u2019s an Akita) got out I instantly was swept off my feet by the wind and was getting dragged across the gravel driveway. I waswnt letting go of jojos collar tho. She actually stopped me from being pulled farther by digging her claws into the gravel and stopping us. I slowly crawled to my car and got us inside. \n\nI look over and my friend who lived up there was holding his sailboat down from the wind. I yelled \u201cyou need help?\u201d He looked at me in shock and I hopped out of my car, got picked up 3 or 4 inches off the ground (as my friend told me later) and slammed onto my back. Wind kinda pushed me over to where he was tho. We hooked the sailboat up to his truck and I held onto one side of it while we pulled it around the barn. \n\nOnce the sailboat was good I tried to hook my trailer up to my car but I kept getting knocked over by the wind, as it was getting worse. Also the trailer was shaking a ton and made it rlly hard to back up to it\/not feel like I was gonna get crushed. And if my car flipped or got messed up by any of the sheet metal or plywood or wheelbarrows or shovels flying all around I would b pretty screwed. After crying a little bit I left.\n\nDrove down the road for 2 mins and felt a surge of hope, that maybe if I tried harder I could save it. I turned around and when I got back it was Litterally upside down, walls cracked open, rain pouring on everything, and it was getting dragged across the gravel. \n\nAfter crying some more I left once again.\n\nI instantly went to my friends house in the nearest town. It was 7:30 am  when I got there and he was just waking up.\n\nIdk why I felt like typing this all, I am just so tired of it all still, and haven\u2019t really processed it. \n\nAlso the day before that happened, my grandma died, then the next day my car wouldent start for some reason, which took weeks to figure out.\nAnd a week prior to my house getting destroyed my partner of 2 years dumped me sorta, and I don\u2019t wanna go into details but was tryin to make me  jealous at this show I went to and was bein rlly hurtful. It\u2019s whatever tho I want her to b happy tbh. \n\nI also might b living In my car soon because housing is rlly hard to find where I am at and what I can find is waaay too over my budget so rn I just feel horrible and like I am losing in life in every aspect.\n\nMy whole music studio, most of my memorabilia, and trinkets, photos, letters from my dad, all trash. And now I\u2019m just wishing I had got insurance on it. I just never expected anything like that to happen. \n\nIs there any disaster relief fund\/assistance or something I can get? I got photos of all the destroyed stuff. At this point I don\u2019t really care if I can\u2019t get anything for it as I\u2019ve rlly gone thru it recently and could  care less for material stuff, i just wanna be comfortable and warm with my dog, but it would be nice as I am rlly struggling rn. \n\nThanks to all who read I kinda just needed to rant. If u have any questions feel free to comment or dm. I am actually writing a book of short stories I have experienced, and this is def gonna go into the book. Also it wont be written like this don\u2019t worry haha\n\n\nTLDR; spent all of my savings on a tiny house on wheels and moved into a farm in rural Northern California. After about a month crazy winds flipped it upside down and almost killed me and my puppy in the process. Mostly just wanting to get my story out there lol.\n\n\nEDIT: jeez I did not expect this to get so much attention. Thanks for all the advice and good thoughts and wishes it\u2019s rlly making me feel better about the whole thing.

I lost my counterpart shortly after and worked the position by myself until last month.  \n\nToday I received another $2000 raise from $42k to $44k during annual performance reviews. Initially, I planned to negotiate this raise higher at the meeting we are having next week where I'll be onsite with my superiors (I work off-site in a different state) since I worked so long by myself, but once I got my counterpart again who got hired on at the $42k wage, I decided I would ask for more responsibility and a higher wage based on experience as my justification instead. However, this raise went into effect immediately and I don't think it was a bad raise (4.8% calculated) especially with having received the one in October as well.  \n\nI still plan on asking for more responsibility while at the meeting as I'm craving more now that I have a counterpart again. I also plan on heading up a project I introduced last month as a concept. I expect the project to take a couple months at least, so my question is should I negotiate my wage: A) as planned at the meeting next week even though it's already in affect for the original offer, B) at the completion of the project, or C) in 6 months time like I received before.  \n\nWhat makes most sense? I feel like I will definitely have more leverage later but I am nervous because I've never negotiated my wage with this company. I took what they offered when I got promoted to the position, and I took the raise in October that my counterpart really negotiated for, and now I'm planning pretty much to just take this one. I'm nervous, because they don't really give room to negotiate they just say that the raise given goes into effect immediately on the next paycheck. So I feel waiting until later is probably a better position? I'm not sure... I'd love some guidance.  \n\n\nEdit: Always proofread your titles... Negotiation.

I was able to pay rent until December 2022 despite a rent increase in September 2022. Unemployment benefits, help from family, and writing jobs allowed me to pay rent. During this time, I was applying for a variety of jobs until I got an offer in November 2022. However, the job required a public trust investigation, hence a lengthy background check. I did not have a timeline for when this would complete. I cannot do things like Uber\/Lyft\/DoorDash\/UberEATS because I am disabled (epilepsy) and cannot drive a car.\n\nMy aunt, who I was very close with, got sick around this time as well and she passed away in December. I was approved two weeks later but had to basically wait for a laptop to start my job. I was given an eviction notice on the second week of January and I promptly filed a response detailing the situation on why I could not pay rent at the time (lack of work and a death in the family). At this time I was only about $2,700 behind and had proposed a payment plan to catch up on this amount. Just in case, I also filed for CHAP assistance (state rental assistance) but having read all the stories about how those programs were managed and that there was no guarantee of assistance, I had also made a plan to cover this back rent. My new job pays well enough so rent ($1,182 + utilities) is only about 25% of my monthly income, so I could easily put down extra to cover the months I missed.\n\nThe laptop was sent two weeks ago and I started the very next day (February 14). I had to go through some orientation and received my first paycheck last week, which was only half a paycheck since I joined halfway through the pay period.\n\nI had kept in contact with property management this entire time, but they are notorious for not answering phone calls. I got through maybe 1 out of every 8 times, but they changed that recently since I got through the first time. Even the community manager admitted that they had forgotten about what we had talked about. Having reviewed my finances and budget, I told them I could start paying again in April and even pay extra to catch up. I was given a court date (May 3rd) to contest this, and they refused mediation, saying they wanted the full amount even though I had offered to pay extra each month. The apartment complex does not accept partial payments.\n\nOn Monday I follow up with CHAP, asking why it is taking so long to get a case worker assigned to me. I wanted to update them in regards to the amount of assistance I need (now about $5,800, and possibly more if their timeline of mid-April is accurate). The person at the CHAP offices said that they can't do anything until a caseworker is assigned to me. I am not sure what to do since I started the new job, and rental assistance isn't guaranteed.\n\nOverall, I expect to owe $7,400. I have a lot of bills that have been piling up since then, and although my new job pays well enough, I cannot front that amount of money as my credit has been shot and the death in my family has required us to put resources towards her funeral and medical bills. Is there any way to get them to come to mediation? What are my options moving forward since I now have a well-paying job? They have documentation and know that the job pays well, so can anything be done?\n\nEDIT: Would like to add a bit of context since I wrote this while I was less awake earlier.\n\nI have lived here since July 2019 and have paid on time every month, even during COVID. Property management has changed several times and this is actually the first time I have been seriously behind on rent. I have had perfect payment history otherwise since I've lived with roommates\/by myself since 2012.\n\nEDIT 2: Did a bit of math and I should have that amount in the bank in four pay periods, barring any major setbacks with other expenses.\n\nEDIT 3: Since some people are confused as to what the numbers are, and I was still a bit sleepy when I initially wrote this post:  \nI owed $2,700 when I filed in mid-January (1\/13\/23).  \nI owe $5,400 as of the time of this edit (3\/1\/23).  \nI will owe (assuming CHAP doesn't help) $6,700 by 4\/15\/23 which is when CHAP said I would be assigned a caseworker. I had said $7,400 but I am accounting for fees as well.   \nThe amount could be much closer to $8,000 by the time I go to court. Not ideal but apparently CHAP couldn't be bothered to update a single number in my application until I have a caseworker.

Due to the extreme stress that came with the lockdowns 3 years ago, I've not had the energy to go after new clients. With stress, I mean: our girl, now 10, couldn't cope with us as her replacing teachers during the lockdowns, started having emotional meltdowns as a consequence, and eventually was diagnosed ADHD and some ASD characteristics (having these insights and getting tools helped, of course, but I was already close to mental breakdown because of how things were going at home). Then she was infected by Covid19, one year ago, and she developed long covid. She's permanently at home now, leaving little time & headroom for me to work, even if I work from home.\n\nAdd my own perimenopausal moodswings to the mix, and, last year, trying new meds for ADHD, and those failing miserably. Hence: no spoons left.\n\nThis morning I went to the town office to get a new ID card, because it went missing (where did I put it, I don't know, may have been stolen because I can't find it anywhere), and I couldn't pay for it because I was over my max overdraft (the bank had taken the money out of my account to pay my credit card debt, this very same morning!) and the city office doesn't accept credit card payment.\n\nI'm infinitely grateful for the jobs I do get, through recurring clients, but right now, I'm waiting for payment from two clients, a considerable sum of money, and I've used up all my bank credit.

To go 2.5 miles and back. \n\nNormally I'd ask my sister for a ride but she just had a baby who's in the NICU so I'm not doing that. My doctor's note for work ran out yesterday. I have to work in a couple hours, but my voice is still gone because I haven't been able to get the medication. If I call in again I'm going to be one write up away from termination. I'm so frustrated!!\n\nI even asked my neighbor if her cousin could give me a ride (neighbor doesn't have a car either) but her cousin just had chemo and isn't feeling well at all. \n\nI live in a place with no sidewalks and no public transportation. Losing my car was a huge blow. I kept thinking \"if I can just make it to tax time surely I can find a cheap car and get an Uber out to look at it.\" Nope. There consistently have been no available Ubers or lyfts. \n\nI guess I'll try to hold out til my sister's baby comes home but I don't want to immediately hit her with requests either. She's going through a lot. Baby isn't doing well and I can't go visit or help out. \n\nThanks for letting me vent. It's all just hitting at once.

I, 30M live with my 29F girlfriend of 5 years in a cheaper part of California and we effectively are a one income household since she is disabled (and getting support from EDD is damn near impossible) we rent a tiny shitty apartment. \n\nWe aren\u2019t struggling ***that much*** but I only make $2k a month take-home being a entry level Ford tech. She\u2019s lucky enough to get all her medical needs met through MediCal and we get EBT as well. Huge help. \n\nHere\u2019s my dilemma. We recently took a drive down to the bay to see her family and we drove through some incredibly rich neighborhoods thanks to a I-680 detour. Enormous houses, incredible cars, that sorta thing. It got me thinking, I started stressing out\u2026 \n\nHow the hell is this level of wealth even possible? I\u2019m working my hands to the bone, sometimes being late on rent, and I truly feel like I can\u2019t humanly do anything more to advance our financial situation. I don\u2019t get it. I go to work and come home tired. I have zero energy left to do anything more. I\u2019m at my limits of capability here and I think I\u2019m doing a good job at work and they want to advance me which is good. \n\nI didn\u2019t have supportive parents. They struggled with addiction nearly my whole life, I\u2019m shocked I stayed sober and graduated high school. They hardly taught me anything. I was a stubborn kid with ADHD the entire time. She had a rough childhood as well. We weren\u2019t exactly prepared. \n\nIf you guys go to my profile you\u2019ll see I\u2019ve spent a lot of money on RC cars. I don\u2019t hide it. Hindsight I definitely shouldn\u2019t have indulged so heavily, I\u2019ve been in that scene for years, which is why I\u2019ve toned down the spending a lot recently because it\u2019s all starting to weigh on me. I\u2019ve been struggling with these bad habits for years. Once I discover something fun, I indulge in it wayyyyyy too much. I did the same thing with guitars about 8 years ago. I know I shouldn\u2019t do that, I need to practice more impulse control, I get that. \n\nMy question though is this: even if I was smarter with my money and my choices, I still have no idea how the hell these people afford enormous houses and six figure cars. How is this level of wealth possible? I see it everywhere now, young people with fancy cars and multiple properties and businesses\u2026 HOW??? Being a Ford tech I see a lot of six figure pickup trucks with all the bells and whistles meanwhile my I struggled to pay for my little economy car when I got it. I was happy to have power windows and AC. How the hell??\n\nIn my vision, had I made better choices, I could have got into mechanics sooner than I did and could have been a master tech by now that could make about 100k a year which is a little over double what I make now. That\u2019s not mansion money, that\u2019s not Rolls Royce money, that\u2019s good money for sure but not rich money from what I can tell. THAT blows my mind. \n\nWhen I was a kid I thought 100k a year was the absolute top, like \u201coh my god you must be friends with Bill Gates!\u201d level of money. I can\u2019t imagine going any higher than that. I still can\u2019t. Maybe I just don\u2019t have that \u201crich guy\u201d mentality. My mind doesn\u2019t work like that. I don\u2019t understand stocks, investing, trading, I don\u2019t get it. All I know how to do is show up, clock in, work hard, clock out, paycheck. That\u2019s all I know. Beyond that is literal gibberish to me. I like to think I\u2019m a humble guy that just goes to work, works hard an honest paycheck, and goes home to spend my time with friends and family. I\u2019ve learned that, and that alone, doesn\u2019t go very far and that bums me out because all I ever heard for years was \u201cwork hard and you\u2019ll be successful\u201d. Albeit for many years I didn\u2019t actually work that hard, but I am now and I can\u2019t see it from here. Maybe I\u2019m just being impatient, but I can still see the bottom from here and that stresses me out. \n\nI\u2019m struggling with a crisis here. On one hand, I believe hard work and smart decisions should be rewarded\u2026 but I also kinda think that level of wealth shouldn\u2019t ever be possible. It\u2019s excessive and crazy! Maybe I grew up in poverty for so long that I just can\u2019t fathom being wealthy. \n\nI\u2019m only beginning to learn how to make good choices and I hate that I\u2019ve taken this long to get here. \n\nMeanwhile my girlfriend, bless her soul, just wants to go a day without being sick. She\u2019s not thinking about money, she\u2019s thinking about staying out of the hospital. \n\nTL;DR - sorry for the wall of text, I guess I\u2019m just venting a little\u2026 how do rich people get rich? I know I made poor decisions over the years but even if I was as smart 10 years ago as I am now, I can\u2019t possibly imagine being wealthy or how it\u2019s possible.

After I quit my last job, I knew I wanted to work close to home to essentially eliminate my monthly train ticket cost. I was able to bring my monthly transportation costs from $100 to about $40 because I only use the train for commuting to friends now.\n\nDuring the pandemic I realized I could cut my own hair so now I don\u2019t pay for quarterly haircuts.\n\nI pack my lunch like most people. My go to is a $30 budget for sandwich supplies. I splurge on fancy meats so I can look forward to eating the same thing everyday.\n\nI order instant ramen in bulk on Amazon because it\u2019s much cheaper than buying the ramen at the store.\n\nI pretty much don\u2019t spend on health, personal care, or beauty at all. I haven\u2019t had the luxury of making a budget for those things in the past. I do replace one or two makeup items a year. I tend to buy the mini sizes at Sephora because frankly I don\u2019t wear much makeup. I think $50 a year for makeup is fair since I need to wear makeup to the office.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t budget it in, I probably spend $500 a year on health. I don\u2019t have any memberships to gyms. Sometimes I need to buy stuff like Pepto or Advil. I do pay for my birth control as well so that\u2019s part of the yearly budget.\n\nAs for clothes, I let myself buy one or two pieces of clothes every quarter. I try to keep that yearly expense below $600 but I do like expensive things.\n\nI pay my utilities too but me and my roommates made a pact to never turn on heating or cooling unless the weather is extreme for our area. This means heating doesn\u2019t turn on until it\u2019s 20 degrees Fahrenheit out and cooling doesn\u2019t turn on until it\u2019s 95 degrees Fahrenheit outside.\n\nI do eat out and drink out on a strict budget for NYC. Honestly this is my highest expense besides rent becauseI want to enjoy living here even though it\u2019s expensive. This means I give myself about a $30 budget for a night out but I can only go out if I have saved money and I haven\u2019t spent money the last two days.\n\nMy main goal is to keep my daily spending below $25 on average. I have a lot of no spend days during the work week and that helps me keep my average low.\n\nI\u2019ve lived on $22k a year in NYC before. I made $34k at my last job and now I\u2019m making $55k. I still don\u2019t have health benefits but I\u2019m grateful to be making enough to save money now. For anyone struggling, I hope things get better for you soon.

So that leaves me with at least one month with nowhere to go (the internship was originally expected to go through April). I don't have a car atm, and the biggest thing I want is to get another one. Unfortunately I'm still paying off a $5,000 loan for a car I wrecked last year and I'm only making $295\/week with my internship so I doubt I'll be able to get another loan anytime soon (unless I'm wrong, I do have a high credit score, but I just feel like with such low earnings I won't get approved) and definitely can't afford a car without one.

I started looking at Phoenix where there are a lot of ASU students splitting rooms informally to rent for about $400-500\/month but I've never been there before so kinda nervous (could also be a good thing though). I've also thought about Chicago, where private room rentals can be pretty affordable. However, just the actual cost of getting somewhere so far away from where I am now seems like it would eat into the money I need to save, so now I'm thinking of going somewhere closer like ATL, JAX, Orlando...(would say Miami too but looks too expensive)...but there aren't a lot of affordable short-term rentals, not a lot of jobs I'm confident that I could land and I know these cities aren't great for people without a car either.

Areas that were once affordable saw massive rent spikes, and wages in those areas didn't increase (unless you worked remotely). I want to get a cat so badly but I don't feel like I will ever get to the point where I can afford to handle a major crisis like a rent spike, roommates leaving, car breaking down, etc. Before covid they were a lot of ways to deal with rising costs of things. There was used older cars, mega commutes, moving to a cheaper area, etc. Now a lot of those options just disappeared. In California you could commute from the central valley for cheaper rent, now the central valley is pretty on par in terms of rents to the bay area. And with how bad gas prices are mega commutes will end up costing you more, not to also mention if your car ends up in the shop for an extended period, you can't go to work and have to Uber\/rent a car which defeats the purpose of moving to a cheaper area. Even moving to another state like Arizona or Nevada won't end up saving a ton of money (unless you're buying a house). And then I would make a lot less as a tech worker and have fewer job opportunities. Currently my debt is eating a 1\/4 of my income with min payments. My take home pay is 4200. I'm set to pay off loan A which will save me about 255\/month in debt payments.

But all in all affording 1500 in rent with roommates will be pretty rough even if I pay off loan A. And then there's the issue of rents just endlessly going up forever which will make owning a pet pretty rough, the last thing I would want is having to give it up.

Lots of errors and thoughts that keep running. I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I always loved the advice\/support from this group. \n\nMy mom (Lyra) kicked me out of the house last week. It came as a shock since she always spoke of the \u201cfamily should help family\u201d motto. Her reasons for kicking me out was that I didn\u2019t help around the house, which I did, I cleaned when she asked and the times I cleaned when she didn\u2019t ask her boyfriend (Larry) would complain that I didn\u2019t clean right. It\u2019s like no matter what I did it would piss someone off. Mind you the place was always a mess if I didn\u2019t clean and then when I made it all clean\/clutter free he complained that I threw everything away. It was just frustrating so I would stay in my room and only come out to clean when my mom asked me. She also says it\u2019s because I was never home and at my boyfriends place which was true, I felt more safe and welcomed there. I was probably there for 3-4 days out of the week. I payed my mom $700 in rent and I payed for my own internet. \n\nLarry and I never really got along, he always judged me on how I was living my life and saying I should do this instead of that etc. I never let it bother me because well it\u2019s my life but the thing that made the most pissed off is that he never talked to me, like total silent treatment. He would always talk to me through my mom or use my younger sister as his little messenger. In a way I always wanted to get my own place but it\u2019s kind of hard out here. I suppose I should have set myself up for leaving earlier but I always thought my mom would have my back. My relationship with my mother got worse since she\u2019s been with Larry, I would tell her personal things that she would go on to tell Larry and I didn\u2019t like that so I stopped telling her things. \n\nAnyways last Friday my mom told me she\u2019s kicking me out because I was late on giving her car insurance money(she let me use her older payed off car), I\u2019m always on time but they changed the payment date a week earlier so I was kind of tight on money and asked my mom to cover me and I\u2019d pay her back next week; and that we should change the payment date back since it would fit my schedule of payments because I like to have my bills separated. She got mad and said that I\u2019m selfish for wanting the bill to fit my schedule and I feel like maybe I was selfish. It kind of hurt she didn\u2019t want to cover me since she always covered my other sister for rent. She told me my stuff was going to be on the streets by 5pm and that I\u2019d have until the next day to pick it all up or it would be in the trash. (I was at my boyfriends place when this all happened). So we drove to my house and Larry + my sister and her boyfriend were moving all my things outside. I felt like they invaded my privacy by touching all my things and moving them, they didn\u2019t even let me be the one to pack it all up. I\u2019m not sure how to explain it but it just felt wrong\u2026 like when someone does something to you without permission. Sorry if this doesn\u2019t make sense, I mean it\u2019s not supposed to really I guess, I\u2019m just very confused. They didn\u2019t talk to me at all and just slammed the door in my face when they were done moving out all my stuff. I couldn\u2019t even take everything with me since my boyfriends car is small and there really wouldn\u2019t be any space for all my stuff anyways. I just took the things I needed and left mostly everything else. It made me sad since I worked so hard for the furniture\/things I loved, I know it\u2019s just stuff and I can always get it back but it\u2019s still sad to see my money being wasted. \n\nMy boyfriend lives with his parents still and they are so kind to me, they have agreed to take me in and help me get back on my feet. Since my boyfriend and I work at places very close to each other\/same schedule he can take me to work until I can buy a car. I\u2019m very grateful for this but I don\u2019t want to burden them. I don\u2019t feel alone because my boyfriend has been very comforting and has been doing everything to make me feel safe. Yet still I feel alone. I blocked my family from everything, I don\u2019t feel like I want to talk to them anymore. I know I\u2019m not innocent in terms of that I should have been the bigger person and made amends with Larry? Idk. I\u2019m just hurt and trying to move on. \n\nI know things will be okay, I know I\u2019ll be okay. I do have people who love me and are willing to help. It\u2019s just hard to know that I won\u2019t have family anymore. I\u2019m excited for the future but also so so frightened. Thanks for reading if you got this far.

Of course, this will be a great opportunity for you to influence the new tools according to your needs, and you will also get early access, benefits and rewards for providing your valuable inputs!

My parents always made 6 figures a year as far back as I can remember. We never once had a single bill go unpaid or underpaid, in fact my mom always bragged about having credited accounts for electricity, storage, and water bills. \n\nI was never taught how to save, or why we should save, or any part of budgeting in general. We ate out almost every night, and if we didn\u2019t, we had big homemade dinners of whole Cornish hens or pot roast or steaks. I distinctly remember ordering 6 oz filet mignons when I was 5 years old at the local steakhouse when we\u2019d go every couple of weeks. \n\nI had a hugely blessed childhood, and I don\u2019t take it for granted. I\u2019m so glad I can look back and remember many friends staying the night with me who got to experience a more luxurious way of life with me. We took friends to Disney world and California beaches. We bought countless Christmas presents when \u201cSanta\u201d wasn\u2019t going to make a stop at their houses. I truly was blessed. \n\nNow, I\u2019m at work almost in tears over my budget. My take home pay per year is $14,400, and when I finally factor down to monthly costs, I am in the negative by $468 every month. I am facing giving up my beloved dog, my beautiful Blue Merle Chihuahua mutt (that I bought from a widower for $50 3 years ago), and she is like my very best friend. But she is yelping and hurting, and I can\u2019t even take her to the vet this week because I have no money. I\u2019m going to have to sell my horses, the animals I put every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears into to make my dreams come true. Every spare penny has been saved to reach my horse goal, and it\u2019s all for naught now. I held almost $1,000 in medical bills in my hands last night and just bawled my eyes out. I have insurance, but it\u2019s expensive and shitty and doesn\u2019t cover anything. No animal was purchased irresponsibly. I could have never predicted this pandemic and this level of inflation. I feel so so sorry for them now, I promised them a forever home, and I can\u2019t give it to them. \n\nI have $45 to my name, and that has to last me until next Thursday when I get paid again. I just have to pray that we don\u2019t have an emergency before then, that my car stays running until then, and that I have enough dry oatmeal in the pantry to make enough meals for myself until then. \n\nThe mighty fall, and they fall hard. I had no appreciation for the life my parents gave me before, but I do now. I have a brand new appreciation for every person struggling with poverty, who had to grow up in poverty. That\u2019s where my children are now. They know we aren\u2019t rich, I\u2019ve had to tell them \u201cno\u201d on purchases for years. But for now, I\u2019m holding on to a facade for them. They get taken care of first, so they don\u2019t have to see the struggles behind the scene. \n\nI am truly praying (or just sending out well wishes and positive vibes) for everyone facing this economic crisis we are in. Dreams are being shattered, bellies are growling empty. \n\nIf I can make it out of this, I will donate as much as I can to every food bank, every toy drive, every women\u2019s and children\u2019s shelter that I ever can.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677169848.0},{"title":"Simple spreadsheet","author":"Low_Ask_88","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/11ag63e\/simple_spreadsheet\/","text":"Here is a spreadsheet that I was given a couple of years ago to help me budget.

I've been paying it off, just slowly (several years to get it down from 50.) I'm looking at ways to try and speed it up. My credit is Fair (620) - mostly due to overutilization. No other loans besides a car lease. I've been working at reducing costs and cutting back as well, just recovering from a bad period after a divorce a decade ago and living in the NY area which is hella expensive and my giving in to lifestyle creep. My credit card rates all suck (all 24ish-29%).\n\nI've gotten an offer from Achieve for a personal load for the amount for a 36 month loan that with the consolidation fee included APR comes to 23% (I assume due to poor credit.) The salesguy is pushing the fact that the CC's are all compound interest while the loan is simple as the reason to do it. \n\nBut the shitty math I've done and websites I've poked at I'm not seeing any real benefit.  The \"one payment\" issue is not important to me, just trying to pay less and faster. If the loan amount is 1170 and I pay an extra 330 each month, I'm looking at making an extra 3 payments off the loan a year, so by the 3rd year I'm finishing the loan about 8 payments early.\n\nWhereas with the CC's, if I pay the same 1500 towards the cards some calculators are saying I might pay off the card at about the same time. I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Obviously if the loan was for a much better rate it'd be a clearer decision but I've done a bunch of these and they all look the same. \n\n I'm already working two jobs to get my salary up to the 80's so I don't have room for a lot of hustles for more income; I hope to get a raise in a few months of another 5-10. \n\nAnything I'm missing?

I\u2019ve never been able to consistently keep money in my savings account. I\u2019ve had lots of financial anxiety- particularly after covid. I\u2019m VERY grateful to have found a better job that has me on a good path again, but that also leaves the potential to LOSE something. I always had this habit of only contributing towards debt and not saving anything because I was short sighted thinking I paid less interest that way. But dealing with poor job markets and how as somebody with no college degree who\u2019s trying to dig out on top of inflation $0 savings put me in a really bad spot. I don\u2019t want one month of being unemployed to mean missing bills and relying on credit.\n\nA year ago today I decided to set a very small goal. $15\/week in savings. That\u2019s ONLY for if I lose my job and either don\u2019t get unemployment or need that money to pay basic expenses it doesn\u2019t cover. Today I have $781! It\u2019s not life changing money, but it would cover my rent, utilities, minimum payments, and some groceries for a month. Having such a strict job for the money and small, manageable amount meant it was painless to save up. I actually started looking forward to dumping $30 in every 2 weeks.\n\nThis year I\u2019m upping it to $20\/week. That means- knock on wood- if I stay employed and afloat I\u2019ll have $1,819 in a years time. Maybe I\u2019ll get crazy and bump it to $25- that would put me at $2,079. Mentally knowing I have a safety net to prevent the ultimate spiral really helps. \n\nI still have debt.. more than I want to talk about. But this little habit has inspired me to take more positive steps throughout the year. I opened a second checking account only for my allowance. I started putting exactly half of my bills in a specific account right away from every paycheck. I started adding a small buffer from every check so my debt payments could be more consistent and immune to small spikes. I got a lot more serious about tracking my money and dumping everything outside of my allowance\/bills fund\/emergency $ into debt. \n\nIt still feels crushing. I\u2019ve been pinching in every direction to put 1\/4 of my not very livable wage into the debt. And car issues keep rolling in. But hey, I\u2019m in a way better spot than when I was so overwhelmed I couldn\u2019t stand to look at my bank account. Today I celebrate.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677111960.0},{"title":"Paid off 6\/7 of my CC\u2019s and 1 Loan I had. $1500 more dollars and I will be debt free other than my house.

My salary went from 40 hours a week at $22\/hr to about 25-30 hours a week at $13! Sometimes I\u2019d only get scheduled 15-20 hours a WEEK! \n\nObviously a horrible downgrade, but I decided to keep working as much as I could while I looked for a better job. During this time I accumulated some pretty serious credit card debt, approximately $8k. After approximately 6 months, I was eventually offered another job working a consistent 40 hours weekly for $17\/hr. However, when I went to submit my two-weeks notice at my current job, the manager instantly offered to match my pay and give me consistent hours. Right around this time the company was expanding and massively understaffed. My hours had also skyrocket from less than 30 to well over 40, sometimes 50-60 hours. \n\nI had a bit of resentment for being underpaid for so long so I kind of took advantage of the situation, working tons of overtime at my new $17 hourly rate and not really putting in the same effort. I started working almost exclusively graves 12-9am which are far less work in my opinion. I made my availability outside my new job\u2019s schedule. All said, I definitely consider my new job my priority. I feel more valued by my boss, I starting wage was more appropriate, I get more guidance, and I\u2019m a Shift Lead as opposed to entry level. \n\nThe problem is I\u2019m now regularly clocking in 80-90 hours a week, working 18 hours seven days a week and it\u2019s killing me, but I can\u2019t say no to the overtime. Especially now that I\u2019m able to reasonably afford my bills and eat away at debt, I\u2019m just in grind mode. Relationships are suffering, health is suffering, etc but I can\u2019t imagine going back to half my current income now. It\u2019s unsustainable. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve lost access to SNAP, which is tough. I have several people in the home who don\u2019t work enough and rarely contribute to bills at all and with sleep deprivation now a constant part of my life I\u2019m extremely irritable and resentful over how much I work, but I feel like everything will collapse if I slow down. \n\nHave any of you ever had to intervention a roommate? They\u2019re family so I don\u2019t want to kick them out, but I could honestly greatly benefit greatly from regular market rent. Even trying to insist they do more housework (since I\u2019m never home!) to make up for lack of financial contributions is a nasty argument. Whenever it\u2019s brought up they just declare that they\u2019d rather move back to the city where the job market is better. They play a lot of video games and have alcoholism (me too, but at leas I handle my shit). They have a college degree in mathematics and teaching, but refuse to teach or tutor, jobs that could easily make more money than I do. They got laid off during the tail-end of the pandemic and never really got back on their feet. I have empathy, but I feel like I\u2019m drowning and they don\u2019t care.

My husband is a veteran and qualified for a CA Veterans Home Loan (highly recommend) but buying a house was a big stretch. We finally landed better jobs in 2020 but then had a baby! Felt like we could never get traction on money and bills. I'm the one who manages bills and debt and in the last two years we racked up $13K in credit card debt with no emergency fund. Plus a surprise $2K hospital bill from the birth (a year later! ridiculous!). \n\nIn October I bought a $7 budget from Debt Free Mom and it's been a game changer for me. I've always tried monthly budgeting and it never clicked. This is pay period budgeting and for whatever reason it's helped a lot. Despite paying an insane amount of money for day care, I've managed to build up our emergency fund to $4K. Once we get to $5K I'll switch over to paying down our CC debt! \n\nI like the budget because it isn't all or nothing. I can budget way in advance for Christmas, gardening supplies, or clothes for myself or my kid. Still VERY frugal and have really learned a lot about financial planning, but I finally feel 'secure' for the first time in my adult life, even with the CC debt. I feel like we are using our better incomes SO much more responsibly. We are even planning on opening a 529 college fund for our kid! \n\nFar from being a millionaire but it's a world away from making $17K combined in 2013 and 2014.

The conventional wisdom is to pay down high interest debt first, which in many cases is the right move.\n\nHowever, we are in Poverty Finance, and conventional wisdom doesn't always apply. For example, if someone said they struggle month-to-month with cash flow, and they're about to get $5000, and the bills are as follows -\n\nCC #1 balance 8,500, 18% interest, $200 a month\n\nCC #2 balance 3,000, 10% interest, $180 a month\n\nMedical bill, 2,000, 0% interest, $300 a month\n\nConventional math says the wise thing to do is to pay down CC #1 to reduce the compound interest, but that does nothing to relieve the month-to-month bill stress. If they pay off CC#2 and the medical debt, they free up $480 a month that was sucking them dry, and can put that toward CC#1. Even if they take that monthly payment from $200 to $500, they still make a better dent in the debt and have more breathing room every month.\n\nSo, while the math may work better overall, it makes more of a lifestyle impact if the person pays off the lower interest debt.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1677163705.0},{"title":"For those of us who live near Mexico\u2026","author":"thefinalgoat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/povertyfinance\/comments\/1194lmz\/for_those_of_us_who_live_near_mexico\/","text":"You can get 7 oz. of Mexican pasta (brand La Moderna) for 48\u00a2.

I already know my AC will need replaced when summer comes. Now my dog has developed a growth in her mouth and it had to be removed for quality of life reasons. It cost \\~$1,400. She's around 12 or 13 years old and she's an amazing dog - the best temperament and personality. She's given us the best years of her life and she deserves to be cared for and loved in her old age. I feel awful because I find myself resenting her. I look at her and all I see is how much longer it will take to get back to where we were financially - like all the work I've done was pointless. All I can think is she might live another 5 or 6 years (aside from the benign growth she is very healthy - good joints and teeth, etc...) and how many similar surgeries she might need, and I kind of hate her. I feel like a bad person for thinking it and feeling the way I do. She really is a good dog.  \n\n\n It's like money took a part of my life that used to bring me so much joy and comfort when I felt overwhelmed (emotionally and financially) and twisted it into something painful and overwhelming.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the kind responses. And also for the harsh ones too. In a way they all served a purpose. I feel guilty for resenting her and the harsh comments made me wallow in that feeling bc I felt like I deserved it.  I don't really hate her,  but it's a very complicated and unexpected series of feelings for me.\n\nEdit 2: I should also add- I've had to pay large vet bills for her in the past and it never made me feel this way. So people saying 'Don't have pets\/kids if you can't take care of them. It's not always sunshine and rainbows etc...' -  slow your roll.

A 2000 Mercedes Benz C280, with about 212k miles, will be about $2,400.  A 2007 Subaru Outback, with 193k miles, would be about $4,500.   Now, I've been fortunate that I've been able to save money that I could pay for either one in full, with no payments.  \n\nIf I get the more expensive vehicle, I will be unable to pay for my 2022 taxes.  If I get the cheaper vehicle, I would be risking that I could get by for the next 6 months without any major repairs. \n\nMind you, I use these for deliveries.  \n\nCheap vs reliable.  What would you choose?\n\nUPDATE:  After the overflow of data in here, I decided to up my budget for repairs, which turned out to be the wiser move, because I got word back from mechanic I use that the timing belt broke, so he ordered a timing belt kit to take care of all the little things that go with it, and the total? $1206.  Little more than I wanted to spend, but looking at the alternative, it's cheaper than trying to buy another vehicle, because he used car market is still just ridiculous.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1676943353.0},{"title":"My doctor advices I go to hospital for mental health but ultimately it\u2019s my choice (not involuntary hospitalization).
