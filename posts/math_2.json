        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am working on a project with compound Poisson processes in an SDE setting and I am hoping someone here can answer my question. I have already seen compound Poisson processes with a mean reverting drift but I am hoping to take my project a bit further.\n\nSuppose I know that at certain time frames (say from 13.00 to 14.00 or something) my arrival rates (or drift) Lambda(t)  dt changes over time. Suppose Lambda(t) = t\\*lambda, or to make it even more exotic: Lambda(t) = t\\^2 \\* lambda. I believe the 'stationary increments' property of a Poisson process now gets violated. However, is there still a way for me te create such a framework in an SDE setting?\n\nI haven't found a good explanation online why this can('t) work so I am hoping someone here might point me in the right direction.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I always excelled in it, starting from elementary school, but high school really kindled my passion by introducing me to geometry and proofs. The process of playing with abstract principles to derive further conclusions, see how they all combine, intersect and interrelate to each other, was extremely fun and intellectually fascinating. \n\nBut now I'm a math major and... I feel like this interest had been sapped out. Some of the lectures are interesting, but none so to the degree of making me eager to get to my desk and start solving my homework problems, like high school geometry did for me. During the first semester, I had an unrelated mental health crisis, and maybe it served to dampen my general curiosity, but I'm afraid that's not all the story. I just couldn't perceive the beauty and elegance that so attracted me in the past. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this situation before? Do you have in mind some book or movie which could help revive my enthusiasm? Or some other possible solution?\n\nThanks ahead.",

        "text": "[ Sing to the tune of Mathematical Pi (American Pie) ]\n\nA long long time ago, long before the Tree of Time and things like jasmine tea...  The United Republic were full of pros, and a question resting on Guru Laghima's mind was... what is the circumference of an egg custard?\n\nBut they were spread among the lion turtles, and it ranks among their highest temples. They meditated for years, and confirmed one of their kind Zaheer... It can be certain if they flied, when their maneuverability was theorized... but gravity amongst them defied- the day they discovered Pi... They were thinking Pi, Pi, the celestial Pi. 3.141592, 6535897, 93238462\n, 64338327 (not rounded)...\n\nWell this kind of Pi is different than most, it hasn't got arrows or slice like swords... and that's how it's always been. We keep reincarnating its decimal places, mastering the elements through the faces... but we'll never reach the end...  So why the fascination with, a light spirit whose name's just a myth? When's the speculation, for next sequel occasions? \n\nIt might have something to do with the stars, to determine the fate of the Avatar... but that's just a guess about the way things are, regarding the precision of Pi... I am pondering Pi, Pi, the celestial Pi. 3.141592, 6535897, 93238462, 64338327. \n\nNow I feel that Raava should mention, Pi is applicable in any dimension. At least as far the portals goes. If there were no Pi we'd be missing things like Katara's necklace and the Earth Kings, and spirits such as Tui... and La...\n\nThe animals in their bestial wrath, subjugated by hysterical laughs. Eclipses have Pi in them too, water and fire benders knew. You can see Pi in almost everything, it's in Ba Sing Se's outer ring... and it's also in Sokka's slings and other things, and that's why... it's important to know Pi. You should memorize Pi, Pi, the mathematical Pi. 3.141592, 6535897, 93238462, 64338327...\n\nOnce one night Korra had a dream, that Pi was gone because of Vaatu's beam... and all her past lives had disappeared. Can you imagine a world like that? Cycles are broken and Earth is flat. It's the combination of all the elements we feared. 'Twas a nightmare of chaotic destruction, one that gave her hallucinations - oh wait I mean illusions. Kuvira bribed her with a collusion, but she escaped and now she's free... to sing the virtue of Pi... Pi, Pi, the mathematical Pi. 3.141592, 6535897, 93238462, 64338327.",

        "text": "Ok so in highschool we are taught that the B-W theorem is stated like this:\n\nLet f:[a,b]‚ÜíR be a continuous function, if f(a)f(b)&lt;0 ‚àÉc‚àà(a,b) s.t f(c)=0.\n\nI‚Äôm now self studying Real Analysis and the B-W in actually states that each infinite bounded sequence in R^n has a convergent subsequence (but lets just consider n=1 for now). \n\nIn actuality the theorem in our high school book is called Bolzano‚Äôs theorem which makes sense since this is the initial idea Bolzano had and then Weierstrass came and made it more rigorous. But our teacher did mention that this was called the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and he doesn‚Äôt now why they cut his name off (I might‚Äôve just found the reason but him saying that means that there is a connection between the two statements).\n\nThe first thought that might come up might be that this looks like the intermediate value theorem and you‚Äôd obviously be correct. In fact, that‚Äôs how we prove the IVT, by letting \nœÜ:[a,b]‚ÜíR with x‚Ü¶f(x)-c and applying the Bolzano‚Äôs Theorem for œÜ in [a,b]. Which is weird because I think in general that version of the theorem is widely considered as a corollary of the IVT. What proof do we have for Bolzano‚Äôs theorem you may ask? None.\n\nI can see some similarity but I can‚Äôt exactly see why this is a special case of the B-W. Why does that initial idea by Bolzano imply that every infinite bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. The bound makes since it is equivalent to saying that ‚àÉM&gt;0 s.t -M&lt;=a_n&lt;=M for an n in N but the subsequence converging isn‚Äôt immediately clear to me so that‚Äôs what this question can be boiled to.",

Of course, it's never too early for interested sophomore and junior undergraduates to start preparing and thinking about going to graduate schools, too!\n\n---\n\nWe have many wonderful volunteers who are dedicating their time to answering your questions.  Their focuses span a wide variety of interesting topics, including harmonic analysis, algebraic geometry, statistics, and Stochastic Analysis/Mathematical Physics.\n\nWe also have a handful of volunteers that are postdocs or have recently finished graduate school/postdocs and can speak to what happens after you earn your degree.  We also have some panelists who are now in industry/other non-math fields.\n\n---\n\nThese panelists have special red flair.  However, if you're a graduate student or if you've received your graduate degree already, feel free to chime in and answer questions as well!  The more perspectives we have, the better!\n\nAgain, the panel will be running over the course of the next two weeks, so feel free to continue checking in and asking questions!\n\nFurthermore, one of our former panelists, /u/Darth_Algebra has kindly contributed [this excellent presentation about applying to graduate schools and applying for funding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1niqlzySV4JZGFFbzVjV1RaOEE/edit?usp=sharing).  Many schools offer similar advice, and the [AMS](http://www.ams.org/profession/career-info/grad-school/grad-school) has a similar page. \n\n---\n\n**Here is a link to the [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/21u1ix/rmath_graduate_school_panel/), [second](http://redd.it/2kh7et), [third](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/30t9gn/rmaths_third_graduate_school_panel/), [fourth](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/49egld/rmaths_fourth_graduate_school_panel/)**, **[fifth](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/5e5d91/rmaths_fifth_graduate_school_panel/)**, **[sixth](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/60hbdz/rmaths_sixth_graduate_school_panel/)**, **[seventh](https://redd.it/75ajb7)**, **[eighth](https://redd.it/8276ho)**, **[ninth](https://redd.it/9oeen0)**, **[tenth](https://redd.it/azv7ac)**, **[11th](https://redd.it/dl2ms2)**, [12th](https://redd.it/fks01d), and [13th](https://redd.it/jbqbre), **[14th](https://redd.it/m5n9sb)**, **[15th](https://redd.it/qkh3yo)**, **[16th](https://redd.it/taipd7)**, and **[17th](https://redd.it/y6euip)** Graduate School Panels, to get an idea of what this will be like.",

Since the points about which each triangle is rotated are dynamic and dependent on the rotation of the previous triangle, how  do I go about doing this?  \n\n\nI feel like I need a transformation matrix, but feels like it 's complicated. How should I think about this?  \n\n\nThis is the exact simulation I'm looking to replicate. [https://www.geogebra.org/m/gvauh2qS](https://www.geogebra.org/m/gvauh2qS)  \nEven here every rotation has been hard coded to exhaust all possibilities for n. They have hard coded the rotation for 8 vertices, which is the max for n.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nThis is part vent, part request for advice/help. Please feel free to remove this if this doesn't fit here.\n\nI'm a grad student coming from a biological sciences background and do some population modeling. I felt like I needed to know the math better (not just from gleaning from textbooks) and want to make more complex models, which led me to take this grad-level applied PDEs course. However, the last time I took a math course was integral calculus close to a decade ago, and I'm struggling like hell right now. Maybe I'm flying too close to the sun.  I'm so sure my professor thinks I'm an absolute moron, but I guess that's besides the point. (Feels bad, though.) \n\nIn class, it seems to make sense. On problem sets and on exams, I'm just lost. It feels like a mixture of lack of confidence (so I'm constantly changing things, even if it *was* the right way to do the problem/having trouble starting), lack of background, and also my brain poisoning concepts with my understanding of the world that's been solidified through the lens of a biologist. Every time I get a bad mark, I tell myself that I'm doing ok (shockingly I'm still passing the class) for someone who never took any of the classes in between integral calculus and PDEs (e.g., vector calculus, advanced calculus, series, analysis...), but I just want it to click. :/ I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Do you have tips on how to overcome this? I've talked a bit with the professor to clarify some things, but the professor's office hours are when I have to TA and the last time I spoke to them, they said something to the effect of \"Oh, so you do have a reason for taking this course.\" (Thanks, dude.) \n\nAm I a lost cause? Any and all advice is appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm using \"non-trivial\" and \"sequence\" in a very loose sense here. For instance, something like \"1/2 unit steps in the direction (-1,0) until you are out of the set\" would be trivial. And a sequence would just be an ordered collection of points, or features, or other patterns, where there's a rule for going from one to the next. \n\nThe reason I'm asking this is that nearly every sequence like that is infinite. Follow a branch point, there will be an infinite sequence of branch points no matter which way you go. Follow the sequence of smaller and smaller bulbs towards the center, also infinitely many bulbs. Are there any sequences of features you can trace which terminate at some point, or at least converge to a simple geometric shape as the sequence continues (well, taking smaller segments as you approach (-2,0) seems to converge to a straight line, so that seems like an example of the latter)?",
