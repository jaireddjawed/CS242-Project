With nothing grouped by category, only listed in order of date posted.\n\nThe \"Latest\" link still exists, but now the page that loads includes ALL postings, articles, techniques, features.  Which is nice, but when I am looking for recipe inspiration, I want to stick strictly to recipes.\n\n\nAnyone have a trick for achieving this?\n\nAs I was writing this, I see I can use the search bar and by searching for an empty search bar, I can hit recipes and see a list of recipes.  Which is a nice work around, but ideally I would still rather see the photo style layout the recipe page and \"latest\" button will show.  And on closer inspection, it doesn't seem to sort entirely by date posted.  So you can see a lot of recipes, but it's a random assortment.   I enjoy the time based sorting as it produces recipes that are more timely for the season.\n\n\nAnyway, if anyone has a trick to doing that, I would love to hear it.\n\nThank you.",

Just a few questions from anyone who's tried it:\n\n- my eggplant is a globular pinkish/greenish/striped eggplant (maybe [Graffiti](http://i2.wp.com/paleo202.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paleo-Eggplant-Parmesan-Paleo202-5.jpg)?) - will that work as well and with the same handling as the Chinese or Japanese named in the recipe?\n- I've seen hoisin sauce as a non-exact, but still tasty substitution for doubanjiang sauce. I do like hoisin, and don't have doubanjiang. Will this substitution work (in terms of making a tasty dish), or should I make the trip out to my Asian grocery to see if they have the doubanjiang?\n- how's the spiciness level as written? I like spice, but authentic Sichuan can be seriously hot.\n\n(I'm not actually vegan or vegetarian, so any suggestions don't need to take that into consideration)\n\nThanks!",

It stuck to the board, the roller, bench scraper, and damn near everywhere. Flour all over the place. Kept tearing when I tried to transfer it. Just a disaster.\n\nI know it's not the recipes fault, but I hate when I watch videos of people doing it so effortlessly. I never get them right. \n\nWorking with dough is a pain in the ass. ",

I had planned on doing something else with the pork shoulder initially, so it was successively marinated in Shoyu Koji and then gochujang. I was missing some of the peppers called for in the recipe, but I hoped the korean spice paste would even that out. I did try to get a little bit of a sear on the meat before pressure cooking, but i'm not sure that made much of a difference. Easily the equal of any slow-cooked or dutch oven pork i've made. ",
