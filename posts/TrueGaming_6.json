        "text": "For a long time I had the notion that video games were not meant to  have complex writing and that the best RPG would be a game emphasizing its gameplay. In my well, I thought Morrowind was perhaps the best RPG that had ever been made, it offered so much content, had a great atmosphere and a lot of gameplay mechanics that made it into a massive game. I held The Elder Scrolls series as a reference in video games, but there's one thing I never liked about them: I often just skipped most of the dialogue and found it boring. How strange, I shouldn't be bothered by text when I properly enjoy reading books, so why is it that I disliked walls of text in video games?\n\nI found the answer recently by playing my first CRPG games. I started my adventure with the infamous Planescape Torment and I was just absolutely hooked. I realised writing in video games can be taken to a whole new level and perhaps questioned the games I had been playing before. If they had writing like this, would I really have skipped it or did I skip it because I was tired of pointless infodump and generic walls of text? It'd been a long time since I had launched any RPG with a lot of text, however, as I had spent the previous years mostly playing gameplay oriented games. After P:T, I decided to play Fallout 1 and 2 and I think I have fallen in love with CRPGs after this. Fallout 2 and P:T ended up being both in my list of favourite games within one month, what an incredible gaming time.\n\nThere's something else that I did not mention before, I have never finished a TES game before. They're simply too long and padded with content which doesn't really encourage me to finish it. I wasn't hooked to the story like I was in P:T and Fallout, I didn't really care about finishing it. Therefore, I decided to replay Fallout 3 (which I hadn't finished but played years ago) in order to complete my Fallout adventure. Oh boy... I realised the dialogue is simply disastrous. A lot of the text is just way too generic and completely useless, it is pure and utter padding with not a single point. NPCs don't have an introduction paragraph which gives you an idea of who they are and information specific to that person, they simply have a useless one-liner which doesn't tell you anything and then you're given dialogue choices.\n\nThe same dialogue choices keep repeating themselves for an entire down and you even to waste time scrolling every single time to see if there's a special choice or if the character has literally no point existing within the game. Every dialogue is one or two lines, then you are given a completly meaningless choice which barely influences dialogue. The stat checks are ridiculously bad and often just quote obvious things as an intelligence / speech check. I just started ignoring most of the dialogue because it was plain horrible, and checking my journal to see a summary of quests. That's legitimately the only relevant information they give you, the NPCs are plain robots with the purpose of giving quests. There is no lore, no identity to the characters or if there is, very superficial ones and often very cheap humour such as the quirky woman making a survival book. I have no words to describe it other than ATROCIOUS.\n\nI now understand better why I often didn't care at all for dialogue in games. I'm sure they were probably terrible. Games like Planescape or Disco Elysium really take writing to a whole new level. But it doesn't even have to be that good, it doesn't have to be verbose, you don't need insanely complex lore. There are tons of games out there with very simple dialogue yet they remain enjoyable. I enjoy Earthbound inspired games because they build an atmosphere through very simple interactions with NPCs and no complexity shown on the surface at all. You'll get simple dialogue for the main story and you won't ever expect NPCs to speak more than one or two lines, yet those lines are always worth the read and they all build into an atmosphere. Fallout 3 can't even do that and its dialogue is an absolute waste of time.",

I play in the top 1% of the games I put my time into (hundreds of hours) but can never quite push into the top .01%.\n\nFor me, it seems to be inconsistency. One day, I play perfectly, the next there’s just something off. My reactions are slower, decisions are bad (it seems), and I can’t predict what others are doing as well (it seems). I say “it seems” because of the fact I play FPS, mechanics are so important that my off days could fully be down to me just missing my shots while making good decisions.\n\nWith all of that said, Ive narrowed down my performance to my sleep, but as I do research I feel like my body reacts differently than most people. All the health gurus say anything under 8 hours of sleep reduces performance, and as time goes on it’ll only get worse. For me, 7 hours seems to be the sweet spot. Anything over, I am slow, anything under and I’m too tired.\n\nOne theory I have is when I under sleep I’m waking up after 7 hours of sleep in the right cycle, so I wake up more alert. If that isn’t the case then it just seems I perform worse with 8 hours + of sleep, does that make sense?\n\nWhat do you guys think? How does sleep effect you?",

My question is, why are people so obsessed with having real rosters? I am a fan of these players as well, but I would much rather manage a fantasy team full of people I can build up and don't have an attachment to outside of the game. I would definitely not let the lack of a players name in my game make me not buy something, that is just silly to me. Real life is playing out in front of you, what is the point of wanting to manage a real person in a video game??? Makes no sense to me.\n\nI also don't see why people care so much about licensing and whether or not their favorite team is available to play... Am I the only one who has an imagination and would rather play a 100% fictional league? Even when I buy a WWE game, I create my own show, my own roster, everything I create myself and I don't use ANY actual wrestlers within the game. Fantasy is 100% better than real life, why would you want to emulate real life in a video game when you can have a plethora of options that makes the game 10x better than real life?\n\nIs it just a kid thing? Kids like to play as and emulate their idols? Because I can understand that. \n\nI just don't understand why people buy Madden or Fifa each and every year for the updated rosters when, I have never cared for real players in my video games. I would rather have a fun experience for 15+ in game seasons than to play a game for updated rosters. It literally makes zero sense. I still have fun going back to my emulated Madden 06 and continuing my career mode that is in 2018 now with the fictional players that I love than I do from booting up a year old madden that crashes every month and destroys your save data. I don't even mean to start ranting about EA but their games have become so bad. Madden 05 and 06 are amazing, the game they been putting out for the last 8+ years is god awful.",

Unfortunately, while on vacation to my Paternal grandmother's house, my Maternal grandmother feel ill, and then was admitted to the hospital. She had a stroke a couple weeks back, and after a couple of days in the hospital, she had another stroke, leaving half of her body paralyzed, and then finally her organs shut down and she passed away. This not only caused grief, but also my parents being unable to afford the game i was looking forward to playing.\n\nI completely understand their situation and would never ask them for the game in such a time, but i though maybe some kind stranger on reddit would be able to help me out. I wish to play the game escape from tarkov. Escape from Tarkov is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video game in development by Battlestate Games, The game is set in the fictional Norvinsk region, where a war is taking place between two private military companies (United Security \"USEC\" and the Battle Encounter Assault Regiment \"BEAR\"). Players join matches called \"raids\" in which they fight other players and bots for loot and aim to survive and escape.\n\nI have always loved sim games like this, and have been quite an avid fan of the STALKER series, and after looking at this game for a couple years, i had decided to purchase it. I love the realism, the actual fear for your life that this game gives you. The multiple weapon options, and the overall atmosphere of the game is absolutely brilliant. Recently, the new map streets of tarkov has been absolutely what i have been looking for, and i have been wanting to experience this type of in game combat, that requires a tactical, realistic approach, instead of the constant moving, jumping, etc of games such as call of duty or battlefield.\n\nThank you for reading, and i hope you have a good day!\n\nGame - [Escape From Tarkov](https://www.g2a.com/escape-from-tarkov-edge-of-darkness-limited-edition-key-global-i10000156317002?gname=f5cd11c8aa#offers)",

        "text": " If you look at the games from the 'olden days', there was a very specific design philosophy at play: **you have to choose which content you get to experience and which you don't.**\n\nClassic  RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout, Morrowind, Knights of the Old  Republic, Gothic, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines etc. feature this  in abundance. Basically, you have to commit to some choices - whether  it's character's class or race, the result of a quest, faction alignment  or just skills. And all of them were equally valid. All of them were  full-fledged content, produced with equal care, almost like multiple  games in one. In Gothic when you joined one camp, you totally locked  yourself from experiencing the game from the point of view of other camps. In Morrowind your race doesn't just affect the stats, but how the entire world reacts to you. Similarly, choosing your vampire kin in Bloodlines basically defined what kind of gameplay will you have - whether you even get to talk to most NPCs or not. In KotOR you could even kill **an entire playable character**, which was insane for its time - and still is.\n\nBut **the bigger and more expensive games become, the less we get to see that.**  The problem reached its peak probably in Cyberpunk 2077, where almost  every 'choice' you're being presented with is purely illusionary. In Ubisoft  or Sony blockbuster games, different \"choices\" somehow never feature any  substancial, unique gameplay consequences, and resort just to difference in dialogue or meaningless items you get. Companies these days are *terrified* of producing content that all of players won't experience. They basically think that **content you don't play is money lost**. Which seems like a logical thing at first, until you realize that **it's the things you** ***don't*** **do that give value to the things you do**. Being a mage is special *because* you can't fight like a raging barbarian. Refusing money from a quest reward is special *because*  you could have done otherwise. If refusing money leads to the same  outcome of NPC giving it to you anyway, because of how noble you are -  then your actions never mattered. When everything is special - nothing  is.\n\nI wanted to end on some  positive note, but honestly I can't find it. The more people in suits get to power, the less interesting games we get. I don't think the old ways of game design will return - all we can do is cherish they ever happened.",

        "text": "This is a complicated topic and I don’t think there’s an objectively right answer, but I really haven’t seen it discussed much if at all in gaming circles.\n\nTo be clear, under normal circumstances I would not want to blame or punish the citizens of a country for the actions of their government, but Russia and Ukraine have both moved to a total war footing. Sadly, I believe that the war is most likely to continue until one side runs out of resources to sustain its war economy. In this context, and with Russian and Belarussian game studios often employing high level officials with direct links to the Russian government, and having financial investments from the same, a portion of their income is definitely going directly into the Russian war economy, before you even get to whatever taxes they may continue to pay to the Russian government.\n\nI'm also concerned that with Russia so heavily sanctioned, their ties with supposedly international game studios may give them a potential route to dodge sanctions and launder money.\n\nSo let's look at some of these studios and their context. The biggest example in the news today of the issues I’m bringing up is Atomic Heart by Moscow-founded developer Mundfish.\n\nHere is one Ukrainian’s perspective on the game and developer: [https://www.thegamer.com/russia-invasion-kyiv-atomic-heart-mundfish-blocked-twitter/](https://www.thegamer.com/russia-invasion-kyiv-atomic-heart-mundfish-blocked-twitter/)\n\nPolygon goes into some details about just how culturally Russian the new game is in its preview here: [https://www.polygon.com/23553661/atomic-heart-preview-russia-mundfish-soviet-fps](https://www.polygon.com/23553661/atomic-heart-preview-russia-mundfish-soviet-fps)\n\nAnd here is an article about the developer’s financial and personnel ties to the Russian government: [https://ain.capital/2023/01/17/atomic-heart-will-be-released-in-february-its-a-russian-game-backed-by-ex-gazprom/](https://ain.capital/2023/01/17/atomic-heart-will-be-released-in-february-its-a-russian-game-backed-by-ex-gazprom/)\n\nYou also have incidents like this within the game itself: [https://twitter.com/eywind/status/1615334349750300672](https://twitter.com/eywind/status/1615334349750300672) which certainly contribute to a hostile atmosphere in-game for Ukrainians and others who have cause to directly fear Russian attacks.\n\nSadly of course this goes far beyond Atomic Heart and Mundfish. Let’s look at Owlcat Studios, whose games I’m a huge fan of and whose developers seem to be genuinely lovely nerdy people. Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader is due to come out Q3 this year, which is of course a Western IP, and Owlcat certainly employs an international team. But prior to the war they were de facto headquartered in Moscow. They’ve supposedly moved the bulk of their staff to Cyprus, which as we'll see is a bit of a recurring trend. They also, like Mundfish, have been invested in by GEM Capital with its ties to Gazprom, Russia’s giant state-owned oil and gas company, as well as Mail Ru, a Russian technology company which also has explicit ties to the Russian government. [https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/newly-independent-owlcat-games-raises-1m-for-new-unannounced-project/](https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/newly-independent-owlcat-games-raises-1m-for-new-unannounced-project/)\n\nYou also have companies like Wargaming, originally headquartered in Belarus, which runs World of Tanks and World of Warships. Wargaming had a major presence in Russia, but has supposedly moved all or most of its staff over to, again, Cyprus. Now, as someone who’s moved countries a couple of times, there’s a huge amount of difficulty and expense involved. The idea that all of these major studios with large staffs have moved them all out of Russia is on its face just not logistically plausible. Even if they did, there’s no evidence they’ve severed their financial links with Russia. As far as I know, no Russian company has made any formal statements against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere is how Wargaming supposedly responded almost a year ago now: [https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-tanks-developer-wargaming-leaves-russia-and-belarus](https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-tanks-developer-wargaming-leaves-russia-and-belarus)\n\nI’ve seen no followup from the gaming press, no interviews with employees, no real scrutiny of what this company claims to have done, at all.\n\nNow from a pro-Russian perspective we have this: [https://realnoevremya.com/articles/6845-game-developers-leaving-russia-to-survive](https://realnoevremya.com/articles/6845-game-developers-leaving-russia-to-survive)\n\nThe Russian games economy has definitely taken a major financial hit, many high level staff have moved out of the country to Cyprus and Kazakstan among other places, and they’re seeking more Russian government financial support. It’s also clear that the companies that have left are still considered by Russia to be Russian companies, an important part of the Russian economy. There are even proposals for forming a sort of Russian EA to prop up the market and project soft power abroad: [https://www.thegamer.com/russia-considers-publisher-ea-revive-games-industry/](https://www.thegamer.com/russia-considers-publisher-ea-revive-games-industry/)\n\nFor me, at the risk of invoking Godwin’s Law, I take the perspective of an American in 1940 looking at buying a German board game. The board game is in English, it says the company is headquartered in Switzerland. But the company was founded in Berlin, it has investments from Hitler’s government, and some members of its board have direct links to prominent Nazi party members. What would it take for me to feel comfortable buying that game from that company?\n\nI think it would need to divest itself of those investments, fire those members of staff with government connections, and prove its genuine independence.\n\nIt could do this in part by publicly denouncing the invasions of its mother country and donating a portion of profits to supporting that country's victims. It would also need to offer transparency and make staff available for interviews.\n\nHere and now none of this has been done, and while I’m sympathetic to wanting to “keep politics out of games” or to support game developers we have a positive relationship with, I think the gaming community has really been turning a blind eye to this thorny issue.\n\nI also feel that the gaming press has been a bit negligent here. It's clear that our big Western publishers clearly have a financial interest in not rocking the boat and potentially delaying or derailing projects they’ve invested some big money into.\n\nAs things stand, I believe that I have a moral responsibility to advocate for a general boycott of these studios and games until the Russian invasion of Ukraine is over, whatever I think of the artistic ideas, premises, or individual developers involved in the products.\n\nHow about you?",

The acting was amazing and the choices you get to make actually make a difference in how the game will play out.\n\nIf I could tell anyone who has put the genre off like I did to try it, I would in a heart beat, yes it won't be for everyone but I definitely think more people should give it a go! \n\nAnyone else play them and if so, any good recommendations for the genre? 😁🙌",

        "text": "I've been thinking lately about the implementation of boss phase transitions. My examples will be drawn from From Software's Souls-like games because I have a lot of experience with them, but the points I mention should apply to any game with boss phase transitions.\n\nMany of the community's favourite boss phase transitions have cutscenes (e.g. Ludwig, Twin Princes, Godrick). It's easy to see why. A cutscene allows the developer to make the phase transition more cinematic. The boss can speak multiple lines of dialogue, and the phase transition can be drawn out for dramatic effect in a way that wouldn't be possible if the player could attack the boss the whole time.\n\nHowever, many of my favourite boss phase transitions are the ones without cutscenes (e.g. Soul of Cinder, Margit, Radagon). These phase transitions are often marked by a big attack, a change in the music, and maybe one voice line. I think these are my favourites because they're not skippable. Godrick's phase transition is cool, but I'm not going to watch it more than a handful of times. On my 10th attempt against Godrick, I'm just going to skip the cutscene so I can get on with the fight. With non-cutscene phase transitions, I experience them every time. I've heard Margit's \"well, thou art of passing skill\" so many times it's burned into my memory.\n\n(You also have to watch unskippable cutscenes every time, but most gamers will quickly grow annoyed with those. I'm sure you've all seen memes about unskippable cutscenes before and during bossfights. Non-cutscene phase transitions are short and don't take control away from the player.)\n\nWhat do you guys prefer? Boss phase transitions with cutscenes or without cutscenes?",

I would like to find out if there are any negative consequences and how for example different age groups review their gaming.\n\nThe questions used in this survey belong to standardized measuring instruments, which my research group uses but didn't create - I am well aware that the wording in some of this questions can seem  odd - but it would mean a lot to me, if you could overlook that and help me out anyway!

As you can guess I used to be able to play for 5-8 hrs almost daily, but recently I had to get an extra job to make some much needed $$$. Now I just come back home with a couple of hrs daily tired and burnt out af, and just when I pop in to a game it doesn't feel good /satisfying anymore. League is just too toxic and can only play a couple of matches before its time to put the light out and even in those couple if matches its mostly a loss streak, so cant really enjoy it. POE feels to grindy after 30mins.\n\nSo as the title says are there any games out there that can be played casually and is multiplayer, cause I really love the social aspect of it. I games I was thinking of are: Destiny 2; is the f2p version enough for a while, the expansions are looking like they will drop a nuke on my wallet. Lost Ark; bought the bronze founders just for the cat, played for the campaign, but never got to any content past mommy Abrelshud (imo the English name for her is really bad), I remember the island thing being timed which really sucks. I thought of FF14, but not sure I would get into it cause the campaign takes so long. Similar to D2 I was thinking of Guild Wars 2? how is it? Heard really good things about it and the Legendary skins look awesome. Any and all suggestions are welcome.",

Just know that I'm not doing this for edge, brownie points, or anything like that. I am doing this because above all else, I want the truth. I want to expose the truth behind what happened during that year, and how Scott Cawthon rolled a Goddamn 20 and got away with zero reputational consequences whatsoever, as people blindly surrounded him like a Greek phalanx and spread lies and deciet in their wake.\n\nOne of the biggest claims people make, overall, is that Scott Cawthon was \"bullied for having an opinion\", and was \"viciously attacked by the twitter outrage mob\".\n\nNo, no he was not. What you need to understand is that opinions end where politics begin, particularly those of human and civil rights. His \"opinion\" ultimately, at best, has him valuing the economy over the rights of what make up a large portion of his fandom, including his LGBT+ fans and his female fans, among other marginalized people.\n\nHe donates to conservatives, including infamous far right loons like Mitch McConnel and Donald Trump, if I recall correctly. These two ALONE are already enough of a bright red flaming flag, but the fact is, their policies are not just economic, not that their economic views are good either (theyre also hard capitalists who won't even support social welfare), but that's besides the point. Conservatives, by and large, tend to stagnate and regress society, and were responsible largely for the removal of Roe Vs Wade and making the issue of abortion a state-by-state fustercluck that harms women to this day.\n\nThey are also against trans rights, gay rights, LGBT+ and interracial marriage, so on and so forth, and have done much to try slowing and reversing the tide of progress. Now, why do I mention all of this? Because I wanted to make it clear that we were upset with Scott because he donated to awful, disgusting individuals who want to erase and invalidate many people, many people who are innocent and again, part of Scott's fanbase. Of COURSE they're gonna feel betrayed that the guy and franchise they loved is being partially used to support awful politicians trying to screw them over!\n\nI will be the first to say, mind you, that yes, there were SOME INDIVIDUALS who took things too far and muddied the situation. SOME individuals went on a blood frenzy and threatened him and his household, and that's not okay whatsoever. However, to take those individuals and act like we're all like them is frankly dishonest and atrocious, and completely derails what we're trying to tell you. You can't just take the actions of a few crazy people and make us all out to be insane! You need to actually listen to us and try to understand the situation, instead of flocking to whatever opportunistic anti-SJW channel you like to listen to.\n\nThen there are the other Youtubers, who either failed to respond at all, or had pathetic responses. MatPat played enlightened centrist, Dawko was too busy gawking uselessly in his video, and Markiplier, the Goddamn KING of FNAF himself, didn't even say a word!\n\nWow guys, thanks for helping the situation with your clearly insightful and powerful commentary -\\_-'\n\nBut, that's about where I'll end it here. I just wanted to give it a shot, to at least find ONE subreddit who will not only keep this up and online, but one that will actually heed my words on the issue.",

This lets it run at 60 fps on the series x, ps5 and even the series s.  Despite using ray tracing global illumination.

        "text": "I don't just want to make some blind fanboy hype post, but I also do. Hopefully this bridges the gap.\n\nThe original Dead Space is an utterly repellent and irredeemable work of art, and if you're a fan of horror like me, you'll know that's not an insult. It rivals film classics like *The Thing* and *The Fly* in its appalling desolation, wherein even moments of levity or optimism are simply a ploy to draw you in so that it might hurt you further, a cruel joke. It appears to exist for no other purpose than to repel and alarm and ultimately destroy you. Any feeling of empowerment is derived from a brutal animal desperation only; any beauty from depraved fascinations, and any grandiosity from a realization of your insignificance. I often find it useful to conceptualize horror and suspense in fiction as being distinct from one another, both having different aims. Suspense is the feeling: \"HOLY SHIT, I MIGHT DIE!!!\" Horror is the feeling: \"Every body is going to die...\" Dead Space rips that distinction to shreds: Yes, of course you will die, but just watch - even knowing that your life is nothing, a delusional and pathetic creature like you will do everything in your power to survive. At least the Necromorphs are mindless. Like *The Conspiracy against the Human Race*, it's a work of spiritual desertion and derangement: if you find yourself at home in it, you've either gone insane or utterly numb, and if you don't, you're left with nothing to hold onto but the most base of impulses - fear and the children of fear: anger and disgust.\n\nThe game is almost intolerable, especially on one's first playthrough. Even cynicism crumbles in the face of its atmosphere. I once watched a friend play it - at first, she mocked the supposedly cartoonish actions of the crewmates Isaac stumbles upon over the course of his journey. If they aren't killed by something else in front of you, almost all are unhinged to the point of psychosis by the effects of the Marker, and either commits suicide or dies from, presumably, a combination of stress, exhaustion, and physical trauma, shortly after you enter the room. They were over-the-top, she said, campy and ridiculous. Towards the end of the game, you encounter a woman slumped against a crate, cackling maniacally. Almost as if her hand has a mind of its own, it raises a gun to her chin and blows her brains out. My friend watched this in a state of solemn silence. After so many hours of gruesome violence and bone-chilling tension, the game forces you to understand such things. Yes, over time, having ground your way through enough biomass to rival certain real-world genocides, you are desensitized, but not into dispassion or glee. It numbs you into stupefaction. On repeat playthroughs, this effect is less potent, but, at least when I play it with headphones, even though I know what is going to happen, even though the jumpscares are mapped firmly in my mind, I have trouble playing it for more than an hour at a time. This game is *fucked*. [Like Mike Tyson reverently declared of Muhammad Ali](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zxWFVtTp6ew), the game is \"mean and evil,\" it will \"take you in deep waters and drown you.\" I am sure that, to some people, all of this makes me sound like a milquetoast weakling who probably doesn't even love horror, or worse, a melodramatic exaggerator, but something about this game truly distresses me, worms its way into my brain like a parasite for the sole purpose of offending through disdain every sane sensibility I cling to in daily life, something somehow simultaneously malicious and vacant, wicked and dispassionate. Maybe it is everything about this game that affects me this way. Even the title screen is a godforsaken abomination. \n\nDead Space is such a triumph of cosmic horror that I almost can't believe the effect it has on me was deliberately confected by a team of professionals who lead normal, productive lives full of happiness and connection. (The [credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bmg2QVgpOk) are six minutes long!) You would think that *some* kind of whimsy and mirth would slip through the cracks. Most works which require this scale of collaboration only attain such a level of bleakness and grotesquerie if they are helmed by an auteur who inspires in their team a cultlike devotion to \"The Vision.\" Among other things, *The Callisto Protocol* may have fallen victim to this phenomenon. In this case, however, it seems more like every developer who worked on this game was sincerely dedicated to scaring the shit out of every person who played it. I'm tempted to suggest each individual team didn't understand how outrageously vile the full product would be, they just turned in their best work and Dead Space happened, but that *can't* be true - too many moving parts are working together in exactly the right way to produce exactly the right experience for that to be the case. \n\n...Right?\n\nIt is this which makes me apprehensive about the attempt to remake the game. Don't get me wrong, I've got a good feeling about this one overall, and will probably purchase it day one assuming it doesn't have game-breaking technical issues (always wait for the reviews, no matter how much you trust the developers). From what we've seen so far, it looks awesome, and the team appears to be downright obsessed with doing justice to the original while correcting its flaws, which are very real and have been discussed ad nauseam.\\* I welcome updates and changes. It's just been nagging at me whether or not the original game caught lightning in a bottle. Anyone who has ever created anything knows that every change to a part causes consequences to the whole. Some concerns might just be the nostalgia talking - I, for one, prefer the original ***thunk*** of the plasma cutter, though I have yet to hear the new one in 3D Audio. But there are bigger things at stake. The most prominent example is of course Isaac having a voice, with all the new dialogue that entails. I know, I know, I'm sick of hearing about this too, but it's important to the broader point. This change could be good, it could even be great - I've always had a harder time projecting myself onto silent protagonists than empathizing with voiced characters who are very different from myself. Even so, the power of Isaac's silent expression of grief near the end of the original is enhanced by the fact that he's never done something like that before. He has stoically pursued his lost love through Hell and, at long last, it's revealed that every agonizing tribulation was for nothing, it was just a depraved trick. Despite all the visions which point to his inner turmoil,\\*\\* on some level you have forgotten Isaac, and now you remember that all of this trudging and shooting and repairing was not just an end unto itself, not just an excuse for gameplay to happen. Not to him. Nothing can beat BioShock, of course, but it's one of the most impactful uses of a silent protagonist I've ever seen. Of course, giving him a voice could have multitudinous positive effects which outweigh this, and who knows? Maybe knowing more about him will make the moment even deeper. There's a bigger risk with him speaking, however. In the original, you felt truly alone in large part because you knew that Isaac wasn't going to offer anything. He would never say anything to comfort himself, he wouldn't even express terror at his situation. This matters - to do so would establish a kinship between player and player character. The original manufactured an inherent separation which enhanced the horror. It was you and the game; Isaac and the Ishimura. Like I said - from what I've seen, the developers have been just as haunted by these questions as the rest of us. I don't think that Isaac will be spitting witty one-liners left and right. But even a healthy dose of wry humor could detract from that all-important desolation I've been prattling on about all this time. I only mean to suggest that the fact that they're haunted by these questions shows that there is something to fear here - the glory of Dead Space may be like that of a house of cards. There are surely other matters at issue which may warrant an even more extensive discussion, but I think I've conveyed my central point. It's probable that my chosen example is the least of our worries. A more technically-minded person could surely identify things which haven't even struck me as controversial at all. \n\nI have to remind myself, as anyone who has been nodding along with my screed thus far should, that the original still exists and will exist until time destroys the modern world, at which point we'll have bigger things to fret over. Nobody is taking anything away from anybody. The tiresome discourse surrounding casting and narrative changes in *The Last of Us* on HBO should have taught us all that lesson by now. And we haven't even played the game yet. Much like the lives lost on the USG Ishimura, in the end, this post was all for nothing. In a different sense, though - much like the lives lost on the USG Ishimura - the thought that it might not be, that its purpose might be ultimately fulfilled, is a horror so great as to be unspeakable.\n\n\\* In case you want to be nauseated: Sure, the turret section reinforces the theme of being under constant assault from every direction, but it exists at the cost of *feeling* like you are - the game, bless its heart, tries so hard make it verisimilitudinous, as much a part of the world as the item shop, but we all know it's a stupid turret section to break up the gameplay. The boss fights where you have to shoot glowing spots suck too, blah blah blah. I'm sure the remake will successfully address these issues, if for no other reason that there's almost nowhere to go but up.\n\n\\*\\* ...and, of course, his journal entries - though I didn't properly register the existence of these until I'd played through the game a few times...",

The issue is, the Euro has been significantly more valuable than the dollar every day except for about a month in the last five years and it is picking back up.\n\nWhat I find surreal is that as soon as the euro lost a bit of value, Sony, for example, was quick to increase its pricing when in reality we had been paying extra for it already. \n\nSo is there some mild conspiracy to squeeze the European market or does anyone understand the reason for this?",

This is gonna be LONG so sit tight and enjoy the ride.\nI'll begin by saying that my dream game would be the first anime/videogame hybrid in the world. What do I mean by that? I mean my game would be 50% a game you can play and 50% an anime you can watch.\nNow let me tell you what my idea is all about from the very beginning, This is how my game begins:\nMy game will be an RPG, dark souls style, with anime artstyle, you would have to create your own character first. You have to choose your job class among 3. A warrior (fights with a sword and shield) a magic caster (fights with magic) and a ranger (fights with a bow). After that's done you begin the game.\nYou begin the game in a dark cave, you get up, start walking around and don't see anything until you find fairies, human type of little fairies called \"Feesas\" and they all say \"WELCOME BACK LEGENDARY HEROES!!!\" and your character is all like what? \"Where are the legendary heroes?\" Say the fairies \"who are you?\" The fairies then tell you that they were waiting for the return of the legendary heroes who saved Nochnieland in the past (that's how the world you play in is called by the way).Then one fairy called \"Feetee\" appears and says she will be your companion, \"even if this one isn't as great as the legendary heroes\" say the fairies and feetee says \"yes\". And feetee is really smart, she is the one who will give you the tutorial part of the game, and then you get out of the cave and see the world of Nochnieland and feetee tells you that this world is in danger and that they need your help and you go to the first kingdom, to the weapon shop to get yourself a weapon and the female clerk says\" hello Feetee how's it going? Have the legendary heroes finally returned?\" \"Well something like that\" says feetee and then introduces you, huh?! Who are you?! Where are the legendary heroes?! She then tells you more about the legendary heroes. One hero was as tall and strong as a mountain and he always used a scythe, and the other hero was as small as a grain of rice and super smart, being to use ANY kind of magic spell. She then says she even prepared a powerful scythe for one of the legendary heroes to use. Anyway at the end she will give you your weapon which it will depend on the job class that you chose. And well guys, long story short, you explore the world of Nochnieland  and try to save it, throughout your journey you will be bullied A LOT!! Everybody is going to give you shit because you're not the legendary heroes who were supposed to appear to save the world! There will be even statues of the legendary heroes all throughout Nochnieland,and  people were even praying to it. But feetee always tells you: \"dont worry. Just be yourself\".\n\nThe world of Nochnieland will be extremely limited to explore. You will explore only about 30% of it and there will be only 3 dungeons and 3 bosses including the final boss. \n\nAnd then at the end of your journey after the credits, you are walking down the hallway of your castle at night, and you hear someone talking, you hear it's feetee and then: \"Man that stupid hero is so lameee\" you hear feetee is talking bad about you to the other fairies, \"the legendary heroes were strong, fast, smart they were perfect in every way meanwhile that stupid ass hero is the worst, they are slow, weak and here I thought I'd be able to meet them in person. But no, that stupid hero had to appear.\" Hahahahahaha you hear the other fairies laughing. Gosh feetee you're so mean hahaha ha. But I'm telling the truth he/she is the worst. And your character hears all this and gets sad and mad. Your character then goes to a plaza which has a statue of the legendary heroes and curses them. Fuck you!! Your character says, \"If you're so great why didn't you appear? They all say you saved them in the past, then why oh why didn't you appear again? You character gets furious \" I was the one who saved them not you! You character starts throwing stones at the statue, \"You! You...\"\n\n\"You abandoned your people...\"\n\nYour character then walks away in silence. Meanwhile the camera shows the moon and the night sky and it says \"THE END\"...\n\nThen it says:\nYou've unlocked the ADVANCED difficulty.\nYou've unlocked the MIND VS BODY mode. Now the party will REALLY begin! \nAfter you receive these notifications you need to start an empty file however THIS time you need to choose MIND VS BODY mode and then the difficulty in Advanced. And then you see two characters waking up from a dream in a dark cave and these characters are... you guessed it! THE LEGENDARY HEROES!! you will be able to play as them! And THIS is the REAL game!! This is where the game REALLY BEGINS!!! The giant hero ( 2.74 meters) is called Kogetsu Kaminoriko and the short hero (90 cm) is called Hideyoku Hidegire. And they are like brothers. Kogetsu is extremely strong but very dumb and Hideyoku is extremely smart, he can use magic and Kogetsu cant. \"What...what happened? Where are we?\" Says Hideyoku \"Kogetsu wake up!\n\nAnd well guys, like I said THIS is the TRUE game. \nYou will be able to explore 100% of Nochnieland including all the bosses and all the dungeons. (17 bossess and 12 dungeons) but that's not all THIS is where the anime part of the game begins. When playing as the legendary heroes you will find golden rolls of film all throughout Nochnieland and each of them unlockes a new episode for you to watch. And what is the anime about? Its about the PAST OF THE LEGENDARY HEROES before they were summoned to Nochnieland.Theres a total of 100 rolls of film. The anime will be mostly slice of life/ high school centered. They will show the school life kogetsu and Hideyoku had and their dark past. Kogetsu was abandoned by his mother. And Hideyoku was abused and tortured by his parents. And in this mode the anime and videogame will go hand to hand. What do I mean about that? For example: in the anime there's this character Tirano Kenkaryo who is Kogetsu's bully. In the videogame part he will be the King of Dragons whom you have to defeat. Nochnieland is a parallel world, which means there will be parallel versions all over the place. In the anime, Kogetsu and Hideyoku have a teacher and she will be a Queen of a Kingdom in the videogame version. And Kogetsu and Hideyoku will notice this and say \"yo sensei what are you doing here?\" And she'll say why do you call me sensei? I don't know you!\" That's when they discover they're not the same people they knew from school but their Nochnieland counterparts.\n\nThere's also the final mode of the game called \"CODE 148 VS CODE 666\" But I think I've talked enough already. Thank you so much for reading my silly comment about my dream game. What do you think? :D",

I love old school survival horror games. Signalis looks great and the atmosphere is brilliant. I think the game does many things right and a few things wrong. The things I don't like really put me off finishing the game.\n\nThe lack of inventory space drives me nuts. I have to keep back tracking all the time. It wasn't so bad at the start but the more I play its doing my head in. I don't mind badk tracking but when it's for nearly every pick up it becomes a real pain. I also hate how enemies revive if you don't burn them. The music that play every time an enemy spots you really starts to wear me down as well.\n\nYou also get to parts which you have no map. That's ok but the constant back tracking to find a save room makes having no map make irritating. I really think adding a backpack you could find giving more inventory slots would really help in this game. I know all survival horror games have back tracking, that's fine, I enjoy that but with Signalis I just find it a chore.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are fine. I enjoy them. What I didn't enjoy was the way the game flowed with some of the locked doors. I can't remember exactly but it was some thing like find the library key, use key on library, in library room find the eagle key, use eagle to find postbox key then use said key to find next key etc.\n\nIt was just key after key. No real puzzles in between or even mixing it up with a jewel in a statue or something lol.\n\nMaybe I'm just being fussy. I really thought I'd love this game but I can't be bothered to finish it. It has overwhelming reviews on steam so many people do love it. I can appreciate the effort it makes and its not a bad game at all.",

I spent about 14 hours min maxing, and it quickly became obvious that the defect’s main strat is to get as many 0 cost cards as possible while also getting cards that spawn other 0 cost cards into your deck. The relics don’t really change the core game, even when you get a dozen of them, Ascension mode doesn’t seem to change the game much. I’m tired of fighting the same waves of enemies that have the exact same approach to every combat regardless of which of the characters I’m playing. The characters are more similar than different, none of the bosses are compelling, and you run out of content to unlock super fast. There’s something enjoyable here, but the package is so lackluster. The music is boring and one note, the characters don’t even have animation, it’s really painful to replay. Putting this game up vs Inscryption it’s hard to not justify running through Inscryption again over Slay the Spire just because of the sheer amount of options. \n\nAm I missing something here? Anyone else just not really seeing the hype behind this game?",

Apparently the name walking simulator went through some flack a while back? But is now considered a positive label? \n\n2. Walking Simulator style narrative games where you literally walk or explore and have limited interaction or choice within the story, why not just watch a full length playthrough on YouTube? Do I need to just play one to get it? Or maybe it's just not for me?\n\n3. Potential ethical dilemma: I just watched a playthrough of What Remains of Edith Finch, and it was lovely, but now that I've seen it, why would I go buy it beyond showing my appreciation to the creators? Is that kind of the point, supporting the artist? Kind of like music on the radio, you listen for freez but then buy it because you enjoyed it so much? But if I just rewatch it again on YouTube am I \"stealing\" from the creator?\n\n\nLet me know your thoughts",

Anyways i digress on the scifi aspect\n\nBack to low fantasy, i think low fantasy allows you to build upon what you are already good at lets say Rockstar games wanted to take the premise of Red Dead Redemption a fully realized sim of realistic stories and create a new IP based on a similar setting but having supernatural elements cults, devil worshippers, witch burnings,  etc. \n\nOr if Naughty Dog creator of TheLastOfUs were to create a new IP based on Carnival Row tv show. Continue making adult content with heavy themes like political strife, classicism, racisim, interspecies and interracial relationships, immigration overpopulation, slave trade\n\nI think its very hard to stand out in video games anymore with new IP, you gotta make you stories and characters memorable. I thnk low fantasy manages to do this really well setting clear expections and limitations by making it grounded human stories where magical events happen.",

        "text": "Setting aside the issue of the non-existence of AAA games that involve a canonically gay male main character with a male love interest, it's weird how rare it to have a AAA game with a _straight female_ main character with a male love interest. Cheap romance arcs have become a lot less common these days, but I struggle to think of that many games that give a female main character a love interest at all. \n\nNier: Automata had 2B and 9S, but 2B is cold and distant to 9S up until the end of the A route &gt;!(because she's been ordered to kill him and erase his memories over and over again despite her feelings for him)!&lt;, when she finally shows her true feelings. That also ends up being the end of the majority of your time in control of 2B, as the B route puts you in control of 9S, and then &gt;!2B dies about an hour into the C/D routes!&lt;. Bayonetta 3 ended with &gt;!Bayonetta and Luca getting together!&lt;. After those two more recent examples, the last game I can think of is FFX-2, where you play as Yuna on a quest to find her lost boyfriend from FFX. It's strange that these examples all come from Japanese developers.\n\nOn the Western side, the developers of Remember Me talked about how hard they had to fight to show their main character [in a relationship with a man](https://www.eurogamer.net/why-publishers-refuse-games-such-as-remember-me-because-of-their-female-protagonists). Almost a decade after that, The Last of Us 2 had Ellie as the protagonist with a female love interest. While Aloy didn't start up a new relationship with anyone in Horizon: Forbidden West, the game did reveal that &gt;!Elizabet Sobeck, the woman Aloy was cloned from, was in a F/F relationship with Tilda van de Meer before the apocalypse!&lt;, meaning &gt;!Aloy is likely to be bisexual or a lesbian if the writers decide to pursue that in the future!&lt;. \n\nWhat's up with that? Has the West become more comfortable with two women kissing than a woman and a man? Are Western gamers more put off by putting themselves in the shoes of a female character than Eastern ones? Should gay men have _any_ hope to eventually see a gay man with a boyfriend/husband as the protagonist in a non-Bioware game?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10atxmr/cost_inflating_arms_race_in_graphical_fidelity/",
        "text": "We've seen many threads about how production times for \"AAA\" games lenghtened and production cost skyrocketed.\n\nYet we can all clearly see \"AAA\" games are not driving innovation in the space of storytelling, gameplay mechanics, or the use of the gaming medium. In fact, almost all improvements in \"AAA\" gaming for well over a decade seems to be centered about graphical fidelity (and financial models, but let's not open that pandoras box here). It's worth mentioning there are outliers, of course. Some games are not affraid to break away from the safe \"AAA mold\" despite big budgets, or just do one thing so much better than competitors it's enough to set them apart.\n\nOf course ,someone can claim graphical fidelity drives sales - after all it's immediately apparent and easy to show off in marketing. Therefore it's only logical for \"AAA\" games to spend as much time, money, and effort to make the game look good. Even if it means some compromises in other areas, drives up production costs, and lenghtens production cycles.\n\nBut let's look at it one step deeper. The vast majority of gamers are casual. I don't mean it in any derrogatory way, they are people who play games to relax after work, or spend some time with their friends in a fun way, but generally don't have the time or interest to follow the industry closely, search for obscure games, discuss trends and newest practises (or misspractises) in the industy, or visit this forum.\n\nAnd when an average casual gamer want to purchase a new game, what do they see? Well, most likely ads for all the newest, shiniest \"AAA\" games. That's the whole point of spending millions, if not billions on marketing each year by \"AAA\" publishers - make it the first thing a customer sees. Most casual gamers won't spend the time to research all different games and watch real reviews (I mean solid, in depth 30+ minutes reviews, not some IGN 3 min long totally-not-sponsored bullcrap). \n\nSo how do they decide what to buy? Well, as I've said, and you'll surely agree, the \"AAA\" industry is very homoginized. None of these games is willing to be crazy innovative. None of these games are weird or have unique qualities, maybe a gimmick or two that sounds good on a slogan, but never anything revolutionary. All trailers are very nice and cinematic, but follow the same trusty formula. Hopefully you see my point now. They will pick a type of game they want to play and whichever looks the nicest... because they don't have anything else to choose from.\n\nSo I pose that \"AAA\" studios do not just answer the demand. They cultivated a market with the type of content they put out. People don't \"want\" pretty looking shallow games. People buy those games, because that's all they see.\n\nWe're slowly approaching photorealism, and as progress in graphical fidelity slows down, the simple strategy no longer works. In an effort to squeeze additional polygons and ray traced reflections, \"AAA\" publishers are inflating their costs and development times in a desperate attempt to continue attracting eyeballs and outshine competitors - to answer the market which they created.\n\nI'm not trying to be some kind of anti-graphics preacher. Game looking nice is always jolly good. But if that's the only thing you focus on for over a decade, soon you'll hit a wall and pay the price. And oh boy, they are paying it.\n\nPlease, let me know if you think I'm on to something or just delusional :)",

Didn't care; it was entertaining to run around the map fighting monsters despite the pretty awful but amusing voice acting and language.\n\nCinematic trailer for [Warpath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YYmaNFClaA). Without knowing what game it was for, I thought it was a fairly decent and technically impressive piece of work. It somehow reminds me of the movie trailer for Warthunder from more than five years ago. They put a lot of effort into creating a cool-looking video, but it doesn't actually express much of the gameplay of the game they're promoting.\n\nE3 2011 gameplay trailer/demo for [Bioshock Infinite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WUt5dEMt_Y). After seeing the video and playing the game, I found that while the story had been significantly changed, the majority of the trailer's scenes had been preserved. Still a great game to play to this day.\n\n[God of War 2018 E3 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ_GCPaKywg). It was a major risk for them to revamp the series and try to give it a new direction. Personally, I thought it was all great! It was able to beat an amazing game for many awards, including GOTY. One of its greatest accomplishments was drawing a large number of new players from all over the world and of all ages to the franchise.\n\nLastly, [Final Fantasy VII Remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz9QWTcbXYE). When it was first unveiled at E3 and again when the opening cinematic was shown, I was blown away and also had a feeling of nostalgia. The original game was a part of my childhood, and the remake was a gaming experience like no other I've ever had in terms of desire fulfillment.\n\nHow about yours?

        "text": "Far Cry 5, released in 2018, is set in the rural United States and has you pitted against a religious, militant group. \n\nThat game had so much potential to have a powerful and impactful story. A religious, militant group in the rural US...it practically writes itself. \n\nThe marketing and everything about the game prior to release made it seem like they were leaning hard into it. This of course built hype, especially during a time for political and cultural divisions. The setting is perfect for a Far Cry game, where you do hit and run guerrilla style tactics. It could have been the next \"Spec Ops: The Line\", where people would be talking about it for a long while due to its setting and themes.\n\nAll the pieces were there...But then Ubisoft decided to \"not be political\" and \"not have a political statement\" to the game, and craps the bed instead with half-assed, wasted potential and generic Ubisoft blandness.\n\nOf course it's a political statement, what do you expect? Especially in such a setting and antagonists...Why not go all on the \"politics\"? Show the group followers and leaders nuanced and grey? You can even both sides while making a statement. Maybe the cult leaders have (somewhat) valid grievances? Show the cultural and political divisions, juxtaposed with the \"land of the free and home of the brave\", the superpower that is the USA. What does freedom mean? This is in the height of the Trump Presidency, the growing economic inequality of the US and political divisions/radicalism. The demise of blue-collar jobs and industry in the US with the rise of automation and outsourcing (to a lesser extent).\n\nPeople would eat it up, and it'd age far better than what we got instead. Spec Ops for instance, is still being talked about over a decade later, both the good and bad, because it didn't hold back in their messaging. It went all in, and it made a splash as a result. Wolfenstein: The New Order, is another one where it went (almost) all in on their setting and themes. There's literally a level set in a concentration camp. Although ironically, Wolfenstein 2 is scaled back with its messaging and themes to the point where the Nazis are kind of comical at times.\n\nI get that games, especially AAA games, are made to have a return on their investment and have high risk by extension. It feels like Ubisoft took the setting since it was the more topical, and made it a generic open-world game to the point where a Ubisoft game is literally a trope. \n\nIt oozes with potential to the point where it's legitimately annoying Ubisoft squandered it when they had the chance.",

To understand if and how video games are afforded different levels of prestige.\n2. To understand how who we are shapes the games we play and what we look for in games.\n3.

Maybe this RNG map generation provides you with specific starting resources that allow you to beeline down a different tech path.  Perhaps you find some unique relic/structure that gives you the ability to do something early on and therefore changes how you tech up.  \n\nBut I'll be damned if tech trees that exist purely as a stop-gap to prevent players from building things too early should exist.\n\nA good example (for me at least) of a tech tree that is flexible, but still has small requirements is the tech/research tree from Civ6.",

        "author": "crosslegbow",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/109wnc3/what_makes_a_game_world_immersive/",
        "text": "**Disclaimer: The intent of this post is not to make general commentary on any of these games, I'm mostly talking about my personal experience with these games and also touching on the general gaming zeitgeist.**\n\nAs the title says, I've been thinking about this for quite sometime now and it's an interesting discussion to me because I've seen a lot of attempts at nailing down the exact reasons for a game world feeling immersive and I still have a lot of thoughts with this.\n\nFirst, lemme define \"immersion in a game world\" for me. I think a game world is immersive when I'm engaged with that world by directly interacting with it. RDR2 is generally hailed as a prime example and rightly so because of it's *almost simulation* kind of approach to it's world design. and people do compare other game's aspects to RDR2 when the topic of immersion comes up. I'd clarify though, I don't consider general engagement with a game as immersion. For example, I find the Borderlands series very engaging but I'd never describe those games as immersive because my engagement comes from the game and not it's world necessarily.\n\nWith that said, I really like to discuss some examples that I personally consider immersive but I don't think it's because of the simulation nature because I don't consider any of these games as simulations in any way, I do have some reasons though why these feel immersive to me and that where the crux of this question is.\n\nExamples are, BOTW, Any souls game apart from Sekiro, Fallout New Vegas, Metro Exodus.\n\nTo me, all the above games felt very immersive too and neither of them are very detailed nor simulationy like lifelike NPCs in RDR2. The more I think about this, the more I realize that immersion to me has more to do with \"How much can I remember a game world?\" than anything else. Sure highly detailed world do help a ton in immersion but the fundamental quality I'm personally looking for in a game is \"how directly I interacted with a world and how much it I remembered it\". This is the crux of my point here. To follow on this,\n\n**BOTW** \\-&gt; Major way to engage with game is to engage with the world and interactivity b/w different systems in the game world do help a lot here. \n\n**Souls** \\-&gt; This is weird because on a surface level, I'd never think these games would be immersive. But they are for me, I'm surprised how much I remember the worlds in these games downright to the details. Maybe it's just good level design or maybe it's the fact that just like BOTW, we engage the game through it's world. Everything in these games is somehow tied to their worlds. I only exclude Sekiro because I personally see it as a more combat centric game more akin to Team Ninja's work rather than classic soulsbourne.\n\nAnd also both New Vegas and Metro Exodus(especially on ranger) lean heavily on their worlds and encourage a direct interaction with the world one way or the another.\n\nJust to give some counter examples here for my thesis, the game I think should feel more immersive but they don't to me are. Both Horizons and Cyberpunk. The reason I don't feel as immersed in these worlds is because I think I mostly interacted with these games using quests. This is especially true for Cyberpunk and don't get me wrong, I really love that game and have spent a lotta time in Night City but I strongly believe Cyberpunk takes a big hit on it's immersion because the way it is set up. Most of the quests in CP are obtained through your phone which makes sense for the setting but you don't really have to go to a place to get the gig/job/whatever. This is kinda disconnected from the game world itself and as a result I don't remember a lot of places distinctly from that game world. Also again, Night City as setting works against it in this aspect IMO.  \n\n\nReally interested to think what you guys think.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/109l9xb/a_defense_of_ludonarrative_dissonance/",
        "text": "The title of this post might seem like deliberate bait but it comes from a simple and maybe flawed observation of the usage of the \"concept\" of ludo-narrative dissonance in gaming related discussions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe term was first used long ago in a [blog post about Bioshock](https://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludonarrative-d.html) and it quickly spread as players and game developers alike finally found a word that describes something that has been \"plaguing\" the gaming industry since its inception. \n\nFor the (probably very few) people who don't know, ludo-narrative (or ludonarrative) dissonance describes the inconsistency between a game's plot or themes and its gameplay and mechanics. Common and famous examples of the issue are Rockstar games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption; games in which you can literally go on a rampage on the same level as the worst terrorist attacks in history and still end up with just a slap on the wrists by the authorities despite most of these games having avoiding the police as one of the driving factors of their plots. Not to mention the whole \"being forced to commit crimes even if the main theme of the game is redemption\" affair in Red Dead Redemption specifically. \n\n  \nSuffice to say that you yourself can probably think of countless examples of this, with varying degrees of \"intensity\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLudo-narrative dissonance is often, if not always, spoken about as if it is something to always avoid in the pursuit of the best possible \"artistry\". A game designer's measure of skill often seems to rely heavily on if they can create mechanical systems that reinforce or otherwise play off of the narrative and themes or vice versa. This is not without good reasons, it is definitely difficult to create such systems. Designing a game from the get-go in a way that effectively supports the gameplay with the themes and the plot is an arduous task that requires a great deal of creativity. It is certainly something worth praising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal issue begins when ludo-narrative dissonance gets used to substantially or entirely dismiss the value and quality of a game without further explanation. Basically the argument becomes that if a game \"suffers\" from heavy ludo-narrative dissonance then that is a sign that the game's design is poor or lesser in some way. From my point of view though ludo-narrative dissonance is not a inherently \"bad\" thing. Undoubtedly it is not a inherently \"good\" thing either but there are reasons why it may be specifically desired by the developers.\n\nFirst we must recognize that players and developers basically make a \"deal\" every time they engage with games: the \"deal\" is that the player is going to receive the \"best possible version\" of what the developer intended the game to be and what they were capable of making as a whole. \n\nThe issue with this deal is, as with any other form of art, that the \"best possible\" version of what the artist intended and what they were capable of depends heavily on the receiver, in this case the player.\n\nWhile the deal is obviously made by multiple parties only the individual player decides if the product they received meets the requirements. This creates issues because, while many aspects of a game can be objectively critiqued and deemed \"inadequate\", many if not most other aspects are almost entirely subjective. To be more clear you can argue that some aspects of the game are simply not good but there will always be some varying amount of design choices whose impact on the quality is inherently subjective. I argue that ludo-narrative dissonance is part of the latter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most simple reason why that is is that some players do not need or even want their games to be ludo-narratively consistent. A lot of people are perfectly happy to totally suspend their disbelief in order to have the experience that best suits their needs. \n\nFollowing the previous example: you can surely make GTA a game in which you get punished realistically for the crimes you commit but that would transform the game in such a way that it would \"break the terms of the deal\" for most of its players. Most people go on rampages playing GTA and they don't want to be punished for it while still desiring the narrative to create tension by making the possibility of being arrested by the police a real threat. \n\nSome might argue that this is a design philosophy that simply tries to appeal to the \"lowest common denominator\" of players and only exists because of a desire to make as much money as possible. While this may be true I don't personally feel like this should make games with heavy ludo-narrative dissonance inherently worse anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, if you hate ludo-narrative dissonance, please feel free to criticize it. I'm not writing this to stop you and convince you that actually it is a good thing; my desire is for people who use it as a sort of \"trump card\" to easily dismiss games they don't like to simply reconsider doing it. There are millions of good reasons to dismiss games that are worth mentioning but their ludo-narrative dissonance should not be among the first ones; it is something best left to each player to figure out if they find it acceptable as part of their \"deal\" or not.",

In The Witcher 3, which i'm playing right now, it seems like the \"follow the tracks\" mechanic was their only idea on how to guide the player.\n\nI will try to explain what are the problems with it:\n\n* **You are not actually investigating**: you are not put in front of an actual mystery to solve, you are just looking for red objects to interact with. There is no good or bad way to investigate the area, you just have to find all the interactions.\n* **You don't look for anything else in the world**: i think these quests are supposed to make you live and inspect the world. The effect, however, is quite the opposite: both when looking for the interactions and when following the tracks, your mind will be only focused on the red objects to look for, making you miss all the scenery carefully crafted to enrich the story telling of the quest.\n* **You don't care about the mystery:** most of the times, you are not invested in the problem you are trying to solve: you have just picked up a side quest, and you are immediately put or led to the area you have to investigate. You have had no time to actually think of the problem by yourself, so when the character starts to deduce things from the area, you cannot even follow his reasoning, because you don't know what the problem is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a gamer, i think that pointing out the problems with some design choices is already enough, as i'm not supposed to also think of the solutions needed. Still, i'd like to make some suggestions on how to improve this design:\n\n* **Make it challenging**:  for example, there should be multiple objects to interact with, and only some of them should give useful tips on how to progress the quest. In this way, the player is forced to take his time and think about what he's investigating.\n* **Make it failable**: there should be a good and a bad way to investigate the area, the good way should give the player the easy to follow tracks path, the bad way should make harder (if the investigation is not repeatable) or even impossible (if it is repeatable) to find the right path. This can be done in multiple ways, like setting a limit of objects you can investigate, or giving the player wrong directions when inspecting the wrong object.\n* **Use the accessibility options**: frustrated players will either stop playing or look for the solution online. Just make their life simpler and provide an accessibility options that highlights the correct interactions and the path to follow.",

I'd rather a Laura Croft style \"just press buttons and get through the cinematic\" sequence than having the sequence going on AROUND ME...but Im just fighting the most boring shit in the game trying to kill them asap so I can watch the cool shit going on in the distance. \n\nThe game LOOKED phenomenal...I wanted to eat the scenery...I just didn't want to PLAY the \"It's A Small World but norse gods\" game. I just wish developers would pick one...either make a GREAT game...or tell a GREAT story. Ragnarok feels like the epitome of your game getting in the way of your story which is getting in the way of your game. \n\nFor Rangarok I felt like the ending was MOSTLY filler...you had 2 bosses...and the rest was filler between big story beat cutscenes. Run through this boring maze of trenches and boring level design but shit is exploding now so you can fight a bunch of basic enemies you've fought a thousand times in a rushed manner where you just want to move the fuck on. \n\nThe game has some INCREDIBLE sequences, don't get me wrong...they just happen to all be early on, in the midpoint, and before the climax. Spread out between filler sections of \"generic enemy spawns out of ground and attacks\" kill hallways and conversations that seem to only want to happen because they put a cliff I have to climb slowly. \n\nId MUCH rather the game be an adventure game with some combat mixed in and mostly about story...that seems to be where its strongsuit is. Setpiece locations, they WANT to do puzzles (they suck), and 90% of the level design is there to facilitate characters talking....but no...gotta spam enemies. \n\nAnd overall the game has so many problems that make it feel super dated:\n\n\\- The puzzles fuckin suck, they aren't compelling. It's square ability for the square hole. I roll my fuckin EYES every time they stick some nice loot behind a low effort puzzle where you throw your thing at the thing and press the button maybe before. \n\n\\- Oh, the loot system fuckin sucks...generic mats. Yay. SOMETIMES you get some cool shit but most of the time it's just filler mats and randomly some cool armor is now craftable after a story sequence. Stick the cool shit IN the chest the enemies can drop the boring mats. Why is crafting IN THIS FUCKIN GAME? Just have the armor be the armor...level scaling...done. Wanna use the X weapon? Sorry you dont have the mats your other weapon is hitting WAY stronger right now. \n\n\\- They ruined looting too...\"great I gotta go poking around this fuckin hallway looking for some generic chest\" gets fuckin old when you are in the MIDDLE OF CHARACTER SCENES...but stop...they stuck a chest over here let me go digging around and doing a puzzle but we \"are in a hurry\". \n\n\\- What happened to FEELING LIKE A GOD...because you never do. You'll get canceled by weak attacks, you'll get killed by filler draugr, there are so many ways to do this franchise and have your cake and eat it too and they stick to doing shit the most plain way possible. They REALLY should either change the entire franchise to something else and keep doing what they are doing...or change the combat and level design to facilitate feeling like a GOD. The story treats me like an unkillable god...the game world treats me like I'm gunna die from a plant spitting on me. \n\nTLDR\n\nEnd of the day, the visual design team is FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS...the level design team is flopping hard and the gameplay team makes playing a god feel like you're about to die at any moment from anything because they don't want to design the game around making you feel powerful EXCEPT the other powerful shit. \n\nStory is its own critique but imo talking about story in a gaming sub is a waste of time. I really only care to talk about how the story is BUILT INTO the game...not the details. And frankly I don't really find the God of War storytelling (mostly the macro) to be very much competent outside of key character relationships and dialogue (micro is better).",

        "text": "Turned 30 last November. I was an avid gamer throughout my whole life. Started with Age of Empires, played hundreds of hours of Warcraft III, WoW, was Global Elite in CS, also played a lot of PUBG, Apex, COD, BF, Trackmania, Dota and what not. Alone and with friends. Also tried some solo games like Civilization, Anno, RCT, Cities: Skylines etc., but I always was kinda competitive, so returned to online games quickly.\n\nI am sitting in front of my computer and for the first time in 25 years I am starting to realize that this might be the time to stop gaming for good. Obviously this was a steady decline, as i already had less interest in gaming throughout 2022. Still, this is hard to admit, as I was borderline addicted to gaming and always cherished my 2-3 evenings a week when i played (obviously this was much more when i was in school and uni). \n\nI can't point the finger on the exact reasons why i feel this way. New online games are becoming more and more frustrating, as I do not have that much time anymore to invest to \"get gud\" (and i hate being bad). Not to name the toxicity in some games like Dota. Offline games do not appeal to me, as knowing that there is a \"scripted end\" to a game, and no real competititon, turns me off. I dont know if I need to rethink my relationship to and my purpose of gaming, but as of right now, gaming doesn't give me any feeling of joy, pride or accomplishment anymore. Something that i never experienced in the past.\n\nThere might be some people here that probably feel the same or went through this in the past. What are your thoughts about this? Did it got better and what did you do? Am i just burned out and need some time off? What are good alternative hobbies?",

        "text": "It's something that I just noticed but video game trilogies seemed to be very popular in the 7th generation. I mean here's a short list:\n\n* Uncharted 1, 2 and 3\n* Gears of War 1, 2 and 3\n* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1, 2 and 3\n* Call of Duty World at War + Black Ops 1 and 2 (same continuity)\n* Resistance 1, 2 and 3\n* Killzone 1, 2 and 3 (6th to 7th, so not really but close enough)\n* God of War 1, 2 and 3 (again 6th to 7th, but tail end of PS2)\n* Lost Planet 1, 2 and 3\n* Assassin's Creed Ezio trilogy\n* BioShock 1, 2 and Infinite\n* Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3\n* Halo 3, ODST and Reach (OK not really, but still 3 games in the same series. Plus 1 and 2 can be included if we include 6th gen)\n\nHowever, now that we've transitioned into 8th and 9th gen, these trilogies are nowhere to be found. Now we have standalone games that get a sequel years later, not even close to the rapid pace we got them one and a half decades ago. Why is this? Is it simply because development time has become so much longer?",

I thought the L4D2 versus mode is a bit more competitive in the sense that there were less chances of camping along the map (because of chargers). But that is just through my experiences so far.\n\nPlease let me know what y'all think. Thank you!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1086flg/are_we_beyond_graphical_fidelity_if_not_when/",
        "text": "First of all, I think it's safe to say many people still favor good graphics and they are still a big wow factor before release. I remember the unwarranted hype Cyberpunk got, even if we really had no idea how finished the game would actually be. I saw a lot of criticism over the GTA 6 leaks because the graphics weren't that good (obviously because it was a test version of the game), as if they would be the thing that makes the game. Especially young people seem to always jump the hype train the moment they see promotional materials that make the game look beautiful. \n\nThat being said, for quite some time I've gotten the feeling that the graphical fidelity is maybe becoming less of a factor in the future. Especially many indie games, and other more popular games like Fortnite and Minecraft, have intentionally steered away from graphical fidelity in favor of a certain aesthetic and art style. I've seen more and more games attempting to replicate the nostalgic PS1 era graphics. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the law of diminishing returns, where the improvements of tech are getting harder to notice. The jump from PS1 to PS2 was an immense leap. So was the jump from PS2 to PS3. But the jump from PS3 to PS4 was a lot less significant, and games like Battlefield 3 or GTA V still hold up. There's only so much we can still achieve in the future, and the developers must put more emphasis on making the games look unique, rather than follow the old template of maximum graphical fidelity. \n\nPersonally (possibly because of my interest in older games and nostalgia), graphics barely even matter to me anymore. They are even a downside, if I should upgrade my PC or buy a new console, and download 100gb worth of data to get those sweet 4k textures. Just not worth it. The color pallette, art style and aesthetics matter so much more to me, and I think games like GTA Vice City (PS2 version) with its unique 1980's VHS aesthetic look superior to some sterile and bland new games that just blindly pursue photorealism without any real art direction. \n\nI just can't help the feeling that so many man-hours and resources could be saved (both in development, and in the end user) if more developers just stopped pursuing high graphical fidelity and rather focus on the art style. I don't know much about the technical side of things, but one would imagine a map with the polygon count of GTA San Andreas could have immense amounts of interiors and other such qualities with modern hardware, as opposed to a highly detailed map in a modern game where the polygon count is huge and every interior would require so much more effort to create. I feel that many new games really lack in scope and depth, despite good graphics.",
