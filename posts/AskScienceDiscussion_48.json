        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post something like this, but not sure where else. This might get complicated but please bear with me....\n\nI had a professor in college that did a pretty good job explaining the difference between the third and fourth dimensions, from a human perception standpoint. He was good because he would play us clips from an MIT professor explaining it...(I went to a small state school lol). \n\nSo imagine you were a two dimensional being, like the king in a deck of cards. All of your perception is two dimensional all height and width, but no depth. If a balloon, a 3D object, was to pass through your plane of perception, it would start as a dot, grow to a circle, then shrink back to a dot as it passes through. You have no ability to see the whole balloon (the 3 dimensional form), only the cross section that exists on your plane, or dimension, of perception. \n\nBased on the understanding that the fourth dimension is time, we, as three dimensional beings, are only able to perceive reality, including ourselves, in a cross section of the fourth dimension, or the very moment we are in. \n\nIf there was a hypothetical being that had fourth dimensional perspective, it would see us as the total of everywhere we’ve been and everywhere we will go, from birth to death, but since we have a third dimensional perspective, we are only able to see a cross section of the fourth dimension, or the exact moment that’s occurring as our fourth dimensional selves pass through the third dimension. \n\nMakes sense, right?\n\nIf I haven’t lost you yet, maybe there’s some one out there that can explain the fifth dimension in this way. If we had fourth dimensional perspective, what would the fifth dimension cross section be?\n\nIt also seems to reason that a 2D being, like the king, could still perceive the fourth dimension, I.e. the time it takes for the balloon to pass through its plane. Are we, as 3D beings, able to perceive the fifth dimension in any way? \n\nAlso, I know the biological ability to perceive reality differs from species to species, most simple example is humans have ability to see portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (color) that some animals that see in black and white cannot. Is there any evidence to suggest that there are species that can perceive more of the fourth dimension than humans?\n\n",

        "text": "My wife and I are doing IVF due to my male infertility issues and reciprocal balanced translocation. We're in our mid to late 30s, and it's been taxing for both of us, especially my wife. For the first retrieval they extracted 15 eggs from her and for this recent one it was 12 eggs. Both times we we're left with zero viable blastocysts. With each retrieval she needs to go through a normal cycle before we can try all over again. Looking at the hunger games thread it seems that our case isn't rare:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6v3kyz/lpt\\_first\\_time\\_ivf\\_ladies\\_get\\_emotionally\\_ready/](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6v3kyz/lpt_first_time_ivf_ladies_get_emotionally_ready/)\n\nTo top it off, the PGS testing costs $4K each time. We can freeze them and send them off in a bulk, but we don't even have enough day 5 blastocysts to make it worth it yet.\n\nThis all seems somewhat wasteful for me. With how many cases of IVF stem from the male infertility, it seems like it would be ideal to clone these eggs and then continue to inject them with various sperm till one is successful.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIVF is a painful, time\\-consuming, costly process, and often times it's male infertility that's the issue. It would be great to be able to inject cloned eggs instead. Curious to know why we're not using cloned eggs instead? Is there something preventing the medical community from doing this?",
