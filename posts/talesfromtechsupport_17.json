        "text": "*Hi there. It's your friendly neighbourhood medicinal chemist here, back with another story filled with carcinogens and (literal) tears. I'm also happy to report that I'm no longer a lowly PhD student - I've ascended to the heady realms of postdoctoral researcher. You can call me Dr Fitzarr.*\n\n**$Me:** Your newly-minted postdoctoral researcher.\n\n**$PhD:** A PhD student from a neighbouring research group to mine.\n\n**$Res:** A researcher from Biology\n\n**$Est:** Our estates leader\n\n**$MSc:** A MSc student from the aforementioned group.\n\n**$Boss:** My boss, also Head of Section.\n\n**$BigBoss:** My boss's boss, our Head of School. Also the head of the neighbouring research group.\n\nHi everyone! It's nice to be back. I've submitted a couple of other stories from my experience as the tehcnically-kind-of-not-really tech support person for my organic chemistry department at a research organisation in the UK. For background, see them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7qszyo/a_tale_of_supermagnets_and_servers/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85imrw/should_it_be_spraying_methanol_everywhere/).\n\nI have a doozy of a story today. Technically, these events took place a couple of weeks ago - however, there has been a lot of drama and fallout that only really resolved itself in the last couple of days (and I didn't want this to be one of those multi-part epics). So, strap in, and come along with me for the ride. Unlike previous cases with my posts here, there isn't a lot of technical information to provide to help the non-chemist understand the background. Really, I just need to tell you what [lachrymators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear\\_gas) are. Essentially, a lachrymator is any chemical that causes people to produce tears.\n\nAs I stated in my intro, I'm no longer a PhD student! I've recently been promoted to postdoctoral researcher. As part of this (as well as being paid an actual wage), I'm now officially in charge of lab safety for our small section of the department. This includes both my research group and the neighbouring group. This group is technically supervised by $BigBoss. However, his role as Head of School leaves precious little time for actual supervision. I'm therefore the default go-to person for a lot of  the day-to-day issues, as well as being the person who can now officially tell other people they're being idiots. I was therefore the person called by $PhD when the entire neighbouring research group started crying uncontrollably.\n\nAfter ruling out an impromptu viewing of Forrest Gump or Marley and Me, I evacuated the area and informed our estates team that something was potentially up. I then donned a face mask (which barely helped) and looked for the source of whatever was causing the problem. A pool of liquid on the floor by the chemical inventory seemed the obvious culprit, especially as it was giving off an acrid smell only suitable for Beelzebub's arsehole. I backed a healthy retreat, and waited for $Est to arrive with the proper health and safety equipment. Armed with much better masks, we cleaned up the spill, and I took a small sample to run through our LCMS to see what it was. Thinking the worst was over, I signed on $Est's accident report and went back to my lab to write an angry email about cleaning up spills. Even before the LCMS had finished running, $PhD was back in my office saying the problem wasn't resolved. They were still crying buckets of tears and unable to work safely.\n\nI called $Est again, and investigated the lab and office of $BigBoss's group more thoroughly. This time, I turned up something much more interesting. At the bottom of the bins in the office and the lab there were wads of tissue soaked with the same thing (by smell, at least) as had been on the floor of the lab. At this point, it should be noted that we have large bins with fluorescent orange bags in them for hazardous chemical waste (this covers everything from gloves and tissues to chemical reagents etc). These bins were not the ones used for the soaked tissues. The use of the office bin was particularly crazy even from a logistical stand-point, as you would have to walk past two chemical bins to even get to the office door. We have strict rules about what is allowed in the lab and what is allowed in the office. Tissues soaked in mystery chemicals is definitely not on the latter list. I therefore was left with only two options: 1) incredible incompetence, 2) deliberate foul play.\n\nAt this point, I made an executive decision that no-one would be going into these offices for a while. Definitely until we found out whatever the hell the chemical was and had done a thorough deep-clean of the office space. $Est and his team started on a full search and clean mode, and I went to $Boss's office. I informed him of what I'd found, what I'd done, and that he would probably want to see $BigBoss as soon as possible. After discussing the details with him (and watching him get more and more incredulous), I went to check the results of the LCMS. They were decidedly inconclusive; whatever the compound was didn't ionise well, or was otherwise difficult to analyse this way. Method number two. Take the sample I'd scraped off the floor, run it through some filtration setup, then attempt to get an NMR spectrum. After a lot of faffing around, I managed to get a half-decent spectrum. This revealed the identity of our lachrymator: [benzyl bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl_bromide). I'll let the Safety section of the wikipedia article speak for itself.\n\n&gt;Benzyl bromide is a strong lachrymator and is also intensely irritating to skin and mucous membranes. Because of these properties, it has been used in chemical warfare, both in combat and in training due to its irritating yet non-lethal nature.\n\nBy the time I'd confirmed the identity of the compound, the investigation of what the hell had happened was in full swing. $Est had sealed off the office and lab space with hazard tape, and $Boss and $BigBoss were busy interrogating the members of $BigBoss's research team. The whole thing was a bit surreal. General suspicion in the department fell (fairly or not) upon $MSc - the most junior member of the team. $MSc was also rather typical of the course intake over the past few years; a foreign student without a strong chemistry background who had to be taught a lot of basic principles about lab safety. In any case, no-one was talking or accepting blame.\n\nOver the following week, $Est and our security team reviewed CCTV (we don't have it in the labs/offices, but on the entrances to the department) and office fob records. These didn't appear to reveal anything suspicious. A number of emails were sent to members of the department informing them of the incident and asking them to come forward with any information, and keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour. There was inevitably a lot of gossip flying around as well.\n\nCut to the events of Monday. Another member of the department was working particularly late (around 9pm), and happened to spot someone going into the office space of $BigBoss's group. They called security, and $Res (a researcher I didn't previously know from Biology) was caught going through the chemical inventory of $BigBoss without a good explanation as to why. $BigBoss was called in from home, and $Res apparently confessed to planting the previous spill to get back at $BigBoss for not endorsing a research grant that would have enabled him to stay at the university.\n\nAll in all, easily the most dramatic event of my time here. Even beating out the discovery of some WWII hand-grenades in the basement.",

(She wasn't agitated or anything, quite calm). Head up there and go see what's the issue.\n\nShe said they have tried printing, unplugging the printer from the computer and going away coming back, plugging it back in and turning the printer off and on again. Still not printing.\n\nThat's when I said try printing the document and lets check the settings.\n\nThat's when she saw she was trying to print page 3 of a 1 page document. She said I don't know why it tried to do that, but we deleted the page number, pressed print and about 4 copies of that printed out.\n\nI walked out of the room and walked down the stairs and couldn't help but to just laugh. This isn't one of the silliest times we have had to help, but it's up there lately lol.",

        "text": " Hello everyone,\n\nBeen suggested to post this here as you guys would enjoy this story\n\nJust one thing on beginning: My English is poor, so please excuse my grammar, formatting, etc...\n\nThis happened 3 years ago when I joined small IT company. I started as the IT Technician dedicated to offer support on site with servers, computers, emails, etc. However, in not that busy time I’ve been asked to do some “laptop” repairs in our workshop. At that time, I did not have much knowledge about hardware in cheap laptops like the one that this story would be about.\n\nEverything started at one day when I did not have nothing to do, so I’ve been asked to assist Workshop manager by helping with some of the jobs or with booking of the jobs to the workshop. Older couple walked in to our workshop with cheap laptop. Let’s call the brand of that laptop **H**arry**P**otter. They complained about slow speed and some of the keys on laptop have not been working. So, I took their details and explained, that we are limited with the things that we can do with keyboard to fix it and we might would need to replace the keyboard.\n\nWorkshop manager told me that this job should be simple for me and to have a look at it straight away, so I did. I booted up the Laptop and realized that there was barely 1 letter that was working. Usually replacing keyboard is much cheaper then trying to fix faulty one. I took out the keyboard, connected external one then proceeded to look on performance issues. Taking away unneeded start-up entries and services rapidly increased performance of the laptop. After this initial work I called the customer that the performance issue was resolved, and the keyboard would require to be replaced. I quoted them our minimal bench fee (around 30£) and price of the new keyboard (around 12£). Keyboard arrived, and I did connect the new keyboard. After that laptop refused to boot up. Fast forward this was caused by keyboard, but because my poor knowledge in laptops hardware I told customer that the motherboard failed (Yeah, funny I know). They said that this is strange and mentioned that they will get their son to call us as he is working for brand HarryPotter.\n\nNext day I received call from “John” and said that he is from head office of HarryPotter (And indeed he was, as I found later through some searching on internet). He proceeded with questions like: Have you been using Genuine keyboard, have you been doing work on anti-statics matts, etc… After these questions has been answered mostly with word Yes, he then proceeded that he thinks that I want to scam his parents and earn easy money. He also said that this is extremely unacceptable as his father suffering with cancer and I can’t imagine what he had to go through. I did say I did not quoted them more then our minimum bench fee and, I did not offer them any replacement of their laptop, so with all respect I don’t know why he does have that feeling. Also, I said I know how people with cancer suffer as my Grand Mother died because of cancer.\n\nAfter my Workshop Manger found where I did the mistake I called him and apologised for my mistake and said that we will fix that. He replied that he is not interested, and his parents will collect the laptop and he will fix it for them.\n\nThey collected laptop and I though this would be end of that. After two months they came back to our workshop with laptop which was completely stripped down and broken motherboard in half. They said his son couldn’t fix the laptop and he damaged motherboard. We told them that the motherboard can’t be fixed, and replacement would be beyond economical repair and we offered them new laptop. They agreed, and we transferred all their DATA to new machine.\n\nMy Workshop manager decided to call customer's son after they visit us for second time, just for the fun. Workshop manager was asking something like we need to find what happened with this laptop as your parents could not explained it to us. He was trying to blame us for breaking M/B in half and lot of different BS. He newer really admitted that he broke the motherboard.\n\nIn the end they been so impressed how we prepared new machine for them and with the performance of new machine, that they decide to sign maintenance contract with our workshop and mentioned that they would never ask their son to fix their laptop.",

Arriving at work for the day, he cheerfully greeted the front desk employee as he continued to the IT area. Picking up a cup of coffee, he headed over to his cubicle. $Sup2 gave a little wave hello while busy working on a project. $Selben checked his voicemail as he powered up his machine. He started working on the T1 ticket queue. It wasn’t glamorous work, listening and transcribing voicemails, and requesting more info from users, but it was necessary.\nAfter a couple hours, the first supervisor change of the day happened. $Sup2 headed out and $Sup1 took over. $Selben wasn’t a huge fan of $Sup1 as he was usually too busy bragging about his last “hot date” to be of any real help or use. Whenever a major issue arose he would often make himself scarce and unavailable, until it became the next supervisor’s problem.\n\nThings were going well until $Selben came across an email and matching voice mail. Both were vague and sounded like a user had lost a vehicle. Why would IT be involved in this? $Selben opted to contact the branch’s manager, $Gruntled, for more details.\n\nThe phone call was broken up and full of static, which made understanding $Gruntled, the disgruntled user, even more difficult.\n\n\n&gt; $Gruntled: Gruntled!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Hello. This is $Selben from the IT department. I’m calling about a voicemail and email you left. I need some more infor—.\n\n&gt; $Gruntled: Did you find it yet? Plate number 12345!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Uh, no, not yet. I wanted to clarify what you needed? Your message was a little vague.\n\n&gt; $Gruntled: My truck is missing! YOU PEOPLE NEED TO FIND IT!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Right. This is the IT department. I’m still not sure…?\n\n&gt; $Gruntled: OH NO, YOU DON’T! This is YOUR issue, not mine! We only have 2 weeks left, you better find it! Bye!\n\n \n$Selben sat trying to get the gears in his head to move again. He had been blindsided by the call and wasn’t sure how to proceed. It was times like this he missed $Soda. He took what notes he had and approached $Sup1’s office for guidance. Who had his feet on the desk and was playing with his phone. He looked annoyed when he noticed $Selben in his doorway. \n\n$Selben explained the issue, with the little information he had: The manager kept proclaiming that his truck was missing, and that it was IT’s responsibility to find it.\n \n&gt; $Sup1: And?\n&gt; $Selben: Could it be some GPS thing maybe that only we have access to on some vehicles?\n \n$Sup1 did not even look up from his phone.\n \n&gt; $Sup1: No. If it’s lost, report it to the police, and close the ticket.\n&gt; $Selben: I mean, could it be something…\n \n$Sup1 looked up for a moment, very annoyed.\n \n&gt; $Sup1: Just go do it!\n \n$Sup1 then returned to playing with his phone.\n\nUnder $Sup1’s orders, $Selben reported the company vehicle stolen to $Gruntled’s local police department, updated his notes, and closed the ticket.\n\nWithin a couple days, $Gruntled was pulled over by the police at gunpoint. Corporate headquarters was contacted, and it was quickly straightened out that the vehicle was, in fact, not stolen. At first $Selben was reprimanded for calling the police until he showed his notes indicating that $Sup1 had given him the directive to do so. $Sup1 denied the claims and eventually the whole thing was dropped, since if $Sup1 wasn’t at fault, then no one was at fault.\n\nAs it turned out $Gruntled had been trying to find his company vehicle in a spreadsheet for an annual audit. It was apparently ~~right in plain sight~~ hidden under the ‘Vehicles’ tab.",

Nice enough but exclusively asks for my help when I'm on my lunch break.\n\nOur individual timesheets are fairly simple spreadsheets that calculate hours worked by time in, lunch break, and time out, all updated by the employee, very straight forward. There is also a place to note sick days/annual leave as these are paid so wouldn't count against your hours worked. A work day is 7hr 24m FYI.\n\nOne employee took a half day sick and so credited herself 3:42 in the area alotted. No problems.\n\n$TL has apparently checked the ID card logs and finds that it wasn't a full half day and wants to put the actual time in/out for posterity. It won't change the amount the employee is paid or affect her sickness record at all but whatever tickles your giblets I suppose, it doesn't involve me...or does it?\n\n'Course it does.\n\n$TL comes over in my lunch break, I pointedly ignore, $TL isn't fazed, she asks for help.

I keep eating, and each bite is all the sweeter.\n\nOff my lunch break now and positively wetting myself with anticipation.\n\n$TL (email): can you have a look at [REDACTED] timesheet. She has entered 3.42 and I need to change it to 4.89 but every time I try it comes up with a random formula.\n\n$Me to $Me: surely she isn't trying to...?\n\nShe was.\n\nNow obviously for reasons of sanity and sense our timesheets are formatted as [h]:[mm].

        "text": "For once not posting about work but general Dad'ism and IT support for the old man over the years. My dad bless is kind of stuck in the 60s and 70s and his patience is random each day. I have been giving my parents IT support and help since the end of the 90s when they got into the whole internet thing as my dad calls it. My mum can use a smart phone or laptop and doesn't require much help. I basically build her a laptop put Office on with Chrome and away she goes!\n\n**Technical terms my dad has used over the years:**\n\nHard Drive\n\n\\- Describing the PC case/tower he kept this up until about 2 years ago\n\n\"Whats my email website\"\n\n\\- Not long after first using email he was still calling it this until about 2007\n\nI'm running out of RAM space on this USB stick\n\n\\- Teaching him about USB sticks took many sessions/phone calls\n\nI don't like this new mouse I prefer one with a ball\n\n\\- Optical mouse upgrade\n\nWe put a new cartridge in the printer about 6 months ago it's run out already?\n\n\\- Always complaining about the printer\n\nIf I put in Robin AND Pete's email address can I email them both at the same time?\n\n\\- Not long after first using email\n\nMany years ago he was part of a fishing club and I did some part time work setting them up a website. After it had been reviewed by the fishing club and went live my dad began to complain that he wasn't getting emails.\n\n**Me:** \"What email address did you give them, also it's on the website under Contact Us people can use that or just click and it'll open an email box\"\n\n**Dad:** \"The one you told me [www.fishingclub.co.uk](https://www.fishingclub.co.uk)\"\n\n**Me:** \"No that's the website address remember email is the one with the @ symbol so it will be [dad@fishingclub.co.uk](mailto:dad@fishingclub.co.uk)\"\n\n**Dad:** \"Let me write this down it's so much to remember I thought you could email either\"\n\nOver the years my dad has lost his temper and broken a lot of IT tech. A Lexmark printer ended up going out the bedroom window hitting the patio below. I built my parents a nice shiny dual core PC to upgrade their old dying AMD system when they moved house. My dad decided upon getting angry with Word and Excel really pressing the power button hard or thumping it would work. I visited one day and notice 2 screws in the front of the PC case.  My dad had used a bit of force on the power button and it had depressed into the case, so he had used a metal bracket and two screws to hold it back in place. Slightly impressed he had opened the case up without breaking the PC itself.\n\nI remember a story when I was about 13 when I was first getting in to IT and building computers. I had bought my first PC from a company called Tiny. It was an Intel Celeron 333mhz which I upgraded by putting in another 32mb of ram and put a Voodoo 3000 card into for Counter Strike. Anyway wanting to make a few quid my dad suggested selling off the old Intel PI MMX 166mhz machine I still had. I told him I'd have to put the cpu fan back on, find the case side and reinstall Windows as it was in bits. Anyway no idea why but he decided to have a go at doing this himself which resulted in sparks and smoke, still no idea to this day which pins he had put the cpu fan onto. Needless to say the motherboard was fried and being a 5 to 6 year old PC just wasn't worth repairing. Great job!\n\nMy dad is forever using the SPACE BAR in Word or Excel instead of tabbing so whenever he goes back to edit something or changes font or size text jumps everywhere... don't get me start on tables or pictures either ha!\n\nThe biggest best and worst IT problem he has is using laptops which he and my mother switched to over a desktop when they downsized and moved about 6 years ago. We've tried Dell, HP, Fujitsu and Lenovo various models and different ages. About 6 months ago I had to replace a mouse pad and left mouse button on a HP G3 as he had broken them through anger when using MS Word.\n\nLiterally a motherboard out job just to change buttons and a pad... annoying build and design. His problem is using the mouse pad on laptops he always finds a way for his hand or wrist to touch the mouse pad causing the cursor to jump when he is typing. He always insists its the laptop and as he wants to use the laptop in his arm chair won't let me plug in a mouse.\n\nHope you guys have enjoy me Dad'isms and IT, I'm sure there's more but I dread the phone ringing and his number coming up. To be fair a lot of the problem these days just require me to jump on with Google Remote my mum can often find a way to negotiate a problem he's having. He did mentioned about plugging the laptop into the TV via HDMI but I'm trying to avoid this after changing source on the TV is only going to cause phones calls :-D",

        "text": "So from 2011-2014, I worked at a website hosting company, and then I quit to be a stay at home mom.\n\n$Host had a bit of a problem with email servers getting blacklisted with 3rd party services such as Spamhaus because spam emails could be traced back to our servers. The way things were set up, we had a large number of servers handling email, and literally thousands and thousands of customer servers would funnel their emails in and out of these servers. With a customer base in the millions, and customer email accounts in the god-knows-how-many millions, you can imagine what a pain it is when one of these mail servers gets blacklisted. Suddenly we’d be getting calls over and over about bounceback emails.\n\nSometimes we would also see email spoofing, rather than an actual hacked account. That one was a little more time consuming to confirm, since it required getting the customer to find the email headers and send them to us.\n\nThe quick solution is to shut down that customer’s ability to send out emails until they fix the hacked account or fix the easily exploited contact-us form on their website. \n\n**Anyway. Fast forward.** I’ve been out of the tech support game for 4 years now, enjoying my time as a stay at home mom. \n\nSister makes a post on Facebook:\n\n&gt; It looks like my Gmail account was hacked. How does this happen? I don’t go to any questionable websites. I don’t understand it. Does changing my password really help at this point? Has the damage already been done? Can anyone give me answers to any of the questions above?”\n\nMy first thought is that her gmail probably wasn’t actually hacked, but that she’s likely a victim of spoofing. “I’ve seen it a thousand times before at %Host.” So I reply:\n\n&gt; Can you post a screenshot of the email headers from one of the emails that someone received from you? It may actually be “spoofing” where the actual sender isn’t you, and they’re editing the email headers to appear as if it came from you.\n\nTL;DR it’s all black magic fuckery to her, no matter how many examples I show her. But she gets the headers back from her friend, so I can finally just get it figured out instead of trying to explain it.\n\nInside the headers I find evidence of spoofing:\n\n&gt; Return-Path: &lt;sister.name@randomdomain.com&gt;\n\n&gt; X-Source-Auth: &lt;user@randomdomain.com&gt;\n\n&gt; X-Antiabuse: Sender Address Domain - randomdomain.com\n\nI screenshot this and go to scribble a red line around these things, and send it back to her saying “yep, it’s spoofed.”\n\n...And while I’m outlining these lines that I was talking about, I see:\n\n&gt; X-Antiabuse: Primary Hostname - server#.$host.com\n\n[My face when...](https://media1.tenor.com/images/51c1d9515f36ed8ae5f0e27d6966433f/tenor.gif)\n\nMe:\n\n&gt; You’ll want to also forward these headers over to tos@$host.com so they can suspend randomdomain.com’s ability to send emails. This green highlighted line says it’s happening from a domain on $Host’s servers.\n\nEmail was sent, mystery is solved, and hopefully, bounceback emails for another few thousand people may be averted in time. (For all I know, that customer’s mail is already suspended, but shhh - let me be the hero,)\n",

        "text": "Inspired by [Streaming Services Require Internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8md57c/streaming_services_require_internet/), I bring you my tale of woe.\n\nA few years back, my mother was \"employed\" by a local businessman who ran his various companies out of his own home.  She evidently did some bookkeeping of some sort for him, and used her personal computer to do so.  Evidently, the guy was reluctant to let my mother connect to his personal network, so he configured her laptop to connect to the $localISP public access points, and used his own UserID/Password to authenticate past the captive portal.  The ISP in question happens to broadcast their \"Public\" access point from almost every residential Router/AP combo that they install, so my mother had internet access seemingly everywhere she went.\n\nFast forward about 3 years, and Mom moves into my apartment building.  Naturally, with me being in an apartment 2 floors below her, I automatically become tech support.  Again.  I moved out over a decade ago to escape this!  Regardless, I was able to deflect most of her requests by gently explaining that I'm a Linux Sysadmin, and therefore have absolutely no idea why she cannot do XYZ with her Windows computer.  (Sssh.  That's my excuse.)  This worked up to a point, but eventually her laptop powered off for the last time.  Being that I'm the one who selected and purchased the machine a few years prior, ownership of the problem naturally falls to me.\n\nAfter the machine showed up at my front door, I proceeded to break out the tools and tear it down.  The motherboard's shot.  The main CPU fan hasn't been spinning for who knows how long, the innards are clogged with bed fuzz.  The dodgy power adapter that's serving as her third replacement tests good on my bench after cleaning it up and patching some insulation, but it likely had a hand in the machine's demise.  It's not worth my time to chase parts and attempt to service this machine, so I order a cheap Dell business class notebook off Ebay.  The system shipped without an OS, and I don't own a Windows license.  I throw Ubuntu Linux on-board, give Mom a primer on how to connect it to her network and use it, and shoo her out of my apartment so I can get back to work that actually pays me money.\n\nThe follow-up call comes in promptly.  She can't connect to Youtube.  I try to remote in, but TeamViewer doesn't show her machine online.  I ask whether she's connected it to her wireless.  I get a quizzical silence in response, so I grab another laptop for testing and hike upstairs to check things out.  I ask where her router is - there's not one.  I ask who she pays for service - she doesn't.  It hits me - she's been using $localISP's free-for-customers hotspot feature for years, piggybacking off her former employer's account credentials.  The idea of paying for internet simply never crossed her mind, she's had it everywhere.  I connect the machine, point her to the captive portal, and ask her to log in.  I get a blank stare in return.  She has no idea what the credentials could be.  Her former employer had shut up shop ages ago and even though they were still friendly, he no longer had a login for her to use.  But how had she retained connectivity up until this point on the prior laptop?\n\nI'd always suspected that $localISP wasn't authenticating the captive portal login every time, and was instead likely using the MAC address to whitelist clients.  I rushed downstairs and grabbed the WLAN card from Mom's old laptop, which was in bits on my dining room floor.  I installed a macchanger app, configured the new laptop's card to use her old card's mac, and SUCCESS!  Well...until a reboot.  The MAC address reset every time the machine restarted, or even if the system was powered on for long enough.  Frustrated with troubleshooting my hack, I decided to swap the old card into her \"new\" machine - after living for years with IBM/Lenovo hardware whitelists on my ThinkPads, I thought the chances of success were slim.  But, upon reboot, the machine's (downgraded) network card connected immediately to the $localISP hotspot.\n\nLooking on the bright side here,  I got the significantly better AC card in trade for the  N card I swapped in from the old laptop.  Mom gets to stream Youtube to her heart's content, and continue her apparently eternal free ride on $localISP's network.  I just pray that that machine never breaks.",

I discover that they have a booster signal for a particular phone provider, but it's weak as hell and unreliable as anything. \n\nI advise them to negotiate to have internet provided to them by the hotel or provision their own, this advice falls on deaf ears and Financial controller says they have a 4G site kit and let's test it out (because it's free).\n\nI advise against it, but test it out, it's unstable as hell, but it works. I advise not to rely on this, and to negotiate internet connection with the hotel. I speak with and email all of the people involved advising to TEST THIS OUT and LET ME KNOW the results, so I can provide recommendations (which is to provision their own internet).\n\nSo a week or two goes by, people start arriving to the office, and our helpdesk gets complaints.. site users start emailing my boss saying this is \"unacceptable\" and I get \"What the hell is going on over there\" emails. I again, engage all of the stakeholders, repeat the previous message that this was a TEST PHASE because IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and we SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask .. \"What about the guest WiFi network?.. can't we use that?\"\n\nI advise THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PRINT WITHOUT SWAPPING NETWORKS and YOU SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but I go out.. find the PUBLIC WiFi signal isn't strong enough, and the GUEST network requires authentication. I leave stating they need to get a Guest logon for me to test, they say they will and get back to me, I leave.\n\nThey complain, saying the internet still isn't fixed and this is unacceptable, I say do you have the guest logon?, they say yes, I say have you tested it, they say no. So I go out, test it out, it's weak and pretty crappy, but usable.\n\nI let all the stakeholders know, yes the guest network works but the signal isn't the best, you SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask.. what about the public network..  Joe bloggs tested it and said it's fast, I say the signal strength isn't enough to reach in the office, so they contact the hotel asking for it to be extended.\n\nSo today, after this painful journey, the hotel agrees to be able to move the WAP that broadcasts the PUBLIC network (very fast) so we go out. My tech moves the WAP to near their office, connections are great, full signal strength fast internet, great. Only problem is they have to disconnect to use their printer, I have explained this several times and everyone has agreed.\n\n  \nExcept for new Site Forman, never been involved, never spoken to anyone, self appointed head honcho says to my tech \"You aren't going anywhere till you fix this, if you can't fix it I'll find someone who will\". \n\nBaffled my tech calls me saying that new site forman is demanding we fix it (Fix what? I am thinking.. this is exactly what has been agreed to). I call Financial controller to get this guy in line.. he is on leave, I call office manager who said \"I don't really remember what the issues were.. could you go over it again?\" \n\nSo I have to call this guy, listen to his heavy breathing and completely oblivious ramblings like Donnie from the big lebowski completely out of his fucking element, and I have to explain to him the realities of life. Then, out of the blue, he says he has approval for running cables out of the basement, into the golden sunshine to allow a mobile signal booster to be installed (this has been denied for two months that this was possible). So while I am organizing this, he sends an email to all people involved advising this is SUPER URGENT and UNACCEPTABLE and that the current options WILL SIMPLY NOT WORK.\n\nAfter being ignored every step of the way, being forced to work with solutions that I KNOW will fail, and finally dancing to the beat and getting exactly what was agreed upon working, I get an ear full from someone who had not the time nor the inclination to get involved. Pure frustration in it's finest form, I have flash backs to that phone call that started with \"We are going to be building an office in the basement\" and which I had of hung up right there and then and gone on leave for two months.",

Occasionally; on days when sales traffic is very slow or when technicians call in sick, I would support our coveted \"Intellectuals\" at the rear of the store; at the \"Intellectual's Table\" to deal with customers that booked appointments to get their pProducts repaired.\n\nBeing on the floor, I knew that most of the customer issues involved forgotten passwords or an accidental toggle of the Do Not Disturb key, and as such typically lamented supporting the Intellectual's Table since it meant guaranteed frustration dealing with non-issues or people that claimed their devices were \"defective\" when they've blatantly smothered it in the pool.\n\nOn one of these days, two of Intellectuals were sick and I stepped in to help a lady with her pPod. The lady looked middle-aged, frail and incessantly confused about something. I pull her appointment up on the pPad and the note read \"software/content syncing issue.\"\n\n\\--\n\nSo I sat down in front of her and asked her what the issue was, and then this conversation took place:\n\nMe: How can I help you?\n\nLady: Oh, I've been trying to add this song from my pBook to my pPod.\n\nMe: Okay...

I can help you get it synced.\n\nLady: Well that's the problem.\n\nMe: ???\n\n*\\*Lady proceeds to carefully unplug the USB cable from both devices and hands it to me gently.\\**\n\nLady: The song isn't on my pBook anymore, and it's not in my pPod either.

        "text": "Hey r/talesfromtechsupport! I started visiting this sub a couple of years ago when I accepted a position as a regional IT manager for a transportation company. We have a number of different systems that are legitimately difficult to use, mostly because our company infrastructure is awful, but that's a tale for another time. I admin, provide support and often jump in to help users if they get behind on something or aren't capable of doing it themselves. Today I had to help a user get through a procedure that is conducted quite frequently, payroll. You see, we have a time clock web application that interfaces with the physical clocks where employees punch in and allows the location payroll supervisor to edit hours, add vacation time, track sick days, ect. It isn't the greatest system in the world, but it works.\n\nThe characters in this tale:\n\n$PS - Payroll supervisor that has been on site for nearly ten years and has been using the time clock app for 3 years.\n\n$GM - General manager of the facility, helpful guy\n\n$me - I bet you can guess\n\nme:  This is the66fastback\n\nPS: Hey the66fastback, this is PS from \\[location\\] I'm having an issue with payroll, can you help me?\n\nme: Sure PS, what's going on?\n\nPS: Well in the payroll report, I set up the dates and then I change the name for the CVS file\n\nme: -to myself- It's .csv, but whatever\n\nPS: But after that where it used to give the the option at the bottom of the screen to save, its not there no more.\n\nI remembered at this point that I had instructed PS to start using Chrome in place of IE a week ago when they were having issues with the web app lagging. This fixed this issue right away and I hadn't heard anything else about it. As I'm sure everyone here is aware, in IE a user is given the option to choose where to save a downloaded file, in Chrome, the file is automatically saved to Downloads.\n\nme: PS, I suspect this isn't an issue with \\[time clock app\\]but an issue with your browser. Which one are you using?\n\nPS: Uhhh, I don't know.....\n\nme: Chrome? Internet Explorer? Firefox?\n\nPS: Its just, I don't know how to save it now, it used to say \"Save As\" but now it's not there.\n\nme: I understand PS, I think your file is in your Download folder now, did you click \"Download\" at the end of your process?\n\nPS: I uhh... I did the date and then changed the name and now I can't save it. It used to just show up on my desktop when I was done. \n\nme: Ok PS, if you have \\[time clock app\\] open in front of you, take me through it from the beginning, step by step and I'll direct you once we get to the part where you're having issues.\n\nPS: I change the date, then I change the name and now I usually save it\n\nme: Did you click \"Download\" after you changed the date? (Download is in the middle of the page)\n\nPS: The only \"Load\" on the page is at the top right\n\nme: -starting to get a little irritated- No, PS, \"Download\" you have to click \"Download\" and then your file will be in your download folder\n\nPS: You want me to open my folders.... in the cloud?\n\nme: No, just on your Desktop, same as always\n\nPS: ............................................ \\*dial tone\\*\n\nI waited for a second, thinking surely she hadn't just hung up on me, and then called back.\n\nme: Hey PS, I think we got disconnected, did you figure it out?\n\nPS: Oh, I thought I put you on hold. I went and got GM and told him what you had said and it he figured it out.\n\nme: \\*face desking hard\\* Ok, well have a nice day PS.",

        "text": "So I flew back home a few weeks ago to visit my mom.  She had mentioned that her computer (stock '09 Macbook) was really slow.  No problem, I am glad to help.  The machine had 2GB ram and a 5400 rpm drive, so I brought a spare 8GB of ram and a 240GB SSD. I also planned to upgrade from 10.6 to 10.13, so she can run the latest and greatest.\n\nWhen I arrived, we took a look together and she's correct: the machine was *crawling*.  Well, we all know that the first step is a reboot, to which Mom immediately objects:  \n\n\n\"You can't reboot it and you can't quit Firefox!\".    \nMe: \"Why not?\"  \n\"Because I'll lose that video of when your BIL proposed to your sister!\"\n\nIntrigued, I switched to Firefox and sure enough, there it is in a tab.  \n\n\n\"Mom... how long have you had this video opened?\"\n\n\"Since it was sent to me.\"\n\n\"So, like, two years ago?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds about right.\"  \n\"And you haven't rebooted or even closed Firefox since?\"\n\n\"I can't, otherwise I'll lose the video.\"  \n\n\nOMG  \n\n\nI *do* see her logic: The 4k video itself would not play directly on her dated computer.  The browser was doing something to make it playable.  My BIL had said he would eventually take the video down, so she figured if she just left it open, she'd always have it.  The video file was over 1 GB in file size alone, and had been hogging her ram for literally years.  Not to mention all the memory leaks compounding the issue.  \n\n\nSo after much convincing,  I assured her that I could indeed get her the video and make it play on her machine without having to leave it open for eternity.  So we rebooted and naturally the machine was faster with the gift of some needed digital amnesia.    \n\n\nTo solve the video problem, I used Handbrake to downsample the video file and placed the file on her desktop, for future use.  \n\nI had already planned to do upgrades as she was running 10.6 and her machine supports 10.13, so I did that too.   The hardware upgrades made a huge difference, of course.  \n\n\nNow she really can run that video forever.\n\n  \nTL;DR:  Mom didn't reboot or close browser for two years; slowness ensued.  \n",

Regardless, it's truly one worth sharing, out of the many, many I wish I could share, and I'll try to do it justice second-hand. \n\nMy partner is a engineer for a large medical records and billing firm. He had a client get bought, and the parent firm was switching their systems over to one of their competitor's systems, so they sent them a data locker with a few terabytes of records. When the locker reached the client, the firm then received a distress call from the client. \n\n$client = client contact, has received the data locker\n\n$hd = support staff receiving the front line call. \n\n$eng = engineer receiving the distress call escalation. \n\nThis is our setup! \n\n$hd: Hello, this is [firm] support, how can we help? \n\n$client: Hi, yes, your data isn't working!  \n\n$hd: Alright, let's try to figure out what's wrong. \n\n$hd is a bit out of their league here, so escalates it to engineering quickly. They're used to resetting passwords and dealing with client interface issues, so this is fine. Engineering then takes over the call. \n\n$eng: Hi, yeah, we are trying to figure out why you're having issues. Can you see any of the file system? \n\n$client: No, it's not showing up! I think this thing [data locker] is busted! \n\n$eng: Well, do you have it connected properly? \n\n$client: Of course I do! I'm sure it's an issue with the device. \n\n$eng: Can you open the device manager and tell me if the device is found by your PC? \n\n$client: No, it's not showing up at all! \n\nMore troubleshooting ensues. \n\n$eng: Well, can you send me a picture of the device? \n\n$client: Sure, but I don't know what good it'll do. \n\nPicture comes through. Data Locker is sitting on top of her PC tower. No cord, no power, simply sat on top. I now have seen a picture of a Data Locker sitting on top of a tower, with the body of the email saying \"I don't know what I'm doing wrong!\" ",

Part of my job is to provide support for our own personal in case they are stuck on some electrical or software problem.  \nNormally I don't speak to the customers, instead I talk to our staff on site.  \n\nDuring the time of this story I was holiday substitution for one of our staff managers (call it *the guy who sends the field techs the next job descriptions and puts their reports in a folder*)  \n$me = me  \n$ft = field technician who's at customers site for regular maintainance  \n$cu = customer  \n\n&gt; $me: Welcome to COMPANYNAME, $me on the phone. How can I help you?  \n&gt; $ft: Hey $me. $ft here. I just arrived at $cu site but everything's dark. Do you know anything about that?  \n&gt; $me: Wait. What do you mean with \"everything's dark\"? Is the machine broken? In the order $cu just wanted to have their regular maintainance done.  \n&gt; $ft: No you don't get me. With everything dark I mean EVERYTHING's dark... Literally. There's no staff here except for the gatekeeper and the whole plant has no power.  \n&gt; $ft: The gatekeeper told me they're on company holiday and the power supply is turned off for maintainance.  \n&gt; $me: I'll call you back, gonna call $cu now what's going on.  \n\nOfc we need power for our machines to be able to do our work. It's not like we could check it simply by looking at it.  \nFurthermore there must be someone of the customers guys around while our tech is working, simply so they can't say afterwards we broke it if something needs to be fixed (we learned that the hard way)  \n\n&gt; $me: Hello $cu. $me here from COMPANYNAME.  \n&gt; $me: $ft just arrived at your site and told me the power is turned off and there's noone around.  \n&gt; $cu: Yeah. We planned the maintainances to be done during our holiday so it won't affect our production.  \n&gt; $cu: I know you guys and $ft. Just go ahead and do your work.  \n&gt; $me: Well... We need the power to be turned on at your site in order to do that. Could you send someone over to turn it on?  \n&gt; $cu: Eeeh. Can't do that.  \n&gt; $cu: We're replacing our transformers and disassembled the old ones. The new ones will be delivered in 2 weeks.  \n&gt; $cu: You'd need to wait until then.  \n&gt; $me: ...  \n&gt; $me: Look sir. We can't do our work without power. I can't let $ft stay at your site for 2 weeks waiting for you to get the power working.  \n&gt; $me: If you can't get the power working there's no chance we can do the maintainance now.  \n&gt; $me: I'm going to cancel your order but you need to pay the travel costs for $ft and the time he waited at your company  \n\nI'm skipping the $cus complaining here, it would be too long.  \nIn short: He doesn't like it but can't do anything about it so I called $ft to drive back home...",

        "text": "Background : I'm still quite new to the tech support stuff. Only been doing it for six months or so now, and my technical background is more hardware than software- I'll happily solder on some circuit boards, but right now, I'm doing Tier 1.5/2 stuff supporting a government facility. \n\nMy facility was in the middle of a tech inventory, which meant by our policies we were going to be on lockdown for issuing or returning computers for a few days. Not really a big deal, as our stuff is (mostly) reliable, and we have a solid team to ensure we're not swapping a good machine for another good machine.\n\nWe are also the kind of facility that requires an Operations Center, the nexus of all sorts of high level, 24/7 manned goodness. People across the world call our OC at all hours of the day and night for any number of things. The government entity I work for has spots all over the world that make the OC a requirement to have manning all the time.\n\nThe second day of our inventory, I got a ticket in for a critical computer in the OC. It controlled some unique systems (Deliberate vagueness here) that were not used anywhere else on site, and possibly across our Gov't Entity. And the problem was, they forgot the bloody login!\n\nPsht, no problem for a mighty IT dude with his wallet of admin credentials. Off I go to the OC to have a whack at this misbehaving machine. When I get there, I find it's an older box compared to most, and I settle in and slap it with my admin password.\n\n*DENIED*\n\nWait, what? I tried twice more, checking my Capslock key and all that, and get denied every time. Before I can really mess with it anymore, LeadMan and TopGun charge into the OC. Both LeadMan and TopGun (LM and TG) are highly skilled in IT, and are the go-to guys for asking obscure information. You know the type I am talking about. Both are solid mentors. LM and TG came because it was a major OC issue, and apparently, the OC had called LM directly to let him know they needed this box up fast as possible.\n\nI was pushed into the backseat (As was right to do on critical stuff) while LM and TG started working. I found out a few things fast from what they were saying- whoever set the computer up failed to set it up to Gov't Entity Standards, and it was not taking any of the default credentials or anything else. LM began to make phone calls to try and prep for a quick swap while TG hammered at the generic admin account with every password he could think of.\n\nLM got off the phone, saying that our many-levels up boss would approve a transfer mid-inventory, but wasn't happy about it. The OC guy asked about the super unique software... which started another round of digging for info. The unique software was nowhere else, but on this machine, and OC guy had no idea where copies were. We sure as hell didn't. OC guy also said the person who put this software on and set this computer up was at some distant base, presently unreachable. TG threw his hands up at this stage, shoving back from the desk and saying he couldn't get in. So I asked if I could try, and got the go-ahead.\n\nI leaned over the keyboard, and then asked the Sky GM for a Computers roll to figure out the password. Sky GM said sure, roll your computers skill, here's all the penalties.\n\n*NAT 20*\n\nThe workstation gave a happy little chime and loaded up the admin page. LeadMan, TopGun, and OCGuy were all staring at me as I threw my hands up and said, in front of the entire OC, \"BOOM! I'm fucking GOOD!\"\n\nBoth my LeadMan and TopGun demanded to know what the password was I had thrown in. I kind of grinned and said \"Well, we're in the Operation Center, so I tried 'operationcenter', and yanno....\"\n\nBlind luck trumped well earned skill, on that one rare occasion.\n\n(We set up a proper admin account on that machine and copied the software to our IT guy stash, just as a post script)",

They both shout \"downstairs\"  I try to explain. Both again shout louder \"downstairs\" so off I go downstairs, and lo and behold, I have to come back up to get the bloody keys....\n\nNgl, this both made me angry, and upset at the same time. This is the main reason for making this post\n\nFor those who care about the outcome, in the end, it turned out that one of the devices had grabbed the IP of the firewall interface. That was then reserved in DHCP, and that device rebooted. That fixed it.",

This story takes place there\n\nMe = Me\nTB = CoWorker who likes to twist his beard. Henceforth be know as TB\nPest = customer with cleanliness issues\n\nWe had a customer come in with his desktop. Now I normally dont greet or take in computers, but $TB was in the restroom so I had to fill in. \n\nCustomer Plops his Ph Desktop on my counter and complains about it not booting. I create the ticket and place it in the back for us to look at when it comes up in the queue.\n\nAbout 3 hours later, $TB calls me and complains that he has noticed a few roaches crawling around the office. I think nothing of it as its been over 2 months since our last treatment and we are due soon. \n\nNot 15 minutes later he screams across the office. I come running over and see around 30 roaches just hanging out on the Ph Desktop. I grab a black trashbag and somehow manage to get the computer in there without being swarm. We sealed the bag and placed it out front. \n\nI called the customer and informed him of the issue. Conversation went something like this:\n\n&gt; ME - \"We found the issue to your computer. The PSU is dead. It died from the family of Roaches living in your computer. I have your computer sealed and in a trashbag outside of your office. You will need to come pick up the computer and have it disinfected and clean before we will attempt a repair.\"\n\n&gt; Pest = \"O really, I could have told you that there were roaches in there. I live in a trailer in the woods. Roaches are a normal thing for me. Why cant you just replace the PSU and give it back to me.\"\n\n&gt; ME = \"I'm sorry, we will not be fixing your computer. I have to call an exterminator to come get rid of our now roach problems thanks to your negligence. You now have 2 options. 1: Come pick up the computer and take it somewhere else, or 2: Come pick up the computer, get rid of the pest problem, and you can bring the computer back, but we will be charging you a fee.\"\n\n&gt; Pest = \"I will be by to pick up the computer\"\n\nCustomer came and picked up his computer. He was apologetic and did come back to us. He made the comment that he appreciated having someone not freak out on him over his roach issue. Honestly, I was on the verge of eating his soul but hey, shit happens right. \n\nHe did pay the pest cleaning fee which covered that 3 months worth of pest service along with the repair so its a win-win right?\n\n\n",

        "text": "I don't know what it is with my company and working with consumers who think [they are entitled to Microsoft Office,](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8qzprs/replacing_your_lcd_screen_would_not_have/) but this particular story happened just a few weeks ago at my current job. Hopefully this is the last Microsoft Office story I have for a very long time. TL:DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this.\n\n# PREFACE:\n\nSo a bit of background information before I get into this story, **you can skip this if you have already read my previous story about MS Office**\\- So I work at a company that sells and repairs computers. Very small company, the computers are more expensive but what we offer with us over places like Best Buy is warranty- free lifetime labor warranty for as long as you own the computer. It's really helpful for a lot of old timers because we're basically their IT Department. Problem is, consumers are stupid so we get stories like this every once in awhile where they expect the world.\n\n# THE STORY:\n\nIt was another beautiful day at work! My manager and I were closing and we weren't too crazy busy during our last few hours in the store, suddenly we get a phone call... he answers it and then gets busy. Suddenly, another phone call- I answer, and boy- was I in for it once again.\n\n&gt;$Me: *Company Name*, this is GrowingTech- How can I help you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: Hi, I have this computer I purchased from you guys, but it keeps telling me I have to activate my Microsoft Office before I can use it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: I can look up to see if Office was included with your computer, can I grab the name on the account?\n\nSo the customer gives me his name, and all seemed normal at first. **In case you don't know-** Office is not a free product. It may have been included on some old computers like Dell and HP back in XP and Vista days depending on what computer manufacturer had what deal with Microsoft, which has caused a lot of people to be pissed when they find out they have to buy it now because the common misconception is that it was once free... no, not the case.\n\nRegardless, I look up the customer's profile. Our database shows a customer's history- every time they bring it into any of our locations, it keeps track and tells us what we did, why it was brought in, if they purchased anything, etc. I see that his computer was purchased back in 2014- wait... the dude is just finding out now he doesn't have Microsoft Office? I put him on hold for a bit and start searching his history, making sure we didn't do a reformat on the computer and never bothered to activate Office- nope- he's only brought the machine in for tune ups- and if you don't know what that is- trust me, it wouldn't have deactivated his Office.\n\nI keep searching, finding that he has had no purchase of Office through us. I take him off hold and tell him my findings- and it went on from there.\n\n&gt;$Me: Hi sir, I am back. I have went through your entire history from when you bought the computer to the last time you came into the company- we have no records of you purchasing Office. You'll have to purchase it in order to get that Activated so you can use it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: But... it's included on my computer! Nobody every told me it was a trial!\n\nActually- unless the person who sold the computer to this guy was a complete moron- we would have told the customer that. But this was 4 years ago, and why he is finding out he doesn't have Office now is beyond me- he apparently doesn't need it that badly but whatever, my personal opinion. Either way- this is the case of the Customer Conveniently Forgot An Important Detail disease.\n\n&gt;$Me: We normally go over this information with our customers, I apologize but you will still need to purchase it in order to use it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: Well because it came included with my computer, I expect you guys to activate it for me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Sir, Office by default of the Windows 10 Operating System comes included as a trial.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: I don't care, I want you guys to give it to me for free because it is on my computer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me (Starting to lose my patience- did I forget to mention that I despise retail?)  : ....Sir, you could go to Best Buy or any other retailer that sells computers and buy a computer from them- but the trial edition still comes included on those computers as well, this isn't any different with our company. Office comes as a trial as part of the Windows 10 OS, you have to purchase it separately- this is the case of whether you go here or another retailer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: I understand that but still- nobody told me about this and I expect compensation for that! Where's a manager?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: He is with another customer, I can take down your info and have him call you when you are free.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Customer: Okay, call me at this number, I expect you guys to make this right- and I expect a phone call tonight.\n\nI get off the phone with the customer, manager gets off the phone shortly after. I tell my manager who is rolling his eyes just about as much as I am at that point. I am so happy to work with a manager who doesn't give away free stuff for the sake of angry customers, he told me he would give the guy a deal and it would be $140, still expensive but not full price either- and we would be losing out a little on the license as we don't have any special deals with Microsoft either.\n\nWell, manager calls the customer back... and what do ya know, he had to leave a voicemail! Customer never called us back and it's been almost a month since this happened.\n\nSo, not the craziest story- just a case of  \"Expressing my Entitlement\" type of story. Still- I hope my next story for this subreddit doesn't include Microsoft Office anymore.\n\n**TL:DR:** Customer wanted a free copy of Microsoft Office because the trial edition was installed by default on Windows 10 and he \"wasn't told\" when he purchased the computer, Office is not included.",

        "text": "Why is 250 an important number? \n\nBecause moving a router 250ft requires shipping it 250 miles away.\n\nITTS - The ISP that shall not be named, remarkably inefficient, significantly lacking in communication  \n\nCART - The Clueless Asset Retrieval Team -  \\*Sgt. Shultz\\* I know nothing! I know nothing! \n\n$Me - Fulfillment expert and problem solver by working with a team of network engineers\n\n  \nSo, we just observed the weirdest and most inefficient process ever seen by some of our most highly-trained logically-thinking network staff. \n\n[Previously on The Cutover](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/87as24/the_cutover_part_1/) we had the ISP - Internet and Telephony Technical Services Inc.  \\[ITTS\\] appear without our knowing for an install of a SIP gateway in the wrong spot 250 feet away from the demarcation point where the phone lines tie into the telephony room. \n\nWe asked them to move it and they never did...\n\n  \nIt's also been radio silence and our joyful and chipper sales rep who never answers emails or phone calls ~~how does he have a job?~~ did not or failed to inform us that ITTS wanted some equipment returned due to the cancelled and restarted SIP project.   \nThis week, we get a box addressed to the Asset Retrieval Rep but with our company address, shipping team is confused because Jan Smithe does not work at this complex. Somehow the ship team extracted from AR that it was from ITTS which then is delivered to networking.   \n\n\nIt gets better.   \n\n\nWe pull the shipment information packet and find an accurately detailed service order and parts inventory sheet, right?\n\nWrong! \n\nExpected weight 80lbs \n\nPart to be returned - Brocade SIP Box  \n\nSerial - None\n\nPart - None   \n\n\nOoookay... nothing ITTS has ever installed would ever come up to be 80lbs, and everything together that makes the SIP trunk work would weigh 20lbs at the most if we pulled the demarc unit, but that thing is bolted to the wall and has Do Not Touch per ITTS all over it.   \n\n\nWe also have 6 SIP boxes installed in the region pending this glacial-speed cutover, the simple question that never got answered - which one?   \n\n\nEmails go out to the ITTS teams, the local sales reps, and directly to the AR rep. \n\nPhone calls ring to busy or voicemail and no one emails, responds or calls us back.   \nWe did get an answer from a tech rep but guess what was in his email? \n\nInternal work order/job numbers, the router hostname, and pretty graphics. \n\nThere was no serial number, no model number, nothing pertinent to confirm or deny whether or not we sent the right stuff back. I told him that without that hostname or more accurate information, we would have had trouble confirming anything. \n\nCalling the aptly named Clueless Asset Retrieval Team reveals that ITTS does not communicate to them what parts are expected to be returned. I encourage them that this whole mess is a waste of our time and we are not responsible for any fudge-ups beyond that. \n\n  \nI included a letter in the box about how obtuse the whole process is and to contact our sales rep if it is wrong.   \n\n\nTLDR - All we need is for ITTS to move a SIP gateway 250 feet away, but how do they want it? \n\nSend it off 250 miles first, then get it back with $Tech1 who loves T1’s.

Maybe even a little heartwarming...\n\nMore than a few years back, I was hired to help teach an acquaintance's parents the basics of computering over the course of a few evenings. They were a thoroughly charming couple in their 70s who had bought new Macs so they could see what this whole computer and internet craze was all about.\n\nIn my first session with Mom, she was doing quite well with the keyboard (she had learned to type back in the days of manual typewriters), but she was taking forever to get the cursor where it needed to be. Natural enough if someone has never used a mouse before, so I didn't think much of it.\n\nCan I just mention here how wonderful Apple's clear buttonless mice were for people with arthritis in their hands? Just squash the whole mouse to click.\n\nAnyway, in the second session she was doing great otherwise, but still having a lot of trouble mousing. I started to pay closer attention to what she was doing.\n\nTurns out Mom was *driving* the mouse around, like a little car. In other words, instead of holding the mouse in a fixed orientation with the cord pointing straight ahead, she was turning the whole mouse and pointing it where she wanted to go.\n\nWant to go left? Point the mouse to the left, start sliding it, and get distressed when the darn pointer shoots straight up.\n\nWhen you think about it, it actually does make a little more sense that you would steer a mouse. Holding a mouse in a fixed orientation and sliding it around doesn't make a lot of natural sense.\n\nWe soon sorted out the issue, but it was a fantastic lesson to me that sometimes the things users do really are 100&amp;#37; totally logical and sensible.",

        "text": "The year was 2014, I had been working 2nd line support for around 8 months fresh out of university. It was the final day for one of our Senior Developers before he left the business, he was handing over a number of products - one in particular was coming to me as I had been supporting it since beginning of my time there - the application was about a decade old, written in ASP Web Forms with a backing windows service to read an exchange mailbox, download attachments automatically and read/process the files within. The client for said application had a requirement in their business to respond to files within 48 hours or they would be fined *per violation,* and because of the requirement to read emails on their server, it was hosted in their data centre, not ours. \n\n**The players**\n\n* $Me/$Op\n* $SD - Senior Developer of $App\n* $DM - Development Manager, $SD and my boss. \n* $CNA - Client's Network Administrator.\n* $CAM - Client's Account manager, his boss. \n\n**Act I - Setup**\n\nSo 08:55 Friday morning. The phone rings, it's first line support saying they have an urgent ticket - not uncommon - I ask who it's for and they say they actually have $client-network-admin on the phone, can he be conferenced in. Alarm bells start ringing, I haven't even had my coffee yet - my PC is still logging in, but I take the call. \n\n&gt;$CNA: Hi, $Op, we might have a problem with $App.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Okay, whats going on  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Well all of the files we've received overnight haven't been processed, they're sat in the inbox.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Oh okay, let me remote onto the server and check it out.\n\nI remote into the server and check out the service logs, endless stacktrace, the job to check the email inbox is continuously failing to make a connection. I check the settings on the app to ensure the endpoint and auth details are correct - no changes or unnecessary deployments made. I ping the mail server and get host unreachable - ah, the mail server is offline. But then I recall $CNA telling me he could see the mail in the inbox, how could he see that if the mail server was offline? I call him back \n\n&gt;$Me: I can see the problem, your mail server is offline, how is it that you're seeing the mail in the inbox?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Which mail server  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: ...what do you mean which mail server...?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Well we migrated the mail server to our new Exchange box last night  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Did you perhaps do this at \\*time logs started throwing errors\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Yeah that sounds about right.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: what did you do with the old exchange box?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Well we decommissioned it  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: You're going to need to restore that server, we cannot read the mail unless we can reach that server  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: We don't have backups, we're deprecating the box - we've been planning this for months, we have some old disk images but we don't have the hardware, we disconnected it from the rack last night, it's an ancient box and needed to be replaced.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Does anybody here know about this? Has $SD been coordinating the migration?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: We didn't think we'd need to $App just reads mail from outlook right? The mail clients haven't updated, we just upgraded from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: I'm going to have to get back to you $CNA. \n\n**Act II - Confrontation**\n\nI hang up and go to $SD who is just chatting with his desk buddies, enjoying the start of his final day. Explain the issue, his jovial expression is somewhat ruined. He goes straight to $DM and explains the situation. A loud \"THEY DID FUCKING WHAT\" booms across the office. $DM calls $CAM and takes the call into the meeting room.\n\nIn the meantime $SD and I work on seeing if we can get $App to start reading using the new version of EWS, as expected the 3rd party library we used to read EWS would not work with 2010 and the version that would work was so vastly different from our current setup that it would require a fairly extensive overhaul of a large part of the system, and by then we had 8 hours left in the working day. $CNA rings my phone I answer and patch in $SD\n\n&gt;$CNA: So I've just had a chat with $DM and $CAM, they've said I should call you guys and see what can I do to help  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Well you can start by restoring that old box - we've got a few hours left, get it back on the rack, boot it up and do whatever you need to do to get that mailbox running.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Ah, well, we've already redirected all of our traffic to the new box. If we boot up the old one all of our users are going to get locked out of their emails.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Can you make it so that only our account is routed to the old box?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$CNA: Sounds like a tonne of work - would it not be easier to just upgrade $App to start using EWS 2010\n\nMy eye starts to twitch, but then (perhaps fuelled by the knowledge that he doesn't have to care once it ticks past 17:30) $SD chimes in.\n\n&gt;$SD: Are you serious? You switched off an entire server which has housed one of the backbone features of $App for 10 years, you didn't tell anybody at our office you were doing this, your business is going to suffer as a result of this - not only is your job probably on the line for this blunder but I've been working with $CAM since this project started, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's going to be waiting in the car park to beat you up if this isn't sorted by CoB. So don't tell me it'll be easier for us to just upgrade an entire system to an untested, unknown framework. Get that server out of whatever skip you threw it in, get it back on the rack, boot it up, migrate our mailbox and tell us when it's ready to use! \n\nHe slammed the phone down, I heard $CNA mention something about giving us an update in an hour or two and he hung up. There was a tense silence in the office when $DM casually said \"Do you feel better now $SD?\". Everybody laughed and $SD relaxed a little. \n\n**Act III - Resolution**\n\nThe rest of the day went somewhat smoothly. $CNA got the server back up and running, it took a few hours to migrate our mail to the old server and $SD, $DM and I did have to design some on the fly solutions to correct some issues which had been caused by failing to *send mail,* as $App for some reason expected everything to work first time, and had no fail safes in place for when things like email servers weren't there. \n\nAt 5pm we switched the whole thing back on and all the mail pieces started to move, our outgoing mail was re-queued properly and all the data fell into place, crisis averted. \n\n$SD, $DM and the rest of our office then promptly left the office and went into the nearest pub. $CAM emailed us at 11pm to say that the mail had finished, thanking us for our help. \n\n**Animal house ending**\n\n$SD - thrived at his new role, we keep in touch on LinkedIn.\n\n$DM - is still as grumpy as ever\n\n$CNA - amazingly kept his job. Thankfully he now informs us every time anything within their server farm changes. He and I have actually become quite good friends over the past 4 years and we have a fairly healthy working relationship. \n\n$OP - I oversaw the upgrade of $App to use EWS 2010, and after a thorough testing process made the switch. At which point the old EWS 2003 box could be safely thrown in the trash. \n\n$CAM - Had a great deal of respect and time for $DM and I since that issue. She may or may not have still beaten up $CNA in the carpark. ",

We are very restricted on money and what equipment we have, contractors and an external company handle 2nd and 3rd line requests. Anything plugged in such as a cable or USB device MUST be approved due to security and ordered only from our contractor)*\n\nSo my service desk had a user walk up about an hour ago and report they were having issues connecting a laptop to a monitor this morning. Could we please provide them with a VGA cable, seemed odd as pretty much everyone uses a HDMI cable or DVI cable with display port adapter The laptops do have VGA but seem pointless given a recent refresh of tech. Being a manager working to a tight budget where by we try not to give out consumables without charging I didn't just want to hand out cables and expect the users to resolve the issue.  We have limited VGA cables for projectors in certain rooms and our external supplier no longer supplies VGA cables. We cannot bring them from outside and plug in either as it's a security breach. Anyway as my team were all busy on other jobs I decided to go and have a look as it was on the floor below. \n\nQuick look and as you have guessed the user has basically gotten what looks like a DVI-I cable and removed the pins to make it fit into a DVI-D to VGA adapter. Needless to say this hadn't worked but the make matters worse they had stolen this off another users monitor. Now two cables down due to damage by user and theft of the original calbe I was left no alternative but to charge the team for two cables and report the damage. There is a funny side to this story! one of the other admin guys in the team who is a gamer and considered \"a computer guy\" had sarcastically told the user you could do this cable modification and had gone for his coffee not expecting the advice to be taken. Needless to say he's going to be known as cable guy from now on.",

        "text": "There's a TL;DR at the end for the impatient.\n\nSo in a previous life, I used to work for a Dutch phone company - a very old and well-known one. I started at the technical help desk for land lines, and later moved to second-tier work, handling tickets that the first tier put in. Mostly these were infrastructure related, so a problem with the line to the customer's residence, or the exchange.\n\nOne story in particular seemed to mystify a number of coworkers, and it mystified me at first until I found out what the problem was. A coworker explained it to me, and I've had the pleasure of explaining it to others since then. It goes a bit like this.\n\nSo the customer is sound asleep at night after a day of working and quality time with their family and pets. They are roaming around in dream land when suddenly, they are awoken by their phone ringing! Who can this be at this hour? When they answer, they hear nobody speaking at the other end. No record of the phone call in the phone, no caller ID. And this starts happening every single night and it drives them crazy, they unplug their phone, or feel they shouldn't and lose sleep... Very inconvenient!\n\nSome customers and/or coworkers would suspect the phone company's exchange is faulty and is sending out weird phone calls because of a bug or something (spoiler alert: it's never that).\n\nHowever, it might be a problem with a company with a shitty PBX that sends out phone calls. There is a call center I know of that had a problem with their queue filling up and when it overflowed, it would dump the entire queue and then start calling random numbers from its history, so this is not unheard of at all. So people would forward tickets to us to see if we could find out who is calling the customers.\n\nSometimes another little detail was added: the phone calls would happen exactly at midnight. Or they used to be but suddenly shifted exactly an hour and now it's still at the same time, only at some other hour. Here's where some of you will have figured out who the mystery caller is.\n\nIs it the ghost of Alexander Graham Bell? Is it the customer's late grandma? Is it a computer somewhere? Is it hackers? None of these: it's the alarm clock functionality built into the customer's phone, that the customer accidentally activated because of crappy UI design of the phone. Once this happens, the phone starts ringing at midnight, because the wake-up time is 0:00 by default. As for the shift in an hour? Daylight saving time.\n\nThe best part is that in some of these cases, the customer would mention this weird bell symbol in their display and it wouldn't clue the help desk agent in (I would be a prime example of one of those agents).\n\n----\n\nTL;DR: mystery calls at night? maybe it's just an alarm clock...",

        "text": "Hey Everyone, I am new here and this is a pretty old story when I was working as a T3 support engineer in a pretty big corporate. You could say *one of the top 5* in the world currently. I hope this is not too long- but I wanted to give as much context as possible. Enjoy!\n\nTL;DR at the end.\n\nA SysAdmin who works in \\[Company X\\] looks after the domain controllers of \\[Company Y\\] opens a ticket with me where we are troubleshooting AD Replication. \\[Company Y\\] is a pretty large enterprise with more than 150 DC's. \\*It's quite overwhelming to tackle replication in such an env, when multiple sites are broken.\\*\n\nI am remoted in and its already been 2 hours on this call because he wants to **\"learn more\"**, and I am all about teaching and spreading knowledge so I don't really mind.\n\nSuddenly, out of the blue this guy starts getting pings from everywhere and emails start flowing in..reporting an issue where no client machine in the domain was applying the GPOs. It's noon for me but for him its pretty late at night.\n\nSo, he asks for my help *naturally* instead of saying \"*ok thanks! we are done here, I'll catch ya tomorrow*\".\n\nI look at **net share** on a couple of DC's and I see SYSVOL is not shared?! I open the SYSVOL folder and there's a ton of morphed folders, and other FRS issues - **it was a mess!**\n\nThis is FRS timeline where - when you needed to get out of this situation the only solution was to [D4/D2](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/janelewis/2006/09/18/d2-and-d4-what-is-it-for/) the DC's.(*for those who don't know what D4/D2 means; in a nutshell you just restore the SYSVOL folder from a good backup.*)\n\nMy shift is about to end, as I come very early in the morning to office. I tell him it's okay just let my team know you have another issue and someone from my team who is in shift will help you troubleshoot this- *just stop* ***panicking -*** Jesus!\n\nI explained him what needs to be done and what the issue was - but this guy is *so* stressed out he didn't understand a single word I said to him.\n\nIt's already beyond my shift and I understood that this guy has lost his cool. So, I take charge and tell him\n\n&gt;Me : \"Sir, you need to calm down, its all gonna be okay. I can fix this for you (*as a professional courtesy*) \"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Just give me a System State Backup of any DC..\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SysAdmin : \"Backup? .. uh.. \\*Takes a moment or two\\* Sure, give me a second.\"\n\n\\*Starts pinging every other SysAdmin on his SLACK\\*\n\n\\- No Response -\n\n&gt;SysAdmin : \" I am pretty sure we backup using Symantec-\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me : \" It doesn't matter, as long as you can get me a SYSVOL folder from yesterday we should be fine.\"\n\n\\* It's 30 minutes now- He is not able to find a good copy of SYSVOL, and I start to realize that he does not have one.\n\n&gt;SysAdmin : \" Please give me some more time.. \"\n\n\\* I mute the phone, and I let my team-mates sitting beside me know that I need one of them to take this over as I am end of shift. As I explain them the issue and people start gathering around I tell 'em\n\n&gt;\" Just so you know guys he doesn't have a backup. \"\n\nEveryone in my team looses it after hearing that - \" Over 150 DC's and N0 Backups?!, Holy shit this admin! \" and out of annoyance start cursing him.\n\n**I come to my desk and I realize my Phone wasn't muted.**\n\nI hushed everyone and I nervously pick up the phone to apologize to him, hoping he didn't hear us as we were discussing this a few meters away.\n\n&gt;Me : \" Hey \\[SysAdmin\\] I am really sorry about that, I just wanted to -\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SysAdmin : Please \\[Guy\\], I am really sorry. Please help me, my CTO will fire me tomorrow morning if we don't get this fixed soon.   \n\\* Starts crying on the phone \\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me : \" Hey HOLD ON! \\[SysAdmin\\] You need to get a grip, we can fix this- it's not the end of the world. Let's see now- \"\n\nThis dude just starts crying on the phone and I was speechless- words escaped my mouth.\n\nBut by looking at the level of impact I would say he had this coming, I felt so much pity and guilt for him, I can't even explain.\n\nSo, I devise a plan of action, asked which DC has the most up-to-date policies- He takes another 45 minutes gives me a DC. I told him to take a nap as it was 3 AM by then for him. Picked his Hub site first where most of his clients were-\n\nMade the good DC as ~~D4~~ *Authoritative* and started doing ~~D2~~ *Non Authoritative* restore on all other DC's.\n\nFixed almost two sites - about 50 DC's, woke him up- told him what's what and how to move on with this. Handed the call to my after-hours engineer and went home.\n\nNever had an interaction with the fellow again.\n\n\\[TL;DR\\]\n\nA SysAdmin starts weeping on the phone and looses all of his life's motivation.\n\nHey SysAdmin's out there ! Please make sure you take at least 1 System State Backup daily - If not system state- Take an AD aware backup.\n\n*You never know when things can hit the fan.*",

        "text": "Just finished up a fun little ticket, and thought I'd share with y'all in TFTS. \n\nThe cast:\n\n$Me: yours truly\n$NMB: No MailBox, the poor user who is the reason this tale exists. They're an employee of one of my favorite clients (read: easy tickets and friendly, so easy money).\n\nI was just wrapping up a ticket for another client when my phone dinged. It was from $NMB, and contained a screenshot of the error message, (another reason they're a favorite, they don't just click past errors) followed by the words, \"I think I broke something, help...\". The error states that Outlook cannot start because the PST file is missing. The file path is the usual \"C:\\Users\\$NMB\\Documents\\Outlook\\$NMB@company.pst\".\n\nI finish up my previous ticket, and login to $NMB's computer remotely. We start a chat session once I'm logged in.\n\n&gt; $Me: *seeing that the error is now gone* Okay, $NMB, I don't see the error, I'm going to try and open Outlook.\n\n&gt; $NMB: Okay. I was just scanning documents and renaming them before sending them out, but Outlook won't open now that I'm done scanning.\n\nI click on the icon, and sure enough, the same error pops up. Navigating to the Documents folder yields a screen full of PDF's and Word docs, and probably 50 folders. Within the Outlook folder is probably a thousand more PDF's, each with a name like \"YY-MM-DD - Client A - Bid for Project X.PDF\". Overall, not a bad naming scheme, but why are they in the Outlook folder?\n\n&gt; $Me: Why are these all in the Outlook folder?\n\n&gt; $NMB: Oh, I put docs in there after I've emailed them, so they're out of the way. I don't like my Documents folder all cluttered (ironic since there's probably 150 files in it still).\n\nWhile they're typing, I sort through the files in the Outlook folder. Sure enough, there is no file named \"$NMB@company.pst\" in there, so next is sort by file type. No PST files in the folder, damn.\n\n&gt; $Me: When do you rename the files, before or after you email them?\n\n&gt; $NMB: Oh, after! This is just my way of keeping track of what was sent when. I wouldn't send it like that! \n\nI set to scrolling through the folder, and notice that the file extensions are showing as part of the file name. One file stands out, as it has no file type. Its 46GB size fuels my suspicion of what's happened. Sure enough, it has the same naming scheme as the rest of the documents, \"YY-MM-DD $NMB@company\"\n\n&gt; Me: $NMB, I think I found the issue. *highlights suspect file*\nDid you rename this file?\n\n&gt; $NMB: Yes, I didn't like that it was the only file without the right format to it, so I renamed it.\n\nI sigh, and rename the file back to \"$NMB@company.pst\". Outlook happily opens without a hitch.\n\n&gt; $NMB: Thank you, my email is back! What'd you do to fix it?\n\nI point out the name of the file and it's importance, and ask that $NMB not rename it. \n\n&gt; $NMB: but then it's going to be the one file without a date on it! Can you just change it so it has today's date in the name like I did?\n\nNow, normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, as while it's unusual, it's a harmless request. However, since $NMB has decided that the Outlook folder is used for storage, I opt for another approach.\n\n&gt; $Me: Would you mind if I just move it to another location, so it's not mixed in with your files at all? That way you can't accidentally rename it later.\n\n&gt; $NMB: Will my email still work?\n\n&gt; Me: ...yes...\n\n&gt; $NMB: Okay, as long as it works, do your thing.\n\nAnd now $NMB's email is tucked away in another folder, away from files they normally use. Outlook has been remapped to use that location. I'm just hoping the saying, \"if you make something idiot-proof, the world will make a better idiot\" won't catch up to me on this one...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I work in the entertainment industry. Not in top-class theatre like Broadway or West End (but I can dream!) But my company likes to pretend we’re Broadway quality. My typical role is ~~backstage ninja~~  ~~professional grunt~~ stage hand, but I’m training up to Light Pro if I can ever get my mind around maintenance. Without breaking it.\n\nA quirk of the theatre I work in is that we have three different types of “events”; our Company-provided Shows that run regularly, guest entertainers that appear once or twice, and outside group events. Typically, it is the last that provides the biggest headache, as these poor outside groups do not understand the complex concepts of theatre, or even the more basic ones. \n\nTake $ForeignGroup for example. Many of our groups will have some sort of rehearsal or pre-inspection to learn the venue, discuss set up and configure settings. Not these guys. They just showed up, set up two laptops with a splitter provided by our A/V team and expected it to work. And then complained because they couldn’t hear anything. At least, not like they expected it. ($ForeignGroup, fittingly, only spoke a few words of English. Contrastingly, the Backstage team only spoke a few words of their language. This made communication…difficult. Also, they didn’t provide a technical rider in English so we had to guess changes in parts of their presentation/speakers as the conference ran. Live.)\n\n*A brief aside to explain sound systems; In your typical theatre, most of the speakers/monitors will be pointed out at the audience. There are a select few pointed at the stage or to the wings so that the cast and crew can hear themselves and the music, but only a few so that we can still hear each other and not kill our hearing after three months of show. Most speakers only throw sound in a single direction; you can try this yourself with a computer speaker. Stand in front of it, to the side, then behind it. A sound level will sound different between the Wing, the Stage, and the Audience despite showing one level at the desk. All sound levels in the system are controlled from the Sound Desk, which is out in the House. What the Sound Tech hears, you hear.*\n\n$ForeignGroup did not understand this. They would turn to me (The backstage grunt assigned to communicate between $LaptopLady in the wings and $SoundGuy at his desk) frequently and ask for us to turn up the volume because “They couldn’t hear it.” They would turn the sound on their laptop to the maximum level, blasting any poor soul sitting out in the audience while it remained blissfully quiet backstage. Our poor system was being strained to the breaking point because our $SoundGuy couldn’t anticipate the $LaptopLady changing the volume on her laptop and adjust accordingly.\n\nI finally had enough. I wiggled between the tables and the wall to a portable audio hotspot that sat in a corner. It works like the overhead speakers attached to the system, but this one has its own volume control. I turned the volume knob just a tad, until its level reflected the level of the sound onstage.\n\n&gt;$LaptopLady: That’s perfect! Thank You!\n\nThat’s right. I just fooled the $ForeignGroup into thinking I controlled the entire sound system with a single knob. I hung my head, updated $SoundGuy, and tried to contain myself every time $LaptopLady adjusted her own volume to mute a video when it finished rather than let our sound guy do the work. They were frustrating for other reasons, but this was the one that blew me away. \n\nAfter that I figured out how to communicate the concept of Sound to other groups in simple English. (And thankfully, with our amazing translator/Group controller in the room-she’d stepped out when I was trying to work with $ForeignGroup.)\n",

        "text": "First, a little background.  I am currently a SharePoint/O365 Admin who also is the SME for OneDrive for Business (yay) at a small  consulting firm. Most of the tickets I get are users who don't fully understand how to best use OneDrive, so they're a relatively quick fix.\n\n$me- me\n$masters- extremely educated user\n\nPreface- I remoted into her computer a few minutes before while I was finishing up a previous meeting before calling her.\n\n&gt;$me- \"Hello, this is zeke48 from information services, I am calling you in regards to ticket, do you have some time to discuss it?\"\n\n&gt;$masters-\"Yes, of course. So, just wanted to let you know that I have a Masters degree in Computers Science, so I know how to use computers.\"\n\n&gt;$me- \"...(actually speechless for a few seconds) Of course, so whats the issue?\"\n\n&gt;$masters- \"I can't see the files my teammate shared with me.  I have to go through my email to open up the link thing and it's not convenient.\"\n\n&gt;$me- \"Ok no worries, if you navigate to your OneDrive page, you'll see a 'Shared with Me' tab on the left side. All of the files your colleagues share with you are on this page.\"\n\n&gt;$masters- \"That's it?  I could have done that. Why aren't we properly trained on how to use these applications?\"\n\n&gt;$me- \"We offer webinar training once a month, if you'd like I can-\"\n\n&gt;$masters- \"I don't have time for trainings!  I am incredibly busy with all of my client work.  I need you to show me everything.\"\n\n&gt;$me- \"Well, I have back to back meetings for the rest of the day, so it will have to be tomorrow.\"\n\n&gt;$masters- \"I need training ASAP.  Can you push any of your meetings back or something?\"\n\n&gt;$me- \"This is how I learned...\" *opens Google on her machine, type in 'How to use OneDrive for Business', and clicks on first link, the actual Microsoft article on how to use OneDrive for Business, with a quick video*\n\n&gt;$masters- \"Oh\" and hangs up.\n\nHer masters degree apparently did not have a course in proper Google usage.  \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those asking, she did in fact say “Computers Science.”",

        "text": "Although I am a Dev I occasionally do field support for one of our contracts, I cover the North of the UK while a counterpart in the South covers the other half of the country. \n\nSomebody called the helpdesk saying that their PC was displaying system time 01/01/2000 whenever they logged in, and it meant security certs weren't valid etc. It's becoming a more common problem as some of the PC's have been around a decade or so and the CMOS batteries are starting to die, so the clock resets every shutdown. The sites can reset the clocks themselves but as its a continuous problem we eventually need to replace the battery. While the tech setup is really low key - it's a medical workstation and has a fairly high impact and when a site can't access the system and needs to use the contingency, the slowdown in productivity can have some fairly dire medical consequences. \n\nOn this occasion the site was slap bang in the middle of the country, technically I was closer by about half an hours drive away, which would be an all day trip out of the office - driving hundreds of miles to replace a battery. The guys on 1st line sent the CMOS battery ahead of time in the post, then called the local IT for the site and asked if they could spare a hardware tech to come out and replace the battery. They refused. We told them we accepted liability for any damage to the machine, and if they broke the PC entirely we'd have to come out anyway to replace it - so either way we had nothing to lose. They still refused on the grounds it wasn't their kit. \n\nAnnoyed (but not surprised) I called the site to arrange a time I could go out and replace the battery myself. This is when I encountered something that had not happened before. I spoke to the medical professional - lets call him John -  explained the situation and asked when was best to come out; his response shook me. \"Just the battery on the motherboard? I've done that before - do you mind if I just have a go?\" I said yes, as whether he broke the machine or not I'd need to be heading out. \"Give me a few minutes, I'll go find a screwdriver\". \n\nHe called back a few minutes later saying that he'd done the switch and the machine was keeping time; but he'd ring back next day to confirm it was working. Called me this morning first thing and said the PC was working fine, and we could close our ticket.\n\nWhile this story doesn't really have a funny punchline; I thought I'd share it - because in tech support sometimes you just need that glimmer of hope that one day you will get a *John,* somebody who not only understands but cooperates and makes the job just that little bit easier. Thanks John. \n\nTL;DR: Local IT wouldn't help because it wasn't their job - hero user fixes it himself. ",
