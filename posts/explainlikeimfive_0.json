        "text": "I've read some other threads on this topic, but I still don't get it. I don't understand it from several points, if someone can answer it point by point then maybe it would make more sense to me: \n\n1) The original assumption that we have a list of all natural numbers mapped to a list of real numbers between 0 and 1 doesn't make sense to me: can't we just do this 1 -&gt; 0.1 | 2 -&gt; 0.01 | 3-&gt; 0.001, so we just keep adding a zero for every number number somewhere down the line it would be 148915710 -&gt; 0.000000000000000000000001 and so on to infinity. Since the number will never overflow, doesn't that mean that it's meaningless to even try to think of number such as 8249273419238 -&gt; 0.2? How would we ever even get there?\n\n2) Going past that, if we somehow have a map of all natural to real numbers, and we construct a new real number by taking a diagonal and adding one to it, why can't we just also add 1 to the natural number set to accommodate the new real number?\n\nOverall I think I'm just confused by the very notion of what it means to create a map of an infinite set, it seems like a contradiction - in my mind there can be no map to begin with because a map requires a finite set.",

She says she does lots of work managing “the societies”. She manages holdings and subsidiaries. She also does some employment and labor laws, NDAs. She manages the trust and existing trusts and all the agreements and operations regarding it. She is an in-house lawyer and she manages some day to day tasks.\n\n\nAll of these words are foreign to me and I’ve just written that down but I’ve got no clue what they mean. They are super abstract concepts since I have never had anything to deal with that.",

        "text": "I know the basics about big data and activity tracking, but am constantly gobsmacked by the accounts that Tik Tok, in particular, suggests for me to follow. They somehow recommend people that I seemingly have no digital connection to nowadays (social media or phone contacts), but did know approximately 5-10 years ago. With other social media platforms, I can figure out how these recommendations are sourced, but Tik Tok continues to stump me. I have included a few examples below. \n\n1. A girl that I was in a mutual Twitter following with 8+ years ago. I deleted my account in 2015. I do not have a connection with her on my current social media platforms (Snapchat and Facebook), and I do not have her phone number. I do not believe I ever did. She lives far away and we do not know any mutual people.\n\n2. A guy who lives in my city and I hung out with twice, 7 years ago. I did have his phone number and an iMessage conversation together at the time, but I have not had his number saved in years and started utilizing iCloud after. I also used to follow him on Instagram, but deleted my account in 2017. We do not have mutual Tik Tok followers, but could very well know the same people IRL.\n\nHow does Tik Tok source these scarily accurate account recommendations when we seemingly have no digital connection nowadays? TIA!",
