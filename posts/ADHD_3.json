        "text": "Will try keep this brief (lol).\n\n\nI'm facing a delay in getting my vyvanse 70mg refill. It's a combo of both my fault and my circumstances. Ordered a little late, plus pharmacy not got it yet and it's collected for me then sent to my current dwelling abroad (done this for almost a year). So by the time it gets collected and sent, I'm looking at a where from 3-7 days without my meds if they are in by tomorrow and sent.\n\n\nI basically rely on my meds. I can deal with being less capable and less controlled with my focus, what I'm really dreading though is that the meds are vital for my mood regulation. Even with meds my mood is very low, I'm very lethargic and flat mentally. Until my meds kick in properly I have to grin and bare life and the crushing feeling of pointlessness and negativity and endure it knowing that it will subside once meds take hold. I take a day off every few weeks to reset a bit and most of that day is spent with me being exhausted, sad/consumed with depressive thoughts, and apathy to anything normally positive or uplifting. I know things that should be good or that I should react positively to but tbh I'm no fun to be around and feel numb or empty to everything. I dwell on the hardships in life and all the difficulties of my situation, I get lost in thoughts of the past, worries of the future and cannot force myself to be present. That's just the nature of having a break though and it pays dividend overall as the renewed impact of meds after make it worthy.\n\n\n\nThis is going to be a shitemare, I run out on Saturday. Sunday will be rough but it's OK as Sunday I have no real responsibility to attend. Monday on though I have to be studying intensely and learning for an exam next month that I admittedly haven't been doing as much as I should even on meds. Not only that, I'm due to get going on some outdoor gardening work as the season starts and I'm relied upon to get things ready for clients. I've not done labour all winter and have stopped caring about that pursuit as I've had a change in direction due to life circumstances (my dad is terminal in Scotland and wants me to take over his business in mortgage and financial advice which is what I've been studying for). \n\n\nSo, does anyone have tips or advice that I can try to keep in mind for when the meds run out?  I am petrified of my mindset, mood and drop in functionality, drive and motivation. Please bare in mind that I'll be in a bad place mentally and any advice or tips need to be conscious of that (so things like exercise will help etc although a true fact, won't be something I'll be able to implement in my 'everything is pointless' gear). I hope this doesn't sound like an impossible task or ask!? I don't know what to do, I can see the storm on the horizon and I really want to be ready for it if I can.\n\n\nIf you have gone through similar or can relate to this and have experience with med continuity issues please let me know what works best for you to ensure it and keep going.\n\nAlso, wish me luck. I'm going to need it.",

I think part of it was that the work was just easy for me, so I was able to kind of bs my way through it. Doing it last minute worked, and I didn’t need to study much.\n\nBut I felt really off in college and things came crashing down. Everything was way harder, and doing last minute work constantly was a serious struggle. I graduated with a decent GPA, but there was some incredibly tough semesters I could not focus at all. This was when I really started to notice my problems.\n\nOnce I hit the work force, I’ve struggled at every job I’ve had. I have a hard time keeping deadlines, staying focused in zoom meetings, standing around in one spot, learning new things visually, ect.\n\nI recently got laid off from my job because they switched me around to a new position 3 times since being there in under a year, and I couldn’t keep up with learning that many new things that quickly.\n\nAs an at will employee, I can be let go for any reason. It sucks, but it happens. I don’t want the same issues to continue in future jobs. But I also didn’t know about my diagnosis in college and most of my past jobs.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to better focus at work? What to do when they are struggling to learn new work? \n\nI feel very lost with having ADHD because most people I know have had it since children, or are male. And everyone is one stimulants to help them. I can’t take stimulants, so I’m on Atomoxetine.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "So, over the past year I've figured out a lot about myself, some of those things being I-ADHD and AvPD tendencies.  Fairly certain traumatic events have resulted in the conditions for AvPD to develop and my undiagnosed I-ADHD mind added fuel to that fire. \n\nOne aspect of this is \"fixations\".  Basically learning a new skill or hobby, shaping my entire life around it, buying things related to it, and getting good at it.  Doesn't help that I have a music education degree and I'm good at breaking things down into fundamentals.  The rush of dopamine in the early stages of learning a skill/hobby is great.  Downside is that as soon as I hit the plateau of improvement where consistent long term effort is required, my brain wants nothing to do with it.\n\nThis is incredibly frustrating when I have real long term goals that I would like to achieve.  When I try to do things that my brain isn't completely consumed with, my ADHD symptoms beat me into submission and it becomes impossible.\n\nMy therapist explained to me that there is a certain part of the brain linked to skills/processes like this that is also susceptible to addiction.  So, I'm basically addicted to the process of learning a new skill/hobby.  It's this fucked up coping mechanism fueled by ADHD, and entangled with AvPD.  It's hard for me to wrap my brain around it because I don't know how to quit being addicted to something as general as \"processes\".  There's no way to quit that cold turkey.  But I guess doing it all at once would be antithetical to what I'm trying to achieve anyway.\n\nSo, I'm working on trying to find happiness in long term, incremental gains.  Ten hours over the course of a week is more fulfilling than ten hours in one sitting, due to consistency.  I'm also trying to have multiple projects going on at once, doing just an hour or two of each in a day, to keep my brain from sucking one thing dry of dopamine.\n\nDo any of you struggle with anything similar?  How do you find comfort in the long term processes?  What have you done to help overcome this?",

I was still able to finish my apprenticeship in IT sector but i still struggle with working. finding a job was really easy to me but even how great my coworkers or the job was, i struggled to get my work properly done. A lot of times i make a lot of mistakes, have issues with planing and time. I know that my knowledge is pretty great but i cant use with my work. so i went to a Psychiatrist and got finally an answer, what is wrong with me. For years i didnt know, what was wrong with me.   \n\n\nTo this date my CV had a lot of job changings. i never worked longer than 1 year at the same company. Jobs felt to get boring after a few months and i tried to keep up the motivation, but no chance. So i got prescription. Now it kinda works out a bit. im in a well paid position and even with a lot of struggle i still face in my life i finally reached a point where im still stressed but its not that worse.  \n\n\nBut what makes me very furious, is that my family still dont understand what im struggeling with. My Brother still thinks im useless no matter whats to do and all ive heard from my mother after telling her, that everythings get in the right direction, she told me: \"im glad that you finally grow up.\"   \n\n\nI had massive depression the last few years and fought through it and they still treat me like a fcking child. They even keep me out of important family discussions like what to do with my grandma (shes 92 and suffering from alzheimers disease).   \n\n\nI am really done, trying to convince them, that i just have adhd and its not my fault, but in their eyes im just trying to make excuses. I really think about breaking off contact with family.",

        "text": "I’m a 32 year old woman who was only diagnosed with ADHD this year. I’m an LISW-S and work in pediatric mental health. I have multiple health issues (hypothyroidism, overweight by 150lbs, food allergies/stomach issues, and insulin resistant PCOS). I’ve also been diagnosed and treated for anxiety, ptsd, and depression since I was in high school. \n\nI feel like I spend so much time and energy on trying to find a balance between these multiple diagnoses and medications that I always feel like I’m failing. My symptoms are never 100% balanced—ever. My entire life I’ve felt some level of exhaustion, anxiety, sugar cravings and abnormal eating, or difficulty being productive. \n\nI never even considered ADHD for myself because whenever I got stuck in a loop, couldn’t motivate myself, tasks piled up, etc I always just pinned it on my depression/anxiety or my lack of physical energy from PCOS/Thyroid. It wasn’t until I was describing to my therapist how some mornings I sit on the side of my bed feeling paralyzed by what I have to choose to do next that she recommended I look into it. \n\nIt’s been hard for me to know if this diagnosis is correct. When I take my ADHD meds right when I wake up my morning changes from me laying in bed stuck sometimes to me getting right up, sometimes even cleaning a little. I have this shame that I’m taking these meds only for the energy they give me. And idk if that means I don’t have ADHD and am just basically taking them for the wrong reasons like for them to act like crack to get me going? I told my APRN and she said that if I didn’t have ADHD I wouldn’t be able to sleep while on the meds and I would know. \n\nMy med story has been this… \n(I’m on an anti depressant and mood stabilizer for the depression/anxiety) \n\nShe started me on 5mg dexmethylphenidate. It made me too jittery at weird times. Also had times where I felt socially impulsive and too fast. \n\nMoved to 10mg dexmethylphenidate long acting. I haven’t felt any jitters. I feel completely focused. I feel it wear off around 2 at work and I get so stuck. Unable to complete tasks. Like my brain shuts off. \n\nI told her that and she just moved me to 20 dexmethylphenidate long acting. It’s been an hour since I took it and that hour I felt that same initial jolt. Like wanting to text everyone and share my every thought and wanting to get a million things done. So now again I’m doubting if I have made this up that I have adhd and am really using this for energy. \n\nIf I had a client like this I would say it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. If the 10 worked maybe I have adhd but it’s not severe but just because it isn’t doesn’t mean I have to have shame around it and doubt myself. \n\nUgh. Idk. I’d love some advice from anyone who went through this before. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "TLDR : if you experience this, how you deal with triggers, especially when you often have emotional disproportional reactions to triggers\n\n\nHi everyone, some of my most challenging ADHD symptoms are rejection sensitivity, general hypersensitivity, and feeling my emotions in a disproportionately strong way.  Everything feels very catastrophic and ‘all or nothing’ to me.\n\nThis is really affecting my job. My manager is understanding and supportive, but I’ve realised I’ve been emotionally dumping onto her.  When something small happens (such as someone providing feedback, a meeting not going as I wanted, feeling a bit confused by a task) it knocks my confidence to zero instantly and I feel like I need to act immediately and feel desperate like I need someone to talk to and validate me or give me advice. This has transpired in a way where I will send my manager a long emotional email saying that I think I’m rubbish at my job, I’m really struggling, and think that someone else would do a better job. Sometimes I will also email another colleague with a similar thing if my manager isn’t available to talk. \n\nMy manager disagrees that I’m rubbish and is happy with the work I produce, always tells me she is happy with my progress etc.  When I no longer feel triggered I often feel embarassed by the email and no longer feel the things I said, or at least don’t feel as dramatic anymore.\n\nWork have now extended my probation by 6 weeks as they feel like the job is bad for my mental health (as I often have to take the afternoon off when having a meltdown) and that I am struggling (because I tell them that during my meltdowns). \n\nI need to come up with some objectives of things I can work on over the next 6 weeks to prove that I am a good fit for this job and can work on my problems, one of these things will focus on how I react to triggers like confidence knocks.\n\nI just wanted to know if anyone has any similar experience and whether you had any advice on how you deal with triggers, especially my emotional, disproportional reactions to triggers.\n\nThank you",

But he doesn’t want to be supervised at all times and wants some independence.

Just waited for me to find out. \n\nWe make him fix or pay to fix stuff. That’s kinda the natural consequence. He’s enrolled in drivers Ed for the summer, so another consequence will be that he’s got to be responsible to be allowed to drive. \n\nAny ideas? Any stories of hope that he will one day wake up and stop doing this stuff?  Thanks.",

I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. \n__\n\nIn the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens\n\nI seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying \n\n\nI take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking \n\nEveryone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.\n\nI find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L\n\nI can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. \n\nI also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. \n\nI have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.\n\n\nI go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.\n\nWhen I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. \n\nWhen I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. \n\n\n\nSometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  \n\nBig crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. \n\nI like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.\n\nI get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much\n\nIt’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.\n\nI go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. \n\nI find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one",

I just thought that people here may be able to relate to what I'm about to describe, and may have tools to ease it in some way. \n\nFor the last week or two I've feel like my mind has been put through a salad spinner. Usually I can be spinning multiple 'mind plates' at once, and can sort of tune in and out of focusing on them depending on what i need to do. \n\nBut at the moment, it's like the signal to all my thoughts is scrambled and faint, like my train of thought (like telling myself what I need to do next) has turned into 3 badly tuned radios going at once, and I can't get a single thing down. \n\nSo this morning for example: I need to write an email, make a coffee, have some breakfast, clean out the fridge, pack an overnight bag, do a work task\n\nAnd most of the time, I can sort of mentally pin these into the right order, and while my focusing may be a bit shit and I may spend a lot of time opening reddit tabs or distracting myself, I'm usually plodding in the right direction. \n\nRight now, it feels like all of those tasks are equally as urgent - like the 'do this' drive is pulling me in every direction, and I can't think clearly enough to decide what I'm actually doing. So I just stare into space? And the more I try to hear my thoughts - the less clear they become - like when you try to look directly at a faint light in darkness you can see in the corner of your eye - but when you look directly at it it disappears. \n\nIs this something people with ADHD can relate to? Does it have a name? How the fuck do I get on with my day??",

My portions aren’t as big and I don’t get the intense cravings I used to get. I assume the weight loss is mostly from an increase in metabolism.

If this post is not allowed I am sorry, I read through the rules and wasn't sure; please delete it if nessesary.\n\nI (28m, UK) am currently prescribed 50mg of lisdexamphetamine (also called vivanse or elvanse). The NHS referred me to a private company who are currently managing my medication/dosage until they feel it is correct, after which I believe my GP can take over with repeat prescriptions, though I may be wrong on this. \n\nHowever, the company prescribing me forgot to fill out a new prescription, I've called to sort this out, but I only have 4 days left, and I've been told the medication won't be delivered until next Friday at the earliest , meaning I will run out Monday, and will be without medication for 3 or more days.\n\nIm really worried about having to suddenly stop medication cold turkey as it warns against this online, but it seems I don't have a choice, even minus the withdrawals, I have work and other commitments that not having medication will affect. I know that only a professional can give medical advice, but does anyone have any advice on how to avoid having to go cold turkey?, or at least what to expect if I do have to?",

        "text": "So I had this realization. Some of my anxiety definitely comes the fact that I think so many things at once all the time with very little control over it.\nLately quite a few people have told me that exact sentence : « you think too much »\n\nThe way I’m seeing it right now, it causes two types of anxiety :\n\n1- I think too much about negative things and because I always consider a thousand scenarios, I tend to think a lot about the possible negative outcomes of everything. I guess adhd made me feel like I had little control on life which increased my tendency to focus on negative  thoughts, like a coping mechanisms : « trying to think of what could go wrong to prevent it, or what I may have done wrong to fix it, what I may have forgotten »\n\n2 - I get anxiety from the fact that I have so many good ideas of things I want to do, should be doing, want to implement in my life. So many realisations about myself and the way I could improve my own life. But one idea chases an other and it’s all spinning in my head but I don’t really implement anything nor have time to log it. I get anxiety from this semi-conscious feeling that all those great ideas on how to be better are there in my brain but just fly through and I can never use them, log them, organise them or remember them.\n\nThen I wonder what it’s like to be neurotypical. I can’t imagine them having no thoughts, no constant internal chatter. Maybe they do have constant thinking but it’s much slower, linear and they have more control over it ? The few times I’m having no thoughts are when I phase out staring something. But then it’s more like I’m hypnotised, frozen and not really there. I can’t imagine that being the neurotypical default.\n\nThat brings me to my main point : i have a difficult relationship with meds. When I first took them I cleaned and organised my whole room caught up with so many things I had to do. They felt like a solution to all my problems. But I ever since it’s been unclear if they helped or not. And many times I feel uncomfortable and ill at ease when I take them. Never really managed to decide what dosage was right for me. If what I have to do is clear and mandatory, medication helps. But when I take them on a day I haven’t really planned anything (but still hope to do some productive things and take care of some chores, but nothing specific) i feel weird bad and anxious. \nI am thinking this may be because that constant chatter in my brain is comforting to me. And this calm from the meds leaves a huge terrifying void. Suddenly life feels empty and pointless. I can’t pick a chore to do because none seems to really make sense. I feel like I could virtually do any task, but since none is mandatory right now I feel detached and I don’t do any.\n\nBasically I feel like my adhd hyperactive mind makes me anxious but also is somehow comforting or at least a distraction from the meaninglessness of existence. And in that way it’s comforting.\n\nAdhd people are said to use emotional parts of their brain to initiate actions.\n\nThat resonates so much with me. I feel like my whole life I’ve tried to unleash strong emotions about things to be able to do them. I remember when I got depressed I was telling people: “I don’t even know what to do with my days. I used to do whatever would come to my mind and create great excitement and euphoria. And now that I don’t have excitement, I don’t even know what to do. Going to the cinema feels like an exhausting chore. And nothing makes sense anymore”. \nBefore getting diagnosed, If I wanted to talk through an issue with my partner, I would actually ruminate on the problem in order to get emotionally upset about it again and be able to discuss it (obviously it was generally not going too well and I would Get angry). I could not talk about anything that wasn’t emotionally inhabiting me. \nI think my whole life I’ve only taken any action because of some emotional fuel (whereas it was euphoria, sadness, stress, fear…). So I’ve made it a habit to try and unleash emotions to have fuel to Get going.\n\nThe meds seem to keep emotions under control. But since I’m used to emotions being my fuel. It suddenly feels like I’m tired and I don’t want to do anything. And they make it harder for me to kind of ruminate on an emotion to exacerbate it and make me all excited and euphoric. Basically life can seem super dull on meds and the lack of emotional rollercoaster also feels like a terrifying void. It makes me feel like something is wrong so I panic and get anxious.\n\nThis makes me wonder : do neurotypicals go through life with a calm mind and emotional stability ? How do they not feel like life is meaningless and bland ? How do they find it in them to do the washing up when they have the focus to do so but a flat emotional state ?\nTheir lives must be soooo boring. Are they just capitalistic robots working and doing the things and sometimes having a little fun ? I need constant fun and chaos to keep going. And I miss fun and chaos when on meds. That same chaos that makes me a very nonfunctional person, unable to get control over my own life without them.",

We are now two years together and most of the time everything is fine, but one thing I struggle most is feeling replacable. \n\nThe thing is, she is really impulsive and sometimes when we do stuff I don't really get the feeling that it's important to her if I'm around or not. I don't know, an example is that she asks me to do something and if I don't have the time she immediately jumps to the next person, and because of this quick response I get the feeling, that it doesn't bother her because she has other people to do stuff with. \n\nI've talked with her about it and she says it's not like that, and that she is sad if we don't do stuff together but she quickly shifts her attention from me to another person without even realizing it. So in the moment she may feels sad but is quickly distracted. She knows it too but obviously can't do anything about it. \n\nAnd I'm trying to not take it personally, I know I struggle with insecurites too. But it's been bothering me for some time now, even before she disclosed to me she is suspecting to have ADHD, and I just kinda started to assume I'm not that important to her like she is to me. So I'm not really sure how to handle it, I would appreciate if someone gives me a little bit of infos if this is typical in ADHD and how I can cope with it or if there can be compromises made.",

Today I realized I haven't used focusmate in about 3 weeks due to the break in routine I've suffered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Focusmate, it's an accountability platform where you work, study or commit to goal with another stranger on the internet. You get 5 sessions free a week, or 5$ I think a month for unlimited sessions. You can join groups, such as ADHD or fitness groups, and the platform will try and pair you with other people who are part of that group. \n\nYou can choose sessions of 25 minutes, 50 minutes and 75 minutes. \n\nI've litterally had sessions with people who's goal is just to get through their morning routine, and have used it for similar reasons as well. Get up, shower, breakfast, coffee, etc before booking my next session to start work or get other chores done. \n\nI use focusmate to get through chunks of client work, and the last 2 weeks I've been gaming, youtubing or been stuck in paralysis mode. \n\nI've restarted my Focusmate this morning, and am slowly crawling back into productivity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt costs 5 dollars a month, and I realise now it's been an incredible investment to boosting my salary. \n\nI usually average on $600 a week, and currently am barely scraping 200$, especially when my clients are waiting on deliverables from me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are sitting on the couch this moment, or stuck in robot/analysis paralysis mode, just do this one thing for yourself today. Signup and book a session on Focusmate, and try it out. \n\nDisclaimer: I do not work for Focusmate, nor do I receive anything from this post in terms of compensation. I was just shocked at the financial difference it made to me when not using it, and thought maybe someone else needs to read this. I know how difficult it gets.",

But I figured I'd post this anyway, because it's just done well in the Oscars. \n\nAnd I saw it was on Amazon Prime, so I watched it last night. \n\nIf you haven't watched it already? It's probably worth your time. \n\nIt's a somewhat mad film, with a parallel universe plot, and a big bad trying to destroy all the things. \n\nHonestly, you just just give me Michelle Yeoh doing fight scenes for 2 hours and I'd call it a good film. (One of the things that really annoyed me about the Mummy: Dragon Emperor film - \"just\" getting Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li to fight for 2 hours would have been a way better film). \n\n... but I started to get a really odd suspicion that I was maybe being a bit paranoid since my ADHD diagnosis, and projecting it everywhere, and this film really resonated with that. \n\nTurns out? I was right. The director was diagnosed with ADHD midway through. \n\n&gt; \" The pair initially conceptualized Evelyn as a woman with undiagnosed ADHD, a condition that in a way makes her uniquely equipped to tap into other universes. But, worried about treating the diagnosis reductively, Kwan started looking into it more deeply and was led to a startling revelation: “I basically stayed up until like four in the morning just researching. I was like ‘Oh no, oh no, what the hell,’” Kwan says. “Because it never crossed my mind that I could have ADHD.”\n\nAnd the plot resolution? Well, I don't want to spoiler it, but the 'big bad' is to my mind the personification of Depression caused by ADHD, and the 'finale' was ... actually _dealing_ with it in a way that wasn't actually trite, trivial or pointless.\n\nI think that's just really cool, and I love it. \n\nAnd I do think the acting was pretty solid too, and deserving of those Oscars.",

I have been lived with Auadhd and OCD a vast majority of my life and have coped and functioned relatively well, but lately it seems it’s become more of a struggle to keep my ADHD mask on for long periods of time. I have a few close friends and people who keep in contact regularly (those people know of my issues and can usually tell when my symptoms are peaking - and are generally really good about accommodating me and letting me do what I do) however lately it seems like my ability to keep my mask on while I’m hanging with my friends has become less and less and takes far too much energy. \n\nExample - One of my friends is really extroverted and LOVES bringing attention to himself and has tons of people he hangs out with and when him and I hang out another one of his friends usually ends up joining us (I know most of his friends and get along well enough with them) but an added person to our hang out means more energy is expended from me trying to maintain my mask and not become a totally weirdo —- and this drains the ever living hell out of me and i have to excuse myself from the hang out to go home. \n\nIt’s because of these situations I’ve been more prone to just not hang out with anyone and enjoy my own company (which I do — tremendously) however that also means less and and less interaction from those I do care about oh-so-much. And I know it’s because I’m always disengaging myself from our hang outs or being distant when we do hang out —- it’s not their fault obviously, and lately this has left me feeling like I have no one to turn to for companionship when I do feel up for it. \n\nAm I alone here? Or does anyone else feel like this too?",

No one, family, teachers and especially ME didn’t even think this was an option.\n\nI was a straight A’s student when I was younger because I had to discipline myself like a maniac but despite being overwhelmed a lot and crying while studying I would just push through. Then life happened and my family moved. A lot. Every 6 months for a good 3 to 4 years. Soon after we stopped moving and settled my mom got sick and life stresses and disrupted routines made it hard to manage anything as far as studying goes. Every little distraction in the house would just stick with me and with the financial and emotional pressures I gained weight like crazy. Things got so bad that I had practically no social life studying almost daily and still almost flunked out of university and couldn’t manage the simplest courses. \n\nI decided to take a break help out myself and my family a bit for a few years till my moms health stabilized and we were financially more secure. I managed to not be frustrated from studying ineffectively and lost weight to.\n\nI finally managed to get back to school and moved out a little before COVID and was excited. Routine and structure helped ,but I was still adjusting so I wasn’t at my best but was still hopeful things would get better.\n\nThe second COVID happened my entire routine fell apart again. I just got diagnosed at 28 after my university counselling recommended it and started medication. The difference to my grades and performance is insane. I’ve gone from needing to spend back to back all nighters to manage 70s, to 80s and 90s with little effort.\n\nI feel like I’ve missed out on so much and have screwed up my future with crappy grades that don’t reflect my effort.",

        "text": "I've been taking Adderall (Atomoxetine) for 4 weeks now, well technically 3. On the 4th week I forgot to take it daily because I cleaned up my room and moved the medication, and then proceeded to forget to take it because I didn't see it. I had my appointment on Monday and was asked by my doctor if the medication helped. I was honest, I told her that the first 2 weeks I felt very tired and sleepy, and it was a struggle to take attend the lectures in class. But on the third week I would feel slightly tired but I didn't feel like the medication helped me focus or concentrate better because well, I still struggled with it. There were a few times where I was able to focus and stay on task, but the duration was short, however somewhat frequent though. \n\nSo, I asked once again if I can get diagnosed for ADHD. She said sure, in the meantime she's taking away the medication since it's not helping me either way and she wants to see if I get diagnosed first to be sure if she's helping me for the right thing. \n\nToday is Wednesday, and I realized I spent 6 hours stalling procrastinating accidentally and then I took nearly 2 hours to finish a case study that usually took me 30-40 minutes to do back when I was taking my medication. I've been to my courses and written notes for my lectures, I am not going to lie I still have no clue what was discussed earlier today. I have an exam to take on Friday and I wasted my day today when I meant to use it to study. By the time I remembered and told myself to study, I looked at the time and it is midnight. \n\nI'm in trouble, I think those meds actually were helping me. I'm kicking myself now because I was under this false belief that they would magically fix or cure my inattentive patterns. Now that I look back, they did help me focus more frequently. I still had trouble focusing for a long length of time, but I was able to focus for a good 20-30 minutes at a time. Now, I can't focus for longer than 2 minutes 😅 I feel like I'm back to where I was earlier this year when I went to my doctor to tell her about this before she gave me those meds. \n\nI haven't been diagnosed yet, I would like to make that very clear. I'm a 25 year old and it's rather frustrating seeing medical professionals and medical health professionals brush off my concerns or making me think that I just need a break or a hobby to calm down, implying that if I had ADHD I would have been diagnosed when I was little. I'm not hyperactive, but I have a lot of trouble focusing, concentrating, remembering, and just a lot more. This isn't because I'm addicted to games and am lazy like my parents believe, this isn't because I'm irresponsible like my teachers would say, and this isn't because I didn't put in the effort to try harder. I still remember vividly in high school that I studied for 3 days to take an exam only to barely pass, while my close friend didn't even bother studying and got one of the highest grades. When it comes to college and ever since high school, I have felt like I need to fight for my life to maintain my position at the back of the line, and none of my friends ever understood. Point blank, I would ask them if they felt that way or if it was just me, and they all said it was just me. \n\nLike, I haven't event played any games today because I just... idk what other words to say except procrastinated. I just lost focus and wasted time doing a lot of things while also doing nothing. I didn't even do it on purpose, I just lost track of time badly. I think I'll ask tomorrow to see if I can get another prescription after I go visit the mental health facility and hopefully receive a diagnosis. But yea, wow! I really didn't think those meds were helping me until after I stopped taking them. I don't know what to do to stay focused, my head just doesn't listen and I keep thinking of one thing or another, daydreaming often and just zoning out or losing track of time. My parents think I'm using this as an excuse, some people think I'm looking for attention. I don't like this 😅 this is a daily struggle. I don't want to feel like I need to work overtime twice as hard just to catch up to the back of the line. I just want to be in control and think and concentrate when I want to, but I can't. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can stay focused for an extreme duration more than others, and other times I have a hard time following a list of instructions or directions. When I've been told that I'm lazy, irresponsible, need discipline, that I'm doing this for attention, it makes me feel like a broken failure.",

I can't seem to get both on the same mg (Elvanse/Vyvanse/lisdexamphetamine).\n\nHigher for me gets me a quieter mind (no racing heart), but I get slow in making decisions. Lower mg gives me long study sessions, but can go on for hours (10+) and my heart races like crazy.\n\nWhat are the meds meant to do anyway? How do we know when they are working right?",
