The prototypical meal prep is essentially batch-cooking 4-5 lunches on a Sunday to be eaten throughout the work or school week, but it can go all the way from washing and pre-chopping vegetables, on up to cooking and freezing an entire month's worth of meals or more for the whole family. Meal prepping helps reduce food waste from perishable ingredients going unused, it helps save money, and it frees up your time throughout the week.\n\nNot sure where to start? Pick your most inconvenient meal and make a week of portions for it. Get used to the time investment needed to cook just that one meal for a whole week before adding more meals.\n\n* Lunch: Most people meal prep grab-and-go lunches to take to work or school, so that they don't have to cobble together a meal the night before when they're probably tired or the morning of when they're trying to rush out the door, and it helps save money not buying fattening takeout.\n* Breakfast: Who really wants to be cooking first thing in the morning when you gotta make it to work\/class on time? Meal prepping breakfast can also be an opportunity to make breakfasts to eat on the go, or once you're at work.\n* Dinner: Too tired to cook after being away at work\/school all day? Pre-cook dinner so that all you have to do is reheat the food and eat.\n* Snacks: Eating healthy snacks is much easier if those snacks are already washed and cut and ready to eat, or at least portioned so you don't down the whole bag. It'll also keep you away from the vending machine.\n* Prepwork: Some people \"meal prep\" by performing prepwork to make later cooking efforts easier. For instance, they pre-chop vegetables so they're ready to cook or eat raw later; put together slow cooker meals in gallon freezer bags out of raw meat, chopped vegetables, seasonings, and whatever else that can just be tipped into a slow cooker on demand; make and freeze casseroles that just need to be baked; cook large pots of stock to be frozen; or freeze fruit and vegetables in smoothie packets.\n\n----\n\n**HOW DO I GET STARTED?**\n\n* A quick and dirty tip for putting together balanced meals is to simply mix and match, in descending order of quantity, a vegetable, protein, and starch. Corn and potatoes are technically vegetables, yes, but nutritionally, they have more in common with starches and carbs like rice or pasta. Broccoli, chicken, and whole grain pasta. Asparagus, pork, and rice. Kale, beans, and quinoa. Bell peppers, eggs, and potatoes. Raw vegetables with dip, lunch meat, and crackers. Play around with it a bit.\n* Conservatively, cooked food will keep in the fridge for at least three days after the day of cooking. If you cook on Sunday, food meant to be eaten through Wednesday will be fine in the fridge, but food for Thursday and beyond should be either prepared and cooked after Sunday, or stored in the freezer. This \"three day rule\" is a starting point that comes from the [USDA](https:\/\/www.fsis.usda.gov\/food-safety\/safe-food-handling-and-preparation\/food-safety-basics\/leftovers-and-food-safety#_Store) and is a deliberately conservative guideline intended to be safe for immunocompromised folks, young children, the elderly, and the like. If you believe your food keeps in the fridge for longer than three days, you are welcome to do as you wish, but you do so at your own risk. Personally, I've been eating five, six, seven, even eight and nine day old refrigerated home-cooked leftovers and have never gotten sick, even \"risky\" stuff like seafood and rice.\n* If you're just starting out and aren't sure yet if meal prepping is for you, store your food in whatever containers you already have, so long as they have lids that seal relatively airtight. You can use leftover takeout containers or upcycle commercial food packaging, such as Cool Whip containers. If you don't have any containers at all, many brick-and-mortar grocery stores in addition to Amazon now sell inexpensive plastic \"meal prep containers\" with around 2-4 cup capacities that are designed to fit a single meal. Yes, plastic isn't ideal, but it's lightweight, cheaper than glass or metal, and won't shatter into dangerous shards, making it safer for children. Current research has found that simply storing food in plastic is perfectly safe; it's just reheating food in plastic that can pose a risk, and that's easily remedied by scooping your food into a bowl or plate and microwaving it there.\n* If you're interested in bulk-preparing full meals, go for recipes that are easy to scale up. A simple saute of meat and vegetables cooked in a skillet might be a perfectly good and quick meal for one or two, but it's hard to scale that up into a whole week's worth of food because most people's frying pans just can't fit that much food at once, leading to you babysitting a pan for possibly multiple hours as you cook each portion. A good place to start is recipes aimed at busy families, because those are often relatively quick and make 4-6 portions. Some recipe types to look for that can be good time-savers include:\n * Casseroles. There's a reason why they're so popular with families, because a typical casserole will have 6-8 portions, include meat, vegetables, and a carb, and most are cooked in the oven, so you don't have to constantly stir or babysit it and can go do other things. A lifesaver for a busy family with kids, and great for meal preppers. Casseroles are also an easy way to use up leftover meat and vegetables.\n * One-pot meals. You cook everything in a single big stockpot, which reduces cleanup and is great for people stuck with only one stove burner, and most one-pot meals will make at least four portions and will include protein, vegetables, and carbs all in one dish. A true one-pot meal will have you cook everything together at roughly the same time, but even a faux one-pot meal where you cook the protein and remove it and cook the vegetables and remove them and so on can be very convenient. Most soups are also one-pot meals, and can be very hearty with lots of meat and vegetables.\n * Sheet pan meals. Most standard US ovens can fit a 19\"x13\" sheet pan, which will fit a lot of food, as much as two pounds of vegetables. The basic crux of a sheet pan meal is that you arrange a bunch of vegetables and chopped up pieces of meat on a sheet pan with seasonings and a little oil, allowing plenty of space so the food can properly roast and get a bit charred instead of steaming, then oven-roast them all together. Add the vegetables that take the longest to cook to the pan first, and add other vegetables and meat that take less time later on.\n * Slow cooker meals. Most slow cookers come in large capacities, which means they can make a lot of food. Low and slow is how many cheap cuts of meat need to be cooked, which will also help you save money. And very little can beat the convenience of being able to dump a bunch of meat, vegetables, broth, and seasonings in the slow cooker, turn it on, and come back 8-12 hours later to enough food to feed you for a week.\n* Not everybody has the same levels of tolerance for what foods they'll consider \"good\" for meal prep, whether refrigerated for as long as 4-5 days after preparation, or portioned and frozen. While there are some foods that a lot of us might be able to agree do and don't freeze or hold up well as leftovers (frozen leafy greens, leftover sushi or carbonara, etc.), most of the rest is down to personal preference, and in the case of freezing, even \"ruined\" foods are just unappetizing, not unsafe. There are lots of foods I'll tolerate as long as the flavor can be perked up with some salt+pepper after reheating and the texture isn't too tough to eat or just complete oatmeal-like mush. Meal prepping does require at least some level of understanding that the food is not going to taste quite as good as when it was fresh. If you're not really much of a leftovers person and\/or have a tendency to be sensitive to changes in texture or flavor, be prepared to do some testing with small amounts of your food(s) and recipe(s) of choice, or even to just stick to prepping ingredients for later cooking.\n* There are some legitimate situations when meal prep, or at least the traditional \"full meal\" type, might not be the best option. If you genuinely enjoy cooking every day, like you use it to help you unwind, then you might not want to meal prep. One thing that a lot of people do for work lunches is that they will cook two portions of some dish for dinner, then eat one and pack up the other one for the next day's lunch; if you're perfectly satisfied doing that, then meal prepping might not be necessary. If your job or school provides meals with options that work with your tastes, diet\/health goals, and budget, it might be more cost-effective to just eat what's provided for you.\n* Try not to meal prep with any primary ingredient, appliance, or major cooking technique that you're not familiar with. If you make a mistake or simply find out that you don't even like the food or how you prepared it, you don't want there to be a whole week or more of that food lying around to choke down.\n* Remember that meal prepping doesn't mean you can never eat fresh food again, or go out to eat. A lot of meal preppers have a single designated day per week for getting takeout, or they cook fresh food on days off.\n\n----\n\n**ASSORTED TRICKS**\n\n* You can actually cook crispy fried foods and pack them in a lunch, and still have them be crispy the next day- cook the food to your preferred level of doneness, then once it's ready to eat, place the food on a plate or rack and cool it uncovered in the refrigerator, so that steam can escape and not make the food soggy. Once it's completely cold, then you can place it into a container, even alongside \"wet\" foods as long as the fried food isn't directly sitting in moisture. I've done this with stuff like frozen chicken fingers and it was absolute magic to bite into a perfectly crispy and juicy (albeit cold) chicken finger the next day.\n* You can meal prep seafood in bowl meals and even eat it warm without getting flack from those around you by removing the seafood, reheating everything else, and then breaking up and stirring the seafood into the hot food, so it warms through with radiant heat. This tactic also works for steak or other red meat that you want to keep below well-done, provided that you slice the steak into relatively small and\/or thin pieces that will warm through quickly. You can also do the same for any meal that you want to have both warm and cold components, such as a warm bowl meal topped with fresh crunchy vegetables. I like to place the \"no-reheat\" component(s) in a small plastic-wrapped packet, but you could also use separate containers.\n* If you're having trouble figuring out what to make for breakfast, or don't like or can't eat traditional western\/American breakfast foods, remember that the whole concept of \"breakfast food\" is literally a social construct. Many non-Western cultures don't even have a concept of food that is only eaten for breakfast; they just eat whatever will get them going for the day. There is nothing stopping you from eating something like a salad or soup or last night's dinner leftovers for breakfast as long as it fits your macros and goals.\n* If you're making freezer meals in preparation for a coming baby, one tip I've heard from many parents is that they went for foods that can be eaten one-handed while doing other things, like holding the baby or doing housework. Think burritos, wraps, things in the \"filled dumpling\" family (hand pies, potstickers, empanadas, bao buns, pierogies, etc.), finger foods, that sort of thing.\n* Having trouble with chicken drying out during reheating, or with \"warmed over\" flavor? Try these ideas:\n * Rule Zero is to not overcook the chicken, because food will cook a little during reheating, taking meat that was only a little overcooked when it was fresh to way overcooked. Buy a meat thermometer if you don't have one already and remove the chicken from the heat as soon as the thickest part hits 165 F\/74 C. Some even remove chicken from heat when it's a few degrees *below* 165, because the meat will continue cooking from its own residual heat as it rests.\n * Give the chicken a stronger flavor. Try marinating it before cooking, or dousing it in a sauce, or cooking with it in soups, stews, or one-pot meals.\n * If you're experiencing this problem with chicken breasts, try using boneless skinless thighs instead, which have a lot of dark meat. Dark meat has a stronger flavor than white meat breasts that can help overrule \"warmed over\" flavor, and a higher fat content that helps prevent it from drying out or getting tough as easily if it does wind up going past 165 F.\n * Try alternative heating methods. Instead of, say, microwaving for 90 seconds at 100% power, try 2 minutes at 60 or 70% power. If you have access to it, try a toaster oven, air fryer, or a pan on the stove with a little oil. Or if you're willing to eat the chicken in bite-sized pieces or smaller as part of a bowl meal or similar, remove the chicken from your dish, reheat everything else until it's hot, then stir the cold pieces of chicken into the hot food and let it warm through via radiant heat.\n * Some have only had success buying organic or higher-quality chicken, but this can be cost-prohibitive.\n * If all else fails, you could always try sticking to just eating your meal prepped chicken in cold dishes only, such as salads, wraps, or bowl meals.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1663989541.0},{"title":"Simple- I had brown rice leftover so I mixed it with shredded cheese and microwaved it.

First, I'd like to thank everyone for the wonderful tips on what to cook for my post-surgery: it was a success and I'm currently recovered and all nice. All the recipes ideas were wonderful, and while I couldn't do some due to cost, nonetheless, thank you very much.\n\nNow, as the title says, we have a new horizontal freezer with 143l of capacity. We got it for cheap from a friend, and at first I was excited on all we could do with the help from the internet, but I got stuck on some problems and I would love for this community to give me some light.\n\nThe thing is, most of the frozen recipes are either for pasta and carbs that I do want to avoid a bit, or they ask for you to leave them in a slow cooker all day. Fellas, I live in the sunny, warm and not slow cooker friendly Brazil. A good slow cooker here is the price of my kidney and two toes.\n\nI also work all day in-office, so my availability for prepping and cooking is during the weekend, or at max for one hour during nighttime.\n\nSo I gave up on the helpless websites and daydreams, and am asking my favorite people, you guys. I understood that I'll have to cook and keep any to-go meals in the fridge during the week, but my question is: what are your tactics to better utilize such a big freezer?\n\nFor extra context, I can get plenty of tropical fruits and veggies, since we live near the train that takes us to a massive wholesale area where we can get them for extra cheap and with plenty of variety, and my grandmother said she's willing to do weekly trips for me if necessary. Meat and poultry is more expensive lately, but I'm willing to learn how to break apart chickens or whole meat pieces so I can save money. I really just need a north for what can be truly useful.

Dice up half of the white onion and saut\u00e9 it in a large pot over medium low with a bit of salt, pepper, and olive oil (if you\u2019re using it)\n2. Once the onion starts to become translucent, add the garlic (if using) until it becomes fragrant \n3. Add in half of the small can of tomato paste. Add water to the can and pour that in as well. Stir until the paste becomes more of a sauce\n4. Turn up the heat to medium and add in the chicken thighs, placing them skin side first in the pot (season with salt and pepper). Stir occasionally so the chicken doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan. Flip the chicken after ~7 minutes and cook the other side for another ~8 minutes\n5. While the chicken is cooking, get a kettle of water boiling. Once the chicken has cooked for 15 minutes total, add the boiling water and let simmer for about 45 minutes (stirring occasionally, remember to keep seasoning with salt and pepper throughout)\n6. When there\u2019s about 10 minutes left on your timer, remove the skin from the chicken and return it to the boiling pan. \n7. Once the 45 minutes are up, add in the orzo, season with salt and pepper, and stir constantly for 10 minutes (or until the orzo soaks up all the liquid, add more water if needed)\n8. Season once more and add in the red pepper flakes if you like\n\nNow your manestra is ready to serve! I like to eat it with some crusty bread on the side.

Most days I eat one meal per day; sometimes, one meal every two days or even three days.\n\nWhat I eat is super simple--mainly  four things: meat (mostly pork), vegetables (cabbage\/broccoli), fruits  (apples\/oranges), and peanuts. \n\nIf  there is a contest on spending the least amount of touch time cooking, I  should win handily. Here is what I do. For pork, I get the pork  shoulder, which is the fattest (I like fatty meat) and also usually the  cheapest. I simply open the package, place two of these in a roasting  pan. Stick the pan in the oven, turn to 225 degrees before bed. The next  day, I just collect the perfectly roasted pork into containers. This is  enough to last me a month. Total touch time is \\~20 minutes including cleaning, which amortizes to <1 minute\/day. For the actual meal, I  simply get a chunk of the roast pork into a big bowl, pile on chopped  cabbage\/broccoli. Stick this into the microwave and cook for 25 minutes.  Touch time is 3-4 minutes max. The other stuff I eat needs no prep.  Therefore, the total touch time adds up to <5 minutes\/day. I  challenge anyone to beat that.\n\nLast year, for my family of four, we spent <6K on food, or just a hair over 100 bucks a week. I'm the family shopper and only buy fresh stuff.  I don't get when people say processed food is cheaper. Junk food is even more expensive. The rest of the family don't eat like me, but they are certainly well taken care of.","upvote_ratio":0.39,"created_utc":1677850974.0},{"title":"Why do we like spicy food items?","author":"Any_Client_5393","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/11g1e1r\/why_do_we_like_spicy_food_items\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1677759592.0},{"title":"What's The Difference Between A Soup And A Stew ?","author":"Malixshak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/11f4ekc\/whats_the_difference_between_a_soup_and_a_stew\/","text":"Kind of confusing to call something a Soup and someone says Nah, that's  a stew. \n  What is a soup and how is it different from a stew?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677678998.0},{"title":"Kicking my Nespresso habit!

I also get free ingredients from the food bank. \n\n1. **Grits and overnight oats**\n\n\\- I made grits with 50% coarse cornmeal 50% steal cut oats. Season and top with shredded cheese or pickled onion. The cooked grit store for a week in the fridge (with no toppings).\n\n\\- Overnight oats (old fashion oats, chia seeds, coconut milk or cream, water, sugar, whatever else I had in the pantry that might taste good). Coconut milk is non-negotiable, beside that I like the taste, it is pretty cheap, and it makes me feel super full.\n\n2. **Rice + Saucy savory protein dish** (like how we ate in our SEAsian household when I was growing up)\n\n\\- Rice is just cooked white rice, nothing fancy.\n\n\\- It's important that the savory dish is a bit salty (aka you probably shouldn't eat it by itself, but not too salty because sodium), so you will eat more rice in order to balance it out = stretching out the protein dish. It also should be saucy because the sauce will be tasty with rice. I find that even when I run out of the protein, the rice is still delicious with the sauce and I can just fry an egg to eat with this rice+sauce thing. \n\n\\- protein dish can be beans. Pinto bean is amazing and easy to make. When I eat just beans and rice I top it with pickled onions.\n\n\\- Some examples of  protein dishes I make often: Japanese curry, braised meat\/tofu, stew. There's a cooking technique called Kho, which is simple and is used to make salty dishes, is you can't eat fish sauce, use soy sauce. This type of dish is delicious and have you eat more rice -> make you feel full. \n\n[**https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kho\\_(cooking\\_technique)**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kho_(cooking_technique))\n\n3. **Rice + seasoning**\n\n\\- When there's nothing in the pantry or I'm busy or lazy. I just eat rice with furikake or soy sauce and a fried egg. \n\n\\- when there's no egg, I make congee and eat it with fermented bean curd (chinese tofu cheese). Congee only last a few days in the fridge so I make a lot but eat them fast.\n\n4**. Snacks**\n\n\\- banana or apples and peanut butter\n\n\\- corn cheese (1 can of corn + onion + seasoning + mayo + cheese. If there's no cheese, no cheese it is)\n\n\\- instant ramen or a cheap granola bar\n\n\\- pineapple (a pineapple can be $1.5 on sale). Get it, learn how to cut them (I do the spiral cut method), soak it in salt water for 20 minutes to get rid of the acid, drain it well, Put it in containers and they stores in the fridge for 1 - 1.5 week.\n\n\\- Milk tea (2 black tea bags, boiling hot water for 3 minutes, take out the bags, 1 spoon of creamer, 1 spoon of condensed milk). A surprisingly good way to curb my adhd and stress eating because I just take a sip of this to prevent me from thinking about food in between meals. The sweetness make it seems like a snack.\n\n\\- Oat chocolate chips cookies (this is a splurge I allow myself to have, I prep the dough and freeze them, oat is cheap and bulk up the cookie dough a lot so it seems cheaper to me, preppykitchen's recipe only requires 1 stick of butter and 1 egg to make 24 cookies).","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677170767.0},{"title":"I need some advice and I was directed to this sub so hopefully this is the right place to ask for the advice.","author":"Efe-Rose","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/11akfly\/i_need_some_advice_and_i_was_directed_to_this_sub\/","text":"I\u2019m Looking for meals that can be completely prepared and cooked on the stovetop.

I've since come around to putting a little finnesse into canned beans and it makes a huge difference.  First things first; you should cook your canned beans, yes it requires a pot and some time but it's a lot quicker and easier than dry beans and like dry beans it's still a pretty hands off process.   Second, use some of the liquid from the can when simmering.  I always drained and rinsed my beans because the liquid weirded me out but, it's really just salty water with some starches, I usually still get rid of some of it but I don't completely rinse, that residual bean slurry is good for seasoning and simmering.  Third, add seasoning to your beans, salt and pepper at least (careful with the salt, taste while simmering and add more if necessary, some canned beans can be pretty salty already), I also like to use granulated or powdered garlic, onion, cumin, chili powder, paprika, etc, or any combinatination of those or whatever you like.\n\nTL;DR - the right spice mix, and a solid 20-30 minutes of simmering can make canned beans much, much more pleasant, and at about $1 or less in most grocery stores near me, you can make a solid base for burritos, tacos, quesadillas, etc that will last all week for just a few bucks.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677025467.0},{"title":"Hey guys.

I add a few pantry spices, but you can mix and match them depending on what you have on hand.\n* if you don't want to make your own broth, use a store-bought rotisserie chicken and store-bought broth and skip the first part of the recipe! you'll save time, and it'll still be delicious :-)\n* if you don't have parsley or lemon, it's fine to omit it...just adds a nice little brightness at the end, but the soup is still good without it!\n* you can also use the veggie trimmings from the soup (carrot tops, root-end of the celery stalk, and celery tops, etc) in the broth instead of using whole veg if you want to conserve.\n\nServings: 8\u201310\n\n**Chicken broth:**\n\n* 4-pound\u00a0chicken, giblets reserved for another use\n* 1\u00a0yellow onion, scrubbed and quartered (peels left on, if you like)\n* 3 carrots, scrubbed and cut into thirds\n* 1\u00a0head of garlic, halved crosswise\n* 4\u00a0ribs of celery, rinsed and cut into thirds\n* 12\u00a0cups\u00a0water, plus more if needed\n* Salt\n\n**Chicken barley soup:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 3 ribs celery with leaves, trimmed and diced; leaves minced\n* 4 carrots, peeled, trimmed, and sliced into rounds\n* 2 tablespoons butter, optional\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* Crushed red pepper, to taste\n* 1 cup pearled barley, rinsed\n* 8\u20139 cups chicken broth (from the recipe above), plus 2\u20133 cups water if needed\n* 1\/3 cup loosely packed parsley, minced; a pinch reserved for garnish\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Prepare the chicken and broth:**\n\n1. Place the chicken in a large pot and add the onion, carrots, garlic, and celery. Season with 1\u20132 teaspoons salt. Don\u2019t go overboard with salting; it will cook down, and you can always add more later. Add a few cracks of black pepper. Bring to a boil and then cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n2. Carefully remove the chicken from the pot using tongs. Transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool.\n3. Return the broth to a rapid simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes to reduce the broth further. It will be a dark golden brown.\n4. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids. You should be left with 8\u20139 cups of broth.\n5. Pick the chicken from the bones and shred the meat with your fingers. Transfer the shredded meat to the bowl of strained broth to keep it moist. Reserve the carcass for stock if you like.\n\n**Prepare the soup:**\n\n1. Wipe out the pot used to make the broth. You may wish to give it a quick rinse in the sink if you like.\n2. Place it on a burner over medium-high heat. Add the neutral oil, and once hot, add the onions, celery with minced leaves, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper.

I was hesitating so much on getting the apple juice I usually use for my smoothies. I stood in the aisle for 10 minutes until it hit me that apple sauce is basically the bouillon to make juice (close enough). This make me realized that I can probably also uses fruit preserves + water too to make other types of flavored liquid (same idea as the korean citron tea). \nDang what other things am I missing out on.\n\n\n\nEdit: hii,  sorry I didn't know I would get this much attention from this post. Thank you for the engagement and the discussion. I appreciate it. I want to clarify somethings and answer some common questions, concerns.\n\nI bought treetop apple sauce in the smaller jar which was around 1.4lbs (5 servings) for around $2.5\nApples in that grocery store is around $1 for an apple. I guess I can buy a bag instead of individual apples to get a better deal but a bag of apple would cost at least $4.99 for 3lb. \nA gallon of apple juice is around $4.50\nAt the grocery store, I was not trying to pick a best deal for my money, I was just trying to get what I can, which is ultimately the $2.50 option to keep the grocery bill under $10.\n\n\n\"Why make smoothie when you're dirt poor?\" \n- I meal prep smoothies and have leftover from last month. In there it has: bananas I got for free from work or from my roommate, some zucchini that I got from the food bank that I didn't eat in time and they almost gone bad, some cheap on sale strawberries (they are pretty flavorless) I bought for myself last month because just zucchini and banana smoothie doesn't sound that good (imo). I used apple juice because I got that from the food bank also.  Applejuice also helps a lot with flavor when the smoothie is just scavenged food scraps. So when the juice ran out, suddenly I was left with these frozen fruits veggies and I just wanted to get some liquid to go through the rest of those smoothie cups. \n\n\"Why not use water?\"\nIdk I was scared it would taste bad because I have never try it. If it taste bad, I would have to suffer and be miserable and reminded of my situation. Or I would have to throw it away and waste my precious food. Applesauce sounds a tiny bit better to me at that moment. Plus I can use the applesauce to replace eggs in baking (please don't ask why are you baking when you don't have money).\n\nSome people were talking about calories but I honestly don't care about calories. I care the most about flavor. I cry when I eat something bad but still have to finish it anyway because I can't afford to waste it. So I just want things to taste good.\n\n\"Find a food bank! .... Here's some support!\" Thank you so much you are so sweet! Once a month I can get some food from a local food bank, and I get some food from my work also. I just have a very tight budget for grocery which is $20 a month. This month it's just bad because I needed to replace some hygiene stuffs, plus my laptop broke and I needed money to fix it.\n\nNobody asked this but \"why do you have a blender?\" I got it for free :D!!","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676853316.0},{"title":"Do dry goods kept dry meaningfully expire?","author":"Interesting-Form-508","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/117kpo1\/do_dry_goods_kept_dry_meaningfully_expire\/","text":"Like, rice\/flour\/pasta\/dried beans.

It was so good, I ate three servings... whoops!\n\nThe version below has a few modifications from the original, but is very very close. It makes a TON of food, is ready in about 30-40 minutes, and oh-so comforting and nutritious. I ended up eating all of the leafy greens and plan to cook more when I reheat the leftovers, of which there are many.\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* Olive oil\n* 2-3 leeks, white and light green parts only\n* 3 garlic cloves, minced\n* 3\/4C rice, rinsed\n* 1.5 tsp cumin\n* 1\/2 tsp. allspice *(I did not have allspice so I seasoned with a mix of a few shakes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove)*\n* 1\/4 tsp. cayenne *(optional, I forgot to add this and it was still delicious)*\n* 1C lentils (brown or green)\n* 4 1\/4C water\n* 1 bay leaf\n* 1 cinnamon stick *(optional, I didn't have one and... it was still delicious)*\n* 4C chopped leafy greens *(spinach, chard, kale, etc.)*\n* Salt\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n1. Add lentils to a bowl and add warm water to cover by 1 inch; set aside.\n2. Slice the leeks lengthwise and rinse out any grit. Slice crosswise.\n3. Heat 1\/4C olive oil in a large dutch oven or pot over medium\/medium-high. Once hot, add leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy (5-10 mins).\n4. Remove half of the leeks from the pot and sprinkle with some salt.\n5. Add the garlic to the remaining leeks and oil in the post, cook briefly until fragrant, then add rice and spices and saute for 30 seconds.\n6. Drain lentils, then stir into pot. Add water, 2 tsp. salt, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick (if using). Give it a good stir. Cover and simmer on low for \\~15 minutes.\n7. While it simmers, rinse the chopped greens. When 15 minutes are up, remove the lid and add the damp greens on top, cover again, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes.\n8. Turn off heat, let sit for 5 additional minutes. Sprinkle with crispy leeks, hot sauce (if you want), and eat.\n\nHope you enjoy.

The eggs I have in my home can go from 50g to 60g (I weighed a few of them). I don't want to weigh every single egg I eat everyday, so what would you guys do about that? Also there may be a case where I need, let's say, like 2.2 eggs for example, to meet my macro demands, but obviously I'm not goint to crack an extra egg and consume 1\/5 of it.

We're all picky to some degree, some worse than others. I don't buy pre-made food (apparently I'm an ingredient house). This is what I'm dealing with:\n\nMe: I prefer a more vegetarian diet. The only meat I'll eat is chicken or turkey. I try to eat fish, but I have to choke it down because I really don't like it. I'm pretty flexible with vegetables, beans, lentils, etc. I don't like egg based dishes (none of us are a fan of stuff like quiches). The kids and I hate swiss cheese. It leaves this awful aftertaste and I have no idea why (my half siblings all hate swiss too so maybe it's genetic?)\n\nHusband: He isn't too picky. The only things he doesn't like is onions (if they are cut small then that's fine), stuffed vegetables, green peppers, garbanzo beans (he's trying to like them).\n\nOldest child: She's like her dad and is flexible to most things. Chicken and turkey are the only meats she'll eat. She does love to try different foods from around the world. When she was a baby she would try anything and people would say \"You don't know how lucky you are to have such a good eater!\" I didn't get that until...\n\nMiddle child: Pickiest person in the universe. The whole \"Put it in front of them multiple times and eventually they'll eat it\" does not apply. When she was a baby she spit out mashed potatoes because she hated the texture. Still doesn't eat them (but she'll eat a jar of kalamata olives). She has ODD and sensory issues (we all have ADHD, but she's the only one with ODD). At least now she's old enough to just make herself a hotdog. The only things she'll eat are hotdogs, ham and cheese sandwiches, pasta with sauce, Impossible Burgers (I don't buy them anymore because my husband and I got sick of them) and pizza (homemade). The only vegetable she'll eat are cherry tomatoes. It's just ridiculous and while I offer her whatever I'm making, she refuses. I'm not looking to please her because it's impossible.\n\nYoungest child - He will copy the middle child sometimes, but he's pretty easy to get to try something. He loves drumsticks, but doesn't like thighs or breasts (unless it's chicken nuggets). I expect once he's older he won't be as picky.\n\nWhen it was just myself, my husband, and my oldest I had way more options to try random recipes, but the younger two make cooking a bit unenjoyable. I'll make pasta and sauce (I'll probably start getting ground turkey or chicken to make meatballs), burrito bowls, chicken legs, curries, roasted chicken (not often since a whole chicken is expensive), and black bean tacos. I used to make mac and cheese, but for some reason I started to hate it. I also used to make tuna casserole, but since coming to terms with the fact that I don't like fish I don't make it anymore. Enchiladas are a no-go because my oldest doesn't like them anymore which leaves eating them to my husband and me which results in waste. My oldest will make black bean burritos and my husband makes homemade chicken nuggets (we make enough to freeze) and pizza. Rest of the week I cook and I am so uninspired that it's kind of depressing. The Safeway app now has \"meal plans,\" but when I did the math it's not exactly that cheap and anything that's interesting has ingredients I will only use for that recipe. Any cheap recipes that at least myself, husband, and oldest will eat is much appreciated. I'm a little embarrassed at what a picky family we are, now that I typed it up.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1676306925.0},{"title":"High protein meals","author":"Betty_boo1232","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/110y8jl\/high_protein_meals\/","text":"Looking for yummy high protein meals \nThank you","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676259049.0},{"title":"Anyone got a some good recipes for overnight oats?","author":"Youllneverknow94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/110gh03\/anyone_got_a_some_good_recipes_for_overnight_oats\/","text":"I\u2019m gonna go pick some stuff to make overnight oats.

But don\u2019t let the stigma fool you - they are as healthy & filling as a regular chicken, for a fraction of the cost!\n\nWhile you won\u2019t typically find a stewing hen at a supermarket, they are found with a little bit of effort. Asian or Hispanic markets will typically have them, along with restaurant wholesalers & suppliers. How cheap are they? A single stew hen goes for $2.49 at my local Mexican market. Not per pound - the whole chicken! If you are blessed with a large freezer, I\u2019ve seen them go for $12 for a dozen.\n\nHow to prepare: as the name suggests, stew hens are best for\u2026 stewing. Really, any application when they can be slow cooked in liquid, since they will dry out & toughen otherwise. Braises, soups, stews, etc. A helpful tip I learned is treat it less like a chicken and more along the lines of a stewing beef (like chuck roast or top round).        \n\nLong story short, if you\u2019re looking for a cheap & easy source of protein, check out Stewing Hens.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675978833.0},{"title":"Suggestions requested: reference guide for basic ingredients","author":"panic_cat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/10ybtca\/suggestions_requested_reference_guide_for_basic\/","text":"Hi all - I'm looking for a reference guide\/cookbook that focuses on individual ingredients (as opposed to full recipes).

Please stop buying those things! You will get a higher quality, less expensive product with this alternative:\n\n* 1 T chili powder\n* 1\/2 t salt\n\nMany people don't realize that commercial chili powder is a blend of chili pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and other seasonings. The ingredients can vary widely across brands so find one that you like.\n\nFirst let's check my claim that it is cheaper. I went to Walmart online grocery and selected a mid-priced products for comparison. I found McCormick Dark Chili Powder (7.5 oz \/ 212g) for $4.77. Some site online told me a tablespoon of chili powder weighs about 6g so that's about 35 T per bottle or $0.14 per tablespoon. Salt is pretty cheap, but to make certain I found a container of Morton's on Walmart.com for $1.26 (26oz \/ 737g.) A half teaspoon weighs about 2.8g so after all the math that comes out to about one half of a penny for the salt. Let's be generous and say my taco seasoning replacement costs 15 cents. One the same site, the Old El Paso taco seasoning packet costs $0.88 or over 5 times as much.\n\nBuying chili powder and salt separately is also more versatile. You don't have to follow the 1T chili powder to 1\/2 t salt if you like whatever you are making to be more or less spicy or salty. (That's a feature a packet won't give you.) Plus, you can use only as much as you need and put the cap back on the bottle and use it for stuff later. (I love chili powder. It is delicious in so many foods.)\n\nThe one thing missing is the terrible instructions on the back of the packet that tell you to boil the meat. (A crime against all that is good in the world.) So here are my better ones for making taco meat:\n\nGet a frying pan HOT over medium-high heat and throw in one pound of ground beef. Let it sit until it gets a nice brown crust on the bottom, then flip it over and do the same to the other side. (No decent person prefers that gray, flavorless, boiled beef from the packet.) Now lower the heat to medium-low and break up the beef with a wooden spoon to finish cooking. This would be the time I would recommend adding a small, minced onion. (Onion powder is not a cheaper or healthier alternative to real onion!) You could even add a minced clove of garlic here to really elevate the flavor. Once you don't see any red in the meat, reduce the heat to the lowest setting (to keep warm) and sprinkle in the tablespoon of chili powder and the 1\/2 teaspoon of salt and stir it in thoroughly. You could also add some black pepper now, if that is your thing.\n\nThis is even easier than the whole boiling nonsense. If you ever become less poor and want to bump it up a notch I would highly encourage the purchase of a spice grinder to make your own chili seasoning mix. It's a whole 'nother lever of amazing.","upvote_ratio":0.51,"created_utc":1675448758.0},{"title":"EASY, cheap, & healthy","author":"thetaleofc7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/10rvp4l\/easy_cheap_healthy\/","text":"EDIT: thanks so much everyone!

Perfect as soup or served with rice or crispy chickpeas","author":"BushyEyes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/10q4ujk\/cauliflower_curry_pur\u00e9e_perfect_as_soup_or_served\/","text":"**PIC:** [**https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GdCuuc0.jpg**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GdCuuc0.jpg)\n\n**Recipe here originally:** [**Cauliflower Curry Pur\u00e9e**](https:\/\/exploringvegan.com\/cauliflower-curry-puree\/)\n\nI made cauliflower curry yesterday and overcooked my cauliflower...if you've ever made this mistake and you have an immersion blender, blitz it into a pur\u00e9e! If you don't have an immersion blender, you can still enjoy it as a chunky soup; just add a little extra water!\n\nThe curry pur\u00e9e is 5 ingredients (not including oil, salt, pepper, and water).\n\n**Serving suggestions:**\n\n1. You could easily eat it as a standalone soup. Maybe add a can of chickpeas to the soup as it simmers for extra protein.\n2. Serve it with basmati rice and steamed peas (that's what I did, and it was amazing!)\n3. Roast up some chickpeas spiced with more curry powder, and pile the crispy chickpeas on top.\n\nI included the recipe for the rice below. If serving with chickpeas or rice, just make them while the veggies simmer.\n\n**Here's how I made it:**\n\n**Cauliflower curry pur\u00e9e:**\n\n* 2 tablespoons neutral oil\n* 2 shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced\n* 1 medium head cauliflower (about 1 pound), trimmed and cut into florets\n* 1\u00bd tablespoons curry powder of choice, I used a hot Punjabi masala\n* 3 cups water, plus more if needed\n* 15- ounce can full-fat coconut milk\n* Salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste\n\n**Basmati rice (optional):**\n\n* 1 shallot or small yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 cup basmati rice\n* 1\u00be cups water\n* \u00bd cup frozen peas\n\n**For serving (optional):**\n\n* Lime wedges, cilantro, sliced Serrano or bird\u2019s eye chili peppers\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the vegetables:**\n\n1. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot (or onion) and potatoes and cook, often stirring, for 5 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the cauliflower florets and arrange them into an even layer. Sizzle in the oil for 4\u20135 minutes until they begin to char around the edges. Season with salt.\n3. Create a well in the middle of the pot and add another splash of oil if the pot is dry. Add the curry powder to the hot oil and let it bloom for 30\u201340 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables in the powder and season again with salt if needed. Add red pepper flakes if you like extra heat.\n\n**Simmer the vegetables:**\n\n1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until the cauliflower and potatoes are fork-tender. Stir the vegetables occasionally to ensure they haven't stuck. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Prepare the basmati rice (optional):**\n\n1. While the vegetables simmer, make the rice. First, rinse the rice thoroughly. Set aside.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3\u20134 minutes.\n3. Add the rice and season all over with salt. Stir for 1\u20132 minutes until it just begins to toast. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15\u201317 minutes.\n4. Turn off the heat. Remove the lid and quickly add the frozen peas (do not stir them into the rice). Cover and let the residual heat steam the peas for 5\u201310 minutes. Remove the cover and stir to combine. Taste and add salt, if needed.\n\n**Finish the pur\u00e9e:**\n\n1. Pour in the coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend until completely smooth and creamy. Add more water in \u00bc cup increments until desired consistency is reached. You may need up to 1 cup of additional water if serving as soup. If serving as a pur\u00e9e, you may not need water at all. Taste and season.\n\n## To serve:\n\n1. Spoon the pur\u00e9e into shallow bowls. Pile the rice on top. Garnish with cilantro, lime, and sliced green chilies.

I've been making cabbage and sausage soup every day now for my breakfast. Probably this soup has its own variations but this is how I do it under 5 mins:\n\n1 quarter of cabbage\n\n1 smoked sausage (I use polish sausages they are great)\n\n1 tbs pepper paste (Chili oil can be ok too if you want it spicy)\n\n1 tbs tomato paste\n\nbutter\/margarine\/any oil\n\nHalf of the chicken gel stocks\/any chicken stock\n\n1- Chop your veggies and sausages!\n\n2- Put everything into heat except for the stock! Making sure cabbages and sausages are nicely coated with tomato & pepper paste. Do this for about a min in med heat (make sure your paste is not burning)\n\n3- Cover the mixture with boiling water or chicken stock.\n\n4- Let it boil for 2 minutes until the cabbages are looking soft. Add some salt\/spices you like. I use a Caribbean rub.\n\n5- At the very end you can add some cheese (totally optional, I use feta but it breaks down and doesn't look appetizing lmao but I love the taste & healthy protein)\n\nYou can alter this recipe to be easily vegan as well. I am sure tofu or vegan sausages would be okay. Just make sure to add some sort of protein that'd cook quickly. This soup is not a thick soup! However, if you wish to have a thicker soup I assume you could use your flour at the beginning or starch before adding the water but I never tried it! Or you could add some potatoes to make it starchier. If you can afford to get real sourdough bread, it'll feel more hearty. Sourdough bread is much healthier\/filling and lasts longer so in the long term, it is not more expensive.\n\nThe purpose of this soup is to make you feel warmed up, awake, and full. Savory breakfasts are superior in a way they can keep you full for longer than sweet options. Starting your day with something sweet most times leads to unstable blood spikes throughout the day, making you feel tired and increasing your likeliness of cravings.\n\nThis cabbage soup was an example, you can also have some chicken\/beef soup in the morning. They are also filling and warm in winter times!\n\nEdit: Made my instruction more clear and added a bit more detail now.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675076389.0},{"title":"What are some ways to make lasagna noodles cheap?","author":"Routine_Log8315","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EatCheapAndHealthy\/comments\/10pocbm\/what_are_some_ways_to_make_lasagna_noodles_cheap\/","text":"I\u2019ve got 2 boxes of lasagna noodles (they\u2019re gluten free, so can\u2019t do anything creative with them) and was planning on making lasagna since I already have ground beef, but the mozzarella and ricotta alone come to 12 (and that\u2019s thanks to a sale).

Half of that being mixing ingredients and prep. And that's just dinner. \n\nAlso I'm moving to a new place with much higher rent, and if I can cut costs in a way that I can sustain that's just a net positive. Usually in the past when I tried buying groceries and cooking, it ended up costing about the same. \n\nMy diet consists of a lot of high fat high protein meals. When I do cook it's mostly chicken, beef, fish, or eggs with sides of rice, pasta, etc. I do use a slow cooker for all my non-fish meat, and a rice cooker for my rice.

You can throw almost any veggie in there - celery, carrots, squash - and use kale or spinach, depending on what you have!\n\nYou could even make it in a crockpot...add everything except the kale and cream and cook 3\u20134 hours on high, or 7\u20138 hours on low.

Flip the chicken and add the onion, potatoes, garlic pepper, and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat and cook for 5 minutes.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Add the beans and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes.\n2. Remove chicken and shred with two forks. They can be big pieces, no need to be fussy about it! Taste and season once more.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Add the chicken back to the pot along with the kale and heavy cream. Simmer for 5 minutes until kale is wilted. Finish with lemon juice and parsley. Taste and season once more.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more parsley if you like.

When I first discovered this I thought the produce that was discounted was stuff that was \u2018about to go bad\u2019, or go \u2018out of date\u2019 (like they do in the meat section)\u2026 and there IS some of that, but often there is stuff that is somewhat \u2018imperfect\u2019 - for example, recently I got a bag with the equivalent of a half dozen huge portobello mushrooms caps for 50 cents.

Even with the stuff about to \u2018go bad\u2019\u2026 if you know how, and have the storage capacity, you can cut them up and freeze them if you can\u2019t use right away (I do this with peppers that are just starting to shrivel - chop them up and freeze them in bags for pasta sauce, chili, etc.).  I now stop by my local store 2-3 times a week just to see what they have.  The downside is that you never know what they might have available, but as long as you are flexible you can get some incredible deals!

I love fish, but since I didn't learn to eat fish until I was an adult, I'm lost at how to cook it. \n\nCod I like breaded, but that gets soggy for leftovers. Salmon reheats well and is easy to bake and frie on it's own, with hoisin, soy and garlic or lemon and pepper.... but what am I missing out on? What should I try? \n\nPlus: Is there a good way to cook one of those frozen blocks of random shredded white fish? Something that isn't fish casserole?","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674568545.0}]
