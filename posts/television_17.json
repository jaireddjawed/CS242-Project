The existence of cell phones has made these kinds of plots obsolete, or require writing in justifications like conveniently being in an area with no signal or everyone's phone running out of battery. Other common plots involved characters not having access to information that nowadays would be one google search away.\n\nBut new technologies have also created their own tropes that have become cemented in television. Now lots of plots revolve around characters having cell phones. For example, a character being freaked out that their love interest read their message but still hasn't answered back, or a character's embarrassing escapades being posted on social media for all to see.  What other tropes exist thanks to modern technology and what new ones do you expect in the future?",

I feel like everyone has different repertoires &amp; streaming services! \nidk maybe I’m wrong and this will be nothing! either way, I’ll start. \n\nOne of my favorite shows that I can continuously rewatch is:\n\nJane the Virgin. I love the character story lines, the romance, the friendships, the comedy, and the real life relatable shit. \n\n•The Good Place - Netflix - Kristen Bell plays the lead (enough right there) as a not so good person and dies and go to heaven.. she gets referred to as a woman named Eleanor (  a selfless humanitarian) .. will she tell someone the truth? 10/10 can’t rewatch it enough. Hilarious. \n\n• Younger - Hulu - About a 40 year old woman trying to reenter the work world (journalism) who gets convinced to fake her age for her job (current times fashion website) co-stars Hillary Duff! Loved it so much, so many different points of view, plot hooked me!!\n\n• Sex Lives of College Girls - HBO - avoided it for so long bc I thought it would be so cringey but I loved it so much. It’s a cute cringey and they focus on some great storylines/ topics that I, not In college, related to and really got attached to.\n\nHope this helped someone &amp; that this thread sticks around! Reply with your suggestions or reference show!",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nHope everyone’s doing well.\n\nI’ve always thought in order to best connect to a comedic performance, it probably needs at least a little bit of a dramatic tension in the background (or foreground) in order to make the comedy even funnier but also to create a more three-dimensional picture of the character and scene. If it’s just jokes, jokes, jokes, then I think it’s harder to connect and relate to the heart and soul of the character delivering them.\n\nThe Office has many examples of this but one is when in the season 4 episode “Money” Michael Scott is very tired, dejected and lacking focus and it’s just a very different Michael Scott and Steve Carell depicts this very well and the conversations seem even more natural and the episode as a whole has less hijinks than usual (aside from Mose Schrute, mainly) and I feel Steve had to carry it more on the dramatic acting side than usual and I felt for Michael and the predicament he and Dwight was in that episode, who, by the way, also shined in that episode.\n\nDr. Cox’s best friend Ben (played by Brendan Fraser) had a very gut-wrenching three episodes in Scrubs and in My Screw Up in particular was very moving and if that doesn’t make you tear up at least a little, you’re a heartless, soulless monster. “Where do you think we are?”\n\nWill’s father abandoning him again on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air I thought was another very good example of dramatic acting by Will and James, especially in that last scene of that episode. \"How come he don't want me, man?\" What a tearjerker, sitcom or not.\n\nWhat are your favorites?",
