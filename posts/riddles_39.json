Each pirate is assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  They are a democratic but cruel bunch, so in order to maximize each pirates share they vote on the execution of the living pirate with the highest number assigned to them. 50% of the vote in favour of ending this mad drama is sufficient for the game to be ended and the pirates to accept their respective share of the treasure. If a majority favours the execution the pirate dies and they continue to vote on the death of the next pirate in line.\nHow long will the pirates continue to execute their fellow crewmen?\n\nBecause it was omitted in the last pirate riddle I posted:\n1. all pirates are impeccable logicians\n2. A dead pirate won't get a share of the treasure, so they all would like to stay alive very much\n",

It starts by the person running through a deck of cards saying kind of explaining a pack of cards. He first says: they're 4 suits of cards diamond,hearts,clubs.....\nIn each suit they're 4 types of cards Queen,King,Ace.....\n\nYou're now asked to pick either Diamonds or hearts or clubs and spades.\n\nI picked spades, he then replied picked a type of card king queen ace...I picked jack. \n\nHe turns over the piece of paper to reveal 'Jack of spades' \n\nI'm pretty sure its just a low key mind game being played because you're wanting to say the card / suit he hasn't yet mentioned...How can i play it back to him or shake things up to throw him off!
