Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don't want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we're going to post a discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them. In addition, our friends at /r/bannedbooks would love for you to check out their sub and discuss banned books there as well.",

A number of times in book groups I’ve attended, someone has to attempted to annul another person’s valid criticism of the book because of their gender/race/sexual orientation/social status. “Your point is invalid because you’re not \\[victimised group from the book\\].”\n\nOf course it helps that characters are relatable and obviously it is difficult to understand oppression or persecution if you haven’t experienced it yourself, but in my opinion, even the most righteous and noble-intentioned of books can be complete drivel if they're written poorly. In fact, if the book is supposed to shine attention on an important subject, there should be even more emphasis on good research and strong writing to support the message.  \n\n\nAnyone else experience this? Has anyone ever said to you \"You just don't get it because you're not \\_\\_\\_\\_\"-? Have you been reluctant to give criticism of a book for fear of backlash? Do you think this attitude has gotten worse in recent times?",

Circe, who was neglected by her father and mother, left by the brother she loved, betrayed by the man she made and then punished for being herself. I cried many times reading it as I related to it so much, no matter what Circe did, she held no value in anyone's eyes. A handful of people saw her as what she was and a only one knew what she was capable of and what she has done.\n\nA nymph who could stop a goddess, a nymph who bested a creature older than the gods and Titans.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11swrri/in_ulysses_james_joyce_jokingly_names_pontius/",
        "text": "Here is what it returned when asked to write a short essay on the topic:\n\nPontius Pilate was a prominent figure in ancient history, serving as the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. While Pilate is often remembered for his role in the trial and execution of Jesus of Nazareth, his impact on the development and spread of Roman law cannot be ignored. In many ways, Pontius Pilate can be seen as the apostle of the Roman law, just as Peter was the apostle of Christianity.\n\nLike Peter, Pilate was a pivotal figure in the spread of his ideology. Peter traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, preaching the teachings of Jesus and establishing new Christian communities. Similarly, Pilate's administration of Judea was marked by the implementation of Roman law, a legal system that was to become the foundation of Western jurisprudence.\n\nUnder Pilate's leadership, Judea saw a significant expansion of Roman law. He was known for his strict enforcement of Roman law and his willingness to impose harsh punishments on those who violated it. Pilate's administration saw the implementation of numerous legal reforms, including the establishment of courts and the codification of laws.\n\nOne of Pilate's most significant contributions to Roman law was his role in the development of the concept of jus civile, or civil law. This legal system, which focused on the rights and duties of Roman citizens, was to become the foundation of modern civil law. Pilate was also instrumental in the development of jus gentium, or the law of nations, which dealt with issues of international law and trade.\n\nLike Peter, Pilate faced significant opposition to his ideology. The Jewish population of Judea, in particular, was resistant to the imposition of Roman law, which they saw as a threat to their religious and cultural identity. Similarly, early Christians faced persecution from the Roman authorities, who viewed their beliefs as a threat to the stability of the empire.\n\nDespite these challenges, both Peter and Pilate persevered in their efforts to spread their respective ideologies. Peter's preaching and evangelism helped establish Christianity as a major world religion, while Pilate's strict enforcement of Roman law helped establish it as the foundation of modern legal systems.\n\nIn conclusion, Pontius Pilate can be seen as the apostle of the Roman law, just as Peter was the apostle of Christianity. Both men were instrumental in the development and spread of their respective ideologies, facing significant opposition and persecution along the way. While their impact on the world may have been vastly different, their legacies continue to shape our understanding of law and religion today.",

        "text": "So I've been on a big classic binge over the past several months and it's been great. I've even found some new favorite books (Jane Eyre, Frankenstein, Emma). But nothing compares to the life-chaning experience of reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez's masterpiece. It's a melancholy yet beautiful family saga with characters and passages that I think about at least once a day. Nothing I have ever read has transported me into the emotional state that this flawless work of art did.\n\nOne of the novel's motifs that really spoke to me was when characters facing death would mentally experience their whole life and begin to appreciate, in a bittersweet way, all the best of worst, all the meaningful and meaningless, aspects of life. The writing was of course stunning and I can't even begin to imagine how beautiful it is in its original Spanish. I could list dozens and dozens of passages but this might be my personal favorite because it comes from my favorite chararcter, Fernanda:\n\n&gt;The first time that she put it on she could not help a knot from forming in her heart and her eyes filling with tears because at that moment she smelled once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the officer who came to get her at her house and make her a queen, and her soul brightened with the nostalgia of lost dreams. She felt so old, so worn out, so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of oregano on the porch and the smell of roses at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the parvenus. Her heart of compressed ash, which had resisted the most telling blows of daily reality without strain, fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years eroded her. She became human in her solitutde.\n\nI can't wait to read everything this man has ever written, though I am trying to keep my expectations realistic since I know this is considered his best work.",

        "text": "I feel I am witnessing the death of reading as a hobby. I come from a country/community where book reading is not encouraged. Parents don’t read and are occupied with their illuminated screens, so the child is raised with YouTube videos in background. In schools, there is no system of asking students to submit a report on a book assigned to read. The study of literature in primary and secondary education focusses too much on the 'questions' that will be asked in the ‘exams’; so the obsession to ‘get more marks’ drains the beauty of what the student is reading. Talking to several librarians and book-shop owners reinforced my belief that the situation is getting gloomier every year.\n\nI feel I have spent enough time feeling pity for the ‘kids these days’. I have decided to do something to encourage the next generations of readers. At the age of 8, ‘Around the World in Eighty Days’ found me and ignited my love for reading. I intend to make a list of 25 extraordinary books and donate them to schools with underprivilege kids where libraries are nonexistent. I am sure there is a kid out there whose life will be transformed with the introduction of that one magical book. More info on the endeavor in comments. I’m looking for guidance and suggestions.\n\nHere is the list so far:\n\n1) Around the World in Eighty Days\n\n2) Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\n\n3) The Fellowship of the Ring: Book 1\n\n4) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\n5) The Book Thief\n\n6) Life of Pi\n\n7) Flowers for Algernon\n\n8) Bridge to Terabithia\n\n9) The Call of the Wild\n\n10) A Short History of Nearly Everything\n\n11) Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy\n\n12) Anne of Green Gables\n\n13) The Secret Garden\n\n14) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\n15) The Science of Breakable Things\n\n16) Island of the Blue Dolphins\n\n17) The Color of Magic\n\n18) The Bad Beginning\n\n19) Howl’s Moving Castle\n\n20) The Giver\n\n21) Holes\n\n22) Where the Mountain Meets the Moon\n\n23) When You Reach Me\n\n24) The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\n25) Ender's Game",

        "text": "I picked up The Brothers Karamazov recently. As an atheist that knows NOTHING about religion, I don't understand the arguments at all. And I know that the theme of faith vs reason is one of the central problems that this book tackles, but I just cannot understand it. I've been loving the characters so far, but whenever a long passage that tackles religion comes up, I just find it incredibly hard to follow. I think I know the gist of what the arguments are, but I'm afraid that I'm not getting all the nuances of the novel if I don't understand the religious connotations. It does not help that I am reading this in English, my 2nd language, as well (I'm afraid my native language translation might not correctly convey Dostoyevsky's thoughts). Has anyone had the same problem while reading this?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I apologize if my post does not necessarily follow the subreddit's rules, though I really need some help regarding one book that I do not own and I don't know where else I could ask for help. \n\nEssentially, I am looking for few references that the author Peter Tiersma had used in his book Legal Language, published in 1999. The exact passage is in page 10 and goes like this: \n\n\"It appears that the Anglo-Saxons had no distinct legal profession. **(9)** Yet they did develop a type of legal language, remnants of which have survived until today. Examples include the words bequeth, goods, guilt, land, manslaughter, murder, right, sheriff, steal, swear, theft, thief, and ward. **(10)**\"\n\nThe numbers in brackets are the references that I'm looking for. Currently I'm working on my bachelor's thesis, and this book is essential for it, though since I don't personally have it, I would like to avoid any possible cases of plagiarism thus why the exact references would help me a bunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you very much in advance to anyone, who will lend me a hand here. Please delete this post in the case of a posted answer and my acknowledgment of it.",

I love books like Kafka On The Shore, After Dark(one of my favorites!), and Norweigan Wood. He has a way of writing. It is aesthetic, cohesive, and fluid.\n\nHowever, sometimes, his writing is just...monotonous? It does not portray emotions just like it portrays sensations and feelings. It can get dull and bland after a while and just...I don't know, *descriptive?*\n\nPlus, his writing can get weird at times(like comparing Naoko's nude scene with an \"insect\") though I thought it could be because of cultural phrases and differences.\n\n*(For example, where I live, parents telling kids to \"drink piss of another person who is more talented than you\" is an ordinary statement that can be weird/unsettling to people in other cultures).*\n\nAnd from what I've heard***(I MAY BE WRONG)*** Japanese people tend to correlate nature and environmental elements in their writing and culture.\n\nPlus, I think the reason for the monotone and flavorless writing is that the book is translated by another person into English, which may the reason the book seems to have lost its \"charm\". \n\nThis is purely my speculation.

        "text": "I just finished it. I actually started reading the story on Monday, and admittedly did not expect that I would finish so soon. However, the beginning of the story intrigued me, and from there I couldn’t help but continue reading, day by day. I am inclined to describe it as beautiful, because it was well written, and although it shames me to admit this as someone who graduates from high school in a few months, I did learn new vocabulary terms by reading it. This is one of those books wherein I expected it to be different than it ended up being - I thought that it would be more like “1984,” but it was actually very different. I can see why this is considered a classic, and I wish that we had read this in school. I thought that Bernard would prove to be a character that readers were meant to root for, that he would be similar to Winston Smith in that sense… and yet, in spite of the fact that he was different - considered defective - he was a coward. This story actually made me think more than “1984” did. I was disturbed by what the children were described as doing. I never felt like I knew what direction the plot would head in. Now that I’m done with it, I find myself longing for more… for more of this particular world, to read about the author, to know what his own political convictions were. Between this story and “1984,” this is the book that I would be more eager to re-read. Reading this in 2023, it touched me, it disgusted me, it opened up my mind… I can’t imagine how people in 1932 reacted to it. What a brilliant work.",

The main reason I was initially drawn to the book was because I heard it is one of the most historically accurate Aurthurian fantasy novels out there. I loved how immersive “Winter King” by Bernard Cornwell was and wanted something similar but with more magic. “The Crystal Cave” pretty much fit the bill!\n\nBut when reading it just now, I came across a phrase that completely pulled me out of it:\n&gt;I swung, clinging like a monkey\n\nWell darn it. \n\nIt was going so well too! But that was so anatopic I dont know if my faith as a reader can recover… Monkey? MONKEY?! \n\nAm I supposed to believe that 12 year old Merlin from 5th century Wales would have known what a monkey is?!\n\nSorry, nope. \n\nYes, I’m being a bit overdramatic. But I’m here to make a broader point. This kind of thing seems to happen all the time in “historical” (or historically inspired—especially fantasy) literature and it’s annoying. \n\nAnatopisms and anachronisms have to end. We need to expect more from authors/editors (and seriously dont even get me started on cinema). I’m tired of writers banking on their audiences being uninformed, superficial consumers. \n\nOk, rant over. Thanks for reading and I’ll get back to my book now. I’m still interested enough for now… But I swear, one more anatopism and I’ll DNF. I mean it, Mary! Ok, maybe I could put up with two or three more. But that’s it! \n\nWhat are your favorite anachronisms or anatopisms to hate?",

Maybe it was the rise of social media, maybe it's because I got busy... whatever it was. I feel so upset I have no interest in reading anymore. Currently I'm unemployed due to an upcoming surgery, I have no children and there's really no excuse not to pick up a book. I read the hobbit a few months ago and it was great!!! And once I finished it I once again got tired of reading. I'm reading lord of the rings cause I'm super into the movies and everything. I just have no idea how to kickstart that love of reading anymore :(",

Honestly, I was one of those kids when I was in school. \n\nI think it’s a combination of comprehension and attention problems, stressful timed assignments, and confusing prose in literature. \n\nI think it’s so sad that so many kids will never see the value in reading a good book, and as an educator, I want to help fix it. I just don’t see how we can convince kids that reading is worth their time when they have unlimited access to digital media. \n\nIn my case, I was helping my sister with a book report and read the first Harry Potter book (I was 17), and I realized that I actually enjoyed my time reading it. This was after all of my comprehension and attention issues were trained out of me through assigned reading in school. \n\nUnfortunately now, kids don’t read the assigned reading, so they never fix their comprehension and attention issues. \n\nHow do we help this problem?",

I'm glad I re-read it, as I found it a lot easier to follow/clear this time around (i believe i was quite distracted the first time through, and I'm not good absorbing information, so I often re-read books. They are often also better the second time around in my opinion, and in general re-reading is a joy to me as I get to pick up on little bits I missed the first time and re-experience my favourite parts of the story).\n\nWithout revealing any spoilers, I was really fascinated by the unique ideas presented in this novel. They were really creative and one of a kind, and really brought an aura of mystery to the read, adding to the moody, dark feeling of the novel.\n\nI also really felt drawn to/liked the protagonist. I'm not sure why, but I loved the descriptions of her studying in particular.\n\nWhile I would definitely describe the book as dark, there was something beautiful/magical about this darkness. It's like an enchanted dark Russian fairy tale magic school mashup that takes you on all sorts of twists and turns (at least in my very unprofessional opinion). \n\nThe narratives flowed beautifully, and the language was descriptive yet not overly-flowery, and modern/accessible.\n\nThe plot was fairly fast paced and did not slog in my opinion, which was helpful to keeping my attention on what was going on.\n\nI love magical realism and I'd definitely group this book in that category (but again, this is just in my very unprofessional opinion). I'd be interested in reading other books of a similar style/feel to this one, though again, this novel was really unique.\n\nIf anyone else had thoughts about this novel, I'd be interested to read!",

        "text": "Gil Blas de Santillane is a picaresque novel by writer and playwright Alan-Rene Lesage - published between 1715 and 1735, Gil Blas consists of eleven books divided in four tomes filled to the brim with the titular picaro's adventures in every last square inch of 16th century Spanish society, be it cuckolded  husbands, lusty lords, roving bandits and good old swashbuckling piracy! Gil Blas survives through wit alone as valet to all sorts of masters - from criminally incompetent doctor Sangrado to the master of ministers of the Spanish court, Duke De Lerm; a brief stint as an actor and woeful prisoner really shed light on every last aspect of society in Spain.  \n\n\nI began reading this wonderful patchwork of adventures as part of my diatribe on the picaresque genre and I have to say, other than the mere virtue being entertained, I began to understand why many authors viewed Gil Blas as the 'model' novel in its field - from Smollett to Mark Twain viewing it with awe. The sheer detail and organic flow of this novel immerses the reader and makes one wonder how Lesage can seemingly put an entire period of history in print!  \n\n\nAnyway, this is an appreciation post for Gil Blas. If any of you have read it, I would love to hear your opinion - especially in relation to the general evolution of literature as we know it: I definitely count it among the milestones, at the very least as a source of endless aesthetic inspiration and the setter of many trends we now treat as literary and cultural tapestry that has seemingly always been there.",

        "text": "Hunger Games just came out right when I started my teaching career in middle school. EVERY. SINGLE. girl in middle school was wearing a mockingjay pin and a braid in their hair. So I did read the books because even the boys were into the books because of the violence.\n\nI was also just starting to date my husband and yes this detail is important. Because I was Team Gale allllll the way baby. Gale was the childhood best friend who was all rugged and wild. The boy I dreamed of when I was a teenager.\n\nBut now I am married and fuck Gale. Fuck that hoe all the way to district 13 and back. Fuck that little crybaby of an incel who never grew up. I did grow up and mature in my love life and now understood why Katniss picked Peeta over Gale dumbass.\n\nPeeta is safe. Katniss feels safe with Peeta. Peeta feels like home and gives her comfort. He gives her space when she needs it and there when she can't stand being alone. I have childhood PTSD and sure my husband isn't the sexy mountain man I thought I would marry as a teenager, but he made me feel safe. Safety in a partner is so damn important. A valuable element to any relationship. So many people want the one person they can run to so they can feel safe, and that is my husband.\n\nWhere do I start with the fuck up parts. Um how about District 11 is a fucking plantation and Rue and Thresh are fucking slaves. Shack homes. Children force out of school to work in the fields. THEY ARE BLACK AND THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE IN PANEM. Just like slaves they are not allowed to eat the food they harvest, they get the leftovers. I love the detail that singing is so important and a vital part of District 11 culture, just like slavery. Slaves would sing to pass the time in the fields, keep their culture alive, and help each other find the underground railroad. The underground railroad is an act of rebellion. Rue death and singing to Rue was the start of the rebellion.\n\nOh and then they take the dead tributes and turn them into monsters. They take dead tiny 12 year old Rue and turn her into a mindless monster.\n\nI love the world building because it is so well done. In the books you don't leave your district. Some higher leaders may leave the district if they are invited to the capital or have permission to. The only way people can communicate in other districts is through the Hunger Games. Katniss had no idea things were fucked up in District in 11 until she met Rue. And there is a 99.99% chance you ain't going back home to tell how fucked up other things are in other districts.\n\nMaybe if you are a Career tribute and have better communication. But things are not that bad in the upper districts so thing are not that bad. The Hunger Games books have some balls to the walls themes that connect to the whole 99% vs 1%. Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter. Police brutality. And how Capitalism sucks butthole.\n\nThe Careers are the 1% and are brainwash since birth. Thinking they are worth nothing unless they train for the games and bring home victory. They can eat all day long so how bad can things possibly be for the lower districts? Katniss thought Rue kept the food since she is the district that harvests all the food. Rue thought Katniss kept all the coal and nobody went cold because they are the coal district. And this is from the two lowest districts, how bad is the propaganda in the upper districts.\n\nAnd the capital totally controls the games. The Capital loves the upper districts and turns a blind eye to the illegal training they do. They want their favorite characters to win the games. Sometimes they spice things up and kill the careers by creating a natural disaster to kill their food supplies. The elements always kill the careers because they never went cold or got hunger at night. The lower districts are use to it and the game makers KNOW THIS. So when the people of the capital want to spice things up or get bored with a career winning year after year. *poof* here comes a flood or natural disaster. Now the lower districts have a chance of winning and that fills their need for a change in the game.\n\nThey tried to kill Katniss in book one with a firewall for throwing the arrow at the game maker. They tried to kill her again in Catching Fire by throwing her in the games again. And I love that the game maker for Catching Fire shows her his watch as a hint. His watch has a mockingjay symbol, he is part of the rebellion and tried to save her by showing her the watch BECAUSE THE GAME IS A CLOCK IN THAT BOOK.\n\nAnd let's talk about Madge. The daughter of the mayor of District 12. She is humble and down to earth because she is probably looked down on as trash by the other leader's children because she is District 12 daughter. \n\nI think she knew District 13 was still a thing or heard a rumor or whatever. The mayor buys Katniss strawberries, she knows Katniss is a risk taker by going out to the forbidden woods. And she will do anything to protect her family. I think the Madge knew the Mockingjay was a symbol of rebellion in the last uprising and gave Katniss the pin to let the other rebels know that this girl can be the key to starting things.\n\nCinna jumped on the train to be district 12 costume designer asap despite NOBODY wanting the job. I think he knew and that is why he wanted to dress Katniss up so badly. She was the actual fucking flame to start the rebellion. And that is why he was killed in Catching Fire. \n\nAlso can we talk about the sex trafficking???? The sponsors are paying to save the tributes life in the games so they can clap cheeks with them after the games??? Finnik is my favorite character and I just want to hug him. Can you imagine the fucking hell if Katniss was the single winner in book one? That last package of a meal from the sponsors was fucking EXPENSIVE. She probably had so many sponsors and would have gone through fucking hell after the game. Everyone would have wanted to have slept with The Girl on Fire.\n\nNo wonder Haymich is a drunk. What horrors did he face after surviving 47 tributes? They doubled the amount of tributes for the special 50th games. He was a special winner for such a special game and I can't imagine how many people want a piece of that special winner. And then year after year he has had to watch two starving children die. He drinks and lives alone so he doesn't have to have a wife live with the aftermath or have children face certain death. it is why Katniss doesn't want kids.\n\nAnd I love that in the epilogue that she had kids with Peeta. Symbolism that means the games are over and it is safe to have them.\n\nAnd in Catching Fire Katniss said that at least in district 12 they have the freedom to marry. Does that mean in other districts there are arranged marriages? Making winners marry winners so they can produce babies with a higher chance of winning the games? Katniss did say that children of pass winners have entered the games and died. She thinks the capital rigs the drawings so those kids are taken to the games to get killed. I think it is a way to keep the winners in line\n\nBecause they never remove the tracker in the winners. It is a way to keep an eye on the winners. What if the winner rebels, or as Finnik said if he said no to sex *poof* the love of his life gets killed. If victors step a toe out of line, their children will get reaped and killed. Which is why that one tribute was so pissed in Catching Fire. She kept in line and kept her mouth shut AND GOT REAPED AGAIN. \n\nAlso the PTSD is so well written in the books. My best friend aka my brother from another mother lives with us. Why? Because he is an Afgan vet and got his legs blown up in that sandpit. He is missing everything below the knees and is so mentally fucked up to the point he legally can't live alone.\n\nJust like Haymich, he use to drink and refuse to bring a lover into his personal hell. He is sober now and trying to date. Just like Katniss, he can have some very bad nightmares. There are some nights I wake up to him screaming. It is better now because we just drug him with an ass load of medical marijuana. 10 hours of dreamless sleep. \n\nBut some nights are still hard for him to fall asleep or he wakes up scared and just doesn't know why. Some nights I will be curled up next to my husband and feel someone else get into bed next to me. I will feel these hands wrap around me and pull me in. Then I hear soft sniffling and then soft snoring.\n\nIt reminds me of when Peeta gets into bed with Katniss because the nightmares are so bad. It is just vice versa for us on who gets into who's bed.\n\nALSO the ads for this movie. The ads were just like the Capital, so damn focus on Team Gale and Team Peeta. When the entire point of the books was NOT Team Gale and Team Peeta. The point is that we should fight back on an unjust government, eat the rich, and learn to recognize propaganda. Also Gale never had a fucking chance, let's be real. \n\nAlso glad Gale was played by Liem Heimsworth. That cheating douche bag fit Gale incel \"boo hoo Katniss won't kiss me\" attitude. He only thought about himself and not the situation Katniss was put in. \n\nI also love that Isabella Furhman played the knife crazy tribute, Clove. She was the actor who played Ester in the movie Orphan. \n\nI think I am done gushing about this book. I just had to let this all out. Please no Snake and Song bird spoilers, my husband and I have yet to read the book. We are half way down with Mockingjay and I'm stalling my feet because Finnik is my favorite person in the books and I know what is coming. \n\nSeriously, reread this book as an adult.",

So far, the tone is really more \"Harry Potter but make it dark and sexy.\" Does it actually deliver in the end? \n\n\\- Sexuality: She emphasized that her characters were \"100% sexually fluid,\" but except for one throwaway line, the book feels *very* straight so far. \n\n\\- Characterization: ALL the narrators feel the same to me. If I pick up in the middle of a chapter, I often can't tell whose POV it is except by process of elimination. Does the characterization get better/more three dimensional? Or if I don't relate to the characters by now, is this book just not for me?",

Obviously every school is different, so I'm curious what commonly-read books never made it to your school curriculum? Are you reading them now, or ignoring them?\n\nFor me, examples include The Diary of Anne Frank, The Lord of the Flies, and 1984. I've read 1984 since but haven't gotten around to the others.",

        "text": "I don't love reading anymore, and that's not okay. I studied literature in undergrad and graduate school. I took my hand at writing for 6 years (about 4 hours a day); and I think trying to create a novel ruined my ability to simply read. Most recently I started House of Leaves. Loved it at first, but then it became ostentatious and I lost interest. Going to what I thought would be a sure-fire win, I picked up Donna Tartt's Secret History. Everyone and their mother loves this book--but again, while loving it initially, I got tired of the long winded nothingness. I enjoy McCarthy, Jim Harrison; I've read and enjoyed Moby Dick in and out of school; I loved YA at one point, and Peter Pan remains a favorite. Even when I read things like Jim Butcher I get bored. Perhaps I'm exhausted on the human condition. Perhaps my cynicism has reached a tipping point. Perhaps TV has ruined my attention. Truly, I do love reading. From it I think more clearly, sleep better, and expand my universe. But at the moment, everything feels like a letdown. I've taken breaks from reading in the past, but now I feel like I'm breaking up with reading and I don't want to. Help!",
