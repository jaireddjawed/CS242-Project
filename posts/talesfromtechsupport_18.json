        "text": "I work as a sysadmin at a large car dealership.\n\n\nNext year, I will have been here 15 years.  Now that might seem strange in the IT world, but it is fairly normal in the Automotive industry (outside of sales).\n\n\nSince I have worked here so long, and outlived a lot of other staff members, I've aquired a lot of knowledge about this company, the procedures and the buildings that would normally have been lost to the sands of time.  More often than not, I tend to be included in things that normally wouldn't be in IT's purview, but simply because I am the only one who can answer the questions that people ask.\n\n\nEarlier today, one of our admin clerks wandered over to my desk and said the Head Clerk had a problem with a mouse.  I already fixed a simliar problem this morning by telling someone to get rid of their new mousepad with red stripes on it, so I still had \"computer mouse\" stuck in my head.  I finished what I was doing and went to see HC.\n\nMe:  \"Hello HC, I heard you had a mouse problem, is it still an issue?\"\n\nHC: \"Yes, can you fix the hole?\"\n\nMe: \".................what hole?\"\n\nHC: \"I think there is a hole back there *points at a very heavy cabinet*\n\nMe: \"Wait, what?\"\n\nHC: \"That's where the mouse ran out from\"\n\nMe: \"....Ahh\"\n\n\nSo I ended up lugging her cabinet away from the wall, and finding out the wall had a space between it and the ground, so there was no way I could patch it.  During this time, I was putting up with the admin clerks asking me not to kill it but to release it to the wild (I am in Australia, they are classed as feral pests.  Sorry mouse, but it is clobbering time.)\n\n\nI then dropped a line to the de facto property manager about getting some pest controllers out here.  \n\n\nI then briefly mused about getting an office snake for pest control. Like the red belly black snake I chased out of one of our dealerships about six years back.  \n\n\nNext time your company is looking for a Systems Administrator, make sure they advertise for \n\"Animal Control Experience\" as one of the required skills.",

        "text": "It's been almost a year since I started working for the current company as our only sysadmin and besides backups, disabling users and adding new users and the other usual stuff my work on the Exchange Server has been rather low. The wiring inside the server room is a disaster but it should stay as it is, as one of my predecessors must have screwed it up somehow while trying to fix it. So just keep in mind that it looks really messy on the backside of the server racks.\n\n---------------------\n\nIn this story the RAID I'm talking about is a 1+0 RAID.\n\n-------------------\n\nIt is Sunday, 30 minutes before the game Germany vs Mexico as $boss calls me to notify me that her E-Mails aren't working. I log in to OWA of our Exchange, it synchronizes but when I try open any E-Mail I get http 500 error after a while....strange. I contact some of my colleagues on random messenger and ask them whether they can read any E-Mails. They confirm they can but $boss wants a solution now. Fine...I drive over to work and boot up my pc.\n\nI'm greeted by Updates being installed...GREAT! I go into the kitchen, get myself some coffee and come back. Still updates...seriously? Fine, I didn't have lunch, so I head to the gas station 20 yards/meters away and get myself some sandwiches. Still updates...ugh, this is not going to be my day is it?! Fast-forward another 10-15 minutes, sandwiches eaten, dump taken, spotted a cat outside, playing with it...update were finally finished. If you wonder why I didn't just go into the server room, the answer is a) I was in no rush, I'm missing the game anyway b) I hate standing while working c) Our air conditioning unit is crap and cannot cool the room down below 30°C/86°F, so now way I'm going into that hell. Yes, this was reported to $boss, but no she isn't upgrading the unit or calling the maintenance-company. $boss is beyond my comprehension of stupid, I stopped trying to understand her after about 2-3 months of being there.\n\nBack to the issue. So I remote onto the server and just reboot it and pray. Still cannot read any E-Mails. Okay, I guess I gotta go into that hellhole and see if any of the HDDs died. It did, the red light is laughing at me (\"Oh, you not going home so early, fella!\"). I check the RAID settings, yep, it's gone. I pull the crap out with some difficulties as I'm clumsy and already frustrated. I reboot the system again, hoping the malfunctioning HDD might have caused some weird error or so. I use the time to walk down to my PC again. But nope, again no improvement. Actually, I started getting \"The administrator has done bla bla\" and nothing was loading at outlook. Ummm what?\n\nOk ok, keep calm, there has to be an explanation for all this. I head back to the server room to see if any other HDD just went bonkers, but no. *Mixed sigh of relief and confusion*...*heads back down again*\n\nRemoting back onto the server and see that the Active Mailbox is gone. The DBs for Archive and public folders (I know, I know, don't ask, this is a story for itself) are still there. *Turning pale* What the...? Why? HOW? We had a malfunctioning HDD before at our PDC. I pulled it out, ordered a new one, it arrived 2 days later and I put it in and let the RAID rebuild itself. Success. But how can a DB disappear if just one of the two HDDs of that RAID is gone? That's impossible (at least as far as I know). At that time I started grasping at straws as that pretty much tilted my brain. I ordered a new HDD to be delivered ASAP, and started planning on putting the last backup on that new RAID and hope it would reappear again (I knew this was wishful thinking, but I had no idea what was going on). I drove home, telling $boss there wont be any E-Mails for a while.\n\nThe next day, I tell that to the person who helped out a bit around one of my predecessors. He walks into the server room and comes back and asks me:\n\n&gt;$Coworker: Did you unplug the external HDD from the server?\n\n&gt;$Me: The what?\n\n&gt;$Coworker: The exchange server had an external HDD in the back. Did you unplug it?\n\n&gt;$Me: I didn't even know that there was one.\n\n&gt;$Coworker: Well, the Active Database is on that.\n\n&gt;$Me: WHAT? But why? Why out of all the 3 databases we have, why put the most important one on an external HDD with no RAID? Who came up with that idea?\n\n&gt;$Coworker: Well, we did, after your predecessor quit and the databases were growing too big for the RAID.\n\nFast-forward few hours of plugging it back in, fixing the DB-inconsistency that was caused, the E-Mails started working again. Somehow we assume that I must have \"unplugged\" a rather loose external HDD while getting the malfunctioning HDD out of the server, shaking the whole thing a bit. The loose external HDD was probably the cause of the initial problem too, as we found no other explanation for it.\n\n-----------\n\nI don't have many years of experience under my belt. So if you can, refrain from roasting me for something I've done wrong and rather say what I should have done instead. We actually ordered 2 HDDs to finally have 1 as backup. Before $boss saw no need in \"wasting\" money for something that just dusts up in the storage room. And I hope you enjoyed the story.\n\nEdit: Fixing typos/grammar.\n\nEdit2: Added info about what RAID it is.",

        "text": "So, a bit of background. Two or so months ago, my company migrated our exchange log in, as well as our time tracking, and just about every other thing to SSO.\n\nSome people are still having issues coming to terms with it, and have elected to ignore the weekly emails telling them to update their profiles with their current contact info, et cetera.\n\nEnter condescending, old i-want-your-manager type woman. I'll call her S for this story. I'll be M. \n\nS: I can't log in to timetable website to update my W2 form. HR said they are withholding my payment until I submit the form, and the stupid website says I have the wrong password, which is what I've always used. Just reset it for me. \n\nM: hello S, I would just like to remind you that timetable website was migrated to SSO, so please use yo-\n\nS: are you deaf? I said reset it, so chop chop. \n\nM: in trying to tell you that the password you've always used changed as o-\n\nS: All I want to hear from you is \"yes ma'am\" and \"here is your password\" \n\nBy now. I've noticed that her profile is incomplete. Or rather, it is half assedly filled in. Her contact number is 123456789, with no alternate email, nor her extension number. Part of our verification process is to match the caller ID number, with the one on her profile, or to send a OTP to either her work or alternate email. On password resets, we can bypass the OTP and just reset the password and have it emailed to their work or alternate emails, since their active session will allow them to receive it and later update it. \n\nM: I have sent your password to your work email. \n\nS: can't you read it off to me? \n\nM: no, unfortunately the number you are calling from is not listed on your profile, you will have to retrieve it from your email. \n\nAfter a bit of angry muttering, she comes back. \n\nS: outlook is popping up with a password thing, it wont update. \n\nOh shit, she didn't have outlook open, thus no active session. Dis_gon_b_gud.gif\n\nM: unfortunately, the only alternative I have is to resend your password to your manager. \n\nS: She is on maternity leave. NOTHING WORKS NOW, I CAN'T LOG IN TO ANYTHING WHAT DID YOU DO! \n\nM: exactly what you asked me to do. I reset your password. \n\nS: I TOLD YOU I ONLY NEEDED IT FOR TIMETABLE SITE! \n\nM: yes ma'am, you did. And I told you it was part of the SSO. I even tried to get you to try your current network password, but you demanded I reset it anyway. \n\nS: I have to turn this in today, I can't wait for my manager to come back. \n\nM: I can email her manager, explaining the situation, and you can try to contact them about it as well. \n\nS: that is idiotic, why are you doing this to me?! \n\nM: I simply did as you demanded. \n\nAfter a lot of angry bargaining, she came to terms with the fact that I was not going to help her, and reluctantly agreed to contact her managers manager. \n\nThing is, when I sent the email after I had released the call, I got an out of office notification from him. He is out till the end of the month. \n\nEnjoy! \n\nTl;dr: got nagged to reset a SSO password causing the user to lock herself out of everything, no alternate contact, and her superiors are on leave.\n\nEDIT: So, have I got an update. She went to HR \"in tears and mumbles\" about how we at IT refused to help her and mocked her predicament. So her HR point of contact wrote to the HR head of department, who in turn copied the Service Desk GM, who in turn wrote an email directed to all of us asking for more insight.\n\nI got the call ID, and wrote my side of the story. Since her profile is still locked as of now, I was able to retrieve screenshots of everything, which were attached. I explained that it was my intention to contact her again, to let her know that the manager I contacted was also out of office, but due her profile not having any reliable contact information, I was unable to do so. I noticed that an external @publicdomain account was CC'd. I assumed it was her. And because I work in an office environment, I don't know the difference between reply and reply all. So I hit reply all.\n\nWhat followed can only be described as divine. GM instructed the Service Desk team to immediately direct any caller identifying as S directly to HR. This one was sent only to us. A \"separate, detailed e-mail\" will be sent to HR, and they are to handle her until further notice.\n\nI had a 20 minute or so meeting, with my manager and GM on the line. They asked why I refused to look for alternatives. I explained that in my experience working at American Express, I saw a lot of social engineering attacks that followed a similar pattern, with no verifiable account information, and an overly aggressive user demanding information on the account. I expressed that I had a gut feeling that someone was trying to exploit a weakness in the service desk, and decided to stick to the guidelines and exhaust all established options, including having the alleged user meet with their manager. I am to draft a document explaining the red flags to watch out for, to protect the accounts and prevent phishing attempts. ",

        "text": "Here is a story about why you should watch what you say (to a degree) TLDR at the end.\n\nBefore I weave this tale of magic and mystery I need to give a little background. I work at a large university and everything is sectioned off. I work for $primary-HD which applies to everyone. Employees have $departmental-HDs that will do everything beyond password changes/verification/simple web stuff. \n\nThe story's cast: $me (that guy), $C (client - employee of the University), and $CIT (Client's departmental-HD).\n\n$me: Standard greeting\n\n$c: (already yelling) I CAN'T LOG ON.\n\n$me: ...k... may i have your $info?\n\n$CIT: yea this is $CIT and $C here, here is her $info, and as you heard, she cannot log in.\n\n$me: oh, ok, so what are you trying to log into\n\n$C: everything!\n\n\\*\\*keep in mind that we use about quite a few systems University-wide and each department has their own, on top of that some have different passwords/usernames\\*\\*\n\n$me: ok, can you log into $main site for the University?\n\n$C: NO \n\n$CIT: she can't log in anywhere, she just told you that.\n\n$me: ok, let me look over a few things \\*\\*mutes phone\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*note, we don't really put people on hold at this University, we always just mute ourselves, just in case they have an ah-ha moment or if something pops up on their screen that we need to know, guess they didn't know that...\\*\\*\n\n$C: \\*scoff\\* wow, he has no idea does he?\n\n$CIT: Yea those $primary-HD people are really the bottom of the barrel. They don't know anything, just, they are they are the only ones who can do anything with passwords. Sorry you have to deal with him.\n\n$me: \\*internally\\* well, that's swell. \n\nThen I notice that the username has NO attempts to log in. No incorrect passwords. Nothing. No access attempts for the entire day.\n\n$me: \\*I take myself off of mute\\* oh, so I actually don't see any attempted log ins at this time\n\n$C: I am trying to log in right now, did you see THAT?\n\n$me: no, I didn't, but I think I know the issue; $CIT and $C, can you check if the caps lock is on? As you know all of our usernames are case sensitive.\n\n\\*\\*a hush\\*\\*\n\n$C: ok I can log in now, thanks.\n\n\\*\\*I am not done yet\\*\\*\n\n$me: oh, and just so you know, as your $CIT said, ANY technical issue can be solved by reaching out to YOUR $departmental-HD. We do have training and most have A+ certifications so we can troubleshoot a lot of issues, but the $departmental-HDs have requested to cover any issues you may have, that is why as $CIT said, I am pretty much just a password person. ... anything else?  \n$CIT: no... thanks  \n\n\nBONUS - This call was pulled by our head of IT ($primary HD) and I just saw that the $CIT was pulled into the office. The name of the meeting on his calendar - discussing appropriate banter and relationships with other IT departments. \n\nTLDR: Caps lock is not your friend and remember that people can hear you.",

        "text": "Time for a fresh story I've been working the last four to five months.\n\n**Backstory:** So we have this client that we have done work for off and on for several years, mostly major implementation help and recovery services in VM. Over the course of time they seemed pretty good on what they are doing once we turn it over till a few months ago and we were asked to do a check-up on their environment and give some recommendations.\n\n**Cast: Me - No explanation**\n\n**IT Director**\n\n**DBA**\n\nBack oh about the first of the year our client asked us to come in and give a once over of their environment and offer up some recommendations for best practices. It kinda went like this.\n\n&gt;Me: First thing that we noticed needing immediate attention is a majority of your servers have either never been updated or haven't been since we installed them three, four, five years ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IT Dir: We update our environment on a regular basis with WSUS in SCCM.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Well I'm here to let you know that each of these servers and here is the list of last known updates haven't been done since X time. Also sampling your desktops they haven't been updated in years either.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IT Dir: We will look into this and get back with you.\n\nAt this point months go by and we get called back out to right size the ship and get some of the updates in order. It was at this point we scheduled with them and their Sys Admins to work up a plan. We setup a few dates during the day to work on updates on systems that can be rebooted during the day and another set of dates and times for servers needing to be rebooted after hours.\n\nIt was at this point the DBA got involved, someone who we felt knew about the DBs but nothing on the environment in which it was working upon. They give us a couple action items like manually restarting specific services after reboots, etc.\n\nThe days come and we set to work with the on-site staff. Several days in this happens.\n\n&gt;DBA: You broke the \"application\" you need to take off all the Windows Updates and service packs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: We asked for a list of dependencies and applications to be aware of, you gave us, XYZ and ABC. Nothing was mentioned about ActiveX and .NET  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DBA: Well all the updates need to be removed to make our applications work\n\nIt was at this point it went through a back and forth of explaining the process of updating Windows Server and software for security, features, etc.\n\nThis didn't seem to sit well with the DBA and they didn't seem to understand they would need to update their applications accordingly. Some of them from what we found a decade plus old using insecure technologies/programming and EOL SQL Server.\n\nIn the end, the IT Dir sided with the DBA and didn't have them update their applications and had us remove all Windows Updates.\n\n**TL:DR;** DBA didn't think it was imperative to update their applications and it was better to run a production environment on insecure and in some cases EOL systems.\n\nSide note: About a month maybe six weeks after this all went down, their main file server got hit with a cryptolocker and spread to a couple other systems including their on-prem Exchange. It was a 30 - 35 hour recovery job.\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

        "text": "One thing I cannot stand is how we have this big push to standardize our processes so that we can reuse them across multiple clients. For instance, if a client wants us to import data from their ADP system into one of the services we offer, we don't want to create a one time import process. We want to create a generic import process that will accept ADP formatted exports. Even better would be if we could specify the format of the import file, then we could create one generic process for all future requests but that never happens.\n    \nSo one of our services we offer is that we can take clients HR Data and use it in our trip approval process. We get HR Data indicating who is whose manager and send out approval emails required to be actioned prior to flights being booked within certain parameters. Well, one client indicated that their HR department was unreliable and so they wanted us to hard-code in the approvers for a few employees. I pushed back, as a few years down the line someone was going to wonder why the approval went to the wrong manager but alas no one listens to Kik. I make the change and I comment it in the SP with the name and date of the request.\n    \n3 years later...\n    \nI am now stuck at work late because of an emergency email. See, the client previously mentioned split up into multiple companies. A trip for VP@company1.com was not booked because the approver never approved it. The approver never approved it, because the approver is actually CIO@company2.com (Approver information is just an email address and first/last name so cross company approvals can happen and are legitimate in some scenarios.)\n    \nLuckily, I keep my emails. I found the original request, my arguments against and them being overridden. So now I am waiting for the original requester to be able to be found at company1 in order to get approval to remove the hard coded values.",

I've posted once before, just got off the phone with a short one that I'm sure some of you have seen before. \n\nBackground: I work at the Level 1 support level for a government department ($GD below). We only do internal support. Most of our calls are for password resets to various systems (some of which we actually manage).\n\nToday's cast has just two people. $Me = well, me. And $FU = Frustrated User.\n\n&gt; $Me: Thank you for calling $GD support desk. This is $me, how can I help you today?\n\n&gt; $FU: Hi, I've tried my password like 10 times and it just won't take. Can you just reset it for me? I'm so tired of it not taking what I know is the correct password. \n\n&gt; $Me: Well, after the third failed attempt, it would have locked your account. Can I get your user ID please?\n\n*Gather user information. I look at their profile, they aren't locked out, which is odd.*\n\n&gt; $Me: I'm not seeing you ask locked out at the moment. Was this happening recently? \n\n&gt; $FU: Yes, I just tried it again and it's still telling me that the user name or password is incorrect. \n\nI double check their account, and see no logon attempts within the past 4 hours, let along couple minutes. I'm thinking that maybe the customer has a leading space in front of their user name. It's happened in the past, and would look exactly like what I'm seeing from my end. Rather than ask them to make sure their username is entered correctly, or describe to them what a \"space\" looks like, I decide to remote in and show them.\n\n&gt; $Me: **$FU**, are you on your usual computer? May I remote in to assist?\n\n&gt; $FU: Yes! Please do!\n\nI remote in, and am barely able to hit the mute button just before my head hits the desk, me chuckling to myself. I take a deep breath, and unmute myself...\n\n&gt; $Me: **$FU**, I believe I see the problem. Could you please type in your user ID in the \"User ID\" field?\n\nI am looking at her screen, dots in the password field, and the cursor hovering over the login arrow, but with the user's login ID completely missing from the required field. She does as I instruct,  and gets logged in almost immediately, thanking me for my help. \n\n&gt;TL:DR - User trying to login without the \"User\" part. Doesn't go well. ",

The battery is completely drained. This won't be the first time someone has thrown a laptop in a box turned on and shipped it. So I connect it to a charge and give it a few minutes. Got to power it on again: twp post beeps, and a blank display.\n\nOk, fine. Find the right cables and connect an external monitor. Reboot it. The BIOS is complaining about the date. Press F1 for BIOS or ESC to continue. Well, I'm not overly concerned about the date right now so ESC... Nothing... ESC ESC ESC. Still nothing. F1. Nothing there either.\n\nSo now I'm off to get a keyboard. Ok, external monitor and keyboard connected, let's try again. F1 for BIOS and I'm in. Yup, the BIOS thinks it's a few seconds after midnight on Jan 1, 2001. Set it to the current date and reboot again.\n\nStill complains about date and time... Yup, it's Jan 1 again. Bypass it... finally will I get somewhere with this?\n\nNope! Windows won't boot. Putting this one aside for now...\n\nTLDR; User returns broken laptop. Turns out there are 3 hardware and 1 software problem, making it the most broken laptop I've seen in this job.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, yadda yadda. Love reading stories here. Keep up the good work. I don't know how to format, so hopefully this comes out okay.\n\nI have worked for the US Army as a contractor on and off for about 8 years. Even when I was in, I knew that a lot of what we did just didn't make sense. On the outside looking in, it's nice to not be a part of most of the nonsense. But sometimes I still have to deal with it. My previous time as a civilian has been as an instructor, operator of simulators for instruction, and somewhat maintainer of such machines. Now, all I am responsible for is maintaining the systems with help on instruction only if necessary.\n\nOne day last week, my coworker and I powered on and prepared all the simulators for the day's events. It usually takes less than an hour for both buildings, and we both get in at around 0730, ready for school to start at 0830. Our normal routine is complete, and we are both in our respective offices. Instructors and students begin entering the building and settling in for some good ol' training.\n\nAbout a half hour into training, my coworker comes into my office and says there's a problem that he needs help fixing. He technically outranks me, but is a little newer to the maintenance of the systems. He used to be an instructor, so he is adept at operating the simulators in support of the training, but not necessarily on the troubleshooting side.\n\nme = me\n\ncw = coworker\n\n&gt;cw: Hey dude, can you come look at the simulator. There's a lot of beeping, and some computers and projectors shut off.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: Did you check to make sure the UPS are on and receiving power?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;cw: Of course I did. I don't know what it could be.\n\nI forgot to tell you, the simulator consists of two projectors, a large rack with shuttle computers on shelves inside of it, two UPS, and a main power source. I don't even know what to call this thing, but it provides power to the UPS. It's super old, too.\n\n&gt;me: It sounds like the UPS are not receiving power. That's what happens when they beep like that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;cs: Well, I don't know. I hooked up everything like normal and it's not working.\n\nSo we go down the hall and I hear the beeping which definitely tells me that there is a power problem. When I enter the room it is plain as day. The instructor plopped his bag down right in front of the main power source and toggled the switch down. I moved his bag and turned the switch back on. The instructor was notably embarrassed and apologized for the bonehead move, and my coworker facepalmed himself for forgetting that while he may have done the right thing in setup, users will inevitably undo that work in some fashion.\n\nThis brings me to my previous point of nonsense. Since I began doing this kind of work, we have always been mandated to shut off the UPS and the main power source every day. I do not understand why. When I have asked, the main answer at all the places I have worked has been to protect the equipment from surges due to lightning strikes. I do not know if that holds any water. I am not a true IT dude.\n\nThe problem that I have seen recurring is that the simulator throws errors. There are licenses that are distributed throughout the system when it is powered on, and they are dependent on a proper date/time to work. But because we always turn the power off, the CMOS batteries in the shuttle computers die, and the dates for the computers go back decades (I might be exaggerating that part).\n\nSo every few months, depending on how much use the simulators get, licensing will fail and we will have to manually set the date/time on each computer upon every start up until we get new CMOS batteries. I do not know why we do this to ourselves. These expensive ass Tripp-Lite UPS surely have surge protection.",

        "text": "Hi all, long time lurker happily reporting that TFTS indeed is the best of the best, and saved the day for some friends of mine recently.\n\n\nYou see, my two friends run this company. Just the two of them. They instruct people in how to do things. Things to do with animals. They know what they are talking about when it comes to that; their tech? Not so much. So when they had a presentation as part of their work, they had it well tested. And still they ran into a massive problem.\n\n\nThe first laptop would suddenly restart before loading the presentation. Bit of a panic, but hey, they have another one. Prepared for sucess, these two. Strange, because it worked the night before. Still, time is ticking, just boot the other one and fix later. But... The same thing happens with this second laptop. Panic is in the air. I get hijacked away from the coffee stand to see if I could get it to work. \n\n\nIntructor One promptly (and quite skillfully) connects the laptop to everything it is supposed to be connected to, and starts typing to load up the presentation. It reboots. She swears a little. I am perplexed; there was no warning, no error message, it had power, battery is full... Hm. Interesting.\n\n\nIt was then I remembered one of You figuring a similar case out not too long ago. My lurking is about to pay off. I ask Instructor One to please remove her watch - a Fitbit/smartwatch type of thing. Lo and behold! Taking off the watch stopped triggering the sleep function! The night was saved, I got oooh's and aaaah's from the customers that was close enough to enjoy the problem-solving, and we all had coffee. The presentation went on without a hitch and all had a good time. \n\n\nSo thank you, User-whos-name-I-cannot recall at this moment. You saved a day and a fair bit of money. Thank you TFTS for existing, or this would never have been solved.   ",

There are no tiers within Helpdesk, but we are split into phone agents and roving agents. We send rovers for hardware issues or networking issues that stop us from remoting into the user's computer. The REST of the IT department is made up of 25ish different app teams.

I try all the basics, close the app and restart, clear the server side session, check all the clear all the device temp files, group policy update, checked the secure network connection, I pull up my documentation of 'Common Issues' for that app, provided to us by each app team so we don't bug them with the common quirks of their own system. Try all of that. At no point does the user try to stop me or say 'I tried that already.' Remember that, it will be important.

Meaning I just spent half my last call troubleshooting his own app for him.\n\n&gt;Shmo: I already did everything I can from my side. It can't be my app. There has to be a different problem and you need to find it and fix it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mayo: We ruled out the other systems during the 20 minutes I just spent troubleshooting with you.

        "text": "Hi all! I wanted to share a story from a previous employer. We weren't a hosting company, but we had some virtuals running customers' systems, mostly because we had inherited them from new customers. The company I worked for was dying, the writing was on the wall and the company owner was desperate getting new customers, ANY new customers. As a last ditch effort he hired a new sales guy as the old totally useless one had just walked.\n\nThe new sales guy comes to me on his second day. He tells me he has scored us a client. I look the client up and oh, it is somewhat (locally) known company that has their own web shop in addition to physical store. The deal goes through and the migration for their web shop begins. I was expecting getting an intact virtual machine, but instead I'm told I'd be only getting SSH account to the dedicated virtual where the shop ran and was supposed to move it on file level. I groan, install a fresh virtual machine with matching OS and examine the old setup. Nothing fancy there, just a well known CMS with some custom parts added. \n\nAt that point I'm contacted by the customer's IT guy. I tell him I'm ready for the migration on next Saturday. He says it sounds good and off we go.\n\nSaturday comes. I move the database and the files without problems. I see the site is running fine on its new home and leave it at that.\n\nThe next monday morning I get an angry call from the their IT guy. He asks if I had installed it. What 'it'? The migration. I'm at a complete loss here, until it becomes clear he doesn't know what migration means. I suddenly get this sinking feeling that rest of this gig is going to be very painful.\n\nThe problem is that when new items are added to the store, they don't show up anywhere. The customer makes several really angry and ranty phone calls to us, while I scratch my head at the whole thing. Then I learn the sales guy has taken off, apparently he found a better job (or he learned about our company's declining state) and he's no longer working as a buffer between me and the customer. Thanks a lot!\n\nNo one knows anything about the web store itself, it's a extensive modification to the CMS and for what I see, it isn't very pretty code. It isn't even a proper module, it's more like cancer that has grown over all parts of the system. I also can't find any kind of interface to manage the products, just the CMS control panel and there's nothing there. I try asking the IT guy how exactly they add new items to the store. He tells me to enter the numbers to the browser. I'm at loss, what numbers? He gets angry and tells me just to start typing the numbers, the rest will show up. We go around with this, until I can convince him to take a photo of his screen.\n\nAha! He enters an IP address as an URL. Turns out there's a second virtual machine no one told me about. No one knows any shell account passwords there nor where it actually is. At this point we're long into monday and the customer is already nuclear because they wanted some products added to the store that went on sale today. I examine the database from the old installation and behold, the changes are there. I pull the added pages from there, find couple of pictures added on the file system and the customer quiets down for a while, but the IT guy is still yelling at me because we're incompetent and botched up the simplest thing.\n\nTracking down the company that made the web shop modification to the CMS was another thing. The customer didn't know about it and I learn that they are a couple that just bought the company. I track down the previous owner, he tells me his son's friend has a company that made it. I contact them, turns out it's just a bunch of young hotshot 'web dev' kiddos. The interesting tidbit I get from them however is that the IP address for the product management interface is on their server. I ask for the files, but they refuse, telling me it's their proprietary system. They however are willing to change the IP address where the product manager connects and after opening the MySQL port for their IP (which I strongly object about) and adding a shell user for their script, the products are now added to the right installation.\n\nBut behold, it still doesn't work 100%. The system has all kinds of random glitches, like wrong pictures showing up, broken pictures, some pages just crashing etc. The customer gets angry again and makes so angry call to me that I have to tell them I'm not taking that level of abuse. I dive into the horrible spaghetti they call PHP code and come to a conclusion that this can't work as-is, this must've been a pre-existing condition. I tell the customer's IT guy that I'm not touching that web shop, let the one who made it fix it and give the web dev guys' phone number.\n\nAfter couple of days I receive patches to the code. They arrive in a form of a JPG file, that's a screenshot of some Windows based text editor with some lines underlined and instructions to change this and that in the code. I groan and make the changes, the web shop now somewhat works as expected.\n\nCouple of weeks later I'm called into a conference call with the company owner, customer's IT guy and the customer's wife.

        "text": "So, here's a story that took place a couple days ago.\n\nBackstory: I work as a pseudo-IT in a small company dealing in office supplies. Basically \"make sure everything works\" kind of guy after the proper IT left. Anyway, we get to the story.\n\n'Twas a calm morning before shitmas. Or shitfest, as one prefers to call it. Nothing stood in our hero's path. The morning coffee was good, the sandwich he made back at home was tasty, and there was absolutely nothing to do so he could disappear in the hellish fires of Mt. Server Room to play some Quake 3 Arena. However, the yelling that came from the Land of Office Witches made him suspect that something went wrong.\n\n**DRAMATISATION**\n\n&gt;Office Witches: Oh, artixerix, where art thou, for my remote desktop cannot worketh!\n\n&gt;artixerix: Worry not, beautiful witches, for I come to help with my shining Cat-5e cable and glowing Thinkpad X220 of IT Services +5!\n\n**END OF DRAMATISATION**\n\nBecoming more serious, the hero headed out to the dreaded computer that one of Witches had problem remoting into. Interesting enough, network seemed fine. It was visible on the network, however it had no internet connection.\n\n&gt;Me: I shall pingeth this fsck-ed piece of equipment!\n\nOf course, outside of **FATAL ERROR** nothing else has become clear. Nmap? Turns out nothing. Could it be ethernet adapter? No, works after having IP assigned automatically instead of static *as it usually does*. With that knowledge, artixerix suspect that it must be the job of his arch-nemesis, **the previous IT guy**.\n\nThe previous IT was a kind of fellow that had wide knowledge in the arcanes of IT, but he shareth that with none. He conjured a network from ground up, but left no magic books behind for artixerix to understand how it worked. Armed with that (lack of) knowledge, artixerix headed out to a different part of the building to run Nmap there. Surprisingly enough, something turns up! Even more surprising, it's...completely different device than intitial PC, happily occupying the same IP that PC had assigned.\n\n&gt;artixerix: What kind of hellish spawns disrupt this calm network in such ways?!\n\nOf course, it all became clear soon.\n\nIt turns out that arch-nemesis, the \"format\" to artixerix's C:\\ drive, the \"sudo rm -rf \" to his \\home, the fsck to his perfectly working drive and filesystem...didn't know how to set up switches. \nBetter yet, from the office part of the building you can't see rest of the network (it's still on the same subnet), but you can see **EVERYTHING** if you plug into a switch that's in a different part of the building.\n\nAfter finding out that information from long lost scrolls of past, artixerix makes a round around the magical land to assign a static IP for EVERY device in the kingdom.\n\nThus, the day was saved. Princess found her prince, demon forces were sent to the shadow realm, and artixerix went back to Mt. Server Room to get his asskicked with K/D 3/10 in Quake 3 due to playing on TrackPoint(TM)-styled pointer.\n\nTL;DR previous IT is an idiot who can't set up switches, artixerix still has no idea how they work but finds a workaround.",

Until the phone rang. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**ME** - Only a Student getting the hang of things.\n\n**CU** - Confused User.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Standard Greeting\"\n\n&gt;**CU**: Our internet is down on the whole top floor! Please come out and fix the issue!!!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow this customerhas two floors in a \"Business apartment complex\" but is hosting their own IT equipment in their office. This also means that i know at least 20 users are without internet. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Okay, that's bad. Can i get you to go to the IT room and check if there is light in the humming boxes out there?\" \n\n(When i say IT room, image a broom closet where the janitors store stuff, then just a open rack closet attached to the wall. no doors)\n\n&gt;**CU**: \"Everything is dark! There are no blinking lights?! Is that normal?\"\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"No that's not normal. Is there a power cord that is not attached to the power strip?\"\n\n&gt;**CU**: \"No everything is attached!\"\n\nI spend a couple of more minutes trying to get the user to make sure that the cords are correctly seated in the power strip.\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Well, then we will have to send a guy onsite. We will be there in around 1 hour\"\n\n&gt;**CU**: \"Good! Just hurry!\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow getting to the customerdoes not take 1 hour, this was just to give myself some time. This was in a major city and taking public transportation was the quickest way to the customer. So i gathered some tools and went to catch the bus.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI arrive at the customer 30 minutes later, and walked up to the top floor where they were located.\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Hello CU, i am here and i'll just take a look at the issue.\"\n\n&gt;**CU**: \"Sure! Do you need anything? I'll just go grab a cup of coffee.\"\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"Naa, i'm good! thanks anyway.\"\n\nSo i go into the \"Server Room\" and plug the cord into the power strip again, and head for the kitchen.\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"So i will be heading out of here.\"\n\n&gt;**CU**: \"What do you mean? We cant work? did you forget some tools?\"\n\n&gt;**ME**: \"No? The power cord was not attached to the power strip as we talked about over the phone...\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI end up spending 30 minutes at the location teaching the user how to plug a power cord into a power strip, and give them some recommendations on how to prevent this from happening again. All in all a great day as i did not have to do phone support.\n\nEdit: costumer to customer. I have always had issues with that word...",

These are some short quotes from my years as the “computer kid” \n\nMe=Sonny\n\n\nStory 1\n\n&gt;Teacher: Sonny?\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah?\n\n&gt;Teacher: can you connect me to the internet on my phone please? \n\n&gt;Me: uhh. Sure? \n\n&gt;Me: *checks and phone is already connected.*\n\n&gt;Me: Miss, it’s already connected.\n\n&gt;Teacher: oh. I don’t think it is.\n\n&gt;Me: no, no. It is.

How do I make the video on the whole screen.\n\n&gt;Me: you click the rectangle in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.\n\n&gt;Teacher2: *starts scrolling down through the comments to get to the bottom* \n\n&gt;Me: (in my head) Jesus. What the hell.\n\n&gt;Me: no no. Go back to the video hover over it, in the bottom right hand corner of the video it should have rectangle. Click that. \n\nTeacher2: Ok, thanks.\n\n*end of video*\n\n&gt;Teacher2: Sonny, how do I go back to normal, not full screen?\n\n&gt;Me: click the same button.\n\n&gt;Teacher2: but it’s not there any more. It’s smaller now and looks different.\n\n&gt;Me: I know, click it anyway.\n\n&gt;Teacher2: oh yeah, thanks.\n\n\nStory 3\n\n\nWe were doing a virtual building tour of a mosque (we were in RE (religious education))\n\n&gt;Teacher2(yes the same person): how do I move around?\n\n&gt;Me: click the arrows on the screen.\n\n&gt;Teacher: *looks on keyboard for arrows. She can’t find them.* \n\n&gt;Me: no, on the screen. Below the picture of the mosque.\n\n&gt;Teacher2: *clicks the arrows and we finally get on with the work.*\n\n\nStory 4\n\n\nI can’t remember exactly what happened but I needed to help my IT teacher with a problem she was having on Microsoft word. It was embarrassing for her.\n\nStory 5\n(second hand)\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *clicks on a link and it brings up an advert.*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *clicks fake x button which sends her to another page*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *closes the page*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *clicks the fake x again*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *closes the page*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *clicks the fake x again*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *closes the page*\n\n&gt;Teacher3: *clicks the fake x again*\n\nThis goes on for a solid minute before a student stops laughing and clicks the button for her. \nMy friend called it a “recursive function with no exit condition.” And we all had a good laugh.\n\n\nStory 6\n\n&gt;Student: Sonny, do you play video games on a computer or a games console?\n\n&gt;Me: a PC.\n&gt;Student: what is a pc? Is it a type of computer.\n\n&gt;Me: *stares at her in disbelief*\n\n&gt;Me: it is a computer. \n\n&gt;Student: oh, I’m right then :)\n\nStory 7\n\nNot exactly tech support but thought I might as well share it anyway.\n\n&gt;Student2: Sonny. What exactly is an ai?\n\n&gt;Me: *explains what an ai is in a very nerdy way*\n\n&gt;Student2: *visible confusion* \n\n&gt;Me: Siri is an AI.\n\n&gt;Student2: oh, so it like talks to you through your phone.\n\n&gt;Me: it can... that’s not really what an ai is though. \n\nA few minutes pass\n\n&gt;Me talking about the dangers of ASI (artificial super intelligence)  \n\n\n&gt;Student2: couldn’t we just throw water on it?

(LU) Now, LU was on a call for which a customer was missing some TV channels.\n\n\nLU has all the tools at their disposal in order to check to see if the customer has the channels on their account. If we see that the customer has the channels on their account but cannot see them, that is when I come in and get that escalated. Here's how the call went with LU.\n\n\nMe: Tier 2, this is u/devdevo1919.\n\n\nLU: Hi. This is LU. I have a customer here who's missing some channels.\n\n\nMe: Have you checked Tool 1 to see if they're paying for it?\n\n\nLU: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Okay, show me where it says it in Tool 1. \n\n\nLU: It shows it here under *Package*.\n\n\n*LU was correct*\n\n\nMe: What about Tool 2?\n\n\n*This is the tool that matters. It shows us everything programmed onto their account.*\n\n\nLU: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Where?\n\n\nLU *stuttering*: Uh, well, it should be under *Package* like Tool 1.\n\n\nMe: Did you check under *Package*?\n\n\nLU: There's a lot of things listed there. \n\n\nMe: I know there is. You have to click on each of these and go through them all so we can be sure that the channels are not listed.\n\n\n*There was about 50 different selections.*\n\n\nLU: That's a long process, sir. Can I send a ticket or escalate to you?\n\n\nMe: No, LU. You need to make sure the customer does not have these channels. You know you need to do this. In the time spent with me you could've been checking the sub-packages under *Package* in Tool 2 to see if the customer has the channels.\n\n\nLU: But sir, the customer is frustrated.\n\n\nMe: You still need to verify. Is there anything else?\n\n\nLU: *sigh* No. *click*\n\n\nThe best part is LU called back almost as soon as they hung up with me and got the coworker sitting next to me who basically told them the exact same thing and if they called back about this and had not provided proof that they verified, an email would be sent to their manager.",

        "text": "So. This has been happening quite a bit recently.\n\nI get a ticket stating that the 2nd monitor for a Work at Home User is not working. It powers on, but the screen just stays black. I contact the User and start helping them. My Coworker (who sits right beside me) recognized the name and had been helping User with something else earlier that day regarding the new Desktop they just got. The user states they don't like working with Coworker because he has no patience (after helping this User, I had none either).\n\nSo I start trouble shooting. How is the 1st monitor connected? How is the 2nd monitor connected? What cables are they using? What type of computer are you using? What is the model of the monitor?\n\nA little background, my company got bought out two years ago and has been transitioning from HP to Dell computers. The HP Computers are EliteDesk 800 (G1 and G2), with two DP ports and a VGA port. They would be hooked up either VGA and DP or dual DP. We would also sometimes use VGA to DP adapters. The new computers are Dell 7040s, and they have two DP ports and one HDMI port.\n\nIt takes me 15 minutes to remote into the computer due to one issue or another and see that, yes, it only sees one monitor. No, it can't detect the 2nd monitor. \n\nSo I ask User, what cables are plugged into the monitor that is not working. User replies there are three cables: Power, a VGA to DP Adapter cable, and a miscellaneous one. Cool, some of the monitors have USB ports on the side, the third cable is probably a Type B cable to make those work. \n\nI tell User to unplug all the cables from the monitor that is not working, and then tell her to hook up the VGA. Still not working. I ask and receive confirmation multiple times that the cable is plugged into the computer, and that they are the only two cables plugged into the monitor.\n\n\nThis goes on for about fifteen minutes. Then the SO of the User gets on the line. After another ten minutes of having SO unplug everything, they ask me what they should do with the VGA end of the adapter cable.\n\nWhat?\n\n\nApparently, Coworker had sent User a DP cable so they can use dual monitors. User used the DP cable on Monitor 1, then used the old VGA cable to connect Monitor 1 to Monitor 2, then connected the DP Adapter to Monitor 2. However, there was no associated VGA port on the new Desktop, so it was just left dangling.  Every time I told them to plug in the Adapter, they had plugged it into the monitor, not the desktop. Every time I told them to plug in the VGA cable, it was the cable connecting Monitor 1 to Monitor 2.\n\nUsing very simple language, I had them disconnect all VGA cables. Then, had them plug the DP end of the cable into the Desktop and the VGA end into the 2nd monitor. \n\n\nVoila, it worked. \n\nTold User to just ignore the extra VGA cable, disconnected and closed the ticket. Looked at the phone: the call took 45 minutes and 23 seconds. \n\nWorst part is, this is the fourth or fifth ticket in the past few months that dealt with Work at Home user trying to setup dual monitors by connecting one monitor to the other. I've even had users plug both the VGA end and the DP Adapter end into the same monitor, and wonder why it doesn't work.\n\n**TLDR**: No, you can't use a VGA cable to bridge two monitors to get dual monitors.",

Walking the shopfloor the following conversation took place:\n\n&gt;**Me:** hey, so how's everything?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Worker:** everything's ok... but hey since you're here (they motion to the new system)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** looks fine, what's the problem?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Worker:** the pictures are nice, but the old system was better...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Worker:** we're having to keep count with pen and paper for chrissakes, and it doesn't tell us what materials to use, it's slowing us down.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** wait, you had a different system before?  I'm pretty sure this is the first version of the system that we launch. Did it look similar to this?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Worker:** oh no. It looked different. Access-something...\n\nNow, if you work with integrated systems, hearing \"Access\" can make the hairs of your neck stand up. It usually means someone developed their own database-of-things, with no integration to our other systems, no plan on who would maintain it, and stored locally... yeah\n\n&gt;**Me:** ok, that sounds bad. Do you know if anyone made a backup? \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Worker:** (stares)\n\nI then get a flashback. A few months ago:\n\n&gt;**Me:** hey, so we're ready to implement this new system. Could you guys purchase some tablets and tablet stands?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Tech:** no need. There's an old PC in here. We'll just wipe it and install this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** ok, sounds good.\n\nMy heart sunk with the realization of what had happened:  someone had developed an Access database, when products were scanned, it would keep count and show what packaging materials to use. Later, someone toured the area, saw the dusty PC and said \"there, we'll install the new system right there\"...\n\nLater, upstairs...\n\n&gt;**Me:** hey, I remember there was this guy downstairs... handy with computers... do you know where he is? was he moved to another building?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Admin:** yeah, he was a good guy, too bad he's no longer with the company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** oh\n\nEDIT: Lesson learned, keep backups. And communicate to the rest of the team of any mission-critical applications. ",

The power outage was only a brief blackout, so the UPSs should’ve been able to keep the servers and network stack online, while the servers shut down.\n\nBut we came back on the Monday of, and the servers had reports of a sudden power loss. We decided we’d go down and check the state of everything down in the server room - make sure the UPSs were connected correctly, comms cables into the server were good, and the actual battery status of the UPSs. Checking the batteries was the first thing we decided to do, and on the UPSs was a big button and a small button.\n\nI was down there checking things out with my colleague, who was the one squeezed inside the server room actually doing things. He’s like “so which button do I press?”\n\n“We just want to check status, so press the small one”\nThe big one was labelled ‘power’ and the small one was labelled ‘status’. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\nHim: “The big one?”\nMe: “No, the small on-“ \n\n*beeeeeeeep*\n\n*sounds of network switches turning off*\n\nMe: “you pressed the big one didn’t you?”\n\nHim: “yep...”\n\nMy colleague switches off the UPS that powers the equipment for our phone systems. The server room is located in the middle of the admin building. Admin staff start coming in: “we just lost all phones, what’s going on?”\n\nColleague: “oh, just an unexpected outage, it’ll be fixed in a few minutes.”\n\nAfter actually checking the UPS status, the batteries were only charging to 70% max, so we had them replaced.\n\nWhenever we go down to the server room now, I ask him if he wants to have another unexpected outage.\n",

Also on phone app, so I apologize if  wording, grammar, formatting and such isn't on par.\n\nAnyway..\n\nSo, a couple of years ago I worked for an authorized service provider where we handled a certain brand of expensive computers, tablets, phones, music devices and original accessories. Brand is not important. We primarily handled warranty, out of warranty (OOW) and claim cases sent from a big retailer, called BR, where I'm from.\n\nA colleague of mine, called 'M' got this small laptop in for a repair, which the retailer had sent in, because the customer had returned it claiming it wouldn't power on.\n\nSo M confirmed the issue, and like with all repairs he verified serial numbers on the BR invoice, BR repair order and our repair order. Everything checks out. Next step is to find out what's causing the issue, and make sure there is no physical damage, including damage done by liquids. He opens up the unit, and finds no liquids or damages, he however finds a several years old battery, power and input/output board, motherboard and SSD. Several screws are missing, as these old parts does not fit this new model.\n\nEveryone is surprised, as something like this has never happened before - and we've seen some odd and disgusting stuff..\n\nSo, policy is to document everything with pictures, logging everything with description of the condition of the unit. Next is to contact BR, to inform them of the situation. They don't understand, as they rarely do, and ask us how this has happened. M explains that he does not know, we can only inform them that this is how the unit was delivered to us. But it's pretty clear, that the customer has taking BR for a ride and screwing them over. \n\nNow what details happened next on BR's side of things are unknown, but we was informed to return the laptop to the store, and that they would take legal action towards the customer, for defrauding BR.\n\nEdit: minor clarifying details.",

This story takes place in my office with a coworker. \n\n\nCW = Coworker\n\n\nMe = well me\n\n\nNow, CW went to a client 2 buildings down to set up the voicemail recordings for a VoIP install we just did. One of the employees had an old iPod that looked like an Iphone 4. She wanted us to destroy it.\n\n\nNow, CW walked back to our office and (he told us this after the incident occurred) was excited to see the screen cracked the device to have a nice big hole in it. (We use a hydraulic press to put a 3 inch hole in our HDD's we destroy and recycle).\n\n\nSo, CW puts the iPod on the crusher and starts pumping away at it and (We viewed this on cameras after it occurred) was excited to see the screen cracked and get all messed up. Now what CW didn't think about was the battery...... you can see where this is going. \n\nNow our office has 2 sides, 1 side of the office is where 4 of us sit and handle the MSP side. The other side is where 1 tech sits and he handles residential repairs and small business support. This is where the crusher is.\n\nCW continues crushing until the battery was punctured. Smoke starts filling the office and a small fire occurs, CW and the tech on that side rush to get the iPod out of the cursher and put outside. The whole office was filled with the nasty stench that I cannot describe. It took about 4 hours to clear out the smell. Luckily there is a door between both sides of the office that we closed and it helped.\n\nWatching his face go from utter delight to complete OH SHIT was hilarious on the cameras. Once the instance was all said and done:\n\n&gt; ME = \"Now, CW, what did we learn today.\"\n\nEdit: FYI, CW is our office admin also. This only made it that much more hilarious.\n\nEdit2: Grammar",

(and i always find excuses not to do either of those). i wonder how long before she comes up to our office and asks, as i want to see my manager shouting at her that we're busy and her issue is not a priority. please let it be soon\n\nEDIT: I should mention that the docs she wants moved over are personal and as such ultra low priority. Her work is not affected as we have a centralised case management system. My ire is because she is making a fuss over these docs when she KNOWS our department is drowning in work.",

Occasionally though, we also had customers which took the matter into their own hands so we just ordered the components and sold them separately to the customer so he can build it himself.\n\nIn came a guy we sold some hardware 2-3 days ago and complains that he inserted everything and plugged everything in but the PC doesn't boot up. We tell him we're going to look at it and if we find something we'll call him and give him a quote. Sure enough, he left and we went to investigate.\n\nAfter having plugged everything in, we try to power on the machine. Nothing. Our first guess was that he forgot to attach the power pins of the case or the PSU wasn't properly wired up. While the wiring looked a little bit wild, it seemed to be properly connected so that was a dead end.\n\nWhile looking through the wiring, something else caught my eyes though. There were dents on the RAM sticks edge. 'lo and behold, it seems like the customer had trouble getting the RAM sticks in so he used a hammer to make it fit. \n\nYou know the little notch RAM sticks usually have so you can only insert them one way? Well, apparently the customer didn't and he made it fit the other way around and in that process, broke his mainboard too.\n\nIn the end we ordered a new mainboard and 2 new RAM sticks for the customer and installed it for him. He was more than happy to have it working finally. Still baffled though how you can manage to wire up a full PC and then be dumb af when it comes to the easy part.\n\nTL;DR: Customer was wondering why his PC didn't boot when he inserted his RAM the wrong way with a hammer.",

Their church had replaced their computers, and they wanted it formatted and set up for reuse.\n\nFrom the getgo, I set the expectation that this thing wouldn’t run all that great and that it may make more sense to just buy a new computer - they asserted that they wanted this one set up for their blind sibling whose braille keyboard compatibility stops at Windows 7. They’re upgrading from an i386.\n\nSo, we get it checked in and proceed to run diagnostics on all the main components. The hard disk had extensive sector damage, but the system also had a Samsung 860 evo 500GB SSD that seemed like it had barely been used at all, and was in perfect operating condition. Memory and processor both checked out fine.\n\nThe customer approves for us to go ahead and proceed with the work, reinstalling Windows 7. We get it all set up, along with drivers and updates. Once the integrated graphics drivers were in place, we noticed that, every now and then, the system would rapidly cycle back and forth between 800x600 and the resolution of the monitor we were using. This would go on for about 15 minutes, then  stop for seemingly no reason. After a good deal of troubleshooting and testing out different driver versions, we found the only workaround was to install a dedicated GPU.\n\nI call them up, explain the situation, and recommend that we get a basic graphics adapter installed - before I can even quote the part, they go on a tirade about how this computer worked perfectly before, that it must be our monitor, and they have no interest in dropping another dime into this computer.\n\nAfter explaining that we have tried other monitors and that no other systems exhibit these symptoms on the same monitor, they tell me they can just use a dongle to force the resolution. I said that I wasn’t aware of the existence of such a dongle, and they laughed at me over the phone saying they’d been in the industry for years and know what they are talking about.\n\nI tell them it’s their choice, and that we pretty much have things ready to go save for this one problem that sticks its head out every now and then.\n\nSuddenly, they have a change of heart - they accuse us of breaking their computer and say that they would not be paying for the work (we collected a deposit upfront. I was also ready to offer an older used radeon card at goodwill prices until the condescending attitude and baseless accusations came out)\n\nI politely inform them that, as they had approved the labor charges in writing, payment will be due in order for the equipment to be returned.\n\nThey decided they wanted to take the weekend to think about things, then dropped by unexpectedly to pay for the work and pick up the system. We showed them the work we had performed, and during that time the resolution issue didn’t reproduce itself.\n\nA day later, I got an email that they felt they had wasted their money and had dropped the computer off at a recyclery.\n\nThe total charge for labor was less than the used price of that SSD a month ago, before prices took a massive dip.",

Every now and then I get an old historical project come out of the wood work requiring my attention. A lot of my job involves saying no and giving sensible reasons for saying no I have to save money or find better ways to spend it.\n\nA lot of what we do is a nightmare because of the fact we have an external company who do anything infrastructure related. Basically if it's 2nd line/3rd line support, networking or server side we cannot do it no access. We spend a lot of our time doing 1st line, acting on requests and completing orders, which can cost a lot of money due to how support works via the company. What we do get involved in we do well and get very little moan and groans, never worked anywhere like this. So I get an email yesterday from a reasonably high up in the organisation at another site around 50 miles from us. He is almost the site lead and the sort of guy that if his laptop breaks in a meeting someone goes and looks at it immediately. This person is absolutely fuming because they've gone to a site and had to walk into the next room/building 30 seconds away to print.\n\nThis person is screaming that they need a portable printer to plug into their laptops and tablets, if we don't get this soon all hell plus fire and fury will break loose. He says they have been waiting over 9 months for this, sort yourselves out it's not a large cost we need this soon. After doing a big of background work and research I find out only a small amount of users are based in this temporary building which is on wifi, but good wifi no connection issues. Good coverage no other problems all seems good no support calls on this site for weeks.\n\nSo users can log in and work, email and access the content they need at good speed.\n\n  \nI do a bit more research find out they only print a couple of jobs a day most of their work is done via online systems and stored electronically. They don't need any secure or private printing solution. I then decide to look into cost of printer and it looks like it's going to be stupid money so by the time we buy the hardware, sort out getting it installed and actually get someone on site it's not a cost worth considering because....\n\nThere has been a project open for over a year to move this team into the adjacent building with desks complete with ethernet cabling and colour laser jet printer just for them! \n\nNeedless to say due to some broken communication angry person had no idea this was in the pipeline.",

I was one of six technicians at this small local repair shop. We sold laptops and desktops with lifetime labor attached to them\\- this is important to know as this particular customer bought a laptop from us\\- thus they became part of this \"lifetime labor\" warranty family.\n\n# THE STORY:\n\nAt the time, we had three locations at this company. I was working at Location B, the main branch will be Location A. Well a customer brought in a laptop he purchased from us to my location, he was a teenager, I would guess 16 at the time. He told me everything on his screen appeared to be \"inverted\" and at that time as well, Windows 10 was released for the public to download and upgrade for free.\n\nI take a look at the customer's laptop and ensure it wasn't the setting where everything appears inverted... sure enough, it was his LCD going bad as the invert was turned off in Windows, not to mention even in the BIOS\\- it was only white screen where on a normal monitor the laptop was plugged into, it would display just fine. So I tell the customer to drop his computer off with me, I needed to pull the model and revision number of the LCD screen from the laptop and I'd call him with a price once I figured it out.\n\n&gt;*$Customer:* Isn't this suppose to be lifetime warranty though?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Me Thinking: Oh boy\\- I'm about to have one of THOSE conversations* (There always seemed to be a convenient line of miscommunication when people break their stuff, and then mention lifetime warranties which obviously, is a shit business model that any sound person would agree with\\- but we do deal with customers after all!).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Me:* Well the labor side of it will be free, you will just pay the cost of the screen and that is it, installation is free though!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Customer:* Oh alright. Well in your database that is my number, but you'll want to call my mom for the repair quote.\n\nThe customer then leaves after giving me his mom's contact info. I proceed to pull the screen apart and grab the info needed, head on over to where we normally buy laptop parts at, and give them a quote within the hour. I let them know that everything was ready to pick up as well if they wanted to use the laptop in the mean time while waiting for the screen to come in. They were fine leaving it, and it remained in my location until the screen arrived the next week. Keep in mind I did not mess with the machine after grabbing the LCD model number during that time period, nor did I ask the customer for his password to his computer\\- which was also an online account (I realize there are ways around that, but considering it would have taken me more time and effort to bypass that over just calling and asking for the password, I just didn't bother) they wanted a screen repaired and nothing more? They got that, it was free labor either way.\n\nFast forward a week. The screen arrives, I replace the screen and they go home happy. That night, I was called by another fellow employee to see if I'd be willing to swap places with them for tomorrow with Location A. Location A is a lot more busier than Location B\\- to the point where I was the only employee in Location B actually, where A had three employees. I was also asked to swap for the day because I work faster and more efficiently than the other technicians\\- I could get a lot of tech work done vs the other employees, so I agreed to it.\n\nThe next day I go into Location A where the other employee went to location B. All is well until I get a phone call from the employee I swapped with in the middle of the work day...\n\n&gt;*$Employee:* Hey $Me, did you do anything with $Customer's laptop aside from replacing the LCD screen?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Me:* nope, it was an online account with a password I didn't have nor ask for, I didn't do anything else aside from replacing the screen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Employee:* Well... they said we deactivated their Microsoft Office and they want it back.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Me:* A LCD screen repair would not have deactivated their office. Also, we have had a few cases this week where Microsoft deactivated MS Office 2013 on some machines. I think it's due to an update or bug but they aren't the only ones with that issue is what I am getting at. Just tell them to sign back in with their email address and if it was previously linked, they won't have any issues\\- otherwise, we have no way of pulling that product key\\- hopefully they still have their product key lying around somewhere at their home, but past that\\- nothing I have done or can do about it now.\n\nAt the time, we didn't know of any programs that pulled Office 2013 keys. Sure we could do 2010 and prior, but anything newer and we were screwed. My coworker told me he handled it, but I guess she (Customer's mom remember!) was yelling at him for a good several minutes before finally disconnecting the phone before he could get another word in.\n\nWe then get a phone call at Location A. I mentioned Location A was the main \"branch\" right? Well if I didn't, you know now! Regardless, this is where the \"general manager\" was at. I use quotations on that because his title wasn't official as the CEO of the company didn't want to promote the guy, but relied on him to do EV\\-ER\\-Y\\-THING for the business. But turned out, the Customer called and wanted to speak with either the owner of the company or someone \"high up\".\n\n&gt;*$GM(General Manager):* **Company name**, this is $GM.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Customer:* You guys deactivated my son's Office! He can't do any school work now! The computer was fine before your tech touched it! **\\*Insert more ranting here\\- you know, typical pissed\\-off\\-customer\\-ranting\\***.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$GM:* Well a screen repair wouldn't have done that. And the laptop was locked, my tech didn't call or ask for a password, there is no way a screen repair would have caused this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*$Customer:* That makes no sense! Office was working before he brought the computer into your company! Now it doesn't even work! We expect a free copy of Office or for it to be re\\-activated and put back on!\n\nGM basically tells them that they need the product key or to try signing in with an email account ^((Since 2013 it was not required to sign in, this was a 50/50 chance that this would work).) But there is no logical reason I was responsible for that, not to mention the previous cases we had of deactivated 2013 Offices that week which was fixed by simply signing in again or putting in your product key again. Plus he was not the type of manager to give entitled or angry customers free stuff away, so he basically told them where to go shove it, and left it at that. She was likely lashing out because they probably did not have the product key on hand, threw it away, etc\\- realized they couldn't reactivate\\- so tried to get another copy for free.\n\n# The Outcome:\n\nThe customer ended up posting a google review on all three of our locations, rating us one star and mentioning the repair and how we \"deactivated\" her son's office and how he can't do school work now without spending $170 on a new copy of Office, and etc... typical petty review stuff. She also posted on Yelp and Facebook about our company with the same copy/paste review. She called demanding to speak to the owner of the company\\- who was never in anyway\\- seeing if he would make things right, and finally gave up after several days of not being able to reach him (The dude legit, never was at any of our locations. We employees have a hard enough time getting a hold of him and we were there 9 hours a day!). She also wrote an email to each of our publicly listed email addresses (Example: [GrowingTech@CompanyName.com](mailto:GrowingTech@CompanyName.com)) saying how terrible our service was, how she will never buy anything from us again, nor go into our locations ever again, expecting that we make this right, etc.. She even filed a complaint on the BBB site and mentioned taking us to a small claims court... that never went through but the dedication to get that Office 2013 was impressive.\n\nMoral of the story\\- a hardware repair like replacing your screen, will not impact your software that dramatically. Also, Office 365 is free for those of you with a .EDU email address! We were actually trying to explain that to her, but she was being so rude and demanding ^((I watered this down a lot compared to the actual story\\- but if you combine this sub reddit with) r/TailsFromRetail ^(typical customer complaints and whatnot\\- you get the idea of what we were dealing with)) that we just decided to shut our mouths about it.\n\n**TL;DR: Replaced the screen of a laptop, customer's MS Office is deactivated due to an update or glitch at the time, they wreaked havoc on the company trying to get a free replacement even though we tried to tell them how to reactivate it.**",

        "text": "So, I work for an MSP and handle sites from mum's accounting computer upstairs all the way up to multi nationals. Needless to say, I have seen things.\n\nToday, I got a call from one of the sites I have a love hate relationship with. Like, they are lovely people, wonderful to talk to, just not the brightest.\n\nAnyways, client calls to tell me they can't login to a portal hosted at their main site (site to site VPN) because the server is down. I'm a little baffled because the other site has around 30 seats and no one has called yet. Not to mention, this staff member knows the servers are down and my team doesn't. So I suss it out. Sure enough, the entire site hosting the servers is down.\n\nSo, needless to say, ticket becomes critical. I call the other site:\n\nMe: Hey, uh... Your internet isn't working is it?\n\nReception: Nope, it has been down all morning.\n\nMe: Uh, okay, can you put me through to soandso?\n\n*puts me through*\n\n...\n\n*Hi, you've reached the voicemail of... *\n\n*hang up *\n\nAt this point I'm pretty furious \n\n*my phone rings*\n\nIt's soandso.\n\nJust a little background on soandso, this user once called asking for assistance adding a picture into a word document. That's the type of illiteracy we are dealing with here. When things go wrong, you assume it's this user. \n\nMe: Hey, soandso! Just wanted to find out what was happening with the internet.\n\nSoandso: oh, the phones were kind of crackly when I came in this morning so I restarted every device in the server room except the server.\n\n**die a little inside**\n\nMe: Did one of my colleagues tell you to do that? \n\nSoandso: uh, no\n\n**obviously**\n\nMe: Okay, so you just reatarted a bunch of things hoping one was the router? \n\nSoandso: Yes... \n\n**For the love of god, why?! Don't touch the things. Never touch the things! **\n\nMe: Okay, so next time, please give us a call, some of those devices should never be restarted unless there is a really good reason. \n\n**No, seriously, if you do that again I'll drop a UPS on your car from the roof of the building**\n\nSoandso: no worries. While I have got you, the shared drives have been kind of slow and they have red crosses on them. Also, my Emails say trying to connect! \n\n**Seriously? No one can do anything and you want to have a chat about this now?! **\n\nMe: That's because you restarted a core switch. Look, I need to give your ISP a call and let them know what you have done so they can rectify this. I'll give you a call back. \n\nSoandso: okay, b*hang up on her*\n\nCall the ISP and explain everything and they work their magic.\n\nGet the NTU and router restarted by a staff member and check the VPN is working again. \n\nI called back the original user with the issue and explained that everything was working again. They asked why everything was down so I told them. They then told me that soandso had called them to tell them the server was down and not to call us because it would be working again soon. \n\nBefore closing the ticket, I added their boss as a ticket contact so he would get a transcript of the stupidity. All said and done, there was 4 hours where no one could get any work done. 40 seats across all sites, times four hours, times average pay rate of 30 per hour - $4800 lost in wages alone that morning. \n\nTl;dr: illiterate staff member unplugged everything in the rack then told everyone it was a problem with the server when nothing came back up and tried their hardest to have no one call IT support so we wouldn't find out and they wouldn't get in trouble.

I can see the frustration in his mouse clicks as his Yanni Live concert on Spotify was being so rudely interrupted. I had him go through the standard troubleshooting techniques of removing all peripheral devices to see if that cleared up the issue....no dice. After going through all this for about 20 minutes and finally resorting to asking him to reboot, he says...\n\n\"I forgot I had my wireless mouse in my backpack, the volume stays on now!\"\n\n\\*facepalm\\*\n\nLive on Yanni, Live on!",

        "text": "Howdy lads, never thought I'd have a reason to post here again. I worked tech support for a couple years, but have since moved to security. I work in a public library and today I've been managing an ongoing issue for about three hours.\n\nSo start of my shift, come in to check and all is clear. Nice, peaceful day, but somewhere in the back of my mind was a warning signal that I wouldn't have any rest. Almost immediately, I get approached by a staff member saying that a patron needed help with Excel. Fun times, I'm the only computer savvy one here.\n\nI approach and offer my greeting, the patron tells me that he needs help making delivery labels for a printing company to print out onto stickers. While explaining, he's clicking the most nonsensical options on Excel to try and make the cells the way he wants, almost constantly going on with a stream of \"Oh no...oh gods...oh damn...what do I do here...\"\n\nThe patron was trying to take a specific template meant for word and get it onto excel. It took a while to convince him he was on the wrong program, as I was constantly met with, \"I've been doing this for x years, I do it every year, it's this way.\" Eventually, I convince him to let me borrow an example sheet he had and snuck into the back to work it out on my own. \n\nNeeds Avery Template 5160, simple enough. Head to Avery, download the correct template, open it in word. Voila. Show this to the patron and...\"No, no, no, this has to be in excel. How else will I get cells in it?\" After a time, I convince him to let me use his computer, pull it up in word with the cells already in the template, and am met with the typical disgruntled nature of someone proven wrong and knows they're wrong.\n\nDay saved, back to security. \n\nNot even three minutes pass before I'm caught by him again. He needs 12 pages of this template so he can get everything he needs. Okay...so I suggest finishing a page, opening a new version of the template. No go, he has to have it all on one document. \n\nIn my experience, it is always the biggest pain in the world to try and get an external template to actually copy into new pages in the same word document. I snuck back to my station again and spent about 20 minutes trying to work this out in a quick and easy way. Unfortunately, I couldn't, nor could google aid me. This whole time I'm being bothered that he has to get it done fast.\n\nNow here, I will admit, I forgot about Labels. It took me a lot of searching to find the Mailings \\&gt; Labels options and what do you know, Avery 5160 is in Word as an internal template. Problem solved! Except that the patron is bothered by the fact it looks slightly different and constantly tries to keep opening the external version instead. Eventually, I convince him this is exactly what he needs, show him the title, explain how to make new pages. This doesn't work so I just make the pages for him.\n\nFinally, back to security, only an hour in!\n\n...But that would be too easy wouldn't it. From here on out, over the course of the next hour, I was stopped for the most basic questions.\n\n\"How do I put a break here? Oh...press enter? So the space bar...no? Enter? So backspace...no? Oooh, enter.\"\n\n\"How do I copy and paste?\" This one took ages. Again and again I would explain, for him to highlight the text. Again and again he would highlight it, left click, highlight it, right click outside the page entirely, highlight it, open menu, click out of the box. Finally, we got copying down, only for him to be more confused by paste.\n\nI genuinely believe someone could solve Einstein's Field Equations more easily than this man could work out copy/paste. The most complicated philosophical question poses less intellectual work than copy/paste. \n\nEventually, he kind of somewhat gets it. But it does not end. Every single time he has to change to a new label, usually just meaning he has to change the very last line, he has to come and ask about copy/paste again. I showed him the menu, I showed him keyboard shortcuts, I tried everything over the past two hours to make it make sense to him. It was genuinely a relief for him to ask me how to save a document to his flash drive, as it meant not explaining more about copy/paste.\n\nI'll not ever think poorly of an older man for not understanding computers, but even in the course of typing this out, I've been interrupted four times just about copy/paste. This may be the one tech situation to make me slam my head into the desk the most, and I've worked for Frontier before.\n\nBest of luck to your cases from now on, lads. I wish you the best of luck with getting simple problems, delightful customers, and easy\\-going bosses. \n\nI'm off to go explain copy/paste again.",

Calling our back office to get someone to fix it won't work because they don't want to have to pay someone to come out if there's nothing wrong with it, even though this machine is famous for breaking down, and just wants to monitor it. Trying to fight them on getting a tech dispatched has really shortened my fuse right off the bat today.\n\nThen *she* calls. She will be BOL for bitchy old lady.\n\nSo, I'm waiting for customers to come in when the phone rings. I pick it up.\n\nMe: hello welcome to \\[store\\] this is theeverymaam speaking.

I did just pick up the phone but there was no answer so I hung up.\n\nBOL: Well I was speaking to you but you were ignoring me.\n\nMe: Like I said I couldn't hear you\\-\n\nBOL: Well I could hear you and I could hear voices in the background.\n\nMe: Yes, I think there was something wrong with the connection then, but how can I help you? (She yelled at me multiple times throughout the entire phone call that she's still there so don't hang up, but I'll spare you)\n\nBOL: I was just in there a little while ago and some guy helped me and told me to call a number but I can't get through.\n\nMe: well what seems to be the problem?\n\nBOL: I'm trying to get on the computer but I can't. It won't let me. I've tried and it won't let me get in. I put in my password and everything but its stopping me for some reason.\n\nMe: Okay so you can get on your computer just fine but need to get onto your account?\n\nBOL: Yes.\n\nMe: Okay, can you give me your account number or social so I can pull you up?\n\nShe proceeds to give me her husband's social (ugh) but as long as they are linked I should be able to find her. I have her give me the last four of hers to verify who she is. Neither of them have an online account. But they have several business with us. I ask her if it's under there and she has no clue (of course because why would that be useful to know) and she just says that it's the one that has all of the accounts pull up (obviously, im not stupid) so que me searching through all of their businesses to find their online account. She tells at me because she hears voices in the background and I have to explain that my coworkers are waiting on people (which is also really annoying and happens way too often).\n\nI find it and she has indeed been locked out. Easy fix though, as we just reset the password. Unfortunately this time it wants me to either email or text a temporary one to her, rather than set it to the last four of the ssn or tin. But, no big deal... for normal people.\n\nMe: Okay, I need to send you the temporary password so i can email or have it texted to you.\n\nBOL: Oh, i have messenger so just messenger it to me.\n\nYes, she did say \"messenger it to me.\" That was not a typo.\n\nMe: Okay, when you say messenger, do you mean text or email?\n\nBOL: messenger on my phone.\n\nInner me: I'm about ready to hang up on you again.\n\nMe: okay, I'll have it text you then.\n\nShe makes me stay on the phone with her while she's putting the password in.\n\nBOL: It didn't work. I put it in... the username but it says username or password incorrect. I'm using nnn.\n\nMe: (thinking she's putting the wrong username in) Okay, well that's not the username we have for you. We have it as bbb (it's about 20 numbers long btw)\n\nBOL: oh, yes, thats what I have. (Proceeds to repeat the whole user id) but when I put in nnn it says wrong.\n\nMe: Okay, so you're putting that number in the password then?\n\nBOL: yes, its nnn.\n\nInner me: please don't tell me you're goddamn password lady.

What is your user name? \n\n$Bob : It is Username123\n\nI find his account on the server and change the password.\n\n$Me : Okay here is your new password, Password123 with first upper case letter. \n\nHe then starts to try to log in on his laptop several times, but is not able to log on. \n\n$Me : Did you write the first letter as upper case? \n\n$Bob : Yes, but it does not work with my password! I put it in as the username. \n\nMy hand that is about to reach for a pen on my desk freezes. I feel the fabric of cosmos falling apart around me. I slowly turn to him and say. \n\n$Me : Password123 is your new password, not username. \n\n$Bob : Ah, Ok\n\nIt slowly downs on him this and by this point i am looking forward to him leavi-\n\n$Bob : Hey, what is my username!\n\nHoly Lord Turing grant me wisdom for this encounter. Because this guy just told me his account name 5 min ago!\n\nHow can he forget his username he just told me! I just stare at him and say\n\n$Me : You just told me your username!\n\nI see it dawns on him and and the light bulb turns on\n\n$Bob : Ah, that thing. I don't know what it is.\n\nAt this I have developed a twitch in my lower left eyelid. I turn back to the surver and check his username in AD.\n\nAfter finding it I lean on over the counter and literally hiss in his face the username while giving him the coldest look I have.\n\n$Me : It isssss Ussssername123\n\n(According to my friends that work in the bank or as a lawyer I have a frightening glare) \n\nHe pales and runs out the door screaming that I am the devil and the snake.

        "text": "Sup. I do, among other things, on site service for a brand of RFID security gates used by libraries, and the self check-out kiosks that go with them.\n\nI got a call at the end of March in a rural town that was part of a very small network of libraries. They have one self check-out computer. The monitor no longer displays anything. I plug in an adjacent monitor from one of the computers there for internet browsing, and I see the output just fine. The broken monitor has a touchscreen builtin, so this monitor I grabbed for testing can't take its place, but at least I know what is going on.\n\nI figure this will be easy. All it needs is a new monitor. How much trouble could this be? \n\nI ask one of my leads which monitor I'm looking to order, since this kiosk is so old I don't have any documentation on it. He gives me a number, and I order it. About 20 techs are waiting for this part, and have been for a while. After a couple of weeks of waiting, I find out he misunderstood which kiosk I'm ordering for, and that the part I ordered is a all in one PC, not just a monitor. I don't even want to try and reimage a new machine, since I just need a monitor. \n\nTurns out, that particular touchscreen/monitor combo doesn't have a part number in my parts order system. I have a similar one that usually goes with a different unit. So I order it. It so happens that the monitor I ordered doesn't fit on the same stand, and only takes DVI in, while the computer only outputs on VGA. After ordering the stand that goes with the new monitor we found out that the depot had a little problem where they mixed up two sizes of stand, requiring me to reorder the stand.\n\nOrdering the adapter came with it's own challenges. Searching for DVI adapter gives me about 30 different items, with varying codes, and descriptions that are all a little more vague than I'd like. I more or less pick one at random and hope for the best. I also order a DVI cable. Someone in logistics calls me up:\n\n&gt; $logistics: Hey, this adapter you ordered is about a couple hundred bucks. I can get another brand for a lot cheaper, would that be alright?\n\n&gt; $me: It cost how much? Get whatever brand you want, doesn't matter to me and that price is rediculous.\n\nAnd I get a call from a different logistics guy:\n\n&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: Hey, can you order a cable coded for library calls?\n\n&gt; $me: No, they don't have their own special part number for video cables.\n\n&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: Well, you need to stick to parts labeled for libraries. Buy a cable at a store on your way their, add the part to the ticket, and then submit the form for reimbursement.\n\n&gt; $me: The hell?\n\n&gt; $otherlogisticsguy: I know, I don't make the rules.\n\nRemember how this all started at end of March? I didn't get everything together until last Friday, so the kiosk hasn't been usable for the past two months.\n\nI get to the library, thinking that I will finally get this call out of my queue. After putting the monitor on its stand and arranging some cabling, I turn it on and am greeted by a no video input error. Hell. Examination of the DVI to VGA adapter I ordered showed a couple of oddities. First, the DVI side is labeled input, and the VGA side is labeled output. I didn't know these came in one way varieties. Second, the adapter requires a 5V power supply. It was not supplied with a 5V power supply. Why would it need a power supply? Why is it so hard to order a simple, common PC part?\n\nCurrently my hope is that the Best Buy in the town between me and the library has an adapter that will work. I'll just buy it on my own, and put it down as a parking expense on my time sheet, since I little interest in filling out a ticket to get reimbursed in a month for a small sum.",

I won't try and go through any dialog just the story.\n\n**Backstory:** About two, two and a half year back a client was interested in a video presentation and conferencing setup for their business, they would have it setup at a couple remote offices in conference rooms and they could then have company wide meetings, training, conferences both internally and externally.\n\n\\-\\-\n\nSo I'm not a video engineer by any means, I work on the interconnection side of the house and because this involved some networking components as well as a possible SIP server I was involved in it from that aspect.\n\nCustomer had outlined the basics for us some of the info above, they would also be the ones purchasing the solution, however a third\\-party would be paying, I'm guessing some type of grant or another. With this we setup and came up with a solution based on the Polycom cloud services as it met every requirement, we also from the hardware side put together all the components for the solution(Projectors, screens, mic/speakers, etc.). At this point I'm not sure what happened, but either way the customer didn't like the cloud and asked for a pure hardware solution.\n\nWith this in mind we put together a full on projection system connected to Polycom VBP(Video Border Proxy). They signed off on it and made the purchase. Because some of the components we don't house on site took a couple weeks to gather up and get ready for, this however it where I got involved and things went awry.\n\nWe alerted the customer everything was ready for installs. Because I don't do sales it hadn't been discussed with us about installs, so naturally we call over and talk to the PM to find out no install was quoted, they didn't seem to know why and we scheduled a conference call.\n\nCustomer proceeds to explain it wasn't part of the budget and they were just purchasing for their internal IT to configure and setup. Explaining the complications behind this and that if their IT were to call us we couldn't help them beyond  basic troubleshooting. They signed off said to deliver on x date and see friendly tech who they would alert.\n\nSo we as a company hire out delivery to someone else as we don't have the trucks, they show up on the proposed date we load everything in and set them along their way.\n\nAbout threeish hours later we get a call from the delivery driver telling us they can't deliver it to the friendly tech as they hadn't ordered anything, this being just shy of about $50,000 in gear they refused the delivery. We became back involved and called the tech to find out the company hadn't bothered to tell them about getting this new system and they saw a different company name listed(this being the people paying) they couldn't accept it. At this point we told the driver to stay put and we would get it straight.\n\nA half\\-day later the driver is told to bring all the gear back to us.\n\nOver the pursuing six or so weeks we ended up having to requote out all the config, setup, implementation and charging for re\\-delivery all because no one bothered to let IT know it would be coming nor did they have all the expertise needed for setup and install. This ended up being about a $8,000 charge to them.\n\n**TL;DR:** Company purchases a video solution and doesn't bother to relay information to IT nor find out if they have all the right people to install and configure.",

        "text": "So I used to work as a trainee at my school (kinda still do work there, not as trainee tho), we were a fairly sizeable school so had equally sized infrastructure to boot. At the time, our core infrastructure consisted of 1 server that performed core roles like AD, user storage, and main network functions (like DHCP and the internet proxy) - with 2 other servers that performed misc services and any custom programs we needed to host.\n\nBecause of the size of the school, the core server actually had dual gigabit NICs. But when the server was initially installed, no pairing configuration was set on the cards - so they weren't operating in failover, round robin, teaming. They were just two independent cards. For a long time, we just kinda let it slide because we never had any issues with network performance (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).\n\nEventually, it got to the point where we were starting to hit capacity on the single gigabit NIC, as the school grew. We knew the server had a second NIC installed, so we planned for some configuration changes in the last week of term.\n\nI am **SO** glad we planned to do it then.\n\nWhen we went to go down and enable teaming so we could get the full fat 2gbps, the cards' drivers were complaining saying they needed the latest drivers to enable teaming. No big deal, just download the latest drivers and update... right?\n\nWe started the driver installer. It started uninstalling the old drivers so it could install the new ones, but then it said to finish uninstalling the old drivers it needed to restart. Yeah, ok, lets restart then.\n\nOne small problem (that we didn't realise at the time).\nIf the network drivers are going to be uninstalled on restart, the system will have no network when it comes back online again. To login to the server, we needed the AD server as there was no local login (due to security policies). The server was the AD server though. \n\nSo now we had no AD. No internet proxy either. Luckily, one of the other slave servers was setup as a DHCP failover, so at least the local network kept operating.\n\nWhich still wasn't much use, because with no AD no one could authenticate with any of our AD driven services (which most were). And aside from that, no one could use the internet, teachers and students couldn't access their files, printing wasn't working. Pretty much the entire network was brought down.\n\nTo try and fix the issue, we had to somehow manage to get a local account onto the machine, use said local account to refresh the network drivers, and remove the local account and login with AD again. This was way too complex for our pay levels, so the head IT guy contacted the regional tech guy (who has more clearance and experience than us to fix these things), who in turn had to contact the server manufacturer directly to be able get this custom software thingy they had to use to flash a local account without breaking any of the files on the server. We never really got told the direct process of how the solution worked, but it took them the entire last week to get the network back up.\n\nThe school had no network for an **entire week**. This is why planning ~~outages~~ changes is important.\n",

I work for a medium sized healthcare company that specializes in taking care of people at their own homes. I work in the home office, so we have a decent number of employees here as well as the upper leadership like CEO, board members, etc. \n\nThe actual tale starts with a girl named Jane (not her actual name, of course!). She comes into my office and starts to tell me about how strange her computer is acting. Apparently, every time she opened outlook it would scroll infinitely, she couldn't get any other programs to open, things were typing strange, just really anomalous behaviour. She'd had the CEO come and take a look as well as one of our nursing co-workers.\n\nThey all agreed it was acting strange and to come get me. So, I take a look over her computer. The problem is instantly apparent once she showed me what was happening. When she hit the windows symbol, for example, spaces would be created over and over.\n\nIt turns out, she'd laid a clipboard down on her desk, right on her space key. Once the clipboard was removed, the computer started working fine again.\n\nGotta love a happy ending.",

All in all this is about a 100 \\- 110 hour job for the work requirements between setup, implementation, conversion, design, engineer and on\\-site support. This has bounced back and forth multiple times over the years, paused, stopped, re\\-quoted, etc.\n\nThis one particular day after some long and lengthy discussion on when this would be ready to begin the scope of work it went a bit sideways.\n\nAt the beginning our conversations we had gone over Office 365 and it's requirements versus an on\\-prem solution requiring varying licensing, hardware and software purchases. To our surprise they went with an on\\-prem solution, later we would find out that during our discussions on O365, they kept referring to the Office suite of products and didn't seem to understand the Sharepoint part of it.\n\nBecause of their business and size they were offered really aggressive pricing from us, but Microsoft had even better purchasing power, however they decided to spend a couple ten\\-thousand with us from licensing, software and hardware.\n\nThen one day this happened. We get a call saying we need another meeting, after already signing everything.\n\n* **ME = Well Me**\n* **Customer = Well Customer of course**\n\n&gt;Customer \\- So we need to talk about the Sharepoint pricing and why you are charging x ten\\-thousand dollars for software and hardware  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me \\- We offered pricing on the base software, all needed licensing and hardware needed to run the Sharepoint instance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Customer \\- We are interested in other products now rather than just Sharepoint\n\nAt this point I go about explaining the on\\-prem versus the Office 356 with Sharepoint options, yet again. Giving them examples of our pricing vs Microsoft. It was as this point we also learned they had not involved their IT department until after everything was decided upon. Also learning their internal IT department had explained better pricing via Microsoft vs us and seemed to not believed or maybe understood exactly what O365 with Sharepoint was.\n\nAs such I confirmed what their IT department told them and proceeded to save them oh about a couple ten\\-thousand dollars in the process.\n\n**TL;DR**: Company made technical decisions outside of their IT department with limited understanding of what they needed and were buying.\n\nEDIT: Spelling and format..",

My dad owned a consulting business at the time. I was in my early teens and he took me along most afternoons to teach me computers. We had a client that was keen on keeping older equipment around. They kept their desktops on the floor in a ground\\-level office building. To accessorize, they had these old CRT monitors from maybe \\~1996 when they first moved in.\n\nA hurricane pays us a visit, flooding most of the area. 1 to 3 feet of water on the roads. Every desktop in the building is submerged in at least a foot of water. Completely non\\-salvageable. My dad, as the “IT guy,” gets called into the building a few days later to meet with an insurance adjuster. The office is still somewhat flooded and without power. However, management NEEDS their employees up and running as soon as possible. The adjuster meets my dad and begins taking inventory. It should be noted that many of the CRTs were fine. They were plugged into surge protectors and, oddly, didn't take any water damage. I think they lost 2 or 3.\n\nMy dad doesn't give a f\\*\\*\\*. He told me he got caught piling some CRTs onto the still flooded office floor to make it look like they were damaged in the flood. Thing is, the adjuster puts them in as non\\-salvageable anyway. Being as it is my dad telling me this story, I assume he exaggerated to keep me entertained.\n\nFast forward two weeks: the carpets are being professionally dried, the cubicles are almost repaired, and we have twenty\\-something boxes of new PCs and monitors to go along with them. I don't know and I don't want to know. \n\nEpilogue: In case anyone is concerned, the office's servers were all on top of a desk in a small data closet. They were unharmed. The “only” data lost was whatever the users had saved locally. Music (when Limewire was still a thing), desktop files, pictures, documents… It was a s\\*\\*\\*show, in as far as all the idiots using company property to download music were now without their precious Santana. The users who whinged were met with exactly the type of stare you'd expect from a man who has, for the past two weeks, been screamed at by management about getting desktops back online. They really got the hang of “saving to the server” after that. Yeah. Right.",

        "text": "Good afternoon all. Our mobile app has about 7 million users and I’m on a team that handles customer inquiries. The app can be downloaded for free to use some features, but the main feature requires digital credits. Can’t say more or it will be a giveaway for the app.\nThis one came in direct from a web form on our company website today.\n\nIW will be Idiot Wife. Me will be me.\n\n\nIW: said this was free and you charged me $30\n\nMe: hey IW, thanks for contacting us! We see that there is no account with the email you provided. While the mobile app is free to download from the Google Play Store, it does cost (digital currency) to use the (main feature of the) app. The charges will appear like X on the billing statement\n\nIW: I never said I had an account!!! My husband was told at the bar that this app was free and then ya’ll charged his card $30!! My husbands name is X and I expect a refund within 24 hours! This is absolutely ridiculous!! I have been waiting for a refund for a month!!\n\nMe: The app is free to download, but it is not free to (use main feature). This is the first message we have received from (email).\nWe see in the screenshot you have sent that there is a $20 and $10 purchase. The payment information was entered manually into the app and the “purchase credits” button was tapped. \nOnce for a $20 package and once for a $10 package. \nThere is also a screen after that which confirms the purchase. \n\nIn order to assist, we would need to be contacted directly from the email associated with the account or the mobile app account itself. We do not have any information for the account at this time.\n\nIW: he deleted your stupid app after ya’ll charged us $30! If I don’t have my money back in 24 hours I’m going to the BBB since you obvious can’t help and they can. Have a nice day.\n\nMe: the app is not free to use. No representative from (company) has claimed otherwise. In order for us to locate the account, we would need the email address associated with the account. We would be able to issue a refund for (digital currency) that has not yet been used, but we could not issue a refund for currency that has already been used. \n\n\nIW: go f*** yourself the BBB will give me what I need\n\n\n\n\nSo looking forward to speaking with legal about this BBB claim for an account which hasn’t even been identified. The BBB cannot issue the money back, lol.\n\nSorry the drunk guy at the bar lied to your husband, and then your husband input the payment info manually and made 2 purchases. Did he think it was a fake receipt and fake digital wallet? The field to enter the payment info was fake, as well as the “CONFIRM PURCHASE” pop up...?\nGuarantee that if we find the account all the digital currency has been used.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Right before I was supposed to go on lunch a young woman walked into my shop asking if we could see why she can’t use the ports on her computer. According to her whenever she plugs something in she has to do it multiple times then giggle the cord before it works and it’s become so much of a hassle she just wants to get it fixed. \n\nSo I get called in to check out her laptop and I boot it up and try to plug a test cable into it. That’s when I felt a patch of rough and scratched metal along the side of her computer. I turn it to the side and look to see whatever that was and I’m almost horrified. \n\nAll of the ports are scratched and bent. Like someone was trying to force a usb cable in repeatedly like they were stabbing it instead of turning it around.  Upon closer look 2/3 USB ports are actually bent out of shape. \n\nI walk to the front to talk with the lady and she tells me that she gets “the way the cord is supposed to be in wrong sometimes”. I ask if she is trying to force it in and she says that she sometimes does but then realizes it’s the wrong way and flips it around. \n\nI then ask if she has any problems when she tried to transfer files onto a usb stick and she says sometimes stuff doesn’t copy over when she thought it did. \n\nI’m on my lunch break right now but I can already tell this is going to take up the rest of my shift.  \n\nEdit: I epoxied a hub to the least broken port and attached it to the case. It’s only a temporary fix but she wanted to keep the computer even after it was filled with corrupted files from her pulling the usb out while transferring data. ",

        "text": "*This happened about 45 minutes ago*\n\nIn the world of US Commercial Aviation, we find ourselves fully immersed in the security culture that’s become so prevalent these days.  Nobody wants to see another hijacking, another bomb, another crash, another 9/11, so we more or less accept the heightened security at work.  Of course, this security requires some additional training on the part of the police and TSA and their canine companions are just as subject to that training.\n\nThere are several variety of canine we see wandering our hangars alongside their handlers on training missions, but most common are the Drug and Bomb dogs.  I really don’t know the number of times I’ve stepped onto a plane to discover a drug dog happily snuffling away beneath our cargo holding equipment, looking for a sample of the good Columbian nose candy.  \n\nToday was no different—a K9 team was working the parts storage area behind my current cubefarm, to which we paid little attention.  It’s a fairly secure, low-distraction environment, perfect for training a dog, so it made sense they were up here.  As a result, I didn’t even register them working among the parts racks as I walked by, headed to the restroom in the same area.  \n\nStanding at the sink a minute later, I happened to look over at the hand-towel dispensers and I noticed two plastic ammo cans with a bag of latex gloves perched atop the dispensers.  Curious and thinking from the gloves we must have gotten some new restroom first aid kit, I grabbed one of the boxes, opened it up and glanced inside.  I was greeted by several long, olive drab blocks on which was emblazoned:\n\n###CHARGE, DEMOLITION M112\n\nSomewhere down low and directly behind me a black hole opened up and I could feel my entire body getting sucked into the void. I was holding in my hand a block of C4, in the wild.  \n\nIt took a moment to realize there was a “PROPERTY OF TSA” label on the packaging, and as I slowly, carefully closed the ammo box, I noticed the “SOMEWHERESVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT” label discretely affixed to the top of the box.  \n\nI then replaced it in its home and proceeded to scrub my hands pretty hard.  Exiting the restroom, I ran into one of the officers.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “..You guys just scared the daylights outta me.”\n\n&gt;**Officer** “Oh?  Did you find something?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Yeah, you could say that.  And after I saw what was inside, I washed my hands, a lot.”\n\n&gt;**Officer**  *laughing* “You didn’t take anything did you?”  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Nope!  I don’t need *any* of that in my life!”\n\nA few minutes later, exercise concluded, the K9 handler introduced us to the dog, a very friendly and beautiful German Shorthair, and we all had a laugh.  \n\n\nNow, pardon me, I need to go search the void for my stomach.\n\n***\n\nEnjoy what you've read?
